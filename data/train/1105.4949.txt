    "hubble s observations ( 1929 ) can be approximated as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the velocity ( toward or away from us ) of the galaxy being observed .",
    "apart from a very few nearby galaxies , redshifts are positive indicating that the galaxies are receding away from us . the velocity of recession being proportional to its distance from us is explained by invoking the expansion of the universe .",
    "@xmath5 , the constant of proportionality , is called the hubble constant and it measures the rate of expansion at the present epoch .",
    "the hubble constant enters into various cosmological calculations and its importance can never be underestimated .",
    "it decides the value of critical density @xmath6 , the amount of matter and energy required to make the geometry of the universe flat . by comparing @xmath6 to the observed density one can decide the geometry of the universe .",
    "most importantly it sets the age of the universe ( @xmath7 ) and hence , size of the observable universe ( @xmath8 ) . due to its importance determining its accurate value",
    "is of paramount importance .",
    "accurate measurement of the hubble constant can also lead to test the cosmological principal ( cp hereafter ) . according to cp",
    "the universe is homogeneous and isotropic at any given cosmic epoch . if the cosmological principal is valid than one would expect the average value of hubble constant to be same in different regions and in different directions .",
    "this issue has been addressed by various authors .",
    "we discuss some of the earlier results below .",
    "+ * are we living in a bubble ? : * if the matter distribution is not homogeneous , it causes variation in the value of hubble constant .",
    "since gravity pulls we expect that if a region of space has higher density then the average density the expansion rate will be negatively affected and thus the hubble constant will be smaller in this region .",
    "in contrast to the local mass concentration a region with low mass density will produce larger value of @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite provided the first evidence for a large local void .",
    "they measured @xmath5 within and outside @xmath9mpc using sne ia to find that the value of @xmath5 was @xmath10 higher than that outside .",
    "this indicates a low density inner region compared to the outside one and is known as local bubble or hubble bubble .",
    "the above authors had assumed a flat frw universe with @xmath11 in their analysis .",
    "the variation in the inside and outside values of @xmath5 decreases to @xmath12 in the @xmath13 model ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) , however , it does not disappear completely .",
    "recently @xcite revisited the problem using the latest sne ia data set and detected of the local hubble bubble at @xmath16 confidence level .",
    "however in a later publication @xcite claimed that it was a misinterpretation of color excess of supernovae . at this juncture",
    "it is difficult to say if the evidence for the local bubble is conclusive . + * variation in @xmath5 , from hst key data :*",
    "@xcite used hst key project data ( see   [ sec : hstkey ] ) to calculate the variation in @xmath5 value .",
    "the authors find that a statistically significant variation in @xmath5 of @xmath17 exists in hst key project data .",
    "the approximate directional uncertainty is @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "their results indicate two sets of extrema that dominate on different distance scales .",
    "they find differences as great as @xmath20 within and @xmath21 beyond our super - cluster . within @xmath22",
    "their results show a statistically significant difference of @xmath23 .",
    "this variation does not appear to be an artifact of galactic dust , since there is no consistent difference looking in or out of the plane of the galaxy .",
    "in fact , the overall structure in the map is inconsistent with the distribution of dust in the cobe dust maps @xcite .    at this point",
    "one pertinent question is to ask  are these variations in the measurement of @xmath5 due to a real departure from the cosmological principal ? \" on the contrary it is also possible that the data itself has some systematic errors due to some non corrected physical processes in the universe or there could be some real issues with the data reduction / calibration process . in order to comment on",
    " what is the real cause of the variations ? \" , a critical review of the measurement methods is required .",
    "measuring accurate value of the hubble constant is a challenging task .",
    "one requires accurate measurement of redshift @xmath24 and the distance @xmath25 .",
    "although redshift can be measured with good accuracy from the spectrum of the light emitted by the object , the distance measurement is difficult .",
    "various methods are employed to measure distances , namely tully - fisher relation ( tfr ) , surface brightness ( sb ) fluctuations , fundamental plane ( fp ) relation , sne type ii , sne type ia , sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) , gravitational lensing etc .",
    "unfortunately most of these methods suffer from the systematic effects arising from many different causes .",
    "for instance sze requires the 3-d distribution / shape of the plasma ( hot gas ) in the galaxy clusters .",
    "radio and x - ray images of the clusters provide only the projected x - ray surface brightness and cmb decrement .",
    "hence simplified assumptions about the shape of the cluster are made .",
    "again the assumption about the phase and the temperature of the plasma are ad hoc @xcite . in another example",
    "the uncertainty in the physical basis of tully - fisher relation can cause subtle systematic variances in the tf relation with environment .",
    "a critical review on the subject of @xmath5 measurement methods can be found in @xcite .",
    "since there are many sources of systematics , special attention was needed to measure the accurate value of @xmath5 . the most accurate experiment to achieve this was the hubble space telescope ( hst ) key project @xcite .",
    "we shall discuss the hst key project in the next section , however the issues with this data have been mentioned in previous paragraphs .",
    "in the present paper we intend to put constraints on the cp using the @xmath5 data .",
    "this can be achieved by looking for direction dependent signatures in the data . as has been pointed out earlier detecting the direction dependent signatures",
    "does not guaranty departure from isotropy and hence cp . in that case",
    "one can constrain the reliability of the data .",
    "we use a technique @xcite , based on extreme value theory to accomplish this .",
    "another important issue with any data set is the presence of non - gaussian errors . since central limit theorem ( clt )",
    "predicts that the errors in the data should be gaussian , the non - gaussian errors are undesired and may indicate some unresolved issues . as a by product of our method we are able to detect the presence of non - gaussian features in the errors , which makes our methods useful not only in the case of @xmath5 data but for any data set in general .",
    "plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "we discuss hst key project in ",
    "[ sec : hstkey ] , which is the main source of our data .",
    "we discuss our methods in ",
    "[ sec : method ] .",
    "since our techniques are based on extreme value theory ( evt hereafter ) we discuss it briefly in ",
    "[ sec : evt ] .",
    "results and conclusions are presented in   [ sec : result ] and   [ sec : conclusion ] respectively .",
    "measuring an accurate value of @xmath5 was one of the motivating reasons for building the nasa / esa hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "measurement of @xmath5 with the goal of 10% accuracy was designated as one of three  key projects \" of the hst @xcite .",
    "the overall goal of the hst key project was to measure h0 based on a cepheid calibration of a number of independent , secondary distance determination methods .",
    "many times the systematic errors dominate the accuracy of distance measurement . to overcome this the hst team averaged over the systematics and used a number of different methods to measure distances instead of relying on a single method alone .",
    "determining @xmath5 accurately requires the measurement of distances far enough away so that both the small- and large - scale motions of galaxies become small compared to the overall hubble expansion . to extend the distance scale beyond the range of the cepheids ,",
    "a number of methods that provide relative distances were chosen .",
    "the hst cepheid distances were used to provide an absolute distance scale for these otherwise independent methods , including the type ia supernovae , the tully - fisher relation , the fundamental plane for elliptical galaxies , surface brightness fluctuations , and type ii supernovae .",
    "the final result of hst key project @xcite was @xmath26 + * data set :* we have chosen data from the hst key project @xcite as our primary data set .",
    "this set contains 74 data points and provides a reasonably full sky coverage .",
    "different methods used in order to this data set are : the tf relation , the fp relation , the sb fluctuations and sne type ia , sne type ii . in addition",
    "we have chosen 2 data points from @xcite .",
    "in all the cases recessional velocities have been corrected to the cmb frame and thus all the @xmath5 values belong to cmb frame .",
    "the full data set is published in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we investigate the direction dependent systematic effects , which exhibit anisotropy in the cosmological data .",
    "we identify the direction where the effect of the systematics is maximum . to estimate its statistical significance",
    "we need to know the distribution of this maximum , which can be computed using extreme value theory ( evt ) . since it is not a common tool in the arsenal of astronomers , we begin with a brief introduction of evt .",
    "it was developed in parallel to the central limit theory ( clt ) . while clt describes limiting distribution of partial sums ,",
    "evt describes how the distribution of extremes ( maxima / minima ) looks like .",
    "below we discuss the theory of maxima , however , the results obtained can be easily reformulated to obtain the distribution of minima .",
    "we shall outline the basic ingredients to obtain the theoretical distribution .",
    "let f be a distribution with its right end point @xmath27 which may be infinite , i.e. @xmath28 we randomly choose a sample ( @xmath29 ) of size @xmath30 from this distribution .",
    "the maximum of this sample will approach @xmath31 for large @xmath30 i.e. @xmath32 as @xmath33 .",
    "the distribution of maxima has the following probability @xmath34 where @xmath35 are assumed to be independent .",
    "this converges to zero for @xmath36 and to unity for @xmath37 , which means that @xmath38 is a degenerate distribution .",
    "a normalization of variable @xmath39 is required in order to get a non - degenerate distribution .",
    "we choose linear normalization @xcite .",
    "let us assume that there exists a sequence @xmath40 , and @xmath41 real such that @xmath42 has a non - degenerate limiting distribution as @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the required distribution .",
    "it is very difficult to derive the general form of @xmath46 , we mention some of the results available in literature .",
    "we state a theorem due to fisher and tippett @xcite which describes the required distribution .",
    "the distribution of maxima @xmath47 has the following form : @xmath48^{-1/{\\varepsilon } }   \\right ) \\ ,   \\label{eq : gx}\\ ] ] with @xmath49 .",
    "where @xmath50 is called the shape parameter or the extreme value index .    proof of this theorem @xcite is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we only outline a few interesting facts :    * when @xmath51 : + tailor expansion of @xmath52^{-1/{\\varepsilon}}$ ] gives @xmath53 .",
    "thus eq  [ eq : gx ] gives @xmath54 this is known as the gumbel distribution or extreme value distribution of type i. the right end point of this distribution is infinity .",
    "also @xmath55 as @xmath56 , indicating that the distribution has a thin tail .",
    "it is clear from the form of gumbel that it is unbounded on either side that is , there is no @xmath57 for which @xmath58 . a sketch of gumbel distribution is shown in fig  [ fig_evt : gum ] .",
    "* when @xmath59 : + @xmath60 for all @xmath57 , i.e. the right end point of the distribution is infinity .",
    "also as @xmath56 , @xmath61 . which indicates that the distribution has a heavy tail",
    ". this is called frechet distribution , or type ii extreme value distribution .",
    "one can clearly see that this distribution has a lower bound .",
    "* when @xmath62 : + the right end point of the distribution is @xmath63 .",
    "this is known as weibull distribution , or extreme value distribution of type iii .    .",
    ", scaledwidth=60.0% ]    in the above discussion we have not mentioned the location and scale parameters for simplicity . when we introduce these parameters , the form of @xmath46 becomes complicated as shown below @xmath64^{-1/{\\varepsilon } }   \\right ) \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the location parameter and @xmath66 is the scale parameter .    for our analysis we shall use the gumbel distribution since the variable of interest",
    "there does not have bound on either side .",

    "\\right )   \\ , \\ ] ] the probability distribution ( pdf ) can be derived by differentiating eq  [ eq : gumbel ] .",
    "two new techniques , namely @xmath68 and @xmath1 statistics based on extreme value theory , were derived in @xcite .",
    "we apply the same method here , however we briefly mention these techniques for completeness .",
    "first we calculate the best fit value of @xmath5 for the _ complete data set _ by minimizing @xmath70 , defined below @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the @xmath73 point in the data set and @xmath74 is the observed standard error .",
    "this minimization gives us the best fit value @xmath75 .    using this best fit value we now define @xmath76 for the @xmath73 data point as @xmath77 where @xmath75 is the best fit value of the hubble constant .",
    "we shall consider subsets of the data set to construct our statistic .",
    "we define the reduced @xmath70 in terms of @xmath76 as follows @xmath78 where it should be noted that by ` reduced ' we do not mean ` per degree of freedom ' , since we _ do not fit _ the model separately to the subsets of the data . here",
    "@xmath70 is an indicator of the statistical scatter of the subset from the best fit value @xmath75 .",
    "if the cosmological principle holds then the value of the hubble constant should not depend upon the direction in which it is measured .",
    "we use this fact to choose specific subsets of data .",
    "we divide the complete data into two hemispheres , labeled by the direction vector @xmath79 , and take the difference of the reduced @xmath70 computed for the two hemispheres separately to obtain @xmath80 , where we have defined north as that hemisphere towards which the direction vector @xmath79 points .",
    "we are only interested in the magnitude of this difference , therefore , we take the absolute value of @xmath81 , and then vary the direction @xmath82 across the sky to obtain the maximum absolute difference @xmath83 we note that since the same data point appears in several subsets , the maximization is not done over statistically independent measures of our statistic .",
    "another noteworthy fact is that if the direction dependence has a forward - backward symmetry then this statistic will not be able to detect it .",
    "however , due to its ease of construction and use we consider this simplest of possible statistics .    to interpret our results we need to know the range of @xmath68 that we can expect if there were no direction dependence in data , and the noise in the measurements were gaussian .",
    "the spatial distribution of measurements is not uniform on the sky , therefore , the number of measurements in the two hemispheres , for a given direction , varies with the direction @xmath82 in a complicated manner .",
    "therefore one might expect the probability distribution function @xmath84 to be extremely complicated , however , extreme value theory ,   [ sec : evt ] , shows that the distribution is , in fact , a simple , two parameter gumbel distribution , characteristic of extreme value distribution type  i : @xmath85\\,\\exp\\left    [ -\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\dchisq - m}{s}\\right)\\right]\\,\\,,\\ ] ] where the position parameter @xmath86 and the scale parameter @xmath87 completely determine the distribution .    to quantify departures from isotropy we need to know the theoretical distribution @xmath88 .",
    "even though we know what to expect in a general manner , it is difficult to obtain the parameters @xmath87 and @xmath86 analytically , therefore , we calculate this distribution numerically by simulating several sets of gaussian distributed @xmath76 on the measurement positions and obtaining @xmath68 from each realization .",
    "if the noise in the data is gaussian then the above distribution adequately quantifies the directional dependence in the data .",
    "but if the data has non - gaussian noise then the theoretical distribution can not be used to quantify the level of significance of our possible discovery of anisotropy .",
    "we construct an independent test for directional dependence by obtaining the bootstrap distribution @xmath89 , which is constructed in the following manner .",
    "the observed @xmath76 s are assumed to be drawn from some unknown , direction dependent probability distribution .",
    "we shuffle the data values @xmath90 and @xmath74 over the measurement positions , thus destroying any directional alignment they might have had due to anisotropy .",
    "thus we are able to generate several realizations of data and estimate the distribution @xmath89 .    in order to know what to expect from this statistic we simulate data and calculate the above mentioned bootstrap and numerical distributions .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mock ] . as had been discussed in @xcite",
    "there exists a specific bias between the two distributions .",
    "since the numerical distribution is obtained by assuming @xmath76s to be gaussian random variates with a zero mean and unit variance , therefore , it does not have any bounds .",
    "however the bootstrap distribution is obtained by shuffling through a _ specific realization _ of @xmath76 where the @xmath76s are obviously bounded .",
    "it is clear that on the average this should produce slightly smaller values of @xmath69 in comparison to what one expects from a gaussian distributed @xmath76s .",
    "our results for @xmath69 statistic in this paper should be interpreted with respect to figure  [ fig : mock ] .",
    "concerns regarding the small number of data points in data set and its effect on the efficacy of our method can be addressed ( as in @xcite ) by noting that this figure is produced with only @xmath91 points and the theoretical and the bootstrap distributions look similar .      as mentioned above",
    ", @xmath93 does not contain information about whether the measurement is above or below the fit i.e. greater or smaller than @xmath75 . an obvious generalization that does contain this information",
    "can be obtained by considering a statistic based on @xmath76s .",
    "we consider two subsets of data defined by two hemispheres labeled by the direction vector @xmath82 , containing @xmath94 and @xmath95 data points , where the total number of data points , @xmath96 , and define the quantity @xmath97 clearly @xmath98 and @xmath99 . from the central limit theorem @xcite it follows that for @xmath100 , the quantity @xmath101 follows a gaussian distribution with a zero mean and unit variance . as in the previous case",
    "we maximize this quantity by varying the direction @xmath82 across the sky to obtain the maximum absolute difference",
    "@xmath102    this statistic differs from the previous one in that the @xmath92 statistic has a theoretical limit where the position and the shape parameters can be determined analytically .",
    "given @xmath103 independent directions on the sky we are essentially determining the maximum of a sample of size @xmath103 where the individual numbers are drawn from a gaussian distribution with a zero mean and unit variance .",
    "in the limit @xmath104 the parameters are given by @xcite @xmath105 where we have to additionally assume that the number of measurements @xmath106 , since the distribution for @xmath107 becomes gaussian only in this limit .",
    "this is convenient since at least for large data sets , which will be available in the future , a comparison with theory becomes simpler .",
    "however , for a smaller number of measurements ( data points ) there is a possibility that not all directions are independent , in fact , it is quite possible that two directions contain exactly same subsets in the two hemisphere . in this situation is is clear that the total independent directions is a smaller number than @xmath103 and thus theoretical distribution would be rightward shifted and also more sharply peaked .",
    "for this reason we also calculate the bootstrap distribution and the theoretical distribution in the same manner as for the previous statistic .",
    ".best fit value for @xmath5 [ tbl : h0_bf ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     first we obtain the best fit value , @xmath75 , of the hubble constant for the data , which is shown in table  [ tbl : h0_bf ] .",
    "the large value of @xmath70 suggests that the error bars may have been underestimated .    *",
    "@xmath68 statistic :* we have applied the @xmath68 statistic to this data and calculated the bootstrap and theoretical distributions for the hst key project data , as discussed earlier .",
    "the theoretical and bootstrap distributions for this data are shown in fig  [ fig : pdf_chisq ] . to interpret our results we compare with fig  [ fig : mock ] .",
    "we see that the theoretical distribution has been shifted far away on the left side of the bootstrap distribution .",
    "this contradicts to the fact that bootstrap distribution should lie slightly to the left of the theoretical distribution , as explained above , indicating the non - gaussian nature of errors in the data .",
    "hst key data lies outside the theoretical distribution , but is close to the peak of the bootstrap distribution .",
    "this suggests that either the data is free from direction dependent systematics or a more sensitive technique is required to put constraints on these systematics .    *",
    "@xmath1 statistic :*    we apply @xmath1 statistic to the data and calculate the bootstrap and numerical distributions .",
    "these are shown in fig  [ fig : pdf_chi ] . here",
    "also the numerical distribution lies to the left of the bootstrap distribution , which is in contradiction to the expected relative positions of the two .",
    "interestingly , in this case we have an advantage , since we can calculate the theoretical distribution analytically .",
    "this analytic distribution is shown by dotted line in fig  [ fig : pdf_chi ] .",
    "it was discussed in ",
    "[ sec : method_chi ] that if all the directions are not independent then the analytic distribution should lie on the right side of the numerical distribution and should be peaked sharply .",
    "this is what we observe in fig  [ fig : pdf_chi ] .",
    "bootstrap distribution lies to the right of the analytic distribution , however , we find that it is wider than what we would expect from a true gumbel distribution .",
    "this indicates that the bootstrap distribution is not truly gumbel , therefore , it should be compared with the numerical distribution , which is calculated in a manner that is identical to the bootstrap one .",
    "comparison shows that the two distributions differ in a manner identical to the difference seen in fig  [ fig : pdf_chisq ] , based on the @xmath69 statistic ; indicating a similar level of non - gaussianity .",
    "we also find that the position of the data lies outside the 1 @xmath2 region from the peak of the bootstrap distribution .",
    "we have applied the @xmath68 and @xmath1 statistics to the data .",
    "we find that in both the cases the bootstrap and the theoretical distributions are very different from each other .",
    "thus we conclude that the nature of the errors in the data is non - gaussian .",
    "@xmath68 statistic does not show direction dependence in the data , however , @xmath1 statistic which is more sensitive to the direction dependence , shows the presence of direction dependent systematics at around one @xmath2 level .",
