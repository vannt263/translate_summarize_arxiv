    "genes , mutation , evolution and ageing have been topics of intensive research @xcite , particularly after the recent genome project . in 1995 , a bit - string computer simulation model for population evolution was introduced by penna @xcite which successfully encompassed all those elements . the penna model , essentially a mutation accumulation model ,",
    "has been so successful that it has rapidly established itself as a major model for population simulations @xcite .",
    "recently , analytical solutions have been presented for the steady states of the penna model @xcite , shedding insights into the inter - relationships between various penna parameters of the simulation model . here , we build upon this analytical framework to study populations undergoing steady growth or decline and to study the transient behaviour of the model when the system is away from its steady states .",
    "previous attempts @xcite to analyse the population dynamics did not have the advantage of the full analytic steady state solution @xcite , and consequently could not fully explore the dynamics of the model .",
    "we find that the fluctuations in a population away from steady state can be decomposed into a collection of modes each of which decays exponentially with its respective time constant .",
    "the long time behaviour of a population will therefore be dominated by the modes with the largest time constants .",
    "our analytical results are confirmed by comparison with simulation results .",
    "in the penna model @xcite , an organism s genome is represented by a bit - string .",
    "organisms age in time steps and at each timestep an organism reads the corresponding bit from the bit string ( e.g.  2nd site at age 2 ) .",
    "if a site contains a @xmath0 the organism develops a disease , and once it has accumulated @xmath1 diseases it dies . in any timestep",
    "an organism can reproduce with probability @xmath2 .",
    "the child s bit - string is a copy of the parent s with a probability @xmath3 of each site mutating into a @xmath0 .",
    "positive mutations are rare in nature so a @xmath0 mutating into a @xmath4 is forbidden in the model .",
    "variants of the penna model exist in which an organism can only reproduce between certain ages , and in which there is an external death rate giving each organism a genome - independent chance of death in any timestep .",
    "traditionally @xcite the penna model is implemented computationally and the population controlled by the use of a verhulst factor @xcite which controls either the birth rate or external death rate .",
    "the bit string is @xmath5 bits long to enable bitwise manipulation on integer type variables .",
    "the finite length bit string is an artifice of simulation and is not an important consideration when approaching the model analytically .",
    "a solution to the penna model in the steady - state has been developed and is capable of dealing with a wide range of modifications to the model , namely arbitrary birth and survivability functions @xcite .    by building upon the steady - state solution it is possible to consider dynamic behaviour .",
    "the simplest form the steady - state solution takes is for the simple penna model in which there is no non - genetic source of death , an organism dies after a single disease ( @xmath6 ) and can reproduce with equal probability at any point during its life . for simplicity we present our dynamics analysis within this simple penna model , since it is straightforward to generalise to the case of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the steady - state solution @xcite to the simple penna model is given in brief below :    an organism within the penna model can be uniquely characterised by its age @xmath8 and the number of @xmath4s on its bit - string before the first @xmath0 .",
    "the number of @xmath4s determines how long the organism lives and is termed its string - length @xmath9 .",
    "where @xmath10 is the number of organisms with age @xmath8 and string - length @xmath9 at time - step @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the probability of avoiding a mutation . in the stationary - state @xmath14 and given that an organism with string - length @xmath9 lives for @xmath9 timesteps , the sum over ages of @xmath15 is @xmath16 .",
    "the sum over ages is written as @xmath17 .",
    "then eqn .",

    "penna model dynamics can be divided into three cases : ( a ) the birth rate or / and mutation rate are altered from their steady state values leading to growth or decline of the total population @xmath28 , and associated changes in the distribution @xmath29 of the sub - populations with string - lengths @xmath9 .",
    "( b ) a change in @xmath29 from the steady - state distribution predicted in equation ( [ spm_solution ] ) is followed by relaxation back to the steady - state . ( c ) within a sub - population @xmath29 , the distribution of ages @xmath15 can fluctuate with time if the population is not in steady state .      with an unsuitable choice of birth rate , mutation rate and maximum string - length present in a population , stationary - state behaviour will not be found .",
    "eventually the behaviour of the entire population will be dominated by the growth or decline of the longest @xmath9-type .",
    "the population can exist in a state of steady growth or decline in which the relative sizes of sub - populations remain the same .",
    "the governing equation can be written as @xmath30 if we label the rate of growth @xmath31 , then in any timestep the number of young produced is @xmath32 times that in the previous timestep .",

    "@xmath44 in the limit of vanishing @xmath31 , a power series expansion of these expressions will give , to leading order , equations ( [ spm_lmax],[spm_b ] ) .      for sub - population dynamics",
    "we consider the time - step evolution of an arbitrary distribution of @xmath29 ( @xmath45 ) where the birth and mutation rate take their steady - state values .",
    "the dynamics of sub - populations within the penna model can be considered to be that of a series of decay modes .",
    "any sub - population can be expressed as the sum over contributions from a set of decay modes such that @xmath46 where the constants @xmath47 are to be determined . within each decay mode ,",
    "labelled by its index @xmath48 , the population dies away exponentially so that @xmath49 within each mode there is a maximum value of @xmath9 above which @xmath50 is zero , this is labelled @xmath51 .",
    "the mode index @xmath48 is chosen so that @xmath48 is the number of non - zero sub - populations within the mode .",
    "once the relationship between @xmath10 and @xmath52 has been established equation ( [ penna_equation ] ) can be considered to be a sum of eigen - equations each of which governs the behaviour of a given mode .",
    "the equation governing the time - step evolution of the longest string - length within a mode can be written as @xmath53 the time step evolution of @xmath54 is known ( [ lambda ] ) so the sum over ages can be evaluated and @xmath55 identified as the solution to the equation @xmath56 the characterstic decay time @xmath57 for any mode is defined as the time taken for the mode to decay to @xmath58 of its initial size .",
    "@xmath55 ( + ) and decay time @xmath57 ( @xmath43 ) plotted against @xmath51 for a simple penna model with @xmath23 , @xmath24.,width=288 ]    manipulation of equation ( [ penna_equation ] ) for an individual mode gives a recursion relation for the relative sizes of sub - populations within a mode @xmath59 where @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 each mode mimics the behaviour of a population undergoing steady decline , as given in equation ( [ steady - growth ] ) .",
    "note that the dynamic nature of this model means that the general steady - state solution presented in @xcite does not give a recursion relation of exactly this nature .",

    "decomposition of an @xmath38 distribution into decay modes can be done using a ` top down ' approach : the largest value of @xmath9 for which @xmath68 gives the @xmath51 value for the largest mode , @xmath47 is then chosen so that @xmath69",
    ". having determined @xmath47 , @xmath70 follows as : @xmath71 .",
    "this process is repeated , accounting for all contributions from higher modes at each @xmath9 , until all @xmath47 are determined .",
    "any distribution of @xmath38 ( @xmath72 for @xmath73 ) can be uniquely broken down into decay modes .",
    "the dynamic and steady - state behaviour of the simple penna model is dependent on the distribution of ages taking a particular form .",
    "an arbitrary distribution of @xmath15 will have its own dynamic behaviour and must be considered as a seperate case . in the simple penna model the evolution of @xmath15 over time without contributions from mutation can be dealt with by a leslie matrix @xcite of rank @xmath9 acting on a vector @xmath15 where the vector components correspond to ages . for @xmath15",
    "the allowed ages are @xmath74 and the timestep evolution can be descibed by the following matrix equation @xmath75 where the matrix @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 we require eigenvalue solutions to this so that @xmath78 @xmath79 are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath76 .",
    "these eigenvalues can be identified as non - unity solutions to the polynomial @xmath80 the large eigenvalues give decay at roughly the rate predicted from the @xmath29 analysis and oscillation around this decay .",

    "a simple penna model simulation was run with @xmath2 and @xmath21 chosen to give @xmath23 .",
    "the population was initialised with @xmath85 with the exception of a spike at @xmath86 where @xmath87 organisms were created .",
    "the simulation was then allowed to run generating data for @xmath29 at each iteration .",
    "as the maximum lifespan in the population is less than @xmath20 the population will eventually decay away to nothing .",
    "the spike was chosen as the intial distribution as any initial distribution can be considered to be a sum of such spikes .    initially the dynamics of @xmath88 will be dominated by age distribution dynamics and can not be explained in terms of modes .",
    "after @xmath89 iterations this noise has all but disappeared and the subpopulation can be seen to decay exponentially as predicted by equation ( [ lambda ] ) ( see fig .  [ n25_plot ] ) . all other subpopulations",
    "initially grow to later enter a period of exponential decay ( see fig  [ ndecay_plot ] ) .    considering",
    "the population after @xmath89 iterations , modes with @xmath90 will play an insignificant part in the long term dynamics of any subpopulation .",
    "after large number of timesteps @xmath91 , each sub - population , to a good approximation , can be represented by the highest few modes ( with largest decay times ) : @xmath92 the notation used is @xmath93 where @xmath48 is the mode index , @xmath91 is the number of timesteps after the @xmath89th iteration .",

    "the population is initialised with @xmath95 and all other @xmath15 set to zero .",
    "the sudden drop in population at @xmath96 timesteps arises because all of the initial population die once they reach age @xmath96 .",

    "the analytical results are obtained using only the highest 4 modes.,width=288 ]    taking more modes into account will give a more accurate picture so that the behaviour of any subpopulation can be described exactly ( in the absence of age dynamic induced noise ) by @xmath100",
    "as a natural extension to our work on the steady - state penna model we have considered and obtained analytical expressions for the various forms of dynamics which can be displayed by a simple penna model . our approach can be applied to the governing equations derived in @xcite to analyze the dynamics of a variety of penna models , such as those with external death rates and birth cutoffs . for multiple disease penna models ( @xmath7 )",
    "the breakdown of the population into decay modes remains valid so long as there is no bias in the distribution of non - terminal mutations within bit - strings .",
    "the decay coefficients ( @xmath55 ) and relationship between @xmath50 within modes for models with @xmath7 .",
    "are given as they may be of particular interest .",
    "each @xmath55 satisfies @xmath101 the recursion relation between successive sub - populations within a mode is @xmath102 where @xmath60 is unchanged from the single mutation case and given by equation ( [ l_k ] ) .",
    "the dynamic behaviour we have considered is for unregulated populations where there is no verhulst factor and steady state is obtained by suitable choice of birth rate and mutation rate .",
    "dynamics in the presence of a verhulst factor is considerably more complicated as any change in a sub - population will act to change the birth ( or death ) rate , affecting all other sub - populations .",
    "the modes , which in the absence of a verhulst factor are independent , become coupled through a shared birth ( or death ) rate .",
    "the resulting series of coupled , non - linear difference equations can not be generally studied using the decay modes analysis we have presented . however , depending how the verhulst factor is implemented there may be regimes in which the coupling between decay modes is sufficiently weak that they may be treated as independent ."
