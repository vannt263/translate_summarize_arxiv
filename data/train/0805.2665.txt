    "recent astronomical observations of distant supernovas snia type strongly indicate that the current universe is undergoing an accelerated phase of expansion @xcite .",
    "if the universe evolution is described by homogeneous and isotropic models filled with a perfect fluid then the acceleration should be driven by a perfect fluid violating the strong energy condition .",
    "if different candidates for a fluid termed dark energy are suggested , the simple candidates for the dark energy in the form of positive cosmological constant seems to be the best one @xcite .",
    "while the lambda cdm model is a good phenomenological description of the acceleration phase of the expansion of the universe there is serious problem with the interpretation of the lambda term as a quantum vacuum energy because of the fine tuning problem @xcite .",
    "our studies show that when the lcdm has the status of an effective theory which offers description of the observational facts rather than their explanation this theory introduces principally the new theoretical element which plays the role of an effective parameter changing dramatically the dynamics .    the theory which is called an effective theory ( although it is not yet a technical notion ) is characterized by a few important features , as follow :    * an effective theory _ works _ in a certain field of physics .",
    "in most cases this scope of application is described in terms of energy or distance scale .",
    "the theory which is  effective  in a specific physical regime describes ",
    "behavior  of elaborated objects but often does not explain the nature of them .",
    "for example the standard model is the effective theory of gluons and quarks in the distant scale of @xmath0 m. intuitively that feature of effective theories was described by h. georgi @xcite : + _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ( ... ) we can divide up parameter space of the world into different regions , in each of which there is a different appropriate description of the important physics .",
    "such an appropriate description of the important physics is an  effective theory  .",
    "the two key words here are appropriate and important .",
    "the word  important  is key because the physical processes that are relevant differ from one place in parameter space to another .",
    "the word  appropriate  is key because there is no single description of physics that is useful everywhere in parameter space @xcite . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * every effective theory uses parameters which can be called  informational input  being assigned to the theory without explanations ; i.e. we do not have to understand the nature of these _ input parameters _ as to successfully operate the theory .",
    "it is important to distinguish _ input parameters _ from any kind of information being used by the theory or model ( initial conditions for example ) .",
    "specific parameters do have the status of _ input parameters _ only in the frame of the effective theory .",
    "their values can be determined experimentally but only more fundamental theory in fact provides an explanation for them being like that . * therefore , we can say for example that the nucleus spin , the elementary charge or the magnetic property are _ input parameters _ for the effective theory which uses them successfully but without understanding nature of them .",
    "the effective theories can be put into specific series with respect to _ the input parameters_. this is called by some philosophers of science a tower of effective theories @xcite .",
    "* we have written that an effective theory could be used in a certain area of physics .",
    "indeed this kind of theory _ works _ successfully (  effectively  ) on that level but it breaks down when we exceed the limits of its application .",
    "the very important feature of limited applicability criterium is an easily separation of these regimes . *",
    "the effective theories coexist with each other .",
    "let s consider two cases .",
    "we presented in table i a few examples of coexisting ( but independent ) different dark energy models . in this case",
    "one can speak of sets of models .",
    "if two or more theories or models are used to solve current physical problem ( for example the problem of accelerating universe ) we can evaluate their _ effectiveness _ by pointing out what type of knowledge they provide .",
    "it is also possible to explain relations between effective theories in terms of structures .",
    "an effective theory is not a fundamental theory .",
    "we called that kind of structure of effective theories  the series or tower of theories .",
    "it is possible because the theories of that kind not only coexist with each other ( but not in the same regime ) but also under condition of each other .",
    "the theory on the lower level determines some parameters for the theory of upper one .",
    "that kind of relation can be elaborated by using the notions of emergence or supervenience . if we study that series of the effective theories we can meet the problem of a fundamental theory , a base  theory .",
    "this final theory actually",
    "_ ends _ that series in the terms of a methodological reconstruction , but at the same time _ begins _ the series in the framework of emergence .",
    "one can speculate about the possibility of existence of the fundamental theory , but there are also opinions that searching for the series of effective theories leads to theoretical view described by expression : _ never - ending tower of effective theories _ @xcite .",
    "we study methodological status of the concordance cosmological lcdm model from the view point of the debate on reductionism and emergence in science @xcite .",
    "our main result is that structural stability notion taken from the dynamical system theory may be useful in our understanding of the emergence cdm to lcdm model as well as in understanding of the reduction lcdm to cdm one .",
    "we argue that the concepts of structural stability might be a suitable setup for the philosophy of cosmology discussion .",
    "the lcdm model should be treated in our opinion as an effective theory for the following reasons :    1 .",
    "theory of gravity which describes the gravitational sector of cosmology is very complicated but if we postulate some simplified assumption like symmetry assumption idealization then we obtain simplest model which can be representing in the form of the dynamical system . in the cosmology assumption of homogeneity and isotropy of space like sections of constant cosmic time ( @xmath1 ) seems to be justified by the distribution of large scale structure of astronomical objects ( cosmological principle ) .",
    "if we assume that the topology of spacetime is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a maximally symmetric 3-dimensional space then we obtain a geometrical structure of the spacetime modulo a single function of @xmath4 called the scale factor . in order",
    "if we postulate that source of gravity is in the form of perfect fluid with energy density @xmath5 and pressure @xmath6 then einstein field equation reduces to the ordinary system of differential equation determining a single function @xmath4 .",
    "these equations called friedmann equations frw model describe the evolution of the universe at the large scale .",
    "of course this model is very simplified but it can be very useful instrument of construction of a new effective theory of the universe ( heuristic function of the model ) .",
    "recently many authors ( see @xcite ) argue that observational cosmology will change significantly the essence of our world - view .",
    "basing on this simple toy model one can effectively derive observables ( for example cosmological tests ) which can be used in testing theory itself ( function of testing the theory ) . note that this is impossible basing on general relativity without the symmetry assumption where there is universal time conception .",
    "the general acceptance of the lcdm model as the working is good strategy @xcite but one may also seek alternative physics ( pragmatism ) .",
    "after many years of hypotheses and markets of models we have standard cosmological models which is leading as to joint the physical model of the world .",
    "einstein field equations constitute in general very complicated system of partial nonlinear differential equations but in the cosmology important role plays its solutions with some symmetry assumptions postulated at the very beginning .",
    "usually an isotropy , homogeneity itself and its symmetry are assumed . in this case",
    "einstein field equations can be reduced to the system of ordinary differential equations , i.e. dynamical systems . hence to the cosmology",
    "could be applied the dynamical system methods in natural way .",
    "the application of these methods allows to reveal some stability properties of particular visualized in geometrical way as the trajectories in the phase space .",
    "hence one can see how large is the class of solutions leading to the desired property in tools of the attractors and the inset of limit set ( an attractor is a limit set with an open inset  all the initial conditions that end up in the some equilibrium state ) .",
    "the attractors are the most prominent experimentally .",
    "it is because the probability of an initial state of the experiment to evolve asymptotically to the limit set it is proportional to the volume of inset .",
    "the idea , now called structural stability emerged early in the history of dynamics investigation in 1930 s the writings of andronov , leontovich and pontryagin in russia ( 1934 ) @xcite ( the authors do not use the name _ structural stability _ but rather the name  roughly systems  ) . this idea is based on an observation an actual state of the system can never be specified exactly and application of the dynamical systems might be useful anyway if it can describe the features of the phase portrait that persist when the state of the system is allowed to move around ( see @xcite for more comments ) .    among all dynamicists there is shared prejudices that :    1 .",
    "there is a class of phase portraits that are far simpler than arbitrary ones which can explain why a considerable portion of the mathematical physics has been dominated by the search for the generic properties .",
    "the exceptional case should not arise very often in application and they de facto interrupt discussion ( classification ) @xcite .",
    "2 .   the physically realistic models of the world should possess some kind of the structural stability because having so many dramatically different models all agreeing with observation would be fatal for the empirical method of science @xcite ( see also @xcite .",
    "these prejudices in the holton terminology can be treated as a thematic principles @xcite . in the cosmology a property ( for example acceleration ) is believed to be  physically realistic  if it can be attributed by the generic subsets of the models within a space of all admissible solutions or if it possesses a certain stability , i.e. if it is shared by a ",
    "epsilon perturbed model  .",
    "for example g.  f.  r. ellis @xcite formulated so called a probability principle  the universe model should be one that is a probable model within the set of all universe models  and a stability assumption which states that  the universe should be stable to the perturbations  .",
    "the problems are how to define :    1 .   the space of state and its equivalence , 2 .",
    "the perturbation of the system .",
    "the dynamical system is called structurally stable if all @xmath7-perturbation of it ( sufficiently small ) have the epsilon equivalent phase portrait . therefore for the conception of structural stability we considered a @xmath7-perturbation of vector field determined by the right - hand sides of the system which is small ( measured by delta ) .",
    "we also need a conception of the the epsilon equivalence .",
    "this has the form of topological equivalence  a homeomorphism of the state space preserving the arrow of time on each trajectory . in the definition of structural stability",
    "considers only the deformation of  rubber sheet ",
    "type stretches or slides the phase space a small amount measured by epsilon .",
    "there are developed other concepts of stability used by some authors @xcite .",
    "for example concepts of rigidity and fragility is used in the sense that the attractor solutions never change as long as some conditions are met . in the structural stability conception",
    "the global dynamics is important rather than the fragility of solutions against changes in the shape of a functional form of the hubble function .",
    "it is also used the concept of rigidity in the context of a final theory of physics ( toe ) . roughly speaking a mathematical structure",
    "is said to be rigid , with respect to a certain deformation parameter , if its all deformation with respect to this parameter yields again the same structure @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting that while the deformation parameter is not defined uniquely , the deformation procedure can be strictly defined .",
    "the main advantage of the structural stability is that it is the characterization of global dynamics itself .",
    "recently , properties of structural stability of cosmological models were investigated by s. kokarev @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) . in the introduction to the paper author",
    "claims that the history of cosmology shows that corrections of cosmological models are realized mainly by the sequence of their , in some sense  small  , modifications and some of them may ",
    "survive  after small changes , while the other may disappear . in the former case the property",
    "is referred to as  rough  or structurally stable , in the later one ",
    " thin  or structurally unstable .",
    "the author studies how some model properties , like singularities for example , will be present in the model if we",
    " perturb  the model ( for example generalize the lagrangian of general relativity ) . in our approach",
    "the property of structural stability is the property of the model itself .",
    "also the type of perturbations is not specified ( epsilon perturbation idea ) .",
    "therefore , if we prove the structural instability of cdm model , the result will not depend on the choice of the type of perturbation .",
    "then the property of structural stability becomes its constitutive property at the very beginning without restriction to the class of perturbation induced by considering new theories with generalized lagrangian .",
    "[ fig:1 ] illustrates the property of structural stability of single spiral attractor ( focus ) and saddle point and structural instability of center .",
    "the addition of a delta perturbation pointing outward ( no matter how weak ) results in a point repeller .",
    "we call such a system structurally unstable because the phase portrait of the center and focus are not topologically equivalent ( notice that all phase curves around the center are closed in contrast to the focus .",
    "hence one can claim that a pendulum system ( without friction ) is structurally unstable .",
    "idea of structural stability attempts to define the notion of stability of differential deterministic models of the physical processes . in the case of planar dynamical systems",
    "( as in the case of models under consideration ) there is true peixoto theorem ( peixoto 1982 ) @xcite which states that structurally stable dynamical systems form open and dense subsets in the space of all dynamical systems defined on the compact manifold .",
    "this theorem is basic characterization of structurally stable dynamical systems in the plane which offers the possibility of exact definition generic ( typical ) and nongeneric ( exceptional ) cases ( properties ) in tools of the notion of structural stability .",
    "unfortunately there is no counterparts of this theorem in more dimensional case when structurally unstable systems can also form open and dense subsets .",
    "for our aims , it is important that peixoto theorem can give the characterization of generic cosmological models in terms of potential function @xmath8 of the scale factor @xmath9 which determine the motion of the system of newtonian type : @xmath10 .    therefore we can treat frw equation with various forms of dark energy as the two - dynamical systems which looks like newtonian type where the role of coordinate variable is played by the cosmological radius ( or redshift @xmath11 : @xmath12 ) . we can construct an effective potential , the second order acceleration equation has exactly the newtonian form , where the role of a coordinate variable is played by the cosmological radius .    using the term of the structural stability introduced first by andronov , leontovich and pontryagin in thirties , one can classify different models of cosmic acceleration .",
    "it will be demonstrated that models with the accelerating phase which follows the deceleration are natural and typical from the point of view of the dynamical systems theory combined with the notion of structural stability in contrast to the models with bounces . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] there are illustrated two cases : a ) inverted single - well potential and b ) more complicated form of the potential with two maxima corresponding to the saddle point and minimum corresponding to the center ( structurally unstable ) .",
    "let us introduce the following definition :    if the set of all vector fields @xmath13 @xmath14 having a certain property contains an open dense subset of @xmath15 , then the property is called generic .    from the physical point of view",
    "it is interesting to know whether certain subset @xmath16 of @xmath15 ( representing a class of cosmological accelerating models in our case ) contains a dense subset because it means that this property ( acceleration ) is typical in @xmath8 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "it is not difficult to establish some simple relation between the geometry of potential function and the localization of critical points and its character for the case of dynamical systems of newtonian type :    1 .",
    "the critical point of the system under consideration @xmath17 , @xmath18 lies always on @xmath19-axis , i.e. they are representing static universe @xmath20 , @xmath21 ; 2 .",
    "the point @xmath22 is a critical point of the newtonian system if it is a critical point of the potential function @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is total energy of the system @xmath26 ; @xmath27 for the case flat models and @xmath28 in general ) ; 3 .",
    "if @xmath22 is a strict local maximum of @xmath23 , it is a saddle type critical point ; 4 .",
    "if @xmath22 is a strict local minimum of the analytic function @xmath23 , it is a center ; 5 .",
    "if @xmath22 is a horizontal inflection point of the @xmath23 , it is a cusp .",
    "therefore the geometry of potential function will determine the critical points as well as its stability .",
    "the integral of energy defines the algebraic curves in the phase space @xmath29 which are representing the evolution of the system with time . in any case",
    "the eigenvalues of the linearization matrix satisfy the characteristic equation @xmath30 .",
    "the cosmology is based on the einstein field equation which represents a very complicated system of partial nonlinear differential equation .",
    "fortunately , the majority of main class of cosmological models from the point of view of observational data , belong to the class of the spatially homogeneous ones , for which has sense the absolute cosmological time . as a consequence , the evolution of such models can be reduced to the systems of ordinary differential equations . hence to the cosmology could be naturally applied the methods of dynamical system theory or qualitative theory of differential equation . among these class of models",
    "especially interesting are the cosmological models with maximally symmetric space sections , i.e. homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "they are called frw models ( friedmann - robertson - walker ) if source of the gravity is a perfect fluid described in terms of energy density @xmath31 and pressure @xmath32 , both are the functions of cosmological time @xmath33 .",
    "the frw dynamics is described by two basic equations : @xmath34 where the potential @xmath35 , @xmath9 is the scale factor and @xmath36 is hubble s function , a overdot means the differentiation with respect to the cosmological time @xmath33 .",
    "the first equation is a consequence of the einstein equations for the component ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , ( 3,3 ) and the energy momentum tensor @xmath37 .",
    "this equation is called the raychaudhuri or acceleration equation .",
    "the second equation represents the conservation condition @xmath38 .",
    "it is very strange and unreasonable that such two simple equations satisfactorily describe the universe evolution at the large scales .",
    "of course there is a more general class of cosmological models called the bianchi models which has only the symmetry of homogeneity but they do not describe the current universe which is isotropic as indicated measurement of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb)radiation .",
    "the system of equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) admit the first integral called the friedmann equation @xmath39 where @xmath40 is curvature constant @xmath41 and @xmath31 plays the role of effective energy density .    if we consider the lambda cdm model then @xmath42 i.e. energy density is a sum of dust matter ( cold ) and dark energy .",
    "therefore the potential function for the flat frw model assumes the following form : @xmath43 or in terms of redshift @xmath44    formally the curvature effects as well as the cosmological constant term can be incorporated into the effective energy density ( @xmath45 ; @xmath46 ; @xmath47 ) .    to represent the evolutional paths of cosmological models in this form is popular since peebles monograph @xcite ( see also @xcite and modern applications @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the form of equation ( 1 ) suggests the possible interpretation for the evolutional paths of cosmological models as a motion of a fictitious particle of unit mass in a one - dimensional potential parameterized by the scale factor . following this interpretation the universe is accelerating in the domain of configuration space @xmath48 in which the potential is a decreasing function of the scale factor . in the opposite case",
    "if potential is a growing function of @xmath9 the universe is decelerating .",
    "the limit case of zero acceleration corresponds to an extremum of the potential function .",
    "it is useful to represent evolution of the systems in terms of the dimensionless density parameter @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is present value of hubble s function . for this aim",
    "it is sufficient to introduce the dimensionless scale factor @xmath51 which measures the value of @xmath9 in the units of the present value @xmath52 ( which we choose ) and reparameterize the cosmological time following rule @xmath53 .",
    "hence we obtain a 2-dimensional dynamical system describing the evolution of cosmological models : @xmath54 and @xmath55 where @xmath56 @xmath11 is redshift ; @xmath57 for dust matter and quintessence matter satisfying the equation of state @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "the form ( 6 ) of the dynamical system opens the possibility of adopting dynamical system methods in investigations of all possible evolutional scenarios for all possible initial conditions .",
    "theoretical research in this area obviously shift from founding and analyzing particular cosmological solution to investigating a space of all admissible solutions and discovering how certain properties ( like acceleration , existence of singularities for example ) are  distributed  in this space .",
    "the system ( 6 ) is hamiltonian one and adopting hamiltonian formalism into the admissible motion seems to be natural .",
    "this gives at once insight into dynamics of accelerating universe because our problem is similar to the problems of classical mechanics .",
    "it is achieved due to particle like description of accelerating cosmology .",
    "this cosmology identifies the unique form of the potential function @xmath23 .",
    "different potential functions for different propositions of solving the acceleration problem contains table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    ".the potential function for different dark energy models [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     it is the interesting question whether the global dynamics of the cdm model is structurally stable under a perturbation term .",
    "the global structure of dynamics ( phase portraits ) depends on the geometry of potential function because its localization as well as character depends on the first and the second derivatives of potential function @xmath60 , @xmath61 respectively , where @xmath62 are eigenvalues of the linearization matrix of the system and are a solution of the characteristic equation @xmath63 .",
    "we reduce the dynamics to the 2-dimensional system in the form @xmath64 ( or @xmath65 ; @xmath66 ) , where @xmath67 is the constant of energy .    from the above equation",
    "one can be seen that all critical points ( right - hand sides of the system are vanishing ) are situated on the axis @xmath19 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "from the characteristic equation we obtain that for the dynamical system under consideration only three types of critical points are admissible    1 .",
    "saddle if @xmath69 and @xmath70 ; 2 .",
    "focus if @xmath71 ; 3 .   degenerated critical point if @xmath72 .",
    "therefore in the first case the eigenvalues are real of opposite signs , and in the second one they are purely imaginary . because the center and degenerated ( non - hyperbolic ) critical points are structurally unstable only in the presence of single saddle point to guarantee the structural stability of the system at finite domain .",
    "the critical points @xmath73 of the perturbed system satisfy the condition @xmath74 therefore at least there is only present such a single critical point .    because the second derivative of the potential function is always upper convex ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath75 and critical point if exists is saddle type .",
    "if we consider only lambda term in the perturbation ( i.e. the lcdm model ) then other terms do not change the global phase portraits of the lcdm system or all perturbed systems are topologically equivalent .",
    "the relation of global dynamics on the phase plane is the equivalence relation , therefore the lcdm model can be treated as a representative model in this class .    after the introducing the projective map covering a circle at infinity @xmath76 one can check that the system admits the critical point @xmath77 which corresponds to @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( or @xmath80 ) , i.e. , the big - rip singularity .",
    "this critical point is degenerate , therefore the whole system is structurally unstable .",

    "if we consider the cdm models perturbed by chaplygin gas then we obtain the phase portrait equivalent to lcdm .    while cdm system is structurally unstable because of the presence of non - hyperbolic critical points , the lcdm model is structurally stable .",
    "the following statement will characterize structurally stable dynamical system of newtonian type describing perturbation of cdm models .",
    "let us consider more complicated @xmath83 class potential function @xmath84 than single inverted well potential ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ) for example with two maximum points .",
    "thus must exist minimum critical points .",
    "but its presence means that we have a centre in the phase space , i.e. the system is structurally unstable .     plane . ]    if @xmath8 is @xmath83 function of scale factor ( or redshift ) , then there is only one differentiate type of the critical point ( modulo diffeomorphism ) which determines the structurally stable global phase portrait .",
    "this global dynamics is equivalent to the lcdm one .",
    "finally the lcdm model is the simplest structurally stable generic perturbation of the cdm model which is nongeneric .",
    "the emergence of the lcdm model one can understand as a transition from a zero measure set of a dynamical system on the plane toward such which forms the open and the dense subsets in an ensemble of the dynamical systems on the plane  models of the deterministic processes .",
    "in our discussion it would be useful to consider a common approach to reduction in physics , so called _ deductive criterion of reducibility _ of nagel @xcite . in this conception reduction",
    "is a relation of derivation between upper - level and base - level theories . in upper - level theory",
    "has termed not already in the base - level one , the terms must be connected using bridge laws .",
    "let us consider two models which must be connected using the cosmological parameter .",
    "this parameter plays the role of control parameter in the model and we assume that it assumes zero ( vanishes ) in the basal model .",
    "we are looking for weakly emergent properties of the model which can be derived ( via bifurcation ) from the complete knowledge of the basal model information .",
    "for this aims we use bifurcation theory , from that information about new unveiling properties of the system can be predicted , at least in principle as we change the control parameter .",
    "then in principle we can derive the system behavior because we can perform bifurcation analysis answering the question how the structure of the phase space qualitatively changes as parameter @xmath85 is moved . as a result we can predict its future behavior with complete certainty .",
    "such a point of view seems to be very close traditional conceptions of emergence ( broad , popper , nagel ) that focus on unpredictability properties of upper - level model even given complete the basal information .",
    "let us illustrate our point of view in the very simple but instructive example .",

    "basal and upper - level models and reducibility see @xcite .",
    "also interesting experiences of emergence new type of dynamical behavior give us hopf bifurcation phenomena ( * ? ? ?",
    "* s. 341 ) .",
    "this bifurcation can occur in the system with parameter @xmath120 at a nonhyperbolic equilibrium point @xmath73 when the matrix @xmath121 had a simple pair of pure imaginary eigenvalue and no other eigenvalues with zero real point . in the generic case hopf bifurcation",

    "this type of behavior plays important role in the description route to turbulence scenario",
    ". it would be worthy to mention the important role of hopf bifurcation in rulle - takens scenario of route to deterministic chaos .",
    "the concept of turbulence war originally introduced by landau in 1944 and later revised by ruelle and takens in 1941 @xcite . according to landau",
    ", turbulence is reached at the end of an indefinite superposition of oscillatory bifurcations , each bringing its unveiling phase into dynamics of the system . in the ruelle - takens scenario",
    "infinite number of periodic behavior is not required when nonlinearities are acting .",
    "they argue that turbulence should be treated as a stochastic regime of deterministic chaos at which we have long term unpredictability due to property of sensitive dependence on initial condition .",
    "this stage is reached only after a finite and small number of bifurcation .",
    "for some recent philosophical discussion of significance of chaos see @xcite .",
    "in conventional methodology of deriving einstein equation one derives the equation of motion from the lagrangian which is a sum of @xmath123 - lagrangian for gravity and @xmath124 - lagrangian for matter source which we assume that depends on both metric @xmath125 and the scalar field @xmath126 .",
    "therefore there are two different ways of introducing the cosmological constant . in the first approach we put them into the gravitational lagrangian , i.e. @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is a parameter in the ( low energy effective ) action just like the newtonian gravitational constant @xmath129 .",
    "the second route is by shifting the matter lagrangian @xmath130 .",
    "therefore a shift is clearly equivalent to adding the cosmological constant @xmath131 to the @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "the symmetry @xmath132 is a symmetry of matter sector .",
    "the matter equation of motion do not care about @xmath133 . in the conventional approach gravity",
    "breaks this symmetry .",
    "this is the root case of the so - called cosmological constant problem .",
    "as long as gravitational field equation are in the form @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is some geometrical quantity ( @xmath136 in g.r . )",
    "the theory can not be invariant under the shifts of the form @xmath137 . since such shift are allowed by the matter sector it is very difficult to imagine a solution to the cosmological constant within the conventional approach to gravity @xcite .",
    "if the metric represents the gravitational degree of freedom that is varied in the action and we demand full general covariance , we can not avoid @xmath138 coupling and can not obtain of the equation of motion which are invariant under the shift @xmath139 .",
    "clearly a new dramatically different approach to gravity is required .",
    "the main aim of this paper was to show the effectiveness of using the framework of dynamical system theories ( especially the notion of structural stability and tools of bifurcation analysis ) in study on a weak emergence and reducibility of two cosmological models cold dark matter model and lambda cold dark matter model .",
    "the latter model contains the cosmological constant term which is favored by recent observational data of the current universe .",
    "we have shown the structural instability of cdm model and that value of lambda zero is bifurcation value of cosmological constant .",
    "for interpretation of this analysis in the weak emergence context we consider levels the notion of states ( the same theory with the lambda term ) instead of the notions of basal and upper level .",
    "the level is corresponding to cdm model and any other level is parametrized by the cosmological constant .",
    "the bifurcation analysis reveals a new property of the upper level  namely de sitter state at which the universe permanently stays in the accelerating phase of evolution .",
    "bifurcation analysis shows that lcdm model has a new property ",
    "de sitter asymptotic state ( property offering explanation of the observational data ) .",
    "the structural instability of cdm model informs us that this model is fragile and its small perturbation changes the structure of evolutional laws .",
    "this result has a purely qualitative character and does not depend on postulated type of perturbation . in some sense structural instability property",
    "informs us about a new property of the model which appears in the model after its perturbation .",
    "we have also demonstrated nonreducibility of solutions of lcdm upper state after taking the limit @xmath104.it is consequence of structural instability of the lower state representing cdm model . of course it is a reduction of the level of basic equation but never on the level of its solutions.the analogical problem appear in the wayne analysis of limit cycle behavior emergence in nonlinear system . in this case",
    "@xmath140 is bifurcation value of parameter . in our interpretation space of state of the system",
    "can be parametrized by epsilon parameter which measures the strength of the nonlinear term . as a consequence bifurcation analysis reveals a new type of dynamical behavior for any value of epsilon parameter .",
    "this upper state can not be reduced to the basal state because there is a place for limit cycle behavior in the linear systems .",
    "we can find strict analogy to the system under consideration of cosmological origin and wayne analysis of emergence and singular limits . following the common approach to reductionism in physics",
    ", so called deductive criterion of reducibility of nagel(1961 ) , the reduction is a derivational relation between upper level and base level theories .",
    "the structural instability of the models learn us that one should distinguish the derivational relation on the both level of basic equation and the level of solutions .",
    "notice that , if the model is structurally stable , such distinct is not necessary",
    ".    we always , in the mathematical modeling of physical processes , try to convey the features of typical , garden - variety , dynamical systems . in mathematics",
    "the exceptional cases are more complicated and numerous , and they interrupt the physical discussion . moreover dynamicists shared an opinion that such exceptional systems not arise very often because they are not typical . in the history of mathematical dynamics",
    "we observe how we have searched for generic properties .",
    "we would like to distinguish a class of phase portraits that are far simpler than the arbitrary ones .",
    "this program was achieved for dynamical systems on the plane by peixoto due to the conception of structural stability introduced by andronov and leontovich in 1934 . the criteria for structural stability rely upon two supplementary notions : a perturbation of the phase portraits ( or vector field ) and the topological equivalence ( homeomorphism of the state phase ) .",
    "a phase portrait has the property of structural stability if all sufficiently small perturbations of it have equivalent phase portraits .",
    "for example if we consider a center type of critical points then the addition of perturbation pointing outward results in a point repellor which is not topologically equivalent to the center .",
    "this is a primary example of structurally unstable system . in the opposite case saddle type of critical point",
    "is structurally stable and the phase portrait does not change under small perturbation .",
    "in this paper we define the class of frw cosmological models filled by dark energy as a two - dimensional dynamical systems of a newtonian type .",
    "they are characterized through the single smooth effective potential function of the scale factor or redshift . among these class of models we distinguish typical ( generic ) and exceptional ( nongeneric ) cases with the help of structural stability notion and the peixoto theorem .",
    "we find that the lcdm model in opposition to the cdm model is structurally stable .",
    "we demonstrate that this model represents a typical structurally stable perturbation of cdm one .",
    "therefore , the transition from the cdm model of the universe toward the lcdm one , which includes the effects of the cosmological constant , can be understood as an emergence of the model from the exceptional case to the generic one .",
    "this case represents a generic model in this sense that small changes of its right - hand sides do not change the global phase portraits . in the terms of the potential ,",
    "the second order differential equation one can classify different models of cosmic acceleration . it is shown that models with the accelerating phase ( which follows the deceleration ) are natural and typical from the point of view of the dynamical systems theory combined with the notion of structural stability .    it is interesting that the new class of lambda perturbated solutions does not reduce to the cdm model solutions ( which reveals their new quality ) , although the corresponding equation reduces to the cdm one after taken limit @xmath141 .",
    "the small value of lambda parameter dramatically changes its asymptotic states ( de sitter asymptotic is emerged ) .",
    "the universe is accelerating for some value of redshift transition @xmath142 and this phase of acceleration is followed by the deceleration phase dominated by matter .",
    "one can say that the lcdm model is emerging from the cdm model as the universe evolves .",
    "this very simple two phases model of past evolution of the universe give rise to its present acceleration detected by distant supernovae .",
    "therefore , the simplicity and genericity are the best guides to understanding of our universe and its acceleration .",
    "more complicated evolutional scenarios are exceptional in the space of all models with a 2-dimensional phase space .",
    "there are many different theoretical possibilities of explaining accelerating universe in terms of dark energy ( substantial approach ) or using modification of gravity ( nonsubstantial approach ) . among all candidates the lcdm model is favored by bayesian selection methods @xcite .",
    "these methods indicate the best model in respect to admissible data .",
    "one can ask why the lcdm model is the best one .",
    "our answer is that the lcdm model possesses a property of simplicity and in the same time flexibility with respect to the data .",
    "the latter can be interpreted in the tools of the structural stability notion .",
    "the observations indicates that we live in expanding universe with current accelerations .",
    "it seems that this acceleration phase proceeded the deceleration phase .",
    "provided that we assume that there was no other qualitative dynamical changes in whole evolution of the universe ( at early as well as late time ) the lcdm model is sufficiently complex to explain such a simple evolution of the universe .",
    "no simpler neither the more complex model can be better description of the universe dynamics .",
    "the future evolution of our universe is eternal expansion with the accelerating phase according to the lcdm scenario .",
    "other possible futures given by other models are unjustified because of the structural instability .",
    "such futures are highly improbable because they require a very special fine - tuned model to the reality .",
    "it seems that there is possibility of an ideal description of the physical reality in such a way that our model is no more a model but described reality itself . in this case",
    "the structural stability or instability does not matter .",
    "but when as in cosmology we have a bunch of models which very roughly describe the universe evolution ( the effective theories ) they should accommodate the reality inside the error margin generated by the perturbation . but this feature is possessed by the structural stable models only .",
    "this is an argument in favor of dealing with structural stable models in cosmology .",
    "we have found the only structural stable two - phase model of universe dynamics with a deceleration and then acceleration phase is the lcdm model .      this work has been supported by the marie curie actions transfer of knowledge project cocos ( contract mtkd - ct-2004 - 517186 ) .",
