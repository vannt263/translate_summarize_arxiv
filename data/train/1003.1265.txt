    "grb afterglows are likely produced by relativistic blast waves propagating from the center of the explosion .",
    "this model is , however , challenged by recent observations . in particular , the _ swift _ satellite revealed several puzzling features in the x - ray afterglow .",
    "it observed an early plateau stage and flares with fast rise and decay times ( nousek et al .",
    "2006 ; burrows et al . 2005 ) .",
    "less frequent but even more bizarre are sudden drops in the x - ray light curve ( as steep as @xmath0 in grb  070110 , troja et al . 2007 ) .",
    "these behaviors are inconsistent with the standard model of afterglow production .",
    "can the emission from the forward or reverse shock of the blast wave show strong variations on timescales @xmath1 ?",
    "it is usually argued that this is impossible : the spherical curvature of the emitting surface ( of radius @xmath2 and lorentz factor @xmath3 ) implies a spread in arrival times of its emission , which washes out variability on timescales shorter than @xmath4 for a relativistic blast wave , this duration is comparable to the observed time passed since the beginning of the explosion , @xmath5 .",
    "this appears to prohibit any rapid and strong variations in the light curve ( see ioka et al .",
    "2005 for discussion ) .",
    "therefore , the observed fast variability in afterglows is usually associated with additional emission from radii much smaller than the blast - wave radius .",
    "this model invokes a late activity of the central engine ( zhang et al .",
    "the material ejected at large @xmath6 and emitting at radii @xmath7 will have @xmath8 and can produce flares with @xmath1 .",
    "note however that ( i ) it is unclear in this model why the observed flares have the approximately universal @xmath9 ( chincarini et al .",
    "2007 ; lazzati & perna 2007 ) , ( ii ) the very steep drops at the end of some plateaus can hardly be explained by this model unless it assumes that the entire plateau is produced at small radii inside the ejecta and the emission from the blast wave is negligible ( kumar , narayan & johnson 2008 ) .",
    "another difficulty for grb theory is that many afterglows lack the predicted ` jet breaks ' ( burrows & racusin 2006 ; sato et al .",
    "2007 ) : only a small fraction of afterglow light curves show a clear achromatic break that is expected from jets ( willingale et al . 2007 ) .",
    "some bursts show x - ray light curves extending for tens to hundreds of days with a constant temporal slope ( grupe et al .",
    "the interpretation of these observations is difficult and often leads one to assume large jet opening angles , implying in some cases extremely high energy for the explosion ( shady et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "an implicit assumption in the general discussion of these puzzling features is that the emission is isotropic in the rest frame of the relativistically moving source ( however , see lyutikov 2006 ) . in this paper , we discuss the effects of a possible anisotropy and suggest that they can help explain observations . in section",
    "[ sec : response ] we write down a general formula for the observed flux from a flashing sphere when the emission is anisotropic in the source rest frame . in section  [ sec : effects ]",
    "we list the consequences of anisotropy for the curvature effect , the jet break in the afterglow light curve and the size of the radio image of the blast wave . in section  [ sec : meca ] we consider the standard radiative mechanism of afterglows  synchrotron emission  and discuss its anisotropy .",
    "the results are summarized in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "let an energy @xmath10 ( measured in the lab frame ) be instantaneously emitted by a sphere of radius @xmath2 , which is expanding with a lorentz factor @xmath3 and a velocity @xmath11 .",
    "distant observers will see the emitted radiation extend over a range of arrival times @xmath6 due to the curvature of the emitting surface .",
    "the observed light curve @xmath12 from the flashing sphere can be thought of as a green function of afterglow emission or ` response function ' that describes the curvature effect .",
    "it depends on the intrinsic angular distribution of the source intensity .",
    "let @xmath13 be the photon angle with respect to the radial direction in the local rest frame of the emitting sphere .",
    "the intrinsic ( comoving ) angular distribution of emission ( per unit solid angle ) can be described by function @xmath14 normalized by @xmath15 isotropic emission in the comoving frame corresponds to @xmath16 .",
    "the photon angle in the static lab frame @xmath17 is related to @xmath13 by @xmath18    a distant observer will first see photons emitted along the line of sight with @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath20 be the arrival time of these first photons .",
    "photons received at a later time @xmath6 come from a larger co - latitude @xmath17 on the emitting sphere , related to @xmath6 by @xmath21 a time interval @xmath22 corresponds to a ring @xmath23 on the sphere .",
    "the true energy emitted by this ring is @xmath24 .",
    "the ring is viewed at angle @xmath25 with respect to its normal , and the observed photons are doppler - boosted in energy by the factor @xmath26 .",
    "doppler effect also compresses the solid angle of emission by the factor of @xmath27 .",
    "together with anisotropy @xmath14 , doppler effect determines the amplification factor for the _ apparent _ isotropic equivalent of emitted energy , @xmath28 the observed luminosity is @xmath29 , which yields @xmath30 where @xmath13 and @xmath17 are related by equation  ( [ eq : thlab ] ) .",
    "substitution of @xmath31 and @xmath32 $ ] gives an explicit expression for the light curve produced by the flashing sphere .",
    "these equations simplify in the limit @xmath33 , @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 is defined in equation  ( [ eq : dtobs ] ) .",
    "an isotropic source , @xmath16 , after doppler transformation to the static frame emits 75 per cent of the energy within @xmath37 .",
    "let us now consider an anisotropic source , @xmath38 .",
    "we will assume that the anisotropy has a front - back symmetry , @xmath39 ; then the net momentum of emitted photons vanishes in the source frame .",
    "consider , for instance , ` limb - darkened ' emission , which is weak near @xmath40 and strong near @xmath41 .",
    "doppler transformation to the lab frame strongly amplifies the radiation with @xmath42 and weakens radiation with @xmath43 . as a result , a bright narrow beam is created , so that 75 per cent of energy is now concentrated within @xmath44 . here @xmath45 is a measure of the enhanced beaming of radiation in the lab frame . the beam @xmath46 is emitted with @xmath47 in the source frame , and one can show that @xmath48 is related to @xmath49 by @xmath50 the increased beaming in the lab frame ( @xmath45 ) due to limb - darkening in the source frame ( @xmath51 ) has several observational consequences that we list below .      the curvature effect is expected to control the observed light curve if the source power suddenly drops .",
    "the observed luminosity @xmath52 responds to the drop with a delay according to equation  ( [ eq : rf ] ) . if the emission is isotropic in the source frame , the delay timescale is @xmath53 , and the steepest possible decay is @xmath54 with @xmath55 ( e.g. kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) .",
    "since limb - darkening of the source implies stronger beaming , @xmath56 instead of @xmath57 , most of the energy is radiated on a shorter timescale , @xmath58 , and the slope @xmath59 is much steeper .",
    "we will discuss this effect in more detail in section  4 .",
    "it turns out that a similar conclusion holds for the opposite , limb - brightened , type of anisotropy , when emission is strong near @xmath40 and weak near @xmath41 .",
    "grb jets are likely to have a small opening angle @xmath60 , which reduces their energy @xmath61 ( here @xmath62 is the isotropic equivalent of the jet kinetic energy ) .",
    "a break should be observed in the afterglow light curve at moment @xmath63 when the relativistic beaming angle @xmath64 becomes larger than @xmath65 ( rhoads 1997 ) , and the value of @xmath65 may be inferred from observed @xmath63 .",
    "if the afterglow source is limb - darkened so that @xmath56 , the jet - break condition becomes @xmath66 , i.e. effectively @xmath65 is replaced by @xmath67 .",
    "the standard light - curve analysis can only give the value of @xmath67 , which overestimates the true @xmath65 by the factor of @xmath49 .",
    "the true @xmath68 for a limb - darkened jet is reduced by the factor of @xmath69 compared with the usual estimate .",
    "limb - darkening also implies a significant delay in @xmath63 .",
    "for example , consider a blast wave decelerating in a uniform medium .",
    "its lorentz factor decreases as @xmath70 .",
    "the jet break occurs when @xmath66 , and this moment is delayed by the factor of @xmath71 .",
    "the usual expression for @xmath63 then becomes @xmath72 similarly , for a blast wave decelerating in a wind medium , @xmath73 and hence @xmath74 .",
    "even a moderate anisotropy ( e.g. @xmath75 , which corresponds to limb - darkening with @xmath76 in the source frame ) can delay the jet break by a large factor ( @xmath77 in a uniform medium , @xmath78 in a wind ) .",
    "this could be enough to not detect the jet break with current observational capabilities as the afterglow is dim at late times and the spectral coverage is incomplete to test achromaticity .",
    "vlbi observations provided the angular size of the radio image of a few grb afterglows ( frail et al .",
    "1997 ; taylor et al .",
    "2005 ) which helps constrain the ratio of the blast wave energy to the density of the environment .",
    "the best data have been obtained for grb  030329 and seem to favor a blast wave in a uniform medium with @xmath79  erg  @xmath80 and @xmath81  rad ( pihlstrm et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the apparent size of the afterglow source is given by ( e.g. oren , nakar & piran 2004 ) @xmath82 where @xmath2 is the radius of the emitting shell .",
    "with increased beaming due to limb - darkening , @xmath56 and @xmath83 is reduced by the factor @xmath84 . for a blast wave in a uniform medium , a derivation similar to that in oren et al .",
    "( 2004 ) gives the relation between the ratio of the true jet energy to the external density and observed @xmath83 , @xmath85 and @xmath63 , @xmath86 one can show that @xmath49 drops out from the similar relation derived for blast waves in wind media , i.e. in that case limb - darkening does not affect the relation .",
    "afterglow is commonly interpreted as synchrotron emission .",
    "its anisotropy naturally results from a preferred orientation of the magnetic field @xmath87 .",
    "magnetic fields inside grb jets are generally expected to be transverse to the jet direction , as radial expansion quickly suppresses the longitudinal component .",
    "internal or external shocks can generate magnetic fields only in the shock plane ( e.g. medvedev & loeb 1999 ) .",
    "thus , in various models of afterglow production it is reasonable to suppose that the magnetic field in the source is perpendicular to its velocity , @xmath88 .",
    "in addition , we assume that @xmath89 is tangled on a scale much smaller than @xmath90 , so that a distant observer will see a superposition of emissions from many domains with random orientations of @xmath89 .",
    "this assumption is motivated by the low polarization in observed afterglows , typically less than a few per cent ( e.g. covino et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the anisotropy of synchrotron emission may be expected to be moderate if the emitting electrons have an isotropic distribution ( see e.g. calculations by granot et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for three possible geometries of the magnetic field ) . even in this case , anisotropy is present because @xmath87 is confined to a plane . after averaging over random directions of @xmath89 ,",
    "one finds the angular distribution of emitted power per electron , @xmath91 here @xmath92 is the power of synchrotron emission per electron and @xmath93 is thomson cross section .",
    "the resulting radiation is limb - darkened .    in reality",
    ", the electron distribution may not be isotropic : electrons may be preferentially accelerated along or perpendicular to the magnetic field , depending on the acceleration mechanism .",
    "for instance , the details of electron acceleration in relativistic shocks remain uncertain , despite significant progress in numerical simulations ( e.g. hededal et al .",
    "2004 ; spitkovski 2008 ; nishikawa et al .",
    "2009 ) , and other mechanisms are possible .",
    "we therefore consider both types of electron anisotropy .",
    "let @xmath59 be the pitch - angle of an electron with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "we will describe the distribution of electron directions @xmath94 by the function @xmath95 , normalized by @xmath96 .",
    "synchrotron emission from each electron is strongly beamed along its velocity , and together the electrons emit radiation with angular distribution , @xmath97 the average power per electron is now given by , @xmath98    equation  ( [ eq : aniso ] ) describes the angular distribution relative to the local magnetic field .",
    "the angle @xmath59 between the magnetic field and the observer s line of sight is given by @xmath99 where @xmath100 depends on the orientation of @xmath88 .",
    "using equation  ( [ eq : aniso ] ) and averaging over random directions of @xmath89 , one finds that the synchrotron emission has the following angular distribution , @xmath101\\,d\\phi.\\ ] ]    let us consider two toy models : @xmath102 where @xmath103 defines a characteristic beaming angle of the electron distribution .",
    "these expressions represent two opposite cases where electrons are preferentially accelerated along @xmath87 ( distribution @xmath104 ) and perpendicular to @xmath87 ( distribution @xmath105 ) .",
    "both distributions becomes isotropic if @xmath106 .",

    "we show three cases : isotropic emission @xmath16 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( same as in fig .  3 ) .",
    "the limb - brightened emission @xmath112 produces a very steep decay in the light curve .",
    "we conclude that extremely fast variations in the light curve , e.g. short flares or steep drops , may be observed in synchrotron afterglows if electrons are preferentially accelerated along @xmath87 , as the response function can be arbitrarily narrow for @xmath107 .",
    "note that the emission is limb - brightened in this case , i.e. the situation is opposite to what was considered in section  3 , and the description using @xmath45 does not apply .",
    "limb - brightening has little or no effect on @xmath63 or @xmath83 , in contrast to the limb - darkened model of section  3 .",
    "another implication of the preferential electron acceleration along @xmath87 is the reduction of synchrotron emissivity by a factor of @xmath132 ( cf .",

    "all synchrotron - emission formulae contain only the component of @xmath87 perpendicular to the electron velocity , which equals @xmath134 for @xmath107 .",

    "the synchrotron model with angular distribution @xmath113 , does not predict significant changes in the afterglow light curve , because limb - darkening is never strong for synchrotron emission , regardless of @xmath103 . a moderate change in @xmath63 and a less pronounced jet break",
    "may be expected compared with the case of isotropic emission .",
    "the usual assumption of isotropic emission in the rest frame of the blast wave is likely to be invalid .",
    "even the standard synchrotron model with isotropic electron distribution produces anisotropic , limb - darkened radiation ( section  [ sec : meca ] ) .",
    "this fact is a consequence of the preferential orientation of the magnetic field in the blast wave .",
    "strong limb - brightening is also possible if the radiating electrons are preferentially accelerated along the magnetic field .",
    "anisotropy may resolve a few puzzles encountered in afterglow modeling : + ( i ) the usual argument that the curvature effect filters out fast variability , prohibiting strong variations in the light curve on timescales @xmath137 , is not valid for anisotropic emission .",
    "an anisotropic variable spherical source can produce fast changes in the light curve , similar to observed bizarre features in grb afterglows .",
    "this result holds for both limb - darkened and limb - brightened types of anisotropy .",
    "it suggests that the x - ray flares observed by _ swift _ with @xmath138 do not necessarily imply an additional component of internal origin .",
    "instead they may be produced , e.g. by the reverse shock in the blast wave , whose emission may suddenly brighten and weaken as the reverse shock propagates into the inhomogeneous ejecta of the explosion",
    ". this model may also explain sudden steep drops in the afterglow light curve as observed in grb  070110 ( troja et al .",
    "this explanation assumes that the x - ray radiating particles are cooling fast compared with the jet expansion timescale , as slow cooling would suppress short time - scale variations of the source luminosity .    examples of such short times - cale behaviors are given by the toy model in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "it shows the synchrotron emission produced by a thin shell with lorentz factor @xmath139 at @xmath140 and @xmath141 at @xmath142 .",

    "the shell is assumed to radiate with bolometric power proportional to the dissipation rate in the blast wave , which gives @xmath143 at @xmath144 and @xmath145 at @xmath142 .",
    "a realistic blast wave has two shocks  forward and reverse  and both can produce a long - lived afterglow . our toy model may describe the emission from either shock , although it is very much simplified . to illustrate the curvature effect on variability ,",

    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    \\(ii ) if a relativistic source is limb - darkened , most of its emission in the fixed lab frame is confined within an angle _ smaller _ than @xmath57 .",
    "this effect suggests a possible explanation for the lack of jet - break detections in grbs , as the increased beaming significantly delays the jet break in the observed light curve ( section  3.2 ) .",
    "we also discussed in section  3.3 the consequences of such anisotropy for the apparent size of the radio afterglow source .",
    "although the strong limb - darkening appears to be impossible for standard synchrotron afterglows , it may be possible for a different radiative mechanism .",
    "for example , limb - darkening may be expected for the jitter mechanism ( medvedev & loeb 1999 ) , as the electrons are preferentially accelerated perpendicular to the shock plane and radiate preferentially in the radial direction .",
    "while this paper was focused on afterglow , the source of prompt grb emission may also be intrinsically anisotropic .",
    "this may impact models that propose the curvature effect to control the steep x - ray decay at the end of the prompt emission ( see e.g. genet & granot 2009 ; zhang et al .",
    "2009 ) . the effect can be seen in figure  4 .",
    "anisotropy of the prompt emission may also change the optical depth of the source to high - energy photons , @xmath149 , as the cross section for @xmath150 reaction strongly depends on the angle between photons .",
    "this may affect the constraints on the lorentz factor of the jet that are inferred from @xmath151 .",
    "the effect is especially strong for emission without front - back symmetry in the source frame ; such asymmetric emission would be a more radical assumption compared with the ordinary limb - brightening or limb - darkening considered in this paper .",
