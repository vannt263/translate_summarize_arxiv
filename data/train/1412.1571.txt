    "quantum spin liquids ( qsls ) are highly entangled states of matter@xcite  with remarkable properties of great intrinsic interest .",
    "the simplest and perhaps most striking subclass of qsls comprises topologically ordered states@xcite , which have a non - vanishing excitation gap , and support emergent quasiparticles with anyonic statistics and fractional quantum numbers@xcite .",
    "although qsls have been demonstrated in many contrived models @xcite , their relation to magnetically disordered phases in different frustrated systems remains poorly understood .",
    "this problem has been intensively studied in the past by many theoretical approaches .    apart from their intrinsic interest , motivation to understand qsl phases comes from recent experimental discoveries .",
    "the kagom antiferromagnets herbertsmithite and kapellasite have recently emerged as prominent examples@xcite .",
    "the absence of magnetic order is evidenced by many different techniques including muon spin rotation and susceptibility measurements @xcite , and neutron scattering measurements of herbertsmithite show a purely continuum spectrum , interpreted as a signature of fractional `` spinon '' excitations@xcite .",
    "further instances of qsls have been found in organic mott insulators with a triangular lattice structure@xcite .",
    "theoretically , qsls have been sought in spin-@xmath0 antiferromagnets with frustrated and/or competing interactions on triangular @xcite , honeycomb @xcite , square @xcite , and kagom @xcite lattices .",
    "amongst all these , the kagom heisenberg model ( khm ) appears to possess the most robust qsl phase , and the only one consistently found in unbiased density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations .",
    "the nature of the qsl is less clear .",
    "the dmrg studies suggest a gapped qsl @xcite , seemingly consistent with @xmath5 topological order @xcite .",
    "variational studies using projected fermionic parton wavefunctions favor a different , gapless dirac state @xcite .",
    "a bosonic parton wavefunction does , however , give a competitive energy for a @xmath5 qsl state in the extended @xmath1-@xmath2 khm with second - neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange @xmath2 @xcite , and other studies reinforce an enhanced qsl phase in this model @xcite .",
    "direct evidence for @xmath5 topological order is mixed : in support , a nearly quantized topological entanglement entropy was found in the @xmath1-@xmath2 model @xcite , but the expected four topological ground state sectors have not been seen in dmrg @xcite .",
    "interestingly , by introducing _ both _ second and third neighbor couplings , dmrg studies @xcite recently discovered another topological qsl on the kagom lattice .",
    "this state spontaneously breaks time reversal symmetry ( trs ) in the sense of having a complex wavefunction and non - zero scalar spin chirality @xmath6 for some triplets of nearby spins @xmath7 .",
    "such a state , proposed more than 20 years ago by kalmeyer and laughlin @xcite , is known as a chiral spin liquid ( csl ) .",
    "it can be regarded as a spontaneous fractional quantum hall effect .",
    "the csl occurs in several different kagom spin models with comparable @xmath2 and @xmath3@xcite , and indeed is _ more _ robust than the putative @xmath5 qsl state discussed earlier : all the expected universal topological properties of the csl state have been verified numerically .    in this paper , we expose the relations between the two qsl states and nearby ordered phases through a global dmrg@xcite study of the full phase diagram of the @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath3 model ( with all exchanges antiferromagnetic ) : @xmath8 good points of comparison are the classical and schwinger boson mean field phase diagrams , found in ref . .",

    "cuboc1 _ and _ cuboc2 _ , as well as a simpler @xmath4 coplanar ordered state which is time - reversal symmetric .",
    "they also conjectured that a @xmath5 trs breaking qsl `` descended '' from the _ cuboc1 _",
    "state by quantum disordering of the spins might apply to the the pure nearest - neighbor khm , and also extend to the region with small @xmath2 and @xmath3 perturbations @xcite . the dmrg phase diagram determined here",

    "these classical states surround three more quantum ones : the two aforementioned qsl states and a valence bond crystal ( vbc ) state with ordered singlets breaking translational but not spin - rotation or trs symmetry .",

    "[ cuboc1](b ) @xmath84 ( @xmath58 is the longest distance ) , and plot it versus @xmath3 in the inset , which shows a jump of @xmath67 from zero to a finite value at @xmath55 . the abrupt simultaneous onset of spin order and vanishing chiral order on small triangles ( fig .  [ chiral](b ) ) , together indicate a phase transition from the csl to a magnetically ordered phase .",
    "to be fully confident of magnetic ordering , we must consider finite size effects .",
    "we compare the spin correlations on yc8 and yc12 cylinders ( the xc12 cylinder is incompatible with _ cuboc1 _ state ) .",
    "interestingly , the _ cuboc1 _ state has significantly enhanced entanglement entropy  a point which we return to below  which prevents us from obtaining fully converged results on yc12 cylinder .",
    "therefore , we instead compare the spin correlations on the yc8 and yc12 cylinders as obtained with similar truncation errors . as shown in figs .",
    "[ cuboc1](c ) and [ cuboc1](d ) for @xmath85 , the spin correlations grow with decreasing truncation error ( increasing @xmath15 ) in both systems . for similar truncation errors ,",
    "the correlation length @xmath27 on the wider yc12 cylinder is always larger than that on the yc8 cylinder .",
    "consequently , the converged spin correlations ( obtained from extrapolation with respect to truncation error , as shown by the plus symbol ) on the yc12 cylinder are stronger than those on the yc8 cylinder .",
    "the growing spin correlation length is consistent with the presence of magnetic order in two - dimensional thermodynamic limit .",
    "now we justify the claim that the csl _ can not _ be regarded as a quantum fluctuating _",
    "cuboc1 _ state . to see this",
    ", we first consider the pattern of scalar spin chirality in the _ cuboc1 _ state .",
    "classically , the spins in triangles @xmath65 and @xmath86 are _ coplanar _ , so these possess zero scalar spin chirality .",
    "spin chirality is instead concentrated in triangles @xmath87 and @xmath88 , where the spins are non - coplanar @xcite .",
    "we indeed see precisely this behavior in the numerical calculations of chirality correlations , which are large and consistent with long - range chiral order _ only _ for triangles @xmath87 and @xmath88 , as shown in fig .  [ cuboc1](e ) .",
    "this is why the chirality calculated for the small ( @xmath65 ) triangles in fig .",
    "[ chiral](b ) jumps to zero in the _ cuboc1 _ state . in fig .",
    "[ cuboc1](e ) , we see some very small residual chirality correlations on the type 1 and 2 triangles , but these are consistent with short - range correlations , which are always non - zero and do not indicate symmetry breaking .",
    "the absence of scalar spin chirality in the small triangles in the _ cuboc1 _ state reflects an invariance of this state under a combined @xmath89 rotation in spin space ( about an axis through two antipodal points on the cuboctahedron ) and a real space reflection through a plane bisecting a column of small triangles .",
    "the csl state breaks this symmetry .",
    "hence the two phases are _ symmetry distinct _ even beyond the presence of spin ordering .",
    "for @xmath90 on the xc8 - 18 cylinder is fitted using the conformal field theory formula @xmath91 + g$ ] with @xmath92 . in ( b ) , the entanglement entropy is plotted versus @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) for @xmath90 on xc8 - 16 and xc8 - 18 cylinders .",
    "the dashed line is the fit curve used shown in ( a ) . ]    finally , we return to the entanglement entropy in the _ cuboc1 _ state . the large entropy may be understood from general arguments . in the two - dimensional limit ,",
    "the _ cuboc1 _ phase fully breaks su(2 ) spin symmetry , and so has _ three _ gapless goldstone modes ( a number equals to the number of generators of su(2 ) ) .",
    "this is described field - theoretically by an 2 + 1-dimensional so(3 ) matrix non - linear sigma model @xcite .",
    "if we now imagine placing the _ cuboc1 _ state on a ( compatible ) cylinder , the momentum along the circumferential direction @xmath95 becomes quantized , and we navely expect three gapless one - dimensional bosonic modes with @xmath96 . in general , these modes are interacting , and for long cylinders fluctuate strongly and are expected to open up a gap , since the non - linear sigma model in 1 + 1-dimensions is asymptotically free .",
    "however , this gap is exponentially small when the cylinder circumference is large , and so we can expect a wide regime in which the cylinder behaves like a system of _ three _ gapless free bosonic modes .    for a general free gapless bosonic system ( actually any conformal field theory ) in 1 + 1-dimensions , the entanglement entropy of a bipartition into two halves follows the area law @xmath91 + g$ ] @xcite , where @xmath97 is the characteristic central charge of system , @xmath98 is a nonuniversal constant reflecting short - range entanglement , and @xmath99 and @xmath20 are the length of subsystem and the whole system , respectively . the non - linear sigma model argument above implies @xmath100 .",
    "thus the large entanglement entropy of the _ cuboc1 _",
    "state on cylinders could be attributed to its goldstone mode structure .",
    "we verify this numerically in more detail , and find behavior consistent with this prediction .",
    "an example of the @xmath99 dependence of entropy is shown in fig .",
    "[ cc](a ) for @xmath101 on the xc8 - 18 cylinder .",
    "we bipartition the system column by column , and denote the number of columns as @xmath99 .",
    "the entropy fits quite well using the area law behavior with @xmath92 . in fig .",
    "[ cc](b ) , we plot the same data versus @xmath102 $ ] , where the slope of the dashed line determines the central charge .",
    "we find that the entropy on xc8 - 16 cylinder also follows the same central charge @xmath103 .",
    "it is interesting to study the phase transitions between the well established topological csl and other phases surrounding it .",
    "continuous phase transitions from such a topologically ordered phase are of general interest as examples of unconventional quantum criticality @xcite",
