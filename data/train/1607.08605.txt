    "determining the nature of galactic x - ray sources through their optical counterparts and measurements of their distance is key not only in the study of individual sources , but also in population studies of different classes of objects . in the case of x - ray emission from a compact object ( namely an x - ray binary )",
    "the former allows one to understand physical processes near the compact object .",
    "only a good knowledge of the optical counterparts to sources of x - ray emission allows testing of different theoretical models of the emission mechanisms and accretion processes . in turn , properties of different populations of x - ray sources in our and other galaxies contain information about fundamental physical mechanisms responsible for their formation and evolution and about properties of the host galaxy itself .",
    "distance estimations can be made relatively straightforwardly for x - ray sources in other galaxies , but is a non - trivial task in our own galaxy .",
    "there are at least two problems to contend with : the high density of stars , which complicates the process of optical identification , and the large and variable interstellar absorption , which complicates measurements of different properties of the source , including its distance .",
    "these difficulties have led to the situation where a significant number of galactic x - ray sources are still unclassified or have no reliable distance measurements @xcite .    in this work",
    "we utilize high quality x - ray , optical and near - infrared ( nir ) data to localize and identify the poorly studied transient x - ray pulsar s. it was discovered in 1975 by the _ sas-3 _ observatory @xcite .",
    "later a strong coherent variability , with a period of 9.3 s , was found @xcite in the source light curve .",
    "subsequent observations of s revealed strong outbursts in 2007 @xcite and most recently in 2015 @xcite .",
    "observations with the _ nustar _ observatory and _ fermi_/gbm monitor during the 2015 outburst led @xcite to the discovery of a cyclotron absorption line in the source spectrum at @xmath2 kev and to improve the accuracy of the binary parameters .",
    "moreover these authors also estimated the distance to the system @xmath3 kpc .",
    "the possible nature of s  as a pulsating be / x - ray binary system was first suggested on the basis on its transient activity @xcite and x - ray spin modulation .",
    "however , no optical or infrared counterpart had been directly determined until now .",
    "this made s  one of the first transient x - ray binaries to be discovered with a probable be - companion , though the confirmation of this and the distance to the system were still to be confirmed .",
    "moreover , the x - ray behaviour of the source is quite unusual  in particular , the source never displays type i outbursts .",
    "@xcite proposed the model of the truncated disc in which such a behaviour is naturally explained for systems with a low eccentricity . indeed , current measurements of @xcite revealed a very low eccentricity in this system @xmath4 .",
    "based on recent data from the _ chandra _ and _ swift _ observatories , southern african large telescope ( salt ) and the _ vvv _ survey , we have measured for the first time an accurate position for the x - ray pulsar s , leading to the identification of its infrared counterpart and an estimation of its distance .",
    "the source light curve obtained with the _ swift_/bat telescope in the @xmath5 kev energy band for two outbursts is shown in fig.[lcurve ] .",
    "it is seen that both outbursts are quite similar : the duration is about 3 months and the maximum intensity around @xmath6 mcrab in the @xmath5 kev energy band .",
    "the outburst light curves , duration and absence of orbital modulation are all indications that they are type ii outbursts",
    ".    observations in soft x - rays were performed twice with the _",
    "swift_/xrt telescope ( obs.ids 00031096001 and 00031096002 , red lines in fig.[lcurve ] ) and once with the acis instrument onboard the _ chandra _ observatory ( obsid . 17662 , blue line in fig.[lcurve ] ) .",
    "both xrt observations were carried out in the photon counting ( pc ) mode with a relatively high source flux that led to pile - up in the data .",
    "it was taken into account in the subsequent analysis according to the xrt data analysis threads .",
    "the data collected by the acis instrument with a total exposure of @xmath7 ks were reduced with the standard software package ciao 4.7 with caldb v4.6.5 .",
    "note , that these data did not suffer from pile - up .      as mentioned above , the optical companion of s  is not yet known , mainly because of the lack of an accurate localization of the x - ray source .",
    "the _ swift_/xrt telescope determined the position of s  during the 2007 - 2008 outburst to be ( j2000 ) : r.a.= 15@xmath857@xmath947.75@xmath10 , dec.= -54@xmath112452.4  with a 3.5 arc - second error @xcite .",
    "this was a significant improvement on the originally determined error circle of 35 arc - seconds ( _ sas-3 _ aperture size ) , but nevertheless did not lead to the determination of the optical counterpart .",
    "to determine the position of s  with a higher accuracy , we triggered a too observation with the _ chandra _ observatory on may 21 , 2015 ( mjd57163.68 ) . using the celldetect / ciao procedure ,",
    "the pulsar coordinates were determined as r.a.= 15@xmath857@xmath948.3@xmath10 , dec.= -54@xmath112453.1  ( j2000 ) with @xmath12  uncertainty ( 90% ) .",
    "these coordinates differ by more than 6  from ones mentioned in the _ simbad _ database and are about 4.8  from those reported by @xcite .",
    "to clarify the situation and to understand the reasons for this difference , we re - analysed both the archival _",
    "swift_/xrt data ( obsid.00031096001 from jan 24 , 2008 , mjd54489.84 ) and the new data obtained during the current outburst on feb 6 , 2015 ( obsid.00031096002 , mjd57059.13 ) .",
    "we calculated the enhanced source position , where the astrometry is derived using field stars in the uvot images @xcite . as a result",
    ", the best - fit source position was found as r.a.= 15@xmath857@xmath948.35@xmath10 , dec.=-54@xmath112452.7(j2000 , error radius 1.4 , 90% confidence ) , which is in good agreement with the _ chandra _ measurements .",
    "thus we have determined , for the first time , accurate coordinates of s. these coordinates were then used to search for its optical counterpart .",
    "in order to locate the optical counterpart of s , observations were taken of the region indicated by the x - ray error circles from the _ swift _ and _ chandra _ observations with the southern african large telescope ( _ salt _ ) @xcite using the imaging camera , salticam @xcite .",
    "the first observation was taken on 11 feb 2015 using @xmath13 and @xmath14 filters with 100 and 200s exposures , respectively .",
    "this was followed by a spectroscopic observation on 22 feb 2015 of the star @xmath15   se of the _ swift _ position , reported by @xcite ( the brightest star in the upper panels of fig.[image ] ) , using salt / rss @xcite with the pg900 grating covering the range 3920@xmath16990@xmath16 , at an average spectral resolution of 960 , with a 1.5 arcsec slit .",
    "a single 1300s exposure revealed a blue star with no emission features and no other compelling signatures indicative of a hmxb optical counterpart .",
    "following from the improved _ swift _ position and the subsequent _ chandra _ observation , an improved positional determination decreased the size of the error circle by a factor of 3.5 in diameter and moved it @xmath17  to the east , which then formally excluded the star previously observed .    a second , deeper",
    ", salticam imaging observation was carried out on 15 aug 2015 following the determination of the revised position .",
    "five repeat cycles of exposures in the @xmath18 and @xmath14 filters , of 120s , 120s and 600s , respectively , were obtained , plus an additional 120s @xmath19-band exposure .",
    "these observations were mostly taken in good seeing ( @xmath201 arcsec ) , with some degradation for the last few exposures , and in photometric conditions .",
    "fitted star image profiles typically had a fwhm in the range 1.2@xmath11.4 .",
    "a faint star was detected near the edge of the new _ chandra _ error circle , @xmath202  ne of the previously observed star ( fig.[image ] , green circle ) , which we term the salticam star .",
    "photometry of star images in the vicinity of s was performed in iraf using standard routines in the daophot package .",
    "given the reasonably crowded field and the close proximity of the target to a brighter star , we used psf fitting routines instead of aperture photometry .",
    "after several trial fits , we found that a moffat function better modelled the stellar profiles and so was used to produce the final instrumental magnitudes .",
    "calibration of the instrumental magnitudes was done using stellar catalogues provided by the supercosmos sky survey @xcite .",
    "the catalogue data were positionally matched with the salticam sources using a matched error of 1 .",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath19 magnitudes of the resulting matches were plotted and fit with a straight line function with gradient set to unity .",
    "the intercept was used as a calibration zero - point and was added to the instrumental magnitude of the target to produce the final calibrated magnitudes of the salticam star , namely :    @xmath21    @xmath22    note , that there is likely an additional systematic uncertainty of about 0.1 mag due to the scatter in the data used to measure the zero - point offset .    to correct for interstellar extinction",
    "we adopt the standard @xmath23 relationship @xcite and the measured column density , namely @xmath24 @xmath25 ( see sect.4 and * ? ? ?",
    "this gives an @xmath26 , and assuming the interstellar absorption law given in @xcite , leads to @xmath27 and @xmath28 values of 11.3 and 8.7 , respectively .",
    "we then derive the following corrected magnitudes and colours for the salticam star :    @xmath29    @xmath30    @xmath31    @xmath32    the @xmath33 colour was derived using the relevant transformations from the sloan to the johnson - cousins systems @xcite .",
    "note , that all bexrbs have spectral types earlier than b2-b3 @xcite , with colours redder than the results of our photometry . together with the upper limits of the near ir magnitudes ( see next section ) , this puts in doubt the connection between s  and the salticam star .      in order to further examine the validity of this potential counterpart to s and to see",
    "if the salticam star is also visible in the near infrared , we downloaded the _",
    "images for this region .",
    "these _ vvv _ survey data were obtained in frames of the eso programme 179.b-2002 , with the vircam instrument , using @xmath34 filters ( tile d_061 with 80 s exposure for each filter ) .",
    "data were obtained thought the https://vvvsurvey.org service , which provides access to reduced or fully calibrated data .",
    "surprisingly , we found there to be a total of 5 stars in the immediate vicinity of the x - ray source position ( fig.[image ] , bottom panels ) in the @xmath35-bands image ( there are only 3 in the @xmath13 image ) . to find the correct association between the x - ray source and nir star ,",
    "photometry was performed in the same way as described above for the salticam images .",
    "the star from the photometric catalogue with a position closest to the _ chandra _ position was chosen as the most likely counterpart .",
    "its coordinates are : r.a.= 15@xmath857@xmath948.28@xmath10 , dec.=-54@xmath112453.5(j2000 , error radius 0.07 , 90% confidence ) , just @xmath36  from the _ chandra _ coordinates .",
    "the calibrated @xmath37 magnitudes for this star are :    @xmath38    @xmath39    @xmath40    @xmath41    @xmath42 .    before constructing a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the proposed counterpart ,",
    "we need to be sure that the star identified in the _ vvv _ images is the most probable counterpart to the x - ray source . on inspection of the images and positions ( see fig.[image ] ) , we found that not only are the salticam and _ vvv _ sources positionally inconsistent with each other ( outside of the expected errors from our astrometry  the rms from the salticam analysis is 0.58 , averaged over both frames ) , but the _ vvv _ source is within 0.5  of the _ chandra _ position .",
    "this , along with the @xmath43 colour derived above , suggests that the salticam and _ vvv _ sources are in fact separate stars , and that the _ vvv _ star is more likely to be the correct counterpart . further to this",
    ", we find that there is no source detected in the _ vvv _ image positionally consistent with the salticam source , and vice versa .",
    "we then proceeded by treating the photometry of the two stars separately in the subsequent analysis of the seds and distance determinations .      to derive the sed for each star ,",
    "we apply upper limits derived from each image .",
    "put simply , we assume that the optical star in the salticam images is not detected in the _ vvv _ images , and thus we apply _ vvv _ @xmath34 upper limits to this star .",
    "these values were available in the headers of the downloaded _",
    "vvv _ images .",
    "likewise , we assume that the _ vvv _ star within the _ chandra _ error circle was not detected in the salticam images , and thus we apply formal @xmath19 and @xmath13 limits to this star .",
    "these were derived by plotting the brightness distribution of all sources in each band , and checking where it turns over , and thus have a statistical uncertainty , of up to @xmath44 0.5 mags .",
    "these limits were reddening corrected in the same manner as done previously ( as above , we used the @xcite formulae to determine the interstellar absorption ) , resulting in interstellar reddening corrected seds for both stars .",
    "all magnitudes ( apparent , de - reddened , absolute for the distances 15 and 20 kpc ) as well as appropriate @xmath45 values are presented in table[tabmag ] , where ( l ) denotes an upper limit .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     the detailed analysis of the broadband ( 3 - 79 kev ) spectrum of s  was recently performed by @xcite using data from the _ nustar _ observatory . it was shown that the spectral continuum contains two components  a thermal black body emission at low energies and a power law with an exponential cutoff at higher energies . additionally , a cyclotron absorption line at an energy of @xmath2 kev and a fluorescent iron emission line at 6.4 kev were detected @xcite .",
    "the working energy bands of _ swift / xrt _ and _ chandra _ have an upper bound near @xmath46 kev , and the effective area of both of them are significantly reduced at energies above 7 - 8 kev . therefore , we found it unnecessary to use such a complex model to fit our data .",
    "we found that all three source spectra in the 0.5 - 10 kev energy band can be well approximated by either absorbed black body emission ( phabs*bbodyrad model in the xspec package ) or an absorbed power law ( phabs*powerlaw model in the same package ) .",
    "the corresponding best - fit parameters are presented in table[tabspec ] together with measured fluxes and @xmath47 values .",
    "note that the former model describes the spectra slightly better .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the spectrum of s  there is a relatively low exponential cutoff at @xmath48 kev @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of this parameter in the model formally improves the fit and reduces the absorption value , but does not provide a better determination for the parameters due to the limited energy band of the instruments .",
    "it is shown in table [ tabspec ] that the spectral parameters ( e.g. , temperature and absorption ) are quite similar for all observations .",
    "the measured absorption value in the high state is in good agreement with the _ nustar _",
    "results @xcite and only slightly higher than the one of the galactic interstellar absorption in the direction of s , @xmath49 @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the absorption value in the low state is determined poorly due to insufficient statistics of the _ chandra _ data .",
    "the value varied from @xmath50 to @xmath51 @xmath25 depending on the spectral model , but due to large uncertainties it agrees with the interstellar value at the @xmath52 level .",
    "therefore , we fixed @xmath53 to the interstellar value and fitted only the temperature or power law index and corresponding normalization .",
    "note , that the fixing of @xmath53 at @xmath54 @xmath25 practically does not significantly change results of the approximation .",
    "the inclusion of an iron emission line did nt improve the goodness of the fit for the first xrt observation and only improved it insignificantly for the second .",
    "therefore , we obtain only upper limits ( @xmath55 ) for the iron line equivalent width in these observations : 116 and 390 ev , respectively ( the line energy and width were fixed at 6.4 and 0.1 kev ) .",
    "x - ray spectra of s  are shown in fig.[xspec ] along with best - fit models in the form of the absorbed black body emission .",
    "of particular interest is the observation with the _ chandra _ observatory , during which the source flux was almost 4 orders of magnitude lower than that near the peak of the outburst .",
    "observations of very faint x - ray transients can be used for testing different models of the neutron star cooling ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and its emission in the quiescent state .",
    "in particular , based on the spectral shape , it can be determined whether the source is still accreting at low level or whether the heated neutron star is observed .",
    "unfortunately , the statistics of the _ chandra _ observation are not sufficient to distinguish between thermal or non - thermal emission of s  in the low state ( table[tabspec ] ) .",
    "additionally , the temporal resolution of the acis instrument ( about 3.2 sec ) makes detection of the 9.3s spin period in s  very difficult , particularly with so few counts .",
    "in this paper we have used _",
    "chandra _ and _ swift_/xrt data to accurately determine the coordinates of the long known , but poorly studied , transient x - ray pulsar s  for the first time .    the subsequent optical observations with the _ salt _ telescope and a comprehensive analysis of the _ vvv _ survey data led to the identification of its likely infrared counterpart ,",
    "whose spectral energy distribution is consistent with a be - star , as expected from its previous classification as a bexrb with an accreting x - ray pulsar .",
    "moreover , a comparison of the measured sed with those of known be / x - ray binaries demonstrates the latter are similar and has allowed us to estimate the spectral type of the s  companion star as b1 - 2v and the distance to the system as @xmath0 kpc .",
    "this value agrees well with the independent estimations of @xmath56 kpc from the temporal properties of the pulsar @xcite .",
    "these distance estimates place s  in the scutum - centaurus arm , on the far side of the galaxy from the sun , or even further , depending on the possible spectral type of its companion star .",
    "this result can be considered as the first reliable distance determination to s  and , for an outlying galactic object , makes s  one of the most distant galactic high - mass x - ray binaries known .",
    "we note that estimations of distances to other distant galactic sources have , as a rule , quite large uncertainties and still require additional confirmations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in turn ,",
    "the determination of distances to high - mass x - ray binaries at the furthest regions of the galaxy , behind the galactic center , is very important for determining the space density of such objects @xcite .    the measurement of the distance to s  ( @xmath57 kpc ) has allowed us to estimate a lower limit to its unabsorbed luminosity near the outburst maximum as @xmath58  and in the faint state @xmath59 , from the _ swift_/xrt and _ chandra _ data , respectively .",
    "taking into account that the ratio between the x - ray bolometric source flux and its flux in the 0.5 - 10 kev energy band is about 2 ( from the analysis of the source broadband spectrum , obtained by _ nustar",
    "_ and our results , which demonstrate that its spectral shape is not dependent on the luminosity ) we can estimate a lower limit to the maximum ( bolometric ) x - ray luminosity of the source @xmath60 .",
    "the value @xmath61 , obtained for a distance of 20 kpc , is comparable with that measured for other bright be / x - ray binary transients such as v0332 + 53 and 4u0115 + 63 , and implies that the observed outbursts from s  are type ii in nature .",
    "the corresponding source luminosity in quiescence , namely @xmath62 is high enough for testing different models for the low accretion regime and neutron star cooling scenario , should one obtain sufficiently long exposures in the faint x - ray state .",
    "this research has made use of _ chandra _ data and software provided by the chandra x - ray center in the application package ciao .",
    "we also used of data supplied by the uk swift science data centre at the university of leicester .",
    "the optical observations were undertaken with salt directors discretionary time under programs 2014 - 2-ddt-004 , 2014 - 2-ddt-005 and 2015 - 1-ddt-004 , for which we are grateful .",
