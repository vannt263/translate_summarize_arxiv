    "the following problem was formulated by blint tth some 20 years ago with @xmath9 being the unit disc of the plane .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be convex bodies in @xmath2 , such that @xmath0 contains the origin , and define the process @xmath3 ,",
    "@xmath4 , as follows : let @xmath5 be a uniform random point in @xmath6 , and set @xmath7 . clearly , @xmath8 is a nested sequence of convex bodies which converge to a non - empty limit object , again a convex body in @xmath2 .",
    "what can we say about the distribution of this limit body ?",
    "what can we say about the speed of the process ?",
    "in figure [ fig:7gon ] one can see the evolution of the process up to @xmath10 on the right , and @xmath11 on the left , when @xmath12 is a regular heptagon .     the evolution of the process for @xmath9 being a regular heptagon ]    in @xcite ambrus , kevei and vgh investigated the process in @xmath13 dimension , when @xmath14 $ ] . in this case",
    "the limit object is a random unit interval , whose center has the arcsine distribution ( see theorem @xmath13 in @xcite ) .",
    "so even in the simplest case the process has very interesting features .",
    "moreover , in theorem @xmath15 in @xcite it is shown that if @xmath16 is the radius of the interval @xmath6 , then @xmath17 converges in distribution to a standard exponential random variable .",
    "the idea of the proof is to observe that @xmath18 behaves as the minimum of iid random variables , and thus obtain the limit theorem via extreme value theory .",
    "we also would like to point out the formal relationship between the diminishing process and the so called rnyi s parking problem from 1958 @xcite .",
    "rnyi studied the following random process : consider an interval @xmath19 of length @xmath20 , and sequentially and randomly pack ( non - overlapping ) unit intervals into @xmath19 . in each step",
    "we choose the center of the next unit interval uniformly from the possible space .",
    "the process stops when there is no space for placing a new unit interval .",
    "( intuitively @xmath19 is the parking lot and the unit intervals are the cars . ) the first possible question is to determine the expectation @xmath21 of the covered space .",
    "many other variants of this problem has been studied in the last more than 50 years , for an up - to - date state of the art we refer to clay and simnyi @xcite .",
    "the connection between the diminishing process and rnyi s parking problem can be seen easily as follows : if we choose in the definition of the diminishing process @xmath22 , and we drop the conditions we put on @xmath0 , and define @xmath0 as the complement of the closed interval of length @xmath15 centered at @xmath23 , then we get exactly rnyi s parking problem .    in the present paper",
    "we analyze the diminishing process in more general cases . in section [ sect:1dim ]",
    "we consider the case , when instead of choosing @xmath5 uniformly in the interval , we choose it according to a translated and scaled version of a fixed distribution @xmath24 .",
    "again , the limit object is a random unit interval . in theorem",
    "[ thm:1dim - rapid ] we determine the asymptotic behavior of the speed , while in theorem [ thm:1dim - center ] we show that for appropriate choice of @xmath24 the distribution of the center has the beta law . in sections [ sect : cube ] and [ sect : simplex ] we consider the case when @xmath12 is a cube and a regular @xmath25-dimensional simplex , respectively .",
    "the cube process can be represented as @xmath25 independent interval processes , thus the results in section [ sect : cube ] follow from the corresponding results in @xcite . in the case of the simplex process , the limit object is also a random regular simplex .",
    "the main result of this part is that the center of the limit simplex in barycentric coordinates has multidimensional dirichlet law , which is a natural generalization of the beta laws to any dimension .",
    "the rate of the process is also determined .",
    "the processes considered this far are ` self - similar ' in the sense that at each step the process is a scaled and translated version of the original one .    in sections",
    "[ sect:5 ] , [ sect : pentagon ] and [ sect : sok ] we consider diminishing processes in the plane . in case of the pentagon process even the shape of the limiting object is random .",
    "we prove that it is a pentagon with equal angles , however it is not regular a.s .",
    "this process is not ` self - similar ' , and its behavior is more complicated .",
    "we determine the rate of the convergence of the maximal height , but as the area of the limit object is random , limit theorem with deterministic normalization is not possible",
    ". also the behavior of the center of mass is intractable with our methods .",
    "finally , in section [ sect : sok ] we consider regular polygons with odd number of vertices , i.e.  @xmath26 is a regular polygon .",
    "using the theory of stochastic orderings for random vectors we prove that the rate of the speed is @xmath27 .",
    "we conjecture that in the case , when the number of vertices is even the speed of the process is @xmath28 .",
    "this is established in case of square , but in general it is open .",

    "this is the reason of the complication . )    in the next lemma we determine the asymptotic behavior of such sequence @xmath75 .",
    "the idea of the proof is to show that @xmath75 behaves like the minimum of @xmath85 iid random variables , as in the proof of theorem 1 in @xcite .",
