    "the study of classical dynamics in nonlinear media has proven to be a source of astonishing surprises over the last century .",
    "two observations , both based on numerical simulations , have challenged prejudices and fundamentally altered traditonal ways of thinking . first , the famous observation of fermi , pasta , ulam , and tsingou@xcite of a simple nonlinearly - coupled set of oscillators showing nontrivial recurrences , has shattered the long - held assumption that all nonlinear dynamical systems ergodically explore their full phase space .",
    "second , the pioneering numerical analysis of zabusky and kruskal @xcite on the korteweg - de vries equation @xcite demonstrated that this equation supports excitations , which they coined ` solitons ' , displaying a number of surprising fundamental features .",
    "the solitons are localized in space , with a form remaining stable under time evolution which sees them moving uniformly at a speed linearly proportional to their amplitude . additionally the astounding characteristic was observed of solitons emerging intact from mutual scattering processes , during which they simply `` ` pass through '' one other without losing their identity',@xcite the only effect of the collision being a relative spatial displacement as compared to their free propagation .",
    "the proper understanding of solitons in nonlinear media ultimately led to the development of the classical inverse scattering method , @xcite which is the overarching framework for classical integrable models .",
    "nonlinear classical systems find their quantum mechanical analogue in the shape of interacting many - body systems . in parallel to the classical case , some quantum models have been shown to be special , in the sense of being exactly solvable using the quantum version of the inverse scattering method @xcite ( one might also say integrable , though the quantum notion of integrability is not as well - defined as its classical counterpart @xcite ) .",
    "fundamental representatives of this family are the heisenberg spin chain , solved by bethe using what is now known as the bethe ansatz,@xcite along with the lieb - liniger model of @xmath0-interacting bosons on a line.@xcite for the latter , particle - like excitations called lieb type i modes @xcite exist due to the interparticle repulsion , along with type ii hole - like excitations visualized as holes in an effective fermi sea .",
    "it is possible to distinguish the presence of type i and ii modes in correlated bosonic gases in optical lattices using bragg spectroscopy.@xcite quantum magnets such as the heisenberg spin chain similarly carry particle - like magnon modes when the magnetization is close to saturation . in the limit of small magnetization",
    ", hole - like modes again appear , which in zero field are known as spinons.@xcite their dynamics can be experimentally observed using inelastic neutron scattering.@xcite the heisenberg chain supports distinct bound states of magnons , whose dynamics has been investigated theoretically@xcite and has recently been observed experimentally.@xcite    one could view such excitations as the quantum equivalents of classical solitons .",
    "this equivalence is however only partial : on the one hand , these quantum mechanical modes represent exact eigenstates and are stable under time evolution ; on the other hand , being exact eigenstates of translationally - invariant systems , they are not spatially localized .",
    "that said , as is usually the case in quantum mechanics , it is possible to adopt a ` complementary ' picture and create spatially localized excitations by forming wave packets of fundamental excitations by linearly combining states over a range of differing momenta .",
    "locality however comes at a price : the wave packet , mixing together states at different energies , will disperse and is thus not stable over long timescales , unlike its classical counterpart .",
    "we use the term quasisoliton for such a wave packet construction , an example of which was recently studied in the context of the lieb - liniger model,@xcite while their mutual scattering has been studied in quantum spin chains.@xcite    the spectroscopic methods traditionally employed to experimentally study condensed - matter systems typically provide momentum- and energy - resolved measurements . however , current experimental developments provide motivation to obtain a better theoretical understanding of spatially localized dynamics .",
    "time - resolved experiments are now able to track quantum many - body systems at timescales smaller than relaxation timescales , particularly in experiments with ultracold atoms,@xcite but also in nmr setups,@xcite and potentially in pump - probe spectroscopy experiments.@xcite as a result , non - dissipative dynamics of many - body systems out of equilibrium is now a rapidly growing field of experimental as well as theoretical investigation.@xcite novel cold - atom experimental techniques for spatially resolved manipulation and observation at the single - site level @xcite have opened the door to explicit high - resolution tracking of spatial propagation phenomena . moreover",

    "these excitations are often referred to as ` string states ' , as the rapidities describing bethe states containing such bound multi - magnons appear as approximately equally - spaced vertical strings in the complex plane ( the precise set of available bound states depends on the value of @xmath4 ; at the isotropic point @xmath12 and in the axial regime , all string lengths are allowed ) .",

    "<S> the quantum scattering of magnon bound states in the anisotropic heisenberg spin chain is shown to display features similar to the scattering of solitons in classical exactly solvable models . </S>",
    "<S> localized colliding gaussian wave packets of bound magnons are constructed from string solutions of the bethe equations and subsequently evolved in time , relying on an algebraic bethe ansatz based framework for the computation of local expectation values in real space - time . </S>",
    "<S> the local magnetization profile shows the trajectories of colliding wave packets of bound magnons , which obtain a spatial displacement upon scattering . </S>",
    "<S> analytic predictions on the displacements for various values of anisotropy and string lengths are derived from scattering theory and bethe ansatz phase shifts , matching time evolution fits on the displacements . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolved block decimation ( tebd ) algorithm allows for the study of scattering displacements from spin - block states , showing similar scattering displacement features . </S>"
