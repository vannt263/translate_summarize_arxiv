    "quantum plasmonics , the study of surface plasmons ( sps ) at the quantum level , is a promising framework for building new technological platforms at the nanoscale . as hybrid photon - electron states naturally confined at a metal - dielectric boundary ,  @xcite sps share fundamental properties of both their electronic and photonic faces  @xcite",
    "that are specifically modified in the quantum regime . from the electronic side first , confinement and hybridization can generate new cooperative electronic states between two or more metal particles ,  @xcite whereas in the contact plasmonic regime , the quantum nature of the electron cloud can come into play .",
    "@xcite this will impact on various applications such as surface enhanced raman scattering or non - linear optics that rely on a tight control over dimensions and distances .",
    "@xcite second , the quantum optical face of the sps , which is the main focus of the present paper , draws a promising avenue for quantum information processing or cryptography in 2d , despite intrinsic limitations due to the finite propagation length .",
    "the control over the particle - like part of the sps is a necessary prerequisite for quantum transfer of information , which could lead to secure information routing along metal nanowires as well as qubit entanglement mediated by sps .",
    "@xcite +    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     figure 4(c ) depicts the @xmath0 function recorded with the nv - based tip facing the gold side of the sample .",
    "no photon antibunching can be observed whatsoever .",
    "however , concluding from this deceptive result that the second - order correlation of the diamond tip would be lost after propagation along the plasmonic film would be erroneous .",
    "the real - space signal that is here analyzed includes a large incoherent signal mostly due to gold fluorescence that masks the coherence of the useful signal .",
    "this is confirmed by the spectral analysis of the involved signals .",
    "figure 5(a ) shows the spectrum recorded in the _ direct space _ for the nv - based tip placed in front of the fused silica substrate .",
    "clearly , this spectrum shows the usual nv@xmath1 ( i.e. negatively charged nv ) signature  @xcite which , in turn , is hardly distinguishable when the tip is facing the gold film , as shown in the _ direct - space _ image in figure 5(b ) . in this last configuration ,",
    "the detected signal is dominated by the gold fluorescence , which is also the reason for the intense central peak seen in the fourier space lrm images in figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) .",
    "in addition , the detection area in the direct space , shown as a small circle in figure 2(c ) , is too small to discriminate between the useful leaky sps and spurious photons . with the sp signal being delocalized over a large area ( see figure 2(c ) ) , i.e. , outside of the fiber detection zone , it is not possible to detect the nv fluorescence in this configuration , which is mainly coupled to leaky sps . + the above discussion appeals to working in the _ fourier space _ where spatial filtering can be applied to mitigate the spurious signals .",
    "adding an opaque disk of optimal extension in the back focal plane of the microscope masks almost entirely the allowed light , which has a non - plasmonic origin , whereas the forbidden plasmonic light is unaffected .",
    "this is confirmed by the filtered lrm image in fourier space shown in figure 2(d ) compared to the unfiltered image of figure 2(b ) .",
    "now , the detection area for spectral and photon - statistics analysis can be properly positioned on the sp circle to embrace the useful signal only .",
    "this is achieved by using a large - core ( 365 @xmath2 m ) multimode fiber indicated by the white circle in figure 2(d ) .",
    "the effect on the measured signal is dramatic as shown in figure 5(c ) : the nv spectral signature can be recognized , although it is slightly distorted compared to the original spectrum acquired in front of the silica substrate , possibly as a consequence of the wavelength variation in the coupling of the nvs with the sp modes",
    ".  @xcite + working in the fourier space places ourselves in a comfortable position to probe the correlation properties of the sp signal generated by the nv - based tip facing the gold film .",
    "the hbt correlator is fed with the spatially filtered signal previously analyzed in the spectral domain .",
    "the corresponding @xmath0 function , shown in figure 4(d ) , now clearly exhibits an antibunching dip . using the saturation curve shown in figure 4(a ) ( blue circles ) and repeating the same analysis as before",
    ", we obtain @xmath3 khz , @xmath4 mw and @xmath5 khz / mw ( see fit on figure 4(a ) ) . from @xmath6=0.15 and @xmath7",
    "we deduce @xmath8 just as before , when the tip was facing the silica substrate .",
    "this demonstrates that all five nv centers contribute to the sp signal and that the second - order coherence of the initial quantum source of light is not altered by the sp conversion into the gold film , despite the metal roughness .",
    "we also obtain @xmath9 ns@xmath10 which corresponds to a reduced lifetime @xmath11 ns . this marginal reduction in lifetime , which almost falls within the error bar  @xcite ,",
    "could be ascribed to the self - interaction of the quantum emitters close to the metal , i.e. due to a modification of the local density of states .",
    "@xcite + before concluding , it is worth stressing how powerful working in the fourier plane is .",
    "it has been shown that fourier filtering leads to strong image distortions in the direct space .",
    "@xcite therefore , working in the direct space as shown in figure 2(c ) , but with the fourier filter in place , would artificially reduce the depth of the antibunching dip , thereby precluding to conclude about the exact number of contributing nvs .",
    "this complication is avoided by working directly in the fourier space .",
    "to summarize , we have demonstrated for the first time non - classical second - order antibunching @xmath12 through a 2d plasmonic channel .",
    "this phenomenon is the quantum counterpart of spontaneous emission in a 2d plasmonic environment . within this context",
    ", lrm plays a major role since it allows for monitoring both the wave - like and particle - like features of quantum sps emitted by nv centers , thereby highlighting the fundamental wave - particle dualism of quantum plasmons .",
    "the high first - order spatial coherence of sps observed both in the direct and fourier spaces is a direct signature of their wave - like nature .",
    "we plan in the future to study more directly these coherence effects in double - slit - like interference experiments involving sps and nds .",
    "+ finally , the second - order correlation properties of the initial quantum source of light are found to be preserved after sp propagation along a plain film . as a rewarding consequence ,",
    "it is possible to envision designing lithographically fabricated plasmonic devices for future quantum information processing or cryptography at the nanoscale .",
    "the unique potentialities offered by a nsom system to position very accurately a quantum emitter in a complex plasmonic environment will be in this context a precious advantage to study how this environment modifies both the first- and second - order coherence of the locally emitted photons .",
    "+    we are grateful to guillaume bachelier and james hulse for helpful discussions and a critical reading of the manuscript , and to jean - francois motte for the optical tip manufacturing .",
