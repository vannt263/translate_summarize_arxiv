    "deviation of a transresistance dependence from this usual one can reveal existence of new broken symmetry phases or strong interlayer correlations in a bilayer .    in a system of spatially separated electrons and holes the coulomb attraction between them can lead to electron - hole cooper pairing@xcite .",
    "it has been predicted in a semiconductor heterostructure@xcite in graphene double layer system@xcite and in thin film of topological insulator@xcite .",
    "electron - hole cooper pairing can lead to superfluidity @xcite , nonlocal andreev reflection @xcite , internal josephson effect @xcite and to strong coulomb drag effect@xcite .",

    "the later is important and influences both drag in weak coupling regime@xcite and fluctuational drag in vicinity of the critical temperature .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the section 2",
    "we briefly discuss the model .",

    "we do not specify explicitly the interaction hamiltonian with disorder .",
    "since components of a cooper pair are spatially separated and have opposite charge both short - range disorder and long - range coulomb impurities lead to the pairbreaking and can suppress cooper pairing .",

    "the result of competition is different and total fluctuational contribution can have as positive , as negative sign",
    ". moreover the number of different regimes can be realized experimentally .",

    "the calculated al contribution to transconductivity is universal .",
    "it depends only on parameters of cooper propagator and does not depend explicitly on electron and hole single - particle spectrum .",
    "hence we conclude that our theory is well applicable for other realizations of electron - hole bilayer including semiconductor bilayer and double layer graphene structure .",
    "recently anomalous increasing of transresistance with decreasing of temperature has been measured in semiconductor heterostructure with spatially separated electrons and holes@xcite .",
    "hence at low temperatures electrons and holes in that system do not behave as weakly - coupled fermi liquids .",
    "measured temperature dependence of transresistance contradicts with the predicted@xcite and experimentalists have tried to interpret the effect as manifestation of the cooper pair fluctuations .",
    "the anomalous dependence has been measured in low - density regime and is not sensitive to concentration mismatch of electrons and holes .",

    "quantitative theory of the fluctuational drag effect in that regime is interesting and challenging problem . in that system cooper pairing",
