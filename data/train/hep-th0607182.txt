    "recently , a long - standing problem or puzzle @xcite in any relativistic quantum field theories has been investigated by the present authors @xcite .",
    "the problem is how to construct the negative energy sea , or dirac sea for bosons , since as is well known the fermion fields was historically second quantized firstly by dirac in terms of dirac sea and hole theory @xcite . in the fermion case there",
    "exists pauli s exclusion principle and easily negative energy sea , namely , the dirac sea is constructed . in the bosonic cases contrary to fermions , one might think at first that it would be impossible to construct such a sea due to lack of the pauli principle , so that infinite number of bosons at each energy state could exist and thus the negative energy states could never be filled .",
    "however , we succeeded in constructing the dirac sea for bosons , so called _ boson sea_. in fact , there we solved one of the serious problems : how to construct the positive definite norm of the negative energy states .",
    "there we have used a non - local definition ( the detail of the methods see @xcite ) .",
    "it is the purpose of the present article to show another method employing the regularization of the naively divergent inner product in the negative number sector and the renormalization .",
    "in fact we make use of a kind of @xmath0-regularization method to make it finite , and then make renormalization by discarding all the divergent terms , which can be done successfully .",
    "the advantage of this @xmath0-method is to make transparent the analytic structure of the whole procedure .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in the following section 2 we treat the inner product by @xmath0-regularization and renormalization , and the positive definite inner product is obtained . in section 3",
    "we verify the orthonormality of our inner product obtained in section 2 by performing some explicit analytic calculation . in section 4 we present another definition of the inner product without the subtraction scheme in the renormalization , and we give a proof of the orthonormality .",
    "section 5 is devoted to conclusion and further perspectives .",
    "as a preparation to define the inner product , we define an @xmath9-regularized inner product as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the integral region , and @xmath12 is a regularization function .",
    "the integral region @xmath13 is just the inside of the light - cone shown as the shaded zone in fig .",
    "[ gamma ] .     on @xmath14-plane .",
    "the exponential factor @xmath15 converges in this region . ]    the @xmath9-regularized inner product ( [ pre - gamma - product ] ) is divergent for @xmath16 , and it is divided into the following three parts : @xmath17 by the behavior of @xmath16 . the first term @xmath18 diverges for @xmath16 .",
    "according to the precise calculation presented in the next section , the concrete form of @xmath18 is given by the linear combination of @xmath19 for positive integer n. thus we can manifestly separate the second term @xmath20 which is just independent term of @xmath9 for @xmath16 .",
    "the third term @xmath21 goes to zero for @xmath16 .",
    "we define the inner product by a renormalization of the @xmath9-regularized inner product : @xmath22 which may be so called the minimal subtraction scheme of the renormalization .",
    "we can confirm the inner product ( [ gamma - product ] ) satisfies the orthonormal condition : @xmath23 the product ( [ gamma - product ] ) is just positive definite even for the indefinite metric of @xmath24-algebra , namely , @xmath25 .",
    "therefore we construct the hilbert space including the negative number sector by using the product ( [ gamma - product ] ) .",
    "these are the result from the combination of the @xmath13-restriction , the regularization function @xmath26 and the renormalization .    in the definition of the inner product ( [ gamma - product ] ) , the restriction of the integral region into @xmath13 and the regularization function @xmath26 are quite important .",
    "the restriction of the integral region into @xmath13 is a part of the regularization which is nothing but a kind of hard cut - off .",
    "the choice of the integral region @xmath13 is important to realize the orthogonal condition .",
    "we hereby verify the orthonormality ( [ ortho - normal - condition ] ) of the inner product ( [ gamma - product ] ) . we introduce a hyperbolic coordinate @xmath27 on the @xmath14-plane for convenience .",
    "the hyperbolic coordinate @xmath27 on the @xmath14-plane is defined as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 covers the whole region @xmath13 as shown in fig .",
    "[ hyperbola ] .     for fixed @xmath31 .",
    "]    this hyperbolic coordinate respects the lorentz invariance of the hamiltonian and the `` gaussian '' factor @xmath15 ( see our previous paper @xcite ) .",
    "the relation between the differential operators is given by @xmath32      \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y }      \\end{array }      \\right )      & = &      \\left (      \\begin{array}{cc }      + \\cosh\\theta & -\\frac{1}{r}\\sinh\\theta\\\\[0.5em ]      -\\sinh\\theta & + \\frac{1}{r}\\cosh\\theta      \\end{array }      \\right )      \\left (      \\begin{array}{c }          \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\\\[0.5em ]      \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta }      \\end{array }      \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the relation between integral measures becomes @xmath33    as the first step of the proof , we concretely calculate several inner products and norms of the states .    the most important is the vacuum norm .",
    "the @xmath9-regularized product ( [ pre - gamma - product ] ) of the vacuum becomes @xmath34 then we obtain @xmath35 , because there arises no divergent part in ( [ pre - vacuum - norm ] ) and the @xmath9-independent part of ( [ pre - vacuum - norm ] ) is @xmath36 as @xmath37 .",
    "we also calculate a product of the orthogonal states @xmath38 in this case , the orthogonal relation is realized without any regularization .",
    "one of the non - trivial cases is @xmath39 thus the renormalized product defined in ( [ gamma - product ] ) becomes @xmath40 , because there appears no @xmath9-independent term rather than the divergent term .",
    "more important case is the following : @xmath41 where we have used the calculation steps ( [ pre - vacuum - norm ] ) and ( [ pre-02-norm ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath42 .",
    "we have the positive value of this product even for the negative norm of the @xmath43-element .    as the second step of the proof , we derive recurrence formulae for the @xmath9-regularized inner product . for any wave - functions @xmath44 and @xmath45 , we have the following relations :    @xmath46_\\varepsilon    \\;+\\ ;    2 \\varepsilon    \\langle { f } \\:| x |\\ : { g } \\rangle_\\varepsilon ,    \\label{dif - x }    \\\\",

    "the left - hand side of ( [ linear - combination - x ] ) consists of @xmath9-divergent terms and contains no @xmath9-independent terms , so that we conclude that the surface term in ( [ level - x ] ) never contribute to the renormalized inner product defined in ( [ gamma - product ] ) .",
    "the surface term in ( [ level - y ] ) has the same @xmath9-behavior as that in ( [ level - x ] ) , because the surface term @xmath68_\\varepsilon $ ] is obtained by a linear combination of the functions @xmath64 , and we have a relation @xmath69_\\varepsilon    & = &    \\frac{2}{-\\log\\varepsilon }    \\ :    \\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)^{\\frac{a+b+1}{2 } }    \\ : \\times    \\left\\ {     \\begin{array}{ll }       1 & ( a=0,\\ b=1)\\\\       \\frac{a+b-1}{2}\\gamma\\left(\\frac{a+b-1}{2}\\right )         & ( a:{\\rm even},\\ b:{\\rm odd})\\\\       0 & ( { \\rm others } )     \\end{array }    \\right .. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus the surface term in ( [ level - y ] ) has no contribution to the renormalized inner product ( [ gamma - product ] ) .",

    "never contribute to the renormalized inner product ( [ gamma - product ] ) .",
    "finally the recurrence formulae ( [ level - x ] ) and ( [ level - y ] ) tell us that @xmath9-regularized inner product ( [ pre - gamma - product ] ) has the property : @xmath71 and we conclude that the renormalized inner product ( [ gamma - product ] ) satisfies the orthonormal condition : @xmath72",
    "one may consider that the separation of the divergent part in ( [ separation ] ) has ambiguity and the definition of the renormalization ( [ gamma - product ] ) is also ambiguous .",
    "as we have seen in the proof in the section 3 , there is no ambiguity because the structure of the divergent part is completely understood . in this section ,",
    "we present another definition of the inner product which obviously has no ambiguity because the subtraction scheme is not employed .",
    "we extend the regularization parameter @xmath9 in ( [ pre - gamma - product ] ) from real value to complex one .",
    "the definition of the inner product is @xmath73 ,   \\label{holomorphic - product}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced the parameterization of @xmath9 as @xmath74 namely , the positive parameter @xmath75 is the absolute value , and the real parameter @xmath76 is the phase .",
    "the limit of the phase @xmath76 in ( [ holomorphic - product ] ) is continuously taken according to the path @xmath77 the absolute value @xmath75 should be always smaller than 1 in the limit .",

    "therefor we find that the vacuum norm ( [ vacuum - norm-2a ] ) becomes unity as @xmath85     \\nonumber \\\\    & = &     1 .",
    "\\label{vacuum - norm-2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    according to the argument in the previous section , the ( @xmath9-divergent part ) in ( [ resultant - separation ] ) consists of the terms in ( [ epsilon - dependence ] ) , and the ( @xmath9-zero pert ) consists of the terms @xmath86 by taking the limit according to the path ( [ phi_path ] ) , the factor @xmath87 in the ( @xmath9-divergent part ) and in the ( @xmath9-zero pert ) has no additional contribution because @xmath88 is a integer , and the only logarithm in the denominator produces the additional phase factor @xmath89 .",

    "we have found that the ( @xmath9-divergent part ) and the ( @xmath9-zero pert ) vanish in the limit of @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , the inner product defined in ( [ holomorphic - product ] ) results the orthonormal relation : @xmath91     \\nonumber\\\\    & = &    \\delta_{n_+,n_+ ' }    \\delta_{m_-,m_-'}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "we have proposed the other definitions of the positive definite inner product for the negative number sector of the double harmonic oscillator than the non - local method in the previous paper @xcite .",
    "the new definitions provide positive definite inner product , and there arises no difference of results among the definitions .    the separation of @xmath20 from @xmath18 in ( [ separation ] ) has been succeeded , because we have known the form of @xmath18 by the concrete calculation .",
    "one may consider that the separation in ( [ separation ] ) may seem to be ambiguous , however , we have found that the anxiety of the ambiguity is completely solved by the holomorphic definition ( [ holomorphic - product ] ) .",
    "this means that there arises no ambiguity in the perturbation theories , because the perturbation theories never deform the harmonic oscillators in the mode expansion of the fields .",
    "when we consider the non - perturbative phenomena , i.g .",
    ", quantum anomalies in external fields , the ambiguity may arises and results the non - trivial effects .",
    "this is the further subject to investigate .",
