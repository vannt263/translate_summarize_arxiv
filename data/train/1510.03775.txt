    "although the average temperature does not reach the melting point , local amorphization at the interface is evident in the @xmath75ps configuration .",
    "the recovery is rapid and takes place via nucleation and growth of high pressure @xmath78 shockley partials and their loops at multiple disordered sites at the interface .",

    "it reaches a maximum at the plastic front , stabilizes within the elastic precusor and then discontinuously decreases at the elastic front . within the plastic zone ,",

    "the stress distribution is unlike that observed in bulk shockwaves in that the discontinuous decrease in the pressure and the corresponding rapid increase in the shear stress at the plastic front are both absent  @xcite .",
    "the variations are directly attributable to interfacial plasticity and the associated relaxation processes .",
    "in particular , the profile is modified by partial dislocations that nucleate at the interface and expand into the bulk .",
    "these events delay the onset of the plastic zone , resulting in decrease in dislocation density away from the interface compared to that in the bulk studies , eventually leading to a modified stress profile at the plastic wave front .    in some cases , especially during early stages of the impact , there is a rapid decrease in the shear stress over a few interatomic spacings away from the interface region .",
    "this is evident in the @xmath90ps profile in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure6]a . to see why , note that the nucleation of the partials from the interface region following impact increases the dislocation content at the interface as the burgers vector of the entire bicrystal system must be conserved . as an example , the interface configuration in figure  [ fig : figure4]b-4 consists of remnants of the trailing partials following dislocation nucleation at multiple interfacial sites .",
    "the large strain accommodation occurs preferentially in the plane of the defective interface , and elevates the shear stress compared to that in the crystalline surrounding bulk .",

    "[ fig : figure7]a ) , the interface structure is stable with no point or extended defects , i.e. the interface is able to absorb the entire impact elastically and the velocity is sub - critical .    systematically increasing the impact velocity yields the critical point associated with incipient plasticity , @xmath95 m/s .",
    "this value is well above that for the commensurate response , yet the extent of plasticity is much higher , evident from the rapid increase in the number density of hcp atoms at @xmath95 m/s ( fig .",

    "]    although the four slip planes have the same sf@xmath96 , the fact that they are not activated simultaneously indicates that the interface structure plays a crucial role in setting the competition between the slip planes .",
    "past studies have shown that structure and distribution of morphological features such as kinks and steps at the grain boundaries can lead to dissociation of grain boundary dislocations ( gbds ) along preferred directions into the adjoining crystals  @xcite . in some cases , the dissociation can occur along low sf planes .",
    "the subsequent plasticity is then biased by the presence of these dissociated dislocations .",
    "for example , dislocation nucleation from the boundary usually increases its dislocation content .",
    "however , if the stress accommodation occurs via growth of the pre - dissociated dislocations , the reverse is true as the boundary loses part of the dissociated dislocation . in the case of [ 001 ] tgbs studied here , the boundary is composed of screw dislocations and steps that are sensitive to the degree of incommensuration or twist misorientation , and the boundary inclination is singular  @xcite .",
    "the structural features will modify the nucleation of the leading shockley partials along preferred planes .",
    "we should emphasize that in the case of high velocity impact , the processes occur within a tgb structure that is itself in the process of attaining its equilibrium structure , a combined effect of an elevated stress state and temperature .",
    "although the evolving interfacial structure is still expected to modify the mechanistic details of dislocation nucleation , they will naturally be modified compared to the response of an equilibrated grain boundary .",
    "for example , the unaxially compressed state following release of the shockwaves can suppress the dissociation of grain boundary dislocations .",
    "the fact that the growth of the leading partials occurs along high sf close - packed planes is suggestive that this is the case . as additional confirmation , in time the accumulation of dislocation content within the tgb results in structural breakdown ( fig .",
