    "when there are inelastic interactions among particles , the behavior of collections of particles is completely different from that of elastic particles : there are no equilibrium states and any spatially homogeneous states are no longer stable . such a collection of the particles having inelastic interactions is called the granular gas whose physical realization can be observed in rings of planets , small planets , suspended particles in fluidized beds , aerosols , and rapid granular flows _",
