    "a symmetric determinantal representation ( sdr ) of a polynomial @xmath5 $ ] is a symmetric matrix @xmath2 with entries in @xmath6 such that @xmath7 .",
    "one can also find in the literature other definitions where for instance the symmetric matrix has linear ( degree-@xmath8 ) polynomials as entries .",
    "the two definitions are essentially equivalent , and we shall see that for our purposes , taking one or the other does not make any difference .",
    "symmetric determinantal representations have been studied at least from the beginning of the twentieth century  @xcite and apparently even from the nineteenth century  @xcite .",
    "definite sdrs are sdrs with the additional requirement that the matrix obtained by setting all the variables to zero is positive semi - definite .",
    "definite sdrs play an important role in convex optimization , leading to a renew of interest in these representations , definite or not , in the recent years  @xcite , see also @xcite and the presentation  @xcite for more perspectives on this .",
    "recently , petter brndn has given sdrs for the elementary symmetric polynomials  @xcite .",
    "he uses at this end graph - theoretic constructions and considers the laplacian matrix of the graph .",
    "our constructions are also graph - theoretic but we consider the adjacency matrix of the graphs we obtain .",
    "independently , symmetric determinants in characteristic two have also been a subject of studies  @xcite .",
    "symmetric determinantal representations for polynomials represented by weakly - skew circuits were given in @xcite for any field of characteristic different from @xmath0 .",
    "the authors conjectured that these representations do not always exist in characteristic @xmath0 .",
    "we prove this fact in this paper . to this end",
    ", we give a necessary condition for a polynomial to admit an sdr .",
    "we then focus on multilinear polynomials . for these polynomials",
    ", we show an equivalence between the existence of an sdr and the ability to factorize the polynomial in certain quotient rings .",
    "we develop algorithms to study the factorization in these quotient rings .",
    "altogether , we obtain polynomial - time algorithms to factorize polynomials in the quotient rings and to compute sdrs of multilinear polynomials when they exist .",
    "a polynomial @xmath5 $ ] is said _",
    "representable _ if it has an sdr , that is if there exists a symmetric matrix @xmath2 with entries in @xmath6 such that @xmath3 . in this case",
    ", we say that @xmath2 _ represents _ @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , the polynomial @xmath9 is representable as the determinant of the @xmath10 matrix @xmath11    note that we ask the matrix to have entries in @xmath4 .",
    "a natural relaxation would be to allow entries in an extension @xmath12 of @xmath4 .",
    "actually , we shall show along the way that at least for multilinear polynomials , and most certainly for any polynomial , this relaxation is irrelevant . in the case of multilinear polynomials ,",
    "corollary  [ cor : basefield ] shows that if a polynomial is representable , it has an sdr which only uses elements from the field generated by its coefficients .",
    "* organization . *",
    "we begin by introducing some relevant algebraic background in section  [ sec : background ] .",
    "section  [ sec : representable ] is devoted to prove that sdrs exist for a large class of polynomials .",
    "then section  [ sec : obstructions ] proves the main results of this paper : some polynomials are not representable , and we can characterize the multilinear representable polynomials .",
    "some partial results towards a full characterization are also given .",
    "section  [ sec : factor ] is devoted to more algorithmic results . using the equivalence between representability and factorizability in certain quotient rings , we develop algorithms for these two tasks .",
    "section  [ sec : alternating ] is devoted to the case of alternating determinantal representations in any characteristic . finally , we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] by some remaining open questions .",
    "experimentations were done using the free open - source mathematics software system _ sage _ @xcite , they allowed in return to fix a bug in its determinant method ( ticket # 10063 ) .",
    "the algorithms presented in this paper have been implemented and are available at http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/bruno.grenet/publis/symdetreprchar2.sage .",
    "let us introduce some useful notions and notations .",
    "let @xmath4 be any field of characteristic @xmath0 , and let @xmath13 $ ] be the ring of polynomials in @xmath14 indeterminates over @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath15 , then the _ primitive monomial _",
    "@xmath16 is defined by @xmath17 .",
    "a _ monomial _ is a polynomial of the form @xmath18 for some @xmath19 and some primitive monomial @xmath16 .",
    "the constant @xmath20 is its _ coefficient _ , and @xmath16 is its _ primitive part_. the value @xmath21 is its _ total degree _ and @xmath22 is its degree _ with respect to the variable @xmath23_. a polynomial is said to be _ multilinear _ if its monomials @xmath24 satisfy @xmath25 for all @xmath26 .    working in characteristic @xmath0 causes some inconveniences , like the impossibility to halve .",
    "but , it also simplifies some computations .",
    "first , frobenius endomorphism ensures that for any polynomials @xmath27 and @xmath28 , we have @xmath29 .",
    "second , the determinant can easily be computed :    [ prop : detchar2 ] the determinant of an @xmath30 symmetric matrix with entries in @xmath31 $ ] is @xmath32 where @xmath33 ranges over all involutions from @xmath34 to itself , that is permutations such that @xmath35 .",
    "the definition of the determinant is @xmath36 where @xmath33 ranges over all permutations of @xmath34 .",
    "actually , the signature of a permutation is either @xmath8 or @xmath37 , and those two elements coincide in characteristic @xmath0 .",
    "this means that the signature can be removed from the definition .",
    "consider @xmath38 for some permutation such that @xmath39 .",
    "then , @xmath40 as @xmath2 is symmetric , and @xmath41 . thus the products for a permutation and its inverse cancel out in the sum .",
    "this shows that the sum can be restricted to involutions .",
    "given some polynomials @xmath42 , we denote by @xmath43 the ideal they generate .",
    "that is , @xmath44\\right\\}.\\ ] ] given a tuple @xmath45 , we define the ideal @xmath46 we also define the quotient ring @xmath47 as @xmath13/{\\mathcal{i}}(\\ell)$ ] and denote by @xmath48 or @xmath49 the canonical projection @xmath13\\to{\\mathcal{r}}(\\ell)$ ] .",
    "the restriction of this projection to @xmath4 is one - to - one , hence @xmath4 naturally embeds into @xmath47 , and the elements of @xmath50 are called _ constants_. this morphism of rings can be extended to matrices by @xmath51 , and commutes with the determinant : @xmath52 .",
    "an element of @xmath47 is said to be _ linear _ if it is the projection of a linear polynomial .",
    "since the quotient identifies the squares of variables with constants , any element of @xmath53 has a unique multilinear representative in @xmath5 $ ] : we denote it by @xmath54 or @xmath55 .",
    "we have @xmath56 .",
    "we denote by @xmath57 or @xmath58 the map @xmath59 that sends a polynomial to the multilinear polynomial obtained by replacing each factor @xmath60 by @xmath61 . for instance , let @xmath62 then @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the square of any element of @xmath47 belongs to @xmath4 . in particular ,",
    "an element of @xmath47 is invertible if , and only if , its square is not zero .",
    "for example , @xmath65 is invertible if , and only if , @xmath66 .    given a tuple @xmath45 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath67 the tuple @xmath68 and say that @xmath67 is a _ tuple of squares_. if @xmath67 is a tuple of squares , the square of an element @xmath69 of @xmath70 is the square of a unique element @xmath20 of @xmath4 : we denote it by @xmath71 or @xmath72 , and call it the _ absolute value _ of @xmath69 .",
    "we remark that @xmath73 and @xmath74 for all @xmath75 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath69 is invertible if , and only if , @xmath76 .",
    "we deal with some positive results .",
    "even though the main part of this paper is focused on negative results , we need to be able to represent some class of polynomials in order to give a characterization .    in order to clarify some proofs , we will use the correspondence between permanents and cycle covers in graphs .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for the definitions concerning graphs .",
    "let @xmath77 be a weighted digraph and @xmath2 its adjacency matrix .",
    "we assume that the weights of @xmath77 are elements of @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "a _ cycle _ is a set of distinct arcs @xmath78 such that all the @xmath79 s are distinct but @xmath80 .",
    "cycle cover _ of @xmath77 is a set of disjoint cycles such that each vertex of the digraph belongs to exactly one cycle .",
    "the _ weight _ of a cycle cover is the product of the weights of all the arcs it uses .",
    "it is easily seen from the definition that the permanent of @xmath2 equals the sum of the weights of all the cycle covers of @xmath77 .",
    "since the characteristic of @xmath4 is two , the permanent of @xmath2 equals its determinant .",
    "suppose now that @xmath77 is symmetric ( that is @xmath2 is symmetric ) .",
    "proposition [ prop : detchar2 ] shows that only some special cases of cycle covers can be considered .",
    "more precisely , the determinant of @xmath2 equals the sum of the weights of the cycle covers of @xmath77 corresponding to an involution .",
    "these cycle covers are made of length-@xmath8 and length-@xmath0 cycles , and are called _ partial matchings_.    as @xmath77 is symmetric , it can actually be considered as an undirected graph .",
    "length-@xmath8 cycles are _ loops _ , and length-@xmath0 cycles are _",
    "edges_. the weight of a length-@xmath0 cycle is the product of the weights of its arcs , that is the square of the weight of the edge . thus consider a partial matching of a graph @xmath77 with ( symmetric ) adjacency matrix @xmath2 .",
    "it can be viewed as a set @xmath81 of edges such that no vertex belongs to two distinct edges .",
    "the discussion is summarized by the identity @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 represent the weights of an edge @xmath85 and of a loop on a vertex @xmath86 respectively , @xmath87 means that the vertex @xmath86 is not covered by @xmath81 , and @xmath81 ranges over all partial matchings of @xmath77 .",
