    "a stent is a mesh tube that is inserted into a natural conduit of the body to prevent or counteract a disease - induced localized flow constriction .",
    "for instance , to keep the arteries open , a stent is inserted at the location of the narrowing .",
    "performance of coronary stents depends on the mechanical properties of the material the stent is made of and on the geometrical properties of a stent , e.g. , number of stent struts , their length , their placement , the strut width and thickness , geometry of the cross section of each stent strut , etc . as a consequence",
    "the behavior of the stents is very complex and reliable models are desirable .",
    "since the stents are usually made of metals we consider a stent to be a three - dimensional elastic body defined as a union of three - dimensional struts .",
    "if the deformations in the problem are small behavior of stents can be modeled by the linearized elasticity .",
    "the equations of linearized elasticity in thin domains are very demanding for numerical approximation and qualitative analysis .",
    "therefore , it is appealing to construct a more simple analytical approximation . the one - dimensional model of stents",
    "was first considered in @xcite and then reformulated in @xcite as a system of ordinary differential equations given on the graph defined by the middle curves of the stent struts .",
    "the model is one - dimensional in a sense that it is given by the ordinary differential equations with respect to the natural parameter of the middle curves of the struts as the variable ( arc - length variable ) .",
    "however the model describes full three - dimensional behavior of the stent .",
    "thus , each stent strut is modeled using the curved rod model ( see @xcite for the rigorous derivation of the model from three - dimensional elasticity ) and a set of transmission conditions at joints ( vertices of the graph ) describing : continuity of displacement and rotation and equilibrium of forces and couples .",
    "note that the model is not restricted to stents but can be used to model behavior of any elastic structure made of elastic bodies which are thin in two directions ( rod  like ) .",
    "the function space on which the stent model is posed in the weak formulation , includes conditions of inextensibility and ushearability of rods that model struts .",
    "therefore to build a finite element approximation within this function space ( @xmath0 in section  [ sstent ] ) one needs to fulfill these restrictions with each finite element functions .",
    "however this is not a simple task .",
    "the associated mixed formulation removes the conditions from the function space using the lagrange multipliers .",
    "these conditions then become adjoined equations .",
    "when the stent is considered solely with no interaction with surrounding , natural boundary conditions are of the neumann type , i.e. , contact forces are prescribed . as usual",
    "associated to this pure traction problems are two qualitative properties , a necessary condition for the existence ( total force and moment are zero , see ( [ necessary ] ) ) and nonuniqueness of the solution of the problem ( up to an infinitesimal rigid deformation , see ( [ uniqueness ] ) ) .",
    "we remove both notions by fixing the total displacement and total infinitesimal rotation in ( [ uniqueness ] ) .",
    "this adds two more equations in the mixed formulation ( and two more lagrange multipliers which are in @xmath1 ) .",
    "the main tool to obtain the equivalence of the classical weak ( variational ) formulation and the mixed formulation is the babuska - brezzi condition , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  4.1 and corollary 4.1 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem ii.1.1 ) . to obtain it we use techniques applied in @xcite and @xcite for solving a particular problem on the same graph prescribed by the stent , but for simplified constitutive law , zero forces and prescribed non - zero extension and shear of the cross  section .",
    "the solution is obtained by explicitly integrating problems on struts , and then incorporating the solution , with respect to the topology of the graph , into a big algebraic system .",
    "the numerical analysis of the discretization together with a description of an implementation of the method will be presented in @xcite .    in section  [ s2 ]",
    "we start with the problem on a single curved rod and the formulation of its mixed formulation to introduce the problem and present the ideas .",
    "then , in section  [ s3 ] we formulate the stent model , recall the @xmath2 space on the graph , and prove the poincar type inequality for this space . using this estimate",
    "we prove the ellipticity of the stiffness form on the space that includes inextensibility and unshearability of rods .",
    "finally we prove the babuska - brezzi @xmath3 condition for the stent structure in lemma  [ infsup ] which then gives the equivalence of the formulations .",
    "a three - dimensional elastic body with its two dimensions small comparing to the third is generally called an elastic rod , see figure  [ strut ] .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    a curved rod model is a one - dimensional approximation of a `` thin '' three - dimensional curved elastic structure given in terms of the arc - length of the middle curve of the rod as an unknown variable .",
    "thus in order to build the model a natural parametrization @xmath4 \\to \\zr^3 $ ] of the middle curve of the curved rod ( red in figure  [ strut ] ) has to be given .",
    "further , let the cross - section of a rod be rectangular , of width @xmath5 in direction of the binormal @xmath6 on the middle curve and thickness @xmath7 in direction of the normal @xmath8 on the middle curve .",
    "one - dimensional equilibrium model for curved elastic rods we use here is given by the following first order system .",
    "for a given force with line density @xmath9 the model is expressed in terms of @xmath10 that satisfy @xmath11 together with associated boundary condition .",
    "here , @xmath12 is the displacement of the middle curve , @xmath13 is the vector of the infinitesimal rotation of the cross - sections , @xmath14 is the contact couple and @xmath8 is the contact force .",
    "the first two equations describe the balance of contact force and contact moment , respectively , while the last two equations describe the constitutive relation for a curved , linearly elastic rod .",
    "the last equation can be interpreted as the condition of inextensibility and unshearability of the rod .",
    "the matrices @xmath15 and @xmath16 are given by @xmath17 , \\qquad { { \\bf q}}= \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc } { \\vec{t } } & { \\vec{n } } & \\b\\end{array}\\right]\\ ] ] see e.g. @xcite . here",
    "@xmath18 is the youngs modulus of the material ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the lam constants ) , @xmath21 are the moments of inertia of the cross - sections and @xmath22 is the torsion rigidity of the cross - sections .",
    "therefore , @xmath15 describes the elastic properties of the material the rods ( struts ) are made of and the geometry of the cross - sections .",
    "this model is linearization of the antman - cosserat model for inextensible , unshearable rods , see @xcite for the nonlinear model and @xcite for the linearization .",
    "the model can also be seen as a linearization of the nonlinear model derived by scardia in @xcite from three - dimensional nonlinear elasticity .",
    "it was show in @xcite and @xcite that the solution of the one - dimensional model can be obtained as a limit of solutions of equilibrium equations of three - dimensional elasticity when thickness of the cross - sections ( both , @xmath5 and @xmath7 ) tend to zero .",
    "corresponding result for the dynamic case is given in @xcite .",
    "therefore , for three - dimensional rods which are thin enough one - dimensional curved rod model can provide well enough approximation .",
    "moreover , in @xcite , it was shown that curved geometry can be approximated with a piecewise straight geometry with an error estimate .",
    "this will further simplify the equations of the one - dimensional model .      to obtain classical existence and uniqueness result one classically rewrites the problem in the weak / variational formulation . in the weak formulation inextensibility and unshearability conditions",
    "are incorporated in the function space which complicates the numerical approximation of the problem . therefore the mixed formulation of ( [ lj1r])-([lj4r ] ) is called for .",
    "let us take @xmath23 and multiply ( [ lj1r ] ) by @xmath24 and ( [ lj2r ] ) by @xmath25 and sum the equations and integrate them over @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "we obtain @xmath27 after partial integration in the first and the third term on the right hand side we obtain @xmath28 inserting @xmath14 from ( [ lj3r ] ) we obtain @xmath29 finally from ( [ lj4r ] ) for all @xmath30 we obtain @xmath31 let us define function spaces @xmath32 , @xmath33 , bilinear forms @xmath34and the linear functional @xmath35 now the mixed formulation of the one rod problem ( [ lj1r])-([lj4r ] ) is given by : find @xmath36 such that @xmath37    for a single rod , the boundary conditions at @xmath38 need to be prescribed . at this point",
    "we assume ( the most difficult case ) that the rod is clamped at @xmath39 and @xmath40 , i.e. , @xmath41 therefore we define the function space containing these boundary conditions , namely @xmath42 now the mixed formulation is given by : find @xmath43 such that @xmath44    [ rjunction]_for the stent problem , the boundary conditions will be given by the kinematic and dynamic contact conditions .",
    "they consist of continuity of displacement and infinitesimal rotation and requirement that the sum of contact forces be equal to zero , and that the sum of contact moments be equal to zero , for all rods meeting at the given vertex . _    to the problem ( [ weak_one ] ) we can also associate the weak formulation . for that we first define the subspace @xmath45 of @xmath46 which includes the inextensibility and ushearability condition given by ( [ lj4r ] )",

    "as mentioned earlier , stent is a three - dimensional elastic body defined as a union of three - dimensional struts .    , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=65.0% ] + , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=65.0% ]",
    "each strut we model by the one - dimensional curved rod model .",

    "note that @xmath119 defines a graph and sets the topology of the stent .",
    "adding precise geometry of struts by prescribing parametrizations is also important .",
    "this actually introduces orientation in the graph however it is not important for the mechanics of the system .    a one - dimensional model of the given three - dimensional stent is given by the family of equations on each strut ( edge ) @xmath120 for all @xmath113 .",
    "additionally , we need to prescribe the coupling conditions that need to be satisfied at each vertex of the stent net where the edges ( stent struts ) meet . as mentioned earlier , two sets of coupling conditions hold :    * the kinematic coupling condition : @xmath102 continuous at each vertex , * the dynamic coupling condition : balance of contact forces ( @xmath8 ) and contact moments ( @xmath14 ) at each vertex ,    @xmath121    here @xmath122 stands for the set of all edges that leave ( i.e. the local variable is equal 0 at ) the vertex @xmath123 and @xmath124 stands for the set of all edges that enter ( i.e. the local variable is equal @xmath125 at ) the vertex @xmath123 .",
    "this constitutes the one - dimensional model of stents .",
    "since the body is not fixed at any point the solution is not unique and there is associated necessary condition for the existence .",
    "it is easy to check that the functions @xmath126 satisfy ( [ lj1ri])([lj4ri ] ) for zero loads ( @xmath127 , @xmath114 ) .",
    "further , to obtain the problem with unique solution we add the conditions @xmath128 accompanied with this nonuniqueness are necessary conditions for the existence @xmath129 these conditions are exactly the equilibrium conditions for the total force and the total moment . for more details in",
    "a bit more complex setting see @xcite .",
    "thus the model of stents we consider in the sequel is given by the rod equations ( [ lj1ri])([lj4ri ] ) , contact conditions ( [ ccs ] ) and the conditions of zero mean displacement and zero mean rotation ( [ uniqueness ] )",
    ".      next we turn to the weak and mixed formulation of the problem .",
    "the kinematic coupling conditions are satisfied by including this condition into the space of test functions , thereby requiring that all possible candidates for the solution must satisfy the continuity of displacement and the continuity of infinitesimal rotation at every net vertex ( avoiding the stent rupture ( caused by jump in displacements or infinitesimal rotations of the cross - section ) , in which case the model equations cease to be valid ) .",
    "we begin by first defining the space of @xmath2-functions @xmath130 , defined on the entire stent net @xmath109 , such that they satisfy the kinematic coupling condition at each vertex @xmath131 .",
    "the vector function @xmath130 consist of all the state variables @xmath102 defined on all the edges @xmath132 , so that @xmath133 the kinematic coupling condition requires that the displacement of the middle line @xmath12 , and the infinitesimal rotation of the cross - section @xmath13 , are continuous at every vertex @xmath131 .",
    "more precisely , at each vertex @xmath131 at which the edges @xmath134 and @xmath135 meet , the kinematic condition says that the trace of @xmath136 evaluated at the value of the parameter @xmath137 that corresponds to the vertex @xmath138 , i.e. , @xmath139 , has to be equal to the trace @xmath140 .",
    "thus , for @xmath141 , we define the space @xmath142    the dynamic coupling conditions , however , are satisfied in the weak sense by imposing this condition in the weak formulation of the underlying equations . to get to the weak formulation of the mixed formulation of the stent problem we sum up the weak forms of the mixed formulations for each strut on a space of functions",
    "@xmath143 which are defined on the whole stent and which are continuous in vertices ( globally continuous )",
    ". then by the dynamic contact conditions contact couples and forces from the right hand side of ( [ weak_one ] ) cancel out .",
    "let us denote by @xmath144 the function spaces and define bilinear forms obtained by summing the associated forms for each rod @xmath145 and the linear functional @xmath146 here , we use the notation @xmath147 let us also define the function space @xmath148 now the weak formulation is given by : find @xmath149 such that @xmath150 more details on the model can be found in @xcite .",
    "this model actually is not limited for stents .",
    "it can be used to model any elastic structure made of rods .",
    "the associated static model is rigorously justified in @xcite from three - dimensional linearized elasticity .",
    "the weak formulation of the problem is essential for obtaining the numerical approximation using the finite element method .",
    "however because of the inextensiblity and unshearability constraints that are difficult to satisfy by the finite elements the mixed problem is important .",
    "the mixed formulation of the problem ( [ weak_stent_0 ] ) is given by : find @xmath151 such that @xmath152 in the sequel we analyze the existence and uniqueness and the relation of the solution of the weak and mixed formulations .",
    "obvious part is that any solution @xmath151 of the mixed formulation is the solution of the weak formulation . for the opposite some more",
    "analysis has to be made .",
    "equivalence of the weak formulation and the mixed formulation is important in order to go back to the strong formulation .",
    "then from the mixed formulation it is easy to conclude the regularity result , namely @xmath153 even more smoothness is obtained if the force density is assumed more regular on edges .",
    "further , the strong formulation is then given by : find @xmath154 , @xmath114 and @xmath155 that satisfy the equations at edges @xmath156 that has total mean displacement and rotation zero , i.e. ( [ uniqueness ] ) holds and that the kinematic and dynamic contact conditions ( [ ccs ] ) at all vertices hold .",
    "[ rab]_inserting the displacements and infinitesimal rotations from the kernel of the stent operator , i.e. of the form ( [ ker ] ) , in the mixed formulation ( [ mixed_stent ] ) we obtain the equation @xmath157 for all @xmath158 .",
