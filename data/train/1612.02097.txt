    "type  ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) are believed to be thermonuclear runaway explosions of carbon / oxygen white dwarfs ( see , e.g. , hillebrandt & niemeyer 2000 for a review ) .",
    "observationally , sne  ia share similar light - curve shapes ; thus , traditionally the fitting of sn  ia light curves is conducted with templates constructed from well - observed sne  ia ( e.g. , jha et al .",
    "2007 ; guy et al . 2007 ) .",
    "some other attempts have also been proposed to characterize sn  ia light curves with different techniques .",
    "for example , kessler et al . (",
    "2010 ) use the supernova photometric classification challenge , a publicly released tool with simulated sne for light - curve classification of sne and photometric redshift estimation ; bazin et al .",
    "( 2011 ) employ the salt2 package ( described by guy et al . 2010 ) as a sn  ia light - curve fitter to select sn - like events through the photometric sample of the cfht supernova legacy survey ; and kim et al .",
    "( 2013 ) model sn light curves by training a parameterized model for the multiband light curves as arising from a gaussian process , followed by applying the results to spectrophotometric time series of sne to simultaneously standardize sne and fit cosmological parameters .",
    "however , to date , no single functional form has been proposed with reasonable physical meaning to fit the light curves of sne  ia from explosion to a few weeks after peak brightness . in this paper , we present an empirical fitting method to characterize the optical light curves of sne  ia by using a mathematically analytic function .",
    "assuming the sn  ia bolometric luminosity scales as the surface area of the expanding fireball ( which is approximately a blackbody at early times , modified to some degree by line blanketing in the blue and ultraviolet ) , and given that optical wavelengths are on the rayleigh - jeans tail of its nearly thermal spectral energy distribution at typical temperatures exceeding @xmath3k ( see  [ s : discussion ] ) , the optical luminosity of the sn increases quadratically with the photospheric radius ( see riess et al .",
    "1999 ) : @xmath4 ^ 2 t , \\label{eq_lvtt2}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the photospheric radius , @xmath6 is the fireball temperature , @xmath7 is the photospheric expansion velocity , @xmath8 is the time of explosion , and @xmath9 is the time after explosion . assuming that the blackbody temperature is roughly constant at early times ( see discussion below ) , the optical luminosity is @xmath10    thus , considering only very early times ( a few days after explosion )",
    ", the optical luminosity should be roughly proportional to the square of the time since explosion ( @xmath11 , commonly known as the @xmath12 model ; e.g. , arnett 1982 ; riess et al .",
    "1999 ) , _ assuming the photospheric velocity does not change much _ ( but see discussion below ) .",
    "observationally , the @xmath12 model fits well for several sne  ia with early - time observations ( e.g. , sn  2011fe , nugent et al .",
    "2011 ; sn  2012ht , yamanaka et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "however , here we aim to extend the fitting to much longer times for sne  ia ( several weeks after explosion but before entering the phase dominated by cobalt decay ) , so it is inappropriate to assume that the photospheric velocity is nearly constant ; in fact , observed spectral series show that @xmath7 drops rapidly at early times and thereafter slowly but steadily decreases ( e.g. , silverman et al .",
    "therefore , a model for the photospheric velocity evolution is required before fitting the light curves of sne  ia .",
    "zheng et al . ( 2016a ) propose a broken - power - law model to fit the photospheric velocity evolution from the explosion time to more than a month later .",
    "the function , which is also widely used for fitting gamma - ray burst afterglows as well as early - time sn  ia light curves ( e.g. , zheng et al . 2012 ; 2013 ; 2014 ) , is given by @xmath13}^{-1/s } , \\label{eq_velocity}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the photospheric velocity , @xmath14 is a scaling constant , @xmath15 is the break time , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the two power - law indices before and after the break ( respectively ) , and @xmath18 is a smoothing parameter . applying this velocity function to equation  [ eq_lvt2 ] , we find the sn  ia optical luminosity to be @xmath19}^{-2/s}. \\label{eq_lvtbkn1}\\ ] ] to simplify this , we introduce @xmath20 and @xmath21 as @xmath22 @xmath23 and so equation  [ eq_lvtbkn1 ] becomes @xmath24}^{-2/s}. \\label{eq_lvtbkn2}\\ ] ]    equation  [ eq_lvtbkn2 ] is the final function we propose to fit to sn  ia light curves for a wide time range ( from explosion to more than a month later ) .",
    "it reaches a peak value when @xmath25}. \\label{eq_tpeak}\\ ] ] the functional form of equation  [ eq_lvtbkn2 ] is very similar to the broken power - law function equation  [ eq_velocity ] , but with some variance .",
    "an advantage of the empirical equation  [ eq_lvtbkn2 ] is that there is reasonable physics behind it ; @xmath20 is considered the rising power - law index and @xmath21 the decaying index , and both are related to the photospheric velocity evolution .",
    "the function itself is also mathematically analytic , derived directly from the photospheric velocity evolution function ( along with the simple assumption that the emission is approximately that of a blackbody ) .",
    "we choose sn  2011fe as a case study to apply our fitting method ; it is the most ideal object for our purpose .",
    "first , it was discovered when extremely young and the explosion time is well constrained ( nugent et al .",

    "second , sn  2011fe is well observed both spectroscopically and photometrically in multiple bands after discovery ( e.g. , nugent et al . 2011 ; richmond & smith 2002 ; vinko et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "since the fitting function of equation  [ eq_lvtbkn2 ] is derived directly from the photospheric velocity evolution function , we first apply the velocity fitting of sn  2011fe using equation  [ eq_velocity ] , similar to the fitting of other sne given by zheng et al .",

    "a single power law ( top panel ) or a linear function ( middle - top panel ) can fit only either early - time data or later - time data independently , while a broken power law can fit all the data ( middle - bottom panel ) .",
    "the single power - law fit at early times gives an index of -0.20 , and the single linear function at later times yields @xmath27 km s@xmath28 day@xmath28 , while the composite fit gives power - law indices @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "these results are consistent with the fits to the other sne  ia ( sne  2009ig , 2012cg , 2013dy and 2016coj ) given by zheng et al .",

    ", we apply multiband light - curve fitting to sn  2011fe using equation  [ eq_lvtbkn2 ] .",

    "2011 ; richmond & smith 2002 ; vinko et al .",
    "2012 ) , excluding a few clear @xmath31 outliers among different instruments . since sne  ia",
    "usually exhibit a shoulder in the @xmath5 band and a second peak in the @xmath32 band , we restrict the fits to earlier times in the redder bands ( @xmath5 , @xmath32 ) than in the bluer bands ( @xmath2 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) . given that the explosion time of sn  2011fe is well estimated ( nugent et al .",

    "diamond - shaped data points are included in the fitting while cross - shaped ones are excluded .",
    "the fitting results cover both a long time range ( from explosion to a few weeks after peak time ) and a large flux scale ( nearly a factor of 100 , or @xmath0mag , and even @xmath1mag in @xmath2 ) . ]    as shown in figure  [ 11fe_iabkns_fitting_case1 ] , by using just a single function ( equation  [ eq_lvtbkn2 ] ) , the fitting results are surprisingly good over many weeks and nearly a factor of 100 in flux ( @xmath0mag  but @xmath1mag in @xmath2 where we have extra data from the night of discovery ) .",
    "most flux residuals are within the 12@xmath36 measurement uncertainty .",
    "the fit was applied to a long time range for all filters : for the @xmath2 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 bands , data are used up to 50 days after explosion , while @xmath5 ( 35 days ) and @xmath32 ( 31 days ) are affected by the shoulder and second peak ( respectively ) in the light curves .",
    "interestingly , although we include data only up to 50 days in @xmath34 , the model still provides a good match the data up to about 3 months post - explosion ( though this might be just a coincidence ) .",
    "the @xmath37 values derived from the fits ( table  1 ) are all around 2.1 ( except for @xmath33 , with a somewhat larger value but also more uncertain ) , close to the @xmath2-band rising index of 2.01 derived by nugent et al .",

    "in general , a rising index around 2.1 is consistent with the commonly known @xmath12 model for most sne  ia , or the @xmath38 model ( @xmath393.0 ) used by various groups ( e.g. , conley et al .",

    "since sne  ia share similar light - curve shapes , equation  [ eq_lvtbkn2 ] also has the potential to fit most other sne  ia .",
    "thus , it is important to understand the possible physics behind this expression .",
    "the form of equation  [ eq_lvtbkn2 ] is a variant of a broken - power - law function .",
    "the parameters @xmath42 , @xmath8 , and @xmath15 are easy to understand , while the parameters @xmath37 , @xmath43 , and @xmath18 are inherited from equation  [ eq_velocity ] , the photospheric velocity evolution function . here",
    ", @xmath20 represents the rising power - law index of the light curves and @xmath21 represents the decaying index .",
    "the most interesting and important parameter is probably @xmath37 ( and thus the closely related @xmath44 ) .",
    "the relation between ( @xmath37 , @xmath43 ) and ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) through equations  [ eq_alphar_alpha1 ] and [ eq_alphad_alpha2 ] comes from the derivation of equation  [ eq_lvtbkn2 ] , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the velocity decay indices from the broken power law that is measured directly from optical spectra",
    ".    however , there seems to be discrepancy between the @xmath44 value inferred from light - curve fitting and the @xmath44 value measured from the photospheric velocity ( through si  ii  @xmath266355 ) , which we denote as @xmath46 . from the light - curve fits , @xmath47 ( see table  1 , except @xmath33 ) , while from spectroscopic si  ii  @xmath266355 observations , @xmath46 is around @xmath48 ( see section [ s : sec_siii_velocity_fitting ] ) .",
    "if @xmath46 is adopted , @xmath37 would be 1.6 according to equation  [ eq_alphar_alpha1 ] , much smaller than our fit - derived value of @xmath49 .",
    "one possible reason for this discrepancy could be changes in the temperature .",
    "when deriving equation  [ eq_lvt2 ] from equation  [ eq_lvtt2 ] , we assumed the temperature @xmath6 to be constant , which is unlikely to be true for sne  ia . for sn  2011fe , mazzali et al .",
    "( 2014 ) found a significant increase in temperature during the first few days , a roughly constant temperature around peak brightness , and a relatively slow decay after peak .",
    "if we fit a power law to the first few days before peak ( see figure  [ 11fe_temperature_fitting ] , dashed line ) , we find a rising index of @xmath50 .",
    "this temperature increase would contribute together with @xmath46 to the final @xmath37 value , which would be around @xmath51 ( according to equation  [ eq_alphar_alpha1 ] ) , much closer to the observed value @xmath52 .",
    "however , even though we did not consider the changes in temperature , the formulation of equation  [ eq_lvtbkn2 ] itself can in principle accommodate all contributions by adjusting the @xmath37 value .",
    "this means that technically , it is fine to fit the light curves using equation  [ eq_lvtbkn2 ] , but the relation in equation  [ eq_alphar_alpha1 ] would not be valid owing to other contributions such as temperature changes .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 could still represent the early - time rising index , though @xmath44 would include not only the @xmath46 contribution but also the changes in temperature and perhaps other contributions .",
    "for example , we use the si  ii  @xmath266355 line to measure the photospheric velocity , but there is considerable debate regarding whether si  ii  @xmath266355 really does provide an accurate photospheric velocity ( e.g. , blondin et al .",
    "et al . 2012 )",
    ". however , for our fitting purposes , it is reasonable to assume that there is a relation between the si  ii  @xmath266355 velocity and the photospheric velocity , even if the relation varies with time ; equation  [ eq_lvtbkn2 ] can accommodate this through adjustments in the @xmath37 value during the fitting process .",
    "one may also notice that similar to @xmath44 , the @xmath45 value from the light - curve fitting ( around @xmath53 ; see table  1 ) differs from the photospheric velocity fitting ( @xmath54 ; see  [ s : sec_siii_velocity_fitting ] ) .",
    "the reason could be similar to that for @xmath44 ; after peak brightness , the temperature decreases as the fireball expands , and the ejecta also become less dense .",
    "this causes the luminosity to drop fast , with a larger absolute value for the power - law index @xmath45 ( and @xmath43 ) .",
    "technically , one can also fit the temperature with a broken power law ( see figure  [ 11fe_temperature_fitting ] , dotted line ) ; thus , both the increase and decrease of the power - law index would contribute to the light - curve fitting .",
    "but in order to simplify the fitting procedure , and considering that equation  [ eq_lvtbkn2 ] itself can accommodate the temperature changes by adjusting the @xmath37 and @xmath43 values , we did not explicitly include the temperature component in our model ; however , its contribution has been included in @xmath37 and @xmath43 during the light - curve fitting .",
    "essentially , equation  [ eq_lvtbkn2 ] represents blackbody emission from the expanding fireball of a sn  ia .",
    "the radius of the fireball is proportional to the photospheric velocity , and therefore the equation is derived directly from the photospheric velocity evolution .",
    "although when deriving equation  [ eq_lvtbkn2 ] we assumed the blackbody temperature is constant , the equation itself can accommodate the temperature changes  though the interpretation becomes more complicated if trying to distinguish the contributions from different components .",
    "nevertheless , we see that the equation has a reasonable physical explanation , and it can be used to accurately fit sn  ia light curves during at least the first month after explosion .      in reality , very few sne  ia other than sn  2011fe are discovered sufficiently early for their explosion time to be well estimated .",
    "however , a useful potential application from the above fitting method is that one can use equation  [ eq_lvtbkn2 ] to estimate the first - light or explosion time , @xmath35 . for most sne  ia ,",
    "not discovered extremely early but instead around 1 - 2 weeks after explosion and well monitored thereafter , by fitting the light curves using equation  [ eq_lvtbkn2 ] one can estimate @xmath35 .",
    "this application will be presented by zheng , kelly , & filippenko ( 2016b ) .",
    "we have found a function with a reasonable physical explanation that can well fit sn  ia optical light curves .",
    "it is mathematically analytic and derived directly from the photospheric velocity evolution , adopting the simple assumption that the optical emission is approximately the blackbody emission of an expanding fireball .",
    "applying this function to the case study of sn  2011fe gives surprisingly good results . since sne  ia share similar light - curve shapes , this fitting method has the potential to fit most other sne  ia , providing valuable benefits for large datasets of sn  ia light curves obtained with current ( e.g. , pan - starrs ; intermediate palomar transient factory ) and near - future ( e.g. , zwicky transient facility ; the large synoptic survey telescope ) facilities .",
    "we thank isaac shivvers and melissa l. graham for useful discussions and suggestions , as well as the staff of the observatories where data were obtained .",
