    "metamaterials , which are typically regular arrays of sub - wavelength resonant particles , offer us a new degree of freedom in controlling the electromagnetic response of matter .",
    "thus we are no longer completely constrained by the properties of existing materials , but can tailor the response in an almost arbitrary fashion , for example achieving very high @xcite , very low @xcite , and negative@xcite values of refractive index , permittivity and/or permeability . because of the inherently strong dispersion of resonant metamaterials , they must be modified in order to operate in a different frequency band . therefore , there is a significant push to have a further degree of control over these materials  tunability of their response .",
    "fortunately , the engineered nature of metamaterials allows their properties to be controlled externally , either by dynamically modifying their structure , or by adding some nonlinear inclusion and controlling with external fields  @xcite .",
    "examples of the latter approach include the introduction of varactor diodes  @xcite , ferroelectrics  @xcite and photo - conductive semi - conductors  @xcite . on the other hand , even without resorting to such exotic ( and often lossy ) constituents",
    ", there is a great deal of freedom to manipulate the structure itself , and this is the approach we take here .",
    "we consider specifically the split ring resonator ( srr ) as one of the most important metamaterial elements , noting that whilst the fine details of near - field interaction are structurally specific , our approach can be applied to a wide variety of structures .    an analytical model for the magnetic response of a sub - wavelength array of identically oriented wire loops loaded with a capacitance  @xcite takes into account the mutual interaction of all the elements in the lattice , which is essential for deriving the effective permeability correctly .",
    "although that analysis is limited to the quasi - static case accounting only for magnetic near - field interactions , it is crucial for revealing the consequence of lattice changes .",
    "these tend to be overlooked by otherwise rigorous approaches which include spatial dispersion but develop lorentz local field approaches , based on nearest - neighbor interaction  @xcite or point - dipole approximation  @xcite .    in particular ,",
    "it was pointed out in ref .   that the resonant frequency of the metamaterial permeability can be altered by varying the lattice constants without changing the structural units .",
    "this scheme is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice - tuning - schemes](a ) , and has been verified by experiments in ref .  . however , a practical consequence of this change in lattice constant is that the sample size also changes correspondingly .",
    "more recently , an alternative approach was suggested in ref .",
    ": introducing a shift between layers in order to create a monoclinic lattice , with the shift increasing linearly between layers , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice - tuning - schemes](b ) .",
    "this configuration keeps the density of elements within the metamaterial constant , and can tune the coupling between neighboring particles to modify the response of the complete metamaterial .",
    "however , for finite size samples , this shift inevitably results in a significant change in sample shape .",
    "thus , for practical purposes , we have proposed a super - lattice type of geometry , whereby only every second layer is shifted by the same amount , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice - tuning - schemes](c ) .",
    "this tuning scheme proved to be robust , and allows significant manipulation of the resonant frequency with only a small change in the sample geometry  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the sample geometry and its effective properties can be engineered _ almost independently _ to achieve the desired manipulation of electromagnetic waves .    ]",
    "however , as we demonstrate below , this structural tuning of metamaterials depends very strongly on the nature of the near - field interactions .",
    "since metamaterial elements such as split ring resonators are usually not highly symmetric , _ the relative orientation of particles within the lattice is of key importance_. this effect is not described by existing circuit theory models , and can give rise to some surprising experimental results , which we present here .    in order to understand the coupling mechanisms and how they are affected by the lattice shift , it is useful to start with the simplest geometry  a pair of split ring resonators .",
    "several authors have conducted numerical and experimental investigations of coupling between metamaterial elements for different types of elements and relative orientation between them , in microwave  @xcite and optical frequency ranges.(see the overview in ref .   and references therein , as well as refs .  .",
    ") a detailed study has previously been undertaken on tailoring the geometric arrangement of a pair of coupled one - dimensional srr arrays to engineer the dispersion curves of magneto - inductive waves @xcite .",
    "as we have shown recently  @xcite , a rough qualitative understanding of the structural tuning can be achieved by using circuit theory with purely inductive coupling between srrs . however",
    ", this approximation fails to provide a quantitative understanding of the metamaterial tuning in question and , most importantly , does not explain the observed strong influence of the relative srr orientation .",
    "therefore , below we develop _ a new model _",
    "based on the calculation of the fundamental mode of a single resonator .",
    "the knowledge of the current and charge distributions within the mode allows calculating the coupling constants of a pair of split rings .",
    "these constants are then used to explain the experimentally observed tuning response of our metamaterial samples .    in ,",
    "we develop our approach to calculate the metamaterial coupling , including a discussion of the limitations of other purely analytical methods . in , we apply our approach to the study of interaction between a pair of split ring resonators which are shifted laterally relative to each other , and explain quantitatively how the shift affects the position of the fundamental resonance . in , we apply these results to a bulk metamaterial and identify the mechanisms at work in the experimental tuning of a metamaterial slab in a waveguide .",
    "finally , concludes the paper with further discussions and outlook .",
    "considering a single srr , it is known@xcite that it possesses a discrete set of eigenmodes ( standing waves ) with corresponding eigenfrequencies . in an arbitrarily excited srr , the currents and charges can be represented as a superposition of the eigenmodes .",
    "the fundamental mode with the lowest frequency is relevant for the magnetic resonance in srrs . on the frequency scale",
    "this mode is well isolated from the higher - order modes , and we can restrict ourselves to the single - mode approximation neglecting the excitation of higher modes .    the time dependent charge density @xmath0 and current density @xmath1 in a resonant element with excited fundamental mode can be written in the most general form of a standing wave : @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 describe the charge and current distribution in space . in srrs ,",
    "the variation of the current distribution across the width of the conductive track could be neglected , however for generality our approach takes into account the complete 3-dimensional surface - current distribution .    to satisfy the conservation of charge @xmath6",
    "we imply that @xmath7 @xmath8 thus if the the current is known , it is easy to find the charge distribution and vice - versa .",
    "the mode profile obtained numerically for our srr geometry is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : current_charge ] .",
    "the current @xmath9 is symmetric and reaches its maximum at the point opposite to the gap . in accordance with eq .  , the charge distribution @xmath10 is antisymmetric and goes through zero where @xmath11 is maximal .",
    "we see that @xmath10 reaches its maximum magnitude near the gap .    ]    in the single mode approximation , the dynamics of the srr can be fully described by the time - dependent amplitude @xmath12 , and we may write the srr lagrangian as a sum of terms quadratic in @xmath13 and @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are constants which will be discussed below . accordingly",
    ", the srr energy reads : @xmath18 and is nicely separated into inductive ( magnetic ) and capacitive ( electric ) parts .",
    "clearly , for a passive srr we require @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the lagrangian equation of motion @xmath21 yields that the dynamics of a single srr is described by the oscillator equation for the charge amplitude : @xmath22 and the fundamental mode resonance occurs at the frequency @xmath23 .",
    "note that in contrast to the known modifications of the lagrangian formalism for metamaterials ( see e.g.  ref .  )",
    ", here we do not rely on an equivalent circuit model .",
    "although one might identify the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 as effective inductance and capacitance respectively , below we evaluate them explicitly from the known fundamental mode shape .",
    "in fact , the strongly inhomogeneous mode profile ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : current_charge ] ) suggests that it is unlikely that the correct values of the parameters would agree with those calculated from a circuit analysis .",
    "additionally , to find the resonant frequency , we do not need to calculate @xmath16 and @xmath17 explicitly , only their ratio .",
    "for the purposes of our analysis , it is sufficient to consider the case of a pair of srrs , and it will subsequently be shown that this explains all of the important features observed in our experiments with a bulk metamaterial . in this case , the lagrangian can be written as a sum of the single srr lagrangians and coupling terms , which we also write as quadratic in currents and charges : @xmath26 the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the dimensionless constants of magnetic and electric near - field interaction respectively .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian equations of motion yield the system of odes for the time - dependent amplitudes @xmath29 : @xmath30 solving these equations one finds that a pair of resonators exhibits two resonances : symmetric and antisymmetric . for the symmetric resonance , @xmath31 , which yields the resonant frequency @xmath32 while the antisymmetric mode with @xmath33 has the frequency @xmath34    the described resonance splitting is well known in the theory of harmonic oscillators .",
    "generally , bringing together two oscillators of the same resonant frequency introduces coupling between them , which results in splitting into two modes .",
    "examples have been shown of srr resonant frequency as a function of some coupling parameter , e.g.  mutual orientation@xcite or twist angle@xcite , and typically demonstrate a splitting or hybridization of modes .",
    "as we see , the direction and strength of the resonance shift are determined by the coupling constants @xmath27 and @xmath28 . to evaluate them",
    ", we use the expression for the electromagnetic energy following from the lagrangian : @xmath35 the first group of terms gives the magnetic energy and the second group describes the electric energy .",
    "a possible route to calculate @xmath27 and @xmath28 is to approximate the electric and magnetic response of each ring by a few terms of the multipole expansion .",
    "the problem with this approach is that it is based on the assumption that the observer ( i.e.  the second srr ) is at a large distance compared to the dimensions of the source .",
    "this requirement is strongly violated in our metamaterial samples , where the separation between rings is actually much smaller than the outer ring diameter .",
    "this is essential for achieving strong tuning by lattice manipulation .",
    "therefore we have chosen to calculate @xmath27 and @xmath28 numerically from the known charge and current distributions , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , of the fundamental mode in a single srr .",
    "indeed , in the single mode approximation , the energy of a pair of srrs reads @xmath36 where the parameters : @xmath37 @xmath38 the integrals can be easily evaluated once the charge and current distributions are known .",
    "the integrations over @xmath39 and @xmath40 are over the same ring if @xmath41 or over different rings otherwise .",
    "accordingly , @xmath42 is a volume containing only the first ring , and @xmath43 is a volume containing only the second .",
    "the singular terms at @xmath44 are handled using the analytical formulas given in ref .  .",
    "comparing eqs . and",
    "shows that the coupling parameters can be evaluated as @xmath45    for comparison purposes , when inductive coupling is the dominant interaction mechanism between the srrs in a metamaterial , we are able to consider an array of split rings as an array of current loops with some mutual inductance between them .",
    "this approach can then be used to define the effective permeability of a metamaterial sample@xcite . in particular , for thin wire loops with their axes oriented in the same direction , the mutual inductance can be found@xcite by numerical integration : @xmath46^{-\\frac{1}{2}},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the distance vector @xmath47 between the ring centers has been decomposed into a radial component @xmath0 and axial component @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the ring radius and @xmath50 and @xmath51 represent the angle about each ring .",
    "we can use the calculated mutual inductance to define an equivalent magnetic interaction parameter @xmath52 ( where @xmath53 denotes the self - inductance of one element ) which should approximate the interaction energy calculated from .",
    "asymptotically this interaction decays as @xmath54 , so in a large array the nearest neighbors provide the strongest contribution , but do not necessarily dominate over all others . clearly , this interaction is highly anisotropic@xcite , being positive for rings on the same axis , but negative for rings in the same plane .",
    "it is also possible to develop equivalent circuit models to calculate the electric interaction between rings . for a pair of coaxial rings ,",
    "the total interaction can be reliably modeled as a circular parallel conductor transmission line , as for broadside - coupled split ring resonators @xcite or , alternatively , with an extended circuit model accounting for the distributed capacitance and inductance @xcite .",
    "however , once we introduce some offset between the rings , these approaches are not applicable and so we do not consider them here .",
    "having developed an approach for calculating near - field interaction between a pair of rings , we now apply it to a canonical system which has the basic properties of our experimental arrangement .",
    "we consider a pair of srrs , either identically ( gap - to - gap ) oriented or rotated by 180 with respect to each other ( as in the broadside - coupled srr ) , and subject to a lateral offset @xmath55 . the geometry and incident polarization are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2rings - geometry ] .",
    "the rings have average radius @xmath56 mm , track width of 0.5 mm , metal thickness of 0.03 mm , gap width of 1 mm , and are separated in the transverse direction by 1.5 mm .",
    "the resulting resonant frequency is 10.6ghz    ]    ) and electric ( @xmath28 ) coupling parameters for broadside coupled ( @xmath57 ) and gap - to - gap ( @xmath58 ) orientation of a pair of shifted srrs .",
    "the magnetic interaction calculated from the mutual inductance is given as @xmath59 .",
    "[ fig : interaction_energy ] ]    we plot the interaction energy calculated from eq .   in fig .",
    "[ fig : interaction_energy ] , for different offsets between the rings .",
    "it can be seen that the electric coupling parameter @xmath28 is nearly symmetric between the two configurations .",
    "this can be understood from fig .",
    "[ fig : current_charge ] , where we see that the charge distribution has a strong dipole component oriented in the @xmath60 direction . for the symmetric mode of the broadside - coupled orientation the charges accumulated on the closest sides of the srrs have opposite signs , the total charge distribution has the nature of a pair of anti - parallel dipoles , thus @xmath61 , and @xmath28 is also negative .",
    "in contrast , in the gap - to - gap orientation , the closest charges are of the same sign , the total charge distribution becomes like a pair of parallel dipoles and the parameter @xmath62 .    at an offset of about one ring radius ( @xmath63 ) , the charge on one ring is approximately equidistant from both positive and negative charges on the opposite ring , thus the net coupling passes through zero . at larger offsets ,",
    "the electric coupling changes its sign but remains smaller , since only the nearest halves of the srrs are effectively interacting , with this interaction decaying towards zero as the offset increases .",
    "the magnetic interaction energy is also quite different for the two orientations , with the magnetic interaction @xmath59 calculated by eq .",
    "lying between the gap - to - gap and broadside curves .",
    "for the broadside - coupled case , the situation is qualitatively similar to the analytical result @xmath59 . at low offset , the magnetic field of one ring cuts through the other ring in the same direction to the surface normal , thus reinforcing the magnetic field and increasing the total energy",
    ". as the offset is increased , the situation gradually shifts to become like a pair of loops in the same plane , where the field from one ring cuts through the other in the opposite direction with respect to the surface normal .",
    "hence , @xmath64 undergoes a change in sign .",
    "however , in comparison to the ring with uniform current , the coupling is substantially more negative .",
    "this is due to the current maxima being on opposite sides of the rings , and hence further away from each other .    for the gap - to - gap orientation",
    "the magnetic interaction is much stronger for low @xmath55 .",
    "this is due to the current maxima being located near each other which produces a stronger contribution to the integral in @xmath65 thus increasing @xmath27 .",
    "as the rings are further separated from each other , the interaction energy reduces , but _ does not undergo a change of sign_. we can intuitively understand this by neglecting the small contributions of the current in the region near the gaps , thus we effectively have two linear current elements in the same plane which always interact with the same sign . however , this balance is not universal and is determined by the specific geometry and parameters . to check this",
    ", we studied a geometry with a very small gap , so that the current distribution was much more homogeneous , with lower resonance frequency . in this simulation ( not shown ) the magnetic coupling did change sign and both values of @xmath27 converged closely to @xmath59 .     from eq .",
    ", broken line : @xmath66 from eq .",
    "[ fig : freq-2rings ] ]    in order to verify that the calculated coupling correctly describes the frequency splitting of this system , we compare the frequency shift predicted by eq .   and",
    "with that obtained from the full numeric simulations . for consistency with our interaction energy approach",
    "we assume a homogeneous free - space background .",
    "we use the frequency domain solver of the commercial software package cst microwave studio@xcite to model a pair of rings , in a unit cell with periodic boundary conditions in the directions transverse to the propagation direction .",
    "this periodic system enables us to define a transmission coefficient , and the boundaries are 10 mm from the rings .",
    "this value is chosen to be large enough so that there is no significant interaction with periodic neighbors , yet small enough to avoid significant scattering into higher order diffraction modes .",
    "thus we can consider this the limiting case of a highly dilute metamaterial slab .",
    "the transmission spectrum as a function of offset is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : freq-2rings ] .",
    "we see that all the important features of the mode splitting are represented correctly by our single - mode theory of coupled srrs .",
    "expansion of eqs .",
    "and for small coupling predicts frequency splitting of @xmath67 , hence the curves are approximately symmetric about @xmath68 .",
    "the strong splitting observed for the broadside - coupled orientation is due to the opposite signs of the electric and magnetic coupling . at @xmath69 both @xmath64 and @xmath70 change signs ,",
    "hence the crossing of the symmetric and anti - symmetric modes is observed .",
    "in contrast , we see that for the gap - to - gap orientation , for small offset @xmath71 and @xmath72 are of the same sign , and thus they have an opposing effect , resulting in small frequency splitting . since @xmath28 decreases much faster and changes sign , the result in maximum frequency splitting for @xmath73 between 1.1 and 1.5 .",
    "we note that in ref .",
    "the resonant frequency based on @xmath59 was compared with experimental results for the gap - to - gap orientation , and strong disagreement was found .",
    "it can be seen that the calculated transmission through the cell exhibits different depths of the resonance for the symmetric and antisymmetric modes .",
    "this is due to the different efficiency of coupling between the modes and the incident plane wave .",
    "for instance , it is impossible to excite the anti - symmetric mode with a normally - incident plane wave for @xmath74 , since both rings are excited in - phase .",
    "as the offset is increased , some retardation between the rings occurs , and excitation of the anti - symmetric mode is allowed .",
    "there are several reasons for the small quantitative disagreement between the exact calculations and those based on the calculated interaction energy .",
    "firstly , the minimum of transmission occurs at a frequency slightly different from the resonant frequency , due to coupling effects ( impedance matching ) between the incident wave and the ring .",
    "secondly , there may be some small contribution of higher srr eigenmodes due to perturbation of the charge and current distributions .",
    "thirdly , there may still be some small influence of the periodic boundaries . finally , our developed relations neglect retardation , which is strictly valid in the sub - wavelength limit , whereas the the outer radius of the rings is @xmath75 at @xmath68 .",
    "retardation has previously been shown to modify the interaction between srrs through its influence on the dispersion of magneto - inductive waves in arrays@xcite .",
    "we emphasize that our approach developed in is advantageous over the direct numerical calculation .",
    "firstly , once the mode profile is known , calculation of the frequencies in fig .",
    "[ fig : freq-2rings ] takes approximately 30 seconds on a single cpu , whereas the direct calculation of the full spectrum takes several hours on a multi - core machine .",
    "secondly , we are clearly able to demonstrate the nature of the coupling , which yields insight into the tuning behavior .",
    "for split ring resonator slab in waveguide , for ( a ) broadside - coupled and ( b ) gap - to - gap orientation of adjacent layers . [",
    "fig : experimental - tuning ] ]     for split ring resonator slab in waveguide , for ( a ) broadside - coupled and ( b ) gap - to - gap orientation of adjacent layers .",
    "[ fig : experimental - reflection ] ]    we now apply our approach to explain experimental results for tuning the response of a slab of metamaterial .",
    "the metamaterial is fabricated using photolithography to etch copper tracks onto fr4 printed circuit board , using the same geometry as in our numerical simulation of a pair of rings .",
    "the fabricated sample has 30 layers , each with 5 rings in the propagation direction and is only one ring in height ( i.e.  a @xmath76 array ) .",
    "the longitudinal period of the sample is 7 mm , the transverse period is dictated by the sample thickness ( 1.5 mm ) as there is no spacing between boards . as with the pair of rings , we have assembled slabs with two relative orientations of the split rings in adjacent planes  gap - to - gap and broadside - coupled .",
    "the sample is placed in the center of a wr229 rectangular metallic waveguide , with dimensions 58.17@xmath7729.08 mm , excited at its dominant te@xmath78 mode .",
    "we removed the influence of the coaxial adapters and feeding waveguide sections by performing a trl ( through - reflect - line ) calibration @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : experimental - tuning ] we show the experimentally obtained transmission through each slab of closely coupled srrs , with the corresponding reflection shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : experimental - reflection ] .    ]",
    "the shift of resonant frequency shows good qualitative agreement with the results for a pair of rings presented in , with very similar changes in the spectrum observed ( noting that @xmath79 corresponds to @xmath80 ) .",
    "however , for the gap - to - gap orientation , numerical simulation of a system of two boards with 5 rings each , and _ periodic boundaries _ in both transverse directions ( not shown ) , is qualitatively similar to the experimentally observed results but quantitatively highly inaccurate .",
    "the reason turns out to be the loss of symmetry when the system is placed inside the waveguide , because the upper and lower waveguide walls do not correspond to periodic boundaries , but instead represent planes of mirror reflection .",
    "therefore , this system must be described as having a super - lattice arrangement in the vertical as well as horizontal planes , with each super - cell consisting of four srrs .",
    "this cell has alternating orientation of the srrs in the vertical direction corresponding to the planes of mirror symmetry , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : superlattice - geometry](b ) . once this unit cell is taken into account ,",
    "numerical simulations are in a good agreement with the experiment ( fig .",
    "[ fig : freq - waveguide](b ) ) .",
    "naturally , numerical simulations for the broadside - coupled orientation also agree well with the experiment ( fig .",
    "[ fig : freq - waveguide](a ) ) . in this case",
    "a very similar result is provided with simple periodic boundary conditions ( not shown ) .",
    "for this orientation the super - lattice effectively formed by the waveguide shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : superlattice - geometry](a ) does not have an essentially different symmetry to the original super - lattice .    ]",
    "we can conclude that in both cases the dominant mode of the slab corresponds to the dominant symmetric mode of a pair of rings , with a similar pattern of resonant frequency _ vs. _  offset occurring .",
    "the weaker coupling to the modes for the gap - to - gap orientation is due to the shape of the symmetric mode .",
    "its magnetic field has a large component parallel to that of the waveguide mode , however its electric field is primarily longitudinal , in contrast to the transverse electric field of the waveguide mode .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : freq - waveguide](b ) , we see two higher order modes , which most likely correspond to the higher order resonances observed in the experimental results in fig .  [",
    "fig : experimental - tuning](b ) . from the numerical simulations we observe that the current distributions of these modes are symmetric",
    ", thus they correspond to higher - order modes of the metamaterial slab , and not to the anti - symmetric mode of a pair of rings .",
    "in contrast , in fig .",
    "[ fig : freq - waveguide](a ) there is a weakly coupled anti - symmetric mode , which we verified by inspection of the currents .",
    "this mode also qualitatively agrees with the corresponding mode of the pair of rings , with somewhat weaker coupling due to the increased mismatch to the incident waveguide mode .",
    "this mode may correspond to some of the smaller features observable in fig .",
    "[ fig : experimental - tuning](a ) , however due to the size of these features this can not be reliably determined .",
    "we do not consider offsets greater than @xmath81 , since in an infinite lattice only shifts between 0 and 0.5 are unique , while in a finite structure , larger shifts result in very irregular boundaries .",
    "note that in the simulations we have neglected the effect of the mode profile of the rectangular waveguide , which would correspond to an effective variation of the angle of incidence of the plane wave as a function of frequency , which can result in a different response due to the anisotropy and non - negligible spatial dispersion of the medium@xcite .",
    "clearly the coupling in the complete lattice is much more complicated than in the simple two - ring system , as the interactions between a large number of rings must be taken into account . in principle",
    "it is possible to extend the analysis of to an arbitrary number of rings .",
    "however the qualitative agreement between the experimental results and the modelled pair of rings suggests that the phenomenology developed for the two rings is generally applicable and leads to correct predictions .",

    "the modelled pair of rings suggests that the phenomenology developed in for the two rings can be extended to an arbitrary number of rings .",
    "although an accurate generalization of our modelling approach to a bulk system lies beyond the scope of this paper , it is clear that the resulting homogenized effective metamaterial parameters will exhibit similar tuning pattern due to the resonance shift .",
    "note that the introduction of the effective parameters is justified when the ratio of the unit cell size to the incident wavelength is small .",
    "therefore , when considering modifications of the lattice which create a super - lattice structure , the size of the super - cell should be smaller than the wavelength .",
    "there are homogenisation approaches in the literature ( e.g. ref .  ) which include unknown parameters for interaction between resonant elements and our semi - analytical approach would make an ideal tool for evaluating these constants .",

    "this paves a road towards a reliable design and development of tunable metamaterials for various applications .",
    "we note that the specific geometry of the split rings can have a very significant influence on the qualitative nature of the coupling , including cases which run counter to our intuitive understanding of current loops interacting magnetically .    finally , we point out that the approach developed here for modeling near - field effects is particularly promising for metamaterials scaled down to operate at optical frequencies . in the visible ,",
