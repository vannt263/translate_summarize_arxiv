    "in quantum systems with purely unitary evolutions , the total energy is a conserved quantity , since the corresponding hamiltonian always commutes with itself .",
    "however , this argument does not apply to systems with hamiltonians which are self - adjoint but not hermitian @xcite and to open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous emission of a photon is always related to the loss of energy from its source @xcite .",
    "for example , in laser sideband cooling , a red - detuned laser field excites an electronic state of a strongly confined ion via the annihilation of a phonon from its motion . when followed by spontaneous photon emission , the phonon",
    "is permanently lost @xcite .",
    "contrarily to common believe , we show here that even un - excited and un - driven quantum systems might constantly leak energy into their environment .",
    "the origin of the predicted effect are non - zero decay rates and the counter - rotating terms in the interaction hamiltonian which are usually neglected as part of the rwa .",
    "although the validity of this approximation has been questioned in the past @xcite , it is commonly used to describe quantum optical systems .",
    "an exception is hegerfeldt @xcite , who shows that the counter - rotating terms in the interaction between two atoms and the free radiation field can result in a small violation of einstein s causality .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite also avoided the rwa and predicted corrections to the spontaneous decay rate of a single atom at very short times .",

    "@xcite pointed out that it might be possible to obtain photons by simply placing an atom inside an optical cavity but no quantitative predictions have been made and no justification for the relevant master equation has been given . when avoiding the rwa , it has to be avoided everywhere , also in the system - bath interaction .",
    "this paper contains a rigorous derivation of the quantum optical master equation for bosonic systems which uses only the born and the dipole approximation .",
    "we apply our results to individual quantum systems ( trapped atoms and optical cavities ) , and to a composite quantum system consisting of many atoms inside an optical resonator .",
    "it is shown that for sufficiently large numbers of atoms inside the cavity , the stationary state photon emission rate can be as large as typical detector dark count rates .",
    "its parameter dependence could be verified experimentally using currently available atom - cavity systems @xcite .",
    "our calculations confirm the relevance of the effects predicted in @xcite when the atom - cavity interactions are collectively enhanced @xcite .",
    "similar energy concentrating effects might contribute significantly to the sudden heating in sonoluminescence experiments @xcite and are responsible for temperature limits in cooling experiments @xcite .",
    "there are five sections in this paper .",
    "section [ model ] contains a rigorous derivation of the master equation of a single bosonic quantum system beyond the validity range of the rwa .",
    "section [ single ] calculates the corresponding stationary photon emission rate . assuming that the photon emission in the absence of external driving remains negligible in this case",
    ", we find that two of the constants in this master equation are approximately zero .",
    "section [ comp ] uses an analogously derived master equation to calculate the stationary state cavity photon emission rate for a composite quantum system consisting of many atoms inside an optical resonator . for feasible experimental parameters ,",
    "we predict stationary state emission rates as high as @xmath0 photons per second . a detailed discussion of our results can be found in section [ conc ] .",
    "let us begin by studying individual quantum systems , like optical cavities and tightly confined atoms , with the ability to emit photons .",

    "the crucial difference to the usual jaynes - cummings model @xcite is the presence of the @xmath111 and the @xmath112 term in ( [ h2 ] ) which vanish in the rwa . as we shall see below",

    ", the cavity becomes populated  even in the absence of external driving.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "let us now discuss the same topic in a more physical way . among the reasons usually produced to justify the rwa , there is the one of the time scale , since the counter - rotating terms oscillate very rapidly so that their contribution to the dynamics remains in general negligible with respect to the resonating ones @xcite .",
    "other authors apply the rwa in order to preserve quantum numbers and energy @xcite , since this approximation drops all the processes transferring energy between non - resonating modes .",
    "however , in nature , there exist processes , where there is a redistribution of energy among different system degrees of freedom making possible some amounts of system self - organization .",
    "in particular , one could examine the possibility of concentrating the total energy of the system into a subset of degrees of freedom producing a decrease of its entropy , which in order to avoid a violation of the second law of thermodynamics , would compel the release of energy to the environment , thus keeping the free energy constant .",
    "this is possible , of course , only when the system is open .    in this paper",
    ", we consequently examined the situation occurring when the counter - rotating terms are not dropped .",
    "the avoidance of the rwa and the consequent more exact solution of the dynamics of the system under consideration gives rise to non - trivial consequences . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the mechanism of concentration of energy on a subset of degrees of freedom could help the understanding of the hitherto rather mysterious processes of self - organization .",
    "the mathematical analysis we have done above shows indeed that in a quantum system a leakage of energy can occur among different degrees of freedom .",
    "this leakage is not necessarily triggered by an external pump of energy , but could be also triggered by the virtual photons coming from the quantum vacuum as , e.g. , it occurs in the casimir effect or in the lamb shift . from the standpoint of the receiving system ,",
    "the origin of the triggering energy is not important as far as the balance between the variations of energy and entropy is satisfied so to keep the free energy constant . in this respect , we recall that the ratio between these variations is just the temperature , as required by the thermodynamic definition : @xmath136    the interplay between the microscopic quantum dynamics and the thermal properties certainly deserves further analysis , which , however , is out of the scope of the present paper .",
    "here we are limiting ourselves to a specific physical picture , which however , does not exclude other physical scenarios , as , for example , the conversion of energy from the thermal bath phonons to leaking photons ( as it occurs in the laser cooling mechanism ) .",
    "more appealing could be the occurrence of a dynamics , where a system is able to reach a state having a lower energy jumping over a separating barrier with the help of virtual photons coming from the vacuum .",
    "the possibility of realization of these scenarios needs of course further studies .",
    "first indications along the above lines can be found in the literature @xcite . in all these examples ,",
    "the system dynamics is irreversible .    in summary , we derived the master equation for a single bosonic system ( an optical cavity and a large number of tightly confined particles ) without making any approximation other than the usual dipole and born approximation .",
    "we find that the effect of the counter - rotating terms in the interaction between a quantum optical system and its free radiation field might be annihilated by environment - induced measurements whether or not a photon has been emitted . assuming that this is the case",
    ", we then show that these measurements can not suppress the interaction between a large number of atoms and an optical cavity .",
    "the result is the continuous leakage of photons through the resonator mirrors , even in the absence of external driving . for sufficiently many atoms , a relatively strong signal",
    "might be created .",
    "its dependence on the system parameters can be verified experimentally using optical cavities like those described in @xcite .",
    "we recognize that in order to better understand the physical mechanisms responsible for the mathematical results presented in this paper , some more work is needed which is in our plans for future publications .",
