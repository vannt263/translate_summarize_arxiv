    "pair production process plays an important role in pulsar physics .",
    "it is not only a necessary process for the multiplication of the particles to account for emissions of different bands from pulsars ( e.g. sturrock 1971 ; ruderman & sutherland 1975 ; arons & scharleman 1979 ; arons 1983 ; cheng , ho , & ruderman 1986 ) , but also an important mechanism to absorb @xmath0-rays produced in the pulsar magnetospheres , especially near the polar cap region ( e.g. hardee 1977 ; harding , tademaru , & esposito 1978 ; harding 1981 ; daugherty & harding 1982 , 1996 ; zhao _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ; lu & shi 1990 ; lu , wei , & song 1994 ; dermer & sturner 1994 ; sturner , dermer , & michel 1995 ; wei , song , & lu 1997 ) .",
    "furthermore , the way by which the @xmath0-rays are absorbed is also the key factor to limit the parameters of the inner magnetospheric accelerators of pulsars ( e.g. ruderman & sutherland 1975 , hereafter rs75 ; zhang & qiao 1996 ; qiao & zhang 1996 ; zhang _ et al . _ 1997a ; zhang , qiao , & han 1997b , hereafter zqh97b ) .",
    "pair formation in intense magnetic fields ( @xmath4 process ) has been studied explicitly by different authors ( e.g. erber 1966 ; tsai & erber 1974 ; daugherty & harding 1983 , rifert , mszros & bagoly 1989 ) , and its importance in pulsar physics was first pointed out by sturrock ( 1971 ) .",
    "daugherty & lerche ( 1975 , hereafter dl75 ) first dealt with the case involving a relatively weaker electric field perpendicular to the magnetic field ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) , and came to a unified formula of the attenuation coefficient of the @xmath0 photons . the more general case involving both the perpendicular and the parallel components of the electric field with respect to the magnetic field ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) was presented by daugherty & lerche ( 1976 ) and urrutia ( 1978 ) . in the specific case of pulsars , although @xmath8 is usually sufficiently small so that its effect is negligible , @xmath7 induced by the fast spin of the neutron stars was demonstrated to be very important in pair formation process by dl75 .",
    "this leads many authors to take this effect seriously into account in their studies ( e.g. hardee 1977 ; lu & shi 1990 ; lu , wei , & song 1994 ; qiao & zhang 1996 ) .    in this paper , we ll argue that although the unified formula of dl75 is correct , their conclusion that the induced electric fields are important in the pair formation process in the pulsar magnetospheres is wrong and misleading . the detailed argument is presented in section 2 and section 3 .",
    "finally , we discuss the possible implications of this modification .",
    "the attenuation coefficient of converting a @xmath0 photon into electron - positron pairs in a pure strong magnetic field with a perpendicular component @xmath9 is expressed as @xmath10 with @xmath11 under the condition of @xmath12 ( erber 1966 ) . here",
    "@xmath13 denotes the fine structure constant , @xmath14 is the reduced compton wavelength of the electron , @xmath15 g is the critical magnetic field , and @xmath16 is the energy of the @xmath0 photon .    if a relatively weaker electric field perpendicular to the magnetic field ( i.e. @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) exists , the attenuation coefficient can be derived by performing a lorentz transformation ( dl75 ) . with the positive @xmath17 and @xmath18-axes being the direction of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively",
    ", this attenuation coefficient , which is a function of the direction cosines ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) of the photon , is expressed by dl75 ( see their eq.(9 ) ) .",
    "note that the positive @xmath24-axis is just the moving direction of a frame with a `` drifting '' velocity of @xmath25 , in which the electric field vanishes completely .",
    "this velocity is also the `` co - rotating velocity '' of the particles in a pulsar s magnetosphere when the magnetic axis is aligned with the rotational axis .",
    "dl75 s derivation of the general formula ( their eq.(9 ) ) is by all means correct . for @xmath26^{1/2})$ ]",
    "( their _ case ( d ) _ ) , they derived @xmath27 , which means that in two special directions , the @xmath0 photons can traverse the electromagnetic field freely without being absorbed at all .",
    "another special case is @xmath28 ( their _ case ( e ) _ ) , i.e. the @xmath0 photon is moving along the direction of the magnetic field . and they obtained @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "it just like that @xmath31 in eq.(2 ) has replaced @xmath9 in eq.(1 ) apart from a multiplicative factor @xmath32 .    in a pulsar magnetosphere , when we observe in the laboratory frame , a spin - induced electric field satisfying @xmath33 should exist to fulfill the force - free condition ( goldreich & julian 1969 ) , where @xmath34 is the co - rotating velocity at a given point in the magnetosphere .",
    "this electric field is perpendicular to @xmath35 and is much smaller than @xmath35 since @xmath36 in the pulsar polar cap region .",
    "so dl75 s formula can be used to deal with this problem .",
    "dl75 argued that the photon s direction should be nearly parallel to @xmath35 in the pulsar magnetosphere , so they came to the conclusion that their _ case ( e ) _ is proper and the induced electric field plays a considerable role in the pair production process , especially for those rapidly spinning pulsars .    but",
    "this argument is unfortunately wrong , since it results in very unnatural conclusions .",
    "first , consider a special magnetic field configuration ( although it does not exist at all in nature ) with straight field lines co - rotating with the magnetosphere .",
    "in the co - rotating frame where the electric field vanishes , a particle will move strictly along the field line and hence , emit a @xmath0 photon by a certain mechanism in the direction ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 ray can not be absorbed since there is no perpendicular magnetic field component at all .",
    "but if one observes the same process in the laboratory frame , according to dl75 , eq.(2 ) shows that the absorption is quite severe since there exists a very strong rotation - induced electric field .",
    "we see contradictory pictures in two different observer s frames .",
    "secondly , in a curved magnetic field , a @xmath0-ray can travel a distance until @xmath9 achieves a sufficient value to absorb it . but according to eq.(2 ) , a @xmath0-ray can be directly absorbed severely at the very position it is produced .",
    "this means that in a rapidly rotating pulsar magnetosphere , the relatively high energy @xmath0 photons can hardly be formed at all .",
    "this is also quite unnatural .",
    "what is wrong ?",
    "the problem lies in the dl75 s misusing ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) as the photon direction in the laboratory frame . in a strong magnetic field , the very short lifetime on the higher landau energy levels makes an electron almost always stay in its ground state , so it is described that an electron moves along the field lines and emits photons at the tangent moving direction ( e.g. the curvature radiation or the inverse compton scattering ) . but",
    "this picture is strictly correct only in the frame where there is no perpendicular electric field , or in the `` co - rotating '' frame for a aligned pulsar . if the observer moves with respect to the magnetic field ( e.g. in the laboratory frame ) so that an induced electric field exists , the directions of the field line , of the electron , and of the photon are all different from each other since they obey different transformation laws .",
    "suppose two inertia frames : frame @xmath37 , the instantaneous co - rotating frame where the electric field vanishes so that the three directions are aligned ; and frame @xmath38 , the laboratory frame where the three directions may be misaligned ( denoted by the angles between them and the positive x - axis , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) .",
    "frame @xmath38 moves at a relative speed @xmath42 with respect to frame @xmath43 , where @xmath34 is the co - rotating velocity .",
    "the positive @xmath24-axis is defined as the direction of @xmath34 .",
    "the lorentz transformation of the electromagnetic field then results in ( in order to be simple , we assume the direction of @xmath44 is in @xmath45 plane ) @xmath46 where @xmath47 and the subscript `` r '' tells the lorentz factor of the rotation from that of the particle .",
    "and the velocity lorentz transformation comes to @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the velocity of the particle along the magnetic field line in the frame @xmath43 .",
    "the aberration effect makes @xmath50 although @xmath51 in the frame @xmath37 , usually @xmath52 in the frame @xmath38 .",
    "physically , since an induced electric field @xmath19 exists in the laboratory frame @xmath38 , a `` drifting '' velocity component @xmath53 will be added to the electrons besides the component along the magnetic field @xmath20 .    in the case of an `` aligned rotator '' whose magnetic and rotational axes are in the same direction , the relative velocity of the two frames is perpendicular to the magnetic field line in the co - moving frame , i.e. @xmath54 . using eqs .",
    "( 3,5 ) , we can obtain @xmath55 and the photon s direction in frame @xmath38 as @xmath56^{1/2})$ ] rather than @xmath2 , where @xmath57 is the angle between the direction of @xmath0-ray and that of the field line in frame @xmath38 ( i.e. @xmath58 ) .",
    "note this direction is just the direction @xmath59^{1/2})$ ] ( for an aligned rotator @xmath34 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are perpendicular to each other ) .",
    "this is just the _ case ( d ) _ rather than the _ case ( e ) _ in dl75 , so that @xmath60 is satisfied , i.e. the induced electric field plays no role in the @xmath0-ray absorption process at the emission point since the emission is produced at a preferred direction .",
    "the two `` unnatural conclusions '' get away now . in the `` straight field ''",
    "configuration , the @xmath0 photon will not be absorbed in the laboratory frame , either , since it is just emitted in the absorption - free direction .",
    "so no contradiction lies in the two frames .",
    "furthermore , no energy restriction on pair production is performed anywhere in the pulsar magnetosphere because a @xmath0-ray will never be severely absorbed before it moves a distance for @xmath9 to achieve a sufficient value to absorb it .    in the polar cap region of a pulsar ,",
    "the co - rotating velocity is much smaller than the speed of light , so that @xmath61 is very small and usually we can still regard the three directions described above to be the same . but in discussing the pair formation process , the attenuation coefficient @xmath62 is very sensitive to the incident angle .",
    "it is just this very small deviation of the incident angle that really counts .",
    "now another question arises : propagation makes a @xmath0 photon encounter other bunches of field lines and changes the incident angle .",
    "will the induced electric field be important at this time ?",
    "according to the above discussions , a @xmath0 photon will be initially emitted at an incident angle @xmath63 in the laboratory frame for an aligned rotator , where @xmath3 is the co - rotating velocity at the emission point . neglecting the general relativity effect",
    ", the photon will move along a straight line and intersect other bunches of the magnetic field lines . the incident angle of this @xmath0 photon",
    "gets smaller and smaller , and asymptotically merges to zero at infinity where the direction @xmath2 is usable , if we again assume the magnetic field lines are straight and are perpendicular to the rotating axis ( i.e. there is no field - line - curvature - caused @xmath9 at all after the photon moves a distance , see fig.1 ) .",
    "the magnetic field is assumed to be also declined as @xmath64 .",
    "our adopting this unrealistic but simple magnetic field configuration is just for the sake of examining the importance of the propagation - caused absorption effect .",
    "suppose the @xmath0 photon with @xmath65mev is emitted at a height of @xmath66 from the neutron star surface ( @xmath67 is the radius of the neutron star ) .",
    "after it travels a distance @xmath68 ( @xmath69 is the travel time ) , the incident angle changes to @xmath70 . submitting @xmath71 into dl75 s eq.(9 ) , we can get the attenuation coefficient of the photon as a function of the travel distance ( see fig.2 ) . the extreme case of @xmath72",
    "is also marked .",
    "from fig.2 we can see that the induced electric field is also of minor importance , since the attenuation coefficients are always at least two order - of - magnitudes smaller than that of the case ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) .",
    "although the unified formula for the pair production process involving both the magnetic field and the perpendicular electric field derived by dl75 is correct , we have argued in this paper that their conclusion that the induced electric fields are important in the pair formation process in the pulsar magnetospheres is wrong and misleading at least for the `` aligned rotator '' case . at the emission point ,",
    "the photon emitted by a certain mechanism ( e.g. the curvature radiation or the inverse compton scattering ) just moves along the very direction in which the attenuation coefficient is zero .",
    "considering the propagation of the photon , we found that this rotation - induced electric field still plays a minor role in the @xmath0-ray absorption process in the polar cap region of a pulsar .",
    "for the general case of an `` oblique rotator '' in which the magnetic and the rotational axes are misaligned , the co - rotating velocity is no more perpendicular to the magnetic field so that @xmath73 ( also @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) is not @xmath76 .",
    "the photon direction consequently deviate from @xmath1^{1/2})$ ] slightly . from fig.2",
    ", we see that the attenuation coefficient is also very small around the direction @xmath1^{1/2})$ ] , so that the conclusion that the induced electric field plays a minor role in @xmath0-ray absorption still holds for the oblique rotator case .",
    "actually , dl75 s result can only be applied to the aligned case strictly , since generally the co - rotating velocity @xmath77 is not equal to @xmath78 , with which one can define a frame where the electric field vanishes completely . in the co - rotating frame of an oblique rotator , an electric field component parallel to the magnetic field will still remain so that dl75 s application condition fails .",
    "our results in this paper may have some implications for some previous studies which regard the electric field as the important effect of @xmath0-ray absorption ( e.g. hardee 1977 ; zhao _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ; lu & shi 1990 ; lu , wei , & song 1994 ; qiao & zhang 1996 ) .",
    "although the polar cap models of the @xmath0-ray pulsars are by all means sound in principle , their concrete details will alter much by ejecting the induced electric field .",
    "specifically , based on dl75 s result , hardee ( 1977 ) got an absolute upper limit to the photon energies @xmath79 ( his eq.(38 ) ) at which escape of the @xmath0-rays from the magnetosphere is possible .",
    "it should be replaced by a threshold in the pure magnetic field absorption scheme @xmath80 ( wei , song , & lu 1997 , their eq.(10 ) , @xmath81 and the last open field line is assumed ) .",
    "thus the generation order parameters proposed by lu , wei , & song ( 1994 ) should take the form in wei , song , & lu ( 1997 , their eq.(17 ) ) .",
    "the three boundary lines ( birth line , death line and appearance line ) in the @xmath82 diagram of pulsars derived by qiao & zhang ( 1996 ) are also based on the electric field absorption .",
    "the details will also be changed by ejecting the electric field , but the picture still remains and may give a hint to us about the magnetic field configuration in the neutron star vicinity ( qiao & zhang , discussions ) . .",
