    "europium titanate , eutio@xmath0 , was the first ternary compound of divalent eu@xmath5 to be identified . @xcite it is a g - type antiferromagnet ( afm ) with the low magnetic ordering temperature of 5.3  k , consistent with the highly localized @xmath6 electrons on the eu@xmath5 ions .",
    "@xcite until recently , its structural ground state was thought to be the ideal cubic perovskite structure , with @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "@xcite eutio@xmath0 is insulating with a high dielectric constant ( @xmath7 ) at low temperature , indicating quantum paraelectric behavior and proximity to ferroelectric instability .",
    "@xcite strong interactions between the magnetic and dielectric properties have been reported @xcite including evidence for an unusual third - order coupling .",
    "@xcite it has been suggested that eutio@xmath0 is the prototype for studying quantum paraelectric behavior in magnetic systems .",
    "@xcite    in addition to these experiments on bulk eutio@xmath0 , there has been a series of recent studies on eutio@xmath0 thin films @xcite motivated in part by the subsequently verified prediction that epitaxial strain should induce ferroelectricity and multiferroicity .",
    "@xcite likewise  chemical strain  ,",
    "_ i_.e . doping at the a - site with larger divalent ions , has been shown to induce ferroelectricity , e.g. in alloys with batio@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite the latter is particularly intriguing , as multiferroic ( eu , ba)tio@xmath0 ceramics fulfil the requirements for a solid state search for the electric dipole moment of electron .",
    "@xcite    in this work we re - visit bulk eutio@xmath0 , with a particular focus on the possibility that the ground state is not , in fact , the high symmetry @xmath4 perovskite protoype , but a lower symmetry structure possessing rotations or tilts of the oxygen octahedra . until recently",
    ", all computational studies of eutio@xmath0 had neglected this possibility .",
    "@xcite we mentioned recently in ref .   that in the course of calculating the properties of ( eu , ba)tio@xmath0 we noticed a calculated antiferrodistorted ground state for eutio@xmath0 . then in ref",
    "the influence of such possible oxygen octahedra tiltings on the induced polarization in strained eutio@xmath0 was discussed .",
    "finally , a recent study @xcite confirmed experimentally the presence of a structural phase transition in eutio@xmath0 using specific heat measurements , and suggested , in analogy to srtio@xmath0 , that the low - temperature phase should have oxygen rotations and @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "our present _ ab initio _ study of eutio@xmath0 was motivated by a series of experimental papers , @xcite in which infrared ( ir ) reflectivity and time - domain terahertz transmission spectra of eutio@xmath0 ceramics yielded intriguing results that can be better understood if the crystalline symmetry is lower then @xmath4 . the studies @xcite found three polar optical phonons between @xmath8  k , typical for the perovskite structure .",
    "analysis of the oscillator strengths ( or equivalently , the mode - plasma frequencies ) and comparison of their values with those of known perovskite prototypes such as pbtio@xmath0 ( with ferroelectrically active a- and b - site cations ) and batio@xmath0 ( with active b - site cations ) suggested that ( i ) the lowest - energy transverse - optical ( to ) phonon to1 corresponds predominantly to the slater mode , @xcite with opposite vibration of the ti cations and the oxygen octahedra ( fig .  [ fig : perovskite_modes ] left ) ; softening of this mode dominates the quantum paraelectric behavior , ( ii ) the second lowest - energy to2 phonon consists of vibrations of the eu cation against the tio@xmath9 octahedra , commonly known as the last mode , ( fig .",
    "[ fig : perovskite_modes ] center ) , and ( iii ) the highest frequency to4 ( the to3 mode is not ir active ) phonon represents oxygen octahedral bending , usually called an axe mode ( fig .",
    "[ fig : perovskite_modes ] right ) .",
    "however , some features observed in the experiment are not understood : ( i ) a significant temperature dependence of the oscillator strength was found for the to1 and to2 modes , indicating changes in the vibrational mode eigenvectors with temperature .",
    "the changes are most apparent in the temperature range @xmath10  k ( see figure  5 in ref .  ) , with the oscillator strength for the to1 mode decreasing and for the to2 mode increasing with increasing temperature .",
    "( ii ) the width of the peak in the imaginary dielectric function @xmath11 that is associated with the soft to1 mode increases when temperature is lowered .",
    "this is unusual , because at low temperature anharmonic effects that could give rise to the widening of the peak in @xmath11 usually decrease ( see figure  3(b ) in ref .  ) .",
    "( iii ) the mode at around 420  @xmath12 in the ir reflectivity spectrum is temperature dependent ( see figure  2 in ref .  ) .",
    "however the eu@xmath13ti@xmath13o@xmath14 pyrochlore phase , to which this peak was tentatively assigned , does not show a structural phase transition .    in this work we present a detailed density - functional theory based study of the structural and vibrational properties of antiferromagnetic eutio@xmath0 .",
    "our main finding is that the ground state is not in fact the high symmetry @xmath4 structure ( in analogy with other perovskite materials , for example knbo@xmath0@xcite ) , but a lower symmetry phase with tilts and rotations of the oxygen octahedra .",
    "the calculated properties of the lower symmetry phase are more consistent with the measured behavior than those calculated for the high symmetry @xmath4 structure . in addition",
    ", we obtain a strong magneto - phonon interaction in our new ground - state structure .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : details ] we describe the technical details of our calculations ; section  [ sec : results ] contains the results of our calculations of the structural and dynamical properties of eutio@xmath0 , and a new interpretation of the ir optical properties along with the influence of magnetic fields .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we carried out first - principles density - functional calculations within the spin - polarized generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite .",
    "for the electronic structure calculations and structural relaxations we used projector augmented - wave potentials as implemented in vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) .",
    "@xcite we considered the following valence - electron configuration : @xmath15 for eu , @xmath16 for ti , and @xmath17 for oxygen .    to account for the strong electron correlation effects on the @xmath18-shells of eu atoms , we used the dft+u scheme @xcite in dudarev s approach @xcite with an on - site coulomb parameter u=5.7  ev and hund s exchange j@xmath19=1.0  ev after ref .  .",
    "we have checked our main conclusions ( i.e. the stability of the antiferrodistorted phases relative to the cubic phase ) for several values of these parameters ( u = 4 to 8 ev ) as well as without the lda+u correction and obtained the same result .",
    "we used a kinetic energy cutoff of 500  ev and a @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) @xmath22-centered @xmath23-point mesh for the unit cell ( supercell ) simulations .",
    "spin - orbit interaction was not taken into account .",
    "the experimental lattice parameter of the cubic phase of eutio@xmath0 , 3.90   , @xcite was used instead of the theoretical value of 3.943   . for structural relaxations which involved changes of the unit cell shape we performed a fixed - volume relaxation to suppress the known gga overestimation of the lattice volume . in the structural relaxations we minimized hellman - feynman forces to 0.5 mev /  . to investigate the structural stability",
    ", we utilized @xmath24 supercells containing 40 atoms .",
    "this allowed us to investigate all possible structural distortions which can originate from the zone - boundary instabilities in a systematic way and to minimize the error in total energy calculations when comparing energies of the different structures . for each symmetry investigated ,",
    "the initial ideal perovskite structure was distorted according to the corresponding oxygen octahedral rotation pattern , and then the internal atomic positions and lattice parameters were relaxed until the convergence criteria were reached .",
    "the calculations of the dynamical properties were performed using the force - constant method .",
    "@xcite to investigate possible dynamical instabilities we used a @xmath24 supercell of the primitive 5-atom eutio@xmath0 unit cell ; this supercell size allows most common oxygen octahedra tilting and rotational patterns , as well as the likely commensurate afm magnetic orders .",
    "the hellman - feynman forces were calculated for displacements of atoms of up to 0.04   .",
    "the dynamical matrix for each @xmath25-point in the brillouin zone was constructed by fourier transforming the force constants calculated at the @xmath22-point and the brillouin zone boundaries .",
    "phonon - mode frequencies and atomic displacement patterns for each @xmath25-point were obtained as eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the dynamical matrices . born effective charges for symmetry - inequivalent ions in the simulation cell @xcite were calculated with the berry - phase technique .",
    "in the following we show that assuming @xmath4 is the ground state structure leads to discrepancies with existing experiments in the nature of the long - wavelength phonon modes and in the mode - plasma frequencies . because of the notorious uncertainty in dft lattice constants we investigate wheter these discrepancies can be removed by varying the unit cell volume .",
    "we find that a partial agreement ( in the mode - plasma frequencies ) can be reached , but only if the lattice parameter is increased to unphysical values at which the lattice is unstable with respect to the polar displacements .",
    "furthermore , our analysis of the full phonon spectrum of @xmath4 structure indicates strong antiferrodistortive instablities .",
    "first , we calculated the zone - center phonon frequencies and eigenvectors in cubic eutio@xmath0 ( see table  [ tab : mpf_phonons ] ) and obtained results consistent with other recent calculations . @xcite as we mentioned above , in ref .",
    "it was suggested that the to1 mode is mainly slater type , based on the observation that the measured value of the mode - plasma frequency for this mode is in the same range as for typical ferroelectric perovskites with active b - site sublattices such as batio@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite in contrast to the suggestion made in ref .",
    ", however , our analysis of the mode eigenvectors shows that the low - energy to1 mode has a rather high contribution from eu displacements , rather than being a straightforward slater mode . in table",
    "[ tab : mode_decomposition ] we decompose our calculated eigendisplacements of atoms in the to1 and to2 modes ( calculated at the experimental lattice constant ) into the slater , last and axe modes discussed in ref .  .",
    "in addition to providing a comparison with the earlier interpretation , such a decomposition provides information on the relative activities of the a- and b - site cations , and correspondingly the role of the two cationic sublattices , in the ferroelectric transition .",
    "our analysis shows that both the to1 and to2 eigenvectors have in fact similar contributions from the slater and last modes .",
    "for the to1 mode we find that the slater- and last - like displacements are in phase , whereas they are out of phase for the to2 mode .",
    "this leads to a significant difference in the observed , as well as calculated ( see below ) , values of the mode - plasma frequencies for both modes .",
    "( color online ) schematic diagrams @xcite of the atomic displacements in ( a ) slater mode , in which the b - site cation moves in the opposite direction from the rigid oxygen octahedral cage ; ( b ) last mode , in which the a - site cation moves opposite to the rigid bo@xmath9 cage , and ( c ) axe mode , in which the apical oxygens move opposite to the in - plane oxygens and the a- and b - site cations do not participate ; a deformation of the oxygen cage results . ]",

    "eigenvectors are normalized to unity : @xmath37 we used the born effective charges of 2.63@xmath38 for eu , 7.46@xmath38 for ti , -2.18@xmath38 for o@xmath39 and -5.74@xmath38 for o@xmath40 which we calculated at the experimental lattice constant of 3.90  in our calculation of the mode - plasma frequencies .",
    "interestingly , our calculated mode - plasma frequencies ( table  [ tab : mpf_phonons ] ) match well with the experimental values in the high temperature ( @xmath41  k ) range , but are markedly different from the low temperature experimental values ( see figure  5 of ref .  ) .",
    "since our dft calculations do not include thermal effects , particularly the strong hardening of the soft mode found with increasing temperature in eutio@xmath0 , we expect them instead to match the low temperature values .",
    "as we saw earlier , the soft mode eigenvectors show significant volume dependence . therefore , to check whether the discrepancy lies in our choice of unit cell volume , we investigated the volume dependence of the key quantities entering eqn .",
    "we found that the born effective charges are largely insensitive to the volume : for values of the lattice constant @xmath42 between 3.8    and 4.0   the born effective charges change from 2.68 to 2.61@xmath38 for eu , from 7.46 to 7.49@xmath38 for ti , from -2.26 to -2.13@xmath38 for o@xmath39 , and from -5.69 to -5.83@xmath38 for o@xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the changes in mode - plasma frequencies must be caused by the changes in the mode eigenvectors .",
    "next , we varied the lattice parameter to see if we could obtain good agreement between the calculated and low temperature experimental values of the mpfs .",
    "in fact we found good agreement only by increasing @xmath42 to 3.95   . from table",
    "[ tab : mode_decomposition ] we can see that at @xmath43    the to1 mode is predominantly of slater - type , while the to2 mode has last character .",
    "however , the slater mode becomes imaginary , indicating a polar structural instability not observed experimentally in eutio@xmath0 under normal conditions .",
    "moreover , increasing the lattice parameter to 3.95    is clearly not a physically reasonable choice  the lattice constant at low temperature ( our dft results correspond to 0  k ) should be _ smaller _ than that at room or higher temperature because of thermal expansion of the lattice .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the observed discrepancy between the measured low - temperature mpfs and the calculated values is not due to an inappropriate choice of the lattice parameter in our calculations .",
    "next we explore further the low - temperature structural properties of eutio@xmath0 in attempt to explain the discrepancy .",

    "first we look at the frequency of the soft to1 mode ( see table  [ tab : mpf_phonons ] ) .",
    "our calculated values are 107  @xmath12 and 128  @xmath12 for @xmath1 ( the symmetry lowering splits the to1 mode into one doubly degenerate and one singly degenerate @xmath47 polarized mode ) , 80  @xmath12 and 124  @xmath12 ( @xmath3 ) and 98 to 131  @xmath12 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the experimental value is 82  @xmath12 , suggesting that the @xmath3 structure is most likely .",
    "we note , however , that the soft - mode frequency is very sensitive to the volume of the structure and small changes in choice of volume ( gga versus experimental for example ) can strongly change the predicted values . regarding the mode plasma frequencies of this mode ,",

    "note that the relatively large mode splittings that we obtain for to1 modes in the lower symmetry structures could explain the experimentally observed large peak width in the imaginary component of the complex dielectric function ( see figure  3b in ref .  ) when two modes with lifted degeneracy are fitted as one mode .    for completeness",
    ", we also list in tables  [ tab : mpf_phonons ] and [ tab : mpf_phonons_imma ] our calculated frequencies and mode plasma frequencies of the to2- and to4-like modes .",
    "there are no striking differences that provide persuasive evidence for one structure over another . in the @xmath1 structure ,",
    "the splitting of the to2 mode , which is caused by the symmetry lowering , is small ( see modes  3 and  4 in table  [ tab : mpf_phonons ] ) .",
    "however the mode - plasma frequencies of the symmetry - split to2 modes are significantly different : mode  3 consists mainly of out - of - phase shifts of eu and ti atoms , without oxygen contribution , whereas the @xmath47-axis - polarized mode 4 has non - zero oxygen displacements which reduce the relative shifts of the ti atoms , resulting in a lower dipole for this mode .",
    "the average value of the mode - plasma frequencies for these three modes is @xmath80  @xmath12 , which is significantly lower than the corresponding value in the @xmath4 structure ( 925  @xmath12 ) but still much higher than experimental one ( @xmath81  @xmath12 ) .",
    "the average value of the mode - plasma frequency for the to4 mode ( modes 8 and 9 ) is 727  @xmath12 , compared with 820  @xmath12 for the reference @xmath4 structure . in the @xmath3 phase the to2 mode also splits by a small amount ( 7  @xmath12 ) with average mode - plasma - frequency of 704  @xmath12 , and the to4 mode averaged mode - plasma frequency is 734  @xmath12 ; both values are similar to those of the @xmath1 structure . like in the @xmath1 structure ,",
    "mode  1 is built by eu displacements against oxygen cage , with small in - phase contribution of ti sublattice .",
    "the eigenvectors are also similar to those of the @xmath4 and @xmath1 structures . in the @xmath2 structure (",
    "see table  [ tab : mpf_phonons_imma ] ) , the wavenumbers of the to2-group are in the range 154 - 159  @xmath12 , and those of the to4-group are in the range 516 - 537  @xmath12 . as in the @xmath3 structure , modes in the range 237 - 283  @xmath12 are activated and should be observed as a doublet with a splitting of @xmath82  @xmath12 .",
    "one interesting observation is the presence of an ir - active mode with frequency @xmath60419  @xmath12 in all three structures ( mode  7 in table  [ tab : mpf_phonons ] and 18 - 19 in table  [ tab : mpf_phonons_imma ] ) .",
    "this two - fold degenerate mode ( it is a doublet in the low - symmetry @xmath2 structure ) has a relatively low mode - plasma frequency of 250  @xmath12 ( and , correspondingly , a low oscillator strength ) .",
    "the eigenvector of this mode shows that this vibration originates from the out - of - phase displacements of ti atoms in the neighboring sublattices .",
    "however , the atomic displacements are not collinear , which leads to an uncompensated dipole in the plane , orthogonal to the @xmath47-axis .",
    "a mode with a similar frequency ( @xmath60430  @xmath12 ) is observed at low temperatures in the experimental ir reflectivity data ( see figure  2 in ref .  ) . the fact that experimentally this mode is observable only at low temperatures gives an additional indication that it could be a fingerprint of the antiferrodistortive phase transition .    to make the comparison with the available experimental data easier ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpf_compare ] the calculated and experimental mode - plasma frequencies as a function of wavenumber .",
    "clearly the calculated values for the @xmath4 structure are strikingly different from the experimental values providing further evidence that this is unlikely to be the ground state structure .",
    "it remains difficult to distinguish between the @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 structures which all show similarly good agreement with current experimental data .",
    "our predicted differences in the degeneracies and ordering of the components of the to1 and to2 modes , could in principle be distinguished experimentally using polarized optical spectroscopy on single crystals .",
    "strong magneto - structural coupling and multiferroic effects were predicted previously for @xmath4 eutio@xmath0 @xcite ; here we investigate whether such behavior persists in our newly predicted tilted ground - state structures .",
    "indeed , we find that constraining the spins to be aligned ferromagnetically decreases the soft - mode wavenumber by @xmath607  @xmath12 for all three tilted structures ; this is the same as previously calculated for the @xmath4 structure@xcite ( 7  @xmath12 ) , and close to the value estimated from the low - temperature ir reflectivity spectra at different magnetic fields ( 3  @xmath12 ) .",
    "@xcite we obtain a decrease of about 2  @xmath12 for all modes belonging to the to2 group .",
    "the frequency of the to4 axe mode is almost insensitive to the magnetic ordering .",
    "the modes corresponding to tilting of the oxygen octahedra , on the other hand , show strong magneto - phonon coupling , since they cause changes in the eu - o - eu angles which in turn strongly modify the superexchange pathways between the magnetic ions .",
    "these modes are listed in table  [ tab : mpf_phonons ] as mode  5 .",
    "we find that ferromagnetic constraint on the eu spins hardens this mode in the @xmath1 structure from 164  @xmath12 to 218  @xmath12 , whereas in the @xmath3 structure it is softened by 17  @xmath12 .",
    "since the tilt mode is not polar , however , the dielectric function is not affected .",
    "finally we mention that shvartsman _",
    "et al _ @xcite recently measured an unusual off - diagonal magnetoelectric coupling in eutio@xmath0 , which they rationalized using our predictions of tilted ground states . in their experiments , the applied electric field breaks inversion symmetry , allowing a dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction and subsequent magnetoelectric response analogous to that in perovskite fetio@xmath0 , which also shows magnetic a - site ions and octahedral tiltings .",
    "in summary , our density functional calculations for perovskite eutio@xmath0 predict that its ground state consists of tilts and rotations of the oxygen octahedra , rather than the simple cubic perovskite structure as previously believed . by comparing the total energies of all symmetry allowed tilting patterns , we identified three candidate ground states : @xmath48 ( @xmath1 ) , @xmath83 ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath84 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "we compared the calculated phonon properties with available experimental data for the three candidate structures to identify the most likely ground state .",
    "our calculated energy differences are two small to allow us to predict which of these phases is the ground state ; indeed a phase coexistence might be possible , and additional experiments are required for further progress . in particular , a search for the infra - red - active mode in the range 220 - 290  @xmath12 is a signature of @xmath3 and @xmath2 structures , but is not active in @xmath1 phase .",
    "also the magnetic - field dependence of the mode at @xmath60164  @xmath12 would distinguish between the @xmath1 and @xmath3 structures .",
