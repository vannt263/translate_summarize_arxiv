    "if the interpretation of the na60 data given in this work is correct , we may argue that the measurement of lepton pairs from vector - isovector states ( resonances or bound states ) can give us a detailed picture of the evolution of the deconfined system to the confined mode .",
    "recent work by ruppert , renk and m@xmath95ller contains a discussion of the width of the rho meson in a nuclear medium using qcd sum rules [ 26 ] .",
    "they are particularly concerned with how the width of the rho mass in the medium will affect the brown - rho scaling law m_^*/m_~(<|qq>^*/<|qq>)^1/2,which is the more recent form of the scaling law [ 27,28 ] than that given in ref .",

    "they result for the @xmath97 mass in matter may be put into the form @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the density of nuclear matter in the notation of ref . [ 37 ] .",
    "we remark that since the experiment does not involve the creation of high temperature matter and a quark - gluon plasma , one does not expect to see the large peak seen in fig . 1 which we have ascribed to excitations of the quark - gluon plasma with the quantum numbers of the rho meson .",
    "there are several models of confinement in use .",
    "one approach is particularly suited to euclidean - space calculations of hadron properties . in that case one",
    "constructs a model of the quark propagator by solving the schwinger - dyson equation . by appropriate choice of the interaction",
    "one can construct a propagator that has no on - mass - shell poles when the propagator is continued into minkowski space .",
    "such calculations have recently been reviewed by roberts and schmidt [ 32 ] . in the past , we have performed calculations of the quark and gluon propagators in euclidean space and in minkowski space .",
    "these calculations give rise to propagators which did not have on - mass - shell poles [ 33 - 36 ] .",
    "however , for our studies of meson spectra , which included a description of radial excitations , we found it useful to work in minkowski space .",
    "the construction of our covariant confinement model has been described in a number of works . in all our work",

    "if we consider pseudoscalar mesons , which have @xmath108 , the continuum of the model starts at @xmath109 , so that for @xmath110 gev , @xmath111 gev . it is also worth noting that the potential goes to zero for very large r. thus , there are scattering states whose lowest energy would be @xmath112 .",

    "<S> recent work reported at the quark matter conference 2005 has led to the suggestion that brown - rho scaling is ruled out by the na60 data . </S>",
    "<S> ( brown - rho scaling describes the reduction of hadronic masses in matter and at finite temperature . ) in the present work we argue that the interpretation of the experimental data presented at the quark matter conference is not correct and that brown - rho scaling is valid . to make this argument we discuss the evolution in time of the excited hadronic system and suggest that the system is deconfined at the earliest times and becomes confined when the density and temperature decrease as the system evolves . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we suggest that we see both the properties of the deconfined and confined systems in the experimental data . in our interpretation , brown - rho scaling refers to the later times of the collision , when the system is in the confined phase . </S>"
