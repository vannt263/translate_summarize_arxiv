    "rare earth pyrochlores @xmath14o@xmath1 ( @xmath15 = rare earth and @xmath16 = transition metal ) are known to present a wide range of interesting and unusual magnetic properties @xcite .",
    "the three - dimensional network of corner - sharing tetrahedra of @xmath15 ions in these cubic symmetry ( space group @xmath17 ) pyrochlores cause highly frustrated magnetism making them a model material among the geometrically frustrated spin systems .",
    "an interesting situation is encountered when the crystal electric field ( cef ) forces the magnetic spin to point in a particular direction .",

    "cef anisotropy forces the magnetic spins at the corners of tetrahedra to align parallel to the tetrahedron axes ( either towards the center or away from the center of tetrahedra ) .",
    "this causes an exotic magnetic state where even the ferromagnetic interaction between the dy@xmath11 ( ho@xmath11 ) magnetic moments becomes frustrated @xcite .",
    "the energy minimum state of magnetic exchange and dipolar interactions is achieved by two spins pointing inward and two spins outward on each tetrahedron , referred as the ",
    "2-in & 2-out \" rule or  ice rule \" @xcite .",
    "the constraint condition on magnetic spins is analogous to the disordered protons in hexagonal water ice , accordingly the magnetic state of dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 is named as  spin - ice \" .",
    "one of the major consequences of the ice rule is that a residual entropy remains at the lowest temperatures which is almost the same as the pauling value for water ice @xcite .",
    "another striking consequence is the realization of magnetic monopoles in spin - ice materials which interact through the magnetic coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "the diffuse neutron scattering study on dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 shows evidence of dirac strings and magnetic monopoles @xcite . polarized neutron scattering show evidence for a magnetic coulomb phase in ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "all these indicate a new state of magnetism in these materials which led to intense research activities on @xmath14o@xmath1 in recent years .",
    "apart from the spin - ice behavior below @xmath18  k , the ac susceptibility measurements on dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 also show a frequency - dependent anomaly near @xmath19  k reflecting cooperative spin - freezing @xcite , however the dc susceptibility or heat capacity shows no corresponding anomaly .",

    "in contrast , in dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 the application of magnetic field tends to enhance the spin - freezing @xcite , thus indicating unusual dynamics of spin - freezing in dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",

    "et al_. @xcite revealed that the 16  k freezing is initially suppressed for low dilution concentrations ( @xmath21 ) , however the freezing behavior was found to re - emerge for @xmath22 , clearly reflecting the influence of local environment on the freezing process .",
    "the 16  k freezing in dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 is considered to be an orbach - like relaxation process which involves an excited cef level for spin - lattice relaxations @xcite .",

    "considering that the spin dynamics near 16 k can be characterized by an arrhenius type behavior with an activation energy @xmath174 k which is close to the cef splitting energy ( 240340 k ) , the spin freezing is considered to involve transitions to and from the first excited doublet @xcite . since dy@xmath11 ( @xmath90 ) is a kramers ion , a direct relaxation process",
