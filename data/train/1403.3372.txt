    "understanding the ordering properties of liquid crystals in restricted geometry is still a challenging problem @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the confinement of rod - like or plate - like particles into two dimensions has great impact on the phase behaviour of the system .",
    "for example , the isotropic - nematic phase transition of three - dimensional ( 3d ) hard ellipsoids is of first order @xcite , but when the centers of mass and orientations of the long axis of the particles are restricted to be on a plane , which corresponds to a two - dimensional ( 2d ) system of hard ellipses , a continuous isotropic - nematic phase transition can be observed ( via a kosterlitz - thouless disclination unbinding type mechanism with a nematic phase exhibiting only quasi - long - range orientational order @xcite ) .",
    "the defect structure of a 2d nematic phase is also nontrivial @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , the dynamics of 2d hard ellipses shows peculiarities in the rotational and translational diffusions and in the glassy behaviours @xcite .",
    "recently , a two - step glass transition has been observed in a monolayer of colloidal ellipsoids confined between two glass walls . in the first step ,",
    "an orientational glass emerges with increasing density , which is related to orientational arrest of the particles , while in the second the system becomes translationally frozen at higher densities @xcite .",
    "the structural and dynamical properties of 2d and even 1d complex fluids have recently become experimentally accessible due to the development of nanofluidics and optical trapping methods .",
    "liquid - crystal monolayers can be prepared by confining colloidal particles between parallel walls @xcite or by spreading colloidal nanoparticles or amphiphilic molecules at the air / liquid interface @xcite .",
    "this makes it possible to study the competition between the orientational and packing entropies in restricted geometries @xcite .",
    "even the ordering effect of surface patchiness has been examined in a monolayer of nanoplatelets @xcite .",
    "the difference between the phase behaviours of molecularly thick films ( langmuir monolayers ) and that of colloidal monolayers confined between two parallel planes is mainly due to the fact that the amphiphilic molecules are allowed to rotate out from the air / liquid interface , while the colloids can rotate only in the plane parallel to the confining walls .",
    "the consequence is that the phase behaviour of langmuir monolayers can be much richer than that of 2d colloidal systems .",
    "for example , upon compression , only a few phases ( isotropic , nematic , solid ) may occur if the confined particles have only 2d orientational freedom @xcite , while several additional , tilted or not tilted , phases can be present in the case of langmuir monolayers with out - of - plane rotational freedom @xcite due to their intermediate quasi - two - dimensional character ( i.e. 2d in translations and 3d in orientations ) .",
    "therefore it is worth studying the effect of the orientational freedom and its coupling with the translational part on the ordering properties of simple model systems .",
    "a model of confined hard particles is ideal , since it is amenable to theoretical analysis and , as is well known from numerous studies on liquid - crystalline ordering , can give rise to nontrivial behaviour .    in our study",
    "we examine the phase behaviour of uniaxial hard parallelepipeds confined such that their centers of mass are forced to be on a plane , while they are allowed to rotate out of the plane .",
    "our aim is to determine the effect of the additional , out - of - plane , orientational freedom on the stability of the isotropic , nematic and solid phases of 2d hard rectangles . depending on the aspect ratio of the parallelepipeds , it is possible to study the phase behaviour of both rod - like ( prolate shaped ) and plate - like ( oblate shaped ) particles . in the case of rod - like particles , steric ( excluded volume ) interactions",
    "favour orientational ordering along the layer normal even at low densities , because out - of - plane ordering produces low surface coverage .",
    "however , the situation is very different in the case of oblate shapes , because when particles lie on the plane the occupied area on the surface is increased .",
    "therefore , steric interactions act on the plate - like particles so as to promote rotation out of the confining plane .",
    "in such situation biaxial nematic ordering may emerge in the monolayer , because both symmetry axes of the particles can be ordered at high surface coverage .",
    "we pay special attention to the determination of the stability region of biaxial nematic phase for both shapes .",
    "note that the biaxial nematic phase has been only stabilized in systems of biaxial hard particles @xcite , while our model system is uniaxial and the confinement gives rise to biaxial ordering .",

    "the aspect ratio @xmath2 can be larger ( prolate geometry ) or smaller ( oblate geometry ) than unity .",
    "the three species are labelled as @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , meaning that the longest ( prolate shape ) and shortest ( oblate shape ) axis of the particles is parallel to the @xmath5 , @xmath6 or @xmath7 cartesian axes .",

    "( ii ) the transitions to nonuniform phases could change from continuous to first order , with the coexisting density corresponding to the n@xmath57 phase located well below that estimated from the bifurcation analysis .",
    "( iii ) the relative stability of c , s and k phases could strongly change with @xmath90 . in fig .",
    "[ fig9](b ) the uniaxial order parameter @xmath47 along the n@xmath57-n@xmath32 bifurcation is plotted .",
    "it is important to note that , in the asymptotic limit @xmath62 , we have @xmath183 , i.e. biaxial ordering appears in particle configurations with a residual proportion of hard squares .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig10](a ) we plot @xmath184 , i.e. the difference between the spinodal curves corresponding to the three - dimensional zwanzig oblate particles with their centers of mass located on a plane and the strictly two - dimensional system of zwanzig hard rectangles . as we can see , the n@xmath57-n@xmath32 transition curve practically coincides with that of the i - n@xmath57 in 2d .",
    "the difference between the spinodal curves corresponding to transitions to nonuniform phases is larger for @xmath185 , i.e. , in the region where the strong oscillations in the spinodal take place . in the main figure of fig .",
    "[ fig10](b ) we plot , for comparison , the nonuniform phase spinodals corresponding to the plates monolayer ( empty circles ) and to the two - dimensional hard rectangles ( solid circles ) .",
    "the conclusion is that they are practically the same .",
    "the inset in panel ( b ) shows the n@xmath57-n@xmath32 spinodals for both systems .",
    "the main difference is related to the asymptotic limit @xmath62 .",
    "for the two - dimensional system , the usual onsager result @xmath186 results , while for the monolayer of plates the system retains a residual packing fraction @xmath187 , a result directly connected with the non - perfect uniaxial ordering ( @xmath188 ) of plates , as already discussed above .",
    "taking advantage of the @xmath189 dimensional crossover property of the fundamental measure density functional for the zwanzig model , we have studied the phase behaviour of a monolayer of rod - like or plate - like uniaxial particles .",
    "we have focused , in particular , on their orientational ordering properties . despite the fact that particles are uniaxial ( they have only two characteristic lengths @xmath1 and @xmath0 ) ,",
    "we have shown the presence of a n@xmath57-n@xmath32 phase transitions for both particle geometries . for rod - like geometry ,",
    "the n@xmath32 is a reentrant phase , since its region of stability in the phase diagram ( aspect ratio - density plane ) is always surrounded by that of the n@xmath57 phase . for this geometry",
    "the n@xmath57-n@xmath32 transition is continuous and the two n@xmath57-n@xmath32 transitions bounding the region of n@xmath32 stability meet at the critical end - point @xmath190 . for @xmath134",
    "only the n@xmath57 is stable . for particles with large aspect ratio ,",
    "there is inversion in the packing fraction with respect to the uniaxial order parameter . for plate - like geometry",
    ", there exists a single continuous transition line separating the regions of n@xmath57 and n@xmath32 phase stabilities .",
    "this line crosses the spinodal instability to nonuniform phases at higher densities .",
    "the crossing point is approximately located at @xmath191 .",
    "therefore , below this aspect ratio , the n@xmath32 is stable at high enough densities until a point where stability with respect to c , s or k phases is lost . above this aspect ratio",
    "the n@xmath57 is the only stable orientationaly - ordered phase ; at higher densities it again looses stability with respect to nonuniform phases .",
    "we have shown that the phase diagram of monolayers of plate - like particles is very similar to that of the strictly two - dimensional hard rectangular fluid in the restricted - orientation approximation .    at present",
    "mc simulations of freely - rotating hard oblate ellipsoids with centers of mass confined on a plane are being carried out @xcite .",
    "we expect to find a qualitative agreement between the results obtained from the present model and the simulations .",
