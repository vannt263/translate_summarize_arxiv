    "this approximation includes the important effect of removing neutrino weak interactions that down - scatter the neutrino energy .",
    "the final approximate model ( n - reducop - noc , blue lines ) retains the newtonian gravity and @xmath22 hydrodynamics of the previous model , but drops the observer corrections completely , reducing the transport to @xmath97 .",
    "the @xmath97 and @xmath22 hydrodynamics equations are identical . ]",
    "the general and core - bounce properties of all models are summarized in table  [ tab : models ] and plotted in figure  [ fig : bounce ] .",
    "the effects of general relativity on the core dynamics are seen in the comparison of the first two models ( gr - fullop  and n - fullop ) . the deeper gravitational well of the gr model results in a more compact homologous core at bounce ( 0.429  @xmath80  versus 0.492  @xmath80 ) with a higher central density ( @xmath98 versus @xmath99 ) and higher temperatures throughout the unshocked core ( figure  [ fig : bounce ] ) .",
    "the electron ( @xmath94 ) and lepton ( @xmath95 ) fractions are essentially unchanged modulo the shift in shock position , as are the velocity and entropy , while the pressure differences follow the density differences .",
    "as the shock moves out , the shock radius for both models ( figure  [ fig : shock ] ) remains close for the first 40  ms after bounce and then diverges .",
    "the gr - fullop  model has maximum shock extent that is 30  km ( 20% ) smaller than the n - fullop  model , and by 150  ms after bounce the shock radius is 40  km ( 30% ) smaller .",
    "several quantities reflect the long - term effect of the more compact , and therefore hotter , proto - ns in the gr - fullop  model , including the higher luminosities for all neutrino species ( figure  [ fig : lumin ] ) and the higher rms energies ( @xmath100 ) of neutrinos of all flavors after the break - out burst ( figure  [ fig : avgen ] ) .",
    "these differences are in accord with those already reported by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite using different progenitors , different opacity sets ( similar to reducop , though including nes ) , different energy and angle resolutions , and for the latter two cases , different codes .",
    "our gr / newtonian comparison is included here for completeness and to facilitate relative comparisons across all four models .      the changes induced as we go from the fullop  opacities ( model n - fullop ) to the reducop  opacities ( model n - reducop ) in the newtonian - gravity , @xmath22-hydrodynamics , and @xmath22-transport limit are more dramatic than those seen for the transition from models gr - fullop  to n - fullop  in  [ sec : gr ] .",
    "the shock position at bounce changes from 0.492  @xmath80  for n - fullop  to 0.717  @xmath80  for n - reducop  ( figure  [ fig : bounce ] ) , with the entropy peak ( upper right ) making the same shift .",
    "the increase in the initial shock mass , @xmath90 , is correlated with the corresponding increase in core lepton fraction , from @xmath101 to 0.37 ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "the larger @xmath90  for n - reducop , relative to the other models , results in a correspondingly larger region of high pressure , temperature , and density at bounce . the vigorous post - bounce shock of model n - reducop   results in a strong `` ringing '' of the shock ( figure  [ fig : shock ] ) .",
    "@xcite reported a similar ringing for their `` no nes '' model .",
    "the @xmath7-luminosity of the n - reducop  model reaches the same peak value as in the n - fullop  model , 450  @xmath96 , but the breakout burst is much shorter in duration and represents a smaller total emission of @xmath7 .",
    "the shock starts out at a larger mass coordinate and passes through less total mass before becoming a steady accretion shock . like @xcite , we see oscillations of the @xmath103-luminosities and @xmath100  ( figures  [ fig : lumin ] & [ fig : avgen ] ) just after bounce induced by shock oscillations passing through the neutrinospheres .",
    "the differences between the n - fullop  and n - reducop  models can be understood by considering three opacity changes _ imposed simultaneously _ : ( a ) the inclusion of nes / nps ; ( b ) the use of the lmsh ec table ; and ( c ) the use of the @xcite nucleon opacities .",
    "\\(a ) the effects of omitting the nes opacity _ alone _ during collapse were explored by @xcite , who showed that energy down - scattering by nes allowed the energy down - scattered neutrinos to escape more easily because of the lower absorption and scattering cross - sections at lower energies , and reduced the core @xmath94 by 15% and neutrino fraction , @xmath104 , by 30% in their model with nes relative to one without nes . the higher number of trapped neutrinos , without nes ,",
    "is reflected in the higher core @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath104  for our model n - reducop .",
    "the `` no - nes '' model of @xcite (  7.4 , figures 20 &  21 ) also shows large differences in @xmath105 , with a bounce `` spike '' reaching 32  , and a @xmath105  increase at 150  ms post - bounce of 4  ( 20% ) relative to a model with nes .",
    "this compares to a 50  `` spike '' and 7  ( 40% ) increase at 150  ms after bounce in @xmath105  for our n - reducop  model relative to our n - fullop  model .",
    "\\(b ) we have removed the lmsh ec table from reducop  opacities in favor of the simpler ipa prescription , as not all modern supernova simulations use ec rates like the lmsh ec table , which reflect the ensemble of nuclei and their excited states in the collapsing core .",
    "@xcite found that the enhanced ec arising from the removal of the artificial cut - off in ipa for heavier nuclei that occur at higher densities during collapse decreased the central - core @xmath94 and @xmath90   at bounce by 10% and 20% , respectively , relative to the ipa implementation .",
    "conversely , ipa overestimates ec where it is active and leads to excess deleptonization and stronger collapse in the outer regions of the fe - core where the @xmath87 cut - off criterion is not triggered .",
    "one such region can be seen at bounce outside the homologous core near 0.9  @xmath80   ( figure  [ fig : bounce ] ) , where lower @xmath94 and higher density exist in the n - reducop  model relative to the gr - fullop  and n - fullop  models .",
    "\\(c ) we have also replaced the @xmath103-nucleon emission , absorption , and scattering opacities @xcite in fullop  with the corresponding opacities of @xcite to eliminate neutrino - energy down - scattering on nucleons .",
    "we have previously found @xcite that the inclusion of the enhanced nucleon opacities results in an enhancement of the luminosities , but not rms energies , and lifts the post - bounce shock outward by 10  km by 100  ms post - bounce through absorption of the excess luminosity .",
    "these findings are consistent with the results of @xcite on the enhanced neutrino  nucleon opacities .      for the final comparison we change the treatment of the observer corrections in the transport equation . in model n - reducop - noc",
    "we have removed the velocity - dependent observer corrections from the boltzmann transport equation in the appropriate , lagrangian approach as described by  [ sec : noc ] , equation  ( [ eq : lagnoc ] ) , but retain the newtonian gravity , @xmath22-hydrodynamics , and reduced opacities of the n - reducop  model .",
    "dropping the observer corrections in model n - reducop - noc  results in a dramatic change in the properties of the core at bounce , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : bounce ] and table  [ tab : models ] . the homologous core mass drops from 0.717  @xmath80  for the n - reducop  model to 0.427  @xmath80  for the n - reducop - noc  model ; the latter of which is virtually indistinguishable from the homologous core mass , @xmath90 , for the most physically complete model ( 0.429  @xmath80  for gr - fullop ) .",
    "this coincidental alignment of the bounce shock positions for the most and least physically complete models should be contrasted with the lower electron and lepton fractions ( @xmath106 ) and density ( see table  [ tab : models ] ) in the homologous core for the n - reducop - noc  model relative to the gr - fullop  model , as well as the larger inflow velocities and densities and lower @xmath94 and @xmath95 outside the shock , which imply , among other things , an increased ram pressure against which the shock must propagate .",
    "the shock ( figure  [ fig : shock ] ) in the n - reducop - noc  model starts more vigorously than in the fullop  models , but does not show the large overshoot of the other reduced opacity model , n - reducop .",
    "all of the shock trajectories cross near 35  ms after bounce , with the n - reducop - noc  model having the deepest shock throughout the rest of the run .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the other newtonian models , which have larger shock radii relative to the gr - fullop  model .",
    "the neutrino luminosities ( figure  [ fig : lumin ] ) of the n - reducop - noc  model are also substantially lower than for any other model . the @xmath7-luminosity from shock - breakout peaks at 160  @xmath96  for the n - reducop - noc  model relative to the 400450  @xmath96  for the models with observer corrections .",
    "the @xmath10-luminosities of all models approaches the @xmath7-luminosities at around 80  ms after bounce , and track together thereafter . by 150",
    "ms after bounce , the @xmath7@xmath10-luminosities for the n - reducop - noc  model are approximately 32  @xmath96 , while the other two newtonian models have @xmath7@xmath10-luminosities of @xmath107 and the gr - fullop  model has @xmath7@xmath10-luminosities of @xmath108 .",
    "the rms neutrino energies ( figure  [ fig : avgen ] ) for @xmath7  ( solid lines ) and @xmath10  ( dotted lines ) in the n - reducop - noc  model follow those in the n - reducop  model closely , with @xmath109  slightly higher before bounce and at later times , except in the immediate post - bounce period when it oscillates in the n - reducop  model with the shock .",
    "in contrast , the post - bounce @xmath105  for model n - reducop - noc  is substantially lower relative to model n - reducop , and the `` spike '' after bounce is gone . after breakout both reducop  models have large @xmath105  relative to the fullop - models .",
    "as we traverse our four models , it is clear that all of the neutrino luminosities are significantly affected .",
    "the general trend is for the luminosities to decrease considerably as we go from gr - fullop  to n - fullop  to n - reducop  to n - reducop - noc .",
    "the largest variations among the models are exhibited by the electron - flavor neutrinos , with luminosity variations as large as 35  @xmath96  at 150  ms after bounce .",
    "however , the variations in the @xmath109  and @xmath110  are not as dramatic as we traverse the four models , and not monotonically decreasing as the model sophistication decreases",
    ". variations in the @xmath105 , like their luminosity counterparts , remain significant , although not monotonically decreasing with model . the post - bounce rms energies , @xmath105 , vary by @xmath111 up to 150  ms after bounce .    at 100",
    "ms after bounce ( figure  [ fig:100mass ] ) the shock encloses 1.45  @xmath80  for all four models .",
    "the most significant differences seen in the dense core are in @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( lower center ) , where the n - reducop - noc  model has generally the lowest @xmath94 and @xmath95 and lacks the peak the other models exhibit just outside their bounce shock positions , @xmath90 .",
    "figure  [ fig:100ms ] shows the same data , but focuses on the outer , `` hot - mantle '' region between the shock and proto - ns with the most evident differences being those related to the shock radius ( smallest for n - reducop - noc ) .",
    "though shifted in radius , the hot - mantle region is similar among all models .",
    "the n - reducop - noc  model shows ( figure  [ fig : leptoncons ] ) a drop in total conserved lepton number ( @xmath112 , the lepton number on the computational grid plus the time - integrated number flux of neutrinos at the outer boundary ) starting just before bounce and continuing throughout the rest of the run .",
    "this is not seen in the other models , which maintain lepton conservation .",
    "the root of the non - conservation can be seen in the integration of equation  ( [ eq : lagnoc ] ) for neutrino number over the entire grid .",
    "it results from the @xmath113 `` compression '' term and is strongest during the epoch of high @xmath114 and rapid density changes surrounding core bounce .",
    "we illustrate this loss through @xmath94 ( figure  [ fig : breakout ] , solid lines ) and @xmath95 ( dashed lines ) profiles for the gr - fullop  model ( upper panel ) and the n - reducop - noc  model ( lower panel ) as a series of temporal snapshots near bounce .",
    "until the shock reaches 0.5  @xmath80  in the gr - fullop  model ( upper panel ) , the core is still opaque , and the neutrinos are trapped . therefore , total lepton number is conserved locally , and @xmath95 is steady inside 0.5  @xmath80  during shock breakout as depicted in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : breakout ] .",
    "when the shock reaches 0.5  @xmath80 , it begins to break through the neutrinospheres , and the neutrinos can escape , causing the local @xmath95 and @xmath94 to drop behind the shock .",
    "the escaping neutrinos contribute to @xmath95 in front of the shock as a visible pulse , a small portion of which are absorbed by the cold , infalling matter ahead of the shock , forming a transient radiative precursor in @xmath94 . for the n - reducop - noc  model ( lower panel )",
    "there is no such corresponding epoch of local lepton conservation as the shock forms in the opaque ( neutrino trapped ) inner core before emerging through the neutrinospheres .",
    "the net effect of the compression term in equation  ( [ eq : lagnoc ] ) is one of destroying neutrinos , which then results in a net decrease in @xmath94 via the interactions @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "the loss of neutrinos to the compression term reduces the neutrino pulse ahead of the shock and lowers the @xmath7-luminosity in the breakout burst ( figure  [ fig : lumin ] ) .",
    "the fundamentally different behavior of the n - reducop - noc  model stems from two factors : ( 1 ) the omission of the energy derivative term in equation  ( [ eq : boltzlag ] ) or the equivalent term in equation  ( [ eq : boltzeulov / ccon ] ) ; and ( 2 ) the fact that equation  ( [ eq : lagnoc ] ) is manifestly non - conservative for neutrino , and consequently lepton , number when integrated over mass . in the neutrino opaque regions ,",
    "the energy - derivative term is responsible for promoting neutrinos in energy as they are compressed , as expected for a relativistic fermi gas and first noted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there are five extant codes that can compute the spectral neutrino radiation hydrodynamics for core - collapse supernova simulations in 2d or 3d .",
    "these codes are ( in alphabetical order by name ) : the fau - ncsu - oak ridge 2d/3d code chimera  ( s.  w. bruenn et al . , in preparation ) , the stony brook 2d code v2d  @xcite , the mpa - garching 2d code vertex  @xcite , the arizona - caltech - hebrew university - princeton 2d code vulcan/2d  @xcite , and the kyoto - tokyo 2d/3d zeus+idsa  code @xcite .    of the multi - d codes , chimera  and ( prometheus-)vertex  include a spherically - symmetric , post - newtonian gr approximation , while the others are strictly newtonian in their gravitation , hydrodynamics , and neutrino transport . @xcite",
    "have updated ( coconut-)vertex  to include general relativity in the transport and hydrodynamics using the conformally flat approximation .",
    "chimera , v2d , and vulcan/2d  transport neutrinos by the flux - limited diffusion method ( fld ) .",
    "vulcan/2d  also has a non - moment , multi - angle ( @xmath73 ) mode .",
    "vertex  uses the variable eddington tensor ( vet ) method with a closure computed using a spherically averaged , model boltzmann equation .",
    "the zeus+idsa  code uses the isotropic diffusion source approximation ( idsa ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which divides the neutrinos into  trapped and `` free - streaming '' neutrinos , with a diffusion source to connect them .    of these codes , only v2d  is capable of solving the full space - neutrino energy - species coupling of the neutrino transport that the core - collapse supernova problem requires , while all other codes break at least one aspect of that coupling to reduce computational costs and simplify code development .",
    "chimera , vertex , and zeus+idsa  break the non - radial ( lateral , or angular ) spatial coupling through the `` ray - by - ray '' ( rbr ) approximation , and vulcan/2d  breaks the coupling between energy groups and neutrino species .    in the rbr approximation ,",
    "the neutrino transport is computed as a number of independent , spherically symmetric problems , referred to as `` rays , '' which allows for the reuse of existing 1d neutrino transport codes .",
    "( see figure  [ fig : rbr ] for a schematic illustration of the rbr approximation . )",
    "rbr methods exhibit good parallel scaling for large numbers of independent radial rays , which can be evolved without communication while computing the neutrino transport .",
    "typically , in rbr codes , the neutrinos in opaque regions are advected laterally with the fluid motions and contribute to the pressure .",
    "the independence of the rays artificially sharpens the lateral variation in the neutrino luminosity and heating above the proto - ns , which results in some regions of the hot mantle being overheated and others underheated .",
    "the transport studies of @xcite using vulcan/2d  in multi - angle mode showed that full multi - d fld underestimates the lateral variation in the neutrino radiation field , whereas rbr codes are expected to overestimate the lateral variation .",
    "@xcite concluded from analysis of their rbr models that the transient lateral variations in neutrino flux and heating were not very likely to have dynamical consequences for the evolution of their models .",
    "the impact of the rbr approximation on the simulation outcomes is not precisely known , and proper testing will have to wait until one of the rbr codes is upgraded to include full lateral transport , as no extant code is currently capable of computing in rbr and non - rbr modes and there are significant differences between extant rbr and non - rbr codes in other respects .",
    "the authors of vulcan/2d  have chosen to break the energy and species coupling rather than the lateral spatial coupling .",
    "vulcan/2d  implements computational parallelism by solving for 2d - spatially - coupled neutrino transport for each energy - species group independently , with communication only after transport to integrate neutrino heating / cooling from all energy groups .",
    "the consequence of this design choice is that vulcan/2d   can not easily include either nis - driven coupling of energy groups or the coupling of energy groups through observer corrections , nor can it utilize more parallel processing elements than it has energy  species groups .",
    "chimera  and vertex  include all of the fullop  opacities plus additional corrections for weak magnetism and ion - ion correlations .",
    "vertex  also includes the neutrino - pair flavor - conversion process @xcite .",
    "v2d  uses the @xcite opacities , which are similar to reducop , but do include the energy down - scattering from nes .",
    "vulcan/2d  omits all of the nis scatterings in favor of their is counterparts , as does the zeus+idsa  code because energy - coupled scattering has not yet been developed for the idsa transport method .",
    "vulcan/2d , v2d , and zeus+idsa  use an ipa for ec on nuclei , which cuts off electron capture by nuclei when the mean neutron number @xmath87 , and overestimates it above the cut - off , while chimera  and vertex  use the more accurate lmsh ec table .",
    "some multi - d supernova codes ( vertex , vulcan/2d ) use a single species , @xmath117 , to represent all of the heavy - lepton flavor neutrinos , while the zeus+idsa  code omits them completely .      chimera , v2d , and vertex  include the observer corrections in the neutrino transport . in the zeus+idsa  code , adiabatic compression is properly handled for the trapped neutrinos , and @xmath22 observer corrections are included for free - streaming neutrinos .",
    "these codes use neutrino transport based on equation  ( [ eq : boltzeul ] ) , its equivalent to @xmath22 , or its gr equivalent .",
    "only vulcan/2d  neglects the observer corrections entirely , by solving the neutrino transport based on equation  ( [ eq : boltzeulnoc ] ) . [",
    "the transport equation quoted in @xcite also omits the @xmath118-term , which is typically considered of @xmath119 and dropped from most @xmath22 transport solutions . ]",
    "we have examined the consequences of removing ( 1 ) gr effects , ( 2 ) non - isoenergetic scattering and detailed nuclear ec opacities , and ( 3 ) observer corrections from spherically symmetric models of core - collapse supernovae .",
    "we have found that all of these changes , individually and especially when taken together , affect the progress of stellar collapse and the post - bounce evolution of the shock and core thermodynamic properties in significant ways , in constrast to the assessments made by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have computed variations in the shock radius , neutrino luminosities , and neutrino rms energies as large as 60  km , 35  @xmath96 , and 10  , respectively , across the four models considered here .",
    "omission of gr results in a less compact core and an unrealistically more favorable shock progression after bounce . eliminating non - isoenergetic scatterings and simplifying electron capture on nuclei",
    "drastically reduces the core deleptonization and expands the homologous core at bounce .",
    "omission of the observer corrections dramatically alters core deleptionization , the shock position , and neutrino luminosities after bounce , in part resulting from a complete breakdown of lepton number conservation .    the lepton non - conservation and non - promotion of neutrino energy resulting from omitting observer corrections in our n - reducop - noc  model results in a compact , low-@xmath95 core and a shock trajectory that is the least favorable of our models .",
    "the artificial loss of lepton number , lower neutrino luminosities , and the consequent lower neutrino heating rate and shallower shock trajectory may explain the lack of neutrino - driven explosions in models computed with vulcan/2d  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in contrast to the results reported by others @xcite .",
    "moreover , the changes in @xmath120 and @xmath121 , their gradients , and the entropy gradients that we see as we traverse the models shown here will change the location and strength of convectively unstable regions in the proto - ns and between the proto - ns and the shock .",
    "the lepton and entropy gradients in the proto - ns drive prompt convection , the entropy gradients between the proto - ns and the shock drive neutrino - driven convection , and these in turn seed and are seeded by the sasi .",
    "that is , the changes we have documented in this transport study have implications for all of the multidimensional phenomena we know to be important in multidimensional supernova models once spherical symmetry is broken .",
    "all of the ingredients ( 1)(3 ) above must be included in multidimensional simulations of core - collapse supernovae to ensure physical fidelity .",
