    "since the discovery of inter quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) by von kiltzing , el.@xcite and the geometry phase in quantum systems by berry@xcite during 1980s , the mathematic of differential geometry and topology was introduced to condensed matter physics .",
    "later , thouless , el @xcite found that the topological invariant ( tknn number ) which characteristic the valance band bundle over the magnetic brillouin zone ( bz ) contribute to the robust quantization hall conductance in iqhe . in this paper , we want to address the issue why and how physicists apply topology to study condensed matter physics .",
    "the first motivation may be that physicists want to generalize 2d iqhe and try to find more non - trivial states from a viewpoint of topology . among the process of exploration , zhang and hu@xcite successfully establish a 4d version quantum hall effect in 2001 , not like 2d iqhe , the base manifold is 4d sphere and replace the u(1 ) fiber with su(2 ) fiber .",
    "based on this model , marakami , el @xcite predict dissipationless quantum spin current in hole - doped semiconductors , which eventually leads to the find of spin hall effect@xcite . from that , physicists began to attention spin - orbit coupling system and developed the topological band theory to study the topological property of energy band over the entire brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "for example , physicists build some subtle and practical models with non - trivial topology property in time - reversal invariant system , such as quantum spin hall ( qsh ) state@xcite , 3d topological insulators@xcite . fortunately",
    ", the helical edge states of qsh are observed in 2d hgte quantum well experimentally in 2007@xcite .",
    "soon after that , the non - trivial dirac fermion surface states of 3d topological insulator such as @xmath0 alloy@xcite and @xmath1 class materials@xcite are also been observed from experiments .",
    "tremendous interests have been recently attracted by the study of topological state of matter ( tsm ) , readers can reference the reviews@xcite . here",
    "i want to emphasize that these experiments discoveries purely from the topological property of free fermions hamiltonian . and",
    "it s the quest for beauty of topology in physics that leads to the discoveries of these novel states .",
    "however , real physical systems are actually interacting .",
    "then , how to interpret the robust quantization hall conductance such as in iqhe if it s interacting ?",
    "actually , niu , el@xcite solved this problem by proposing a topological invariant via green function with twisted boundary . for interacting topological insulators in 3d and qshe in 2d ,",
    "wang , el @xcite propose the general topological order parameters expressed with green function . the topological property extracted from green function also are used by vovlovik @xcitein helium liquid to describe the non - trivial topology property in momentum space .",
    "using green function , gurarie , el@xcite propose a general bulk - boundary correspondence which related the topological invariants in the bulk and the one its boundary in all space - time dimensions .",
    "however , these green function description is very difficult for practice application .",
    "recently , wang propose a simplified topological invariant only from the zero - frequency green function@xcite .",
    "wang s approach to this problem can greatly help the search for realistic materials .",
    "in addition , these simplified topological invariants may be served as the topological order parameters for interacting tsm including recent proposed topological anderson insulators@xcite and topological mott insulators@xcite .",
    "another reason for application of topology concept in condensed matter physics is the topological field theory ( tft)@xcite description of physical responses of these non - trivial systems .",
    "tft is powerful due to the physical responses such as electromagnetic and gravitational responses @xcite can be read out directly from the effective theory with the coefficients expressed using topological invariants .",
    "the axion topological field theory predicts the non - trivial topological magnetoelectric effect@xcite in topological insulators and the presence of magnetic monopole@xcite .",
    "this field theory recently has been successfully used to describe time - reversal invariant topological superconductors@xcite , and some novel observable effects have been predicted . in physics , these non - trivial tfts are stem from the anomalies in quantum field theory@xcite .",
    "the bulk - boundary correspondence in tsm can be easily understood through the anomalies polynomial and descent realtion@xcite , which is related to a deep mathematic fact called atiyah - singer index theorem @xcite .",
    "the last motivation of using topology in condensed matter physics is the classification of states of matter beyond the symmetry breaking principle .",
    "how many tsm can exist in nature ?",
    "this problem has been solved partly by schnyder , el@xcite in three spatial dimensions for free - fermion systems .",
    "qi , el @xcite proposed the classification for interacting systems can be classified using chern - simons field theory by imposing on the discrete symmetry . and",
    "later , kitaev@xcite gives a complete classification periodic table or classification using k theory for free - fermion systems .",
    "this beautiful periodic table is an interesting mathematic result called bott periodicity and there are only ten symmetric space that discovered by lie .",
    "cartan in 1926 .",
    "it tells us that there are five distinct classes of tsm in every spatial dimension and only ten symmetry classes . with this periodic table",
    ", physicists can search more non - trivial tsm purposefully . for interacting boson and fermion systems , wen , el @xcite propose a general framework to classify the symmetry protected topological states using group - cohomoloy or supercohomology .",
    "approach is powerful because it describes a large class of new topological states in general dimensions .",
    "this paper is mainly focus on the interplay of topology and condensed matter physics , it can be used as a self - contained introduction of topology and their application in condensed matter physics .",
    "the rest parts of the paper are organized as follows .",
    "first , we want to give an intuitive introduction of topology mathematics as possible as we can , readers who are familiar this knowledge can skip this subsection . in the second part",
    ", we show how to apply the mathematic tool to investigate the non - trivial topology property in solid state band theory and how getting the topological observable effect from tft . during this process , we present the topological invariants expressed with berry phase connection or curvature for non - interacting systems and corresponding topological order parameter for interacting systems expressed using green functions . finally , we review the tenfold way and dimensional hierarchy of topological states of matter using fiber bundle and k theory .",
    "this paper is mainly for readers who are interested in the topology application in condensed matter physics or who like to apply topological tool to investigate the physic systems .",
    "in this section , we briefly review some important mathematic tools in this field .",
    "readers who pay close attention to the mathematics details can consult this subsection .      before introducing the abstract definition of fiber bundle",
    ", we show the appearance of it is very natural and justifiability .",
    "as we all know , the famous bloch theorem tells us the wave function in condensed matter is nothing but the irreducible representation of translation invariant of reciprocal lattice @xmath2 .",
    "hence , corresponding hamiltonian can be interpreted as a map from the first brillouin zone ( which is equivalent to a torus @xmath3 in two dimension ) to the group of hamiltonian .",
    "it means , for a fixed point @xmath2 in brillouin zone , there are hamiltonians belonging to the symmetry group required in physics .",
    "this object is called fibre bundles in mathematics .    a fiber bundle consists of the following : there are a manifold @xmath4 ( called the fiber ) , a manifold @xmath5 ( the bundle space ) and a manifold @xmath6 ( the base space ) together with a map @xmath7 @xmath5 onto @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the dimension of fiber and base space , respectively .",
    "we demand that @xmath5 is locally a product space in the following sense : there is a covering of @xmath6 by open sets , @xmath11 . .",
    ", such that @xmath12 is diffeomorphic to @xmath13 ; there is a diffeomorphism @xmath14 . in an overlap",
    "@xmath15 a point @xmath16 will have two representations @xmath17 and we demand that @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a diffeomorphism of the fiber , while @xmath20 is a point of base space . in the case of vector bundle ,",
    "@xmath21 , each @xmath22 was a linear transformation called transition function is a subgroup of the structural group @xmath23 of the fibre bundle .",
    "so we still demand that @xmath24 and @xmath25 where @xmath26 is identity . in summary ,",
    "a fiber bundle @xmath27 consists total space @xmath5 , base space @xmath8 , typical fiber @xmath28 , projection @xmath29 , structural group @xmath23 and local trivialization @xmath30 . in special case ,",
    "if the fiber @xmath28 is the same as the group @xmath23 , and if the transition functions @xmath31 act on @xmath32 by left translations as @xmath33 , the fiber bundle is called principle fiber bundle . in addition , if the total space @xmath5 globally equate @xmath34 , the corresponding fiber is trivial fibre bundle .",
    "finally , a local section is again a map @xmath35 such that @xmath36= identity .",
    "a section @xmath37 is simply a collection of maps @xmath38 such that in @xmath15 we have @xmath39 .    now it s time to describe the classification question in a mathematical way .",
    "the mathematical structural of a non - interacting insulator of spatial dimension @xmath40 is that of a vector bundle or principle fiber bundle @xmath41 .",
    "the base manifold @xmath8 of @xmath5 is the d dimensional @xmath9-space of the system @xmath42 , and the fiber over a point @xmath9 given by the space of occupied states @xmath43 ( also called valence band ) .",
    "if no further symmetry conditions are imposed ( like iqhe in class a ) , the structural group of the bundle is @xmath44 , where @xmath10 is the dimension of @xmath45 .",
    "hence , the fiber bundle of class a is @xmath46 , and the question of a insulator is a topological non - trivial or not is tantamount to asking the total space of fiber bundle is non - trivial or not . in other words , we should investigate the difference between the total space @xmath5 and multiple space @xmath47 .",
    "for the local trivialization property of fiber bundle , we know that if a base manifold can be covered with one open set , the fiber will be trivial .",
    "however , when the base space is a torus or sphere that can not be covered by one open set , the total space can not be constructed in a multiplied way .",
    "so we obtained that the obstruction to defined a global multiplied space is the transition function in the overlap region is not identity .",
    "characteristic classes are subsets of cohomology of classes of the base space and measure the non - triviality or twisting of a bundle . in this sense , they are obstructions which prevent a bundle from a trivial bundle .",
    "chern character is one of significant characteristic classes given by de rahm cohomology classes .",
    "it is used extensively in physics and mathematics .",
    "we give here a brief introduction of the de rahm cohomology group .",
    "let @xmath8 be an @xmath48-dimensional manifold .",
    "an @xmath49-form @xmath50 is closed if d@xmath51=0 and exact if @xmath51=d@xmath52 for some @xmath53 .",
    "the set of closed @xmath49-forms is denoted by @xmath54 and the set of exact @xmath49-forms by @xmath55 . since d@xmath56=0",
    ", it follows that @xmath57 .",
    "we define the @xmath49-th de rahm cohomology group @xmath58 by @xmath59 actually , @xmath58 is a dual space of the homology group @xmath60 .",
    "the duality is provided by stokes theorem , it can take a compact form : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the chain group in homology and @xmath63 is the boundary operator . in this sense ,",
    "the exterior derivative d is the adjoint of the boundary operator @xmath63 and vice versa .",
    "let @xmath64 be a principle bundle .",
    "a connection on @xmath45 is a unique separation of the tangent space @xmath65 into the vertical subspace @xmath66 and the horizontal subspace @xmath67 such that + * ( i ) * @xmath68 + * ( ii ) * a smooth vector field @xmath69 on @xmath45 is separated into smooth vector fields @xmath70 and @xmath71 as @xmath72 + * * ( iii)**@xmath73 for arbitrary @xmath74 and @xmath75 + the condition ( iii ) states the horizontal subspaces @xmath67 and @xmath76 on the same fiber are related by a linear map @xmath77 induced by the right action . in practical computations , we need separate @xmath65 into @xmath66 and @xmath67 in a systematic way .",
    "this can be achieved by introducing a lie - algebra - valued one - form @xmath78 called the connection one - form , where @xmath79 denotes the lie algebra of group @xmath23 and @xmath80 is the one - form of fibre bundle .",
    "it is a projection of @xmath65 onto the vertical component @xmath81 .",
    "another important concept is curvature two - form @xmath82 which is defined by the covariant exterior derivative of the one - form @xmath51 , @xmath83 d@xmath84 .",
    "based on the above definitions , an important property about curvature two - form called bianchi identity can be given as d@xmath82 = 0 .",
    "until now , the berry phase gauge connection and berry phase field strength in cmp have not expressed with a mathematic way .",
    "the relationship will be clear after introducing the local connection and local curvature .",
    "let @xmath85 be an open covering of @xmath8 and let @xmath86 be a local section defined on each @xmath87 .",
    "it s convenient to introduce a lie - algebra - valued 1-form @xmath88 on @xmath87 via the pullback map of @xmath89 such that @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "the local form @xmath92 of curvature @xmath82 is defined by @xmath93 in physics , @xmath88 is identified with berry phase gauge potential , @xmath92 is corresponding to the berry field strength .",
    "take local sections @xmath86 and @xmath94 over @xmath15 , such that @xmath95 .",
    "then the corresponding local form @xmath88 and @xmath96 are related by the compatibility condition as @xmath97 it s nothing but the gauge transformation in berry gauge theory .",
    "@xmath98 can be expressed in terms of gauge potential @xmath99 as @xmath100 where d is exterior derivative on @xmath8 and @xmath101 is wedge product .",
    "the most important property of @xmath98 is the following covariability @xmath102 it s also called the compatibility condition for local form @xmath98 .",
    "similarly , the bianchi identity of local form @xmath98 is following : @xmath103 can we get the topology information of fibre bundle from these local geometrical quantities such as @xmath98 and @xmath99 ?",
    "the answer is yes , due to the famous work by s. s. chern and weil , one can obtain de rahm cohomology group by the properties [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] via the invariant polynomial of @xmath98 .",
    "an invariant polynomial is defined as @xmath104 chern and weil found that if the lie algebra @xmath105 in invariant polynomial @xmath45 is replaced by curvature @xmath98 , the @xmath106 is characteristic classes called chern classes .",
    "the chern - weil theorem is following : + @xmath107 + @xmath108 is exact , where @xmath98 and @xmath109 are curvature two forms corresponding to different connections @xmath99 and @xmath110 .",
    "now , it s easy to write chern classes and chern character according to the chern - weil theorem . for example",
    ", let @xmath111 be a class a topological insulator , whose fiber is complex vector bundle @xmath112 , and the structure group is u(n ) . from the invariant polynomial such as determinant and trace , one can get chern classes and chern character with berry curvature @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "explicitly , the total chern class @xmath62 can be expressed as @xmath113 since berry curvature @xmath98 is a two - form , @xmath114 is a direct sum of forms of degree of even @xmath115 where @xmath116 is called @xmath117th chern class .",
    "obviously , @xmath118 can only be non - vanishing for 2@xmath119 , where @xmath40 is the dimension of the base manifold @xmath8 , i.e. , the physical system of iqhe @xmath40 equal to 2 .",
    "the chern character can be written as @xmath120 the @xmath117th chern character @xmath121 defined as @xmath122 the integral of the chern character in @xmath123 dimensions is an integer , the @xmath10-th chern number ,    @xmath124 & = & \\int_{\\textrm{bz}^{d=2n}}\\textrm{ch}_n(\\mathcal{f})\\nonumber \\\\         & = &   \\int_{\\textrm{bz}^{d=2n}}\\frac{1}{n!}\\textrm{tr}(\\frac{i\\mathcal{f}}{2\\pi})^n\\in\\mathbb{z}.      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath125 denotes the integration over @xmath40-dimensional @xmath9-space . for lattice models , it can be taken as a wigner - seitz cell in the reciprocal lattice space .",
    "on the other hand , for continuum models , it can be taken as @xmath126 .",
    "assuming that the asymptotic behavior of the bloch wavefunctions approaches a @xmath9-independent value as @xmath127 , the domain of the integration can be regarded as @xmath128 . when @xmath40=2 , @xmath129 $ ] is the tknn integer , @xmath130=\\frac{i}{2\\pi}\\int_{\\textrm{bz}^{d=2}}\\textrm{tr}(\\mathcal{f}),\\ ] ] which is nothing but the quantized hall conductance @xmath131 in units of @xmath132 .",
    "unfortunately , the chern character is only suitable for use in even - dimensional manifold .",
    "deriving from the chern form , one can obtain a characteristic class called chern - simons forms for odd - dimensional manifold .",
    "since @xmath133 is closed , it can be written locally as an exact form like following , @xmath134 where @xmath135 , @xmath8 is the base manifold . here , the chern - simons form is defined as @xmath136 where @xmath137 similarly , integrating the chern - simons form over bz , we can obtain a number called chern - simons invariant @xmath138:=\\int_{\\textrm{bz}^{2n-1}}q_{2n-1}(\\mathcal{a},\\mathcal{f}).\\ ] ]    for u(1 ) abelian group , due to @xmath139 ( @xmath140 is the curvature form and @xmath141 is connection form of u(1 ) group ) , the chern - simons can be simply written as : @xmath142.\\ ] ] the topology field theory for the linear responses of a topology insulator in symmetry class a or aii and in @xmath40 spatial dimensions is then given by the chern - simons action in @xmath143 spacetime dimensions ,    @xmath144 .",

    "we will give a systematic discussion in later of our paper .    in summary ,",
    "chern character is an very important characteristic classes denoting the non - triviality of complex principle fiber bundles .",
    "it sets up the relationship between differential geometry and topology , one can find the beautiful mathematical topology structure in cmp through the berry phase gauge potential .",
    "another important mathematical tool in cmp to study topological phenomenons is homotopy theory , which investigating the map from @xmath175 to the manifold being studied .",
    "this will be discussed in the following subsection .",
    "ever since 1970s@xcite , the language of homotopy group has been used to classify defects in ordered media in cmp@xcite .",
    "for example , the point defects in 3d space are determined by classes of mapping @xmath176 of a closed surface @xmath177 embracing the defect point into the vacuum manifold .",
    "these topological classes form the second homotopy group @xmath178 .",
    "another example is the winding number defined in the last subsection , it actually indicates different mapping from @xmath179 see the equation of ( [ winding number ] ) and ( [ wd ] ) .",
    "in homotopy theory , it s written as @xmath180 .",
    "it indicates whether the manifold of @xmath181 has the @xmath149 dimensional `` hole '' or not .",
    "so we can also get fire bundle topology properties by investigating how many different mapping from base manifold to structure group that ca nt continue deformation into each other .",
    "in fact , the homotopy theory tells us that @xmath182 , and @xmath183= 0 for large enough rank matrix .",
    "hence , it s a rough classification principle , but one can immediately know whether the fiber bundle is non - trivial or not although do nt know the specific value of @xmath184 .",
    "in homotopy theory , we are interested in continuous deformation of maps of one to another .",
    "let x and y be topological spaces and let f be the set of continuous maps , from x to y. we introduce an equivalence relation , called homotopic to , in f by which two maps @xmath185 f are identified if the image @xmath186 is continuously deformed to @xmath187 in y.    let @xmath188 are two @xmath48 dimensional manifolds .",

    "for example , if the manifold of @xmath69 is the hamiltonian , then one can classify them by homotopy discussion as qi@xcite for non - chiral topological insulator and ryu@xcite for chiral topological insulator .",
    "the most important thing of this article is to classify fibre bundles .",
    "how many different principle bundle @xmath64 can be constructed for a given base manifold @xmath8 and structural group @xmath23 with homotopy language ?",
    "for the n - sphere base manifold @xmath195 , it can be covered with two open sets because the non - triviality of sphere .",
    "the principle fibre bundle @xmath45 can be written as a trivial direct product restricted in every open set , @xmath196 however , we need a gauge transformation to connect in the overlap region of coverings ( homotopically to @xmath197 ) , it s a map from overlap region to lie group @xmath23 , @xmath198 it is homotopically to the map form @xmath197 to @xmath23 .",

    "therefore , it is easy obtain @xmath864 from the generating function @xmath865 as the reference @xcite said , ( [ generating function of cs ] ) is the unified theory of all topological insulators , the effective action of family tree of topological insulators can be derived from this phase - space chern - simons generating function .    in summary",
    ", we briefly study the phase - space chern - simons theory generally . and",
    "all topological insulators can be well described in a unified form in this space , which contains the parent theories and their descendants .",
    "the presence of terms of topological origin in the chern - simons theory talked above are closely related to the presence of anomaly called parity anomaly in @xmath866 space - time dimensions@xcite . for convenience ,",
    "we relabel the chern - simons forms as @xmath867 and chern character form as @xmath868 in this subsection , respectively . in anomaly theory",

    "therefore , when there is a boundary in the system , the integral of the chern - simons term is not invariant on its own , rather , upon making use of the ( [ descent equation ] ) , one obtains @xmath873 this is something we are familiar with from the physics of the quantum hall effect : the presence of the boundary term appearing on the right side of eq.([chern - simons anomaly ] ) signals the presence of edge mode .",
    "so generally , the edge state can be contributed to the parity anomaly in the @xmath866 space - time dimensions .",
    "the feature of the topological insulator systems is that all of them are gapped in the bulk but also supposed to have gapless excitation on the boundary .",
    "now how can we establish the bulk - boundary correspondence by the topological invariants from their respective green s function ?",
    "the question has been answered partly by volovik@xcite and has been extended in general dimension by gurarie.el@xcite . here",
    ", we only outline the result , the details can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "firstly , let define the topological invariants describing the edge of a topological insulator in @xmath143-dimensions space - time space . if the topological insulator has an edge , translation invariance in the direction perpendicular to the edge is lost , and the good quantum number is the @xmath534-dimensional momentum @xmath874 parallel to the edge .",
    "we expect the edge to have gapless excitations at some mometum ( so the edge is not an insulator ) , the hamiltonian at fixed @xmath875 ( the last component of momentum space ) is gapped if @xmath876 is sufficiently large ( as a function of remaining @xmath877 momenta ) , and so describes a @xmath662-dimensional insulator .",
    "secondly , the bulk topological insulator with translation symmetry can be distinct by @xmath878 $ ] discussed in this section , where @xmath23 is the single - body green s function .",
    "finally , we will obtain the general topological invariants relation of bulk and boundary according to ref.@xcite as follow : @xmath879 where @xmath880 is the topological invariant which describes the @xmath662-dimensional topological insulator at fixed @xmath876 .",
    "for example , the chirality of the gapless excitation states along single edge in the two - dimensional system ( iqhe ) has a topological interpretation @xmath881,\\ ] ] where @xmath882 and @xmath883 are right movers and left movers gapless states along the edge . in general , eq.([bulk - boundary ] ) is the result of as index theorem , it give the topology relation of chirality of the edge mode and the spectral flow which can be described with a winding number @xmath884 in a semi - infinity system .",
    "eq.([bulk - boundary ] ) is also called index theorem by volovik@xcite , it is really close to as index theorem , and which bridges the bulk - boundary correspondence of the topological insulator .",
    "the classification of the ground state bundles is a significant issues for physics , which has been obtained through k - theory@xcite or a nonlinear @xmath885 model of disordered fermions@xcite .",
    "recently , ryu.@xcite classifies topological states via gauge anomalies or axial anomalies and propose this method can be described the interacting fermions system . in summary , they establish the period-2 for complex case of fermions system and period-8 for real case pattern of correlations from different sides , but all of them underly the mechanism of periodic table of tsms is an interesting mathematic result called bott periodicity theorem .",
    "the manifold of ground - state of various symmetry is nothing but the ten symmetry spaces discovered by @xmath369lie cartan in 1926 . in physics , altland and",
    "zirnbauer @xcite recognized that there is a one - to - one correspondence between single - particle hamiltonian and the set of symmetric spaces .    in this subsection",
    ", we will classify all non - trivial tsms in various space dimensions by topology k - theory .",
    "and we establish the periodic table [ table2 ] of tsms from a more physical way closely by ref@xcite and ref@xcite , but we interpret this classification more `` topology '' . in the following ,",
    "we firstly introduce the classification for @xmath364 case for simplicity , and establish the classifying spaces more physical .",
    "the topology relation of classifying spaces are investigated by minimal geodesic and loop space discussion .",
    "we will show the ten symmetric classifying spaces can naturally come up in cmp under some physical symmetries such as time - reversal , @xmath886 symmetry and conjugation symmetry .",
    "next we consider the more realistic system of @xmath887 dimensional free fermion systems .",
    "we obtain the classification of different models such as continuum model with base manifold @xmath128 or band insulator model with base manifold @xmath497 using topology k - theory .",
    "after that , we give the physical interpretation of the classification by studying the properties of mass matrices @xmath48 of a @xmath40-dimensional dirac operator . finally , we establish the periodic table with kr - theory in all space dimensions .",
    "it is simple for the classification of @xmath364 case , the base manifold is just one point .",
    "so the distinct non - trivial topological states only require to investigate the topological properties of fibers i.e. , the space of ground state of gapped hamiltonians . intuitively , the difference for a given symmetry class is the occupied orbitals , or called the dimension of the valence fibers .",
    "so we should consider a system with @xmath10 orbitals in the @xmath888 limit , it is in the stable range . in this case , the zero - dimensional gapped phases are labeled by an integer @xmath889 , where @xmath48 still corresponds to the number of occupied orbitals , or the dimension of fibers .",
    "now let us firstly analyse the complex case of non - interacting fermions systems .",
    "the single - body hamiltonian of the n - orbital system is given by the @xmath890 hermitian matrix @xmath488 .",
    "if the orbitals below a certain energy are filled , we can deform the energies of those orbitals to -1 and deform the energies of other orbitals to + 1 without closing the energy gap .",
    "the hamiltonian of deformation after and before is homotopically equivalence , one can construct a homotopy map between these the `` flat '' model and the original model .",
    "therefore , without generality , we can assume @xmath488 to satisfy @xmath891 it s easy to know , such a hermitian matrix has the form @xmath892 where @xmath893 and @xmath894 is an @xmath890 unitary matrix . but @xmath894 is not a one - to - one labeling of the hermitian matrix satisfying @xmath895 . to obtain a one - to - one labeling",
    ", we have to modulo the redundancy group that makes the @xmath896 invariant from the unitary group @xmath897 .",
    "hence , the classifying space for complex case @xmath509 of the hermitian matrix satisfying @xmath895 is given by @xmath898 , which , in the limit of @xmath888 limit , has the form @xmath899 as discussed in the subsection [ homotopy ] , the classifying space @xmath509 is nothing but the loop space of @xmath897 , see the equation ( [ homotopy of path space ] ) .",
    "in fact , we can approximate the loop space of @xmath897 by minimal geodesics from @xmath245 to @xmath246 : @xmath900 , where @xmath488 is the hermitian matrix satisfying @xmath895 @xcite(note the length of the geodesic is @xmath901 . so that @xmath902 and @xmath903 .",
    "so the topology of @xmath509 is just the loop space of @xmath897 .",
    "clearly , @xmath904 , which recovers the result obtained above using a simple argument : the zero - dimensional gapped phases of free conserved fermions are labeled by integer @xmath184 . according to the equation of ( [ loop space ] ) , @xmath905 , where @xmath906 is the @xmath44 group with @xmath888 .    how to interpret the classifying space of @xmath906 in physics ?",
    "this construction can be realized by imposing symmetry to hermitian matrix @xmath488 , such as chiral symmetry , for convenience later , we denote as @xmath318 in this subsection , satisfying @xmath907 and @xmath908 . to compute the classifying space ,",
    "we parametrize @xmath509 by symmetric matrix @xmath909 , that satisfying @xmath910 .",
    "we can prove the hamiltonian satisfying @xmath895 and @xmath907 defines a geodesic @xmath911 from @xmath912 to @xmath913 .",
    "in fact , the loops remain in the space of @xmath509 because of @xmath914 , and @xmath915 .",
    "so , the classifying space @xmath906 is nothing but the loop space of @xmath509 .",
    "actually , we can construct the form of hamiltonian explicitly as ref@xcite @xmath916 where unitary group @xmath917 ( @xmath918 and @xmath919 are hermitian matrices ) makes the @xmath318 invariant . from the form of ( [ c1 ] ) , we know its",
    "positive and negative eigenvalues are paired , which is the reflection of chiral symmetry .",
    "we see that space @xmath906 is @xmath920 . from the unitary bott periodic theorem in subsection [ homotopy ] ,",
    "we know there are only two kinds of classifying spaces for complex cases , @xmath509 and @xmath906 .",
    "therefore , we can classify all complex ground - state gapped fermions systems for @xmath364 according to @xmath921 the topology k - theory will be like following @xmath922 and @xmath923 , where @xmath537 is the suspention@xcite operator , @xmath82 is the loop space operator , and @xmath924 stands for one point , i.e. , the zero dimensional case .",
    "so the classification of ground - state fiber bundle on one - point base manifold can be reexpressed as @xmath925 where we have used the bott periodic theorem of @xmath926 ( [ bott of ku ] ) .      when the fermion number is not conserved and/or when there is a time - reversal symmetry , the gapped phases of noninteracting fermions are classified differently .",
    "however , using the idea and approaches similar to the above discussion , we can also obtain a classification . because we will not be assuming charge conservation",
    ", it is convenient to express the complex fermion operator @xmath927 in terms of real fermionic operators ( majorana fermions @xmath928 ) , @xmath929/2 $ ] .",

    "each such geodesic can be represented by its midpoint @xmath949 , so the space of such geodesics is equivalent to the space of matrices @xmath105 satisfying @xmath937 and @xmath950 .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath951@xcite , where @xmath952@xcite , @xmath256 is the minimal geodesic space operator and @xmath82 is the loop space operator(seen subsection [ homotopy ] ) .",
    "finally , we obtain @xmath953 , which means the topology of classifying space of @xmath945 is nothing but the loop space of @xmath954 .",
    "now suppose that we restrict ourselves to time - reversal - invariant systems and , furthermore , to those time - reversal - invariant systems that satisfy @xmath546 , where @xmath272 is the antiunitary operator generating time reversal .",

    "the space of those mass matrices is given by @xmath1067 .",
    "similarly , if there are some symmetries , the real antisymmetric mass matrix @xmath48 will satisfy ( [ mass ] ) and ( [ gamma and rho ] ) .",
    "those mass matrices form a space @xmath1068 .",
    "the different disconnected components of @xmath1068 represent different `` bulk '' gapped phases of the free fermions .",
    "therefore , the bulk gapped phases of the free fermions in @xmath40-dimensions are classified by @xmath1069 , with @xmath1070 depending on the symmetry .",
    "so we also obtain the same result as above using k - theory , they effectively cancel the actual symmetries by increasing the dimension of the system .",
    "because of the same reason , we will get the similar result for @xmath1047 .",
    "the different ways to gap the dirac point using mass term form a space @xmath1071 , which indicates the gapped phases of the free fermions in @xmath40-dimensions are classified by @xmath1072 .",
    "in the present paper we study the topological properties in tsms .",
    "we systematically give the topology mathematics required to read the later sections or subsecions . in terms of fiber bundle theory",
    ", we can give different topological methods , i.e. cohomology , homotopy , k - theory , a unified interpretation .",
    "we also add some applications of corresponding topology method now and then during the introduction of these abstract mathematics .",
    "the most important tools in our paper are differential forms and fire bundle theory .",
    "fiber bundles can give one a clear topology picture in question , and the expressions will be very simple and in favor of derivation of complicated formulas if we use the differential forms instead of tensor components .",
    "based on these mathematics , we give all integral topological invariants expressions with berry connection and curvature for any bloch or bdg equation .",
    "and we give the prove of these expressions on the sphere model , which can be easily generalize to other models .",
    "a general homotopy discussion about the 1st and 2nd descendants@xcite of topological invariants in same symmetry class and different dimensions .",
    "our approach sets up the one - to - one map between the space @xmath1073 used by qi.el and the loop space of the parent ones .    for tfts",
    ", we show the compact and topology properties of effective action for interacting and non - interacting systems . following that , we prove the topological invariant @xmath173 $ ] characterize interacting system can be reduced to chern - number @xmath145 in the non - interacting limit by performing again the integration over the frequency .",
    "the general topological response eq.([general current densitiy ] ) has been obtained , all of the topological physical effect can be read off from @xmath1074 .",
    "we also give the general topological invariants for dirac model like ( [ gauss map number ] ) , which is nothing but gauss winding number , which generalize the results obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "in addition , we show this general winding number can be expressed with hopf indices and brouwer degree using topological tensor theory@xcite .",
    "what s more , the chern - simons effective action is reformulated in phase - space , and we give the unified generating functional chern - simons action in any dimensions . finally , we review the bulk - boundary correspondence in any dimensions , which can be expressed like a as index theorem .",
    "this index theorem@xcite relates the chirality of gapless excitations states of edge to the bulk invariant expressed with @xmath884 .",
    "we give the completely classification of all gapped free fermion systems using homotopy and topoloy k - theory .",
    "the classification can be viewed as the classification of corresponding fire bundles in our points .",
    "the classification of @xmath364 free fermion systems is equal to the classification of fiber bundles with point base manifold . in this case",
    ", we only need to study the topology property of the fiber .",
    "we obtain 2-classifying spaces for complex case and 8-classifying spaces for real case from the explicit physical models , respectively .",
    "we study the topology properties and their relations by minimal geodesic and loop space@xcite discussion .",
    "these symmetric classifying spaces can be interpreted as the fiber in fiber bundle theory . in the same logic ,",
    "if we choose one specific classifying space , the fiber bundle will have fixed fiber structure .",
    "then , we only need to change the base manifold to respect model for the classification in @xmath1037 cases . if the base manifold is @xmath8 , this lead to the classification of all gapped free fermion states using @xmath1049 for @xmath1047 or @xmath1050 for @xmath1051 , respectively .",
    "finally , we give the physical interpretation about the space dimension effect on the classification .",
    "although we have studied many topological properties about tsm , there are still something interesting topological properties we did nt involve . for example , the famous fractional quantum hall effect@xcite ( fqhe ) is known a fully interacting system , the ground states are degenerate which are depend on the topology of defined space .",
    "the general states may be classified by the concept of topological order introduced by wen@xcite .",
    "there are two development direction in this non - trivial states .",
    "one route is to study this states from a new mathematic framework called tensor categories@xcite .",
    "another route is to generalize fqhe in 3d spatial dimension @xcite from topological field theory .",
    "the physical realization materials will need to be studied in the future .",
    "another point we want to mention is that , we have only studied one of the three universality classes of fermionic vacua@xcite , the other two are topological protected fermi surface and topological protected fermi point .",
    "these topological protected systems are still an active study direction in condensed matter physics , such as topological semi - metal@xcite .",
    "topology has become a useful mathematic tool to predict novel materials , better understand of robust systems of matter , classification principle and so on .",
