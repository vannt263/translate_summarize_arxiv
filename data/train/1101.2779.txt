    "delayed dynamical systems ( ddss ) serve to model diverse phenomena in physics @xcite ( prominently in optics ) , but also in other fields @xcite such as engineering , biology , climatology or ecology .",
    "more than one decade ago @xcite it was found that delayed systems with one constant delay can be studied like extended systems , and they present not only analogies but equivalent phenomena such as pattern instabilities @xcite and high - dimensional chaos @xcite .",
    "chaos in ddss is considered as a particular type of spatio - temporal chaos for which the delay plays the role of the system size .",
    "there are a number of studies concerning the tangent dynamics of systems with time delay .",
    "previous works mainly focused on the lyapunov exponents ( les ) and properties obtained from them ( dimension , entropy , ... )  @xcite .",
    "less is known about the associated tangent space directions , in particular , there are no studies analyzing the structure of lyapunov vectors ( lvs ) apart from the main one ( pointing along the most unstable direction )",
    ". correlations of the main lv were only recently addressed  @xcite taking advantage of the generic mapping of a dds into an extended system , but with contradicting results .",
    "when considering lvs other than the main one , one must distinguish among different vector types .",
    "the so - called characteristic lvs  @xcite constitute the only intrinsic set of vectors that is univocally defined and is covariant with the dynamics .",
    "however , their numerical computation is difficult in high - dimensional systems .",
    "we adapt to ddss one of the methods to compute characteristic lvs @xcite .",
    "in this paper we report on the generic properties that lvs exhibit in ddss in the large delay limit .",
    "our numerical and theoretical results indicate that the lvs ( the main one and the others ) behave in qualitative and quantitative terms like in one - dimensional dissipative systems with spatiotemporal chaos .",
    "ddss may exhibit chaos even in the simplest situation in which the main variable is a scalar and its evolution is determined by a delay - differential equation with one constant delay : @xmath0 where @xmath1 . in a lyapunov analysis we are interested in the evolution of infinitesimal perturbations @xmath2 : @xmath3 which is also a delayed equation with @xmath4 , and where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are functions : @xmath7 , @xmath8 . if the dds is chaotic an initial random perturbation becomes after some time aligned with the main lv ( reaching a stationary state in a statistical sense ) , and the average exponential growth rate is the largest le of the system @xmath9 .",
    "numerically , this is simply achieved by integrating eqs .",
    "( [ dds ] ) and ( [ tangent ] ) for long enough times . for non - leading lvs , more involved algorithms are needed ( see below ) .",
    "we focus our study on systems in which delayed and non - delayed terms are separated : @xmath10 .",
    "our results are expected to be generic for this class of models . in our study , we have assumed the non - delayed part is linear that did not revealed relevant differences . ] , @xmath11 , and all nonlinearities appear in the retarded component @xmath12 .",
    "many important time - delayed systems , including the mackey - glass ( mg )  @xcite and ikeda models  @xcite , and optical delayed feedback systems  @xcite , can be expressed in this mathematical form . in particular , we have studied numerically different nonlinear functions : the mackey - glass ( mg ) , @xmath13 ,  @xcite ; and the nonlinear function @xmath14 that appears in some optical cryptosystems with delayed feedback  @xcite .",
    "almost identical results in qualitative and quantitative terms are obtained for these two systems .",
    "therefore , for the sake of brevity , we choose to present the results only for the mg model , also used in @xcite .    in our simulations",
    "we have integrated numerically eq .",
    "( [ dds ] ) using a third - order adams - bashforth - moulton predictor - corrector method  @xcite , while linear equations , _ e.g. _  ( [ tangent ] ) , have been integrated using an euler method with the non - delayed part integrated semi - implicitly .",
    "the parameters we used for the mg model are @xmath15 , @xmath16 and the time step was @xmath17 . in a numerical integration of a time - delayed system  @xcite , the temporal discretization makes the system finite - dimensional ( with @xmath18 degrees of freedom ) but this has no effect in the results whatsoever since an increase of time resolution ( _ i.e. _  decreasing @xmath19 ) does not modify the largest les ( and their associated vectors ) .    in several previous works",
    "@xcite it was found useful to map the dds into an equivalent spatially extended dynamical system of `` size '' @xmath20 that evolves at discrete times @xmath21 as follows .",
    "we express the continuous time as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the `` spatial '' position and @xmath24 is the discrete time .",
    "this spatial representation can be applied to both , the state of the system , @xmath25 , and the perturbations , @xmath26 .",
    "the benefit of this spatial representation is that one can analyze the dds with the tools available for spatially extended dynamical systems .",
    "we shall use the spatial representation of delayed systems here to analyze lvs and analyze the existence of long - range correlations as well as some other dynamical properties .",
    "there is some degree of confusion in the literature regarding the definition and computation of lvs .",
    "many authors think of lvs as the orthonormal frame of vectors that results as a byproduct of computing the les with the algorithm of benettin et al .",
    "these vectors are usually called gram - schmidt or _ backward _ lvs  @xcite and they span the subspaces in tangent space that , at present time @xmath27 , have grown at exponential rates @xmath28 since the remote past .",
    "backward lvs @xmath29 depend on the particular scalar product adopted for the gram - schmidt orthogonalization in benettin s algorithm ( though the subspaces they span are genuine ) .",
    "this and other undesired properties render the backward lvs unsuited to analyze problems like extensivity or hyperbolicity questions .",
    "ruelle and eckmann  @xcite noticed time ago that one can define a different set of lvs , the so - called _ characteristic _ @xcite lvs @xmath30 , that are intrinsic to the dynamics and are univocally defined ( _ i.e. _  independent of how the scalar product is defined ) .",
    "each of these vectors is covariant with the dynamics , and the corresponding @xmath31-th le is indeed recovered by either a forward or backward integration of an infinitesimal perturbation initially aligned with the @xmath31-th characteristic lv .",
    "actually , the perturbation will be aligned with the lv at all times ( hence the covariance ) .",
    "however for backward lvs ( other than the main one , because @xmath32 ) the corresponding les are only recovered integrating backward . until very recently , no efficient numerical algorithms were available to compute characteristic lvs in large extended systems .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the set of characteristic lvs by adapting to ddss the method recently introduced by wolfe and samelson  @xcite . in order to find the @xmath31th characteristic lv one has to compute the first @xmath33 forward lvs in addition to the first @xmath31 backward lvs .",
    "forward lvs @xmath34 are obtained like backward lvs but integrating the perturbations backward in time ( from the remote future to the present time @xmath27 ) .",
    "they have to be calculated using the transpose jacobian matrix so that les are obtained with the usual ordering @xcite : @xmath35 . for our time - delayed system",
    "this procedure encompasses to integrate : @xmath36 the diagonal coefficient @xmath37 is identical to that in eq .",
    "( [ tangent ] ) .",
    "the off - diagonal term has a curious structure stemming from transposing a jacobian matrix with nonzero elements @xmath20 temporal units below the main diagonal .",
    "thus , in eq .",
    "( [ tangentb ] ) , we have @xmath38 .",
    "notice that , as the integration runs backward in time ( @xmath39 ) , the minus sign in the left hand side is canceled . as occurs with backward lvs , periodic gram - schmidt orthonormalizations are needed to avoid the collapse of all perturbations along the most unstable direction .",
    "note also that , due to the delay , eq .",
    "( [ dds ] ) can not be integrated backward , and hence it is necessary to store the trajectory @xmath40 at every time step in the computer to be used in the computation of  ( [ tangentb ] ) .",
    "once both backward lvs and forward lvs have been computed the characteristic lvs are easily calculated following the prescriptions in ref .",
    "one delicate point in delayed systems is that one must make sure that both forward and backward lv sets correspond exactly to the same time interval @xmath41 .",
    "in this section we study the form of both backward ( gram - schmidt ) and characteristic lvs corresponding to the largest les , their localization properties , and the existence of long - range correlations .",
    "lvs are strong localized objects , therefore , like in refs .",
    "@xcite , it is very convenient to work with the associated fields obtained after a logarithmic transformation : @xmath42 ( and likewise for backward lvs )",
    ". we will refer to @xmath43 as the @xmath31th _ surface _ due to the similarities of its dynamics with that of the kinetic roughening of fractal surfaces in growth models ( see details below ) . also recall that the norm is irrelevant because a lv only indicates a direction in tangent space , and this implies that the mean height of @xmath43 is irrelevant ( only its profile fluctuations matter ) ; this should be beard in mind for the theoretical analysis below .",
    "( @xmath44 t.u . ) .",
    "( b ) difference of 2nd and 3rd lv - surfaces with respect to the 1st lv - surface .",
    "the existence of plateaus evidences the piecewise copy structure of lv surfaces with respect to the 1st one.,width=283 ]    figure  [ vectors](a ) shows a snapshot of the characteristic lv surfaces @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 corresponding to the three largest les t.u .",
    "there are 168 positive les .",
    "the @xmath48-th le vanishes , with @xmath49 . ] .",
    "we find that non - leading lv surfaces are approximately piecewise copies of the leading lv surface @xmath45 , see fig .",
    "[ vectors](b ) .",
    "this ` replication property ' is a highly nontrivial phenomenon that was originally discovered to occur in chaotic extended dissipative systems  @xcite .",
    "we also emphasize that characteristic lvs exhibit a tendency to clusterize , contrary to backward lvs whose localization sites are scattered due to the imposed orthogonality . indeed , as exemplified by the snapshot shown in fig .",
    "[ vectors](a ) , the first three characteristic lvs localize ( reach their largest magnitude ) at the same point ( completely overlapping on the leftmost region in this particular snapshot ) .",
    "this does not occur all the time but in an intermittent manner .",
    "interestingly , these structural features namely , replication and clustering have recently been reported to occur generically for lvs in chaotic spatially extended systems  @xcite .",
    "this deepens in the analogy between ddss and systems with extensive chaos in one dimension , which happens to hold even at the level of non - leading lvs .",
    "regarding the existence of long - range correlations , we find that lv surfaces have a self - affine spatial structure at long scales , which translates into power - law correlations .",
    "a detailed analysis of the spatial structure can be best achieved by computing the fourier transform of the surfaces at discrete times @xmath21 given by @xmath50 , with wavenumbers @xmath51 $ ] , where @xmath20 is the system size in this representation .",
    "for a given lv surface @xmath43 , the fourier transform of the two - point correlator @xmath52 , is the so - called structure factor : @xmath53 where the brackets denote average over time @xmath21 and realizations .",
    "therefore , the structure factor @xmath54 directly informs about the @xmath31th lv surface correlations at scale @xmath55 .",
    "the curves from top to bottom correspond to @xmath56 .",
    "the insets show the dependence of the local slopes of different curves . for @xmath57",
    "the asymptotic slope is @xmath58 whereas for @xmath59 the asymptotic slopes are @xmath60 and @xmath61 for backward and characteristic lvs , respectively.,width=283 ]    in fig .",
    "[ sf ] it can be seen that the structure factor for the first lv - surface decays asymptotically as @xmath62 , with the so - called roughness exponent @xmath63 ( in agreement with the result in @xcite for the ikeda model ) .",
    "figure [ sf ] also reveals the existence of a particular crossover wavenumber @xmath64 for the @xmath31th lv .",
    "the exponents observed for @xmath65 are @xmath66 and @xmath67 for characteristic and backward lvs , respectively .",
    "these numbers coincide with those previously reported in dissipative systems in one dimension  @xcite .",
    "our interpretation of these results is that for backward lvs the @xmath68 dependence seems to be the consequence of residual correlations with a geometric origin in the orthogonality of the basis .",
    "the @xmath66 exponent of characteristic lvs indicates they convey more information among distant parts of the system than backward lvs ; which can be understood as a consequence of the covariance of characteristic lvs as they are consistent with both past and future evolutions [ characteristic lvs with @xmath59 are `` saddle solutions '' of ( [ tangent ] ) forced by ( [ dds ] ) , see @xcite ] .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , the surface @xmath45 associated with the main lv exhibits scale - invariant correlations in the @xmath69 limit .",
    "this strongly suggests that this lv surface should belong to one of the universality classes of surface growth .",
    "the fact that the lv surfaces obey scaling laws and that systems with spatiotemporal chaos could be divided into a few universality classes , according to the scaling of the associated surfaces , has implications in our understanding of chaos in extended systems from a statistical physics point of view .",
    "moreover , the generic replication and clustering of characteristic lvs along the main vector direction in extended systems  @xcite ( also observed here for time - delay systems , see previous section ) makes it even more interesting to determine the universality class of the main lv , since this is expected to provide a great deal of information about the structure of space and time correlations of the lv corresponding to leading as well as sub - leading unstable directions .    for a wide class of one - dimensional spatio - temporal chaotic systems ( see  @xcite )",
    "the statistical features of the main lv surface are well captured by the 1@xmath70-kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz )  @xcite stochastic surface growth equation : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a white noise .",
    "the kpz equation defines itself an important universality class of surface growth .",
    "regarding chaotic systems , in many of them the main lv surface belongs to the kpz class .",
    "this includes coupled - map lattices , coupled symplectic maps , the complex ginzburg - landau model , lorenz 96 model , among others  @xcite .",
    "only lvs of anharmonic hamiltonian lattices are known  @xcite to exhibit correlations that are clearly inconsistent with kpz exponents ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "statistical mechanics teaches us that , given the fact that kpz represents a dynamical universality class , one would expect that a large collection of different systems could belong to the kpz universality despite their apparent differences . only symmetries and conservation laws would determine the universality class .",
    "that may explain why hamiltonian ( energy conserving ) systems , in contrast to dissipative systems , do not generally belong to the kpz universality . on this basis ,",
    "ddss were also proposed  @xcite to belong to a different universality class , namely the zhang model , arguing that these systems break the @xmath74 symmetry in the spatial representation .",
    "however , this conclusion was in contradiction with an earlier work  @xcite where kpz was postulated .",
    "our aim in this section is to clarify this question by means of a theoretical analysis and extensive numerical simulations .",
    "our starting point is the evolution equation in tangent space ( [ tangent ] ) , of which the main lv is the asymptotic solution . in the spatial representation ( see sec .  [ model ] ) we perform the change of variables @xmath75 , so that ( [ tangent ] ) is now written as : @xmath76 where @xmath23 is the ` spatial ' position and @xmath24 is the discrete time .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that a description in terms of surfaces instead of vectors themselves is more appropriate due to the strong localization of the latter . moreover , to relate eq .",

    "this equation was already analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite and we summarize some of its properties in the following . on the one hand , the random drift term @xmath82 gives rise to an effective diffusion term @xmath83 . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of @xmath6 in the denominator induces large fluctuations of those terms proportional to @xmath84 every time that @xmath6 takes values close to zero .",

    "these reasoning led the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite to conclude that the main lv surface in ddss behaves following ( [ h_sanchez ] ) and generically falls into the universality class of the linear zhang model  @xcite : @xmath90 that describes surface growth driven by a heavy - tailed noise @xmath91 with a probability distribution @xmath92 for @xmath93 and the index @xmath94 ( @xmath95 if @xmath96 ) .",
    "in this work we propose an alternative analysis of eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , where step ( i ) is carried out before step ( ii ) .",

    "( [ logeq2 ] ) would lead to the kpz eq .",

    "in contrast , if @xmath5 is a constant , like for instance in the case of the mg model , a diffusion term would also eventually appear far from the small gradient limit as a result of the absolute value in @xmath111 in  ( [ logeq ] ) .",

    "the lower panel shows the local derivative . for the largest value of the delay , @xmath117 t.u . , the local derivative exhibits a plateau about @xmath118 , close to the theoretical value for kpz ( @xmath119 ) .",

    "the growth exponent @xmath124 is defined as the exponent of the transient power - law growth : @xmath125 , before the surface fluctuations saturate ( for @xmath126 ) ; while @xmath127 , when saturation is reached ( for @xmath128 ) and the perturbation is virtually aligned with the lv : @xmath129 .",
    "the key point now is that @xmath124 equals @xmath130 for kpz , while it is @xmath131 for the zhang model with @xmath132  @xcite .",
