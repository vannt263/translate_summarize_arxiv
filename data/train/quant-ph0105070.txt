    "the generalization of the squeezed states of the harmonic oscillator to different systems and the definition of new nonclassical states of light have been actively pursued in recent years @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the possibility of experimental realization has also been discussed in some instances @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . however , these proposed generalizations can not be easily and straightforwardly connected to canonical and hamiltonian structures .",
    "generalizations providing a hamiltonian structure and at the same time preserving the canonical commutation relations would thus be extremely desirable not only from a mathematical and conceptual point of view , but expecially for possible connections to new physical systems and experimental realizations .",
    "in this paper we present a natural generalization of the bogoliubov transformation originally introduced by yuen to define the two  photon coherent states of the harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "this generalization is achieved by simply adding to the original transformation , which is linear in the fundamental mode variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 , a nonlinear operator  valued function @xmath6 of any of the fundamental quadratures @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the nonlinear function @xmath9 is by definition hermitian , and thus defines a quadrature  dependent bogoliubov transformation .",
    "the transformed modes @xmath5 and @xmath10 obey the canonical commutation relations @xmath11 $ ] under suitable constraints on the coefficients of the transformation .",
    "such constraints are in fact broad enough to allow for enough freedom on the variation of the coefficients .",
    "the eigenvectors of the transformed annihilation operator @xmath5 define the quadrature  dependent generalization of the squeezed states of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "such states are thus multiphoton squeezed states associated to non quadratic hamiltonian systems .",
    "they preserve some coherence properties , such as the classical motion of the wave  packet center , but in addition they exhibit nonclassical features such as amplitude squeezing , interference and deformation in phase space , super  poissonian modifications of the field statistics and of the second  order correlation functions . to avoid possible sources of confusion , we emphasize that the multiphoton squeezed states defined in the present work should not be confused with the nonlinear coherent states defined in the literature @xcite as the eigenstates of nonlinear operator valued functions of the number operator .",
    "in fact , both the physical origin and the mathematical properties of these two classes of states are rather different ; they are both associated to multiphoton down conversion processes , but the multiphoton squeezed states are generated in multiphoton down conversion processes in optical parametric amplifiers of higher @xmath12 nonlinearity , while the nonlinear coherent states are produced in multiphoton down conversion processes in the quantized motion of a trapped atom ( the counterpart of this process has also been recently studied @xcite ) .    the plan of the paper is the following : the quadrature  dependent bogoliubov transformation is introduced in sec .",
    "ii , and the conditions of canonicity are discussed . in sec .",
    "iii we introduce and discuss in some detail the hamiltonian structure induced by the transformation ; in particular , we provide the explicit form of the hamiltonian expressed in terms of the original mode variables for the lowest nonlinear function of the amplitude @xmath13 .",
    "the properties of the uncertainty products are studied in sec .",
    "iv , where it is shown that the multiphoton squeezed states associated to the quadrature  dependent bogoliubov transformation exhibit amplitude squeezing and are moreover asymptotically of minimum uncertainty . the eigenvalue equation defining the multiphoton squeezed states are explicitly solved in the quadrature representation in sec . v , and the coherent motion of the wave  packet center is obtained .",
    "results for the photon number distributions and second  order correlation functions are presented in sec .",

    "it is in general a nonlinear , quadrature  dependent extension of the bogoliubov transformation in the sense that the latter is recovered either if @xmath24 , or if @xmath9 and @xmath25 contain only linear powers of the quadratures .    to begin with",

    "will be briefly discussed in the conclusions .    _",
    "i ) canonical structure_.",
    "we first analyze under what conditions the quadrature  dependent bogoliubov transformation ( [ eq : equaz4])([eq : equaz5 ] ) is canonical . with a little algebra",
    ", we have that @xmath31=1 $ ] if @xmath32    where @xmath33 denotes the real part of the complex number @xmath34 .",
    "it is a remarkable feature that the conditions of canonicity for the quadrature  dependent bogoliubov transformation are relations for the @xmath4number coefficients of the transformation only , and do not involve the operator  valued function @xmath30 .",
    "the same is true also when considering the quadrature  dependent bogoliubov transformations generated by @xmath29 alone , or by both @xmath30 and @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , the form of the operator  valued functions @xmath30 and @xmath29 is not constrained by requiring the transformation to be canonical .",
    "the relations ( [ eq : equaz6 ] ) are such to give enough freedom in the choice of the coefficients of the transformation",
    ". this would not be true if we had attempted to generalize the linear bogoliubov transformation introducing nonlinear operator  valued functions @xmath35 and/or @xmath36 of the fundamental mode variables rather than of the quadratures .",
    "it is easy to verify that in this case the conditions of canonicity lead to such strict constraints on the coefficients of the transformation that , in practice , only the linear case @xmath37 is attainable .",
    "thus it is the requirement of canonicity that selects the quadratures as the arguments of the nonlinear operator  valued functions in the canonical transformations .",
    "we see that the first of relations ( [ eq : equaz6 ] ) is exactly the same as in the linear case ( @xmath37 ) , but it is now constrained to be compatible with an additional relation , the second of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : equaz6 ] ) , which connects @xmath20 , the cofficient of the nonlinear part of the transformation ( [ eq : equaz4])([eq : equaz5 ] ) with the coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath19 of the linear part .",
    "_ ii ) eigenstate of @xmath5 : the multiphoton squeezed state .",
    "_ we now introduce , in strict analogy with the linear case , the eigenstate @xmath38 of the transformed annihilation operator @xmath5 : @xmath39    where @xmath40 is a @xmath4number .",
    "the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : equaz7 ] ) defines a new class of quantum states , the multphoton squeezed states , which are a direct generalization of the two  photon coherent states originally introduced by yuen via the linear bogoliubov transformation . in principle , depending on the choice of @xmath41 , the bogoliubov nonlinear squeezed states include all different generalized many ",
    "photon coherent states , from four  photon coherent states on , as shall be illustrated below .",
    "as already mentioned , an important feature of the new quantum states defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : equaz7 ] ) is that , thanks to the canonical quadrature  dependent bogoliubov transformation ( [ eq : equaz4])([eq : equaz5 ] ) , they can be associated to a non quadratic hamiltonian structure in terms of the original mode variables @xmath0 and @xmath42 .",
    "in fact , the quadratic hamiltonian in the transformed variables @xmath43    reads , in terms of the original mode variables , @xmath44    the first line of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : equaz9 ] ) contains the original yuen squeezing hamiltonian , including the two  photon contributions @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the remaining terms appearing in the second line introduce anharmonicities , as they involve higher powers of @xmath0 and @xmath42 , whose degree depends on the form of @xmath41 . for instance , if we choose the lowest nonlinear power , i.e. @xmath47 , additional linear , quadratic , cubic , and quartic terms in @xmath0 and @xmath42 are generated .",
    "we are thus dealing with the effective description of a single  mode quantum system undergoing multiphoton down conversion processes ( parametric down conversion processes of higher order ) .",
    "the full hamiltonian in the case @xmath48 reads @xmath49   \\left ( a^{\\dagger 2}a + a^{\\dagger}a^2 \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left ( \\frac{|\\gamma|^2}{2 } + \\mu^ * \\nu",

    "however , if we think of @xmath20 as the strength of the effective coupling to the optical medium with higher nonlinearity , we see from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : equaz9])([eq : equaz10 ] ) that in the typical weak  coupling situations that are realistically foreseeable the dominant terms will be those associated to the lowest powers of @xmath20 .",
    "one can of course consider trascendental forms for @xmath41 , such as , e.g. , @xmath53 ; also in these cases we expect that in the weak  coupling regimes the lowest terms in a power series expansion of @xmath9 will contain the dominant contribution from the nonlinear part of the hamiltonian .",
    "it is instructive to write the hamiltonian ( [ eq : equaz9 ] ) in terms of the quadratures @xmath7 and @xmath8 , as this clarifies the physical effects associated to the different terms .",
    "we adopt , due to canonicity , the standard parametrization @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "we have ( letting @xmath56 ) : @xmath57 \\frac{x_1 ^ 2}{4 } + \\left [ e^{2r}(1-\\cos{(\\phi_1 -\\phi_2 ) } ) + e^{-2r}(1+\\cos{(\\phi_1 -\\phi_2 ) } ) \\right ]   \\frac{x_2 ^ 2}{4 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sinh{2r}\\sin{(\\phi_1 -\\phi_2)}\\left\\ { x_1 , x_2 \\right\\ }   + 2\\sqrt{2}|\\gamma|\\cosh{r}\\cos{(\\phi_1 -\\delta ) } x_1 \\cdot f(x_1 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\frac{|\\gamma|}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\left [ \\cosh{r}\\sin{(\\phi_1 -\\delta ) } - \\sinh{r}\\sin{(\\phi_2   -\\delta ) } \\right ] \\left\\ { f(x_1 ) , x_{2 } \\right\\ } +     where @xmath58 denotes the anticommutator .",
    "we see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : equaz11 ] ) that the hamiltonian contains the standard terms associated to squeezing ; however the additional terms generated by @xmath59 clearly modify the distribution in phase space with respect to the standard two  photon squeezing , and this in turn affects both the structure of the states and the observable properties , as will be seen below .",
    "in fact , the quadrature  dependent bogoliubov transformation really amounts to a drastic deformation of the second quadrature @xmath3 , i.e. the momentum in particle language .",
    "this can be most easily seen by considering the particular case @xmath60 .",
    "in such a situation , due to the canonical constraints ( [ eq : equaz6 ] ) the phase @xmath61 of the coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath19 and the phase @xmath62 of the coefficient @xmath20 must obey the relation @xmath63 , and the transformed hamiltonian reduces to @xmath64    the above expression shows immediately that in the limit @xmath65 the hamiltonian ( [ eq : equaz12 ] ) reduces exactly to the standard squeezing hamiltonian .",
    "we thus see that the canonical quadrature  dependent bogoliubov transformation is an effective description of the coupling of the system to an external medium with the following overall effects : a squeezing transformation in both quadratures and a shift in the second quadrature ( the canonical momentum in particle picture , the field phase in optical picture ) .",
    "the latter is enforced by the nonlinear function @xmath41 , and for @xmath66 it reduces to the well  known yuen shift in the momentum . of course , the shift @xmath41 is not and must not be interpreted as an external electromagnetic vector potential .",
    "instead , it summarizes the effect of the interaction with the external medium . in turn",
    ", the shift affects the squeezing properties according to the specific form of @xmath41 and modifies the structure of the stable , closed trajectories in phase space .",
    "we thus speak of quadrature  dependent squeezing and of quadrature  dependent shift and distorsion ( deformation ) of phase  space trajectories and phase  space distributions .",
    "however , before turning to a detailed analysis of the statistical properties ( photon number distribution and correlation functions ) and of the phase  space distributions we first discuss the structure of the uncertainty products and of the eigenstates of the transformation .",
    "let us consider the quantities @xmath67 @xmath68 .",
    "we want to evaluate the uncertainty product @xmath69 in the multiphoton squeezed state @xmath70 solution of the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : equaz7 ] ) . in terms of the transformed modes @xmath5 and @xmath10 the fundamental quadratures read @xmath71 \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\nonumber \\\\ x_2 & = & x_2^{(l ) } + x_2^{(nl ) } \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath72 \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\nonumber \\\\",

    "is evidently the expression for the second quadrature @xmath8 .",
    "we can see that it is made of two terms : the first term @xmath74 is identical to that obtained through the linear bogoliubov transformation , while the second term @xmath75 is the contribution due to the nonlinear part of the transformation , where the argument @xmath7 of the nonlinear operator  valued function @xmath9 has been re  expressed using the the first of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : equaz13 ] ) .    direct evaluation of the uncertainties in the state @xmath70 yields for the first quadrature @xmath76    which is obviously still the same expression originally obtained by yuen in the linear case . for the second quadrature one obtains @xmath77",
    "we see that the uncertainty in the second quadrature is substantially modified with respect to the linear case : the canonical quadrature  dependent bogoliubov transformation introduces additional terms ; in particular , the presence of the anticommutator expresses the existence of correlations between the linear and the nonlinear part of @xmath8 .",
    "obviously , the term @xmath78 acquires the same value as in the linear case : @xmath79    while , introducing @xmath80 , the remaining terms in eq .",

    "depend explicitely on the eigenstate @xmath70 through the eigenvalue @xmath40 .",
    "collecting terms together , the uncertainty product reads @xmath83    setting @xmath84 in eq .",

    "moreover , in this case , letting @xmath89 , the conditions of canonicity ( [ eq : equaz6 ] ) imply @xmath90 . if we choose @xmath41 of the form @xmath91 with the integer @xmath51 , then @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "collecting terms together we finally have @xmath94    we thus see that for large values of @xmath95 and/or for small values of @xmath96 the uncertainty product is close to the heisenberg minimum , and we can speak of states of quasi minimum uncertainty .",

    "we need to recall that the conditions of canonicity ( [ eq : equaz6 ] ) impose @xmath102    multiplying both sides of eq .",

    "the phase is made up by two contributions : a typical squeezing correlation term proportional to @xmath111 plus a term proportional to the integral of @xmath110 . as the parameters of the transformation , and consequently the wave function , may in principle be time ",
    "dependent , one can easily derive the equations of motion for the center of the wave packet @xmath112 and for the squeezing parameter @xmath113 .",
    "considering the case @xmath85 one has @xmath114 , i.e. @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and the wave function reduces to a gaussian modulated by a phase factor which includes only the integral of the function @xmath110 .    _",
    "ii ) multiphoton squeezed states_. we turn now to the solution of the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : equaz7 ] ) that defines the multiphoton squeezed states for arbitrary complex values of the eigenvalue @xmath119 . introducing the wave function @xmath120 the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : equaz7 ] )",

    "the phase of the wave function contains both the @xmath99dependent and the @xmath111dependent terms typical of the squeezed coherent states of the harmonic oscillator , plus an additional anharmonic contribution coming from the @xmath110dependent term . in the particular case @xmath124 ( i.e. @xmath125 ) , introducing the complex number @xmath126 we can choose @xmath127 , which , for the harmonic oscillator , is the condition of equivalence between the yuen two  photon coherent states and the standard squeezed coherent states obtained first by squeezing the vacuum and then by displacing it .",
    "we thus have , writing @xmath128 , @xmath129 for the real part , and @xmath130 for the imaginary part .",
    "the wave function then reduces to @xmath131 } \\exp{\\left[i\\left ( \\sqrt{2}\\alpha_2x   - e^{\\textstyle r}|\\gamma| \\int^{x}dx'f(x')\\right)\\right ] } \\ ; . \\label{eq : equaz27}\\ ] ]    the state ( [ eq : equaz27 ] ) describes a coherent squeezed dynamics : @xmath132 is still equal to the mean in a coherent state @xmath133 of the harmonic oscillator , while the variance @xmath134 coincides with the dispersion @xmath135 of the yuen two  photon coherent state . the equation for the wave  packet center",
    "is easily derived , and one obtains @xmath136    which reduces to the equation of motion for the classical harmonic oscillator when neither @xmath20 nor @xmath41 are explicitly time  dependent .",
    "therefore the multiphoton squeezed states preserve some of the basic properties of the squeezed coherent states of the harmonic oscillator . however , the presence of the @xmath9dependent term in the phase of the wave function has relevant effects on other physical quantities , in particular , as shall be seen in the next sections , on the photon statistics , the correlation properties and the structure of the quasiprobability distributions in phase space .",
    "we also note from the above discussion that in all cases @xmath110 enters only in the phase of the wave function : it is therefore always possible to cast the hamiltonian ( [ eq : equaz11 ] ) in the general form @xmath137    with coefficients @xmath0 , @xmath5 , @xmath4 that depend on the parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 of the canonical quadrature  dependent bogoliubov transformation .",
    "let us consider the photon number distribution ( pnd ) in a multiphoton squeezed state : @xmath138 . due to the nonlinear nature of the function",

    "correspondingly , at a higher number of photons the pnd of the multiphoton squeezed state stays well above zero approximately up to @xmath145 and well above the pnd of the two  photon coherent state , which is practically zero already at @xmath146 .",
    "it is also to be noted that the presence of the nonlinearity tends to attenuate the oscillations in the pnd , and we have tested that this effect becomes more pronounced for increasing values of the coupling @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , fig .",
    "1 shows that the minima of the oscillations in the pnd of a multiphoton squeezed state stay always well above zero .",
    "the explanation of this phenomenon is that the additional cubic nonlinear term in the phase of the wave function yields faster oscillations that enter in competition with the slower oscillations due to the remaining linear and quadratic squeezing terms entering in the phase . the net result is a decrease in the maxima and a corresponding increase in the minima of the oscillations .",
    "the effect is obviously more pronounced if we consider the pnd of a multiphoton squeezed state with higher nonlinearity , as shown in fig .  2 for the case @xmath147 .     of the multiphoton squeezed state ( [ eq : equaz27 ] )",

    "however , the quadrature  dependent transformations generated by quadratic and/or higher powers of the first quadrature @xmath7 are associated to non quadratic effective hamiltonians that summarize the interaction with media with higher nonlinearities ( multiphoton down conversion processes ) and we thus name them as multiphoton squeezed states .",
    "the presence of the quadrature  dependent term in the transformation is reflected in the presence of an additional phase factor in the wave function representation of these states .",

    "in fact , looking at future developments , it will be interesting to explore the possibility , that we have only mentioned here , of considering quadrature  dependent transformations generated by operator valued functions more general than the simple powers considered in the present work .",
    "for instance , considering the transformation generated by a periodic function of the first quadrature might allowe to define squeezed states for massive particles interacting with optical lattices .",
    "we should finally mention the possibility , in contexts broader than quantum optics , of exploiting the quadrature  dependent bogoliubov transformation as a technical tool for the introduction of normal modes .",
