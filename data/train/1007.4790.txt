    "<S> we discuss the works of one of electronic art pioneers , ben f. laposky ( 1914 - 2000 ) , and argue that he might have been the first to create a family of essentially nonlinear analog circuits that allowed him to observe chaotic attractors .    </S>",
    "<S> * as any branch of science , dynamical chaos theory has no definite birthdate or starting point , but a certain number of milestones . </S>",
    "<S> edward n. lorenz recognized the chaotic attractor , which now bears his name , in numerical simulations somewhere around 1961 @xcite , while leon chua incarnated chaotic attractors with a specially designed electronic circuit in 1983 @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we present evidences that ben f. laposky was able to create a family of analog circuits that allowed him to observe chaotic attractors and other trademarks of nonlinear science as early as 1953 . </S>",
    "<S> *    although laposky , a draftsman by profession , had received a proper recognition as a pioneer of electronic art , at no time his name has emerged in the context of dynamical chaos theory . </S>",
    "<S> the circuits he had implemented for generation of `` oscillons '' on the screen of a cathode ray tube oscilloscope , remain a mystery @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that some of his thirty - seven circuits @xcite had `` as many as 70 different setting of controls''@xcite and that ac - voltage has been used for the circuit feeding . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is based on the vanity press booklet with the still photos of the fifty - six oscillons , which were exhibited at the sanford museum ( cherokee , iowa ) in 1953 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> there are three oscillons that captured our attention ( figs .  1 , a - c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the first oscillon ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1a , @xmath0 in the booklet ) looks very similar to the celebrated rssler attractor @xcite ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1d ) , while the second one ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2b , @xmath1 ) looks like a multi ( in this case , three)- scroll attractor @xcite ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1e ) , a typical output of chaotic circuits which include nonlinear elements with nonmonotonous input / output characteristics .    </S>",
    "<S> ; ( b ) @xmath1 ; and ( c ) @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> rssler attractor , with the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ( d ) , three - scroll attractor , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 @xcite ( e ) , and limit - cycle regime of the hindmarsch - rose model ( f ) . while the last attractor was modified by a nonlinear frame transformation , the first two </S>",
    "<S> were obtained by a simple adjusting rotation of the original frame @xmath9 and subsequent projection on the @xmath10-plane . </S>",
    "<S> ( g ) the periodic bursting pattern , @xmath11 , generated by the limit cycle from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1c , bottom row.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the words `` looks similar '' stand here for the similarity of the attractor shapes only . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , this observation can not be taken as a rigorous proof of the statement that laposky observed chaotic attractors , yet it certainly confirms the fact that the electronic systems he used were essentially nonlinear . </S>",
    "<S> the third oscillon ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1c , @xmath2 ) provides more substantial evidence of the last statement . </S>",
    "<S> it represents a peculiar limit cycle , which , we believe , demonstrates the bursting phenomenon @xcite , a dynamical regime of neuronal activity where a neuron periodically fires discrete series of spikes , and which can be reproduced with nonlinear models only . in order to substantiate this claim we employed the hindmarsh - rose model @xcite , with the parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 . using the shape of the model attractor in a three - dimensional space @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> , we tried to find a frame transformation , @xmath15 , which maps the original frame space onto a new one , @xmath16 , so that the new coordinates of reference attractor points , @xmath17 , would maximally approach the corresponding reference points of the oscillon , @xmath18 ( see appendix a ) . </S>",
    "<S> namely , we first digitized the image of the oscillon and distributed twenty - six reference points over it . </S>",
    "<S> since allowable frame transformations should be smooth in order to preserve the topology of the attractor , we assumed the functions @xmath19 to be forth - order polynomials , and then minimized the quantity @xmath20 in a standard least - squares fashion , by varying the polynomial coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting limit cycle ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1f ) has the shape of the original oscillon , and produces a typical periodic bursting pattern ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 g ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the oscillon @xmath2 might be a fingerprint of an analog model of neuron , which was created even before the very first mathematical model was presented @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we would like to underline that the trajectory shown on fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1c exhibits a specific type of instability @xcite which is irreproducible with simple linear setups ( for example , by crumpling a lissajous curve ) .    </S>",
    "<S> our results give substantial evidences that ben f. laposky had all ingredients needed to encounter chaotic regimes of analog electronic systems and it is quite _ probable _ that he had witnessed these regimes while tuning the parameters of his mysterious circuits @xcite . yet `` science starts from problems , and not from observations '' @xcite , so that , even if our hypothesis is correct , laposky can not be nominated for the discovery of chaotic attractors ( although he certainly deserved to be mentioned in the curriculum vitae of electronic chaos ; see appendix b ) . </S>",
    "<S> but what is most exciting about the oscillon story is that the use of pure aesthetic criteria , which guide artist s preferences , had led to the selection of several aperiodic , chaotic attractor - like structures from more than 6,000 images @xcite  decades before scientists started to talk about the `` beauty of chaos '' @xcite . </S>"
