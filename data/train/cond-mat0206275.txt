    "there are many complex systems where thermal fluctuations are small enough that the temperature of the external bath , @xmath0 , can be considered zero .",
    "examples are supercooled liquids quenched at zero temperature in metastable states ( blocked configurations ) , called `` inherent structures '' , which correspond to the local minima of the potential energy in the particles configuration space @xcite . granular materials @xcite at rest are another important example of system frozen @xcite in mechanically stable microstates ( blocked configurations ) , which by analogy with the glass terminology can also be called inherent states .    the issue we consider here , which recently raised considerable interest , is to investigate the possibility to describe these systems by using concepts from statistical mechanics , as edwards @xcite suggested for granular media more than ten years ago .",
    "his assumption was that , by gently shaking the system under the constrain of fixed volume @xmath1 , the distribution over the mechanically stable ( blocked ) states would be uniform .",
    "this leads to the definition of a configurational entropy , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the number of mechanically stable states corresponding to the fixed volume @xmath1 and energy @xmath4 , and to the concept of compactivity , @xmath5 . in a similar way one can also define a configurational temperature , @xmath6 .    also in glasses , following for example the inherent structure approach @xcite",
    ", one can define a configurational entropy associated to the number of inherent structures corresponding to a fixed energy , @xmath4 , and consequently the configurational temperature .",
    "when the system is frozen at zero temperature in one of his inherent states it does not evolve anymore .",
    "however , one can explore the inherent structures space essentially in two ways .",
    "one way is by quenching the system over and over from an equilibrium temperature , t , to zero temperature @xcite . using this procedure , sciortino _",
    "_ @xcite found that in a supercooled glass forming liquid , studied by molecular dynamics simulations , the configurational temperature numerically coincides with the equilibrium temperature @xmath7 , provided that @xmath7 is low enough .",
    "another way to visit the inherent structures is by letting the system aging in contact with an almost zero bath temperature , @xmath0 . during the aging process",
    "an effective temperature , @xmath8 , can be defined via the off - equilibrium extension of the fluctuation - dissipation ratio @xcite .",
    "it happens that in mean field models @xcite this effective temperature coincides with the above configurational temperature .",
    "the possibility to introduce an effective temperature for granular media via the extension of the fluctuation - dissipation relation , was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the connection between edwards approach for granular media and the results in glass theory has been pointed out in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "@xcite it was shown that , for a class of finite dimensional systems , in the limit @xmath9 , @xmath8 coincides in fact with the configurational temperature , predicted by the edwards hypothesis .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the inherent states are visited in an other way by using a tap dynamics ( i.e. , a procedure similar to that used in the compaction of real granular materials ) , where each tap consists in raising the bath temperature to a value @xmath10 and , after a lapse of time @xmath11 , quenching it back to zero . by cyclically repeating the process",
    "the system explores the space of the inherent states @xcite .",
    "once the stationary state is reached one can define a temperature , @xmath12 , via the equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "one can then see that , if edwards assumption applies , @xmath12 coincides with the configurational temperature .",
    "this has been verified in fact for different finite dimensional models @xcite .",
    "it was also shown numerically that for low enough @xmath10 one has that @xmath13 , confirming on lattice models for granular media the result of ref . @xcite .",
    "in fact when the duration of each single tap is infinite ( @xmath14 ) , the tap coincides with the way to explore the inherent states implemented in molecular dynamics simulations for lennard jones mixtures @xcite .",
    "however the method used in @xcite only allows the calculation of @xmath15 when the configurational temperatures is low , i.e. , where all the different temperatures almost coincide .",
    "many other studies confirming edwards approach have also been presented @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we give a comprehensive view of the results obtained in @xcite by considering other models and giving more details .",
    "in particular we study here three schematic lattice models for glassy systems and granular media , i.e. , a diluted spin glass , a monodisperse hard - sphere system under gravity and a hard - sphere binary mixture under gravity . in particular , in the diluted spin glass and in the monodisperse hard - sphere system under gravity , the asymptotic states reached by the system are found to be described only by the configurational temperature .",
    "whereas in the hard - sphere binary mixture under gravity the asymptotic states are found to be described by two thermodynamic parameters @xcite , coinciding with the two configurational temperatures which characterize the distribution among the inherent states when the principle of maximum entropy is satisfied under the constraint that the energies of the two species are independently fixed . in ref .",
    "@xcite a description of the segregation observed in the binary system in term of these two temperatures is also given .",
    "in sect.s [ model ] and [ tapping ] , the frustrated lattice gas model and the results of its study with the tap dynamics are respectively presented . in sect .",
    "[ outequ ] , the same results are obtained at higher density where the system at small temperature reaches a quasi - stationary state in which one time quantities decay as the logarithm of time . in sect .",

    "recently a lattice model has been introduced to describe glass formers @xcite and , in presence of gravity , granular materials @xcite .",

    ", the model describes a frustrated lattice gas with properties recalling those of a `` frustrated '' liquid .",
    "in fact the first term of hamiltonian ( [ flg ] ) implies that two nearest neighbor sites can be freely occupied only if their spin variables satisfy the interaction , that is if @xmath25 , otherwise they feel a strong repulsion . to make the connection with a liquid",

    "two particles can be nearest neighbors only if the relative orientation is appropriate , otherwise they have to move apart .",
    "since in a frustrated loop the spins can not satisfy all interactions , in this model particle configurations in which a frustrated loop is fully occupied are not allowed .",
    "the frustrated loops in the model are the same of the spin glass model and correspond in the liquid to those loops which , due to geometrical hindrance , can not be fully occupied by the particles . in @xmath27 @xcite , the model has a maximum density @xmath28 , and a transition at @xmath29 where the non - linear spin susceptibility diverges .    in the present paper , the @xmath27 cubic frustrated lattice gas model with @xmath30 finite",

    "in conclusion , in the context of models for glasses and granular materials we have shown that the stationary ( or quasi - stationary ) state reached by the system subject to a tap dynamics among its inherent states is genuinely a thermodynamic state , which can be well described by edwards assumption of an uniform measure , i.e. , a probability distribution obtained assuming the validity of the principle of maximum entropy .",
    "in particular in the frustrated lattice gas model and in the system of monodisperse hard - spheres under gravity we have found that the observables recorded during different tap sequences ( different amplitude and duration of taps ) fall on universal master curves when plotted as a function of a single thermodynamic parameter .",
    "these curves turn out to coincide with those predicted , within the described statistical mechanics approach , by the generalized gibbs distribution of eq.([pr ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the results obtained in a system under gravity made of particles of two different sizes show that a single thermodynamic parameter is not enough to describe the macrostates , and two configurational temperatures are instead necessary . in general , for a more complex system one might expect more constraints to be imposed , leading to more than two thermodynamic parameters @xcite . in practice , the criteria to determine a priori the required parameters can be not easily accessible .",
    "however more recently we have extended data regarding the hard - sphere binary mixture for very low energy @xcite and found that only one thermodynamical parameter is necessary to describe the stationary state .",
    "this seems to be a general feature @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , a statistical mechanics approach with only one thermodynamical variable may be feasible for low energy .",
