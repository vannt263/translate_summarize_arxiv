    "several methods have been proposed .",
    "the standard way is to use the spin pumping effect in ferromagnetic - normal metal junctions .",

    "this spin pumping effect is widely used in experiments .",
    "a second technique is non - local spin injection in ferromagnetic - normal metal junctions .",
    "@xcite in this case , a spin - polarized current is induced in a ferromagnet by applying an electric field .",
    "the spin - polarized current results in a spin imbalance at the interface that gives rise to a diffusive flow of spin without a charge current in the normal metal . a third technique is to use the spin hall effect ,  @xcite where the spin current flows in a transverse direction to an applied electric voltage in the presence of a spin - orbit interaction .",
    "very recently , the spin seebeck effect was discovered enabling a generation of a spin current from thermal gradients in ferromagnets .",
    "@xcite thus , spin current generation can be realized by several mechanisms using various magnetic , electric , thermoelectric , and quantum relativistic ( spin - orbit ) effects .",
    "in contrast , direct measurement of spin currents is still an open issue .",
    "spin current detection has so far been performed by measuring subsidiary observables that arise from spin currents .",
    "the first such observation was accomplished by kato _",
    "_  @xcite by measuring optically the spin accumulation that appears as a result of spin currents at the edges of samples ( gaas and ingaas ) in spin hall systems .",
    "the critical issue , however , is that spin currents are not conserved .",
    "therefore , spin accumulation and spin currents are not in direct correspondence , in sharp contrast to charge currents that are conserved .",
    "the inverse spin hall effect was proposed as a method for measuring spin currents electrically .",
    "@xcite the idea is based on the argument that spin currents flowing in the presence of spin - orbit interactions induce an electric voltage through the inverse process associated with the spin hall effect .",

    "@xcite    theoretical justification for the inverse spin hall effect has been carried out on various systems .",
    "@xcite takahashi and maekawa  @xcite investigated the inverse spin hall effect because of nonlocal spin injection in ferromagnetic - nonmagnetic metal junctions , and demonstrated phenomenologically the relationship between charge current ( @xmath0 ) and spin current ( @xmath1 ) , i.e. , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the spin polarization direction .",
    "generation of the charge current by magnetization dynamics in magnetic junctions was studied phenomenologically by wang _",

    "@xcite and xiao _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite by using microscopic theory , the direct connection between spin currents pumped by magnetization dynamics and induced charge currents was revealed in disordered metallic systems  @xcite and in disordered rashba systems .",
    "@xcite the result for metallic systems followed phenomenological predictions , @xmath2 , whereas pumped charge currents in rashba systems deviated from this simple relation .",
    "the naive picture that all spin currents are converted into charge currents is , therefore , incorrect .",
    "what has been missing in this picture is the distinction between spin currents induced by some effective field and those arising from spin accumulation diffusion .",
    "the first one , local spin current , is a contribution proportional to a local value of the magnetization texture .",
    "the other contribution is a diffusive spin current which contains a long - range diffusion factor .",
    "as we will show below , this difference is crucial in discussing the inverse spin hall effect but can not be addressed by phenomenological schemes . for applications ,",
    "these two spin currents need to be considered separately since the direction of the local ( field - driven ) spin current is controlled by the field , while there is no way to control the direction of the diffusive spin current .",
    "the first aim of the present paper is to study these spin currents arising from magnetization dynamics ( spin pumping effect ) in the absence of spin - orbit interactions by providing a fully quantum - mechanical treatment of the conduction electrons .",
    "( we note that spin - orbit interactions are not essential in discussing the spin pumping effect . )",
    "generation of spin currents because of a precessing magnetization was first studied by silsbee _",

    "@xcite they showed that this precession generates an accumulation of spin at the interface between ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic domains and that the spin diffusion , i.e. , spin current , arises from this spin accumulation .",

    "@xcite argued that the pumped spin current can be expressed in the form @xmath4 , introducing phenomenological parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 are proportional to their mixing conductances and @xmath7 denotes the magnetization direction ) .",
    "they assumed that the spin - flip relaxation rate is sufficiently larger than their spin injection rate and the spin accumulation does not build up at the interface .",
    "therefore , their pumping mechanism is different from that of silsbee _ et al . _",
    "later , brataas _ et al .",
    "_ considered the effect of a back flow arising from the spin accumulation at the interface .",
    "@xcite there have been , therefore , predicted two types of spin currents : one arising from a nonlocal diffusion of the spin accumulation and the other a local contribution driven by an effective field .",
    "we show in the present paper that the diffusive spin current originating from spin accumulation dominates in the case of the slow - varying magnetization ( disordered system ) .",

    "the second aim of the present paper is to clarify the spin - charge conversion mechanism based on microscopic theory and derive its conversion formula . by calculating a spin current in the absence of spin - orbit interactions and a charge current with spin - orbit interactions ( treated as linear - order perturbation )",
    ", we will reveal the spin - to - charge current conversion phenomena via the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "we will demonstrate that this conversion mechanism differs depending on the type of spin - orbit interaction , smoothness of the magnetization profile , and the disorder ( electron mean free path ) .",
    "in particular , the origin of spin currents , namely , whether spin currents are generated by effective fields or arise from spin accumulation , turns out to be crucially important for spin - charge conversion efficiency . depending on the spin - orbit interaction causing the conversion",
    ", we consider two cases : rashba spin - orbit interactions and spin - orbit interaction originating from random impurity scattering in metals . in the former , the dominant spin current is converted into a charge current . in contrast , in the latter , the correlation between the dominant spin current and pumped charge currents is very weak . instead , the local spin current ( a small fraction of the pumped spin current ) is converted .",
