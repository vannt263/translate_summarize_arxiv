    "elliptic problems appear naturally in physics mainly in two situations : as equations which describe equilibrium ( for example , stationary solutions in general relativity ) and as constraints for the evolutions equations ( for example , constraint equations in electromagnetism and general relativity ) .",
    "in addition , in general relativity they appear often as gauge conditions for the evolutions equations .",
    "the model for all elliptic equations is the laplace equation .",
    "let us consider the dirichlet boundary value problem for this equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a bounded , smooth , domain in @xmath2 with boundary @xmath3 ; @xmath4 are smooth functions and @xmath5 is the laplace operator in @xmath2 .",
    "it is a well known result that for every source @xmath6 and every boundary value @xmath7 there exist a unique , smooth , solution @xmath8 of .",
    "we would like to generalize equations for more general operators and more general boundary conditions .",
    "the first step in this generalization is given by the neumann problem @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the outward unit normal to @xmath3 , the index @xmath11 takes values @xmath12 and @xmath13 denotes partial derivative with respect to the @xmath2 coordinate @xmath14 .",
    "there exist two main differences between the neumann and the dirichlet problem : ( i ) the solution to the neumann problem is not unique , for a given solution we can add a constant and obtain a new solution .",
    "moreover , the constants are the only solutions of the homogeneous problem @xmath15 to see this , we multiply by @xmath8 and use the divergence theorem @xmath16 ( ii ) the source @xmath6 can not be arbitrary .",
    "we integrate in @xmath1 equation to obtain a necessary condition for @xmath6 @xmath17    the following theorem says that is also a sufficient condition for the existence of solution .",
    "a solution @xmath8 to the neumann problem exists if and only if @xmath6 satisfies @xmath18 two different solutions differ by a constant .",
    "the fact that the solution is not unique in the neumann problem does not affect the physics of the model that is described by these equations .",

    "the electric field @xmath19 is invariant under the transformation @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a constant .",
    "we will see in section [ sec : es ] that something similar happens for the constraint equations in general relativity .",
    "we have seen that the neumann problem has not a unique solution .",
    "if we include lower order terms in the operator , the dirichlet problem will not have a unique solution either .",
    "for example , for some constants @xmath24 ( the eigenvalues ) the following equations have a non - trivial solutions ( eigenfunctions ) @xmath25    one of the main ideas in the theory of partial differential equations is that many relevant properties of the equations depends only on the principal part , that is on the terms with highest derivatives .",
    "the previous examples show that uniqueness does not depend only on the principal part .",
    "motivated by the neumann problem , we write the following the two main properties of elliptic equations    * the solutions space of the homogeneous problem ( i.e. , when we set the source @xmath6 and the boundary values @xmath7 equal to zero ) is finite dimensional . * the solution will exist if and only if the sources satisfy a finite number of conditions .",

    "we have already seen that these properties depend on the lower order terms . for the particular case of second order elliptic operators ,",
    "there exist an important tool that can give uniqueness and a characterization of the null space for certain kind of lower order terms : the _ maximum principle_. there exist many useful versions of the maximum principle ( see for example @xcite ) , here we mention a particular simple case , which can be generalize to other situations as we will see .",

    "we observe that all solutions of the form @xmath324 with arbitrary analytic @xmath6 , vanish on the boundary of the unit disk .",
    "thus the problem of finding a solution with dirichlet boundary condition is not well defined .    in the witten equation",

    ", einstein equations can be reduced to an elliptic system . moreover ,",
    "the inner boundary conditions satisfy the complementing condition .",
    "this result was proved in @xcite and it was used to prove an existence result for the non linear problem .",
    "see also @xcite for a different kind of boundary conditions for the static case .      in order to present a general result for properly elliptic systems with boundary conditions that satisfy the complementing condition",
    "we need to reformulate in a more precise way properties ( i)-(ii ) . for a given operator @xmath39 and boundary operator",
    "@xmath230 we consider the operator @xmath332 defined as @xmath333 .",
    "this operator will act on appropriate hilbert spaces @xmath334 and @xmath335 , @xmath336 . in analog way as we did in we define the null space @xmath337 as @xmath338 the range of @xmath332 is defined by @xmath339 and the complement of the range is given by @xmath340 where @xmath341 denotes the hilbert scalar product .",
    "we can write now properties ( i)-(ii ) as follows    * @xmath337 has finite dimension .",
    "* @xmath342 has finite dimension .",
    "an operator which satisfies ( i)-(ii ) is called a _ fredholm",
    "_ operator .",
    "( we have assumed that @xmath332 is bounded , otherwise in ( ii ) we need to impose that @xmath343 is closed , see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we have the following general result ( we only sketch the statement , for details and proofs see @xcite,@xcite and also @xcite )    [ horm ] if the system @xmath39 is properly elliptic in @xmath344 and the boundary conditions satisfy the complementing condition for every point of @xmath3 , then the operator @xmath345 is fredholm .",
    "we have seen that the dimension of @xmath346 ( and hence uniqueness ) is not invariant if we add lower order terms to the operator .",
    "one of the consequence of theorem [ horm ] is the existence of an invariant for elliptic problems : the fredholm index .",
    "this number is defined as @xmath347 it can be proved that the index @xmath348 is stable under perturbation , in particular it does not depend on the lower order terms .    in section [ sec",
    ": so ] we have used the green formula to construct the formal adjoint operator @xmath46 and its corresponding boundary operator @xmath349 . in this case",
    "we can define @xmath350 , and it can be proved we can define the hilbert adjoint @xmath351 .",
    "this is not related , in general , with the formal adjoint @xmath352 .",
    "however , when we have a green formula , it is possible to prove that in fact @xmath353 ( see theorem 8.4 of @xcite , @xcite and also @xcite ] that @xmath354 .",
    "that is , the boundary value problems considered in theorem [ t1 ] and [ t2 ] have @xmath355 .",
    "in fact these theorems also show that the index does not depend on the lower order terms in this particular case .",
    "boundary conditions which come from a green formula are called _ normal boundary conditions_. the advantage of them is that we have a characterization of @xmath342 through the formal adjoint problem , and then we can in principle compute the conditions that the sources should satisfy in order to have a solution .",
    "general results for normal boundary conditions for higher order elliptic equations can be found in @xcite @xcite .",
    "since these boundary conditions come from an integration by parts , the order the boundary operators will be always less than the operator itself .",
    "we have seen that this is not necessary the case for general elliptic boundary conditions that satisfy the complementing condition . for the general case",
    ", we will not have a characterization of @xmath342 .",
    "we have seen that the dirichlet boundary conditions satisfy the complementing condition for strongly elliptic systems . using this fact , general existence results for the dirichlet problem can be proved ( see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that the index is always zero in this case .",
    "finally , we want to present an existence result for the operator considered in example [ ex : york ] that can be deduced from the general theorem [ horm ] ( see @xcite ) in this case , we have a green formula and then we have normal boundary conditions .",

    "uniqueness in this theorem follows because there exists no killing or conformal killing vector which vanishes at the boundary .",

    "@xmath364 this problem has a solution if and only if @xmath365 if @xmath366 and @xmath326 are two different solutions , then the difference @xmath367 satisfies @xmath363 .    in the case of the einstein constraint equations ,",
    "the previous theorems can be used to prove existence of solutions of the momentum constraint ( see @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the physical quantity is the second fundamental form @xmath368 which is given by @xmath369 where @xmath370 is an ( essentially ) arbitrary tensor .",
    "then , as in the case of the neumann problem for the laplace equation , the lack of uniqueness in theorem [ t4 ] will not affect @xmath368 .",
    "in order to check if a system of equations is elliptic , we should first prove that the principal part of the operator satisfy definitions [ dn ] and [ sc ] .",
    "if the system is non linear , we should consider the corresponding linearized problem .",
    "then we should prove that the boundary operators satisfy the complementing condition ( definition [ cc ] ) .",
    "this can be complicated .",
    "there exist equivalent formulations of this condition ( see for example @xcite ) , some of them can be more suitable for specific problems .",
    "it is also important to know if the boundary conditions come from a green formula ( normal boundary conditions ) .",
    "the green formula can be used to prove that the complementing condition holds ( as we have seen in the examples ) . moreover , for the case of higher order equations there exist general results that can be used ( see @xcite ) .",
