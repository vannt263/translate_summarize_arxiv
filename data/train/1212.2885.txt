    "<S> percolation was introduced in @xcite as a mathematical model of a porous medium , where the physical space is modeled by the lattice @xmath0 , and the pure substance is described as a random subset @xmath1 of @xmath0 . </S>",

    "<S> as we will show , the above conditions are general enough to be satisfied by many models , including random interlacements , the vacant set of random interlacements , and the level sets of the gaussian free field ( see sections  [ sec : ri ] , [ sec : vsri ] , and [ sec : gff ] , respectively ) . in our context , </S>",
    "<S> the last two models are particularly challenging since , in contrast to random interlacements , they exhibit percolation phase transitions . for the time being we can not deal with their entire supercritical phases . </S>",

    "<S> let us also emphasize here that the above models give rise to random subsets of @xmath0 with _ polynomial decay of correlations _ , but still they satisfy the weak decorrelation condition , as we show in sections  [ sec : ri ] , [ sec : vsri ] , and [ sec : gff ] .    </S>",

    "<S> however , the techniques of @xcite heavily rely on the specific connectivity properties of @xmath19 , and in particular , the question of whether these results hold for the vacant set @xmath20 of random interlacements also had remained unsolved ( and similarly for the level sets of gaussian free field ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to answering these questions positively , our method also provides a general , model independent approach . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for a possible application our results to other percolation models by checking the conditions  and  in order to derive chemical distance results and shape theorems for them . in this context </S>",
    "<S> , it would for example be interesting to see whether the random cluster model ( see @xcite for a reference ) satisfies all of the above conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> another potential advantage of our general framework is that it seems to capture the key properties ( i.e. ,  and  ) of a dependent percolation model which imply that the geometry of @xmath2 is similar to that of @xmath0 . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , recent progress indicates that our conditions imply that simple random walk on @xmath2 behaves similarly to random walk on @xmath0 , see remark [ remark_isoperimetry ] for further discussion .    finally , using a connection between random interlacements and random walk on the discrete torus </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain new results about the ( chemical ) diameter of the giant connected component in the complement of the random walk trace ( see section  [ sec : rwtorus ] ) . </S>"
