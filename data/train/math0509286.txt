    "@xmath8 with values in @xmath17 , their main conjecture asserts that @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the non - abelian euler characteristic of the dual of the @xmath20-selmer group of @xmath21 twisted by @xmath8 ( see  [ ssnonabeuler ] ) .",

    "first , under suitable hypotheses ( see theorem [ main ] ) we show that @xmath27 as predicted by the conjectures .",
    "we also show that the corresponding statement for @xmath28 and @xmath29 implied by the main conjecture also follows from the conjecture of birch and swinnerton - dyer ( see  [ ssbsd ] ) . finally , we test the full congruence between @xmath30 and @xmath31 numerically for varying @xmath5 , @xmath10 and @xmath13 .",

    "now , for any elliptic curve @xmath3 and any artin representation @xmath8 , the twisted @xmath0-function @xmath47 is an analytic function for @xmath48 that is conjectured to have an analytic continuation to @xmath49 .",
    "in fact , for artin representations of @xmath26 , this conjecture follows from modularity of elliptic curves over @xmath1 and cyclic base change from the theory of automorphic forms ( @xcite , theorem 14 ) .",
    "deligne s conjecture @xcite then states that the quotient of @xmath16 by the period @xmath50 is an algebraic number ( see the list of notation  [ intronot ] ) .",
    "this is also true for artin representations of @xmath26 by the results of @xcite .",
    "there it is also shown that further modifying the value by the global @xmath51-factor of @xmath8 , @xmath52 lies in the field of definition of @xmath8 .",

    "unfortunately , the conductors of the relevant twists of @xmath5 are extremely large . for @xmath67 ,",
    "if @xmath30 and @xmath31 are @xmath10-adic units , then the congruence between them follows from the birch  swinnerton - dyer conjecture .",

    "this gives a formula for the quotient @xmath71 , where the only difficult terms are the orders of the tate - shafarevich groups .",
    "as these are squares , for @xmath67 they do not affect the congruence modulo 3 .",
    "for @xmath72 this argument gives the congruence modulo squares in @xmath73 , but the full congruence appears to be stronger than what can be deduced from the birch  swinnerton - dyer conjecture .",
