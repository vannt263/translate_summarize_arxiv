    "in the early 1990s the free energy of a massless scalar field theory was calculated to order @xmath1 in refs .",
    "this was quickly followed by similar calculations in qed @xcite and qcd @xcite .",
    "the scalar , qed , and qcd free energies to order @xmath2 were then obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite , refs .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "recent results have extended the calculation of the qcd free energy by determining the coefficient of the @xmath3 contribution @xcite .",
    "for massless scalar @xmath4 the perturbative free energy is now known to order @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite",
    ".    however , the resulting weak - coupling approximations , truncated order - by - order in the coupling constant , are poorly convergent unless the coupling constant is extremely small .",
    "for example , simply comparing the magnitude of low - order contributions to the @xmath7 qcd free energy one finds that the @xmath8 contribution is smaller than the @xmath9 contribution only for @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this is a troubling situation since at phenomenologically accessible temperatures near the critical temperature for the qcd deconfinement phase transition , the strong coupling constant is on the order of @xmath12 .    , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "shaded bands correspond to variation of the renormalization scale @xmath16 between @xmath17 and @xmath18.,width=359 ]    the poor convergence of finite - temperature perturbative expansions of the free energy is not limited to qcd .",
    "the same behavior can be seen in weak - coupling expansions in scalar field theory @xcite and qed @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pertpressure ] we show the successive perturbative approximations to the qed free energy . as can be seen from this figure , at couplings larger than @xmath19 the qed weak - coupling approximations also exhibit poor convergence . for this reason",
    "a concerted effort has been put forth to find a reorganization of finite - temperature perturbation theory which converges at phenomenologically relevant couplings .",
    "there are several ways of systematically reorganizing the perturbative expansion to improve its convergence and the various approaches have been reviewed in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we will describe recent advances in the application of hard - thermal - loop perturbation theory ( htlpt ) @xcite .",
    "the htlpt method is inspired by variational perturbation theory  @xcite and is a a gauge - invariant extension of scalar screened perturbation theory ( spt )  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the technique is to add and subtract an effective mass term from the bare lagrangian and to associate the added piece with the free lagrangian and the subtracted piece with the interactions .",
    "however , in gauge theories , one can not simply add and subtract a local mass term since this would violate gauge invariance .",
    "instead one adds and subtracts a htl improvement term which modifies the propagators and vertices in such a way that the framework is manifestly gauge - invariant .",
    "the free part of the lagrangian then includes the htl self - energies and the remaining terms are treated as perturbations .    in this brief proceedings review we present results of a calculations of the qed free energy ( pressure ) to three - loop order in htlpt based on the work detailed in ref .  @xcite . as we will show , the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) htlpt resummed qed free energy give approximations which show improved convergence for couplings as large as @xmath20 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : nlonnlo ] ) .",
    "in addition , we compare our results to those obtained using the 2pi @xmath21-derivable approach @xcite and show that at three loops the agreement between the htlpt and @xmath21-derivable approaches is quite good .",
    "the lagrangian density for massless qed in minkowski space is @xmath22 here the field strength is @xmath23 and the covariant derivative is @xmath24 .",
    "the ghost term @xmath25 depends on the gauge - fixing term @xmath26 .",
    "we will use dimensional regularization with a renormalization scale @xmath16 and covariant gauge fixing such that the ghost terms decouple .",
    "hard - thermal - loop perturbation theory is a reorganization of the perturbation series for thermal gauge theories . in the case of qed",
    ", the lagrangian density is written as @xmath27 the htl improvement term is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a light - like four - vector , and @xmath30 represents an average over the directions of @xmath31 .",
    "the term  ( [ l - htl ] ) has the form of the effective lagrangian that would be induced by a rotationally - invariant ensemble of charged sources with infinitely high momentum .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 can be identified with the debye screening mass and the parameter @xmath33 can be identified as the induced finite - temperature electron mass .",
    "htlpt is defined by treating @xmath34 as a formal expansion parameter and expanding order by order in @xmath34 around @xmath35 .",
    "this generates loops with fully dressed propagators and vertices and also automatically generates the counterterms necessary to remove the dressing as one proceeds to higher loop orders .",
    "if the expansion in @xmath34 could be calculated to all orders , the final result would not depend on @xmath32 or @xmath33 . however , any truncation of the expansion in @xmath34 produces results that depend on @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "some prescription is required to determine @xmath32 and @xmath33 as a function of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "for example , one can choose to treat both as variational parameters that should be determined by minimizing the free energy or one can fix @xmath32 and @xmath33 using a perturbative prescription .",
    "we will compare both methods .",
    "we will obtain the thermodynamic potential @xmath38 which is a function of the mass parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the free energy @xmath39 is obtained by evaluating the thermodynamic potential at the appropriate values of the thermal masses .",
    "other thermodynamic functions can then be obtained by taking appropriate derivatives of @xmath39 with respect to @xmath36 .",
    "in this section we present the final renormalized thermodynamic potential explicitly through order @xmath40 , aka nnlo , as obtained by us in ref  @xcite .",
    "the final nnlo expression is completely analytic ; however , there are some numerically determined constants which remain in the final expressions at nlo .",

    "@xcite we considered two possible mass prescriptions in order to see how much the results vary given the two different assumptions .",
    "first we considered the variational solutions for the thermal masses and second we considered using the @xmath15 perturbative expansion of the debye mass @xcite and the @xmath13 perturbative expansion of the fermion mass  @xcite .",
