    "we will address the automorphy of the galois representations associated to certain calabi - yau threefolds of borcea  voisin type over @xmath0 . here by the automorphy , we mean the langlands reciprocity conjecture which claims that the @xmath13-series ( of the @xmath14-adic tale cohomology group ) of the calabi - yau threefolds over @xmath0 come from automorphic representations .",
    "for our calabi ",
    "yau threefolds , we will show that these representations arise as induced automorphic cuspidal representations of @xmath15 of some abelian number fields @xmath16 .",
    "our calabi ",
    "yau threefolds were previously considered by voisin @xcite and also by borcea @xcite from the point of view of geometry and also towards physics ( mirror symmetry ) applications .",

    "let @xmath9 be any elliptic curve with involution @xmath10 , and let @xmath2 be a @xmath1 surface with involution @xmath3 acting by @xmath4 on @xmath5 .",
    "the quotient threefold @xmath18 is singular , but the singularities are all cyclic quotient singularities , and there is an explicit crepant resolution , which yields a smooth calabi  yau threefold @xmath11 . to find our @xmath1 surfaces , we use the famous @xmath6 families of @xmath1 surfaces which can be given by weighted homogeneous equations in weighted projective @xmath7-spaces .",
    "they are classified by m. reid  @xcite ( see also iano  fletcher  @xcite ) , and also in yonemura  @xcite .",
    "yonemura gave explicit equations for these surfaces as weighted hypersurfaces @xmath19 using toric methods , and we will use yonemura s list throughout this article .",
    "we first fish out , from the list of yonemura , @xmath1 surfaces @xmath2 having the required involutions @xmath3 acting on the holomorphic @xmath20-forms of the surfaces as multiplication by @xmath4 .",

    "( we should call attention why we only have @xmath35 pairs : what happens to the remaining @xmath36 pairs ?",

    "thus , we obtain @xmath1 surfaces @xmath2 of delsarte type .",
    "recall that a cohomology group of a variety is of cm type if its hodge group is commutative ; and a variety is of cm type if all its cohomology groups are of cm type ( see zarhin , @xcite ) . in general the computation of hodge groups is notoriously difficult , and this is definitely not the direction we will pursue .",
