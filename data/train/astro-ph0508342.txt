    "the study of high - mass star - formation has attracted much recent attention .",
    "molinari et al ( 1996 , 2002 ) and sridharan et al ( 2002 ) have reported systematic studies of candidate high - mass proto - stellar objects ( hmpos ) , leading to a number of follow - ups .",
    "a key unresolved question is : how similar are the high- and low - mass star - formation processes ?",
    "do high - mass stars go through a disk - accretion phase , which is a central idea in the current , widely accepted scenario for low - mass star - formation ?",
    "sufficient observational data is beginning to be available for the hmpos to answer these questions .",
    "the outflow phase has been shown to be as prevalent towards the hmpos as towards lower - mass objects , and by implication an accretion disk can be inferred ( zhang et al 2001 , beuther et al 2002b ) .",
    "while there is good evidence for rotating disks of radius @xmath1 several 1000 au ( cesaroni et al 1997 , 2005 , zhang , hunter & sridharan , 1998 , beltran et al 2005 ) , outflows presumably require a compact disk and direct evidence for their presence is rare ( patel et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "compact disks have been proposed previously , although not directly imaged ( cesaroni et al 1997 & 1999 ; shepherd & kurtz 1999 , shepherd , claussen & kurtz , 2001 ) .    among hmpo candidates ,",
    "iras20126 + 4104 is particularly well studied ( cesaroni et al 1997 , 1999 , 2005 , zhang et al 1999 , yao et al , 2000 , shepherd et al 2000 ) .",
    "it has a luminosity of @xmath1 10@xmath4 l@xmath5 at a distance of 1.7 kpc .",
    "recent observations suggest a mass of @xmath1 7 m@xmath5 ( cesaroni et al 2005 ) , significantly lower than previous estimates of 20 - 24 m@xmath5 ( cesaroni et al 1999 , zhang , hunter & sridharan , 1998 ) .",
    "it harbours water , hydroxyl and methanol masers ( tofani et al 1995 , minier et al 2001 , edris et al 2005 ) and an outflow / jet system traced in co , sio , h@xmath6 and cm - wavelength continuum emission .",
    "it has a rotating disk of radius @xmath1 5000 au , traced in ammonia and cs ( zhang , hunter & sridharan 1998 ; cesaroni et al 2005 ) and a possible smaller @xmath1 1000 au radius disk inferred from interferometric ch@xmath7cn measurements ( cesaroni et al 1999 ) .",
    "sensitive cm - wavelength continuum images have uncovered emission south of the central object suggesting the presence of a companion ( hofner et al 1999 ) , also indicated by the precession of the h@xmath6 jet from this source ( shepherd et al 2000 , cesaroni et al 2005 ) .",
    "we note that iras20126 + 4104 is a member of a large sample of hmpo candidates we have been studying systematically ( sridharan et al 2002 , beuther et al 2002a , b , williams , fuller & sridharan 2004 , 2005 ) .    here ,",
    "we report the infrared detection of a compact disk / binary system in iras20126 + 4104 , consisting of a small scale circumstellar disk and a secondary source .",
    "the observations were carried out during 15 - 18 aug , 2000 .",
    "we imaged iras20126 + 4104 using the near - infrared cameras ufti ( 1 - 2.5 @xmath8 m ) and tufti / ircam ( 1 - 5 @xmath8 m ) on the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) .",
    "tufti is a 256@xmath9256 insb array with a field of view of 20.7@xmath2 and 0.08@xmath2 pixels .",
    "ufti has a 1024@xmath91024 hgcdte array with 0.09@xmath2 pixels and a field of view of 93@xmath2 .",
    "the seeing during these measurements was excellent , at @xmath1 0.3@xmath2 ( k band ) .",
    "observations were made with broadband k , l@xmath0 , and m@xmath0 filters ( central wavelengths of 2.2 , 3.8 & 4.7@xmath8 m ) .",
    "the k band observations employed a 11@xmath2 jitter and the l@xmath0 and m@xmath0 observations used 8.5@xmath2 , 7.5@xmath2 and 6.5@xmath2 jitters and a 2@xmath2 jitter with a 30@xmath2 chop .",
    "standard data reduction steps were used to obtain the final images .",
    "several calibration stars were observed for reliable photometry .",
    "we used k - band objects from the 2mass survey to fit separate plate solutions for the k and l@xmath0 images .",
    "the formal errors for the plate solutions are 0.15@xmath2 rms , consistent with the 2mass astrometric accuracy .",
    "the error on the relative registration is 0.1@xmath2 rms , measured using the positions of the same objects in the independently registered k and l@xmath0 images .",
    "since the m@xmath0 image does not include any reference objects , we cross - correlated it with the l@xmath0 image to find the best position offset .",
    "we estimate the absolute registration uncertainty to be @xmath10 .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , we detect two , previously unknown , faint lobes of emission in the k - band , k - se & k - nw , near the center of the iras20126 + 4104 outflow region .",
    "previous images only showed the bi - polar features on larger @xmath1 10@xmath2 scales oriented at about the same position angle as the molecular and the cm - wavelength outflows ( cesaroni et al 1997 , ayala et al 1998 , shepherd et al , 2000 ) .",
    "the new emission objects are separated by a dark lane with the line joining them oriented nw - se , similar to the larger scale bi - polar features .",
    "figure 2 ( left panel ) shows the l@xmath0 and k emission in the central 2@xmath2 , where the center of the dark lane is seen to nearly coincide with the location of the mm - wavelegth emission from interferometric images .",
    "the l@xmath0 emission over the region lies close to the dark lane seen in the k band .",
    "the peak of this central emission is nearly centered on the dark lane , within registration errors .",
    "emission is also seen towards the k - band lobes .",
    "in addition , there is a point source like object seen @xmath1 0.5@xmath2 southwest of the center .",
    "this second object is at one end of , and in line with , the dark lane .",
    "the center panel in figure 2 shows the m@xmath0 emission contours superposed on the k image .",
    "the m@xmath0 emission has a similar morphology as that in the l@xmath0 band , but with the central object more prominent .",
    "the correspondence between the emission in the l@xmath0 and the m@xmath0 bands is shown in the right panel .",
    "the source detected at l@xmath11 to the southwest of the peak is also seen in the m@xmath11 image , confirming its reality .",
    "this also validates our method of cross - correlating l@xmath0 and m@xmath0 band images for registration , which is sensitive only to the strongest emission features in the images .",
    "bi - polar infrared morphologies similar to the ones found in our data are frequently seen in near infrared observations of low mass young stars , for example the hst images of t tauri stars by padgett et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . towards the low mass objects these morphologies have been interpreted as due to the presence of nearly edge - on circumstellar disks .",
    "therefore we suggest that our images represent the first detection of a small scale disk towards a young high - mass star , as a silhoutte at nir wavelengths .",
    "the width of the dark lane , which corresponds to the thickness of the disk is @xmath1 0.5@xmath2 and the diameter is less certain at @xmath1 1@xmath2 .",
    "the implied linear dimensions of the disk are @xmath12 au thickness , for radii 1000 au .",
    "this is comparable to the size of the disk inferred from the ch@xmath7cn data of cesaroni et al ( 1999 ) .",
    "these sizes are significantly larger than the small - scale disks seen towards low - mass star - forming regions as may be expected for higher - mass proto - stars .",
    "the presence of the second source makes this object more interesting .",
    "as seen in figs 2 - 4 , this second object is located on the same side of the central object as the cm - wavelength jet of hofner et al ( 1999 ; shown by a cross mark to the south ) .",
    "given the closeness of the two l@xmath0 & m@xmath0 band objects , ( @xmath1 0.5@xmath2 = 850 au ) , we may be seeing a young high - mass binary system .",
    "we suggest that the second object to the southwest is the companion responsible for the precessing h@xmath6 emission outflow ( shepherd et al 2000 , cesaroni et al 2005 ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the companion is in line with the disk .",
    "it is probably close to the equatorial plane , although due to unresolved projection effects , this can not be said with certainty .",
    "we point out that in the ch@xmath7cn disk inferred by cesaroni et al ( 1999 ) , the emission peaks appear to cut off beyond the location of the companion .",
    "the location of the companion does not match the location of the cm - jet , which raises the possibility of a triple system .",
    "we now make some very simple and approximate estimates of the extinction due to the envelope surrounding the disk - binary system and that due to the disk , separately .",
    "we use the observed colours of the binary and the bi - polar features along with the interstellar reddening law from koorneef ( 1983 ) ( in particular , @xmath13 & @xmath14 ) for this purpose . for all stellar objects , intrinsic k - l@xmath0 and l@xmath0-m@xmath0 colours of @xmath1 0",
    "are assumed .",
    "two cases , _ scattered _ and _ direct _ , are considered , where line of sight reddening occurs with and without preceding rayleigh scattering ( @xmath15 dependence ; k - l@xmath16 & l@xmath0-m@xmath17 ) .    the magnitudes and colours , from aperture photometry , for the whole region ,",
    "the central lobes and the binary components ( central and companion ) are presented in table 1 . for the k band , using the fluxes of the h@xmath6 knots ( cesaroni et al 1997 ) and spectra from ayala et al ( 1998 ) , a line emission contamination of a few percent or @xmath18 0.1 magnitude is estimated . contamination in the l@xmath0 and m@xmath0 bands",
    "are not considered .",
    "this is reasonable for the l@xmath0 band due to its large bandwidth .",
    "the integrated emission over the whole region , excluding obvious point - like sources , is in agreement with the k band flux reported by cesaroni et al ( 1997 ) .",
    "the colour of this emission is consistent with light from main sequence stars , implying 120 & 116 magnitudes of @xmath19 ( mean 118 ) for the _ scattered _ case , and @xmath1 65 magnitude for the _ direct _ case .",
    "therefore , an @xmath19 of 65 - 118 is considered to be the extinction due to the envelope .    for the central lobes , the extinctions ( _ scattered _ case ) implied",
    "are 113 and 127 ( mean 120 ) from k - l@xmath0 colours , similar to the upper limit estimate for the @xmath1 10@xmath2 features . since the emission from central and companion objects and the bi - polar lobes can not be well seperated , the l@xmath0 magnitudes are lower limits ( the lobes may be fainter ) , and the extinctions , upper limits . in summary ,",
    "the envelope extinction is in the range 65 - 120 .",
    "turning to the binary itself , assuming @xmath1 0 for the intrinsic colours of the stars , the limits on the observed k - l@xmath0 colours imply a lower limit ( not detected in the k band ) to @xmath19 towards the central and the companion objects of @xmath1 96 & 91 , for the _ direct _ case and 149 & 144 for the _ scattered _ case . from the l@xmath0@xmath20m@xmath0 colours ,",
    "the values are 168 & 148 and 221 & 200 , for the two cases , consistent with the lower limits from k - l@xmath0 colours .",
    "the ranges 168 - 221 and 148 - 200 will be used for the two objects for further discussion .",
    "this translates to a h@xmath6 column density of @xmath1 2@xmath910@xmath21 @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ; frerking , langer & wilson , 1982 ) . in comparsion ,",
    "beuther et al ( 2002a ) estimated an extinction of 553 magnitudes for the dust core ( 11@xmath24 beam ) , or 276 magnitude up to the center .",
    "it is interesting that the extinction towards the companion is less than that towards the central object : we speculate that this may be due to a gap cleared by the companion outside of which the material may be less dense . as noted before , the ch@xmath7cn emission peaks in cesaroni et al ( 1999 ) , which trace high densities , are distributed within the area bounded by the companion which supports such a picture .",
    "these measurements allow an estimate of the range of masses for the disk and nir magnitudes for the embedded stellar objects . with an envelope extinction of @xmath1 65 - 120 ,",
    "the excess extinctions towards the two objects are in the range @xmath25 48 - 166 and @xmath1 28 - 135 .",
    "this extinction may be attributed to the disk and translates to @xmath26 @xmath22 . for a",
    "1000 au @xmath9 2000 au disk , a mass of @xmath1 0.1 m@xmath5 is indicated .",
    "this is quite uncertain due to the many assumptions , and our inablility to reliably separate the contributions to the measured magnitudes from the two embedded young stars and the bi - polar lobes .",
    "additional uncertainties are due to part of the l@xmath0 and m@xmath0 band emission coming from hot dust in the disk which would change the colours , and the mass of such a component is also not considered .",
    "flaring of the disk and its inclination to the line of sight , which would increase the mass estimates , are not considered .",
    "therefore , we beleive 0.1 m@xmath5 to be an approximate lower limit to the mass within 1000 au from the central star . in comparsion ,",
    "cesaroni et al ( 2005 ) estimate the mass of the disk within 5000 au from the star to be 1 - 4 m@xmath5 .",
    "they estimated peak h@xmath6 column densities for the disk of 1.5 - 3.4@xmath910@xmath27 @xmath22 from c@xmath28s measurements ( using numbers listed in their table 4 ) compared with our @xmath110@xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "we note that our images do not constrain the radius of the disk - it can be larger than @xmath11000 au , in which case our mass estimate would go up .",
    "also , observations such as ours selectively probe the lowest extinction paths through which photons escape , leading again to lower estimates for extinctions and masses .",
    "we note that fuller , zijlstra & williams ( 2001 ) estimated a similar low mass for a proposed nir disk in the high - mass jet object iras18556 + 0136 .",
    "what are the masses implied for the two young stars ? assuming main sequence objects and total extinctions of @xmath25 168 - 221 and @xmath1 148 - 200 for the two , the extinction corrected l@xmath0 magnitudes are : 3.6 - 1.3 and 4.7 - 2.4 ( @xmath29 ; from koorneef , 1983 ) . with a distance modulus of 11.2 ,",
    "the absolute l@xmath0 magnitudes implied are : @xmath207.6 - @xmath209.9 & @xmath206.5 - @xmath208.8 corresponding to very early o spectral types - o4 and earlier ( wegner 2000 ; serabyn , shupe & figer , 1998 ) .",
    "for the primary object , cesaroni et al ( 2005 ) derived a mass of @xmath1 7 m@xmath5 using the keplerian velocity field they observed , singnificantly changing earlier estimates of 20 - 24 m@xmath5 and implied zams spectral types of o8-o9 ( cesaroni et al 1999 , zhang , hunter & sridharan , 1998 ) .",
    "again , we emphasize that our estimates are to be considered approximate - in addition to the previously mentioned uncertainties , any emission in the l@xmath0 and m@xmath0 bands from the disk would lower the magnitudes estimated for the stars - and it is almost certain that the stars are not as early types as implied . also , the main sequence assumption is questionable and the absolute nir magnitudes of the brightest main sequence stars remain poorly characterized .",
    "the companion is probably only @xmath1 1 magnitude fainter , which makes it significantly less massive , but comparable . a significant mass for the companion will appear to be in conflict with the recent observations of keplerian velocity profile ( cesaroni et al 2005 , edris et al 2005 ) .",
    "however , it is not clear if the keplerian profile holds good close to and inside the 0.5@xmath2 separation of the companion .",
    "higher resolution observations are critical to resolving the disagreements .",
    "nevertheless , our numbers do indicate that we are indeed dealing with a high - mass system .",
    "given the marginal linear resolution of the images , we have refrained from detailed modelling which should wait until higher resolution images are obtained with adaptive optics . fortunately , there is a bright star @xmath1 12@xmath2 from the center which makes iras20126 + 4104 an ideal candidate for such studies .",
    "we presented high resolution nir images of iras20126 + 4104 .",
    "the k - band image shows a dark lane separating two , new , 1@xmath24-scale bi - polar emission features , with the emission peaks in the longer wavelength l@xmath0 , m@xmath0 and mm - wave bands lying close to the dark lane .",
    "this is interpreted as due to a nearly edge - on disk of 850 au thickness for radii 1000 au , imaged and measured for the first time at infrared wavelengths .",
    "a new , point - like , second object , found to the southwest of the central object , and in line with the disk , is interpreted as a binary companion with a separation of @xmath1 1000 au .",
    "estimates of the nir magnitudes of the objects , although very approximate , indicate a high - mass system . through their striking resemblence to similar low - mass systems ,",
    "the new images demonstrate that the processes involved in the formation of low and high mass stars may have much in common : viz .",
    ", multiple star formation in an accretion disk setting .",
    "further higher resolution studies will be extremely rewarding in modelling the system and therefore to address a number of issues related to high - mass star - formation .",
