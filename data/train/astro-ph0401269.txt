    "although one may refer this energy transfer to the third or even higher order derivative of the effective potential @xmath213 of the inflaton , the index - running shown in fig.4 can only be obtained through a proper off - equilibrium dynamics , but not by the classical effective potential approach .",

    "the dwt modes are not correlated and therefore , the correlation function @xmath302 is trivial , as long as the scale under consideration is larger than the compton wavelength of the scalar field .",
    "= 5.0 in    however , for the self - interacting @xmath0 model the dwt mode - mode correlations [ eq .",

    "( [ masspert])-([pressure ] ) , it is straightforward to calculate the normalized two - point space - scale correlation function defined as @xmath304 .    as a numerical example , the normalized two - point space - scale correlations of density perturbations under different initial conditions are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , in which the parameters are taken to be @xmath305 and @xmath306 . from eq .",

    "the space - scale correlation function approaches zero drastically as the distance @xmath314 between the two modes increases ; while the correlation deviates from zero and lasts for a long range for perturbations with @xmath315 initially .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] plots the same correlations as in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] but with respect to @xmath316 , or @xmath317 , which corresponds to the number of e - foldings @xmath318 .",
    "the behavior of correlations under the initial condition @xmath231 remains the same .",
    "however , the correlations with @xmath319 do not coincide with those shown in figure  [ fig7 ] . that is , the space - scale correlation of density perturbations in the model with @xmath320 initially does not experience a significant evolution during the first few e - foldings of the inflationary expansion , while the correlation in the model with initial @xmath321 does .",
    "therefore , the @xmath322-dependence of the mode - mode correlation is practical to test the dynamical predictions about the evolution ( @xmath193-dependence ) of the primordial perturbations .",
    "since the resolution of dwt basically can be refined as required by the problem in hand , one is capable of exploring the physics of the very early universe by means of the mode - mode correlations in phase space .",

    "it is known that most information of the dynamics and initial conditions of the system will be lost during the non - equilibrium evolution .",
    "the non - equilibrium evolution can only be probed via the observable remains produced from such a process . in this paper , we have shown that the off - equilibrium evolution of cosmological inflation may have two such observable `` remains '' .",
    "the first one is the running spectral index of primordial perturbations induced by the scale - dependence due to the self - interaction of the inflaton .",
    "we found that the running spectral index depends essentially on the rate of the particle creation and the energy transfer from the background to the inflaton fluctuations as well as the evolution of the background field .",
    "it is a signature of the energy transferring dynamics during the inflation . although the running index of the @xmath0 model is small comparing to current data , the negative running ( fig .",
    "4 ) does coincide with the wmap observation .",
    "the second remain is the correlation function between phase space modes of the density perturbation . under the influence of the self - interaction , fluctuations created from the background field",
    "are no longer white noises .",
    "although the one - point distribution function of fluctuations in each hartree mode is gaussian , the power of the fluctuations is scale - dependent , which gives rise to the correlation between the phase space modes of the energy density perturbation .",
    "moreover , since the dynamical evolution of the correlation depends upon the initial conditions of the inflation , the mode - mode correlation of density perturbations also provides a window to study the dynamics of the self - interaction _ as well as _ the initial conditions of the inflation . here , we would like to emphasis two important results .",
    "first , the initial - condition - dependency of correlation functions is irrelevant to the number of fields in action .",
    "second , the inflationary density perturbations after the superhorizon evolution are not the fluctuations of thermal equilibrium state .",
    "therefore , the dependence of the correlation function upon the initial conditions does not contradict with the reheating of the universe , which is generally produced by the interactions between @xmath1 and other fields .",
    "thus , we may expect that the non - trivial mode - mode correlation in the phase space is detectable via a dwt analysis on the cmb temperature map , or other observations on the large scale structure relevant to the density perturbations  @xcite .",
    "although , the @xmath0 model is just an example to illuminate the off - equilibrium effects from the self - interaction of the inflaton field , we believe the implication from what we have found in this paper is also useful to other interacting inflation models .",
    "for instance , the scale - dependence of perturbations drawn from the self - consistent off - equilibrium dynamics is generally different from that obtained by the third or the higher derivative of a classical effective potential .",
    "therefore , the running spectral index determined by the formalism of various effective potentials would be questionable if the interaction or self - interaction of the inflaton is substantial .",
