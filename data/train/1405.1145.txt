    "recently , the clas collaboration at jefferson national accelerator facility released their exclusive photoproduction cross sections for the @xmath0(1520 ) , @xmath4(1385 ) and @xmath0(1405 ) for energies from near threshold up to a center of mass energy @xmath5 of 2.85 gev with large range of the @xmath6 production angle  @xcite ( labeled as clas13 in this work ) .",
    "since threshold for the photoproduction of @xmath7 is about 2.01 gev , the new experimental data with high precision released by the clas collaboration provide an opportunity to study the nucleon resonances above 2 gev .    among about two dozen nucleon resonances predicted by the constituent quark model , a @xmath8 state @xmath1 with two star , which is labeled as @xmath9 in the previous version of particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite , should play the most important role in the photoproduction of @xmath7 off proton target due to its large decay widths in @xmath10 and @xmath11 channels predicted in the constituent quark model  @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 has attracted much attentions due to its importance found in many channels , such as @xmath12  @xcite , @xmath13 photoproduction  @xcite and @xmath14 photoproduction  @xcite .",
