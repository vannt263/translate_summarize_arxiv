    "in 2009 , a new type of building block - kinked silicon nanowire ( ksinw ) - was synthesized by tian _",
    "_ in leiber s group at harvard university.@xcite particularly , they were able to manipulate the arm length of the kink by controlling the growing time .",
    "since then , great experimental efforts have been devoted to investigating the growth mechanism of the kinks in silicon nanowires ( sinws).@xcite besides these experimental works , schwarz and tersoff have proposed a theoretical model to interpret the growth mechanism of ksinws . in their model ,",
    "the formation of kinks is due to the interplay of three basic processes : facet growth , droplet statics , and the introduction of new facets.@xcite stimulated by ksinws , several groups have synthesized kinks in other nanowires , such as @xmath1 multi - kinked nanowires,@xcite kinked germanium nanowires,@xcite germanium  silicon axial heterostructure with kinks,@xcite and kinked zno nanowires.@xcite while existing works for ksinw mainly concentrate on its growth mechanism , a new experiment from leiber s group has demonstrated the application of ksinws as nanoelectronic bioprobes.@xcite however , the study of thermal properties like thermal conductivity in ksinws is quite limited , although this is important for its application in thermoelectrics .",
    "recently , the thermal transport of sinws has attracted broad interest , because physical understanding of the thermal properties in nano - materials remains unclear.@xcite volz and chen predicted the ultra - low thermal conductivity of sinws , which was about two orders of magnitude smaller than the thermal conductivity of bulk si crystals obtained from molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations.@xcite a few years later , li _ et al .",
    "_ showed experimentally the ultra - low thermal conductivity of single sinw.@xcite in 1998 , the phonon confinement was firstly proposed as a mechanism for the thermal conductivity reduction in low - dimensional structures by balandin and wang,@xcite and this idea was worked out specifically to sinws and si - ge nws in the following years.@xcite ponomareva _ et.al _ also observed this phonon confinement effect on the thermal conductivity in sinws in 2007.@xcite yang _ et.al",
    "_ found very low thermal conductivity in the isotope - doped sinws.@xcite by introducing surface roughness , it was found that the thermal conductivity in nanowires can be greatly reduced from both theoretical@xcite and experimental examinations@xcite .",
    "for pristine sinws , the thermal conductivity is found to be strongly anisotropic.@xcite due to the effects of boundary scattering and confinement on lattice thermal conductivity , there is a significant progress on the applications of sinws .",
    "for example , sinws can be used in thermoelectric systems where ultra - low thermal conductivity materials are needed .    in this letter , we perform non - equilibrium md simulations to study the thermal conductivity in ksinws and compare it to that of straight silicon nanowires ( ssinws ) . we find that the thermal conductivity of ssinws can be reduced up to @xmath0 by kinks at room temperature and the reduction percentage depends on the temperature .",
    "after comparatively studying the phonon modes in the ssinw and the ksinw , we show that the reduction in the thermal conductivity comes from the kink - induced interchanging and pinching effects on some phonon modes in the ksinw .",
    "fig .  [ fig_cfg ] displays the configuration of three ksinws of 11.0   in diameter and 190.0   in length along the axial direction .",
    "the growth direction changes from one @xmath2 to another @xmath2 direction at the kink .",
    "the angle between these two @xmath2 directions is @xmath3 .",
    "fixed boundary condition is applied in the growth direction and free boundary condition is applied in the lateral direction .",
    "the force between silicon atoms in the newton equation is described by the commonly used tersoff bond order potentials.@xcite the newton equations are solved by the velocity verlet algorithm with an integration time step of 1.0 fs . a total simulation time is typically around 2.0 ns and will be sufficiently extended to guarantee the achievement of steady state whenever necessary .",
    "the two regions close to the left / right ends are maintained at high / low temperatures @xmath4 by nse - hoover thermostat.@xcite @xmath5 is the average temperature .",
    "@xmath6 is adopted in our calculation .",
    "the heat energy is pumped into the system through the left temperature - controlled region with thermal current @xmath7 and will flow out of the right temperature - controlled region with current @xmath8 . at steady state",
    ", we have @xmath9 as required by the energy conservation law . using this relation ,",
    "the thermal current across the system can be obtained by @xmath10 , with @xmath11 as an estimated error.@xcite the thermal conductivity is obtained from the fourier law .",
    "there is no quantum correction here , as all simulations are performed above room temperature .",
    "the quantum correction will become more important for lower temperature .",
    "for the lowest temperature in present work , i.e 300  k , the quantum correction can be estimated to be around @xmath12 , following the approach suggested by maiti , mahan , and pantelides.@xcite",
    "fig .  [ fig_kappa_narm ] shows the relative thermal conductivity versus the number of kinks of ksinws .",
    "the relative thermal conductivity of 1 corresponds to the value of thermal conductivity for the ssinw , which are 7.9 and 5.8  wm@xmath13k@xmath13 at 300 and 600  k , respectively .",
    "all systems have the same diameter ( @xmath14   ) and the same length ( @xmath15   ) along the axial direction .",
    "we have observed similar reduction in ksinws with other diameter and length . as expected",
    ", the reduction of the thermal conductivity is obvious in the kinked structures .",
    "the relative thermal conductivity decreases to @xmath16 and @xmath17 as the kink number increases from 0 to 11 at temperature 300k and 600 k , respectively .",
    "however , the relative thermal conductivity increases when keep increasing the kink number . in our simulation structures , the arm length @xmath18 ( see fig .  [ fig_cfg ] )",
    "is shortened as the kink number increases , which may be convenient for phonon transport .",
    "similarly , there is also a minimum thermal conductivity when increasing the interface number in superlattice structures.@xcite for ballistic heat transport , the minimum thermal conductivity results from the competition between the number and the localization properties of the confined phonon modes.@xcite for diffusive heat transport , the minimum thermal conductivity is attributed to the interplay between the wave and the particle nature of the phonon quasi - particles.@xcite    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_kappa_narm ] , the reduction of the thermal conductivity also depends on the temperature . to investigate the temperature effect",
    "further , we show the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity of both ssinws and ksinws in fig .",
    "[ fig_kappa_temperature ]  ( a ) . the thermal conductivity in ssinw decreases as the temperature increases because phonon - phonon scattering dominate the heat transport at high temperature . however , the thermal conductivity in ksinw is insensitive to the temperature .",
    "[ fig_kappa_temperature ]  ( b ) shows the thermal conductivity ratio of ksinw to ssinw based on the data in fig .",
    "[ fig_kappa_temperature ]  ( a ) .",
    "the relative thermal conductivity increases monotonically with increasing temperature , because the thermal conductivity in ssinws is largely deduced at high temperature and the thermal conductivity in ksinws is temperature insensitive .",
    "there are less phonon - phonon scatterings and a higher thermal conductivity in ssinws at low temperature , where the phonon pinching is more effective in confining the heat transfer .",
    "to reveal the microscopic origin for the reduction of the thermal conductivity in the ksinw , we comparatively study the phonon modes in the ssinw and ksinw , which are the only energy carrier in the non - metal solids . in fig .",
    "[ fig_phonon_110_d_11 ] , we show the dispersion of all four acoustic branches of ssinw@xcite , which are one longitudinal acoustic ( la ) , one twisting ( tw ) , and two transverse acoustic ( ta ) modes . the full phonon dispersion of ssinw is shown in the right bottom inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_phonon_110_d_11 ] .    to show the pinching effect in modes , we calculate the eigen modes of the four acoustic branches in the ssinw with length @xmath19 and a ksinw with one kink and @xmath20 in arm length .",
    "the diameter is kept the same for all structures .",
    "both ends of the nanowire are fixed in this calculation , which is consistent with the fixed boundary condition applied in the above thermal transport simulation .",
    "the phonon modes ( frequencies and polarization vectors ) are obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem of the dynamical matrix derived from the tersoff potential.@xcite the dynamical matrix is obtained by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the tersoff potential and @xmath23 is the position of the i - th degree of freedom .",
    "this formula is realized numerically by calculating the energy change after a small displacement of the i - th and j - th degrees of freedom .",
    "the obtained phonon modes from this calculation for the finite system are related to the traveling phonons in fig .",
    "[ fig_phonon_110_d_11 ] for a bulk structure ( with periodic boundary condition applying on a small unit cell ) .",
    "the former is essentially a special solution of the latter under particular boundary conditions ( fix boundary conditions here ) , so the phonon modes in the finite system can be decomposed into some traveling waves which will change into the corresponding reflection and tunneling waves at the kinks . as a result ,",
    "the phonon modes in the finite system provide intrinsic information for the thermal transport .    in the following ,",
    "the eigen modes in the ssinw are compared to those in the ksinw .",
    "four modes with the lowest frequency in each acoustic branch in ssinws are selected and presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_u ] .",
    "the polarization vectors of the eigen - modes are represented by arrows whose length corresponds to the amplitudes .",
    "red ( blue ) arrows indicate a mode with good ( poor ) heat transport capability ; i.e the phonon is extended ( pinched ) . to analyze the correspondence between phonon modes from both structures in fig .",
    "[ fig_u ] , we have examined the polarization vectors of the first thirty lowest - frequency phonon modes in the ssinw and the ksinw .    fig .",
    "[ fig_u ]  ( a ) shows the polarization vectors of a la mode ( along x direction ) with @xmath24  cm@xmath13 in the ssinw . in the ksinw , the polarization vector of a la mode with @xmath26  cm@xmath13 is not confined in x direction .",
    "when the phonon transfers along the ksinw from one end to the other , the la mode and ta@xmath27 mode interchange into each other , which leads to the lose of the coherence of the phonon mode and eventually reduces its heat transport capability .",
    "this deduction effect is also observed in the folded graphene nanoribbon structure.@xcite the frequency of the la mode in the ksinw is only slightly higher than that in the ssinw due to the kink effect .",
    "we note that there is a mirror reflection symmetry locates at the middle of the kin angle in the ksinw . due to this mirror symmetry",
    ", there is another la mode in the ksinw with closer frequency ( 8.0  cm@xmath13 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_u ]  ( b ) , we compare a @xmath28 mode in the ssinw and the ksinw , whose polarization vectors are all along the @xmath29-direction .",
    "the @xmath28 mode is almost not affected by the kink interface , owing to its special vibrating morphology which is perpendicular to the kink ( @xmath30 plane ) .",
    "there is barely a difference in the frequency and vibration between the @xmath28 modes in ssinw and that in ksinw .",
    "hence , the @xmath28 modes are good at heat delivery in both ssinws and ksinws .    in the following",
    ", the phonon pinching is shown obviously in @xmath31 and tw modes of ksinws .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ fig_u ]  ( c ) , there is a critical difference between the @xmath31 mode in ssinw and that in ksinw .",
    "the @xmath31 mode with @xmath32  cm@xmath13 in the ssinw is a quite extended mode .",
    "while in the ksinw , it is interesting that vibrating amplitudes of the @xmath31 mode ( @xmath33  cm@xmath13 ) are nearly zero at the kink .",
    "in other words , the polarization vector of this phonon mode is pinched - off by the kink .",
    "the polarization vectors of the @xmath31 modes are symmetric about the mirror plane at the kink .",
    "there is another @xmath31 with a closer frequency ( 2.0  cm@xmath13 ) in the ksinw , whose polarization vectors are anti - symmetric about the mirror plane , and the phonon pinching effect is also found there",
    ".    the pinching - off picture can be validated by the relationship between frequencies of corresponding modes in ssinws and ksinws .",
    "the frequency of the mode in the ksinw ( 2.8  cm@xmath13 ) is four times of the frequency in the ssinw ( 0.7  cm@xmath13 ) .",
    "the arm length of the ksinw is half of the length of the ssinw . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_phonon_110_d_11 ] , the frequency of the @xmath31 mode is proportional to the square of the wave vector , @xmath34 , due to the flexure nature of the quasi - one - dimensional configuration of the nanowire,@xcite @xmath35 is a coefficient determined by the tersoff potential . if a mode in ssinw is pinched - off from the middle , the transverse mode confined in the left or right arm is degenerated , whose frequencies are @xmath36 , i.e @xmath37 .",
    "this is the origin of the pinched - off transverse mode in the ksinw .",
    "similar to the @xmath31 modes in the ksinw , the pinching effect is observed in the tw modes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_u ]  ( d ) .",
    "since the frequency for the tw mode is inversely proportional to the length of the nanowire ( fig .",
    "[ fig_phonon_110_d_11 ] ) , the frequency of the tw modes in the ksinw is almost twice the frequency in the ssinw .    as a result of the pinching effect , the heat energy carried by the @xmath31 and the tw modes is difficult to be transported from the left arm to the right arm of the ksinw .",
    "the pinched phonon mode is a new type of localization mode .",
    "this is the main reason for the reduction of the thermal conductivity by kinks in the ksinw .",
    "the dependence of the reduction in the thermal conductivity of a ksinw with fixed axial length ( @xmath38 ) on kinks shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_kappa_narm ] can be understood as follows : on the one hand , there are more pinching effects in ksinw with more kinks , so the thermal conductivity becomes smaller with increasing kink number ; on the other hand , the arm length is shorter for ksinw with more kinks , and the pinching effect is weaker in ksinw of shorter arm length as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_u_short ] .",
    "the arm length for the ksinw studied in fig .",
    "[ fig_u_short ] is @xmath39 .",
    "we make a comparison between the frequencies in the ssinw ( @xmath40 ) and the ksinw ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath42 and @xmath43 , for the @xmath31 and the tw modes , respectively .",
    "this provides a direct evidence for the weaker pinching effect in ksinw with shorter arm length , because it is expected that @xmath44 and @xmath45 in case of a strong pinching effect such as that in fig .",
    "[ fig_u ] . related to this weaker pinching effect ,",
    "the vibrating amplitude of the atoms in the kink region starts to arise , which induces a tunneling phenomenon of this mode at the kink .",
    "this tunneling effect facilitates the heat delivery across the kink , thus enhancing the thermal conductivity of the ksinw .",
    "the interplay between the pinching enhancement effect ( due to increasing kink number ) and the tunneling enhancement effect ( due to the shortening of arm length ) yields the minimum thermal conductivity in fig .",
    "[ fig_kappa_narm ] .",
    "we would like to stress that lower thermal conductivity in nanowires is essential for their application in thermoelectric materials .",
    "there are some other methods to reduce the thermal conductivity , besides the phonon pinching effect discussed in present work .",
    "for example , nika _",
    "et.al _ demonstrated the importance of the phonon filtering effect on the thermal conductivity in one - dimensional superlattice nanowires.@xcite they found very low thermal conductivity , because significant number of phonon modes are filtered out from thermal transport .",
    "the thermal conductivity can be further manipulated by combing the phonon pinching and other effects ( eg . phonon filtering ) in nanowires .",
    "we have performed md simulation to study the heat transport in the ksinw .",
    "we observe that the thermal conductivity in the ksinw is insensitive to the temperature , since the heat transport in ksinw is mainly limited by the phonon scattering at the kink interface .",
    "we found that the thermal conductivity can be reduced by kinks in the ksinw for @xmath0 compared to that of the ssinw at room temperature and the reduction can be further increased at lower temperature . by comparatively investigating the phonon modes in ssinw and ksinw",
    ", we disclose the underlying mechanism for the reduction of the thermal conductivity to be the kink - induced interchanging effect between la and @xmath31 modes and the pinching effect on @xmath31 and the tw modes in the ksinw . both interchanging and pinching",
