    "more recently , interest has grown because of the burgeoning possibilities in the so - called field of _ spintronics _ , where the spin degree of freedom is specifically exploited for potential applications.@xcite control of spin will require coupling to the orbital motion , and hence spin - orbit coupling may play a critical role in understanding and exploiting various properties of such systems .",
    "spin - orbit coupling , as described by rashba,@xcite is expected to be prominent in two dimensional systems that lack inversion symmetry , including surface states .",

    "they found that the effective mass generally decreases as a function of spin - orbit coupling , @xmath0 ; however , in the weak electron - phonon coupling limit , there is initially an increase in effective mass , in agreement with cappelluti et al .",

    "the standard formulation for spin - orbit interaction uses two different types of electronic band structure .",
    "the first is free electron - like , which results in parabolic bands,@xcite and the second is tight - binding , which results in a periodic momentum dependence . while it is essentially always the case that the latter tends to the former for low electron fillings , this is not quite true when a rashba - type spin - orbit interaction term is present . as shown in ref .",
    "[ ] , for example , the ground state for a single electron consists of a degenerate ring around the @xmath1point .",
