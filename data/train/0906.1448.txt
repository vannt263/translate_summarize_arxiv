    "<S> it can be specifically stated as `` how can we know the source information such as the number of particles , their geometrical shape and motion from observations of gravitational waves ? '' </S>",
    "<S> this problem is analogous to the well - known one for the sound , which was raised by kac in his celebrated paper @xcite entitled `` _ can one hear the shape of a drum ? _ '' seeking an answer is beyond the scope of this paper . as a specific issue which is related with the inverse problem , we shall examine gravitational radiation by a certain class of orbital motion of self - gravitating objects . in the near future , direct detections of gravitational ripples </S>",
    "<S> ( and consequently gravitational waves astronomy ) will come true owing to a lot of efforts by the on - going or designed detectors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most promising astrophysical sources is inspiraling and finally merging binary compact stars . </S>",
    "<S> numerical relativity has succeeded in simulating merging neutron stars and black holes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> analytic methods also have nicely prepared accurate waveform templates for inspiraling compact binaries , notably by the post - newtonian approach ( see @xcite for reviews ) and also by the black hole perturbations especially at the linear order in mass ratio ( see also @xcite for reviews ) . </S>",
    "<S> bridges between the inspiraling stage and the final merging phase are currently under construction ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> there is a growing interest in potential astrophysical sources of gravitational waves involving 3-body interactions ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that even the classical three - body ( or n - body ) problem in newtonian gravity admits an increasing number of solutions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> some of the orbits are regular , while the others are chaotic . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we focus on several periodic orbits of three body system ; lagrange s triangle , henon s criss - cross and moore s figure - eight , which are explained later ( see also fig . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 ) . here </S>",
    "<S> , it should be noted that nakamura and oohara @xcite studied numerically the luminosity of gravitational radiation by n test particles orbiting around a schwarzshild black hole , as an extension of detweiler s analysis of the @xmath4 case @xcite by using teukolsky equation @xcite , in order to show the phase cancellation effect , which had been pointed out by nakamura and sasaki @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their n particles are _ test _ masses but not self - gravitating . another inverse problem of reconstructing the gravitational wave signal from the noisy data acquired by a network of detectors has been discussed ( e.g. , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> our aim and setting are completely different from those of the existing works .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this paper is ( 1 ) to point out a case where very similar shapes of waves are generated accidentally by different numbers of particles and ( 2 ) to show that the usage of higher multipole contributions will be necessary for distinguishing such sources . in order to track the evolution of the waveforms </S>",
    "<S> , we shall define the chirp mass so as to extend to a three - body system . </S>",
    "<S> thereby , we shall show that the octupole order is required to disentangle such very similar waveforms that coincide with each other at the quadrupole level . </S>",
    "<S> this will suggest that theoretical waveforms including sufficiently higher @xmath0-th order multipole will be important for classification of sources generating such similar waveforms ( with a conjecture about @xmath0 and @xmath2 ) .    throughout this paper , we take the units of @xmath5 .      +        _ some periodic orbits for three - body systems. _ for simplicity , we assume that the motion of massive bodies follows the newtonian equation of motion . </S>",
    "<S> it is impossible to describe all the solutions to the three - body problem even for the @xmath6 potential , as mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest periodic solutions for this problem were discovered by euler ( 1765 ) and by lagrange ( 1772 ) . the euler s solution is a collinear solution , in which the masses are collinear at every instant with the same ratios of their distances . </S>",
    "<S> the lagrange s one is an equilateral triangle solution in which each mass moves in an ellipse in such a way that the triangle formed by the three bodies revolves . </S>",
    "<S> let us take as another interesting solution the so - called criss - cross orbit found by henon in 1976 @xcite ( see also @xcite for the initial condition for each mass and recent extensions of the solution ) .    </S>",
    "<S> since the figure - eight solution was found first by moore by topological classification @xcite , choreographic solutions have recently attracted increasing interests in astronomy , mathematics and physics , where a solution is called choreographic if every massive particles move periodically in a single closed orbit . </S>",
    "<S> the figure - eight solution is that three bodies move periodically in a single figure - eight @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of such a figure - eight orbit was proven by chenciner and montgomery @xcite , where the numerical initial condition for each mass is also given . </S>",
    "<S> this odd solution is remarkably stable in newtonian gravity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> heggie discussed a formation mechanism as an outcome from scattering of two binaries @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> eventually its unicity up to scaling and rotation has been recently proven @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the trick figure eight remains true even if we consider the general relativistic effects at the post - newtonian order @xcite and also at the second post - newtonian one @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is a marked contrast to a binary case , which produces a complicated flowerlike pattern by the periastron advance in einstein gravity . </S>",
