    "the observation of clustering depends on whether ( i ) a sm state lies within the narrow energy window resulting from the competition between the continuum coupling and the centrifugal potential ; and ( ii ) its lifetime is sufficiently long to be detected . for sm states coupled to the cluster decay channel in low partial waves ( @xmath60 ) , the window of opportunity for neutral - particle clustering",
    "is situated in a narrow energy range around the turning point at the neutral - cluster decay threshold . for higher partial waves ( @xmath61 ) , this energy window moves above the neutral - cluster decay threshold , but an experimental observation of clustering",
    "is compromised by the rapid decrease of lifetimes of such configurations .",
    "the existence of multi - neutron clustering is an old problem in low - energy nuclear physics .",
    "recently , this problem has been revived in ref .",
    "@xcite , who reported the observation of neutron clusters in the disintegration of beryllium and lithium nuclei .",
    "it was claimed that correlated four neutrons observed in the disintegration of @xmath62be could be related to a four - neutron halo in this nucleus .",
    "this report spurred significant theoretical work , which rejected the existence of bound tetraneutron as being incompatible with our understanding of nuclear forces @xcite ( see , however , a discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite of a two - dineutron molecule ) .",
    "the isospin structure of the nuclear force prevents the existence of stable nuclei made of like - nucleons .",
    "it also explains the energetic order of decay channels , e.g. , ensures that a 4n - emission threshold is above 2n- and/or 1n - emission thresholds .",
    "however , the nature of nuclear forces does not preclude the manifestation of tetraneutron correlations in the vicinity of the 4n - emission threshold .",
    "the tetraneutron clustering may arise as a consequence of the collective coupling of many - body resonances via the 4n - emission channel . since at energies close to the 4n - emission channel",
    "both 1n- and 2n - emission channels are open , the tetraneutron correlations can be influenced by the coupling to these channels as well .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the creation of multi - neutron cluster states is analogous to that behind the presence of charged clusters and involves the aligned near - threshold state .",
    "the degree of collectivity of the aligned state depends on the strength of the continuum coupling , the density of sm states , the structure of the emission channel , and the energy of the aligned state relative to the threshold . for @xmath38 neutron decay channels , the collectivity of the aligned state is directly related to the energy gap between the aligned state and higher - lying states with the same quantum numbers . for channels with higher angular momenta ( @xmath63 ) ,",
    "the optimal energy window for the formation of a collective multi - neutron state is pushed above the decay threshold , and the possibility to find such a state is small .",
    "we have demonstrated that the point of the maximum continuum - coupling energy is related to the turning point of all ets involving the aligned state .",
    "this point coalesces with the emission threshold for sm states coupled to @xmath38 neutron decay channels .",
    "the energy of the turning point weakly depends on the continuum - coupling strength and the masses of particles involved .",
    "hence , contrary to the charged - particle clustering predicted to disappear in heavier nuclei @xcite , the multi - neutron correlations around the @xmath38 multi - neutron decay threshold are expected to appear along the whole nuclear landscape .",
    "unfortunately , the presence of strong multi - neutron correlations is expected only in a narrow energy range around the threshold thus making their experimental detection challenging .",
    "the closest approximation to a genuine multi - neutron cluster states are 2n - halos . however , 2n - separation energies in all experimentally studied cases are too large to speak of genuine dineutron cluster configurations @xcite .",
    "the experimental observation of multi - neutron clustering remains , therefore , a challenging open question for future investigations .",
