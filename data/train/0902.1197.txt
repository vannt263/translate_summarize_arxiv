    "thermodynamic properties of a material with reduced dimensionality can be markedly different from the bulk properties.@xcite the melting temperature @xmath2 of materials confined to nano - meter size can , for example , be significantly different from the bulk melting temperature @xmath3 . since the first experimental evidence,@xcite melting of nano - scale metal clusters has been a case study  @xcite , involving a number of experimental techniques such as transmission electron microscopy ( tem),@xcite x - ray diffraction , @xcite scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm),@xcite and calorimetric methods.@xcite for a recent review on size dependent melting see ref .  .",
    "for free standing particles a depressed melting temperature @xmath4 proportional to the inverse radius @xmath1 is typically observed .",
    "however , a number of new investigations have reported a possibility of a non - linear relationship between @xmath5 and @xmath1 when the particles are sufficiently small.@xcite these contradictory results give rise to the fundamental question : what is really controlling the depressed melting temperature ?",
    "several phenomenological models address the question of size dependent melting temperature.@xcite the problem is complicated by the fact that different crystal faces have different surface energies and by the occurrence of surface premelting  @xcite that depends on the surface energies . in this paper",
    "we present an experimental sample geometry that , as we will see , avoids these complications .",
    "we use transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) to investigate the size dependent melting point of nano - sized cone shaped aluminium needles as a function of the apex angle . the interface between solid and liquid aluminium was found to have a spherical topology thus the problem of crystal facets is eliminated . for a needle with fixed apex angle @xmath6",
    "we find a linear relation between the depressed melting temperature @xmath7 and the inverse radius @xmath1 of the spherical solid - liquid interface similar to the observations for spherical particles where @xmath8 in which case @xmath9 is a size - independent constant .",
    "however , by varying the apex angle we show that the proportionality constant @xmath9 changes significantly .",
    "this implies that the depressed melting is not solely controlled by the inverse radius .",
    "instead , we argue that the depressed melting is determined by the ratio between the solid - liquid interface area and the molten volume .",
    "samples with cone shaped aluminium needles were fabricated , from 99.99@xmath10 pure aluminium , using the so - called ion digging method.@xcite a suspension of fine diamond powder was dispersed on the vertical edge of a 0.1 mm thin al semi - disk ( 3 mm diameter ) .",
    "the samples were mounted in an ion milling machine equipped with a nitrogen cooled stage . sputtering with argon ions in the disk plane results in formation of thin needles at areas initially protected by diamond particles that were eventually sputtered completely away . with this technique cone shaped al needles with apex angles of @xmath1120 - 50 degrees and diameters at the needle point around @xmath1120 - 30 nm could be fabricated , see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) and ( b1 ) .",
    "a schematic illustration of this lithographic mask technique together with some preliminary results on sn needles were given in ref .  .",
    "in order to avoid evaporation , of aluminium , during the _ in situ _ heating experiment the whole surface of the needle samples were coated with a 50 - 80 nm thick amorphous carbon layer in a plasma coating apparatus.@xcite in addition to protecting the needles , the carbon coating also helps to maintain the cone shape of the liquid phase during the _ in situ _ experiment .",
    "all samples were examined in a jeol 200cx transmission electron microscope ( tem ) using an operating voltage of 200kv and the _ in situ _ melting experiment was performed by making use of a side - entry heating holder . the temperature was recorded with a thermocouple ( pt - ptrh 13@xmath10 ) placed in contact with the specimen cartridge .",
    "the errors that could occur in the temperature measurements , due to for example electron irradiation , are systematically small and do not disturb the real physical tendencies.@xcite conventional bright - field and dark - field imaging techniques were used to observe the solid - liquid interface .",
    "in this paper , we are going to study the melting process of four al needles with apex angles @xmath1226 , 29 , 36 and 42 degrees .",
    "however , we start by inspecting the tem micrographs of needles with @xmath13 and @xmath14 recorded at @xmath15  k before the melting initiates at @xmath16 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) and ( b1 ) .",
    "both needles display a high degree of symmetry which is further supported by the symmetry of the thickness fringes .",
    "these tem images therefore demonstrate that the needles have an almost perfect conical shape . to inspect the images more carefully",
    "it is useful to plot the intensity profile along the central axis of the needle as indicated by the vertical dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b1 ) . moving from the thick part of the needle ( top of fig .",
    "[ fig1](b1 ) ) towards the needle tip , the intensity displays a period oscillatory behavior ( fig .  [",
    "fig1](b2 ) ) that stems from the thickness that varies along the needle .",
    "eventually the intensity displays a discontinuity at the point between the needle tip and the carbon coat as indicated by the top horizontal dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b1 ) and ( b2 ) . finally , the intensity varies slowly without any oscillations along the carbon coat due to its amorphous structure , see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b2 ) .",
    "now we turn to discuss the finite size melting of the needles in the temperature range @xmath17 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c1 ) and ( d1 ) we show the same needle as in fig .  [ fig1](b1 ) but recorded at @xmath18  k and @xmath19  k , respectively . in both cases the tip of the needle is molten .",
    "this fact is also visualized by the intensity profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c2 ) and ( d2 ) .",
    "the discontinuity between the needle tip and the carbon coat is no longer visible and another discontinuity appears at a thicker part of the needle , see fig .",
    "[ fig1](c2 ) and ( d2 ) .",
    "we interpret this in terms of a melting process where the top part of the needle is molten and the discontinuity of the intensity profile now marks the interface between solid and liquid aluminium . as neither the liquid aluminium nor the amorphous carbon coat have any crystal structure we can not easily distinguish these two elements from our bright - field images .",
    "this explains why the discontinuity that appears at the needle tip for @xmath20 disappears for @xmath21 .",

    "a careful inspection of the image shown in fig .  [ fig1](c ) reveals that the first dark fringe , in contrast to the other dark thickness fringes , has a circular shape .",
    "this fringe indicates the position of the solid - liquid interface and it strongly suggests that it has a spherical topology .",
    "this was further confirmed by bright - field images taken with six times higher magnification shown in fig . [ fig1](e)-(g ) . as the temperature increases from @xmath18  k in fig .",
    "[ fig1](e ) to @xmath26  k in fig .",
    "[ fig1](g ) , the solid - liquid interface area becomes larger as the melting front moves towards the thicker part of the needle .",
    "however , the solid - liquid interface remains spherical at all the observed temperatures .",
    "finally we emphasize that during alternating heating and cooling cycles no hysteresis was observed between melting and solidification  indicating that the system is in a true equilibrium at all temperatures .",
    "furthermore , the system does not seem to favor surface premelting since no precursor of the melting could be detected .",
    "we are now going to describe the interface between the solid and liquid phases in greater detail . since the solid - liquid interface forms a spherical cap at each temperature @xmath17",
    ", one can extract a cap height @xmath27 and a spherical radius @xmath28 directly from the tem micrographs as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](g ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](a ) we show the cap ratio @xmath29 as a function of the reduced temperature @xmath30 for the needles with @xmath31 , and 42@xmath32 .",
    "this reveals the following important facts : _",
    "( i ) _ the cap ratio @xmath33 is essentially temperature independent for each of the needles and _ ( ii ) _ the cap ratio @xmath33 decreases systematically with increasing apex angle @xmath6 .",
    "this implies that the cap geometry remains unchanged as the melting front moves towards the thicker part of a needle with fixed @xmath6 .",
    "however , the cap ratio @xmath33 varies systematically as a function of apex angle @xmath6 . for each of the needles",
    "@xmath25 was extracted by constant fits to the data , see dashed lines in fig .",

    "( b ) the melting rate @xmath36 as a function of apex angle @xmath6 .",

    "the temperature @xmath39 leads to a corresponding increase ( decrease ) in the radius @xmath38 of the spherical interface .",
    "thus the temperature @xmath39 associated with @xmath38 is in fact the melting temperature @xmath40 of the spherical solid - liquid interface . by controlling the temperature @xmath41 and measuring @xmath0 on the tem micrographs , it is possible to track the size dependent melting temperature @xmath40 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ fig : melt ] displays the reduced melting temperature @xmath34 as a function of the inverse radius @xmath1 . as for spherical metal particles there",

    "[ fig : melt](a ) shows the depressed melting temperature of aluminium particles supported by a substrate@xcite and the needle shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b1 ) .",
    "the shared linearity might however be a coincidence since the proportionality constant @xmath9 seems to depend strongly on the apex angle @xmath6 . by linear fits to the data , see dashed lines in fig.[fig : melt](a ) , @xmath9 was extracted for all the studied needles .",
    "the result of these fits , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : melt](b ) and table  [ tab : tab1 ] , reveals that @xmath36 increases significantly when the apex angle @xmath6 is increased from 26@xmath43 to 42@xmath43 .",
    "this implies that for a given radius @xmath0 the reduced melting temperature @xmath7 may vary dramatically .",
    "thus the melting of the spherical interface is not controlled by the local thickness of the needle .",
    "this conclusion is further supported directly from the tem images since the melting front does not follow the contours of the thickness fringes .",
    "we now turn to discuss the melting process from simple geometric considerations assuming that the needles have a perfect conical shape . the cap ratio @xmath44 relates , in this case , to the apex angle @xmath6 by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the contact angle between the carbon coat and the solid - liquid interface .",
    "the fact that the cap ratio @xmath25 is approximately temperature independent for a fixed apex angle @xmath6 implies that @xmath46 remains constant as the melting front moves towards the thicker part of the needle . assuming that we know @xmath6 with a reasonable degree of precision ( @xmath47 ) one can thus derive the contact angle @xmath46 from a constant fit to the data as shown by dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "we find that @xmath48 is systematically small ( @xmath49 ) for all the studied needles , see table  [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "in fact @xmath46 is smaller or comparable to the estimated error of @xmath6 , it is therefore reasonable to assume that @xmath50 . the solid line in fig .  [ fig : fig3](b ) shows @xmath25 calculated from eq .  [ eq : contactangle ] with @xmath51 .",
    "next we are going to discuss the ratio between the molten volume and the solid - liquid interface area . for a given temperature @xmath17",
    "we observed a spherical solid - liquid interface with radius @xmath0 .",
    "now , if the temperature increases to @xmath52 , a part of the solid volume is going to melt .",

    "hence @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the latent heat per unit volume , @xmath66 is the latent heat of fusion , and @xmath67 ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) is the solid - liquid ( solid - coat , liquid - coat ) interface energy .",

    "notice that for one needle @xmath23 the contact angle @xmath46 has a small negative value which is an unphysical result .",

    "@xcite these values should , however , be compared cautiously because _ ( i ) _ different models have been used and _ ( ii ) _ the shape of metal particles on a substrate may not be perfectly spherical due to the presence of the substrate _",
    "i.e. _ the exact surface area to molten volume ratio is typically not specified .",

    "however , if we instead assume @xmath86 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath87 , the model would capture the data equally well albeit @xmath88  mj / m@xmath80 .",
    "the exact value of @xmath67 therefore rely strongly on the relatively unknown interface energies of the carbon coat .",
    "in summary , we have reported on the melting of aluminium when confined to nano - sized needles .",
    "the melting initiates at the needle tip and an equilibrium solid - liquid interface could be followed as the melting front moves towards the thicker part of the needle with increasing temperatures .",
    "the solid - liquid interface has a spherical topology _",
    "i.e. _ the interface forms a spherical cap . for a needle with fixed apex angle",
    "the melting is found to be proportional to the inverse radius of the spherical cap .",
    "however , by varying the apex angle we showed that the proportionality constant depends on the ratio between the solid - liquid interface area and the molten volume . this lead us to conclude that the _ finite size _ melting of aluminium is controlled merely by the surface area to molten volume ratio rather than the actual local size of the system .",
