    "[ fig_current_ad](b ) , the relevant transmissions from right to left in this case are stronger than those without modulation , since the increase of @xmath90 makes more states in the subband in the ac - field - applied region contribute to these transmissions through the sideband effect .",

    "the difference between the transmissions with and without the cutoff energy becomes more pronounced in the presence of the ac field . in particular , some pronounced peaks appear in the transmissions with the cutoff energy as indicated by the green and blue arrows , which should be absent if calculated properly .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood via the tien - gordon theory,@xcite which is valid for a weak energy dependence of the self - energy from the leads .",

    "the pronounced peaks in the transmission are formed as indicated by the blue arrows . moreover ,",
    "when the ac field is strong enough , the decreasing trend from the cutoff energy is always dominant .",
    "thus , the pronounced peak moves to the dirac point as indicated by the green arrow .",
    "based on the above discussions , one can conclude that this kind of peaks , which also appear in fig .",
    "2(a ) in ref .",
    ", are just the artificial results caused by the introduction of the cutoff energy .",
    "similar problems can be found in the field - strength dependence of the time - averaged current .",

    "[ fig_com](b ) .",
    "it is shown that without a cutoff energy , the currents in both configurations increase monotonically with increasing @xmath25 .",
    "this feature is from the increasing weight of the sidebands outside the energy regime between the fermi energies of two leads , where the field - free transmissions are larger than those inside this energy regime as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_com](a ) .",
    "however , after the introduction of the cutoff energy , the behaviour becomes very different : the currents first increase and then decrease with increasing @xmath25 .",
    "the decrease at high @xmath25 is from the increasing weight of the sideband beyond the cutoff energy , where field - free transmission is zero .",
    "this means that this decrease , which also appears in fig .",
