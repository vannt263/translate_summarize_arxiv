    "the running coupling constant @xmath0 becomes small at sufficiently high temperatures .",
    "it therefore seems plausible that one can understand the quark - gluon plasma using perturbative methods .",
    "the free energy of qcd has been calculated to fifth order in the weak - coupling expansion  @xcite . for a pure - glue plasma",
    "the result is @xmath1 , \\label{f1-qcd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the free energy of an ideal gas of massless gluons and @xmath3 is the running coupling constant in the @xmath4 scheme . in fig .",
    "[ weakfig ] , the free energy is shown as a function of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the critical temperature for the deconfinement phase transition . the weak - coupling expansions through orders @xmath0 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are shown as bands that correspond to varying the renormalization scale @xmath10 by a factor of two from the central value @xmath11 .",
    "the successive approximations to the free energy alternate in sign and the perturbative expansion does not converge for temperatures that are relevant for heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the @xmath7 contribution is smaller than the @xmath0 contribution only if @xmath12 is larger than @xmath13 gev , while the temperatures at rhic are expected not to exceed @xmath14 gev .",
    "the poor convergence of the perturbative series is somewhat surprising since very accurate lattice results  @xcite indicate that the quark - gluon plasma can be approximated quite well by an ideal gas unless the temperature is very close to @xmath6 .",

    "the free energy approaches that of an ideal gas from below as @xmath5 increases .",
    "l[0pt]9 cm = 7.3 cm    there are several ways of reorganizing the perturbative series to improve its convergence .",
    "one of the most successful approaches for scalar field theories is `` screened perturbation theory ''  @xcite which is an expansion around an ideal gas of massive quasiparticles .",
    "the convergence for the free energy is very good even for large values of the coupling constant .",
    "evidence that such a reorganization might be useful in qcd is provided by the success of quasi - particle models .",
    "the analyses in  @xcite indicate that lattice results for thermodynamic functions can be fit very well by a gas of massive quarks and gluons with temperature dependent masses of order @xmath12 .",
    "the quasi - particle models , however , suffer from several theoretical inconsistencies because introducing thermal masses by hand violates gauge invariance .",
    "there is a way of incorporating plasma effects , such as quasi - particle masses , screening of interactions , and landau damping , into perturbative calculations , while maintaing gauge invariance , and that is by using hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) perturbation theory .",
    "htl perturbation theory was originally developed to sum up all higher loop corrections that are leading order in @xmath15 for amplitudes having soft external lines with momenta of order @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "if it is applied to amplitudes with hard external lines with momenta of order @xmath12 , it selectively resums corrections that are higher order in @xmath15 .",
    "this resummation is a generalization of screened perturbation theory that respects gauge invariance .",
    "it corresponds to expanding around an ideal gas of massive quark and gluon quasiparticles .",
    "a significant advantage of htl perturbation theory over the approach using lattice gauge theory calculations is that it can be readily applied to the real - time processes that are the most promising signatures of a quark - gluon plasma . due to the euclidean formulation ,",
    "lattice methods are restricted to calculating static quantities such as the free energy  @xcite and the debye mass  @xcite .",
