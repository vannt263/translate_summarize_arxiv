    "in the unification schemes of radio loud agn , the reason for the difference between high power ( fr ii radio galaxies and quasars ) and low power ( fr is and bl lacertae objects ) sources is still a puzzling subject . in particular , it is not yet clear if it is related to evolutionary properties , to differences in the physical state of the central black hole ( bh , see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and/or to a different interaction between the relativistic jet and the interstellar medium @xcite .    in this context , the study of bl lac sources is important for many reasons .",
    "first , bl lacs are not well studied in the radio band and their physical properties in this band are not yet well known .",
    "for instance , detailed vlbi studies on bl lacs are available only for the bright objects of the 1 jy sample @xcite and a few other outstanding sources @xcite . in spite of this lack of high resolution data ,",
    "bl lacs are ideal objects to be observed with vlbi , since they are beamed objects and represent a good laboratory to look for evidence of the presence of relativistic jets in low power radio sources @xcite .    in order to investigate this class of agn",
    ", we selected a sample of nearby bl lacs from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) snapshot image survey @xcite .",
    "the sample is composed of 30 objects with redshift @xmath2 ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  hereinafter paper i ) . at these low redshifts ,",
    "the hst separates the contribution of the central core and of the host galaxy ; in the radio , we can probe with vlbi the parsec scale relativistic jet .",
    "moreover , we can study low power objects that are weak in the radio , with a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) peaking at high @xmath3 ( hbls ) ; in the inverse compton part of their sed , some members of the sample reach even the tev domain .",
    "by contrast , their radio power is extremely low , which makes them comparable to radio quiet objects , when we consider their de - beamed luminosity .    in",
    ", we presented vla and vlba observations for 15 objects .",
    "we have discussed some of the basic radio properties of the sample and we have made a first estimate of the parsec scale jet properties . in the present paper we present new observations of nine objects with the european vlbi network ( evn ) and the merlin , including unpublished images of mrk  421 .",
    "moreover , we take advantage of the data from the hst snapshot survey and from x - ray satellites , in order to discuss the properties of the sample from a broadband perspective .    the paper is laid out as follows :  [ sample ] contains a summary of the results of and introduces the new data - sets ; in  [ results ] , we present the results of the new observations and details about individual sources ; in  [ discussion ] , we discuss the broadband properties of the sample ; finally ,  [ conclusions ] summarizes the main conclusions of the present work . throughout the paper , we make use of h@xmath4 = 70 km sec@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , @xmath6 = 0.3 and @xmath7 = 0.7 .",
    "spectral indexes are defined such that @xmath8 .",
    "based on the hst snapshot survey of bl lac objects @xcite , we have selected a sample of 29 bl lac objects with low redshift ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "we point out that the sample considered in was composed of 30 sources .",
    "however , thanks to our analysis , we have been able to discard one object from the sample , that is not a genuine bl lac : we reject 0145 + 138 from the sample , on the basis of its low core dominance ( @xmath10 ) and of the lack of an unresolved nuclear component in the optical hst image .",
    "more observations and an optical spectrum would be desirable in order to understand its true nature .",
    "we also note that some objects ( e.g. 0521@xmath11365 , 2201 + 044 ) have optical spectra showing emission and absorption lines and are similar to seyfert 1 spectra but with lines of lower luminosity . in total",
    ", we have 7 sources with low frequency synchrotron peak ( lbl ) , and 22 hbls .",

    "the hosts are virtually all massive elliptical galaxies ( average luminosity @xmath23 and effective radius r@xmath24 = 10 kpc ) typically located in poor groups . in spite of the presence of the active nucleus",
    ", the host galaxy appears in most cases to be a completely `` normal '' elliptical galaxy .",
    "moreover , the data have shown that no significant difference is present between the hosts of hbls and those of lbls .",

    "the stations involved were effelsberg ( 100 m ) , jodrell bank ( mkii , @xmath25 m ) , medicina ( 32 m ) , noto ( 32 m ) , onsala ( 25 m ) , sheshan ( 25 m ) , torun ( 32 m ) , westerbork ( @xmath26 m ) , and urumqi ( 25 m ) .",
    "each source was observed for @xmath27 minutes , divided into four scans at different hour angles to obtain a good @xmath28 coverage .",
    "the data were correlated at the joint institute for vlbi in europe ( jive ) in dwingeloo .",
    "we imported the data in the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) astronomical image processing system ( aips ) and performed the a priori calibration .",
    "finally , we edited the data and produced the images within difmap ; the final restoring beams , 3@xmath29 noise levels , and image peaks are reported in table [ imagedata ] .",
    "two of the sources ( 1215 + 303 and 1728 + 502 ) were also observed at 5 ghz with the evn and the merlin simultaneously on 2002 may 26th .",
    "the evn array involved in the experiment includes the same telescopes of the evn only observation , plus the 32  m antenna in cambridge ; this antenna provides a baseline to jodrell bank , common to the merlin array as well .",
    "each source was observed for 6 hours , in 42 scans , switching between the two targets .",
    "the merlin data have been processed at jodrell bank observatory with the local dprograms ; difmap has been used to produce the images .",
    "the evn data were correlated in dwingeloo and reduced in the standard manner within aips ( for initial calibration ) and difmap ( for the imaging part ) . finally , the combination of the two dataset has been done within aips , using the task dbcon .",

    "moreover , we present here unpublished data for 1101 + 384 ( markarian 421 ) : ( i ) evn+merlin observations taken on 1997 feb 17 at 5 ghz : the evn telescopes involved in the observation were effelsberg , sheshan , cambridge , medicina , torun , and the vlba dish in saint croix ; the merlin array consisted of defford , cambridge , knockin , darnall , mkii at jodrell bank , and tabley ; we have about six hours of evn observations and three hours with the merlin , after flagging for down time , bad weather , receiver problems ; we followed the procedures outlined above for the data reduction of the evn and merlin data set and for their combination ; ( ii ) observations with the vlba plus a single vla dish ( vlba+y1 ) for 4 hours at 5 ghz on 1995 july 22 ; ( iii ) observations at 1.6 ghz on 1996 february 10 with a global array ( 6 vlba telescopes for 6 hours , including 3 hours at jodrell bank , medicina , noto , and onsala ) . a preliminary map based on this observation",
    "was presented by @xcite .",
    "see table [ merlindata ] for the restoring beam , peak and noise level of all our new images of mrk  421 .",
    "we show in fig .  [ fig1 ]",
    "the milliarcsecond scale images of the eight bl lacs observed at 1.6 ghz with the evn ; we report their relevant parameters in table  [ imagedata ] . typically , the sources are dominated by a compact core making up the largest fraction of the total flux density .",
    "jets are detected in seven out of eight sources , always single sided .",
    "this rate of jet detection ( 83% ) is higher than in the 5 ghz vlba observations of other objects of the sample .",
    "this may stem from both the longer exposure and brighter targets of the present observations .",
    "we also present several deep radio images at 5 ghz for 1215 + 303 ( fig .  [ fig1215 ] ) and 1728 + 502 ( fig .",

    "the jets are remarkably well aligned on scales from a few to some hundreds of parsecs ( projected ) . evidence of bending is present only in the inner parsecs of the jet of mrk 421 .",

    "these models have been obtained fitting circular gaussian components to the data using modelfit in difmap .",
    "we adopt circular gaussians because the signal to noise ratio is relatively low in most jets and we need to keep the number of parameters as low as possible .",
    "the models for the most compact and powerful components are typically better constrained than for weak and extended ones , although the various model parameters are not independent of each other .",
    "typically , components smaller than 10 mas have uncertainties on @xmath31 and @xmath32 of @xmath33 mas or less . for larger components ,",
    "uncertainties are estimated on the basis of the hpbw of the image and the component snr .",
    "for the flux densities , we estimate the uncertainty from the rms noise and the absolute flux calibration uncertainty ( @xmath34 ) added in quadrature .",
    "we then summarize in table  [ tab407 ] the main results about cores and jets properties , based on the new 1.6 and 5 ghz evn data , as well as on the 5 ghz vlba data presented in .",

    "the corresponding non - simultaneous spectral index is given in col .",

    "core flux densities have been derived from the fits of gaussian components to the data .",
    "the core flux density is expected to be slightly higher than the peak brightnesses of the images reported in table  [ imagedata ] because of the discrete map gridding . in a few cases ( 1133 + 704 , and 1215 + 303 )",
    ", the significantly larger core flux density indicates that there is some contamination from the jet . at full resolution",
    ", the different observing frequency brings about an excess of flux density in the 1.6 ghz data , mostly as a result of the different size of the synthesized beams . for a spectral index measurement ,",
    "we therefore consider our 5 ghz images ( either vlba or evn ) , limiting the @xmath28-range to @xmath37 m@xmath38 ; this yields a resolution comparable to the 1.6 ghz images .",
    "results are presented in table [ tab407 ] , with @xmath39 in the range between @xmath40 and 0.5 .",
    "note that the observations at 1.6 and 5 ghz are not simultaneous , so variability can account for part of the differences .",
    "all the sources display single - sided jets in both 1.6 and 5 ghz data , except for 1426 + 428 , which has a tentative jet detection only at 5 ghz @xcite . in most cases , we need only one component ( in addition to the core ) to model - fit the jet .",
    "we also measured flux densities and brightnesses directly on the images .",
    "since no object in the sample has a detectable counter - jet , the brightness ratios presented in table  [ tab407 ] are only lower limits based on the noise of the images .",
    "more details are given along with the source description in the next section .",
    "for 1215 + 303 , 1728 + 502 , and mrk  421 we have also obtained spectral index maps ( simultaneous in the case of 1215 + 303 and 1728 + 502 ) .",
    "cores are typically flat / inverted , while the jets are steeper in general .",

    "as is the case also in mrk  501 , the resolved and limb brightened structure of the jet makes it difficult to describe the jet with simple gaussian components .",
    "we have nonetheless tried to model - fit the data with circular gaussians , and we find that the inner jet is well described by a core plus three components ( see table  [ tab421 ] ) , in good agreement with results at higher frequency of @xcite .",

    "thanks to the new data presented here and in , we estimate the relevance of beaming in our sample of nearby bl lacs .",

    "we note that for any one source the relation may not hold , although in a statistical sense this shall be the most likely solution .    with this caveat in mind , we derive the intrinsic properties of the sources in our sample . in this way , we are able to discuss their physical properties and address the issue of the parent population . for example",
    ", we have shown in that the de - beamed nuclear radio luminosity are indistinguishable from those of a sample of fr  i radio galaxies , in addition to what is already well known about the extended radio luminosity .",
    "we will now adopt a broadband perspective and consider multi - wavelength data , which provide a tool to investigate the mechanisms involved in the nuclear activity .",
    "for the present sample , a wealth of information is available thanks to the optical observations performed with the hubble space telescope .",
    "in particular , for all the objects it has been possible to separate the contribution of a central compact core and of the host galaxy . both quantities have significant impact on our understanding of the bl lac phenomenon .",
    "the central compact core is a clear signature of the nuclear activity ; the host galaxy luminosity is a tool to estimate the mass of the central black hole @xcite .      in the following ,",
    "we adopt black hole mass estimates based on the host galaxies bulge luminosity .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , this method is preferable to those based on the correlation with the central stellar velocity dispersion @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "in fact , ( 1 ) direct measurements of @xmath29 in bl lacs are difficult to obtain and ( 2 ) indirect estimates of @xmath29 via the fundamental plane ( fp ) are highly inaccurate due to the intrinsic scatter of fp relation , as well as to the difficulties in determining the other observables in the fp .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : bh1 ] and [ fig : bh2 ] we therefore plot the black hole mass vs. radio power using the estimates of @xcite . in fig .",

    "[ fig : bh2 ] , we use the core power at 1.4 ghz : in the left panel we plot the observational data , in the right one we consider the de - beamed core luminosity , adopting a lorentz factor @xmath82 .",
    "since the intrinsic core luminosity correlates with the total power , we expect similar behaviors in figs .",
    "[ fig : bh1 ] and [ fig : bh2 ] ( right ) .",
    "neither the total nor the core radio power ( corrected and uncorrected ) seem to be good indicators of the black hole mass , as the same bh mass is found in objects with radio power more than two orders of magnitude apart .",
    "although weak , a trend of larger @xmath83 for more powerful radio sources is however present ; we also note that the corrected nuclear powers are spread over a narrow range , so that any possible correlation becomes harder to reveal .",
    "we plan in the near future to add lower power sources to the bl lacs to obtain a larger range .",
    "we report in table [ tab : bh ] the correlation coefficients for the present sample , describing the significance of the trends visible in the various plots . since both the radio power and the black hole mass ( estimated from host luminosity ) include a dependence on redshift , we give in col .",
    "( 3 ) also the coefficient corrected against @xmath84 and the corresponding probability of the null hypothesis in col .",
    "since this probability is relatively low , it is likely that a correlation between bh mass and radio power is actually present .",
    "the large scatter in the correlation , however , suggests that black hole mass alone is not a critical parameter for the emitted radio power in nearby bl lacs .",
    "@xcite have exploited hubble space telescope and radio data to discuss the physical properties of nuclei of low power radio galaxies , finding a linear correlation between optical and radio luminosity .",
    "this correlation is interpreted in terms of a common non thermal origin . @xcite",
    "have studied the nuclei of 3crr radio galaxies with similar tools , concluding that the emission is jet related and that their properties are related to those of bl lacs .",
    "our high quality radio data and the optical hst results @xcite allow us to extend this line of research , moving from the observational properties found in our sample of low redshift bl lacs .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : optical ] the comparison between optical and radio core luminosity for bl lacs , together with the correlation found by @xcite for fr  i nuclei .    the objects in the present sample span almost three orders of magnitude in observed radio core luminosity and the optical core luminosity increases linearly with it over this interval ( left panel ) .",
    "a strong correlation ( @xmath85 ) between optical and radio core luminosity emerges clearly .",
    "the flux densities correlate as well as the powers , confirming that this is not an artifact introduced by the common dependence on the luminosity distance ( see also the discussion on correlation between intrinsic luminosities in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we show here the luminosities only for the sake of homogeneity in the comparison with @xcite .",
    "this correlation supports the suggestion that , as in fr i radio galaxies , the emission in the two wavebands is ascribed to the same non thermal process , with negligible contribution from , e.g. , a thermal disk .",
    "however , the optical cores of bl lacs are about two magnitudes brighter than those of fr i galaxies with the same core radio luminosity .",
    "notice that we are plotting here _ observed _ values , i.e. quantities that are affected by beaming .",
    "while it is interesting to note that this keeps the correlation tight , we argue that this may be responsible for the optical offset observed for bl lacs .",
    "@xcite obtained a similar result from the bl lacs in the slew survey , while the lbl of the 1 jy sample result less displaced from the correlation than our objects .    in the right panel , we show the luminosities as corrected for the derived doppler factor . we assume for the optical emission a spectral index @xmath86 @xcite and for the radio core @xmath87 ( table [ tab407 ] ) .",
    "we also re - calculate the luminosities in the hypothesis of a viewing angle of @xmath88 , which is the average angle expected for the population of fr i radio galaxies used by @xcite to derive the correlation . as an effect of de - beaming , all the points move to lower radio and optical luminosities and approach the correlation for radio galaxies , with some scatter .",
    "this makes a strong point in favor of a common nature of bl lacs and fri radio galaxies cores .",
    "the little scatter left in the de - beamed values and in particular the systematic offset for hbl sources , though little , could be suggestive of some finer detail . for example , a two velocity jet ( fast spine and slower external layer , with different weights in lbl and hbl ) is a plausible solution that accounts also for other observational properties , such as limb brightening of jets @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that it would have been possible to use our vlbi data to calculate parsec scale radio luminosities .",
    "we have not done this for the sake of homogeneity in the comparison with fris .",
    "however , it will be interesting to reconsider the subject once we have parsec scale data for a large unbiased sample of low power radio galaxies , such as the bologna complete sample ( * ? ? ?",
    "* giroletti et al . in prep ) .",
    "figure [ fig : ledlow ] shows the distribution of the objects belonging to the present sample in the ledlow & owen diagram , in which the dashed line separates fr  i and fr  ii radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "when we consider the observed values ( left panel ) , about 20% of our nearby bl lacs fall in the fr ii domain or across the transition region .",
    "however , the core fraction of the total luminosity is still significant at 1.4 ghz , so we have to separate the core and extended radio luminosity and de - beam the former .",
    "we show the intrinsic quantities that we derive in this way in the right panel : most objects move deep into the region typical of fr i radio galaxies , leaving only three sources in the fr  ii and transition region : 0521@xmath11365 , 0829 + 046 , and 2200 + 420 ( all lbl ) .    in order to discuss the implication of this distribution in the ledlow & owen diagram",
    ", we consider again the relationship between optical magnitude of the host and bh mass as well as the one between radio power and total jet kinetic power @xcite .",
    "we can then interpret the diagram in terms of bh mass and jet power : for a given @xmath89 , fr iis have jets of total power above a certain value , which becomes larger for more massive black holes .",
    "in other words , there is a critical ratio between jet power and black hole mass that divides fr i and fr ii radio galaxies .",
    "our sources seem to produce radio jets of low kinetic power with respect to fsrq and fr ii radio galaxies with similar bh masses",
    ".    one can speculate about the interpretation of the fr  i / fr  ii dichotomy ; for example , @xcite have related the total radio power to the narrow emission line luminosity , which is directly produced by photo - ionization from the nuclear accreting radiation . using these correlations",
    ", one could estimate accretion rates for fris and bl lacs and speculate that they are sub - eddington systems with sub - critical accretion rates @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , line luminosity is generally not available for sources in our sample and the validity of such assumptions can not be established .",
    "a correlation between x - ray and radio emission is expected if there is a fundamental connection between accretion flows and jet activity .",
    "@xcite have considered a large sample of objects ( agn and x - ray binaries ) powered by super massive black holes ( smbh ) as well as galactic bhs . from the study of their radio core luminosity , 2 - 10 kev x - rays luminosity , and bh mass , a fundamental plane ( fp ) of bh activity",
    "however , bl lacs have been excluded from this study , since doppler boosting of the jet emission is expected to spoil the correlation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fp ] ( left panel ) , we show the position of our nearby bl lacs in the projection of the fp , as obtained from the observed ( i.e.  doppler boosted ) values : it is readily visible that the observed radio luminosities are well above the correlation . from the derived intrinsic de - beamed values ] , we then plot in the right hand panel the new @xmath90 vs. @xmath91 , recalculated in the case of a viewing angle of 60@xmath92 ( which is the average angle for the objects used to derive the correlation ) .",
    "the corrected data seem to cluster around the fp relation , albeit with a significant scatter in the points .",
    "although no systematic general offset is found , we note that lbls ( filled circles ) lie above / left of the correlation , while hbls are preferentially found below / right of it .",
    "it is thus interesting that agn with radio jets , as our bl lacs , do follow the same relation of the bulk of smbhs and galactic bhs .",
    "on one hand , it could support the existence of the general fundamental connection between accretion flows and jet activity @xcite . in this case ,",
    "the possible offset between lbls and hbls could be suggestive of possible refining of the proposed models , requiring more powerful radio jets in lbls or accreting process that is more radiatively efficient in hbls .",
    "on the other hand , it has been suggested that the fp relation is actually an artifact due to the flux - limited nature of the sample considered @xcite .",
    "once the doppler - boosting dependence has been removed , a common dependence on distance in the plotted quantities could become apparent .",
    "since our sample is volume - limited ( @xmath2 ) , rather than flux - limited , we should however be free from this bias : we have radio and x - ray fluxes spanning 3 orders of magnitude each ( radio fluxes between 7 mjy and 5 jy , and x - rays 2 - 10 kev fluxes between 0.4 and 240 erg @xmath93 s@xmath5 ) .",
    "we have presented new high resolution images for 9 bl lacs .",
    "parsec - scale images reveal an almost ubiquitous presence of one - sided jets . under the assumption of intrinsically symmetric jets",
    ", this provides evidence for relativistic velocities in the parsec scale region of jets .",
    "this result supports the previous findings on the same sample @xcite , and we conclude that the lorentz factors in the sample cluster around @xmath94 , mainly on the basis of the core dominance argument . in the best studied sources , thanks to the short baselines provided by the merlin , we study the jet out to several hundred parsecs , and still find no evidence of counter - jets . on kiloparsec scales ,",
    "the structure of 1728 + 502 remains aligned with the inner region direction , while 1215 + 303 and mrk  421 reveal a symmetric structure without a clear connection with the parsec scale jet . in mrk  421 we have evidence of limb brightening of the jet , from the very inner jet region ( @xmath72 mas from the core ) out to @xmath95 mas .",
    "this result , similar to what is found in the other tev source mrk  501 @xcite , is of great importance in the development of jet launch models and the study of the jet / environment interaction .",
    "x - ray fluxes and high resolution optical data available for our whole sample of 29 nearby bl lacs allow us to perform a multi - wavelength analysis .",
    "in particular , by resolving the host galaxy and separating the non - thermal core , we have been able to discuss the physical properties of the bl lac phenomenon . given the distance - limited nature of the present sample , we are confident of the robustness of our results , which we summarize as follows :    \\1 . there is a significant correlation between the mass of the central smbh and the radio luminosity , both nuclear and extended , independent of any common distance dependence .",
    "however , there is a large scatter in the correlation , so that radio luminosity alone can not be taken as an indicator of the bh mass .",
    "radio and optical nuclear luminosities ( and fluxes ) show a strong correlation , indicating a common origin for the emission at both wavelengths , i.e.  non thermal synchrotron radiation .",
    "moreover , if we de - beam the observed luminosities , the cores follow with little scatter the same correlation found for low power radio galaxies by @xcite , in strong support of the unification of bl lacs and fr  is based on orientation",
    "still in support of the bl lac / fr  i unification , our sources lie below the dividing line in the ledlow & owen diagram ; for any given @xmath89 , low redshift bl lacs have lower radio power than fr ii radio galaxies of similar @xmath89 .",
    "the radio and x - ray luminosities do not follow the fundamental plane of bh activity found for other super - massive and galactic bh , clearly because of the relevant doppler boosting of the jet .",
    "when we consider de - beamed quantities , the fp relation becomes quite well - reproduced , although some overall scatter and lbl - hbl offset appear .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for a constructive report that improved the clarity of the paper .",
