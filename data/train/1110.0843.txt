    "low energy observables sensitive to cp violation in @xmath9 transitions constitute excellent probes of possible new cp violating phases in extensions of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "indeed , as cp violation in such processes is predicted to be tiny in the sm , evidence for sizable cp violation in @xmath9 transitions would be a clear hint for the presence of new physics ( np ) .",
    "examples of such low energy probes are observables that are sensitive to the @xmath0 mixing phase , as the semi - leptonic asymmetry @xmath10 in decays of @xmath0 mesons to `` wrong sign leptons '' or the time dependent cp asymmetries in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 decays .    in the context of generic two higgs doublet models with minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) , where the ckm matrix is the only source of flavor violation , a large @xmath0 mixing phase",
    "can be realized if additional cp violating phases are allowed  @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , these models can also address tensions in fits of the ckm matrix that seem to indicate a sizable np contribution to the @xmath1 mixing phase  @xcite .",
    "possible relations between a non - standard @xmath0 mixing phase and the baryon asymmetry of the universe in these models have been studied in  @xcite .    in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) on the other hand ,",
    "a mfv soft sector is not sufficient to generate sizable np phases in meson mixing  @xcite due to the strong experimental bound on the @xmath5 branching ratio .",
    "non sm - like @xmath0 and @xmath1 mixing phases in the mssm require new sources of flavor violation in addition to the ckm matrix ( see e.g.  @xcite for studies of such frameworks ) .",
    "supersymmetric models with mfv _ can _ generate large @xmath11 mixing phases _ if _ they allow for a strongly reduced muon yukawa coupling such that the br@xmath12 constraint can be avoided . such a situation can be realized for example in the so - called uplifted susy higgs region  @xcite , even though this framework is strongly constrained by other @xmath11 physics observables and @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "as studied in detail in  @xcite , non - negligible corrections to cp violating observables in meson mixing can also be generated if the mssm with mfv is extended by the two leading higher dimensional operators in the higgs sector with complex coefficients  @xcite .",
    "still , the stringent bounds on br@xmath12 only allow for a @xmath0 mixing phase of @xmath14 in specific regions of parameter space of this model .",
    "in this work we analyze an extension of the mssm , introducing higher dimensional operators not exclusively in the higgs sector , but also considering dimension 5 operators that induce non - holomorphic higgs - fermion couplings already at the tree level  @xcite .",
    "such operators are a possible source of flavor and cp violation . assuming that these operators obey the minimal flavor violation ansatz  @xcite",
    ", we explore to which extent the considered framework allows for non - standard cp violation in @xmath11 mixing without being in conflict with the bounds on the br@xmath15 . for a study of a similar framework , that however does not consider cp violation in @xmath11 mixing , see  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 mixing amplitude @xmath17 consists on an dispersive part , @xmath18 , and an absorptive part , @xmath19 .",
    "the absorptive part is dominated by tree level sm contributions and therefore hardly affected in many np models . throughout this work",
    "we will assume that @xmath19 has no significant np contributions .",
    "the dispersive part @xmath18 on the other hand is highly sensitive to new heavy degrees of freedom .",
    "the effects of np in @xmath18 can be parametrized by @xmath20 the main impact of the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 is on the mass differences @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the np phases @xmath25 and @xmath26 affect observables that are sensitive to cp violation in b meson mixing , like the semileptonic asymmetries @xmath27 and @xmath28 as well as the time - dependent cp asymmetries in @xmath29 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in order to constrain the np parameters through measurements of these observables , knowledge of the respective sm contributions is required . as several of the observables ,",
    "in particular @xmath23 and @xmath30  the time dependent cp asymmetry in @xmath29  are a key ingredient in the determination of the unitarity triangle ( ut ) , a simultaneous fit of the ckm parameters and the np parameters as performed in  @xcite is the most consistent approach . here",
    "we focus mainly on the impact of the recent improvements on the determination of the @xmath0 mixing phase at cdf and d0  @xcite and in particular at lhcb  @xcite .",
    "as these measurements have no significant effect on the determination of the ckm parameters and the np parameters other than @xmath26 , we consider a simplified approach and take the ckm parameters as well as @xmath21 and @xmath22 from the generic np fit in  @xcite , and fit only the np parameters @xmath26 and @xmath25 .",
    "we expect this approach to give a good estimate of the allowed region of parameter space compatible with the present experimental data on b meson mixing .",
    "in particular we will use @xmath31 = ( 27.2^{+1.1}_{-3.1})^\\circ \\\\   \\beta_s & = & \\textnormal{arg}\\left [ ( v_{tb } v_{ts}^*)/(v_{cb } v_{cs}^*)\\right ] = ( -1.3\\pm 0.1)^\\circ \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the following @xmath32 bounds @xmath33 we now give expressions for the observables that are sensitive to cp violation in b meson mixing . for the semileptonic asymmetries",

    "interestingly enough , there is a ( 2 - 3)@xmath43 tension between the sm prediction of @xmath30  ( [ eq : spsiks ] ) and its experimental value  @xcite @xmath44 that is largely driven by the @xmath45 measurements that prefer a large value of @xmath46 .",
    "this tension points in the same direction for the np phase @xmath25 as the data on the like sign dimuon charge asymmetry .",

    "at the tree level , the mssm is a 2 higgs doublet model of type ii and the couplings of the neutral higgs bosons to fermions are flavor conserving . at the loop level on the other hand ,",

    "[ fig : asl ] we present the results of a parameter scan of the model .",
    "the left plot shows the correlation between the semi - leptonic asymmetries @xmath27 and @xmath27 , while the right plot shows the correlation between the time dependent cp asymmetries @xmath30 and @xmath52 .",
    "blue ( dark gray ) points correspond to a scenario where new sources of cp violation are arising entirely from the modified yukawa couplings and the higher dimensional operators in the superpotential  ( [ eq : super ] ) are switched off completely .",
    "we consider mass scales as in scenario i above and allow @xmath164 as well as epsilon parameters @xmath165 with @xmath142 and @xmath143 real and arbitrary phases for the remaining @xmath88 .",
    "as expected , in such a setup the np effects in @xmath0 mixing are much larger than in @xmath1 mixing and the lhcb bounds on @xmath166 exclude a sizable np phase in @xmath1 mixing .",
    "green ( light gray ) points correspond to a scenario where also the higher dimensional operators in the superpotential  ( [ eq : super ] ) are considered .",
    "we fix mass scales as in scenario ii above and allow the parameters @xmath167 with arbitrary phases and real epsilon parameters @xmath168 as well as @xmath164 . in this setup , the np contributions to cp violation in @xmath1 and @xmath0 mixing are comparable .",
    "consequently , a sizable np phase in @xmath1 mixing can be compatible with the lhcb constraints on the np phase in @xmath0 mixing . even though new cp phases come entirely from the superpotential operators , we stress that the presence of the khler potential operators is crucial .",
    "they allow for low @xmath66 values and therefore the constraint from @xmath60 can be avoided .",
    "we conclude that in order to generate sizable corrections to cp violation in @xmath1 mixing that are in agreement with the lhcb data on cp violation in @xmath0 mixing , both the higher dimensional operators in the superpotential ( that modify the higgs spectrum ) as well as the higher dimensional operators in the khler potential ( that lead to non - holomorphic higgs - fermion couplings at tree level ) are required .",
    "recent results from lhcb on the time - dependent cp asymmetries in @xmath2 and @xmath3 significantly restrict the allowed values for the @xmath0 mixing phase . combining these results with measurements of cdf and d0 of the time - dependent cp asymmetry in @xmath2 as well as the measurements of the time - dependent cp asymmetry in @xmath29 at the b factories ,",
    "we find the following 2@xmath43 ranges for possible np phases in @xmath0 and @xmath1 mixing : @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "the preference for a negative np phase in @xmath1 mixing is driven by tensions in fits of the unitarity triangle , while the np phase in @xmath0 mixing is perfectly consistent with 0 . under the assumptions that neither the absorptive part of the @xmath0 mixing amplitude nor the sm tree - level @xmath2 decay amplitude are significantly affected by np , the anomalous like sign dimuon charge asymmetry observed by d0",
    "can not be explained given the above bounds . and",
    "@xmath3 and the d0 measurement of the like sign dimuon charge asymmetry with np effects in @xmath171 has been analyzed very recently in @xcite . ]    in view of these results we studied the possible impact of higher dimensional operators in the mssm on b physics .",
    "we considered dimension 5 operators both in the superpotential and in the khler potential assuming that they are generated at a scale of @xmath172  tev .",
    "the 1/m suppressed operators in the superpotential have important impact on the higgs spectrum .",
    "they can significantly enhance the tree level mass of the lightest higgs boson and lead to a mass splitting between the two heavy neutral higgs bosons . with complex coefficients",
    "they also lead to scalar - pseudoscalar mixing .",
    "the 1/m operators in the khler potential can induce non - holomorphic higgs couplings and consequently flavor changing neutral higgs couplings at the tree level .",
    "assuming that the khler potential operators follow the minimal flavor violation ansatz , we find a flavor phenomenology that resembles to a large extent the 2 higgs doublet model with mfv discussed in  @xcite .",
    "in particular large values for @xmath66 are not required to generate sizable corrections to b meson mixing from neutral higgs exchange and therefore the strong constraint from br@xmath12 can be significantly relaxed .",
    "we find that both superpotential and khler potential operators are required to generate non - standard effects in the @xmath1 mixing phase that are in agreement with the current bounds on the @xmath0 mixing phase from lhcb .",
    "the corresponding region of parameter space is characterized by rather small values of @xmath173 as well as low masses for the heavy higgs bosons @xmath174  gev .",
    "we stress that in the class of models discussed in this work , a non - standard @xmath1 mixing phase does imply also non - standard effects in the @xmath0 mixing phase at a level that can be tested in the near future by lhcb .",

    "here we briefly present uv completions that lead to the higher dimensional operators in  ( [ eq : super ] ) and ( [ eq : kahler ] ) .",
    "the dimension 5 superpotential operator in  ( [ eq : super ] ) can be generated by integrating out a heavy singlet s with the following superpotential interactions  @xcite @xmath175 additional gauge interactions that are broken at a high scale @xmath176 can be effectively described by dimension 6 operators  @xcite .    one way to generate the khler potential operators in  ( [ eq : kahler ] ) is to introduce two heavy @xmath177 doublets @xmath178 , @xmath179 with hypercharge @xmath180 and @xmath181 that couple to fermions and mix with the mssm higgs doublets @xmath182 , @xmath183  @xcite .",
    "neglecting for simplicity gauge interactions , their khler potential and superpotential read @xmath184 integrating out the heavy higgs doublets generates the supersymmetric term in  ( [ eq : kahler ] ) and susy breaking can be incorporated with the auxiliary spurion @xmath73 .",
    "in addition to  ( [ eq : kahler ] ) , integrating out the heavy higgses from  ( [ eq : uv ] ) also generates @xmath69 suppressed terms in the superpotential @xmath185 that in turn generate dimension 5 fermion  sfermion interactions .",
