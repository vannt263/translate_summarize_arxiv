    "according to these models galaxies grow through star formation and at first host  small \" bh possibly in very dense and obscured nuclear environments . as time progresses the combined radiative and mechanical output from star formation and the bh accretion grows too , until the agn reaches qso luminosities and literally blows away the circumnuclear material .",
    "this effectively terminates star formation and the smbh shines briefly ( in cosmic terms ) as an unobscured qso .",
    "once it has accreted the remaining material , the qso switches off , leaving a passively evolving galaxy with a  dormant \" smbh , such as those observed in present - day massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "the far - infrared ( fir)-submillimetric ( submm ) spectral region is ideally suited for searching for star formation , since the black - body - like ( greybody ) emission by cold dust associated with star formation peaks at those wavelengths . at the same time it suffers very modest",
    "obscuration from the circumnuclear material .",
    "this is proved by the large numbers of strongly star forming submm galaxies ( smgs ) detected by scuba , aztec , sma and , lately , herschel , among other facilities .",
    "there are many multi - wavelength studies of smgs , both from surveys in `` blank fields '' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and targeting overdensities of such sources around high redshift objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these studies probe the properties of the star formation and of the agn , and the association between both phenomena , although there are not many cases in which this association has been proved .",
    "smgs have substantial stellar masses in place by @xmath10 . a relatively high fraction of smgs host agn ( e.g. @xcite , but see @xcite ) , which seem to have bh - to - stellar mass ratios smaller than local galaxies @xcite .",
    "this implies that bh growth lags galaxy growth , since the host galaxies are already mature , while the bhs still require substantial growth ( e.g. , by about a factor of 6 ) , which however can be accommodated within the limits imposed by the lifetime of the submm - bright phase @xcite , if accretion occurs close to the eddington limit @xcite .",
    "the observed population of @xmath10 smgs would be sufficient to account for the formation of the population of bright ellipticals seen in the present universe @xcite .",
    "we have found @xcite a sample of x - ray - obscured qsos at @xmath11 ( when most of the star formation and bh growth is occuring in the universe ) with strong submm emission , much higher than x - ray - unobscured qsos at similar redshifs and luminosities , which however represent 85 - 90% of the x - ray qsos at that epoch .",
    "this submm emission is too high to come from the agn @xcite .",
    "the fields around these objects show strong overdensities of smgs @xcite .",
    "the uv and x - ray spectra of the central qsos @xcite show evidence for strong ionized winds which produce the x - ray obscuration . piecing all these clues together",
    "we infer that the host galaxies of these qsos are undergoing strong sfr , while the central smbh are also growing through accretion .",
    "the ionized winds are strong enough to quench the star formation , so the qsos must be just emerging from a strongly obscured accretion state to become  normal \" unobscured qsos with passively evolving galaxies , in an evolutionary stage which might last about 10 - 15% of the qso lifetime .",
    "they appear to be in the centres of high density peaks of the universe .",
    "in this paper we endeavour to prove the physical association of one of those overdensities to its central qso ( rx  j094144.51 + 385434.8 , henceforth rx  j0941 ) .",
    "we also investigate the nature and evolutionary stage of those smgs through their rest frame uv - fir seds .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section [ data ] we summarize the data used in this paper and the reduction process , in section [ zphot ] we describe how the source catalogues in each band have been merged into a single catalogue , and how that catalogue has been used to obtain photometric redshifts .",
    "these are then used in section [ results ] to show which objects are associated with the structure around the qso and to the submm sources , and how we have obtained the different physical parameters for each object .",
    "the evolutionary stage of our sources is discussed in section [ discussion ] .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusions ] we summarize our results .",
