    "the tensor renormalization - group ( trg ) method , recently introduced by levin and nave @xcite is versatile , accurate , and conceptually interesting .",
    "the versatility of trg comes from being a genuinely local renormalization - group transformation , that is a mapping between local hamiltonians on the original and coarse - grained lattices , expressed in terms of tensors at sites of each lattice .",
    "thus , although trg has been demonstrated by obtaining very accurate phase transition temperatures and magnetization curves for frustrated and unfrustrated classical ising models on the triangular lattice , we believe that it can be extended to yield the critical properties and entire thermodynamics of complicated multicritical systems , including quenched random systems , by renormalization - group flow analysis .    in the present work , we show that the renormalization - group flows of the tensor elements can be analyzed in the same manner as the flows of hamiltonian interaction parameters , which was not done in the previous work .",
    "each thermodynamic phase region corresponds to a basin of attraction in the space of tensor elements , and critical temperatures and exponents ( not obtained before ) are deduced from characteristics of the boundaries between the different basins .",
    "practically , this means that the phase diagram , thermodynamic , and critical properties of the infinite system can be derived directly from the flows .",
    "moreover , the flows themselves have an interesting and unconventional nature , since a phase region does not flow to single isolated sink , but rather to a continuous surface of fixed points . using the ferromagnetic triangular lattice ising model as an example , we show that the accuracy of the calculated free energy , critical temperature , and thermal critical exponent can be easily and systematically improved on by increasing @xmath1 , the cutoff on the index range of the tensors . in this ability to converge toward exact values with larger cutoffs ,",
    "trg is more general and dependable than position - space renormalization - group techniques @xcite whose successes have been based on system - specific heuristics @xcite . the trg approach combines the straightforward interpretative framework of traditional renormalization group  analysis of flows in a parameter space  with the accuracy of techniques depending on finite - size scaling of large systems .",
    "the trg method @xcite can be applied to any classical lattice hamiltonian satisfying the following conditions : ( 1 ) it can be expressed in terms of degrees of freedom on the bonds of the lattice ; ( 2 ) the boltzmann weight of a configuration can be written as the product of individual boltzmann weights for each lattice site , that only depend on the bond variables adjoining the site .",
    "this is a broad category including many common statistical physics systems like the ising and potts models , both of which can be mapped onto this form through duality transformations , as well as all vertex models . for such hamiltonians",
    ", the partition function can be written as a _ tensor network _",
    "@xcite : we start with a lattice of @xmath3 sites where each site has coordination number @xmath4 and each bond is in one of @xmath5 possible states .",
    "the boltzmann weight of an individual site depends on the configuration of the @xmath4 bonds meeting at the site and can be written as a tensor @xmath6 , where each index @xmath7 runs from 1 to @xmath5 . for configurations of bond variables that are not allowed ,",
    "the corresponding element of @xmath8 is zero .",
    "the tensor is real - valued and cyclically symmetric .",
    "the transformation described below works also for the more general case of complex - valued , cyclically symmetric tensors , onto which our original tensor network system is mapped after a single renormalization step .",
    "the partition function is a product over the @xmath3 site tensors , with each index contracted between two different tensors ( since each bond is shared between two sites ) , @xmath9    the position - space renormalization - group transformation of this system allows us to express the partition function equivalently as a tensor network over a coarse - grained lattice with @xmath10 vertices , in two spatial dimensions , with a length rescaling factor @xmath11 .",
    "it is accomplished in two steps , which we call rewiring and decimation . for simplicity",
    ", we shall focus in this work on applying the transformation to the hexagonal lattice , though this two - step procedure can easily be adapted to a variety of two - dimensional lattices , including the square  @xcite and kagome lattices .        _ rewiring : _ graphically , let us represent the tensor @xmath12 at each point of the hexagonal lattice as a three - legged vertex as shown on the left of fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , and a contraction of an index between two tensors as a connection between two vertex legs .",
    "we use the convention that the order of indices in the tensor matches the counterclockwise ordering of the labels on the vertex legs . the rewiring step for a pair of neighboring tensors",
    "consists of reconnecting the bonds in the manner of fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , rewriting them as a contraction of two new tensors @xmath13 , @xmath14 the first two indices in the tensor @xmath15 run up to @xmath5 , but the third index @xmath16 runs up to @xmath17 . we shall distinguish these types of indices by a greek letter label , and graphically depict them as thick legs [ fig . [ fig1](a ) center ] . to see that such a rewiring is possible ,",
    "let us introduce composite indices @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and write the tensor contraction on the left - hand side of eq . as a @xmath20 matrix @xmath21 .",
    "then eq . becomes @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "we can find @xmath13 using the fact that @xmath24 , as can be checked using the cyclical symmetry of the @xmath8 tensors .",
    "any symmetric matrix @xmath25 admits a variant of singular value decomposition known as takagi factorization  @xcite : @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a @xmath28 unitary square matrix and @xmath29 is a @xmath28 diagonal matrix containing the singular values of @xmath25 . if @xmath30 is the @xmath16th singular value ( assumed ordered from largest to smallest with increasing @xmath16 ) ,",
    "then the elements of @xmath13 are given by @xmath31 .",
    "the resulting decomposition @xmath32 is not unique , because we can replace @xmath13 by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a complex orthogonal matrix ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "however , we shall always use the @xmath13 given directly by the the takagi factorization , so if the @xmath16th singular value @xmath30 is nondegenerate , the @xmath16th column of @xmath13 is uniquely determined up to a factor of @xmath36 .",
    "the rewiring procedure described above is applied globally to the entire hexagonal lattice as shown by the first arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) , grouping the @xmath8 tensors into pairs , and replacing each pair by @xmath13 tensors .    _ decimation : _ the second step in the renormalization procedure consists of tracing over the degrees of freedom in the triangular clusters that are formed after the rewiring . as illustrated in fig",
    ". [ fig1](c ) , each such cluster can be replaced by a single renormalized tensor @xmath37 , @xmath38 introducing the notation @xmath39 for the @xmath40 matrix with elements @xmath41 at fixed @xmath42 , then the above equation has the form @xmath43 = t^\\prime_{\\gamma\\delta\\nu}\\,.\\ ] ] it is clear from eq . that the renormalized tensor will be cyclically symmetric",
    "since the @xmath13 tensor is constructed from the unitary matrix @xmath27 , the elements of @xmath37 will in general be complex .",
    "the second arrow of fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) shows the decimation applied to every triangular cluster , and the result is a hexagonal lattice of @xmath37 tensors with the lattice spacing larger by a factor of @xmath44 compared to the original hexagonal lattice .",
    "the renormalization - group transformation described so far is an exact mapping of one tensor network onto another , preserving the partition function @xmath45 .",
    "however , the renormalized tensors have a more complicated structure than the original ones , since the indices of @xmath46 run up to @xmath17 .",
    "if this procedure is repeated , the index range grows exponentially with iteration number , making numerical implementation impractical .",
    "this is analogous to the difficulty encountered when applying naive position - space renormalization to hamiltonians on lattices , where the number of couplings in the hamiltonian grows with each iteration .",
    "some kind of approximate truncation is required to keep the complexity of the renormalized model bounded . in our case this truncation can be done in a straightforward and systematic fashion by setting an upper bound @xmath1 for the index range .",
    "rather than use the full @xmath28 matrix @xmath47 to calculate @xmath37 , we use only the first @xmath48 columns , where @xmath49 . using this truncated @xmath50 matrix , which we call @xmath51 ,",
    "means that the rewiring step is implemented only approximately , @xmath52 .",
    "however , this is the best approximation possible , since the first @xmath48 columns of @xmath13 correspond to the @xmath48 largest singular values of @xmath25 . the decimation step of eq .",
    "is still carried out exactly , but with @xmath13 replaced by @xmath51 .",
    "the resulting tensor @xmath46 has indices that run up to @xmath48 .",
    "in order to illustrate the nature of the renormalization - group flows resulting from the transformation outlined above and the methods by which thermodynamic information can be extracted from them , we turn now to a specific example : the triangular lattice ferromagnetic ising model . this model is mapped onto a tensor network through a duality transformation , giving an equivalent partition function in terms of bond variables on a hexagonal lattice.@xcite each bond in this dual lattice has two states , @xmath53 or @xmath54 , corresponding to a bond between parallel or antiparallel ising spins . these states respectively contribute energies @xmath55 and @xmath56 to the total hamiltonian @xmath57 .",
    "the tensor for each lattice site has the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 , and the factor multiplying the exponential is a projection operator that is equal to @xmath60 for allowed configurations of the bonds and @xmath61 otherwise . for simplicity we set @xmath62 , effectively measuring temperatures in units of @xmath63 . if the triangular lattice has @xmath3 sites , the dual hexagonal lattice has @xmath64 sites , and the partition function is a contraction of the @xmath64 site tensors .",
    "iterating the renormalization - group transformation , we consider renormalization - group flows in the space of tensor element amplitudes @xmath65 .",
    "for a cyclically symmetric tensor @xmath12 with index range @xmath5 , the maximum number of distinct elements is @xmath66 .",
    "after the first few iterations , the index range of the renormalized tensors reaches the cutoff @xmath1 and remains there , so that the flows in the subsequent steps are in a space with dimension @xmath67 . in this work",
    "we look at cutoffs in the range @xmath68 to @xmath69 , so the most complex flow space that we investigate is 4624-dimensional .",
    "a large number of the @xmath67 tensor elements are zero , corresponding to disallowed bond configurations , typically making up between 50 - 55% of the total in the later steps .",
    "the locations of the zero elements usually stay the same for a few steps at a time , but can shift abruptly during the flow . to minimize roundoff errors which can affect the results at later iterations , the singular value decomposition and matrix manipulations involved in trg",
    "are all implemented at quadruple precision , using a customized version of the lapack library  @xcite .    due to the contraction during the decimation step ,",
    "the tensor elements tend to increase in magnitude rapidly with each iteration , which can lead to numerical problems .",
    "these are avoided similarly to the procedure used in global strong - coupling flows in position - space renormalization - group theory .",
    "the physics described by the tensor network is unaffected by an overall constant multiplying each element in the tensor .",
    "thus at each step we factor out the absolute value of a nonzero element , for example @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath71 element is a convenient choice , since it remains nonzero throughout the renormalization - group flow .",
    "the renormalization - group transformation is then applied to the reduced tensor @xmath72 , giving a renormalized tensor @xmath37 .",
    "let us denote @xmath8 as @xmath73 and @xmath37 as @xmath74 .",
    "the factorization and renormalization - group transformation are iterated , so at the @xmath75th step we have a tensor @xmath76 . as we shall see below , with this added factorization step the elements of @xmath77 tend to finite limiting values as @xmath78 .",
    "additionally , keeping track of the factors @xmath79 during the flow , as in standard position - space renormalization - group theory , allows us to easily determine the free energy of the system in the thermodynamic limit.@xcite defining @xmath80 , the partition function is a contraction of @xmath64 tensors @xmath73 , which we write schematically as @xmath81 . after a single renormalization - group step ,",
    "this becomes @xmath82 .",
    "thus after @xmath75 steps we find @xmath83 the free energy per original site @xmath84 is then @xmath85 as @xmath86 the elements of @xmath87 go to finite fixed values , and thus for large @xmath3 the second term on the right in eq .",
    "becomes negligible .",
    "so the final result for the free energy is @xmath88 . in practice",

    "these fixed values change continuously as @xmath123 is varied , as they map out a slice of the two fixed surfaces corresponding to the low- and high - temperature phases .",

    "in the case of @xmath104 , @xmath130 . for small perturbations away from the critical fixed point , the number and locations of these nonzero elements stay the same after a renormalization - group transformation , which allows us to numerically evaluate the @xmath131 recursion matrix @xmath132 . writing the eigenvalues of @xmath133 in the form @xmath134 , @xmath135",

    "in summary , we have seen that the flows of the tensor elements in the trg transformation can be used to extract the phase diagram structure and critical behavior of a classical two - dimensional lattice hamiltonian . for the triangular lattice ising model ,",
    "the low- and high - temperature phase regions are basins of attraction for two distinct surfaces of fixed points .",
    "the boundary between these basins defines a critical temperature @xmath99 , dependent on the trg cutoff @xmath1 . at small cutoffs such as @xmath68 and 8 ,",
    "the flows near the boundary between the basins are controlled by a critical fixed point , while at higher @xmath1 the flows show more complicated behavior , never converging at a unique point . in",
    "the former case the thermal exponent @xmath137 is found from the eigenvalues of the recursion matrix at the critical fixed point , while in the latter we can deduce the exponent from the scaling of the calculated specific heat near @xmath99 .",
    "the free energy at all temperatures systematically converges to the exact ising result with increasing @xmath1 , particularly fast away from the critical region . for",
    "the critical properties the improvement is not monotonic in @xmath1 , but both the critical temperature @xmath99 and the exponent @xmath137 tend toward the exact ising values at larger cutoffs .",
    "with very modest computational effort , the trg method provides an accurate portrait of global phase diagram characteristics .",
