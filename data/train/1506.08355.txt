    "the colour scale shows the intensity of emission at different energies and different moments of time .",
    "one can see that the amplification of the flux from the part of the disk which is exactly behind the caustic leads to the appearance of an increased flux between some minimal and maximal energy .",

    "the shape of the curve which the red and blue edge draw in the middle panel of fig .  [ fig : profile_a01_view80 ] depends on two parameters : the rotation moment of the black hole @xmath66 and the inclination angle of the disk @xmath67 .",

    ", these red / blue edge time evolution curves could be called the `` microlensing portraits '' of the broad emission lines .",
    "the independence of the shape of the microlensing portrait of the line on the system parameters could be understood in simple terms if one uses a toy model of the accretion disk based on the newtonian gravity instead of the gr ( or an alternative theory of gravity ) .",

    "the circular orbits in newtonian gravity have velocities @xmath68 the maximal doppler red / blue shift of line emission produced at the distance @xmath19 occurs for the emission produced at the line of nodes of the disk .",
    "it is determined by the inclination angle @xmath67 of the disk @xmath69 the microlensing caustic is a line inclined at an angle @xmath70 with respect to the line of nodes of the disk .",
    "if the caustic moves with the projected velocity @xmath71 , the motion of the intersection of the caustic with the line of nodes is described by the relation @xmath72 so that the time evolution of the maximal / minimal blue / red shift is @xmath73 the functional shape of @xmath74 is @xmath75 and it does not depend on the parameters of the system .",
    "in fact , in non - relativistic theory the functional shape of the curve is determined by the gravity theory itself , rather than by the parameters of the system .",
    "if the gravity force law would deviate from the @xmath76 , the functional shape of the @xmath74 curve would deviate from @xmath75 .",
    "variations of parameters of the system do not change the shape of the curve , but instead they influence the scaling of the @xmath65 and @xmath64 axis in the `` microlensing portrait '' of the curve .",
    "for example , changing the velocity of motion of the caustic would lead to stretching or squeezing of the time scale of the caustic crossing , i.e. the scale of the @xmath65 axis . a similar effect occurs if the angle @xmath70 changes .",
    "only the projected velocity of the caustic , @xmath77 , matters .",

    "in addition to the doppler effect given by the doppler factor @xmath83 , the line emission is gravitationally redshifted .",
    "the functional shapes of both the gravitational redshift and of the keplerian velocity depend on the black hole rotation momentum @xmath66 .",
    "one more important difference between non - relativistic and relativistic gravity model is that in non - relativistic gravity the function @xmath74 is not bounded from above and from below .",
    "this is because the circular orbits can be arbitrarily close to the centre of gravity .",
    "to the contrary , in gr the stable circular orbits exist only down to the distance of the isco .",
    "finite gravitational and doppler red / blue shifts of photons emitted from the isco explain the `` plateau '' parts of the `` microlensing portraits '' of the line shown in fig .",

    "note that in spite of the fact that the overall evolution of the form of the spectrum of the broad line throughout the caustic crossing period is quite complicated , the evolution of the edge could be determined rather reliably and independently from the details of the complex evolution of the spectrum .",
    "taking into account sharpness of the edge , one could use the dedicated imaging analysis methods ( e.g. wavelet analysis ) to single out the edge evolution on top of the overall spectral evolution .    if the quality of the data is high enough , fitting of the model curves to the data provides a test of the relativistic gravity theory ( if the number of data points in the edge evolution curve is larger than four ) .",
    "if the sensitivity of the telescope is high enough , even more constraints on the gravity theory could be derived from the observation of the edge evolution curves of the higher order images ( see the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : profile_a01_view80 ] ) , because the shape of these curves does not depend on any additional parameters .",
    "depending on the orientation of the accretion disk with respect to the line of sight , the edge evolution curves provide different types of information on the details of the structure of gravitational field and of the motion of massive test bodies and photons in this gravitational field .    if the disk is observed almost face - on ( the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : portrait_perpendicular ] ) , the edge evolution curve has two red branches ( @xmath87 ) and no blue branch .",

    ", one could define the moment when the caustics crosses the centre of the disk image .",
    "if the time is counted with this moment taken as a zero reference time , the shape of the @xmath74 curve provides a measurement of the gravitational redshift as a function of the distance from the black hole .",
    "the `` plateau '' of the edge evolution curve , visible in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : portrait_perpendicular ] , corresponds to the time interval when the caustic passes the isco .",
    "the depth of the plateau is determined by the gravitational redshift of photons emitted almost perpendicularly to the disk from the isco .",

    "obviously , the measurement of the distance ( time ) dependent tilt of the curve provides a measurement of velocities of the circular orbits as a function of the distance .",
    "if the black hole rotation moment @xmath66 is not zero , the inclination of the disk not only `` tilts '' the plateau corresponding to the period of passage of the isco , it also deforms its shape .",
    "this is because of the fact that even in the absence of the doppler effect due to the disk rotation , there is an angular dependence of the gravitational redshift in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eobs ] ) caused by the rotational drag by the black hole .",
    "photons reaching the observer from different points of the isco are emitted in different directions spanning a cone with the axis given by the black hole rotation axis and with an opening angle comparable to the inclination angle of the disk .",
    "evolution of the energy of the red / blue edge of the line during the period of caustic crossing of the isco provides a `` scan '' of the red / blue shift of the photon energy as a function of direction along the cone .",
    "if the quality of the spectral measurements is high enough , the angle between the caustics and the line of nodes of the disk could be measured from an effect of `` splitting '' of the edge during the period of caustic passage of the isco .",
    "the origin of such splitting is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : redshift_image ] .",
    "the red / blue shifts of photons emitted from the points of intersection of the caustic with the isco are different .",
    "if the caustic is perpendicular to the line of nodes , this difference is small and the effect of the splitting of the edge is difficult to observe .",
    "however , if the caustics is strongly inclined , the effect of the splitting by the caustic is more pronounced and could be used for the measurement of the angle @xmath0 .",
    "the results of the previous section show that measurements of the evolution of the red / blue edge of line emission from the accretion disk during the periods of crossing of the disk image by the microlensing caustic provide a unique possibility to make a range of measurements , which could be used to characterise the structure of the strong gravitational field in the direct vicinity of the black hole horizon .",
    "the functional shape of the microlensing portraits of the lines , shown in fig .  [ fig : portrait_perpendicular ] , is largely independent from the parameters of the accretion disk and of the caustic passing in front of the disk image .",
    "this near - parameter - independence indicates that the measurements of the `` microlensing portraits '' of the lines could potentially be used to test the gr in the strong field regime near the black hole horizon .",

    "such strong increase of the flux of one of the source images could be detected via a monitoring campaign of a strongly lensed source with an x - ray telescope with even a moderate angular resolution , which is not able to resolve the multiple images of the source ( like e.g. the swift / xrt instrument ) . from the pattern of the magnification maps in fig .",
    "[ fig : caustics ] one can see that the caustic crossing moment should be preceded by a period of the steep rise of the magnification factor in about 50% of caustics crossing episodes due to the presence of the `` plateau '' regions in the caustic shapes .",
    "identification of such steep flux rises in caustic crossing precursors with a regular monitoring campaign of a lensed source ( year - to - multi - year long ) should pose no problem .",
    "the size of the accretion disk in the visible band is significantly larger than the gravitational radius  ( by one - two orders of magnitude , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the overall changes of magnitudes of the source images due to the microlensing are moderate , because of the large source size . still , the caustic crossing periods should be identifiable as the periods of the rapidly growing amplitude of the difference of the flux of one of the source images .",
    "the best possibility for the caustics crossing detection is , perhaps , a combination of the data of the visible and x - ray band monitoring .",
    "optical monitoring of the source could serve for the confirmation of the approach of the caustic crossing moment , identified based on the detection of the `` x - ray precursor '' .    as soon as the caustic crossing precursor is detected , an intense observational campaign with more powerful x - ray telescopes which are able to resolve the individual source image components could be initiated , with the main goal to obtain a high signal - to - noise ratio `` microlensing portrait '' of the relativistically broadened line , like the one shown in the middle panel of fig .  [ fig : portrait_perpendicular ] .",
    "the quality of the test of gr , which could be obtained via the measurement of the microlensing portrait of the fe  k@xmath0 , line depends on the precision of the measurement of the edge evolution curve .",
    "this precision depends on the number of the observations , carried out throughout the caustic crossing period , and on the precision of the measurement of the edge position in each observation .",
    "minimum five observations per caustic crossing are required to fully determine the parameters of the curve .",
    "each additional data point is potentially useful for the test of the theory .",
    "first constraints on the relativistic gravity theory could be obtained using the proposed method already with the current generation x - ray telescopes ",
    "swift / xrt , xmm - newton , chandra and suzaku .",
    "higher precision of the test can be obtained with the high spectral resolution measurement , e.g. the x - ray spectrometers on astro - h  @xcite and/or athena  @xcite .",

    "<S> we show that observation of the time - dependent effect of microlensing of relativistically broadened emission lines ( such as e.g. the fe k@xmath0 line in x - rays ) in strongly lensed quasars could provide data on celestial mechanics of circular orbits in the direct vicinity of the horizon of supermassive black holes . </S>",
    "<S> this information can be extracted from the observation of evolution of red / blue edge of the magnified line just before and just after the period of crossing of the innermost stable circular orbit by the microlensing caustic . </S>",
    "<S> the functional form of this evolution is insensitive to numerous astrophysical parameters of the accreting black hole and of the microlensing caustics network system ( as opposed to the evolution the full line spectrum ) . </S>",
    "<S> measurement of the temporal evolution of the red / blue edge could provide a precision measurement of the radial dependence of the gravitational redshift and of velocity of the circular orbits , down to the innermost stable circular orbit . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements could be used to discriminate between the general relativity and alternative models of the relativistic gravity in which the dynamics of photons and massive bodies orbiting the gravitating centre is different from that of the geodesics in the schwarzschild or kerr space - times . </S>"
