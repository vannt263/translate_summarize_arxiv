    "our galactic model is a three components ( spheroid , disc , thick disc ) code which closely follows the `` classic '' galactic models by bahcall & soneira ( 1984 , b&s ) and gilmore & reid ( 1983 , see also paper i and references therein ) concerning the spatial density distribution of stars .",
    "however , it relies on suitable assumptions on the evolutionary status and on the initial mass function ( imf ) of the various galactic populations to reproduce the luminosity functions used as an ( observational ) input in paper i. we recall here the main characteristics of the model referring , for a detailed discussion , to castellani et al .",
    "( 2001 , paper ii ) . predicted results are obtained by randomly generating star masses according to the adopted imf ( kroupa 2001 ) and by using stellar models to derive luminosities in the selected bands for each given value of the stellar mass and age .",
    "spheroid stars are assumed to be almost coeval and thus they are reproduced by populating a suitable theoretical isochrone ( age= 12 gyr , z= 0.0002 , y= 0.23 ) , while for both the thick disc and the disc one has to take into account prolonged episodes of star formation .",
    "thus for these two components star masses and ages are both randomly generated , the mass distribution reproducing the selected imf , while a flat age distribution is adopted within the range assumed for each component .",
    "for the disc we chose a constant star formation rate ( sfr ) from 50 myr to 9 gyr to populate evolutionary tracks ( z=0.02 y=0.27 ) until the asymptotic giant branch and the wd cooling sequences .",
    "for the thick disc , following gilmore , wyse , & jones ( 1995 ) and norris ( 1999 ) , we assume a metallicity of @xmath0z=0.006 and a sfr centered at @xmath0 10 gyr with a spread of few gyr .",
    "thanks to this theoretical approach the model spontaneously predicts the occurrence of stars in the various evolutionary phases .",
    "by relying on the above described model one can easily predict the expected abundance of wds , since each star evolved beyond the agb phase and less massive than the lower mass limit for supernovae ( m@xmath1 ) is assumed to be a wd .",
    "however , to predict the colour - magnitude ( cm ) location of these dwarfs one needs further theoretical ingredients , as given by : i ) a wd mass - progenitor mass relation , ii ) theoretical wd models to obtain luminosity and temperature of a wd as a function of mass and age and iii ) suitable color transformations .",
    "as shown in more detail in paper ii , the prediction on the wd population barely changes if we substitute the theoretical cooling tracks by chabrier et al .",
    "( 2000 ) with the ones by salaris et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , both transformed into the observational plane by means of saumon & jacobson ( 1999 ) model atmosphere .",
    "we checked also that the predicted wd magnitude distribution shows small differences changing the semi - empirical wd mass - progenitor mass relation by weidemann ( 2000 ) with the exponential one by wood ( 1992 ) . in the following",
    "we will adopt theoretical cooling tracks by salaris et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and the semi - empirical mass relation by weidemann ( 2000 ) .",
    "the predicted spheroid wd population obviously depends on the assumption on the halo age .",
    "1 shows the predicted luminosity functions at four different ages : 6 , 8 , 10 , 13.5 gyr . as well known , for a given age the bulk of the wd distribution is close but not precisely at the faint end of the cooling isochrone .",
    "the larger is the age the fainter is the bulk of the wd population .",
    "this is a well understood feature : the increase of the time spent in the cooling sequence implies a progressive decrease of wd luminosity .",
    "furthermore the distribution of wd populations significantly depends on the adopted imf .",
    "the number of wds is obviously affected only by imf variations for masses which could evolve into wds in a time shorter than the estimated age of the universe . as range of variation",
    "we assume the uncertainty on the salpeter exponential ( @xmath2 ) , as evaluated by kroupa ( 2001 ; @xmath3 ) .",
    "as expected , a steeper imf ( @xmath2=2.6 ) depopulates the wd stars .",
    "this behaviour can be easily understood as a consequence of the decrease of the number of stars in the mass range able to produce wds .",
    "fig 2 and 3 show the predicted results for a field of 0.5 square degrees at the galactic coordinates l=0 , b=50 .",
    "the small panel in the cm diagram ( cmd ) ( left figure ) show the star counts for a field of about 6.6 arcmin@xmath4 of extension , that is the area generally covered by _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) observations ( see e.g. king et al .",
    "1998 ) . due to the presence of the thick disc population",
    ", the whole sample of stars in the cmd appears rather uniformly spreaded , without the `` double peaked '' feature usually predicted by the two - components models because of the separation in colour between the disc and the spheroid population ( see e.g. b&s , 1984 ) .",
    "an important finding of our prediction is that observations down to @xmath5 include almost the whole disc population and disc wds .",
    "only a few percent of thick disc and spheroid wds are observable to this luminosities ; from fig . 3",
    "one sees that the thick disc wd @xmath6-magnitude distribution appears centered at @xmath7 , while the spheroid distribution is centered at @xmath8 , with a tail reaching faint luminosities down to @xmath9 . from the ( @xmath10)-colour distributions ( fig 2 , right panel )",
    "it appears that the whole wd population takes place at colours bluer then ( @xmath10)@xmath11 .",
    "moreover , at sufficiently blue colours , i.e. ( @xmath10)@xmath12 , and not too high luminosity ( @xmath13 ) , the sample is constituted exclusively by wds .",
    "we described our galactic model able to reproduce star counts and synthetic cmds of field stars from the main sequence to the wd evolutionary phase at the various photometric bands and galactic coordinates .",
    "the main goal is the introduction of disc / thick disc and spheroid wd population in an evolutionary consistent way .",
    "we found that the wd population is barely sensitive to a change of theoretical wd models or to a variation of the adopted relation between the wd mass and the progenitor mass .",
