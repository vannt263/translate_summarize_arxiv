    "the doublet - triplet splitting problem is one of the most serious problems in supersymmetric ( susy ) grand unified theories ( gut )  @xcite . in susy - gut ,",
    "the weak - doublet higgs fields which are responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking belong to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 representations of su(5 ) .",
    "they are composed of , in addition to the weak doublet , the color - triplet under the gauge group of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "after the su(5 ) symmetry breaking , the weak doublets would still be massless while the color - triplets have to be decoupled from physics below the gut scale , @xmath2 , otherwise they may induce the proton decay in an experimentally unacceptable level through the yukawa interactions to quarks or leptons in the sm .",
    "most attempts to the doublet - triplet problem in the literatures have been focused on how to naturally explain the hierarchy between the weak doublet and the color - triplet higgs boson masses after the gut symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to the doublet - triplet splitting problem , instead of requiring the triplet to have a mass of gut scale , is to suppress the yukawa couplings of the color - triplet higgs fields to the sm quarks or leptons in order to preserve the proton longevity .",
    "thus , no mass splitting between the weak - doublet and color - triplet higgs fields is required .",
    "the natural scale of the color - triplet higgs mass in this approach is the electroweak scale , say @xmath3 .",
    "suppression of the yukawa couplings of the triplet is possible via the following mechanisms .    *",
    "the sm fermion masses are generated from a higher dimensional operators involving the gut higgs field in the adjoint representation , the vev of which can be arranged such that the yukawa couplings of the doublets get the usual values while the yukawa couplings of the triplets are zero  @xcite . *",
    "the overlap of the wave - functions of the color - triplet higgs fields with the sm fermions in extra dimensions are sufficiently small  @xcite . *",
    "another type of models is based on orbifolding in ads space . by assigning different spatial parities to various components of the higgs multiplet ,",
    "the wave - function of the color - triplet higgs fields are zero at the planck brane , on which the matter fermions reside @xcite .",
    "thus , the excessive proton decay via the the colored higgs boson is highly suppressed .",
    "in addition , the mass of the color - triplet fields is given by the warp factor of the ads and naturally of a tev scale .",
    "we shall describe these models in some details in the next section .",
    "the generic feature of these models to the doublet - triplet problem is the presence of colored higgs bosons in tev scale .",
    "in fact , this is an alternative novel signature to the conventional signature of proton decay , and can be tested in the upcoming lhc .",
    "it is then worthwhile to investigate the phenomenology of the tev colored higgs bosons in collider experiments at high energy frontier . in hadronic collisions ,",
    "the colored higgs bosons are produced via the glue - glue fusion and the @xmath4-channel @xmath5 annihilation .",
    "on the other hand , it is also possible to produce pairs of colored higgs bosons at tev @xmath6 linear colliders and @xmath7 colliders via the u(1)@xmath8 gauge boson exchange , but the production rates are suppressed relative to hadronic production because of the small u(1)@xmath8 coupling . in this paper , we calculate the production and describe the detection of the tev colored higgs bosons in hadron colliders .",
    "as we already mentioned , the colored higgs bosons do not have sizable yukawa couplings to the sm fermions in order to suppress the fast proton decay .",
    "thus , the only allowed production channels of the colored higgs bosons in hadronic collisions are via the su(3)@xmath9 invariant interactions .",
    "the colored higgs bosons have a distinctive feature that gives rise to a novel signature like a `` heavy muon '' .",
    "since they have no yukawa couplings and can only pair - wise couple to gluons , the colored higgs bosons can not decay into the sm particles directly .",
    "they may be able to decay into a gluino and a colored higgsino through the gaugino - matter interactions only if it is kinematically allowed , though .",
    "however , in our analysis , we assume that the colored higgs boson has a mass less than the sum of gluino and colored higgsino masses so that such a decay channel is forbidden .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption because we expect the colored higgsino to have a mass scale as heavy as the colored higgs boson .",
    "therefore , the colored higgs bosons produced in hadron colliders are stable , and will be hadronized into color - neutral massive particles by combining with gluons or light quarks .",
    "statistically , we also assume that half of the time the colored higgs boson will be an electrically - charged particle after hadronization .. ] this is the reason why it will behave like a `` heavy muon '' in the detector .",
    "the novel signature will then be an observable charged track in the central tracking chamber and/or the silicon vertex detector and a penetration to the outer muon chamber ",
    "heavy muon .",
    "taking into account of all these properties , we study the discovery potential of the colored higgs bosons in the upcoming hadron colliders , the lhc and the vlhc .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we briefly describe the three models mentioned above that allow light color - triplet higgs fields . in sec .",
    "iii , we review the interactions of colored higgs bosons and briefly discuss the indirect constraints . in sec .  [",
    "sec : detection ] , we discuss the conditions to detect the colored higgs bosons .",
    "the hadronic production of the colored higgs bosons and their detectability in collider experiments will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : production ] .",
    "the last section will be devoted to a summary and discussion .",
    "in this section , we highlight on three models that allow light ( tev ) color - triplet higgs bosons by dvali @xcite , by haba and maru @xcite , and by goldberger , nomura and smith @xcite .    in supersymmetric gut models , the higgs doublets that give yukawa couplings to fermions are accompanied by the color - triplet in the same multiplet .",
    "the color - triplet couples to fermions with the same yukawa couplings as the doublet before the gut symmetry is broken . that is why the color - triplet has to be extremely heavy in order to avoid the proton decay",
    "however , the proton decay problem can also be solved if the yukawa couplings of the color - triplet are suppressed relative to the doublet by a ratio @xmath10 , and thus the color - triplet needs not to be heavy and can be as light as the doublet .",
    "imposing a specific discrete symmetry to forbid the lowest order yukawa term @xmath11 , the yukawa couplings of the doublet have to be generated via higher dimensional terms .",
    "dvali @xcite constructed a higher dimensional so(10 ) invariant operator @xmath12 where @xmath13 , the matter fermions reside in the @xmath14 , @xmath15 are family indices , @xmath16 consists of color - triplets ( @xmath17 ) and doublets ( @xmath18 ) , and @xmath19 is the gut higgs in the adjoint representation of so(10 ) .",
    "this term can arise from tree - level exchanges of heavier states at @xmath20 .",
    "taking a vev for the @xmath19 as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the @xmath24 antisymmetric matrix , and substituting into the above operator , it is easy to see that the doublet gets a yukawa coupling @xmath25 while the color - triplet has zero yukawa couplings . in this case , the color - triplet would not cause any proton decay and thus can be as light as the doublet .",
    "of course , the usual @xmath26 yukawa term is absent because of a specific discrete symmetry .",
    "dvali was using a @xmath27 @xcite .    another interesting solution to the doublet - triplet problem",
    "was recently proposed by haba and maru @xcite .",
    "although it is of similar spirit , the setup is however entirely different .",
    "basically , in the setup of extra dimensions the proton stability is maintained by suppressing the yukawa couplings of the color - triplet to matter fermions through the small overlap of wave - functions in the extra dimensions .",
    "they started with a su(5 ) model in 5 dimensions with the higgs doublets and triplets in @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the usual su(5 ) gut adjoint higgs field being assumed to localize on the brane at @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is the coordinate in the extra dimension ) , and a pair of bulk fields in @xmath32 . through interactions with the bulk fields ( very similar to the idea of domain - wall fermions ) , the zeroth mode of the higgs doublets are localized in a position close to the brane at @xmath30 , where the matter fermions are confined , while the color - triplet higgs fields are localized at a further distance from the brane at @xmath30 . by varying the distance between the doublets and triplets , the yukawa couplings of the triplets can be sufficiently suppressed to avoid the proton decay while the doublets can generate the usual yukawa couplings to the matter fermions .",
    "therefore , the color - triplets need not be heavy and can be as light as the weak doublets .",
    "the third type of models is based on orbifolding . by assignment of different spatial parities ( or boundary conditions ) to various components of a multiplet , the component fields can have very different properties at the fixed points .",
    "thus , it is possible to break a symmetry or to achieve the doublet - triplet splitting by the boundary conditions . in the model by goldberger et al .",
    "@xcite , they started from the randall - sundrum scenario @xcite : a slice of ads space with two branes ( the planck brane and the tev brane ) at both ends .",
    "the extra dimension is compactified on an @xmath33 orbifold .",
    "the hierarchy of scales is generated by the ads warp factor @xmath34 , which is of order of the five - dimensional planck scale @xmath35 , such that the 4d planck scale is given by @xmath36 .",
    "the fundamental scale on the planck brane is @xmath37 while the fundamental scale on the tev brane is rescaled to tev by the warp factor : @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the size of the extra dimension .",
    "the model is a 5d supersymmetric su(5 ) gauge theory compactified on the orbifold @xmath33 in the ads space .",
    "the boundary conditions break the su(5 ) symmetry and provide a natural mechanism for the higgs doublet - triplet splitting and suppress the proton decay .",
    "the planck brane respects the sm gauge symmetry while the tev brane respects the su(5 ) symmetry .",
    "the matter fermions reside on the planck brane . by the boundary conditions the wave - function of the color - triplet higgs fields are automatically zero at the planck brane , on which the matter fermions reside , while the doublet higgs fields are nonzero at the planck brane and give yukawa couplings to the matter fermions .",
    "thus , the excessive proton decay via the color - triplet higgs fields is highly suppressed , and the doublet - triplet splitting is therefore natural by the boundary conditions .",
    "the mass of the color - triplet fields ( and the xy guage bosons ) is given by the warp factor and is of a tev scale , the same as the kk states of other fields in the setup .",
    "this model is very similar , in spirit , to the second model in suppressing the proton decay by a very small or zero overlap of the wave - functions , but the mechanism is more natural in this model . in addition ,",
    "the mass of the color - triplet is also naturally given by the warp factor in the tev scale .",
    "the two higgs fields in the susy - gut , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , are composed of the weak doublet and the color triplet as follows : @xmath42 where the weak doublets @xmath43 and @xmath44 are responsible for the up- and the down - type quark ( lepton ) masses , respectively . the color - triplets @xmath45 and @xmath46 could be as light as @xmath47 via the mechanisms that we have described above .",
    "the price for the tev colored higgs bosons is the absence of the yukawa interactions of @xmath45 and @xmath46 to the sm fermions .",
    "the colored higgs boson couples to the gluon @xmath48 through the following interactions : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the generator of su(3 ) , and @xmath51 .",
    "the interactions for @xmath46 is the same as @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ int ] ) .",

    "is there any indirect constraints on the colored higgs bosons from the high - energy experiments ?",
    "let us consider the @xmath55-pole experiments at lep1 and slc where the radiative corrections to the gauge boson propagators and the @xmath56 ( @xmath57 denotes quarks or leptons ) vertices are severely constrained .",
    "the contributions to the gauge boson propagators are summarized by the @xmath58 parameters  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the su(2)@xmath59 singlet scalars do not contribute to the @xmath58 parameters  @xcite such that the colored higgs boson is free from the constraints .",
    "since the yukawa interactions of @xmath45 and @xmath46 to the quarks and leptons are highly suppressed , they do not contribute to the @xmath60 processes . by the same reason",
    ", there is no constraint on the colored higgs bosons from flavor physics experiments .",
    "we , therefore , conclude that no indirect constraints are implied for the colored higgs mass from current experiments .",
    "we comment on the gauge coupling unification before closing this section .",
    "it is well known that the success of gauge coupling unification in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) could be preserved if complete multiplets of su(5 ) ( e.g. , @xmath0 or @xmath61 ) are added to the spectrum of mssm .",
    "when @xmath45 and @xmath46 are in tev scale , there must be a vector pair of weak doublets in the same scale to form the @xmath0 and @xmath1 multiplets so that the gauge coupling unification is unaltered .",
    "the origin of the weak vector - like pair is discussed in both refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the colored higgs boson will hadronize into a massive stable particle , which is electrically either neutral or charged .",
    "both the neutral and charged particles will undergo hadronic interactions with detector materials while the charged particle will also undergo ionization , through which the particle loses its kinetic energy ( k.e . ) .",
    "such a massive stable particle will have a high transverse momentum and a small velocity ( or @xmath62 ) .",
    "furthermore , if it is charged it will penetrate detector materials like a muon .",
    "first , we discuss the hadronic energy loss of a massive stable particle in the detector ( both neutral and charged should have similar behavior . )",
    "although it is strongly interacting , it penetrates the material with a very small loss of energy .",
    "this is because the energy loss in hadronic elastic scattering is negligible because of the small momentum transfer .",
    "in addition , the energy loss in elastic or inelastic scattering with nucleons is also small because of the huge mass difference between the massive particle ( tev ) and the nucleon .",
    "thus , the energy loss via hadronic collisions does not lead to detection of the massive particle .",
    "if the colored higgs hadronizes into a neutral particle , it will escape the detector and undetected .",
    "the detection of colored higgs bosons has to rely upon the charged state , which will be described next .",
    "the energy loss @xmath63 due to ionization with the detector material is very standard @xcite .",
    "essentially , the penetrating particle loses energy by exciting the electrons of the material .",
    "the basic formula can be found in eq . ( 26.1 ) in particle data book ( pdb ) @xcite .",
    "we shall ignore the small correction from the density effect .",
    "ionization energy loss @xmath63 is a function of @xmath64 and the charge @xmath65 of the penetrating particle .",
    "the dependence on the mass @xmath66 of the penetrating particle comes in through @xmath67 for a large mass @xmath66 and small @xmath68 @xcite . in other words",

    "therefore , when @xmath63 is measured in an experiment , the @xmath67 can be deduced , which then gives the mass of the particle if the momentum @xmath71 is also measured .",

    "the cdf analyses require that the particle produces a track in the central tracking chamber and/or the silicon vertex detector , and at the same time penetrates to the outer muon chamber .",
    "the cdf detector has a central tracking chamber and a silicon vertex detector ( the central tracking chamber has a slightly better resolution in this regard ) , which can measure the energy loss ( @xmath63 ) of a particle via ionization , especially at low @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) where @xmath78 .",
    "once the @xmath63 is measured , the mass @xmath66 of the particle can be determined if the momentum @xmath71 is measured simultaneously .",
    "furthermore , the particle is required to penetrate through the detector material and make it to the outer muon chamber , provided that it has an initial @xmath79 depending on the mass of the particle @xcite .",

    "the novel signature of these tev colored higgs bosons would be like massive stable charged particles , `` heavy muons '' , producing a track in the central tracking chamber and penetrating to the outer muon system .",
    "such a signature is background free and the momentum can be measured , which enables determination of the mass of the particle via the ionization - energy loss spectrum .",
    "we have demonstrated in details that we employed a reasonably conservative requirement on @xmath89 cut on the massive charged particle such that it can penetrate to the outer muon system and produce a charged track in the central tracking chamber .",
    "we have calculated the production cross sections and the number of signal events of the colored higgs bosons .",
    "we have taken into account the fact that only half of the colored higgs bosons would hadronize into charged particles and an efficiency of 80% to detect a track .",
    "the number of observable events is increased by relaxing the requirement to seeing both colored higgs bosons to seeing at least one .",
    "the tevatron run iib may be able to discover a colored higgs boson up to about 400 gev if an order of 10 events is required for discovery .",
    "the lhc with an accumulated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath127 is sensitive to about 1.5 tev .",
    "the vlhc running at 50 and 200 tev is sensitive up to 3.5 and 9 tev , respectively .",
    "a few more comments are in order .    * in this work , we have assumed that the colored higgs bosons are stable .",
    "an alternative is that the colored higgs boson decays into a gluino and a colored higgsino if kinematically allowed .",
    "the colored higgsino is the supersymmetric partner of the colored higgs boson",
    ". this decay would also be phenomenologically interesting because the colored higgsino would be likely to hadronize into a massive stable charged particle because there are no other lighter particles that it can decay to , and the gluino would decay into quarks and squarks producing jets and missing energies .",
    "* since the colored higgs bosons are stable over cosmological time scale , they have a relic density since the early universe .",
    "our preliminary estimate of the relic density of @xmath45 is of order of @xmath128 for @xmath129 tev @xcite , which is an interesting fraction of the observed cold dark matter density @xmath130 at 95 % c.l . @xcite .",
