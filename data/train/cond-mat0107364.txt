    "random  matrix theory ( rmt ) was introduced by wigner  @xcite to describe the complexity of the spectra and wave functions of atomic nuclei .",
    "it was soon realized that rmt could be applied successfully to a large variety of systems  @xcite .",
    "examples include atoms , molecules , atomic nuclei and quantum dots . for such systems ,",
    "the rmt modeling is not completely realistic since all many  body systems are effectively governed by one and two  body forces .",
    "this fact motivated work on the two  body random ensembles for fermions  ( see refs .",
    "@xcite to  @xcite ) and inspired the pioneering work of french and collaborators on the subject .",
    "especially , it led to the introduction of the @xmath2body embedded ensembles by mon and french  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the embedded ensembles ( ee ) , stochasticity is generated at the @xmath2body level .",
    "the matrix of the @xmath2body interaction is then taken between @xmath0particle states with @xmath5 .",
    "the latter are obtained by distributing @xmath0 particles over @xmath1 degenerate single  particle levels . for @xmath6 ,",
    "the matrix elements of the @xmath2body interaction in the space of @xmath0body states are correlated .",
    "the number of independent random variables is much smaller than in rmt .",
    "the question arose whether these more realistic ensembles yield the same results as rmt .",
    "early numerical experiments performed for interacting fermion systems  @xcite of rather small matrix dimension showed that spectral fluctuation properties of the ee agreed with those of rmt .",
    "for bosonic systems , manfredi  @xcite argued that the spectral fluctuations should coincide with the predictions of rmt .",
    "more recently patel _ et al . _",
    "@xcite performed simulations for a bosonic case with @xmath7 and concluded that the agreement with rmt carries over into the so  called dense limit . as far as we know , there are no results on the ergodic behavior of the ee for boson systems .",
    "interest in model hamiltonians with random two  body interactions has resurged in recent years in several areas of many  body physics ( see refs .",
    "@xcite to  @xcite ) , and the question of possible further differences between such models and rmt has resurfaced . for instance , altshuler _ et al . _",
    "@xcite suggested localization in fock space as a realistic possibility in a system of interacting electrons in a random one  body potential . in a different context , calculations using random two  body interactions within the nuclear shell ",
    "model  @xcite and in the framework of the interacting boson model  @xcite led to the observation of pairing properties and band structures in the spectra .",
    "these `` regular '' features in the low  lying part of the spectrum are robust and seem to contradict the expectations based on the canonical ensembles of rmt .",
    "recently , three of the present authors found a novel analytical approach to the fermionic embedded ensembles  @xcite in the limit of infinite matrix dimension ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the main results of this approach are : ( i )  within a certain parameter range ( @xmath9 ) , the average spectrum has semicircle shape , and the spectral fluctuation properties coincide with those of rmt .",
    "( ii )  the spectral density changes shape at or near @xmath10 and becomes gaussian .",
    "( iii )  in the dilute limit ( @xmath11 ) the spectral fluctuations are completely uncorrelated ( poissonian ) .",
    "( iv )  the spectral fluctuations change gradually from wigner ",
    "dyson to poissonian .    in this paper",
    ", we extend our analytical treatment to the case of the @xmath2body embedded gaussian ensembles of random matrices for bosonic systems .",
    "our motivation for doing so is twofold .",
    "first , it is instructive to understand possible differences arising from symmetry ( fully symmetric versus fully antisymmetric states ) . to this theoretical argument",
    "we add a second and more practical consideration : in an atomic trap , bosonic atoms occupy partly degenerate single  particle states .",
    "the interaction will lift the degeneracy .",
    "a random  matrix approach should reveal the generic features of the resulting spectrum .",
    "our approach is largely patterned after the one for fermionic systems which in turn is based on the invariance properties of the ee .",
    "we focus attention on the second moment @xmath12 of the random @xmath2body interaction in the hilbert space of many",
    " body states .",
    "we derive an eigenvector expansion formally equivalent to the fermionic one .",
    "we exploit this formal equivalence and obtain results for the shape of the spectral density and for the spectral fluctuations in terms of the parameters @xmath2 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 of the problem .",
    "all our results are obtained in the limit of infinite hilbert  space dimension . for bosons",
    "this limit is realized either by letting @xmath3 ( the same limit as for fermions ) , or by letting @xmath4 with @xmath2 and @xmath1 fixed .",
    "this second case is novel and has no analogue in the fermionic case .",
    "we refer to this case as to the dense limit .",
    "the tools at our disposal are the supersymmetry method  @xcite and the binary correlation method .",
    "neither of these methods really works in the dense limit except to show that standard wigner ",
    "dyson statistics will not apply .",
    "therefore , we resort here to numerical simulations .",
    "the bosonic embedded ensembles are defined in such a way that for @xmath13 , they coincide with one of the standard ensembles of rmt .",
    "deviations can occur only for @xmath6 . in the dilute limit ( @xmath14 )",
    "there is no difference between bosons and fermions .",
    "therefore , we expect that the embedded ensembles for fermions and bosons are qualitatively similar as long as @xmath15 .",
    "this is indeed what we find .",
    "the physically most interesting and novel case is , therefore , the dense limit . here , we prove analytically that the ensemble is not ergodic .",
    "numerical results for the spectral correlations are obtained both by ensemble unfolding and by spectral unfolding . in the latter case",
    "we find a strong tendency of the spectra towards picket  fence behavior .",

    "we attribute this non  ergodic behavior of the ensemble to the slow rate at which the eigenvalues @xmath111 decrease as @xmath94 increases .",

    "such finite corrections imply that the saddle  point solution is no longer appropriate in the dense limit , and deviations from wigner  dyson statistics must occur .",
    "we conclude that in the dense limit , begue(@xmath2 ) possesses spectral fluctuations which deviate significantly from the predictions of rmt . as mentioned above , we attribute this feature to the fact that the number of independent random variables of the ensemble remains the same as @xmath0 increases , see section  [ num ] .",
    "alternatively , we attribute this result to the rather slow decrease of the eigenvalues @xmath233 with increasing @xmath94 .",
    "contributions other than the canonical term @xmath234 are relevant and give rise to important corrections for the spectral fluctuations .",
    "these features are similar to those characterizing the dilute limit . here , the spectral correlations become poissonian . in that case , however , the function @xmath231 vanishes asymptotically , albeit very slowly .",
    "therefore , the first loop correction of the supersymmetry method is not able to provide solid evidence for non  rmt spectral fluctuations in the dilute limit .",
    "however , in this limit another method is available : the extension of the binary correlation approximation of mon and french  @xcite developed in ref .",
    "this method works equally for bosons and for fermions ( in the dilute limit , the distinction between the two cases disappears ) and , thus , yields identical results : the spectral density acquires gaussian shape , and the spectral fluctuations become poissonian .",
    "in the dense limit , there are no analytical techniques to predict spectral fluctuations . moreover , the bosonic ensembles are not ergodic . therefore ,",
    "unfolding procedures based upon averaging over the ensemble carry a question mark and spectral unfolding is the preferred procedure to study the spectral fluctuations . in this section ,",
    "we present numerical results on the spectral fluctuation properties of begoe(@xmath2 ) for @xmath139 in the dense limit .",
    "we exhibit the difference between spectral unfolding and unfolding by using the average over the ensemble . for brevity ,",
    "the latter method is called ensemble unfolding .",
    "numerically , the dense limit is conveniently modeled by taking @xmath235 .",
    "the dimension of hilbert space is then given by @xmath236 ( cf .",
    "( [ eq2.5 ] ) ) , and the situation @xmath237 can be easily attained numerically .",

    "then , the hamiltonian matrix attains a band structure , with non  zero matrix elements on the main diagonal and on the @xmath2 closest diagonals .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the physically most relevant case @xmath139 .",
    "the evaluation of measures of spectral fluctuations requires that individual spectra be unfolded : the average level spacing must be constant .",
    "spectra can be unfolded in two ways .",
    "spectral unfolding consists in handling each spectrum independently .",
    "one looks for a transformation which yields the value unity for the average level spacing . this transformation need not be the same for different spectra .",
    "ensemble unfolding uses the average spectral density ( obtained by averaging all spectra in the ensemble ) to find a single transformation which is then applied to all spectra of the ensemble .",
    "spectral unfolding is typically done by fitting a polynomial to the staircase function of each realization of the ensemble . in the results presented below ,",
    "we have determined the degree of the polynomial for each realization by taking the value which gives the first minimum of the associated @xmath247 when increasing the degree starting from 1 .",
    "the maximum degree considered was 20 .",
    "typically the first minimum was found around 11 .",
    "ensemble unfolding is usually preceded by removing the fluctuations of the center and of the width  @xcite .",
    "all spectra are recentered and rescaled so as to have a common center and width .",
    "this procedure is essentially equivalent to the more sophisticated method used in refs .",
    "@xcite which corrects higher moments of the distribution and relies strongly on the gaussian shape of the average spectrum .",
    "the recentered and rescaled individual spectra are then superposed to obtain the ensemble  averaged spectral density and the staircase function for the ensemble .",
    "the latter is fitted with a polynomial , and each spectrum of the ensemble is unfolded using this polynomial . however , for the bosonic ensembles in the dense limit , this procedure yields a non  gaussian average level density as a consequence of the non  ergodic behavior of the ensemble .",
    "therefore , we did not recenter and rescale the individual spectra for constructing the ensemble  averaged spectral density and the corresponding staircase function .",
    "we have used a polynomial of degree @xmath248 for fitting the average staircase function .",
    "the stability of the results has been checked by varying the degree of the polynomial and the size of the bins used to construct the average spectral density .",

    "the integral over each histogram is normalized to @xmath251 , the dimension of hilbert space . in the figure ,",
    "we have also plotted a gaussian density ( dashed curve ) , whose width is given by the theoretical prediction eq .",
    "( [ eq5.5 ] ) .",
    "comparison of the ensemble  averaged density with this curve confirms the prediction of a gaussian shape of the average spectrum .",
    "the striking differences between each of the two spectral densities and between those and the ensemble  averaged spectral density illustrate the non  ergodic character of the bosonic ensemble for @xmath237 .",
    "the gaussian form of the average spectrum arises as a consequence of the central limit theorem .",
    "it has no bearing on individual spectral shapes .",
    "we turn to the spectral fluctuation properties of begoe(@xmath252 ) .",
    "we have analyzed @xmath249 members of the ensemble for @xmath250 .",
    "after fitting the polynomials , including all levels of each realization for both spectral and ensemble unfolding , we only considered @xmath253 of all levels , i.e. , @xmath254 levels for each realization .",

    "unfolding the level repulsion characteristic of the goe is clearly lost . on the other hand",
    ", the tail of the distribution decays rather rapidly in comparison to the exponential decay of the poisson distribution . for spectral unfolding the distribution @xmath255 is dominated by a prominent peak centered at @xmath256",
    "this suggests that individual spectra have an almost constant level spacing , i.e. , are nearly of picket  fence type ( one  dimensional harmonic oscillator ) .",
    "the two  point correlations of the spectra are characterized by the @xmath257statistics of dyson and mehta measured at the centers of the spectra and shown in fig .",
    "we have computed @xmath258 directly from the spectra using the expression derived by bohigas and giannoni  @xcite . for comparison",

    "the results presented above show the deviations from rmt behavior expected after ensemble unfolding . for spectral unfolding the results suggest that spectra of individual realizations have a very rigid structure with an almost constant spacing in some regions of the spectrum .",
    "we now describe in more detail the structure of individual spectra .",
    "while we do not have a full analytical understanding for the tendency towards picket  fence behavior , we believe that the following observations are related to the small number of independent random variables of the bosonic ensemble for @xmath237 , and to the associated graph structure .    fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the staircase function @xmath264 for a typical realization of the ensemble ( @xmath139 , @xmath238 ) for @xmath265 .",

    "this behavior suddenly changes at the level @xmath267 .",
    "while the spacing between neighboring levels is no longer constant , the spacing between next  to  nearest  neighbors is and is almost the same as it was before level @xmath267 appeared .",
    "this is illustrated by the vertical lines plotted above and below the staircase function .",
    "we remark that these observations imply non  stationary properties of the spectra .",

    "such spectra would lead to results like those in figs .",
    "[ fig3](b ) and  [ fig4](b ) .",
    "we notice that if we were to use for spectral unfolding a piecewise polynomial fit instead of a polynomial fit covering the whole spectrum , the rigid features of the spectrum would appear in an even more convincing form in the spectral statistics .",
    "we have not pursued this point further .",
    "if the spectra do possess the structure proposed above , eigenfunctions belonging to different segments of the spectrum should differ qualitatively . to verify this hypothesis",
