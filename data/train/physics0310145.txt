    "at the durham statistics in physics conference ( 2002 ) , s. towers@xcite noted some of the problems that occur when one uses many , correlated variables in a multivariate analysis and proposed a heuristic method to shrink the number . in this note a semi - automatic method is suggested help with this problem .",
    "the miniboone experiment is faced with just such a problem , distinguishing @xmath0 events from background events given a large number of variables obtained from the event reconstructions .",
    "the fisher discriminant method is a standard method for obtaining a single variable to distinguish hypotheses starting from a large number of variables . if the initial variables come from a multi - normal distribution , the fisher variable encapsulates all of the discrimination information .",
    "however , in many problems the variables are not of this form and the fisher variable , although useful , is not sufficient .    the fisher discriminant method @xcite finds the linear combination @xmath1 of the initial variables @xmath2 which maximizes @xmath3,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the mean value of the variable and var is the variance .",
    "if @xmath5 is the correlation matrix for the original variables corresponding to the denominator , then the inverse of @xmath5 dotted into @xmath6 , gives the combination which maximizes the preceding expression .",
    "if the distribution is not multi - normal , there is information still to be obtained after finding the fisher variable .",
    "it is then useful to apply this method successively , firstly to the original variables and , afterwards , to several non - linear transformations of the variables .",
    "presently , three transformations are chosen : the logarithms of the original variables , the exponentials of the original variables and the cube of the original variables . together with the original variables , this is then four choices .",
    "the present note describes a work in progress .",
    "it is highly likely that these are not optimum and that better choices can and will be found .",
    "indeed , it is likely that the optimum choice depends on the problem .",
    "the method is also used with the original denominator , @xmath7 $ ] and then with each individual variance in turn .",
    "this is done since some of the variables may be quite narrow for signal and wide for background or vice versa .",
    "( see figure 1 ) there are then @xmath8 variables obtained with this method .",
    "start with equal monte carlo samples of signal and background events * \\2 .",
    "multiply and translate each variable to have an overall mean of zero and unit variance .",
    "it is useful to fold variables if necessary to maximize the difference in means .",
    "a few events , very far out on the tails of the distribution are clipped ( @xmath9 ) . *",
    "order the variables according to @xmath10 divided by the smallest of the signal and background variances . at present , the ordering of variables is done only once . *",
    "apply this extended fisher method to the appropriate transformation of the variables .",
    "use the gram - schmidt procedure to make the other variables have zero correlation coefficient with the chosen linear combination . *",
    "the new variable is a linear combination of the original @xmath11 variables .",
    "one variable must be discrded to have an independent set .",
    "discard the least significant ( by the criterion of step 3 ) of the original variables . using the @xmath12",
    "non - fisher variables , go back to step 2 to get the next variable .    for miniboone",
    "the roefitter reconstruction started with 49 particle identification variables . using the steps outlined , these were reduced to 12 variables . when @xmath0 quasi - elastic events were compared with background neutral current @xmath13 events , the use of this procedure with a neural net kept 46% of the @xmath0 and reduced the @xmath14 ratio to 1.1% of its original value .",
    "the neural net was not hard to tune .",
    "the reconstruction ",
    "particle identification package is still being improved , so these numbers will improve further .",
    "the results obtained here are similar to those obtained using a more elaborate neural net on a subsample of 26 of the original 49 variables .        99 s. tower , _ benefits of minimizing the number of discriminators used in a multivariate analysis _ , durham conference on statistics ( 2002 ) .",
