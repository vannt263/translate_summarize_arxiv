    "an activity of many astrophysical sources ( active galactic nuclei , young stellar objects , galactic x - ray sources , microquasars ) is associated with the accretion . for this reason ,",
    "the accretion onto compact objects ( neutron stars or black holes ) is the classical problem of modern astrophysics ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . at present the analytical approach",
    ", whose foundation was laid back in the mid - twentieth century  @xcite , began to be supplanted by numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "analytical solutions were found only in exceptional cases  @xcite .    it should be emphasized that last time the focus of the research has been shifted to numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations , within which framework it has become possible to take into account the turbulent processes associated with magnetic reconnection , magnetorotational instability , etc .",
    "however , in our opinion , some important features of the turbulent accretion can still be understood on the ground of simple analytical model .    the problem of turbulent accretion and stellar wind has been discussed in various papers .",
    "@xcite showed that the inclusion of viscosity and heat conduction allows to remove singularity at the sonic surface and leads to the appearance of weak non - rankine - hugoniot shock waves in the solutions .",
    "@xcite examined the spatial stability of spherical adiabatic bondi accretion on to a point gravitating mass against external vortex perturbations .",
    "@xcite also discussed the role of turbulence in a spherically symmetric accreting system . in their paper",
    "it was shown that the sonic horizon of the transonic inflow solution is shifted inwards , in comparison with inviscid flow , as a consequence of dynamical scaling for sound propogation in accretion process .",
    "@xcite formulated a model of spherically symmetric accretion flow in the presence of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "in this paper we show on the ground of the simple model how the turbulence affects the structure of the spherically symmetric accretion . in the first part",
    ", we formulate the basic equations of ideal steady - state axisymmetric hydrodynamics , which are known to be reduced to one second - order equation for the stream function .",
    "then , in the second part , the structure of the solitary curl is discussed in detail .",
    "finally , in the third part we consider two toy models describing axisymmetric turbulence .",
    "it is shown that the turbulence changes mainly the effective gravity potential but not the effective pressure .",
    "first of all , let us formulate basic hydrodynamical equations describing axisymmetric stationary flows . then , as is well - known , it is convenient to introduce the potential @xmath0 connected with the poloidal velocity @xmath1 and the number density @xmath2 as  @xcite @xmath3 this definition results in the following properties    * the continuity equation @xmath4 is satisfied automatically .",
    "* it is easy to verify that @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is an area element . as seen , the potential @xmath0 is a particle flux through the circle @xmath7 . in particular ,",
    "the total flux through the surface of the sphere of radius @xmath8 is @xmath9 . * as @xmath10 , the velocity vectors @xmath11 are located on the surfaces    in this case , three conservation laws for energy @xmath12 , angular momentum @xmath13 , and the entropy @xmath14 can be formulated as @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the specific enthalpy , and @xmath17 is the gravitational potential .    in what follows",
    "we for simplicity consider the entropy @xmath18 to be constant .",
    "then the equation for the stream function @xmath0 ( which is no more than the projection of the euler equation onto the axis perpendicular to the velocity vector @xmath11 ) looks like ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "this equation represents the balance of forces in a normal direction to flow lines . in partucular , for spherically symmetric flow , i.e. , for @xmath21 const , it has the solution @xmath22    in the following , we deal with the linear angular operator @xmath23 originated from eqn .",
    "( [ gscomp ] ) .",
    "it has eigenfunctions @xmath24 and the eigenvalues @xmath25 here @xmath26 are the legendre polynomials and the dash indicates their derivatives .",
    "let us consider now the small disturbance of the spherically symmetric flow , so that one can write down the flux function as @xmath27   \\label{gssol1new}\\ ] ] with the small parameter @xmath28 . then eqn . ( [ gscomp ] )",
    "can be linearised , while the equation for the perturbation function @xmath29 is written as  @xcite : @xmath30 here @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "this equation allows us to seek the solution in the form @xmath33 introducing now dimensionless variables @xmath34 where the @xmath35-values correspond to the sonic surface ( which can be taken from the zero approximation ) , we can write the ordinary differential equations describing the radial functions @xmath36 : @xmath37 here @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and the expansion coefficients @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 depend on the disturbances as : @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45    finally , the functions @xmath46 and @xmath47 correspond to the spherically symmetric flow . for the polytropic equation of state @xmath48 we use here",
    "they are connected by the relation @xmath49 . as to the dimensionless number density @xmath47 , it can be found from ordinary differential equation @xmath50 with the boundary conditions @xmath51 @xmath52     in region @xmath53 , @xmath54 from 1.1 to 5/3 ]    as for the boundary conditions for the system of eqns .",
    "( [ radialeq ] ) , they are taken analogous to the case of bondi - hoyle accretion  @xcite : @xmath55 ,   \\label{boundg}\\ ] ] @xmath56 where @xmath57 stands for the expansion in terms of the legendre polynomials , which can be found from energy and angular momentum integral perturbations .",
    "now let us consider in detail the internal structure of the quasi - spherical accretion with a small axisymetric perturbation localised near the axis @xmath58 .",
    "in other words , we suppose that the angular size of the vortex is small enough ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the main goal of this numerical calculation is to find the disturbance function @xmath60 which gives us the possibility to determine velocity components @xmath61 and @xmath62 , i.e. , the main characteristics of the perturbed flow .    to model the internal structure of the vortex , we determine @xmath63-dependent angular velocity @xmath64 in the form @xmath65 .   \\label{momentum integral}\\ ] ] here @xmath66 gives the amplitude of considered curl and the coefficient @xmath67 ( which are free parameters of our model ) is an inversed curl width .",
    "certainly , we assume that the perturbation is small in comparison with the main contribution of the radial accretion",
    ".    then the flow structure can be described by the system ( [ radialeq ] ) , ( [ densityeq])([boundderivg ] ) formulated in previous section . as to the expansion coefficients @xmath42 , @xmath41 and @xmath40 , they are to be determined from eqns .",
    "( [ denergy])([dmomentum ] ) and ( [ boundg ] ) on the outer boundary of a flow @xmath68 . for our choice ( [ momentum integral ] )",
    "the disturbances have the form @xmath69   r^2 \\sin^2\\theta}}{2 } + { o(\\varepsilon^3 ) } ,   \\label{energyperturb}\\ ] ] @xmath70 r^2 \\sin^2\\theta}.   \\label{momentumperturb}\\ ] ] as one can easily check , it gives @xmath71",
    ".    expansions ( [ denergy ] ) , ( [ squaremomentum ] ) , and ( [ dmomentum ] ) in terms of @xmath72 contain some numerical difficulties because the set of this functions is not an orthogonal one , and , even though it converges , in our case of very small curl width we can neglect just summands with numbers larger than 50 . even in some trivial cases like @xmath73 these polynomials call a number of numerical obstacles ( e.g. , bad - conditioned matrix of linear equation for coefficients @xmath42 , @xmath41 and @xmath40 , etc ) .    in order to expand functions of integrals , we used the auxiliary set of chebyshev polynomials , which is orthogonal and posesses a feature of generally faster convergence . using these polynomials",
    ", we could find all expansions with the accuracy no worse than @xmath74 . as was shown in sect .",
    "2 , the normalized density function @xmath47 can be derived from the equation ( [ densityeq ] ) and boundary conditions ( [ densityeqbound ] ) and ( [ densityeqboundaries ] ) .",
    "the results of numerical calculations for different polytropic indeces @xmath54 is shown on figure 1 .",
    "in particiular , as one can see , the density is nearly constant in subsonic regime ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "an example of the numerical calculation of perturbation function @xmath29 is shown on figure 2 .",
    "we should stress that @xmath29 turns actually zero outside the small region near the axial curl .",
    "this statement allows us to assume as a zero approximation that the turbulent accretion regime containing a number of curls can be considered as a set of noninteracting ones .",
    "moving towards the accreting star , we can register that perturbation has a maximum on a radius @xmath76 , then diminishes on the distance about @xmath77 and finally rapidly rises in the vicinity of the sonic surface @xmath78 . apart from numerical solution",
    ", we can also find the analytical asymptotic solutions in the supersonic region @xmath79 where eqn .",
    "( [ radialeq ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath80 here we take into account that @xmath81 .",
    "getting rid of all parameters from the right part of this equation , one can introduce a new function @xmath82 .",
    "( [ asympteq1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath83 neglecting now all terms which are proportional to @xmath84 , where @xmath85 , we obtain that this equation has an universal solution independent of the boundary conditions on the outer boundary @xmath68 @xmath86 remember that the same asymptotic behavior was obtained by  @xcite for homogeneously rotating flow .     in region @xmath53 ,",
    "@xmath87 , @xmath88    as was already stressed , numerical results allow us to determine @xmath89 ratio around the curl .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath90 where @xmath91}.   \\label{1}\\ ] ] in our calculation we put @xmath92 , so that the function ( [ 1 ] ) is limited in area near the curl ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "taking now into account that @xmath94 is a small parameter of our expansion and @xmath95 , one can show that for reasonable parameter @xmath94 the ratio @xmath96 in the area of vortex has an order of @xmath97 ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "thus , we could claim that @xmath98 , and then one can neglect the all terms in navier - stokes equations that consist @xmath61 .     ratio in region @xmath99 . ]    on the other hand , it is necessary to stress that , according to ( [ asymptotic ] ) , we can not use our solution close enough to the origin ( @xmath100 ) . indeed , analysing the field line equation @xmath101 , we obtain that the asymptotic solution survives until @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is an initial angular size of a curl and @xmath104 is a broadening parameter of the stream line .",
    "deriving @xmath63-component of the velocity from ( [ b1 ] ) and taking @xmath105 of zero order , we get @xmath106 assuming now that @xmath107 , one can expand equation ( [ crit ] ) in @xmath63 and neglecting all summands of @xmath108 with @xmath109 , we find @xmath110 this equation can be simply integrated , and we obtain @xmath111    hence , under the radius @xmath112 we can not use the solution ( [ asymptotic ] ) as the disturbance becomes larger than unity .",
    "in order to keep the solution up to star surface we should demand @xmath113 where @xmath114 corresponds to the star radius .",
    "it gives us the general condition of appliability of the approach described above . unless we can not use the method of linear expansion of grad - shafranov equation , and the turbulent flow",
    "is to be described in another way which lies outside the consideration of current paper .",
    "let us try now , as have been done in some papers ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite , @xcite ) , to describe the vortex disturbance through some effective pressure , i.e. , to calculate a small correction for the pressure function @xmath115 caused by the presence of turbulent curl .",
    "starting with @xmath63-component of euler equation @xmath116 and neglecting all the terms containing @xmath61 , we obtain @xmath117 expanding this equation near the axis and assuming @xmath118 where @xmath119 const , we obtain @xmath120 it gives for the additional pressure @xmath121 @xmath122 where @xmath123 is an approximate size of a curl .",
    "thus , one can conclude that the pressure @xmath121 has explicit dependence on @xmath8 , which can not be taken into consideration using any equation of state .",
    "hence , we should include the turbulence into the consideration in another way than introducing effective turbulent pressure as often suggested by  @xcite .",
    "let us suppose now that the turbulence in the accreting matter can be described by the large number of axisymmetric vortexes with different parameters @xmath124 and @xmath125 filling all the accreting volume . within this approach one can construct two toy analytical models demonstrating how the turbulence can affect the structure of the spherically symmetric accretion .",
    "the first model in which we neglect viscosity corresponds to classical ideal spherically symmetric bondi accretion  @xcite . in this case",
    "one can consider the following system of equations : @xmath126 following  @xcite we consider polytropic equation of state @xmath127 resulting in for polytropic index @xmath128 @xmath129 here again @xmath2 ( @xmath130 ) is the number density , @xmath131 ( in @xmath132 ) is the mass of particles ( @xmath133 is the mass density ) , @xmath14 is the entropy per one particle ( dimensionless ) , is the specific enthalpy , @xmath134 ( in @xmath135 ) is the temperature in energy units , and , finally , @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) is the sound velocity .    as was demonstrated above , for a weak enough turbulence level ( [ critansw ] ) for any inividual curl one can neglect @xmath63-component of the velocity perturbation in comparison with the toroidal one @xmath62 up to the central body @xmath138 .",
    "thus , in zero approximation one can put @xmath139 , i.e. , @xmath140 const .",
    "this implies that , according to the angular momentum concervation law @xmath141 const , we can write down @xmath142 here @xmath64 is a smooth function of @xmath63 that can be approximately described as : @xmath143    in order to find the characteristic values of the accretion flow we have to use energy and momentum intergals conserving on stream lines .",
    "taking into account an assertion @xmath144 , we can neglect @xmath63-component of velocity which gives @xmath145 averaging now these integrals in @xmath63 and introducing a new value @xmath146 we obtain for the averaged energy integral @xmath147 as we see , two last terms can be considered as effective gravitational potential .",
    "futher calculations are quite similar to the classical bondi problem for the spherical flow . in other words , using another integrals of motion , i.e. , the total particle flux @xmath148 and the entropy @xmath14 , one can rewrite the energy integral ( [ e_av ] ) as @xmath149 it gives the following expression for the logarithmic @xmath8-derivative of the number density @xmath150 as for bondi accretion , this derivative has a singularity on the sonic surface @xmath151 .",
    "this implies that for smooth transition through the sonic surface @xmath152 , the additional condition is to be satisfied : @xmath153    solving now ( [ bondieq ] ) in terms of @xmath154 in this approximation , we find @xmath155 where @xmath156 is evaluated from @xmath157 accordingly , we obtain for @xmath158 and @xmath159 ratios : @xmath160 where @xmath161 and @xmath162 correspond to the classical bondi accretion .",
    "finally , using the definition ( [ avemomentum ] ) for @xmath163 , we can rewrite our criteria of the appliability ( [ critansw ] ) as @xmath164 . as @xmath165",
    ", it can be finally rewritten as @xmath166    to sum up , one can conclude that the nonzero angular momentum effectively decreases the gravitational force .",
    "in other words , the presence of the angular momentum do not allow matter to fall down as easy as in its absence .",
    "roughly speaking , we substitute our gravitating center with one that posesses less mass .",
    "so , in the case of bondi accretion with a small angular momentum perturbation we should modify the relations for sonic surface radius and velocity  they decrease and rise respectively .",
    "it is important to note that we can consider turbulent accretion regime as one with a modified gravity potential .       for @xmath167    it this subsection",
    "we consider stationary axisymmetric quasi - spherical flow of viscous fluid .",
    "using the condition @xmath144 , and neglecting all the terms containing @xmath61 , we obtain for @xmath168-component of euler equation  @xcite @xmath169 for viscous flow it is convenient to determine the toroidal component of the velocity @xmath170 as @xmath171 where we will use the following form for the angular velocity @xmath172 : @xmath173 .",
    "\\label{om}\\ ] ] here @xmath174 is an amplitude , and @xmath175 is a square of effective angular width of an individual curl . substituting now @xmath170 into eqn .",
    "( [ ll ] ) , we obtain @xmath176 ,   \\label{54}\\ ] ] where @xmath177 is the accretion rate remaining constant in stationary flow , and @xmath178 is a dynamic viscous coefficient which can be considered as a constant as well  @xcite .",
    "using now eqn .",
    "( [ 54 ] ) , one can easily show that the total angular momentum of an individual vortex conserves ( @xmath179 ) .",
    "indeed , internal friction connecting with viscosity can not change the total angular momentum of the accreting matter .",
    "for this reason , together with ( [ accretionrate ] ) , the angular momentum @xmath180 can be rewritten as a full @xmath63-derivative .",
    "this implies that the r.h.s .",
    "( [ 56 ] ) intergated over @xmath63 becomes zero .",
    "further , to determine the radial dependence of the curl amplitude @xmath181 and the squared width @xmath182 , we substitute the angular velocity @xmath183 ( [ om ] ) into ( [ ll ] ) and expand it in terms of @xmath63 near the axis , neglecting all the terms with the power more than 3 . as a result ,",
    "we obtain two equations for @xmath181 and @xmath182 @xmath184 @xmath185 which have simple solutions @xmath186^{-2}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] introduction of a small vortex tubulence can be again treated by modifying a gravitational potential as @xmath187^{-3}.\\ ] ]    thus , viscosity results in increasing of the vortex width ( @xmath188 for @xmath189 corresponding to accretion ) and diminishing of the angular rotation . on the other hand ,",
    "the role of viscosity will be small if @xmath190 for @xmath191 we return to the previous result @xmath192 const , @xmath193 .",
    "introducing now reynolds number as @xmath194 where @xmath195 and @xmath196 are characteristic values of a flow and using expression ( [ accretionrate ] ) , we can rewrite ( [ remm ] ) as @xmath197 this implies that the role of viscosity is small for turbulent flow .",
    "certainly , the analysis presented above allows us to take into consideration only isolated set of curls . in reality ,",
    "dense celluar turbulent structure posesses a number of collective effects  @xcite , that is to be described in another way .",
    "the easiest method to proceed with the minimal number of additional assumptions is to choose another angular velocity profile .",
    "as the total angular momentum of the accreting matter is suppose to be zero , we will use the following expression for the angular velocity @xmath198 here the parameter @xmath199 is to be chosen from the condition of the zero total angular momentum @xmath200 which is equivalent to @xmath201 one of its realisations can be seen on figure 4 where the dashed line shows zero angular velocity level .",
    "configuration like this one represents the unit of celluar turbulent structure , fulfilling main requirements of its nature . to simplify our calculations , we hold @xmath199 and @xmath202 on constant values in order to get simple equation on @xmath203 . again , we expand equation ( [ 54 ] ) in terms of @xmath63 to the first order . as a result",
    ", we obtain for @xmath204 : @xmath205 .",
    "\\label{eff3}\\ ] ] in this case , the effective gravitational potential can not be derived for arbitary parameters without special functions .",
    "it can be written as @xmath206,\\ ] ] where @xmath207 choosing , for instanse , @xmath208 and @xmath209 , it gives @xmath210 .",
    "the expression under the exponential function in ( [ eff3 ] ) is always lower than zero , so the criterion of the importance of viscosity effects can be formulated as @xmath211 which is more convinient to discuss in terms of reynolds number @xmath212 thus , for narrow vortex ( i.e. , for @xmath213 ) the viscosity effects must be taken into account .",
    "we have shown that in the case of the vortex turbulence represented by a solitary axisymmetric curl , one can not simulate effects of the turbulence by introduction of the effective pressure which is common in recent papers ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite , @xcite ) . on the other hand , it is possible to take into account the vortex structure of the accreting flow by introducing an effective gravitational potential .",
    "further , we described two analytical toy models that show how the turbulence affects the structure of the spherically symmetric flow .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the sonic surface moves inwards because of effective diminishing of gravitational force . finally , a criterion to analyze the importance of viscosity effects in the adiabatic flow filled either by isolated or dense set of curls was formulated .      anderson  m. , 1989 , mnras , 239 , 19 axford w. i. & newman r. c. , 1967 , astrophys .",
