    "as quantitative trading is generally used by financial institutions and hedge funds , the transactions are usually large in size and may involve the purchase and sale of hundreds of thousands of shares and other securities .",
    "however , quantitative trading is also commonly used by individual investors .",
    "a fundamental part of agency algorithmic trading in equities and other asset classes is trade scheduling . given a trade target , that is",
    ", a number of shares that must be bought or sold before a fixed time horizon , trade scheduling means planning how many shares will be bought or sold by each time instant between the beginning of trading and the horizon .",
    "this is done so as to optimize some measure of execution quality , usually measured as the final average execution price relative to some benchmark price .",
    "almgren and chriss ( 2000 ) consider the execution of portfolio transactions with the aim of minimizing a combination of volatility risk and transaction costs arising from permanent and temporary market impact .",
    "kharroubi and huyn pham(2010 ) study the optimal portfolio liquidation problem over a finite horizon in a limit order book with bid - ask spread and temporary market price impact penalizing speedy execution trades , respectively . almgren ( 2012 ) considers the problem of mean - variance optimal agency execution strategies , when the market liquidity and volatility vary randomly in time .",
    "he constructs an hjb equation relying on `` small impact approximation '' under specific assumptions for the stochastic process satisfied by these parameters .",
    "the mean - variance analysis of markowitz ( 1952 ) has long been recognized as the cornerstone of modern portfolio theory .",
    "attention is regained by relating dynamic mean - variance optimization formalistically to quadratic utility in korn and trautmann ( 1995 ) , korn ( 1997 ) and zhou and li ( 2000 ) .",
    "the same problem is categorized as mean - variance optimization with pre - commitment ( see christiansen and steffensen ( 2013 ) for detailed illutrations ) . recently",
    ", attention has been regained by basak and chabakauri ( 2010 ) who challenge the pre - commitment ( to the time 0-expected value as the target of the quadratic utility ) assumed by zhou and li ( 2000 ) .",
    "they solve the problem for the so - called sophisticated investor who updates his non - linear mean - variance objective and takes future updates , time - consistently , into account . in this paper , the dynamic mean - variance criterion",
    "is applied to the optimal trading problem .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the quantitative trading problem under the dynamic mean - variance criterion and derive time - consistent solutions in three important models .",
    "our paper contributes to the quantitative trading literature in various aspects .",
    "firstly , we solve the dynamic mean - variance quantitative trading problems and derive time - consistent solutions .",
    "we give optimal strategies under a reconsidered mean - variance subject at any point in time .",
    "previous literature seems only give precommitment and deterministic control solutions .",
    "almgren ( 2012 ) gives the trading strategy in the basic model where it is fixed rather than adaptive .",
    "secondly , we determine the explicit solutions when random pricing signals are incorporated . a random pricing signal ,",
    "gathering the information of the index data , trading volume and public and private market events , can be regarded as the indicator of the stock movements .",
    "various methods have been proposed to study the pricing signal in the literature .",
    "introduction to the literature is deferred to section 3 . in this paper , the trading strategy is derived when the random pricing signal is assumed to be a diffusion process .",
    "thirdly , we consider the trading strategy in the case of stochastic volatility and liquidity impact .",
    "we allow the liquidity and volatility to vary randomly in time and the determined trading strategy is adapted to the market state .",
    "we give the generalized hjb equations in the stochastic volatility and liquidity impact models while early study reply on a `` small impact approximation '' ( almgren ( 2012 ) ) .",
    "we also get an explicit solution in a stochastic volatility model with a given structure supported by empirical study .",
    "the remainder of the paper is structured as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we give the trading strategy in the basic model which is adopted from section 1 of almgen ( 2012 ) . in section 3 , optimal strategy",
    "is presented when random pricing signals are incorporated . in section 4 , we consider stochastic volatility and liquidity model .",
    "conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we consider the basic model adopted from almgren ( 2012 ) . in the model ,",
    "the price of a stock is govern by the sde,@xmath0where @xmath1 is the time - dependent volatility of the stock and @xmath2 is a standard brownian motion .",
    "the price actually received on each trade is @xmath3where @xmath4 is the coefficient of temporary market impact , also time - varying and @xmath5 is the rate of buying .",
    "the volatility and impact functions @xmath1 and @xmath4 are assumed to be continuous functions of @xmath6 to account for trading seasonality .",
    "the trader begins at time @xmath7 with a purchase target of @xmath8 shares , which must be completed by time @xmath9 .",
    "the number of shares yet to be purchased at time @xmath6 is the trajectory @xmath10 , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "hence @xmath13the cost of trading , is the total dollars paid to purchase @xmath8 shares subtracting the initial market value : @xmath14by integration by parts , we rewrite @xmath15we determine the optimal trajectory by the dynamic mean - variance criterion @xmath16this is newly proposed by basak and chabakuri ( 2010 ) , who come up with the dynamic mean - variance criterion challenging the pre - commitment mean - variance assumed by korn ( 1997 ) and zhou and li ( 2000 ) .",
    "basak and chabakuri ( 2010 ) use this criterion in asset allocation problem for the so - called sophisticated investor who updates his nonlinear mean - variance objective and takes future updates , time - consistently , into account .    to address the optimal trading problem",
    ", we define a process @xmath17 by @xmath18such that @xmath19 .",
    "our objective becomes @xmath20by ( [ eq4y ] ) , we know @xmath21suppose that we are given an optimal trading strategy @xmath22 , and the corresponding value of @xmath23 .",
    "the value function is defined as @xmath24noting that by the law of total variance,@xmath25plugging ( [ totalvariance ] ) into ( [ eq4j ] ) , we obtain @xmath26from ( [ eq4y ] ) , we know @xmath27where @xmath28besides , plugging ( [ eq4y ] ) into ( [ eq4j ] ) we also know @xmath29where @xmath30does not depend on @xmath31 .",
    "the hjb equation concerning the optimal trading problem is given by @xmath32 where the minimum is clearly @xmath33 and @xmath34 satisfies @xmath35    combining ( [ eq4j2 ] ) , ( [ eq4y* ] ) and ( [ eq4separation ] ) , we obtain @xmath36using the it@xmath37 s lemma , ( [ eq4x ] ) , ( [ eq4y ] ) and after inserting @xmath38 , @xmath39hence ( [ hjb ] ) follows and the optimal strategy is given by @xmath40 .",
    "together with ( [ eq4f ] ) , ( [ eq4f2 ] ) follows .",
    "consequently , the two pdes for @xmath41 and @xmath34 can be derived as follows @xmath42    from ( [ cal ] ) , we see that the optimal strategy @xmath43 does not depend on @xmath31 and @xmath44 for @xmath45 . hence , @xmath46 depends only on @xmath47 and @xmath48 . combining ( [ eq4x ] ) , @xmath49 is a deterministic control and @xmath50 is a deterministic process .",
    "therefore , ( [ eq4pdec ] ) reduced to @xmath51the initial data for the pde ( [ eq4pde2 ] ) is a local asymptotic condition . considering ( [ negligible ] ) , near expiration @xmath52 , the terms with @xmath53 become negligible , then we must liquidate on a linear trajectory @xmath54 and hence the function @xmath41 has local behavior @xmath55we look for a candidate solution to hjb in the form @xmath56 plugging into the hjb , we see that @xmath57 should satisfy the ode : @xmath58and @xmath59the optimal strategy is given by @xmath60 if we restrict @xmath61 and @xmath62 to be constant , @xmath63the optimal strategy can be expressed as @xmath64 this is the same strategy as the one obtained by almgren ( 2012 ) . however , it is important to realize that the problem formulations are different . whereas almgren ( 2012 ) finds the best deterministic strategy for a classical mean - variance problem",
    ", we find the best stochastic strategy for a time - consistent formulation of the mean - variance problem .",
    "since the best strategy is deterministic , time - consistency does not distinguish the two problems and the two strategies coincide .",
    "however , when we proceed and add randomness from signals , volatility , and liquidity , this coincidence is lost , since our strategies become adapted and reflect specifically the time - consistency of the problem formulation .",
    "we consider the trading problem of mean - variance optimal agency execution strategies , when a random pricing signal is included . a random pricing signal , gathering the information of index data , trading volume and public and private market events , can be regarded as the indicator of the stock movement .",
    "various research work have considered pricing signals for the support and prediction of limit and market order placement strategies of traders .",
    "interested readers are advised to refer to milgrom and stokey ( 1982 ) and suominen ( 2001 ) .",
    "the model with random pricing signals enhances the trading quantity for two reasons .",
    "first , the incorporation of pricing signals relates stock returns to market returns .",
    "one can identify the pricing signals by investigating statistical and normal relationships between an asset s returns and market factors .",
    "some notable examples of understanding the relationships between stock returns and market returns include the camp model by sharpe ( 1964 ) , the common risk factor model by fama and french ( 1993 ) , the extended four - factor model by carhart ( 1997 ) and the garch model by lamoureux and lastrapes ( 1990 ) .",
    "second , the model replies on the belief that extreme price movements are caused by temporary liquidity shortage and manipulation and would be followed by a price reversal , which is consistent with the market behavior . in our model",
    ", the price reversal is described be a reverting process with rate @xmath65 .",
    "another example of the incorporation of random pricing signals is pairs trading .",
    "the strategy monitors performance of two historically correlated securities , e.g. coca - cola ( ko ) and pepsi ( pep ) .",
    "when the correlation between the two securities temporarily weakens , i.e. one stock moves up while the other moves down , the pairs trade would be to short the outperforming stock and to long the underperforming one , betting that the `` spread '' between the two would eventually converge ( see mudchanatongsuk et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ) .",
    "one can identify the pricing signals by investigating the average stock movements of the pair of stocks and finding the optimal trading strategy under the mean - variance criterion by our approach .    to be more specific ,",
    "the price of a stock is govern by sdes : @xmath66where @xmath67 is a random pricing signal , @xmath65 the rate by which the shock dissipate and the variable reverts towards the signal , @xmath68 is the volatility of the stock and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are independent standard brownian motions .",
    "we assume @xmath65 , @xmath4 , @xmath68 and @xmath71 are continuously time - varying to account for trading seasonality .",
    "the cost of trading , is the total dollars paid to purchase @xmath50 shares subtracting the initial market value : @xmath72we determine the optimal trajectory by the dynamic mean - variance criterion @xmath16we now follow the recipe presented in the previous section and define a process @xmath17 as @xmath73such that @xmath74 .",
    "our objective becomes @xmath20suppose that we are given an optimal trading strategy @xmath22 , and the corresponding value of @xmath23 .",
    "the value function is defined as @xmath75by the law of total variance , we obtain @xmath76from ( [ eq4y2 ] ) , we know @xmath77where @xmath78besides , plugging ( [ eq4y2 ] ) into ( [ eq4j ] ) we also know @xmath79where @xmath80does not depend on @xmath31 .",
    "to proceed , we reduce the dimension of the hjb by defining a new variable : @xmath81the difference between the stock price and the observable signal .",
    "we can easily see that function @xmath82 and @xmath83 depend only on @xmath84 and @xmath85    the hjb equation concerning the optimal trading problem with random signal is given by @xmath86 where the minimum is clearly @xmath33 and @xmath34 satisfies @xmath87    combining ( [ eq4j2 ] ) , ( [ eq4y * ] ) and ( [ eq4separation ] ) , we obtain @xmath88 using the it@xmath37 s lemma , ( [ eq4x ] ) , ( [ eq4y3 ] ) , ( eq4beta ) and after inserting @xmath89 , @xmath90 hence ( [ hjb ] ) follows and the optimal strategy is given by @xmath91 .",
    "together with ( [ eq4f ] ) , ( [ eq4f2 ] ) follows .",
    "consequently , the two pdes for @xmath41 and @xmath34 can be derived as follows @xmath92similar to the local asymptotic condition in the basic model , near expiration , one must liquidate on a linear trajectory .",
    "therefore , @xmath93we look for a candidate solution to pdes in the form @xmath94we plug ( [ eq4cf ] ) into ( [ eq4pdec ] ) ( [ eq4pdef ] ) and obtain a system of odes .",
    "@xmath95from ( [ odes ] ) , one can find that solutions to @xmath96 are trivial , i.e. , @xmath97 .",
    "hence the optimal strategy becomes @xmath98which only evolves @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , ( [ odes ] ) can be reduced to ( [ odess ] ) , which gives the optimal strategy .",

    "we provide an example to capture stochastic volatility and time - varying liquidity impact , where we assume @xmath126 .",
    "blais and protter ( 2010 ) examine the structure of the supply curve using tick data .",
    "they find that for highly liquid stocks , the supply curve is effectively linear , with a slope that varies with time .",
    "their empirical analysis also indicates the slope has a small variance .",
    "this supports we use a time - varying liquidity impact @xmath127 .",
    "empirical investigations ( jones , kaul and lipson ( 1994 ) ) reveal a significantly positive relation between trade size , volume of transactions and stock volatility . if from time @xmath6 to @xmath52 , liquidity of the stock is mainly provided by the trader .",

    "the average speed of liquidity is fixed from @xmath128 to @xmath52 , i.e. , @xmath129 .",
