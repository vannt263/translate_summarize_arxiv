    "the most important feature of a toric variety @xmath0 is that it is completely described by a fan @xmath1 in the lattice @xmath2 of one parameter subgroups of the big torus @xmath3 .",
    "applying a linear gale transformation to the set of primitive generators @xmath4 of the rays @xmath5 of @xmath1 , gives a new vector configuration in a rational vector space @xmath6 .",
    "this opens an alternative combinatorial approach to the toric variety @xmath0 : the vector space @xmath6 is isomorphic to the rational divisor class group of @xmath0 , and one can shift combinatorial information between the spaces @xmath7 and @xmath6 .    in toric geometry , this principle has been used to study the projective case , compare  @xcite : roughly speaking , if we consider all fans @xmath8 in @xmath2 having their rays among @xmath9 , then the ( quasi-)projective @xmath8 correspond to so called gelfand - kapranov - zelevinski cones in @xmath6 .",
    "these cones subdivide the cone generated by the gale transform of the vector configuration @xmath10 , and the birational geometry of the associated toric varieties is reflected by the position of their gelfand - kapranov - zelevinski cones .    if one leaves the ( quasi-)projective setting , then there are generalizations of gelfand - kapranov - zelevinski cones , compare e.g.  @xcite ; but so far there seems to be no concept which is simple enough to serve for practical purposes in toric geometry .",
    "our aim is to fill this gap and to propose a natural combinatorial language which also works in the non quasiprojective case .",
    "the combinatorial data are certain collections  which we call _ bunches _  of overlapping cones in the vector space of rational divisor classes .",
    "as we shall see , this approach gives very natural descriptions of geometric phenomena connected with divisors .    in order to give a first impression of the language of bunches ,",
    "let us present it here for in a special case , namely for toric varieties with free class group .",
    "consider a sequence @xmath11 of not necessarily pairwise distinct points , called _ weight vectors _ , in a lattice @xmath12 . by a _ weight cone",
    "_ in @xmath13 we then mean a ( convex polyhedral ) cone @xmath14 generated by some of the @xmath15 .",
    "a _ ( free standard ) bunch _ in @xmath13 is a nonempty collection @xmath16 of weight cones in @xmath13 with the following properties :    1 .",
    "a weight cone @xmath17 in @xmath13 belongs to @xmath16 if and only if @xmath18 holds for all @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "2 .   for each @xmath21 ,",
    "the set @xmath22 generates @xmath13 as a lattice , and there is a @xmath19 such that @xmath23 holds for the relative interiors .    how to construct a toric variety from such a bunch @xmath16 ?",
    "the first step is to _ unpack _ the combinatorial information encoded in @xmath16 . for this , let @xmath24 , and let @xmath25 denote the linear surjection sending the canonical base vector @xmath26 to @xmath15",
    ". denote by @xmath27 the positive orthant .",
    "we define the _ covering collection _ of @xmath16 as @xmath28    the next step is to _ dualize _ the information contained in @xmath29 .",
    "this is done by a procedure close to a linear gale transformation , for the classical setup see e.g.  @xcite and  @xcite : consider the exact sequence arising from @xmath25 , and the corresponding dualized exact sequence : @xmath30 &      { m } \\ar[r ] &      { e } \\ar[r]^{q } &       k \\ar[r ] &        0 ,   } \\ ] ] @xmath30 &      { l } \\ar[r ] &      { f } \\ar[r]^{p } &       { n } \\ar[r ] &        0 . } \\ ] ]    note that @xmath31 is not the dual homomorphism of @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath33 be the dual cone of @xmath27 .",
    "the crucial observation then is that we obtain a fan @xmath34 in the lattice @xmath2 having as its maximal cones the images @xmath35    the _ toric variety associated to the bunch _ @xmath16 is @xmath36 .",
    "the toric variety @xmath37 is _ nondegenerate _ in the sense that it has no torus factors .",
    "moreover , @xmath37 is _ 2-complete _ , that means if @xmath38 is an open toric embedding such that the complement @xmath39 is of codimension at least 2 , then @xmath40 .",
    "consider the sequence @xmath41 of weight vectors in @xmath42 and the bunch @xmath43 in @xmath44 .",
    "then we have @xmath45 , and the associated linear map @xmath46 sends @xmath26 to @xmath21 . the covering collection @xmath29 consists of the following three faces of @xmath47 : @xmath48",
    "if we identify the dual space @xmath49 with @xmath50 , then the cone @xmath51 is again @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , we may identify @xmath2 with @xmath53 and thus realize the map @xmath31 via the matrix @xmath54\\ ] ] each @xmath55 equals @xmath56 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "hence the images @xmath59 , which are the maximal cones of the fan @xmath34 , are given in terms of the canonical base vectors @xmath60 as @xmath61 consequently , the toric variety @xmath37 associated to the bunch @xmath16 equals the weighted projective space @xmath62 .    introducing a suitable notion of a morphism , we can extend the assignment @xmath63 from bunches to 2-complete nondegenerate toric varieties to a contravariant functor .",
    "in fact , we even obtain a weak antiequivalence , see theorem  [ standard2maximal ] :    the functor @xmath63 induces a bijection on the level of isomorphism classes of bunches and nondegenerate 2-complete toric varieties . in particular , every complete toric variety arises from a bunch .    in order to read off geometric properties of @xmath37 directly from the bunch @xmath16 , one has to translate the respective fan - theoretical formulations via the above gale transformation into the language of bunches .",
    "this gives for example :    * @xmath37 is @xmath64-factorial if and only if every cone @xmath19 is of full dimension , see proposition  [ qfactorialchar ] .",
    "* @xmath37 is smooth if and only if for every @xmath65 in @xmath29 , the image @xmath66 equals @xmath13 , see proposition  [ smoothchar ] . *",
    "the orbits @xmath37 have fixed points in their closures if and only if all cones @xmath67 , where @xmath68 , are simplicial , see proposition  [ existenoffixedpointschar ] .",
    "as mentioned , the power of the language of bunches lies in the description of geometric phenomena around divisors , because @xmath6 turns out to be the rational divisor class group of @xmath37 .",
    "for example , we obtain very simple descriptions for the classes of rational cartier divisors , the cone @xmath69 of semiample classes and the cone @xmath70 of ample classes , see theorem  [ qcartier ] :    for the toric variety @xmath37 arising from a bunch @xmath16 , there are canonical isomorphisms : @xmath71    note that the last isomorphism gives a quasiprojectivity criterion in the spirit of  @xcite and  @xcite , see corollary  [ ewaldcrit ] .",
    "moreover , we can derive from the above theorem a simple fano criterion , see corollary  [ fanocrit ] .",
    "finally , we get back reid s toric cone theorem , see  @xcite , even with a new description of the mori cone , see corollary  [ moricone ] :    suppose that @xmath37 is complete and simplicial .",
    "then the cone of numerically effective curve classes in @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 in particular , this cone is convex and polyhedral .",
    "moreover , @xmath37 is projective if and only if @xmath74 is strictly convex .",
    "bunches can also be used for classification problems .",
    "for example , once the machinery is established , kleinschmidt s classification  @xcite becomes very simple and can even be slightly improved , see proposition  [ kleinschmidt ] ; below we represent a sequence of weight vectors as a set of vectors @xmath75 , each of which carries a multiplicity @xmath76 :    the smooth 2-complete toric varieties @xmath0 with @xmath77 correspond to bunches @xmath78 given by    * weight vectors @xmath79 , and @xmath80 with @xmath81 , * multiplicities @xmath82 with @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .    moreover , the toric variety @xmath0 defined by such a bunch @xmath16 is always projective , and it is fano if and only if we have @xmath86    in general the functor from bunches to toric varieties is neither injective nor surjective on morphisms , see examples  [ freegroup ] and  [ notfaithfull ] .",
    "but if we restrict to @xmath64-factorial toric varieties , then the language of bunches provides also a tool for the study of toric morphisms , see theorem  [ equivcat ] :    there is an equivalence from the category of simple bunches to the category of full @xmath64-factorial toric varieties .",
    "we would like to thank the referee for his careful reading and for various helpful comments and corrections .",
    "in this section , we recall some basic facts on the correspondence between fans and toric varieties , and thereby fix our notation used later . for details",
    ", we refer to the books of oda  @xcite and fulton  @xcite .",

    "the set of the @xmath96-dimensional faces of @xmath17 is denoted by @xmath97 , and the one - dimensional faces of a strictly convex cone are called rays .    the primitive generators of a strictly convex cone @xmath17 in a lattice @xmath2 are the primitive lattice vectors of its rays . a strictly convex cone in @xmath2",
    "is called simplicial if its primitive generators are linearly independent , and it is called regular if its primitive generators can be complemented to a lattice basis of @xmath2 .    [ fandefi ]    1 .",
    "a _ fan _ in a lattice @xmath2 is a finite collection @xmath1 of strictly convex cones in @xmath2 such that for each @xmath98 also all @xmath94 belong to @xmath1 and for any two @xmath99 we have @xmath100 .",
    "2 .   a _ map of fans _",
    "@xmath101 in lattices @xmath102 is a lattice homomorphism @xmath103 such that for every @xmath104 there is a @xmath105 containing @xmath106 .",
    "recall that the compatibility condition @xmath100 in the above definition is equivalent to the existence of a _ separating linear form _ for the cones @xmath107 and @xmath108 , i.e. , a linear form @xmath109 on @xmath2 such that @xmath110    if we replace in definition  [ fandefi ] `` strictly convex '' with `` convex '' , we obtain the category of _",

    ", we shall often make use of a well known universal lifting construction , which makes the set of primitive generators of the rays of a given fan into a lattice basis , compare for example  @xcite :    [ coxconstr ] let @xmath1 be a fan in a lattice @xmath2 , and let @xmath114 .",

    "the assignment @xmath134 is functorial ; it is even a ( covariant ) equivalence of categories .    in the sequel",
    ", we shall frequently restrict our investigations to toric varieties that behave reasonably .",
    "for that purpose , we consider the following geometric properties :    [ nondegfulldef ]    1 .   a toric variety @xmath0 is called _ nondegenerate _ if it admits no toric decomposition @xmath135 .",

    "[ section2 ]    in this section , we introduce the language of bunches .",
    "intuitively , one should think of a bunch as a collection of pairwise overlapping lattice cones , which satisfies certain irredundancy and maximality properties .",
    "the precise definition of the category of bunches is performed in three steps .",
    "the first one is to introduce the category of projected cones :    [ weightedlatticedef ]    1 .",

    "we first show that every smooth 2-complete toric variety @xmath0 with @xmath77 and @xmath653 arises from a bunch as in the assertion . from theorem  [ standard2maximal ]  ( ii )",

    "being two - dimensional , @xmath659 is generated by two vectors , say @xmath660 .",
    "now we make essential use of the fact that @xmath16 lives in a two - dimensional space : consider the intersection @xmath155 of all @xmath19 .",

    "consequently , @xmath660 is a regular cone in @xmath53 , and moreover , using remark  [ downstairsisochar ] , we may assume that @xmath662 and @xmath663 are the canonical base vectors of @xmath53 .",
    "we claim that the cone @xmath155 has at least one ray in common with @xmath659 . indeed",

    "this means @xmath674 with @xmath675 .",
    "so we arrive at the desired picture .",
    "note that the conditions @xmath83 and @xmath676 are due to property  [ standarddefi ]  ( ii ) .",
    "the fact that the toric variety @xmath0 associated to @xmath16 is projective is clear by proposition  [ completenesschar ] and corollary  [ ewaldcrit ] .",
    "moreover , corollary  [ fanocrit ] tells us that @xmath0 is fano if and only if the weighted sum @xmath677 lies in the relative interior of the cone @xmath487 .",
    "but this holds if and only if the condition stated in the assertion is valid .",
    "[ oda ] the simplest nonprojective complete simplicial fans @xmath1 live in @xmath50 and are of the following type : consider a prism @xmath678 over a 2-simplex such that @xmath679 lies in the relative interior of @xmath89 .",

    "moreover , by theorem  [ qcartier ] , the cone @xmath688 of semiample divisors is spanned by the class of the anticanonical divisor .",
    "the last example concerns the problem whether or not the betti numbers of a toric variety are determined by the combinatorial type of the defining fan .",
    "a first counterexample was given by mcconnell , see  @xcite .",
    "later eikelberg  @xcite gave the following simpler one :    [ eikelberg ] let @xmath678 be a prism over a 2-simplex such that @xmath679 lies in the relative interior of @xmath89 , and define @xmath1 to be the fan generated the cones over the facets of @xmath89 . as vertices of @xmath89 we take : @xmath689 eikelberg constructs a nonprojective fan @xmath690 from @xmath1 by moving the ray through @xmath691 into the ray through @xmath692 .",
    "the picture is the following ( the dotted diagonals indicate the edges of the convex hull over @xmath693 that do not define cones of @xmath690 ) :    what does this mean in terms of bunches ?",
    "first note that the bunches @xmath16 and @xmath226 corresponding to @xmath1 and @xmath690 contain 2-dimensional cones , because @xmath1 as well as @xmath690 have nonsimplicial cones .",
    "the loss of projectivity is reflected in terms of bunches as follows :    here we draw the intersection of @xmath16 and @xmath226 with a plane orthogonal to an inner vector of the ( strictly ) convex hulls @xmath694 and @xmath695 of the unions of the respective bunch cones .",
    "so the fat lines correspond to 2-dimensional bunch cones , whereas the shaded simplices represent 3-dimensional bunch cones .",
    "now , both fans @xmath1 and @xmath690 have the same combinatorial type . in terms of bunches , we see immediately that the associated toric varieties @xmath0 and @xmath696 have different betti numbers : the second betti number @xmath697 equals the dimension of @xmath698 .",
    "hence theorem  [ qcartier ] gives us @xmath699 .",
