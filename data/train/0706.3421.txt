    "low  mass x  ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are binary systems in which a compact object , either a neutron star or a black hole , accretes matter from a companion star that has a mass of typically less than 1  m@xmath7 .",
    "such systems are excellent test beds for a range of astrophysical questions and probe fundamental physics .",
    "theories , such as einstein s theory of general relativity , can be tested in the strong field regime by comparing the observed black hole and neutron star properties .",
    "the presence of an event horizon in the case of a black hole is such a prediction .",
    "observations of neutron star lmxbs can also help constrain the equation of state of matter at supra - nuclear densities encountered in the neutron star core .",
    "observationally , it was found that in general the luminosity of quiescent black hole lmxbs is lower than that of quiescent neutron star lmxbs ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , recent _ chandra _ and xmm_newton _ observations of several transient neutron star lmxbs in quiescence have shown that the luminosities of these sources span a much larger range extending to lower luminosities than previously thought ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the neutron star transient with the lowest quiescent x  ray luminosity is . using a 25 ks long observation of  with the _ chandra _ satellite , @xcite",
    "did not detect the source in quiescence down to a luminosity of 1.8@xmath8 erg s@xmath9 .",
    "this means that the neutron star luminosity in this source is comparable to that of several quiescent black hole lmxbs . for a recent introduction on , for a more detailed introduction on the difference in quiescent luminosity between neutron star and black hole lmxbs , and for an explanation why these transient neutron stars in quiescence can provide information on the neutron star equation of state",

    ", we present our analysis of a long _ chandra _ and a deep magellan observation of  obtained with the aim to detect the source or provide a stringent limit on the source flux and the source luminosity in quiescence .",
    "we have observed 1h  1905 + 000 with the back  illuminated s3 ccd  chip of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) detector on board the _ chandra _ satellite .",
    "a log of the observations is given in table  [ log ] .",
    "the data telemetry mode was set to _ very faint _ to allow for a thorough background subtraction .",
    "a ccd frame time of 3.04104 s has been used .",
    "we have reprocessed and analysed the data using the _ ciao 3.4 _ software developed by the chandra x  ray center using caldb version 3.3.0.1 , to benefit from the latest calibrations available early 2007 and to take full advantage of the _ very faint _ data mode . in our analysis we have selected events only if their energy falls in the 0.37 kev range in order to reduce the background contamination that occurs at high energies .",
    "the lower cut  off was chosen to avoid calibration uncertainties below 0.3 kev . since",
    "fluxes and luminosities are commonly provided in the 0.510 kev range , we extrapolate our 0.37 kev event rate to model fluxes over the 0.510 kev range in the remainder of this letter .",

    "the j2000.0 @xmath10 and @xmath11 position of that source was determined in @xcite to be @xmath120033 , @xmath1301@xmath140032 .",
    "we use this source to apply a boresight correction to each of the observations separately ( see table  [ log ] ) before combining them .",
    "in addition we applied a boresight correction of ( @xmath10 , @xmath11)=0090@xmath140013,-0208@xmath140014 to the final combined image such that the coordinates for cxou  j190834.1 + 001139 measured on the combined image are , within errors , consistent with the optical coordinates .",
    "the latter boresight correction accounts for the limited accuracy with which the source position can be determined in the individual observations .",

    "using this observation we do not detect the quiescent x  ray counterpart to this neutron star soft x  ray transient .",
    "the limit on the source flux depends on the assumed spectral model .",
    "for instance , a spectral model of an absorbed power law with index of 2 as observed for weak quiescent neutron star transients and quiescent black hole x - ray transients ( @xcite , @xcite ) , gives a 95% confidence upper limit on the 0.510 kev source flux of 2.0@xmath34 erg @xmath39 s@xmath9 . given the upper limit on the source distance of 10 kpc ( , @xcite ) this converts to a 0.510 kev luminosity limit of @xmath40 .",

    "note that some black hole sxts have not been detected in quiescence , and whereas the present upper limit to the luminosity in those cases is well above that derived for  one can not exclude that deeper observations will reveal a lower luminosity than that derived for .",
    "nevertheless , from present data the claim that there is evidence for a black hole event horizon from a lower quiescent luminosity in black holes than neutron stars ( e.g.  @xcite ) is unproven and at least does not hold universally .",
    "scaling of the observed quiescent luminosity with the eddington luminosity in order to try to normalize the neutron star and black hole systems to the same mass accretion rate is very uncertain .",
    "for instance , since an unknown amount of the transfered mass might be lost from the system in the form of a disk wind ( e.g.  @xcite ) , the relation between the mass transfer and mass accretion rate is not well constrained",
    ". this might be especially important for neutron star systems in quiescence if a propellor regime exists ( ) . on the other hand ,",
    "as shown for instance by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , black holes are producing more powerful jets observable in radio .",
    "matter could also be lost from these systems via these jets , the amount depends on the unknown composition of the jets . finally , it is unclear whether accretion in low ",
    "tranfer states proceeds via an advection dominated accretion flow ( e.g.  adaf ; @xcite ) or via a disk ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in deep optical sloan @xmath42band images obtained with the 6.5  m magellan telescope under excellent conditions ( seeing 04 ) we do not detect the optical counterpart to . for a distance of 10 kpc the magnitude upper limit of @xmath4325.3 converts into an upper limit on the absolute magnitude of @xmath449.6 ( as in @xcite we converted the observed outburst n@xmath45 from @xcite to a reddening a@xmath46 in the sloan @xmath42 band using the conversion factors given in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this limit implies that the companion star of  has a spectral type later than m5 or is a white dwarf as in ultra  compact x ",
    "ray binaries .",
    "it strengthens the identification of  as an ultra  compact x ",
    "ray binary ( @xcite ) .",
    "an absorbed thermal neutron star atmosphere spectral model for a distance of 10 kpc gives a limit to the effective temperature at the surface of the neutron star of 4.6@xmath32 k ( for a neutron star mass and radius of 1.4 m@xmath7 and 10 km , respectively and assuming a pure hydrogen non  magnetic atmosphere ) .",
    "for such a neutron star this implies an effective temperature of 3.5@xmath47 k at infinity .",
    "a factor in determining the limit on the source flux is the amount of interstellar extinction that is assumed .",
    "we have taken the conservative value for the hydrogen column density of @xmath48 from the results of @xcite who found @xmath49 .",
    "those authors found that the hydrogen column densities derived for several lmxbs from their spectral fits to einstein data agree with values found using rosat spectra .",
    "besides and related to the n@xmath45 , the bolometric correction is important in the conversion of the 0.510 kev band limit to a bolometric luminosity limit .",
    "e.g.  from the upper limit on the effective temperature of a neutron star atmosphere an upper limit to the bolometric luminosity of @xmath50 erg s@xmath9 is determined implying a bolometric correction of @xmath2745 . for a power law spectral model with index 2 ,",
    "the bolometric correction would be @xmath273 ( here we have taken the 0.01100 kev luminosity as a good measure of the bolometric luminosity ) . in this",
    "we again have taken @xmath51 .",
    "the new deep limit on the quiescent thermal x  ray emission of  implies that the neutron star must cool faster than possible with modified urca processes even for time averaged mass accretion rates as low as 10@xmath52 m@xmath7 year@xmath9 ( @xcite ) , unless the neutron star core is not in a steady state .",
    "this would mean that  had been in quiescence prior to the @xmath5310 year long outburst for @xmath2710 thousand years since the core reaches steady state on such timescales ( @xcite , ) .",
    "on the other hand , here again one should keep in mind that the relation between the mass transfer and mass accretion rate is not well known especially for quiescent systems .",
    "so , it is possible that the time averaged mass transfer rate is larger than 10@xmath52 m@xmath7 year@xmath9 whereas the mass accretion rate onto the neutron star is lower than this .",
