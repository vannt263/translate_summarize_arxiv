    "over the past century , a standard cosmological model has emerged : with relatively few parameters , the model describes the evolution of the universe and astronomical observations on scales ranging from a few to thousands of megaparsecs . in this model",
    "the universe is spatially flat , homogeneous and isotropic on large scales , composed of radiation , ordinary matter ( electrons , protons , neutrons and neutrinos ) , non - baryonic cold dark matter , and dark energy .",
    "galaxies and large - scale structure grew gravitationally from tiny , nearly scale - invariant adiabatic gaussian fluctuations . the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( _ wmap  _ ) data offer a demanding quantitative test of this model .    the _ wmap _ data are powerful because they result from a mission that was carefully designed to limit systematic measurement errors @xcite . a critical element of this design includes differential measurements of the full sky with a complex sky scan pattern . the nearly uncorrelated noise between pairs of pixels , the accurate in - flight determination of the beam patterns @xcite , and the well - understood properties of the radiometers @xcite are invaluable for this analysis .",
    "our basic approach in this analysis is to begin by identifying the simplest model that fits the _ wmap  _ data and determine the best fit parameters for this model using _",
    "wmap  _ data only without the use of any significant priors on parameter values .",
    "we then compare the predictions of this model to other data sets and find that the model is basically consistent with these data sets .",
    "we then fit to combinations of the _ wmap  _ data and other astronomical data sets and find the best fit global model . finally , we place constraints on alternatives to this model .",
    "we begin by outlining our methodology (  2 ) . @xcite",
    "describes the details of the approach used here to compare theoretical predictions of cosmological models to data . in  3 , we fit a simple , six parameter @xmath22cdm model to the _ wmap  _ data - set ( temperature - temperature and temperature - polarization angular power spectra ) . in ",
    "4 we show that this simple model provides an acceptable fit not only to the _ wmap  _ data , but also to a host of astronomical data .",
    "we use the comparison with these other datasets to test the validity of the model rather than further constrain the model parameters . in  5 , we include large scale structure data from the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , @xcite ) and lyman @xmath7 forest data to perform a joint likelihood analysis for the cosmological parameters .",
    "we find that the data favors a slowly varying spectral index .",
    "this seven parameter model is our best fit to the full data set . in  6 , we relax some of the minimal assumptions of the model by adding extra parameters to the model .",
    "we examine non - flat models , dark energy models in which the properties of the dark energy are parameterized by an effective equation of state , and models with gravity waves . by adding extra parameters we introduce degenerate sets of models consistent with the _ wmap  _ data alone .",
    "we lift these degeneracies by including additional microwave background data - sets ( cbi , acbar ) and observations of large - scale structure .",
    "we use these combined data sets to place strong limits on the geometry of the universe , the neutrino mass , the energy density in gravity waves , and the properties of the dark energy . in  7 , we note an intriguing discrepancy between the standard model and the _",
    "wmap  _ data on the largest angular scales and speculate on its origin . in  8 , we conclude and present parameters for our best fit model .",
    "the basic approach of this paper is to find the simplest model consistent with cosmological data .",
    "we begin by fitting a simple six parameter model first to the _ wmap  _ data and then to other cosmological data sets .",
    "we then consider more complex cosmological models and evaluate whether they are a better description of the cosmological data . since @xcite found no evidence for non - gaussianity in the _ wmap  _ data , we assume the primordial fluctuations are gaussian random phase throughout this paper . for each model studied in the paper ,",
    "we use a monte carlo markov chain to explore the likelihood surface .",
    "we assume flat priors in our basic parameters , impose positivity constraints on the matter and baryon density ( these limits lie at such low likelihood that they are unimportant for the models .",
    "we assume a flat prior in @xmath23 , the optical depth , but bound @xmath24 .",
    "this prior has little effect on the fits but keeps the markov chain out of unphysical regions of parameter space . for each model , we determine the best fit parameters from the peak of the n - dimensional likelihood surface .",
    "for each parameter in the model we also compute its one dimensional likelihood function by marginalizing over all other parameters ; we then quote the ( 1-dimensional ) expectation value as our best estimate for the parameter : @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes a point in the n - dimensional parameter space ( in our application these are points sets of cosmological parameters in the output of the markov chain ) , @xmath27 denotes the likelihood ( in our application the `` weight '' given by the chain to each point ) .",
    "the _ wmap  _ temperature ( tt ) angular power spectrum and the _ wmap  _ temperature - polarization ( te ) angular power spectrum are our core data sets for the likelihood analysis . @xcite and @xcite",
    "describe how to obtain the temperature and temperature - polarization angular power spectra respectively from the maps .",
    "@xcite describes our basic methodology for evaluating the likelihood functions using a monte carlo markov chain algorithm and for including data - sets other than _ wmap  _ in our analysis .",
    "in addition to _",
    "wmap  _ data we use recent results from the cbi @xcite and acbar @xcite experiments .",
    "we also use the 2dfgrs  measurements of the power spectrum @xcite and the bias parameter @xcite , measurements of the lyman @xmath7 power spectrum @xcite , supernova ia measurements of the angular diameter distance relation @xcite , and the hubble space telescope key project measurements of the local expansion rate of the universe @xcite .",
    "we begin by considering a basic cosmological model : a flat universe with radiation , baryons , cold dark matter and cosmological constant , and a power - law power spectrum of adiabatic primordial fluctuations . as we will see , this model does a remarkably good job of describing _",
    "wmap  _ tt and te power spectra with only six parameters : the hubble constant @xmath28 ( in units of 100 km / s / mpc ) , the physical matter and baryon densities @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the optical depth to the decoupling surface , @xmath23 , the scalar spectral index @xmath12 and @xmath31 , the normalization parameter in the cmbfast code version 4.1 with option unnorm .",
    "@xcite discusses the relationship between @xmath31 and the amplitude of curvature fluctuations at horizon crossing , @xmath32 . in  4 ,",
    "we show that this model is also in acceptable agreement with a wide range of astronomical data .",
    "this simple model provides an acceptable fit to both the _ wmap  _ tt and te data ( see figure [ fig : clfit ] and [ fig : te_fit ] ) .",
    "the reduced and @xmath33 is number of data minus the number of parameters .",

    "@xmath35 for the full fit is 1.066 for 1342 degrees of freedom , which has a probability of @xmath36% . for the tt data alone , @xmath37 , which for 893 degrees of freedom has a probability of 3% .",
    "most of the excess @xmath35 is due to the inability of the model to fit sharp features in the power spectrum near @xmath38 , the first tt peak and at @xmath39 . in figure",
    "[ fig : res_fit ] we show the contribution to @xmath35 per multipole .",
    "the overall excess variance is likely due to our not including several effects , each contributing roughly @xmath40 to our power spectrum covariance near the first peak and trough : gravitational lensing of the cmb @xcite , the spatial variations in the effective beam of the _ wmap  _ experiment due to variations in our scan orientation between the ecliptic pole and plane regions @xcite , and non - gaussianity in the noise maps due to the @xmath41 striping .",
    "including these effects would increase our estimate of the power spectrum uncertainties and improve our estimate of @xmath35 .",
    "our next data release will include the corrections and errors associated with the beam asymmetries .",
    "the features in the measured power spectrum could be due to underlying features in the primordial power spectrum ( see  5 of @xcite ) , but we do not yet attach cosmological significance to them .",

    "the values in the third column are the values at the peak of the likelihood function .",
    "since we are projecting a high dimensional likelihood function , the peak of the likelihood is not the same as the expectation value of a parameter .",
    "most of the basic parameters are remarkably well determined within the context of this model .",
    "our most significant parameter degeneracy ( see figure [ fig : ns ] ) is a degeneracy between @xmath12 and @xmath23 .",
    "the te data favors @xmath51 @xcite ; on the other hand , the low value of the quadrupole ( see figure [ fig : clfit ] and  [ sec : discrepancy ] ) and the relatively low amplitude of fluctuations for @xmath52 disfavors high @xmath23 as reionization produces additional large scale anisotropies . because of the combination of these two effects , the likelihood surface is quite flat at its peak : the likelihood changes by only @xmath53 as @xmath23 changes from @xmath54 .",
    "this particular shape depends upon the assumed form of the power spectrum : in  [ sec : running ] , we show that models with a scale - dependent spectral index have a narrower likelihood function that is more centered around @xmath55 .",
    "since the _ wmap  _ data allows us to accurately determine many of the basic cosmological parameters , we can now infer a number of important derived quantities to very high accuracy ; we do this by computing these quantities for each model in the mcmc and use the chain to determine their expectation values and uncertainties .",

    "we also consider if our determination of the reionization redshift is consistent with the prediction for structure formation in our best fit universe and with recent models of reionization . in",
    " 5 and 6 , we add some of these data sets to the _ wmap  _ data to better constrain parameters and cosmological models .",
    "cmb observations do not directly measure the local expansion rate of the universe rather they measure the conformal distance to the decoupling surface and the matter - radiation ratio through the amplitude of the early integrated sachs wolfe ( isw ) contribution relative to the height of the first peak . for our power law @xmath22cdm model ,",
    "this is enough information to `` predict '' the local expansion rate .",
    "thus , local hubble constant measurements are an important test of our basic model .",
    "the hubble key project @xcite has carried out an extensive program of using cepheids to calibrate several different secondary distance indicators ( type ia supernovae , tully - fisher , type ii supernovae , and surface brightness fluctuations ) . with a distance modulus of @xmath77 for the lmc ,",
    "their combined estimate for the hubble constant is @xmath78  km / s / mpc .",
    "the agreement between the hst key project value and our value , @xmath79 , is striking , given that the two methods rely on different observables , different underlying physics , and different model assumptions .    as we will show in  6 , models with equation of state for the dark energy very different from a cosmological constant ( i.e. , @xmath80 ) only fit the _ wmap  _ data if the hubble constant is much smaller than the hubble key project value .",
    "an independent determination of the hubble constant that makes different assumptions than the traditional distance ladder can be obtained by combining sunyaev - zeldovich and x - ray flux measurements of clusters of galaxies , under the assumption of sphericity for the density and temperature profile of clusters .",
    "this method is sensitive to the hubble constant at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath81 ) , rather than in the nearby universe .",

    "the overall amplitude of fluctuations on large - scale structure scales has been recently determined from weak lensing surveys , clusters number counts and peculiar velocities from galaxy surveys .",

    "weak lensing directly probes the amplitude of mass fluctuations along the line of sight to the background galaxies . once the redshift distribution of the background galaxies is known , this technique directly probes gravitational potential fluctuations , and therefore can be easily compared with our cmb model predictions for the amplitude of dark matter fluctuations .",
    "several groups have reported weak shear measurements within the past year ( see table [ tab : a ] and @xcite for recent review ) : while there is significant scatter in the reported amplitude , the best fit model to the _ wmap  _ data lies in the middle of the reported range . as these shear measurements continue to improve",
