    "in this paper we continue the investigation of single leptoquark ( lq ) production with emission of a hard photon in electron - proton collisions , @xmath2 in @xcite we found that a radiative amplitude zero ( raz ) effect is present for some types of leptoquarks .",
    "of particular interest is the case of vector leptoquarks which have an exact radiative amplitude zero only in the case of a yang - mills structure of coupling to the photon . in this paper",
    "we develop the application of this effect to the measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the vector leptoquark .",
    "we present the numerical analysis for the case of a possible lep+lhc experiment @xcite .. ]",
    "the electromagnetic interaction of vector leptoquarks is described by the following lagrangian : @xmath3 \\nonumber \\\\      & - & ( eq)^2[a^2(\\phi^+_\\mu\\phi^\\mu)-(a^\\mu\\phi^+_\\mu)(a^\\nu\\phi_\\nu ) ] .",
    "\\label{eq : vlq - lagr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath4 , @xmath5 ; @xmath6 denotes the vector leptoquark ; @xmath7 is the elementary electric charge ; @xmath8 is the charge of the leptoquark in units of @xmath7 .",
    "this lagrangian contains a free dimensionless parameter @xmath1 , the _ anomalous magnetic moment _ of the leptoquark .",
    "the value @xmath9 corresponds to the yang - mills structure of the interaction , while @xmath10 corresponds to _",
    "minimal coupling_. the measurement of this parameter could help us in the understanding of the nature of this new massive vector boson .",
    "a value of @xmath9 would indicate that the vector leptoquark belongs to the family of gauge bosons .",
    "such particles were introduced in grand unified theories ( gut ) ( see the corresponding references in @xcite ) . in these models vector leptoquarks",
    "are represented by some components of a unified gauge field that provides the interaction of all matter fields , while the other components represent the known gauge bosons , i.e. photons , gluons , @xmath11 and @xmath12 bosons .",
    "therefore in these theories the yang - mills structure of the lq - photon vertex is defined by the selfinteraction of the unified gauge field .",
    "on the other hand if it were found that @xmath10 , then we should consider this leptoquark to be a new charged matter field rather than a gauge field . in this case the minimal coupling to the electromagnetic field is also consistent with the principle of local gauge invariance similarly to the electromagnetic interaction of leptons and quarks .",
    "however , in this case there arises a serious problem of how to ensure the unitarity and renormalizability of the theory .",
    "thus from a theoretical point of view the deviation from the yang - mills structure is a most interesting effect and we organize our numerical analysis in such a way as to study its possible manifistations .",
    "we can conclude that the measurement of the leptoquark magnetic moment will arise as a fundamental problem when these massive vector bosons are discovered . in the literature",
    "the possible existence of vector leptoquarks with relatively small masses ( hundreds of gev ) is under discussion .",
    "searches for leptoquarks have been carried out at hera and lower limits on their masses have been established at the level @xmath13 gev , depending on the leptoquark type @xcite .",
    "let us note that some higher limits have been derived by indirect methods from low energy experiments @xcite , being stronger for the vector leptoquarks . in @xcite",
    "the minimal coupling was investigated in leptoquark pair production in @xmath14 collisions . in @xcite",
    "the lagrangian with anomalous magnetic moment ( and with anomalous quadrupole electric moment ) was considered in connection with probing these anomalous couplings in @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 collisions . in the present paper",
    "we analyse the potential of conceivable lep+lhc experiments for the measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment from reactions with single leptoquark production associated with the emission of a hard photon .",
    "the hard subprocess underlying reaction ( [ eq : ep - gammlqx ] ) is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a constituent quark of the proton .",
    "we consider the case when the leptoquark interacts only with quarks of the first generation , i.e. @xmath19 .    from a phenomenological point of view the most general lagrangian for fermion - lq vertices was proposed in @xcite where leptoquarks of all possible quantum numbers were discussed .",
    "below we use the notation introduced for leptoquarks in @xcite ( see also the detailed table of leptoquark quantum numbers in @xcite ) .",
    "in @xcite we have obtained the analytical formulas for the squared matrix element of hard subprocess ( [ eq : eq - gammlq ] ) leptoquarks are greater by a factor of two . ] : @xmath20 ,                                                \\label{eq : vlq - a2}\\ ] ]    @xmath21 here @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the quark , electron and positron charges , respectively , in units of @xmath7 ; @xmath24 .",
    "we also use normalized dimensionless mandelstam variables ( @xmath25 is the leptoquark mass ) : @xmath26    we see that the first two terms in ( [ eq : vlq - a2 ] ) vanish at some value of @xmath27 and @xmath28 due to the factor @xmath29 .",
    "this means in particular that for @xmath30 ( yang - mills case ) there is no photon radiation in some direction depending on the electric charge of the leptoquark ( _ radiative amplitude zero  raz _ effect ) .",
    "in @xcite we have investigated the raz effect in detail and arrived at some conclusions about the possibility of observing the raz effect at hera and lep+lhc and to use this effect for the determination of quantum numbers of the discovered leptoquarks .",
    "the fact that the @xmath31 term has no raz factor @xmath29 makes the cross section sensitive to the value of the leptoquark anomalous magnetic moment . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdifvraz ] we show a typical angular distribution with a clear dependence on @xmath1 in the raz region . in the next section we analyse numerically the possibility to get an upper bound on the value of the anomalous magnetic moment from reaction ( [ eq : ep - gammlqx ] ) .",
    "we show that the raz effect , if it is present , enables one to establish much stronger upper bounds on the value of @xmath1 then in the cases without raz .",
    "we have calculated the contributions of separate ( quark ) constituents to the integrated cross sections by convoluting the differential cross sections of the hard subprocesses with the corresponding parton distribution functions : @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the cross section of the corresponding subprocess ( [ eq : eq - gammlq ] ) ; @xmath34 is the squared cms energy of the electron - proton system ; the squared cms energy of the hard subprocess is @xmath35 ; the quark distribution function is denoted by @xmath36 and the 4-momentum transfer scale is taken to be @xmath37 .",
    "we denote the photon emission angle by @xmath38 ; the direction @xmath39 is along the proton beam .",
    "the function @xmath40 introduces the necessary kinematical cuts .",
    "the process under discussion is infrared divergent , therefore we have to introduce a cut @xmath41 ; for our numerical analysis we use @xmath42 gev .",
    "also we introduce a cut on the photon emission angle , @xmath43 , to exclude the unobservable forward and backward cones and to ensure the optimal conditions for probing @xmath1 ( see next section ) . as the lower bound @xmath44 we use values which will also ensure the optimal conditions for probing @xmath1 .    for our calculations , both analytical for the squared matrix elements and numerical for the integrands including the convolution with parton distributions and @xmath45 , we have used the comphep package @xcite .",
    "as monte carlo integrator and event generator we have used the bases / spring package @xcite .",
    "for the parton densities we used the parametrizations cteq2p @xcite and mrs - a @xcite which take account of recent hera data .",
    "both parametrizations gave the same results within calculation errors .",
    "the numerical analysis of the corresponding cross sections is given for the lep+lhc collider with @xmath46 gev , electron beam energy of @xmath47 gev and an integrated luminosity of @xmath48 .",
    "of course in reality the leptoquarks decay into two fermions , a lepton and a quark .",
    "so we have to take account of complete sets of diagrams , including the standard model background consisting of deep inelastic scattering associated with hard photon emission .",
    "in @xcite we have calculated all contributions and found that the standard model background was less than 1% of the signal .",
    "this result was obtained for some set of kinematical cuts to reduce the standard model background ; the most effective cut was the cut on the invariant mass of the lepton - quark system around the leptoquark mass .",
    "in this section we analyse numerically the possibility of getting an upper bound on @xmath1 from experiment ( [ eq : ep - gammlqx ] ) .",
    "one of the general restrictions on the lq - fermion interaction is the chirality of the lepton ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore we consider only either coupling with left - handed leptons or with right - handed ones . in both cases",
    "we have used an electroweak value for this constant , @xmath49 . for other values of @xmath50 numerical estimates",
    "can be obtained by rescaling our results from the figures ( the cross sections have @xmath51 as a factor ) . as to leptoquark masses we investigated the range @xmath52 .",
    "let us consider as a criterion for the value @xmath53 to be detectable the condition that the number of events in this case has to be different from those of the yang - mills case with @xmath54 .",
    "therefore the following relation must be satatisfied : @xmath55 . here",
    "@xmath56 is the number of events corresponding to cross section ( [ eq : i - sigma - gammlq ] ) with luminosity @xmath48 .",
    "it is clear that the cross section is a quadratic function of @xmath1 .",
    "we found from our numerical analysis that the minimum of this function lies near the yang - mills value @xmath9 and in the region under consideration its exact position does not stronlgly depend on the leptoquark mass .",
    "therefore we consider only the positive branch of @xmath1 .",
    "the analysis for negative values gives practically the same results as for positive values : the difference is no more than 20% .",
    "thus , we should keep in mind that if a deviation from the yang - mills cross section is observed in the experiment it will show evidence only for an absolute value of @xmath1 but will not allow us to determine its sign .",
    "we denote by @xmath57 the lowest positive value of @xmath1 for which the above criterion is satisfied .",
    "it is clear that larger values of @xmath57 mean a lower sensitivity of the experiment to @xmath1 ; we have therefore chosen @xmath57 as a representative characteristic of our analysis .",
    "as we already noted the raz effect should increase the sensitivity to @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , we are going to observe the contribution of the terms proportional to @xmath1 and to @xmath31 in ( [ eq : vlq - a2 ] ) with a value of @xmath1 as small as possible .",
    "so regions , where the contribution of the yang - mills term ( the first term in ( [ eq : vlq - a2 ] ) ) is smaller , are more promising for our analysis .",
    "it is clear that the region near the raz , where @xmath58 , has to be very sensitive to the value of @xmath1 .",
    "we conclude that the strongest bound on the value of @xmath1 can be obtained for leptoquarks with raz , i.e. for @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the left - hand sector and for @xmath59 and @xmath61 in the right - hand sector . in fig .",
    "[ fig : k2theta ] we show a typical dependence of parameter @xmath57 on the cut over the photon emission angle in the case of raz .",
    "we see from these figures that an optimal cut could be given by @xmath62    the term with the anomalous magnetic moment in lagrangian ( [ eq : vlq - lagr ] ) contains derivatives of the electromagnetic field . therefore the contribution of the @xmath1 terms to the cross section is smaller for lower energies of the emitted photon .",
    "this point is important for our analysis because the region near the threshold where the quasi - resonant peak lies is shown , with a sharp quasi - resonant peak near the threshold @xmath63 even with the cut @xmath64 gev . ]",
    "turns out to be insensitive to @xmath1 .",
    "so to ensure a maximal sensitivity to @xmath1 we have to cut off the threshold region .",
    "on the other hand , the introduction of too large a cut on @xmath65 could remove all events .",
    "the implication is that we have to find the optimal value of @xmath44 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : d2xmin ] we show @xmath57 as a function of @xmath44 for three values of the leptoquark mass and with the angular cuts ( [ eq : thet-10 - 90 ] ) applied .",
    "the dependence of @xmath57 for large values of @xmath44 is rather smooth .",
    "we found that the optimal values for this cut could be parametrized by the following empirical formula @xmath66    our final results are represented on the fig .",
    "[ fig : d2 m ] where the dependence of the @xmath57 parameter is given as a function of the leptoquark mass , on the left - hand side in the raz case and on the right - hand side for other leptoquarks .",
    "points above the curves can be measured with @xmath54 .",
    "here we have used the cuts ( [ eq : thet-10 - 90 ] ) and ( [ eq : xopt ] ) . in table",
    "[ tab : kapupmassraz ] we give the upper bounds on the leptoquark masses for two values of the anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath10 and @xmath67 in the raz cases . for lower masses",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath1 can be measured with @xmath54 .",
    "let us stress again that only an absolute value of @xmath1 is discussed here .",
    "in this paper we have carried out the raz analysis only for reactions with electron decay modes of the leptoquarks .",
    "so only some isospin components of the leptoquarks were considered .",
    "the analysis for the complementary isospin components has to be based on reactions with neutrino decay modes .",
    "these channels could be added also in the total statistics to establish stronger bounds on @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding analysis will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the proposed analysis of cross sections of vector leptoquark production in @xmath0 collisions shows a possibility to measure the leptoquark anomalous magnetic moment @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding experiments will be more sensitive for those leptoquarks which reveal the raz effect .",
    "the value @xmath10 ( minimal coupling ) can be measured at lep+lhc up to @xmath68 for @xmath69 , and up to @xmath70 for @xmath71 and @xmath61 types of leptoquarks . in the case of @xmath60 and @xmath61 leptoquarks ,",
    "the positron - proton channel is more sensitive than the electron - proton channel .",
    "the anomalous magnetic moment of leptoquarks for which there is no raz effect can be measured only on the level of several units or even @xmath72 .",
