    "recent advances in producing synthetic spin - orbit coupling fields in cold atoms , both bosonic @xcite and fermionic , @xcite opened a new field of research in cold matter physics reviewed in refs .",
    "spin - orbit coupling of the rashba and dresselhaus forms , as well as effective magnetic fields leading to the zeeman - like splitting for the corresponding pseudospin , can be designed there by optical means . in these systems",
    "the pseudospin is formed by coupling hyperfine atomic levels with highly coherent resonant laser radiation . since this",
    "coupling strongly depends on the detuning of the laser frequency from the resonance , the movement of an atom also modifies its interaction with light via the doppler shift linear in the atom velocity .",
    "this effect is seen as the effective spin - orbit coupling .",
    "there are at least two advantages of the synthetic spin - orbit couplings over those observed in solids @xcite .",
    "first , the effect of the coupling on cold atoms can be considerably stronger than that on electrons in semiconductors .",
    "second , it may be designed for a particular purpose , and can be switched on and off as required .",
    "the relative strength of the coupling can make possible observation of new macroscopically ordered phases ( see e.g. @xcite ) , topological states ( e.g. @xcite ) , and nontrivial spin dynamics @xcite . flexibility in designing the fields suggests new applications of cold atoms in dynamical systems , for example , developing of new quantum measurement techniques .",
    "below we use this coupling in order to simulate a measurement on spin precessing in an external magnetic field , a fundamental problem in many branches of physics .",
    "conversely , spin - orbit coupling can be seen as a means of controlling the motion of atoms . in particular",
    ", we will explore the measurement s ability to manipulate coherent motion of atoms in a bose - einstein condensate with spin - orbit coupling , where the effect of the coupling is enhanced by a large number of participating bosons in the same quantum state .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sections ii and iii",
    "we introduce coupled spin - orbit dynamics and show that it can serve as a quantum meter for the ( pseudo)spin degrees of freedom , with the center of mass of the atom playing the role of a von neumann pointer . in sec .",
    "iv we study decoherence produced on the spin by the measurement . in sec .",
    "v we use simple results from the measurement theory in order to describe the spacial distribution of the atomic cloud and identify zeno , ergodic , and intermediate regimes of the measurement . in section vi we will suggest possible experimental implementations .",
    "brief conclusions are given in sec .",
    "we begin with the rashba hamiltonian for an atom of mass @xmath0 moving in one dimension @xcite in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the momentum , @xmath5 is the larmor frequency , @xmath6 is the spin - orbit velocity , and @xmath7 are the pauli matrices . the spin - orbit coupling term in eq .",
    "results in breaking the galilean invariance @xcite , so that the system can have a non - zero velocity even for a zero total momentum .",
    "the system has a characteristic length , the distance @xmath8 which an atom travels at @xmath6 in @xmath9 of the larmor period . with the help of @xmath10",
    "we define the dimensionless variables @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , which we will use below unless stated otherwise .",
    "the wavefunction of an atom with a pseudo - spin 1/2 is a two - component spinor @xmath15 which , in the new variables , satisfies the schrdinger equation : @xmath16 { \\bm \\psi}(x , t).\\ ] ] we assume that the spin - orbit coupling is activated at @xmath17 , when the center of mass of the atom is described by a wave packet @xmath18 and its spin is in an initial pure state @xmath19}$ ] . with no loss of generality we consider an atom initially at rest , so that @xmath20 is peaked around @xmath21 .",
    "( an additional constant field due to the atom s nonzero momentum can be absorbed in @xmath22 . ) finally , we choose @xmath22 to lie in the @xmath23-plane making an angle @xmath24 with the @xmath25-axis , @xmath26 .",
    "the subsequent dynamics is not trivial : for each momentum @xmath27 , the spin orbit coupling adds an extra magnetic field , proportional to @xmath27 , along the @xmath25-axis , so that the resultant strength of the field in which the spin precesses , is uncertain .",
    "the  anomalous ",
    "spin - dependent contribution to the atom s velocity , @xmath28 $ ] , is proportional to the @xmath25-component of the spin , so the atom s translational motion is also complicated .",

    "its matrix elements are @xmath33 where @xmath34",
    "equivalently , @xmath15 can be written as a convolution in the coordinate space , @xmath35 where the wave packet @xmath36 describes the motion of the atom without spin - orbit coupling , and the sub - states @xmath37 are given by @xmath38 } dp.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] both representations , ( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) have advantages , which we will explore below .",
    "we begin by revisiting classical measurements . consider a classical system with coordinate @xmath39 and momentum @xmath40 , coupled to a pointer , whose coordinate and momentum are @xmath41 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "for the full hamiltonian we write @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the system s hamiltonian , and @xmath44 is some dynamical variable of interest @xcite . setting the pointer to zero , @xmath45 , and giving it an initial momentum , @xmath46",
    ", we easily find @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the trajectory of a system governed by the modified hamiltonian @xmath49 .",
    "thus , by reading the final pointer position , @xmath50 , we also measure the time average @xmath51 along a trajectory which is perturbed by the meter , unless the pointer is at rest , @xmath52 .",
    "equation ( [ 4 ] ) is a quantum version of eq.([2 ] ) , with the @xmath25-component of the spin , @xmath53 playing the role of the measured variable , the center of mass of the atom with the position @xmath41 playing the role of the pointer , and the coupling to the magnetic field - the role of @xmath54 .",
    "we have , therefore , a quantum measurement which we will analyze in detail .",
    "the connection with the classical measurement above becomes even more evident if we slice the time interval into @xmath55 subintervals of length @xmath56 , send @xmath55 to infinity , and use the trotter formula to factorize @xmath57\\epsilon\\}=\\exp\\{-i(\\mathbf{n}\\cdot \\bm{\\sigma})\\epsilon\\}\\exp(-ip\\sigma_z\\epsilon)$ ] . in this way , we obtain for the spin a set of virtual feynman paths taking the values @xmath58 , @xmath59 at each discrete time , and define for each path an evolution operator @xmath60 \\times   \\\\ & & \\hspace{-1cm}|s_{k+1}\\ra\\la s_{k+1}|\\exp[-i(\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\bm{\\sigma})\\epsilon]|s_{k}\\ra\\times \\ldots \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{0.5cm}\\la s_2|\\exp[-i(\\mathbf{n}\\cdot \\bm{\\sigma})\\epsilon]|s_{1}\\ra\\la s_1| \\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\exp\\left[-ip\\sum_{k=1}^k s_k\\epsilon\\right ] \\hat{\\mathcal{u}}(t,\\rm path ) .",

    "the resulting time average of @xmath61 along a given path @xmath63 is : @xmath64\\ra_t = t^{-1}\\lim_{k\\to \\infty } \\sum_{k=1}^k s_k\\epsilon \\equiv t^{-1}\\int_0^t s(t')dt'.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] interchanging integration over @xmath27 with summation over the paths , we can rewrite eq.([8 ] ) as a sum over only such evolutions for which the time average of @xmath61 equals @xmath65 in the form : @xmath66},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 , acting on the spin s degrees of freedom , is defined in eq.([10a ] ) .",
    "this is a quantum analog of eq.([3 ] ) - the atom arrives at a location @xmath41 provided the time average of @xmath61 is equal to @xmath65 .",
    "there are , however , important differences .",
    "first , with many virtual paths involved , @xmath68 is a distributed quantity , whose value may lie between @xmath69 ( the spin spends all the time in the @xmath70 state ) and @xmath71 ( the spin spends all the time in the @xmath72 state ) .",
    "second , we can only determine @xmath68 to a finite accuracy .",
    "if @xmath73 in eq.([7 ] ) is peaked around @xmath74 with the width @xmath75 , by finding the particle in point @xmath41 one can ascertain the value of @xmath68 with an error @xmath76 .",
    "finally , even though the mean momentum of the atom remains zero at all times , a narrow @xmath77 requires a spread of @xmath27 s around @xmath21 , and additional fields produced by these non - zero momenta perturb the spin s motion .",
    "the perturbation is greater for more accurate measurements .",
    "it is likely to result in decoherence of the initially pure spin state @xmath19}$ ] , which will discuss next .",
    "taking the trace of the pure state @xmath78 over the atom s position @xmath41 , we find spin s reduced density matrix @xmath79 to be given by an incoherent sum , @xmath80 plus a spin - orbit field induced by @xmath27 ( cf",
    "@xcite ) . from ( [ 6 ] )",
    "we see that the matrix elements of @xmath81 contain terms which oscillate as functions of @xmath27 ever more rapidly as the time increases . for a smooth wave packet , such as a gaussian one , @xmath82",
    "the integrals involving these oscillatory terms will vanish as @xmath83 , leaving the spin in a steady state @xmath84 which , in general , depends on @xmath75 and @xmath19}$ ] . the same applies to the averages of spin components @xmath85 $ ] , which will reach steady values at long times .",

    "the reason for this behavior , partially illustrated in fig.[fig : fig1 ] , can be seen as follows .",

    "@xmath106 all the fields are directed along the @xmath25-axis , there is no spin precession , and @xmath61 is conserved .",

    "the decoherence seen in @xmath109 is approximately gaussian , as indicated by the dashed line . as expected from eq.([12 ] ) for a large @xmath110 , we obtain @xmath111 here we use physical units for length and time . ]",
    "to study spatial distribution of the atomic cloud we begin by noting from eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) that the mean anomalous velocity of the atom is given by @xmath112}=\\overline{\\sigma}_{z}(t)$ ] , so that its mean position at a time @xmath113 is @xmath114 this is another quantum analog of the classical equation ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "it shows that once the @xmath25-component of the spin settles into its stationary value ( see fig.[fig : fig1 ] ) , the center of mass of the atomic cloud @xmath115 will move with a constant velocity .",
    "equation ( [ 13 ] ) does not , however , tell us what the cloud looks like . to learn more about the cloud s shape we return to the convolution formula ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "it involves two known quantities : the wave packet @xmath73 describing the atom _ as it would be without the so interaction _ , and , via eq.([10 ] ) , the amplitude distribution of @xmath68 for a spin precessing in the magnetic field @xmath116 , also _ without the so interaction_. general properties of such distributions are known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which simplifies our analysis . in the following",
    "we will assume that the mass of the atom is sufficiently large to neglect the spreading of the wave packet ( a justification will be given in sect .",
    "vi below ) .",
    "thus , we have @xmath117^{1/4}\\exp(-x^2/(\\delta x)^2).\\q\\ ] ] the advantage of applying eq.([7 ] ) is that we effectively look at the details of the green s function ( [ 8 ] ) through a sort of a microscope with a resolution @xmath75 .",

    "the larger is @xmath75 is , the less information about the distribution of @xmath68 we obtain .",

    "general properties of such amplitudes , as are mentioned above , are known in quantum measurement theory @xcite .",
    "the diagonal terms , @xmath127 , have @xmath128-singularities responsible for the zeno effect .",
    "the effect arises if , for a given @xmath113 , the error with which one measures a time average , tends to zero .",
    "it locks the measured system in the eigenstates of the measured quantity , in our case , @xmath61 .    for a time that is long compared to the period of the larmor precession , that is for @xmath129 , all @xmath130 are highly oscillatory , with stationary regions near @xmath131 , where @xmath132^t ,     are the spin states polarized along and against the effective magnetic field @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the stationary points account for the ergodic property of quantum motion @xcite . if the accuracy @xmath75 is kept finite , while the measurement time increases , the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath133 overcomes the restrictions imposed by the meter .",
    "the spin s density matrix becomes diagonal in the eigenbasis of @xmath134 , and the system explores its hilbert space in such a way that the time average of a variable tends to its average in the instantaneous von neumann measurement made on this diagonal mixed state @xcite .    to prove the above , for @xmath129 we evaluate the integrals in ( [ 15 ] ) by the saddle point method , which yields @xmath135 ,   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\xi_{12}(x , t)=i\\sqrt{1/2\\pi\\beta}(t^2-x^2)^{-1/4 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad\\times \\sin[\\beta(t^2-x^2)^{1/2}+\\pi/4].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is seen that @xmath130 in eq.([14 ] ) have stationary points at @xmath136    in our case , the accuracy of measuring @xmath68 , @xmath137 changes with time , but so do the amplitude distributions @xmath138 , and one can not say _ apriori _ whether the improvement in the accuracy is rapid enough to lock the system in the zeno effect , or whether it would lead to the ergodic regime involving stationary points of the propagator described above .",
    "next we will show that both situations are possible , depending on the ratio between the width of the wave packet @xmath77 , and the characteristic distance @xmath10 .",
    "thus , for a narrow initial wavepacket , @xmath139 , and @xmath129 from ( [ 12 ] ) we have @xmath140 this is the zeno effect - at long times the spin is locked in its initial state @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the time average @xmath68 also tends to unity , with only the @xmath128-term in the first of eqs.([15 ] ) contributing to @xmath15 in eq.([7 ] ) . as a result , the initial wave packet @xmath77 travels as a whole to the right at a constant speed @xmath6 , as can be seen in fig.[fig : fig2](a ) .    for @xmath142 and @xmath129 eq.([12 ] )",
