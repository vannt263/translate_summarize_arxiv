    "the hirota - ohta system @xcite was introduced by means of pfaffianization applied to the kadomtsev - petviashvili equation , that is as a result of a certain procedure which allows to replace multi - soliton solutions represented by determinants with solutions represented by pfaffians .",
    "later on , this procedure was applied to many other equations , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the differential - difference member of the hirota - ohta hierarchy known as the pfaff lattice @xcite was introduced within the theory of random matrix models .",
    "the whole hierarchy can be derived also within the general approach based on clifford algebra representations and the boson - fermion correspondence @xcite , for example , this technique was used for the derivation of bcklund transformation @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we suggest an alternative and more simple derivation of the hirota - ohta hierarchy by use of zakharov - shabat method @xcite based on the study of auxiliary linear problems . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "such linear problems for the continuous part of the hierarchy appeared so far only in paper @xcite . the completely discrete hirota - ohta system was found for the first time , apparently , in paper @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear from this work , whether this discrete system belongs to the hirota - ohta hierarchy or just serves as its discrete analog . in section [ s : ho ] , we answer in the affirmative to this question and provide the consistent linear problems for all discrete levels of the hirota - ohta system , that is for the systems with one , two and three discrete variables .",
    "the linear problems under consideration are rather deep reductions .",
    "for example , in the completely discrete case , we consider a 2-component 4-point scheme with three field variables only , while the generic scheme of such type corresponding to the discrete darboux - zakharov - manakov system @xcite contains eight fields ( two @xmath0 matrices ) .",
    "the following empirical observation allows to recognize these reductions :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the structure of _ linear _ problems for 3-dimensional hirota - ohta hierarchy coincides with the structure of 2-dimensional hierarchy of _ nonlinear _ schrdinger equation ( nls ) .",

    "we recall some standard equations from the nls hierarchy : the third order higher symmetry , bcklund transformations and the nonlinear superposition principle .",
    "these equations are used as a hint while choosing the form of the linear problems for the hirota - ohta hierarchy in section [ s : ho ] .",
    "a more precise conformity with the theory of 2-dimensional systems is pointed out in section [ s : vnls ] devoted to the vectorial generalization of nls by kulish and skkyanin @xcite .",
    "this correspondence was found in @xcite by one of the authors unaware of hirota - ohta results at that moment .",
    "the following notations are used below . the field variables @xmath1",
    "depend on the infinite set of independent continuous variables @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and integer - valued variables @xmath5 .",
    "subscripts @xmath6 denote the partial derivatives , and subscripts @xmath7 denote the shifts on the discrete variables : @xmath8 , minus sign denoting the backward shift : @xmath9 .",
    "the nonlinear schrdinger equation is of the form @xmath10 its simplest higher symmetry is of third order : @xmath11 the discrete variable @xmath12 will play the distinguished role in what follows .",
    "the corresponding shift defines bcklund - schlesinger transformation as the explicit mapping @xmath13 which acts on the solutions of systems ( [ nls.y ] ) , ( [ nls.t ] ) .",
    "the iterations of this mapping are governed , under the change @xmath14 , @xmath15 , by the toda lattice @xmath16 all other discrete variables correspond to bcklund - darboux transformations ; @xmath17-parts of these transformations are of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an arbitrary parameter , associated with @xmath20-th discrete coordinate direction and depending on @xmath21 only ( that is , @xmath22 at @xmath23 ) .",
    "second equation ( [ nls.bi ] ) defines @xmath24 as a solution of riccati equation , then @xmath25 is explicitly found from the first equation .",
    "a generic bcklund transformation for the nls equation is decomposed as a sequence of elementary transformations of the form ( [ nls.b1 ] ) , ( [ nls.bi ] ) and their inverses .",
    "the completely discrete part of the nls hierarchy is described by 5-point equations of discrete toda type @xmath26 and 2-component quad - equations @xmath27 equations ( [ nls.1i ] ) define the permutability property of the transformations ( [ nls.b1 ] ) and ( [ nls.bi ] ) .",
    "this means that equation ( [ nls.1i ] ) is consistent with the differentiation @xmath28 that is the derivative with respect to @xmath17 of the left - hand side of ( [ nls.1i ] ) vanishes in virtue of ( [ nls.1i ] ) itself .",
    "moreover , the variables @xmath29 at fixed @xmath21 satisfy the toda lattice ( [ nls.qxx ] ) , and variables @xmath30 , @xmath31 at fixed @xmath12 satisfy the lattice ( [ nls.bi ] ) .",

    "the mappings @xmath38 satisfy an important 3d - consistency property expressed by the yang - baxter identity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rrr ] ) @xmath39 an essential distinction with the scalar quad - equations @xcite is that equations ( [ nls.ij ] ) can not be solved with respect to variables @xmath33 or @xmath35 .",
    "hence the formulation of 3d - consistency is possible here only under a choice of the initial data along some sequence of the vertices of the cube , for example @xmath33 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "we keep the previous notations for the derivatives and shifts with respect to the independent variables . as for the dependent variables , now @xmath43 and @xmath44 play the role of wave - functions , while the field variables will be denoted @xmath45 , @xmath46 ( coefficients of linear problems ) and @xmath47 ( @xmath48-functions ) .",
    "superscripts in @xmath49 , @xmath50 indicate that these variables are associated with the corresponding direction or plane in the lattice ( but , in contrast to parameters @xmath19 from the previous section , these depend on the whole set of independent variables ) .",
    "we accept the following linearization of the nls equation ( [ nls.y ] ) as a starting point : @xmath51 now , let us search for a commuting flow of the form @xmath52 with undetermined coefficients ( that is , the cubic terms in ( [ nls.t ] ) are replaced with the linear combination of the factors ) .",

    "it is clear that its higher symmetries can be derived quite analogously by use of the linear problems of higher order with respect to @xmath55 ; however , we will skip this .",
    "the change of variables @xmath56 brings the system ( [ ho ] ) to the bilinear form @xmath57   & ( 2d_t-3d_xd_y+d^3_x)f\\cdot h=0,\\\\   & ( 2d_t+3d_xd_y+d^3_x)g\\cdot h=0,\\\\   & ( 4d_xd_t-3d^2_y - d^4_x)h\\cdot h+24fg=0 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 denotes the hirota operator .",

    "the resulting nonlinear relations for the coefficients contain , in particular , the conservation laws which imply the parametrization of @xmath50 given in ( [ ww ] ) .",
    "the rest relations then turn out to be equivalent to system ( [ ho.ijk ] ) .",
    "a wide and well - known class of reductions from 3-dimensional equations to vectorial 2-dimensional ones consists of so - called squared eigenfunction constraints .",

    "it is worth noticing also the relation of above discrete linear problems with self - adjoint 5- and 7-point schemes , on square and triangular lattices respectively .",
    "the linear problems of this type attracted much attention recently .",
    "in particular , it is known that they appear from the scalar 4-point schemes on square and rhombic lattices as a result of restriction on even / odd sublattices @xcite . in our case ,",
    "such linear problems appear from 2-component linear problems presented in section [ s : ho ] as a result of elimination of one component .",
    "for instance , the elimination of @xmath44 from ( [ ho.1 ] ) and ( [ ho.i ] ) yields the following 5-point equation ( compare with discrete toda lattice ( [ nls.1i ] ) ) : @xmath95 analogously , eliminating @xmath44 from equations ( [ ho.ij ] ) results in the 7-point linear problem in the plane @xmath96 .",
    "we mention that some examples of continuous toda - like dynamics associated with 5- and 7-point linear problems were studied in the papers @xcite .",
