    "exclusive @xmath1 decays provide us with important information on the structure of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "however , the theoretical calculation of absolute branching fractions is complicated by the fact that a rather detailed knowledge of strong interaction effects is required .",
    "the theoretical situation with regard to strong interaction dynamics improves as one considers more inclusive final states . at leading order in @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the @xmath11 quark mass and @xmath12 the strong interaction scale , the totally inclusive @xmath1 decay rate can be computed completely in perturbation theory .",
    "however , it is not necessary that the process be totally inclusive .",
    "a semi - inclusive decay @xmath13 can also be treated perturbatively in part , provided the formation of the hadron @xmath0 proceeds through a short - distance process .",
    "this is the case , if @xmath0 is a charmonium state , because the production of a charm - quark @xmath8 pair requires energies much larger than @xmath14 .",
    "the bound state dynamics of @xmath0 then factorizes and can be parametrized .",
    "this statement is summarized by the factorization formula @xcite @xmath15+x)\\,\\langle { \\cal o}^h[n]\\rangle,\\ ] ] which is valid up to power corrections of order @xmath16 .",
    "( to this accuracy it is justified to treat the @xmath1 meson as a free @xmath11 quark . )",
    "the parameters @xmath17\\rangle$ ] , defined in @xcite , are sensitive to the charmonium bound state scales of order @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the typical charm quark velocity in the charmonium bound state . with @xmath21 for @xmath5",
    "we consider these scales to be too small to be treated perturbatively . on the other hand",
    "the coefficient functions @xmath22+x)$ ] describe the production of a @xmath8 configuration @xmath23 at short distances and can be expanded in the strong coupling @xmath24 at a scale @xmath25 of order @xmath26 .",
    "we have expressed the decay rate in terms of several non - perturbative parameters @xmath27\\rangle$ ] .",
    "the predictive power lies in the fact that these parameters are independent of the particular charmonium production process and hence are constrained by other charmonium production processes .    because charmonia pass as non - relativistic systems , eq .",

    "in addition @xmath33 refers to a colour singlet or a colour octet configuration . in the present work",
    "we calculate the short - distance coefficients for @xmath34 at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in @xmath35 .",
    "as we discuss later , we believe that these terms in the velocity expansion are sufficient to reliably predict ( to about 25% , barring radiative corrections in @xmath35 ) the decay rates into @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and the elusive @xmath38 state @xmath39 as a function of the long - distance parameters @xmath27\\rangle$ ] .",
    "we find that , given the present uncertainties in the long - distance parameters , the experimentally observed branching fraction @xcite for @xmath5 and @xmath6 can easily be accounted for at nlo .",
    "however , we find it difficult to account for the observed @xmath40 and @xmath41 branching fractions simultaneously , because the @xmath35 expansion of the colour singlet contribution in @xmath40 production turns out to be untrustworthy at nlo .",
    "the nlo corrections typically enhance the decay rate by about ( 20 - 50)% in the colour octet channels and lead to bounds on the long - distance parameters , which should be useful for the phenomenology of other charmonium production processes .",
    "we also compute weights of the charmonium energy distribution , which yield additional information .",
    "the shape of the energy distribution itself , however , is difficult to predict , because it is distorted by the motion of the @xmath11 quark in the @xmath1 meson and the energy taken away in the hadronization of a @xmath8 state @xmath23 .",
    "this distortion averages out in weighted sums , as long as the weights are sufficiently smooth .",
    "we then compare the inclusive calculation for @xmath42 with the sum of the measured decay rates for @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the comparison suggests a significant fraction of multi - body decays , consistent with the energy spectrum observed by cleo @xcite . a substantial contribution from multi - body decays is also reassuring from the point of view of validity of the theoretical calculation .",
    "factorization implies that a @xmath8 state @xmath23 hadronizes into a @xmath5 plus light hadrons independent of the remaining decay process up to corrections of order @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath23 refers to a colour octet state , the conversion into charmonium requires the emission of at least one gluon .",
    "although colour reconnections with the spectator quark in the @xmath1 meson must eventually occur , we expect a charmonium produced through a colour octet @xmath8 state to be accompanied by more than one light hadron more often than for a colour singlet @xmath8 state .",
    "since we find that a large fraction of the total decay rate is from colour octet intermediate states , we also expect a large fraction of multi - body final states .",
    "this evidence also suggests to us that the energy released in the @xmath1 meson decay into charmonium is already large enough for an inclusive treatment to be applicable .",

    "the next - to - leading order corrections to the colour octet channels computed in this paper are positive and of order 20%50% . assuming that these channels make up for the missing contribution , we adjust a certain combination of nrqcd matrix elements to reproduce the experimental branching fraction .",

    "since the @xmath35 expansion appears to be well - behaved for @xmath5 production , we obtain the sharpest upper bound to date on a combination of @xmath264 and @xmath265 , even when we assume that there are no other production mechanisms . in principle , with more accurate data appearing , weights on the @xmath5 momentum distribution can also be used to determine @xmath264 and @xmath265 individually , which has so far proven to be difficult , even combining information from other @xmath5 production processes .",
