    "cognitive radio ( cr ) technology @xcite is a key enabler for the opportunistic spectrum access ( osa ) model @xcite , a potentially revolutionary new paradigm for dynamic sharing of licenced spectrum with unlicensed devices . in this operational mode",
    "a cognitive radio acts as a spectrum scavenger .",
    "it performs spectrum sensing over a range of frequency bands , dynamically identifies unused spectrum , and then operates in this spectrum at times and/or locations when / where it is not used by incumbent radio systems .",
    "opportunistic spectrum access can take place both on a temporal and a spatial basis .",
    "in temporal opportunistic access a cognitive radio monitors the activity of the licensee in a given location and uses the licensed frequency at times that it is idle .",
    "an example of this is the operation of cognitive radio in the radar and umts bands",
    ". in spatial opportunistic access cognitive devices identify geographical regions where certain licensed bands are unused and access these bands without causing harmful interference to the operation of the incumbent in nearby regions .",
    "currently cognitive radio is being intensively researched for opportunistic access to the so - called tv white spaces ( tvws ) : large portions of the vhf / uhf tv bands which become available on a geographical basis after the digital switchover . in the us the fcc ( federal communications commission ) proposed to allow opportunistic access to tv bands already in 2004 @xcite .",
    "prototype cognitive radios operating in this mode were put forward to fcc by adaptrum , i@xmath0r , microsoft , motorola and philips in 2008 @xcite .",
    "after extensive tests the fcc adopted in november 2008 a second report and order that establishes rules to allow the operation of cognitive devices in tvws on a secondary basis @xcite . furthermore , in what is potentially a radical shift in policy , in its recently released digital dividend review statement @xcite the uk regulator , ofcom , is proposing to `` allow licence exempt use of interleaved spectrum for cognitive devices . ''",
    "furthermore ofcom states that `` we see significant scope for cognitive equipments using interleaved spectrum to emerge and to benefit from international economics of scale '' @xcite .",
    "more recently , on february 16 2009 , ofcom published a new consultation providing further details of its proposed cognitive access to tv white spaces @xcite .    with both the us and uk adapting the osa model , and",
    "the emerging 802.22 standard for cognitive access to tv bands @xcite being at the final stage , we can expect that , if successful , this new paradigm will become mainstream among spectrum regulators worldwide .",
    "however , while a number of recent papers have examined various aspects of cognitive radio access to tvws in the united states @xcite , there is currently very little quantitative information on the _ global _ spectrum opportunities that may result if cr operation in tv bands becomes acceptable in other countries in the world .    to bridge this gap ,",
    "we present in this paper a quantitative analysis of tv white spaces availability for cognitive radio access in the united kingdom . using accurate digital tv ( dtv ) coverage maps together with a database of dtv transmitters ,",
    "we develop a methodology for identifying tvws frequencies at any location in the uk .",
    "we use our methodology to investigate the variations in tvws as a function of the location and transmit power of cognitive radios , and examine how constraints on adjacent channel emissions of cognitive radios may affects the results .",
    "our analysis provides a realistic view on the potential spectrum opportunity associated with cognitive radio access to twvs in the uk , and presents the first quantitative study of the availability and frequency composition of twvs outside the united states .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss in detail the operation of cognitive radio devices in the vhf / uhf tv bands .",
    "this is followed by a description of our methodology for estimating twvs frequencies .",
    "section iii presents results of our study of the availability of tvws in @xmath1 locations in the uk and analyses the implications of our findings .",
    "we conclude this paper in section v.",
    "broadcast television services operate in licensed channels in the vhf and uhf portions of the radio spectrum .",
    "the regulatory rules in most countries prohibit the use of unlicensed devices in tv bands , with the exception of remote control , medical telemetry devices and wireless microphones . in most developed countries regulators are currently in the process of requiring tv stations to convert from analog to digital transmission .",
    "this _ digital switchover _ is expected to be completed in the us in 2009 and in the uk in 2012 .",
    "a similar switchover process is also underway or being planned ( or is already completed ) in the rest of the eu and many other countries around the world .",
    "after digital switchover a portion of tv analogue channels become entirely vacant due to the higher spectrum efficiency of digital tv ( dtv ) .",
    "these cleared channels will then be reallocated by regulators to other services , for example through auctions .",
    "in addition , after the dtv transition there will be typically a number of tv channels in a given geographic area that are not being used by dtv stations , because such stations would not be able to operate without causing interference to co - channel or adjacent channel stations .",
    "these requirements are based on the assumption that stations operate at maximum power .",
    "however , a transmitter operating on a vacant tv channel at a much lower power level would not need a great separation from co - channel and adjacent channel tv stations to avoid causing interference .",
    "low power unlicensed devices can operate on vacant channels in locations that could not be used by tv stations due to interference concerns @xcite .",
    "these vacant tv channels are known as tv white spaces , or interleaved spectrum in the parlance of the uk regulator .",
    "opportunistic operation of cognitive radios in tv bands , however , is conditioned on the ability of these devices to avoid harmful interference to licensed users of these bands , which in addition to dtv include also wireless microphones @xcite . in november 2008",
    ", the fcc adopted a report setting out rules allowing licence - exempt cognitive devices to operate in tv white spaces . in summary",
    "these rules require cognitive devices to use a combination of spectrum sensing and geolocation .",
    "the devices must be able to sense both tv signals and wireless microphones down to @xmath2 dbm , and must also locate their position to within @xmath3 meters accuracy and then consult a database that will inform them about available spectrum in that location .",
    "devices without geolocation capabilities are also allowed if they are transmitting to a device that has determined its location .",
    "cognitive devices that use sensing alone are allowed in principle .",
    "however , the fcc states that such devices will be `` subject to a much more rigorous approval process '' @xcite .",
    "the fundamental reason why tvws have attracted much interest is an exceptionally attractive combination of bandwidth and coverage .",
    "signals in tv bands , travel much further than both the wifi and 3 g signals and penetrate buildings more readily .",
    "this in turn means that these bands can be used for a very wide range of potential new services , including last mile wireless broadband in urban environments , broadband wireless access in rural areas @xcite , new types of mobile broadband and wireless networks for digital homes .",
    "furthermore , in the case of the uhf bands , the wavelength of signals in these bands is sufficiently short such that resonant antennas with sufficiently small footprint can be used which are acceptable for many portable use cases and handheld devices @xcite .",

    "in this paper we presented a methodology for estimating the uk tv white spaces for opportunistic access by cognitive radios . using our methodology we examined the availability of this spectrum and its channel composition in @xmath1 uk population centres .",
    "our analysis shows on average @xmath4 mhz of tvws is available for access by low - power cognitive radios .",
    "we found , however , that in many locations this considerable bandwidth is fragmented into many non - adjacent channels .",
    "consequently , we conclude that the availability of novel pooling techniques , such as nc - ofdm @xcite is crucial for effective utilisation of tvws , in particular for future high bandwidth applications . finally , we examined the effect of constraints on adjacent channel interference imposed by regulators / standards on tvws , and showed that such constraints drastically reduce the availability of this spectrum .",
    "most future use scenarios of tvws will involve multiple cognitive devices operating within the same geographical region @xcite .",
    "some of our future work will focus on new methodologies for estimation and control of _ aggregated _ cognitive radio interference in such scenarios .",
    "we are also working on improved tvws estimation methods for high power use cases .",
    "the author is grateful to brian butterworh ( uk free.tv ) for providing access to his dtv coverage data , and to keith briggs ( bt ) , yang fang and anjum pervez ( south bank university ) for their valuable contributions .",
    "m. a. stuzra and f. ghazvinian , can cognitive radio technology operating in the tv white spaces completely protect licensed tv broadcasting ? ,",
