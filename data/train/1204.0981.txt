    ", it can show two quantum phases , a superfluid regime for weak interactions and a mott - insulator phase for strong interactions and commensurate filling @xcite .",
    "electron beams can provide means for locally probing ultracold quantum gasses since they can be focused onto spot sizes that are much smaller than the optical wavelengths of the trapping fields .",
    "high - resolution scanning electron microscopy thus constitutes a method that combines single atom sensitivity and high spatial resolution @xcite . for this technique , a focused electron beam scans an optically trapped atomic gas .",
    "the atoms are ionized by the electron impact and the produced ions are moved off the dipole trap by an electrostatic field . with this method ,",
    "single - site addressability of ultracold atomic gases loaded in optical lattices has been demonstrated in one and two dimensional structures @xcite .",
    "in addition , second and higher order correlation functions of a trapped gas of bosons have been extracted @xcite .",
    "besides providing a tool for local measurements , a focused electron beam can also be used as a method to introduce controlled localized dissipation . along these lines",
    ", the formation of solitons in a continuous system with a localized dissipative perturbation has been discussed employing a mean field approach @xcite and corrections beyond the mean field level have also been considered @xcite . moreover , a three - site bose - hubbard model with dissipation in the central lattice site has been analyzed @xcite and a numerical study of the dynamics during a finite time range that employed dmrg methods has been presented @xcite .    in this article",
    "we investigate the effect of a localized dissipative defect in a bose - hubbard model with analytical means .",
    "this allows us to consider arbitrarily large lattices as well as the long time limit of the dynamics . for the non - interacting case ,",
    "we show that a certain fraction of the population of a uniform particle distribution is not affected by dissipation that is localized in the center of the trap .",
    "in other words , we show the existence of a dissipation - free subspace for localized particle losses .",
    "furthermore we find for a one - dimensional model that a fraction of the particles can propagate across the dissipative defect even if the rate of tunneling between adjacent lattice sites is much slower than the loss rate at the defect .",
    "particles can however only tunnel through the dissipative defect at the expense of other particles being lost via the localized dissipation .    for the description of the system we employ a born - markov master equation in the standard lindblad form @xcite .",
    "this equation represents the dynamics of the system under the influence of a mechanism that introduces one - by - one particle losses at one lattice site .",
    "we start by investigating a non - interacting system with the defect located exactly at the center of the chain . in this case",
    ", we show the existence of a dissipation - free subspace which consists of the half of the normal modes of the hamiltonian .",
    "those are the modes that correspond to wave - functions which are anti - symmetric with respect to the trap center .",
    "the bosons of those modes interfere destructively at the location of the defect and therefore never reach the lossy site .",
    "since their wavefunction is finite everywhere else , these bosons can tunnel between the right and the left sides of the system without appearing at the defect .",
    "after this observation , we investigate cases that might present dynamical behavior similar to that of the non - interacting and symmetric one .",
    "most important candidates are cases that correspond to small deviations from the non - interacting and symmetric case .",
    "one way to introduce such a deviation is to turn on small interactions while keeping the symmetric structure of the system .",
    "interactions destroy the phase coherence along the lattice since they can transform protected to unprotected modes . also in a non - interacting system with a slightly non - symmetric structure , we find that the destructive interference of particles that tunnel into the defect and therefore the dissipation free subspace are perturbed .",
    "for those two types of small deviations from the non - interacting and symmetric case , namely small interactions and slightly non - symmetric structure , we show that there is a slow down of the losses for some fraction of the total population .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce our model and discuss general properties of particles in trapping potentials that are symmetric around a dissipative defect . in section iii",
    ", we present quantitative results for non - interacting bosons on a lattice with a dissipative defect in the central lattice site .",
    "section iv then discusses small deviations from the interaction - free and perfectly symmetric case and we finish the presentation with a summary and conclusions in section v.",
    "various quantum systems can feature states that are protected against certain types of dissipation .",
    "those states - often referred to as dark states - are well known in atomic physics and quantum optics @xcite . in many - body systems",
    "such states can appear as a property of a symmetry of a given hamiltonian and be part of its eigenstates .",
    "one of the symmetries that can generate such a dissipation - free subspace is the symmetry under reflection at the origin of the system . in other words ,",
    "when the potential is symmetric around a localized dissipative defect .",
    "we consider a single particle in a symmetric potential .",
    "such a potential is described by an even function @xmath0 with @xmath1 .",
    "the wavefunctions that correspond to eigenstates of such a potential must have a well defined parity , i.e. some are even ( @xmath2 ) and others are odd ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "these properties emerge since the schrdinger equation is unchanged when the sign of a coordinate is reversed @xcite .",
    "if one lists the eigenfunctions according to the number of nodes - increasing energy - then they are alternately even and odd .",
    "the ground state of the system must be an even function since it contains no nodes .",
    "odd functions always vanish at the origin , since @xmath4 this means that whatever happens at this particular location in space does not affect the odd eigenfunctions .",
    "a physical interpretation of this result is that the probability amplitudes for particles in odd eigenstates destructively interfere at the origin .",
    "now , let us assume that we locate a mechanism that introduces particles losses at the origin .",
    "then , if the particle is in a odd eigenfunction , it will never be caught by the loss mechanism .",
    "this is to say , the odd eigenfunctions constitute a dissipation - free subspace .      the effect of the dissipation - free subspace may seem ( almost ) unphysical in a continuous description .",
    "this is because we silently assumed that the loss mechanism has zero spatial width .",
    "however , this would nt be problematic in a lattice setup . if we assume that the relevant physics takes place within the lowest band of a tight binding hamiltonian ,",
    "i.e. the energy of the system is low enough , then the lattice sites can be treated as points in space since their extension is much smaller than the wavelength of the mode - functions . therefore , the only requirement for the loss mechanism is to be restricted to one lattice site , specifically the central one - we assume odd number of sites .",
    "therefore the mechanism that generates the losses needs to be capable of addressing single lattice sites , see fig .",

    "our assumptions for the decay term are well justified . here",
    "the atoms are ionized by the electron impact and then extracted from the lattice with an electric field .",
    "therefore subsequent particle decays will be independent of each other which justifies the markov assumption , c.f . @xcite .      in an experimental setup with cold atoms in an optical lattice ,",
    "the atoms are not only subject to the lattice potential but are also trapped by an additional confining potential that is usually well approximated by a harmonic trap . in the central region of the lattice , the value of the confining potential typically only varies very little from one lattice site to another and we therefore approximate it by a constant . in current experiments",
    "it is however not guaranteed that the bottom of the confining potential exactly overlaps with the site of the lattice where losses are induced . to estimate the effect of this feature on our findings",
    ", we consider deviations from a lattice that is symmetric with respect to the dissipative site in section [ notideal ] .",

    "the hamiltonian  ( [ superfluid ] ) in one dimension is written in the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the total number of lattice sites .",
    "we assume open boundary conditions , which imply that the wavefunction vanishes at the edges of the system .",

    ", we use @xmath101 which stands for `` random '' . from the structure of the normal modes in equation ( [ obc ] )",
    "one can see that for each location @xmath102 , those modes with vanishing amplitude at @xmath102 are protected against losses affecting the site @xmath102 only .",
    "a general tendency to what degree the dissipation free subspace is degraded by deviations from the symmetry of the setup can be obtained from the following consideration .",
    "we assume , without loss of generality , that the defect is located at a site on the left of the center of the lattice .",

    "that means that the modes with even quasi - momentum labeling number that correspond to the symmetric part and all the modes that correspond to the left - over part are not directly affected by the particle losses .",
    "since we consider again a non - interacting case , the unitary part of the evolution of the system is governed by the hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ superfluid1d ] ) . in order to write this hamiltonian in terms of the mode operators ( [ sym - modes ] ) and ( [ left - over ] ) , we split it into three parts , @xmath110 the first part of the above hamiltonian describes the symmetric part of the system , the second describes the left - over sites and the last one gives the tunneling between the last site of the symmetric part and the first one of the left - over part .",
    "now , in terms of the modes ( [ sym - modes ] ) and ( [ left - over ] ) , the hamiltonian reads , @xmath111 where we have defined , @xmath112 the above hamiltonian includes a tunneling term between the modes of the symmetric part and the left - over ones .",
    "this tunneling process can transform protected to unprotected modes and destroys the effect of the dissipation - free subspace .",
    "however , if the tunneling between both parts of the lattice occurs slowly compared to the rate of particle losses at the defect , then one expects a slow - down of particle losses for the modes with even quasi - momentum labeling number .",
    "in such a case , the system approximately resembles the behavior of the ideal case described in the first section , at least for short times .",
    "we therefore analyze this case in a similar way as the case of small interactions .",

    "where @xmath118 , the ratio is approximately written , @xmath119   \\approx \\frac{j}{\\gamma } \\sqrt{n}.\\ ] ] this indicates that there is no slow down of particle losses as long as @xmath120 . in the opposite case ,",

    "in this article we have considered the bose - hubbard model with particle losses at one lattice site . for the non - interacting case",
    ", we found that particles in normal modes with vanishing amplitude at the dissipative defect are not affected by the localized losses .",
    "for a one - dimensional model with the lossy site exactly in the center of the chain , half the modes thus form a dissipation free subspace .",
    "this behavior can be attributed to a destructive interference of particles tunneling into the defect .",
    "furthermore a fraction of the particles can propagate across the dissipative defect even if the rate of tunneling between adjacent lattice sites is much slower than the loss rate at the defect .",
    "our findings could be studied experimentally with ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice , where an electron beam on a single lattice site ionizes atoms that are then extracted by an electrostatic field .",
