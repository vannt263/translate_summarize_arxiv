    "realization of a high fidelity quantum state transfer between two nodes of a quantum network is a crucial task in quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "hybrid quantum systems involving atoms @xcite , ions @xcite , superconducting circuits @xcite , and quantum mechanical oscillators @xcite are shown to be useful in realizing a high fidelity transfer .",
    "in particular , hybrid systems consisting of electromagnetic and mechanical oscillators are promising platforms for transferring a quantum state from site to site or for a quantum memory .",
    "quantum state transfer between optical and microwave cavities mediated by a quantum mechanical oscillator has been proposed @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in all of these studies the two electromagnetic cavities are not physically far apart .",
    "implementation of quantum state transfer between remote resonators or qubits using flying qubits in a quantum network is desirable and opens the possibility for a variety of novel applications such as entangled - state cryptography @xcite , teleportation @xcite , and purification @xcite among others .",
    "besides , as being a bridge to interface between two electromagnetic cavities , quantum mechanical oscillators can be used as a quantum memory device and a frequency transducer @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a scheme for the transfer of a quantum state between an optical cavity and a distant mechanical oscillator coupled to an optical cavity via radiation pressure .",
    "we refer to this procedure as a `` writing '' protocol .",
    "the transfer is mediated by a flying qubit and can be realized with an efficiency arbitrarily close to unity .",
    "we also analyze the reverse process in which a quantum state stored in the mechanical mode transferred to the optical mode in a distant cavity ; we refer to this procedure as a `` reading '' protocol .",
    "such a high efficiency state transfer is achieved by using time - varying cavity damping rates and destructive interference .",
    "modulation of the cavity damping rate can also be used to speed up the cooling process while suppressing the heating noise @xcite . using experimental parameters @xcite and for a moderate mechanical quality factor @xmath2 ,",
    "a transfer efficiency as high as @xmath0 can be achieved .",
    "we also propose a quantum memory device using the mechanical oscillator s degrees of freedom .",
    "we show that due to the long life time ( in ms time scale ) of the mechanical mode , it is possible to build a quantum memory with a reasonably long storage time .",
    "rapid retrieval of the stored quantum state can be realized by designing appropriate optomechanical coupling pulses .",
    "we find that for the moderate mechanical q - factor , a quantum state can be stored and retrieved with @xmath1 efficiency .",
    "we emphasize that even though we considered quantum state transfer between two optical cavities , the idea can be extended to the state transfer between two microwave resonators using superconducting quantum circuits or other experimental setups described in refs .",
    "we consider an optical cavity spatially separated from a second optical cavity that is coupled to a mechanical oscillator .",
    "we propose and analyze two state transfer protocols . in the first protocol ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) we consider a quantum state encoded onto the optical mode of the first cavity and transfer it to the mechanical mode coupled to the second cavity via radiation pressure .",
    "we refer to this process as a  writing \" protocol , because the quantum state is mapped onto the mechanical degrees of freedom . in the second protocol ( see fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) , a quantum state stored in the mechanical oscillator that is coupled to the second cavity mode is transferred to the optical mode in the first cavity via a flying qubit ( propagating photon ) .",
    "we refer to this process as a `` reading '' protocol . in both protocols , to avoid multiple reflections between the two cavities , we use a faraday s isolator so that the reflected field at the second cavity will be directly sent to a detector .    in order to reduce the dissipation during the photon propagation in the transmission channel ,",
    "the two cavities can be coupled via an optical fiber ( for case of optical cavities ) or by a microwave superconducting transmission line ( for microwave cavities ) .",
    "recently , an efficient coupling between an optical fiber and a cavity has been realized @xcite .",
    "a high efficiency quantum state transfer can be realized by cancelling the back - reflection at the second cavity via destructive interference @xcite .",
    "an almost perfect cancellation can be achieved by either time - varying the damping rate of the first cavity , second cavity , or both . in the following",
    "we discuss the `` writing '' and `` reading '' protocols by using time - varying cavity damping rates .",
    "here we consider an initial quantum state encoded on the optical mode of cavity 1 and transfer it to the mechanical mode in the second cavity via a flying qubit ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this can be interpreted as `` writing '' a quantum state onto the mechanical degrees of freedom , which can later be retrieved using the opposite procedure``reading '' ( transfer of a quantum state from mechanical to optical mode ) .    in the interaction picture and in a displaced frame with respect to the classical mean value in each cavity",
    ", the hamiltonian can be written as @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mechanical frequency , @xmath5 is the annihilation operator for the mechanical mode , @xmath6 is the many - photon optomechanical coupling , @xmath7 is the detuning of the optical drive applied to the @xmath8th cavity , @xmath9 is the annihilation operator for the @xmath8th cavity mode .     and @xmath10 .",
    "the output field @xmath11 from the first cavity propagates away and becomes an input to the second cavity . to avoid multiple refections between the cavities ,",
    "we use a faraday s isolator .",
    "this allows the output @xmath12 of the second cavity to be directly go to the detector .",
    ", width=321 ]    using this hamiltonian , we obtain the quantum langevin equations for the cavity and mechanical mode operators @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the mechanical oscillator damping rate , @xmath15 is the @xmath8th cavity damping rate , @xmath16 is the noise operator for the mechanical oscillator bath , while @xmath17 describes the quantum noise of the vacuum field incident on the @xmath8th cavity .",
    "note that due to the unidirectional coupling the output of the cavity 1 is an input to cavity 2 with appropriate time delay , that is , @xmath18 .",
    "thus , using input - output relation for cavity 1 : @xmath19 , the input noise operator at cavity 2 is given by @xmath20 in view of this , the equation for the cavity mode operator @xmath21 becomes @xmath22    it is worth noting that due to unidirectional coupling eqs .",
    "is decoupled from .",
    "this unidirectional coupling is an example of the so - called quantum cascade system @xcite .",
    "the time delay @xmath23 can be eliminated by defining a `` time - delayed '' operators for the first cavity and for the mechanical oscillator , for example , @xmath24 , @xmath25 . in the following",
    "we assume that we have performed these transformations and for simplicity we drop the tilde , which amounts to @xmath26 in all equations .",
    "note that , in principle , the detunings @xmath7 can be arbitrarily chosen provided that the system remains stable .",
    "however , since we are interested in quantum state transfer from one system to the other ( in our case from cavity 1 to the mechanical oscillator ) it is necessary to choose cavity - laser detuning to be tuned at the mechanical frequency , i.e. , @xmath27 .",
    "thus , in a frame rotating with @xmath4 and choosing @xmath27 , eqs .",
    ", , and reduce to    @xmath28    it has been shown that @xcite a high efficiency quantum state transfer between two remote cavities connected by a transmission line can be realized by cancelling the back reflection at the receiving cavity .",
    "this can be achieved by designing time - varying cavity 1 , cavity 2 , or both damping rates so that the field emitted has an exponentially increasing / decreasing waveform that allows destructive interference at the receiving cavity . in this paper , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we divide the protocol in two parts . in the first part",
    ", we assume the first cavity damping rate @xmath29 varies in time , while the damping rate of the second cavity is fixed at its maximum value , @xmath30 . in order to derive the time - profile of the damping rate @xmath29 ,",
    "we assume a simpler problem : state transfer between two cavities .",
    "thus the formal solution of eq . , after dropping the @xmath6 term and assuming the cavities are coupled to a vacuum environment , has the form @xmath31 if the state is initially encoded onto the mode of the first cavity @xmath32 and the second cavity is initially in vacuum state , the state transfer efficiency can be defined as @xcite @xmath33 we next search for optimum pulse shapes of the damping rate @xmath29 that maximizes the efficiency @xmath34 for the first part of the procedure .",
    "this can be done using the euler - lagrange formalism .",
    "the damping rates satisfy the differential equation @xcite @xmath35 therefore , during the first part of the procedure @xmath36 , the damping rat @xmath37 obtained by solving eq .",
    "is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the maximum value of the first cavity damping rate .",
    "in the second part of the procedure , the damping rate of the first cavity remain constat , @xmath40 , while the damping rate of the receiving cavity decreases in time . using the time reversal symmetry , the pulse shape of the damping rate @xmath10 which maximizes the efficiency @xmath41 of the second part of the procedure @xmath42",
    "can be written as @xmath43 the derivation of the pulse shapes and of the damping rates assume the state transfer between two cavities . in the following , we use the same pulse shapes to analyze the transfer of a quantum state between the first cavity to the mechanical oscillator coupled to the second cavity mode .",
    "this is because the state has to first be transferred before it is mapped to the mechanical oscillator .",
    "note that the pulse shapes eqs . and",
    "were also derived invoking the destructive interference condition for the cancellation of the back - reflected field into the environment @xcite . to analyze the quantum state transfer when",
