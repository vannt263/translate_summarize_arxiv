    "the yang - baxter equation in its spectral parameter - dependent form has well - known applications in a variety of areas of mathematical physics , including exactly solvable classical models of two - dimensional statistical mechanics and integrable quantum systems .",
    "the origins of the field trace back to the influential works by mcguire concerning many - body systems with delta function interactions @xcite , yang s solution for interacting fermions @xcite , and baxter s solution of the eight - vertex model @xcite . since then numerous solutions have been obtained including those leading to the perk - schultz model @xcite , the andrews - baxter - forrester model @xcite , the chiral potts model @xcite and the hubbard model @xcite to name a few .",
    "one systematic method for solving the yang - baxter equation was found with the advent of affine quantum algebras , which are deformations of the universal enveloping algebras of affine classical lie algebras @xcite . through the drinfeld double construction @xcite",
    ", the affine quantum algebras can be seen to belong to a larger class of algebras which are referred to as _ quasi - triangular hopf _ algebras .",
    "the double construction provides a universal prescription for constructing a quasi - triangular hopf algebra , denoted @xmath1 , from any hopf algebra @xmath2 and its dual algebra @xmath3 . via this construction",
    "there exists a canonical element in the tensor product algebra of the drinfeld double , @xmath4 , known as the universal @xmath5-matrix .",
    "this element provides an algebraic solution of the yang - baxter equation .",
    "thus for each matrix representation of @xmath1 , a matrix solution of the yang - baxter equation is automatically obtained .",
    "solutions of the yang - baxter equation with spectral parameter arise whenever matrix representations of @xmath1 can be parameterised by one or more continuous variables . in the context of affine quantum algebras ,",
    "the spectral parameter arises naturally by consideration of an evaluation homomorphism from the affine quantum algebra to its non - affine counterpart . in this manner",
    "the representations of the affine quantum algebras which give solutions with spectral parameter are the loop representations . in principle",
    "the evaluation homomorphism provides a route to algebraic solutions of the yang - baxter equation with spectral parameter .",
    "however it is a technically challenging task to undertake and has only been implemented explicitly for some low rank cases @xcite .    often , a more tractable approach is to start with a constant matrix solution of the yang - baxter equation and then ask the question of whether a spectral parameter - dependent generalisation exists , a procedure which is commonly referred to as _",
    "baxterisation_. for example , in cases where the solution of the yang - baxter equation without spectral parameter affords a representation of the hecke algebra , there exists a procedure for constructing the associated spectral parameter - dependent solution @xcite .",
    "this also applies in cases where the constant solution gives rise to a representation of the birman - wenzl - murakami algebra @xcite . for solutions associated with representations of quantum algebras , a general prescription for baxterising constant solutions of the yang - baxter equation ( subject to satisfying certain conditions )",
    "was developed in @xcite using the notion of the _ tensor product graph _ method .",
    "an alternative route to building solutions of the yang - baxter equation is in the framework of descendants .",
    "the most notable instances were found by bazhanov and stroganov @xcite , who showed that the chiral potts model is a descendant of the six - vertex model , and hasegawa and yamada @xcite , who showed that the kashiwara - miwa model is a descendant of the zero - field eight - vertex model . in both cases",
    "the connection was found by constructing an appropriate algebraic structure through an @xmath6-operator . in @xcite",
    "the algebraic structure is closely related to that of the quantum algebra @xmath7 with @xmath8 a root of unity , and in @xcite the @xmath6-operator is expressed in terms of the sklyanin algebra @xcite . in this approach use of the @xmath6-operator",
    "allows for the construction of descendants through higher dimensional representations of the algebra .",
    "it is known @xcite that the six - vertex and the zero - field eight - vertex models intersect at the zero - field six - vertex model whose descendant is the fateev - zamolodchikov model @xcite , which is precisely the intersection between the chiral potts and kashiwara - miwa models .",
    "another principal class of quasi - triangular hopf algebras is the class of drinfeld doubles of finite group algebras .",
    "these algebras have recently received attention in relation to the description of anyonic symmetries in quantum systems , specifically in terms of the braiding properties of anyonic quasiparticle excitations which are described by constant solutions of the yang - baxter equation @xcite .",
    "however these algebras these have not been investigated in the context of solving the yang - baxter equation with spectral parameter , apart from some preliminary investigations reported in @xcite .",
    "arguably the simplest family of drinfeld double algebras for finite groups is that associated with the dihedral groups , denoted @xmath9 .",
    "the drinfeld doubles of these algebras , denoted @xmath10 , are finite - dimensional quasi - triangular hopf algebras with a finite number of irreducible representations . for @xmath10 all the irreducible representations are known @xcite . in the case where @xmath11 is odd , the irreducible representations can only have dimensions 1 , 2 or @xmath11 , whereas for @xmath11 even the dimensions are 1 , 2 or @xmath12 .",
    "the constant @xmath5-matrices associated with the 2-dimensional representations can be baxterised to reproduce the six - vertex model at roots of unity @xcite .",
    "our goal below is to obtain spectral parameter - dependent solutions of the yang - baxter equation associated with the @xmath11-dimensional ( @xmath11 odd ) and @xmath12-dimensional ( @xmath11 even ) representations .",
    "the general strategy we follow is to view these solutions as descendants of the six - vertex model , by firstly determining the appropriate @xmath6-operators .",
    "once this is achieved , the technical aspects for determining the explicit form of the descendants is accommodated by adapting the tensor product graph method developed for quantum algebras @xcite to the present case .",
    "it turns out that solutions we obtain for @xmath11 odd are limiting cases of the fateev - zamolodchikov models @xcite .",
    "however we stress that the anticipated @xmath7 symmetry with @xmath8 a root of unity degenerates in this limit , with the @xmath10 symmetry emerging .",
    "we first define some notation which is used extensively throughout this article .",
    "we often work modulo @xmath13 , and hence define the following map : given @xmath14 then @xmath15 is the integer which satisfies @xmath16 .",
    "we also use the following two delta functions :    @xmath17    we use @xmath18 to denote an elementary matrix in @xmath19 whose indices are considered modulo @xmath11 .",
    "we adopt the convention that @xmath20 corresponds to the matrix with an entry in the @xmath11th row and @xmath11th column .",
    "these matrices obey the relation @xmath21    we use the following convention for the product symbol : @xmath22      we will use three variants of the yang - baxter equation ( ybe ) , which is a non - linear matrix equation in @xmath23 for some vector space @xmath24 .",
    "the first of these forms we call the constant ybe , given by @xmath25 where the subscripts of @xmath5 refer to which vector spaces the operator is acting upon .",
    "that is , given @xmath26 we have @xmath27 here @xmath28 denotes the identity matrix .",
    "the second form is known as the spectral parameter - dependent ybe and is given by    @xmath29    where @xmath30 .",
    "given a parameter - dependent solution , @xmath31 , constant solutions are recovered when we take the limits @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we refer to invertible solutions of either form as _ @xmath5-matrices_. as this article deals primarily with the parameter - dependent ybe we shall henceforth refer to it simply as the yang - baxter equation .",
    "now suppose @xmath34 and @xmath35 are @xmath5-matrices with @xmath36 .",
    "we describe @xmath31 as a _ descendant _ of @xmath37 provided that there exists a non - trivial invertible operator @xmath38 ( referred to as an _",
    "@xmath6-operator _ ) which satisfies @xmath39 and @xmath40    in this article we start with an @xmath5-matrix associated with the zero - field six - vertex model and use the drinfeld doubles of dihedral groups to generate @xmath6-operators and descendants . the third variant of the ybe used in this paper is @xmath41 given a matrix solution @xmath31 to equation , a solution to this form of the ybe is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the permutation operator , i.e. @xmath44      next we recall relevant results from the drinfeld double construction applied to finite group algebras , following @xcite .",
    "given a group @xmath45 , with identity @xmath46 , we consider the algebra @xmath47 , whose basis vectors are the elements of the group .",
    "the multiplication and unit of @xmath47 are inherited from the group in the natural way .",
    "we equip @xmath47 with a coproduct , counit and antipode defined respectively by @xmath48 with these maps @xmath47 becomes a hopf algebra .",
    "we next consider the dual space of @xmath47 , @xmath49 the multiplication and unit are given , respectively , by @xmath50 the costructure and antipode are defined by @xmath51 under these maps @xmath52 is also a hopf algebra . using the dual and the original algebra we can construct the drinfeld double , @xmath53 we impose the relation @xmath54 and adopt the required remaining structure from @xmath47 and @xmath52 .",
    "furthermore it is known that @xmath55 is a quasi - triangular hopf algebra , containing the canonical element @xmath56 this element satisfies the following relations : @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the opposite coproduct .",
    "consequently matrix representations of @xmath59 provide solutions of the constant yang - baxter equation .",
    "in this paper we use the dihedral group @xmath9 , which is the symmetry group of a regular polygon with @xmath11 vertices .",
    "that is , @xmath60 and has order @xmath61 . for ease of calculation",
    "we divide the description of the representation theory into different cases .",
    "we first consider @xmath62 for the case where @xmath11 is odd . as stated in @xcite the representations of the double of a group are naturally partitioned by the conjugacy classes of the group . for these representations",
    "we consider @xmath63 to be a primitive @xmath11th root of unity .",
