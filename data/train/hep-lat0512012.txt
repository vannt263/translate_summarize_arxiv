    "a key ingredient in many high - precision applications of lattice qcd is the use of perturbation theory , in order to match lattice discretizations of actions and observables to their counterparts in continuum qcd .",
    "an important example is the determination of the strong coupling @xmath0 , where perturbative expansions of short - distance quantities , such as small wilson loops , can be used to extract the value of the coupling from simulation measurements @xcite .",
    "lattice perturbation theory by feynman diagram analysis is extremely difficult however , because the lattice regulator results in feynman rules that are exceedingly complicated ; moreover , there is a proliferation of diagrams that are not present in the continuum .",
    "a further challenge is that these perturbative - matching calculations must generally be carried out at next - to - next - to - leading order ( `` nnlo , '' which is generally equivalent to two - loop feynman diagrams ) , if one is to obtain results of a few - percent precision @xcite .",
    "although many parts of diagrammatic lattice perturbation theory have been automated with the help of computer codes @xcite , higher - order calculations remain very challenging , and very few nnlo lattice calculations have been done ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the algebraic burden is particularly heavy for the highly - improved actions that are now commonly used in numerical simulations .",
    "a particularly important case is the tree - level @xmath1-improved staggered - quark action ( where @xmath2 is the lattice spacing ) @xcite , together with the @xmath1-accurate and one - loop symanzik - improved gluon action @xcite , both of which are tadpole improved ( and which are hereafter collectively referred to as the `` asqtad '' actions ) .",
    "the `` asqtad '' actions are currently being used by the milc collaboration to generate unquenched ensembles with three - flavors of sea quarks @xcite , which have been used by several groups for a wide variety of physics applications , including quantities requiring higher - order perturbation theory @xcite .    given the central role of perturbative matching in lattice qcd , alternatives to diagrammatic perturbation theory are desirable .",
    "one approach @xcite is to use monte carlo simulations at weak couplings , where the theory enters the perturbative phase ( at finite volume ) .",
    "simulation measurements of a particular observable are done at several values of the coupling , and the resulting data are fit to an expansion in the coupling ; the fit yields numerical values for the perturbative coefficients , without feynman diagrams , and with little or no analytic input .",
    "this monte carlo approach has been successful in computing the perturbation series of a number of quantities in pure gauge theories @xcite .",
    "in particular , perturbative coefficients for a number of small wilson loops for the plaquette gluon action were computed to nnlo using this method in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the results were subsequently reproduced by diagrammatic perturbation theory ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we make the first applications of this monte carlo method to lattice actions with dynamical fermions @xcite .",
    "the perturbation series of a number of small wilson loops are computed through nnlo , for two different lattice qcd actions with dynamical staggered quarks : the wilson plaquette gluon action with the unimproved - staggered quark action , and the `` asqtad '' actions .",
    "the latter calculation is of particular relevance because it provides a consistency check of the nnlo wilson loop expansions used in the determination of @xmath0 by the hpqcd collaboration , in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we note that another simulation approach to lattice perturbation theory has also been developed , based on an explicit perturbative expansion of the simulation equations themselves @xcite , and has recently been applied to ( unimproved ) lattice actions with dynamical fermions @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo method considered here has the advantage that it can be done using conventional simulation codes , although it is very advantageous to adopt twisted boundary conditions ( tbc ) @xcite in order to eliminate zero modes , and to suppress nonperturbative finite - volume effects due to transitions between @xmath3 phases @xcite ; fortunately , tbc can be implemented in existing simulation codes with relatively little effort .",
    "this simulation approach to unquenched perturbation theory is also very efficient , since the simulations can be done on very small lattices ( @xmath4 volumes are used here ) , thanks to the use of tbc .",
    "the simulations are also done here for different numbers @xmath5 of dynamical fermions , which explicitly demonstrates that the data are sensitive to the @xmath5-dependence of the perturbative coefficients .",
    "although small wilson loops are the simplest observables for perturbative analysis by monte carlo simulations , because they are such ultraviolet quantities ( as well as being gauge invariant ) , the studies presented here nonetheless provide important benchmarks for future applications to other quantities ; for instance , similar methods were used to analyze the static - quark propagator in pure - gauge backgrounds in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the fermilab heavy - quark propagator was analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "while the expansion coefficients can be extracted with far less effort from monte carlo simulations , care must be taken to control all of the systematic uncertainties , in order to reliably extract the small part of the signal corresponding to the higher - order terms in the perturbative expansion .",
    "it is also crucial to use an expansion in a renormalized coupling , rather than in the bare lattice coupling @xmath6 , for which perturbation theory is very poorly convergent @xcite .",
    "we use an expansion in the coupling @xmath7 defined by the static potential , along with an estimate of the optimal scale @xmath8 for a given quantity @xcite .",
    "although one can in principle define the renormalized coupling @xmath9 at a given bare lattice coupling @xmath10 from simulation measurements of the static potential , we rely here instead on existing nnlo determinations of the relationship from diagrammatic perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "we did simulations at couplings @xmath11 , hence statistical and systematic errors must be much less than @xmath12 , for determination of the third - order coefficients .",
    "the ensemble sizes were chosen in order to reduce the statistical errors to the desired level .",
    "there are four major sources of systematic error in the simulation algorithms and in the data analysis : i ) transitions between the @xmath3 center phases of the gauge field action ; ii ) finite step - size errors in the simulation equations ; iii ) other algorithmic systematics , such as the precision of the matrix inversion ; and iv ) fitting and truncation errors in the perturbative expansion .    in this study simulations",
    "were done with tbc to suppress transition between the center phases , as indicated above . to eliminate the finite step - size errors we pursued one of two strategies : in the case of the unimproved actions",
    ", we used the rational hybrid monte carlo algorithm ( rhmc )  @xcite ; for the `` asqtad '' actions we used the @xmath13 algorithm @xcite , and did simulations at several different molecular - dynamics step sizes , the results of which were extrapolated to zero step size . to extract the perturbative coefficients",
    "the data were analyzed using constrained curve fitting techniques @xcite , which provide an elegant procedure for incorporating our _ a priori _ expectation that the perturbative expansion is well behaved , and which readily allow the maximum amount of information to be extracted from the data .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . the actions and simulation parameters",
    "are detailed in sect .",
    "[ s : actions ] , along with the perturbation theory input which we use to extract the renormalized coupling @xmath9 at a given bare lattice coupling , from the simulation data .",
    "a detailed analysis of the systematic uncertainties is presented in sect .",
    "[ s : systematics ] , including the use of tbc to control finite - volume effects .",
    "results for the two actions are reported in sect .",
    "[ s : results ] , and are compared with nnlo diagrammatic perturbation theory .",
    "conclusions and prospects for further work are presented in sect .",
    "[ s : conclusions ] .",
    "we have done unquenched simulations for two sets of actions : the first set used the unimproved wilson plaquette action with unimproved - staggered fermions , while the second set used @xmath1-improved gluon and staggered - quark actions .",
    "we provide the simulation parameters and perturbation theory input for each set of actions in the two following subsections .",
    "a basic input parameter for the simulations is the bare lattice coupling @xmath14 , related to the usual simulation parameter @xmath15 in the case of the wilson plaquette action , for example , according to @xmath16 .",
    "however the bare coupling is not suitable for perturbative expansions @xcite and we use instead a renormalized coupling @xmath17 , defined by the static potential according to @xcite @xmath18 a ( truncated ) perturbative expansion for the logarithm of a wilson loop of size @xmath19 is used , owing to the perturbative perimeter law , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the order at which the series is truncated .",
    "we aim to measure the coefficients through third - order , hence fits must be done with @xmath22 .",
    "the characteristic scale @xmath23 for each observable is determined according to the blm method ( which estimates the typical momentum carried by a gluon in leading - order diagrams ) @xcite .",
    "the connection between the simulation input @xmath10 and the @xmath9 coupling is therefore required .",
    "although it is possible , in principle , to extract this relation by directly measuring the static - quark potential in monte carlo simulations , the connection has already been computed in diagrammatic perturbation theory through nnlo for a variety of actions , including those we consider here , in ref .",
    "we use the results of ref .",
    "@xcite to provide the three leading orders of the expansion for the @xmath24 plaquette , as well as the scales @xmath23 for all the wilson loops ( the later only requires a relatively straightforward one - loop calculation ) .",
    "the diagrammatic input provided by the expansion of the @xmath25 loop simplifies our analysis , and still allows for highly - nontrivial applications of the monte carlo method ; here we demonstrate the utility of the method by computing the nnlo perturbative expansions of several larger wilson loops , and thereby also provide a valuable consistency check of the nnlo diagrammatic calculations which were used to obtain @xmath0 in refs .",
    "@xcite .    given this input from diagrammatic perturbation theory",
    ", the monte carlo method proceeds as follows .",
    "simulations are done at several small values of the bare coupling @xmath10 ( at which the lattice theory is in the perturbative phase at a given finite volume ) . for each bare coupling one measures the average plaquette @xmath26 , whose perturbative expansion is assumed , and the quantities of interest , whose perturbative expansions are to be determined ; in our case these latter quantities are larger wilson loops , @xmath27 .",
    "the numerical value of the renormalized coupling @xmath28 at the scale @xmath29 is obtained by substituting the measured value @xmath26 into its known third - order expansion .",
    "once the numerical value of @xmath30 has been determined , the couplings at the other relevant scales @xmath23 can be computed using the universal second - order beta function , plus the known third - order correction in the @xmath31 scheme @xcite , according to    @xmath32}{\\ln(q^2/\\lambda_v^2 ) }     + \\frac{\\beta_1 ^ 2}{\\beta_0 ^ 4\\ln^2(q^2/\\lambda_v^2 ) }     \\left ( \\left(\\ln\\left[\\ln(q^2/\\lambda_v^2)\\right ] -\\frac12 \\right)^2       + \\frac{\\beta_{2v}\\beta_0}{\\beta_1 ^ 2 } -\\frac54 \\right)\\right ] ,   \\label{lambdav}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath33 is traded for the intrinsic scale @xmath34 at the given bare coupling .",
    "the beta - function coefficients are @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "fits to the expansion eq .",

    "as discussed in sect .",
    "[ s : fitting ] , excellent agreement with diagrammatic calculations is obtained , within the fit errors , which for @xmath60 are typically a few parts in @xmath63 , and for @xmath61 are typically a few percent .",

    "also clearly resolve the perturbative dependence on the number of flavors , which in the case of @xmath61 shows a change of 34 standard deviations from @xmath64 to @xmath65 .",
    "the accuracy of the monte carlo results for the higher - order coefficients can be dramatically improved by further constraining the lower - order terms using available diagrammatic input .",
    "results are shown in table  [ unimpc23 ] where we first fix @xmath60 to its diagrammatic value , and then fix both @xmath60 and @xmath61 ; in the first case , the fit errors in @xmath61 and @xmath62 are reduced by factors of about 23 compared to the results in table  [ unimpc123 ] , while in the second case the errors in @xmath62 are reduced by a factor of about 5 .",

    "the results also show that the monte carlo perturbation theory is clearly sensitive to the number of dynamical fermion .",
    "furthermore , when the two leading perturbative coefficients were constrained to their diagrammatic values , the third - order term was obtained with a precision comparable to that from the nnlo diagrammatic analysis @xcite , which required the evaluation of about fifty feynman diagrams .",
    "these results provide a stringent test of the monte carlo method as applied to highly - improved lattice actions with dynamical fermions , and also provide an important high - precision cross - check of the perturbation theory input to a recent determination of @xmath0 by the hpqcd collaboration @xcite .",
    "remarkably little computational power was needed , since the simulations were done on small volumes ( @xmath4 ) , thanks to the use of twisted boundary conditions , which eliminate lattice zero modes , and which suppress other finite - volume effects ; the entire set of simulations for the `` asqtad '' actions only required the equivalent of about 60 months of run - time on a single 3  ghz processor .",
    "larger lattices might be needed for other quantities , such as quark propagators @xcite , that are not as dominated by ultraviolet modes as the small wilson loops analyzed here , though an earlier study for pure - gauge theories @xcite found that finite - volume effects in such quantities could be removed by working on several relatively small volumes .",
