    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , mainly emitting radiation in the gamma - ray waveband which lasts a few seconds , and may be followed by the @xmath0-ray , optical or radio emissions lasting a few days , are the most energetic explosions in the universe @xcite .",
    "the recent decades have seen great successes in understanding the nature of grbs thanks to the contribution by various space experiments .",
    "the isotropic distribution in the sky strongly implies that grbs happen in the deep universe @xcite . the cosmological origin of grbs",
    "was eventually confirmed starting form 1997 thanks to the combination of accurate localizations by bepposax and redshift measurements from the follow - up observation with the main optical / ir facilities .",
    "the furthest grb observed at present has redshift @xmath1 @xcite , and the total isotropic equivalent radiated energy by a grb is about @xmath2 ergs @xcite .",
    "the durations of grbs span about six orders of magnitude , from milliseconds for the shortest to thousands of seconds for the longest .",
    "it is widely accepted that grbs can be divided into two classes according to the duration , because the histogram of duration is fitted well by the summation of two gauss functions separated at around 2 seconds @xcite .",
    "therefore , short and long grbs are classified depending on whether the duration is shorter or longer than 2 seconds .",
    "the light curves of grbs have various type , from smoothly decaying to highly variable with many spikes @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of a typical grb can be well fitted by the band function @xcite , which is a two smoothly jointed power lows cutting at a breaking energy .",
    "below the breaking energy , the band function reduces to the cut - off power law ( cpl ) , and above the breaking energy , it is the simple power law ( pl )",
    ". however , some detectors such as the swift - bat , work in an energy band well below or just near the breaking energy .",
    "therefore , it is enough to fit the spectra just with the simple pl , and the high - energy power - law index of the band function could nt be constrained .",
    "since the first linear correlation between the spectral lag and the isotropic peak luminosity ( @xmath3 relation ) was found by @xcite , several other empirical correlations have been found .",
    "these empirical correlations relate the luminosity to the spectral parameters of grbs .",
    "one of the most famous correlation was found by @xcite .",
    "the amati relation is a linear ( in the logarithmic scale ) correlation between the isotropic equivalent energy and the peak energy of @xmath4 spectra ( @xmath5 relation ) .",
    "later , @xcite found a similar correlation between the isotropic peak luminosity and the peak energy ( @xmath6 relation ) .",
    "other two - parameter luminosity correlations includes : @xmath7 relation @xcite , @xmath8 relation @xcite , @xmath9 relation @xcite , and so on . besides , there are also three - parameter correlations such as @xmath10 relation @xcite , @xmath11 relation @xcite , @xmath12 relation @xcite , @xmath13 relation @xcite .",
    "some luminosity correlations are only valid for long grbs , while others are valid for both short and long grbs .",
    "these correlations are often used to calibrate grbs as the standard candles and to reconstruct the grb hubble diagram @xcite .",
    "the above luminosity correlations involve three quantities , i.e. , the isotropic equivalent energy @xmath14 , the isotropic peak luminosity @xmath15 and the spectral peak energy @xmath16 .",
    "the derivation of the first two quantities involves the integration of spectra over the  bolometric \" @xmath17 kev energy band .",
    "however , most detectors such as swift - bat only measure photons in a narrow energy band .",
    "therefore , we should extrapolate the observed spectra to the whole energy band .",
    "most previous works calculated @xmath14 and @xmath15 by assuming that the spectra are modeled by the band function . due to the narrow energy width of detectors , cpl ( or even pl ) is enough to fit the observed spectra , and the high - energy index ( @xmath18 ) of the band function ca nt be constrained .",
    "@xcite fixed @xmath18 to be @xmath19 for all the grbs that have no measured @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , about @xmath20 ( @xmath21 out of @xmath22 ) grbs compiled in @xcite have no measurement of @xmath18 .",
    "the following works @xcite which cited the data from @xcite also have the underling assumption that the unmeasured @xmath18 s are all set to be @xmath19 .",
    "it is especially necessary to check such a setting has some influence on the final luminosity correlations . using 29 swift grbs",
    ", @xcite found that the zero - point of amati relation calculated from cpl is slightly larger than that from band function , while the intercept does not change significantly .",
    "the small change of zero - point of amati relation may have some influences on the calibration of grbs .    in this paper , we investigate if the luminosity correlations are affected by the choice of grb spectra .",
    "we search the most up - to - date swift data archive and find that among @xmath23 grbs which have redshift measurement , only 44 grbs can be well fitted by cpl so have well defined peak energy . using the 44 grbs , we study the @xmath5 correlation and @xmath6 correlation .",
    "all the 44 grbs are fitted by cpl so the high - energy index could nt be determined .",
    "therefore , we calculate @xmath14 and @xmath15 by using the cpl instead of the band function . to comparison , we also calculate @xmath14 and @xmath15 using the band function , with the high - energy index fixed to be @xmath19 , the median value of batse grbs @xcite , as was done by @xcite .",
    "we further calibrate the distance of grbs using these two luminosity correlations respectively , and reconstruct grb hubble diagram .",
    "we investigate the influence of different spectra on the luminosity correlations and on the reconstruction of grb hubble diagram . throughout this paper",
    ", we assume the concordance cosmological model with the fiducial parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the rest of this paper is arranged as follows : in section [ sec : observation ] , we present the observational properties of 44 swift - bat grbs used in our analysis . in section [ sec :",
    "correlation ] , we investigate the @xmath5 relation and @xmath6 relation by assuming that the grb spectrum is modeled by band function and cpl , respectively , and compare their differences .",
    "we also implement monte carlo simulations to test the sensitivity of luminosity correlations on the high - energy power - law index . in section [ sec : hubble ] , we calibrate the distance of grbs through these two luminosity correlations , to see whether the resulting grb hubble diagram would depend on the choice of spectra .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to a short summary .",
    "the swift satellite , launched on november 20 , 2004 , is a first - of - its - kind multi - wavelength observatory dedicated to the study of grb science .",
    "there are three instruments onboard swift working together to observe grbs and afterglows in the gamma - ray , @xmath0-ray , ultraviolet , and optical wavebands .",
    "the burst alert telescope ( bat , @xmath27 kev ) , which is a highly sensitive and large field of view gamma - ray detector working in the energy band @xmath27 kev , detects grbs and accurately determines their positions on the sky . soon after the triggering of bat , the x - ray telescope ( xrt , @xmath28 kev ) and uv / optical telescope ( uvot , @xmath29 nm ) quickly repoint the field of view towards grbs and start the afterglow observation . with the rate of about 100 grbs per year , swift has observed about one thousand grbs until september , 2015 , and about 300 grbs have redshift measurement .    for most grbs ,",
    "the spectra can be well fitted by a two smoothly jointed power laws cutting at a breaking energy @xmath30 , which is well known as the band function @xcite , @xmath31 \\quad & e\\leq \\frac{\\alpha-\\beta}{2+\\alpha}e_p\\,,\\\\      be^{\\beta } \\quad & e>\\frac{\\alpha-\\beta}{2+\\alpha}e_p\\ , ,    \\end{dcases}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath18 are the low - energy and high - energy power - law index , respectively , and they vary from bursts to bursts . statistically , @xmath32 peaks around @xmath33 , and @xmath18 peaks around @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the band function is continuous and smooth at the breaking energy @xmath34 , and it is monotonously decreasing in the whole energy range .",
    "however , it is easy to prove that the @xmath35 spectrum has a peak at @xmath36 , for any @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath16 depends on the specific detectors . for the batse catalog , @xmath16 peaks around @xmath39 kev @xcite , while for the swift - bat catalog",
    ", @xmath16 is relatively lower @xcite .",
    "the band function was first proposed from analyzing the spectra of grbs observed by batse , which is a gamma - ray detector sensitive in a wide energy band @xmath40 kev .",
    "however , the swift - bat is only sensitive in a low and narrow energy band , which is just near or even below the typical breaking energy . therefore , the observed spectra by swift - bat can be fitted using the low - energy end of band function , i.e. , the cpl , @xmath41.\\ ] ] this is to say , the high - energy index @xmath18 ca nt be well constrained .",
    "the cpl is a special case of band function in the limit @xmath42 .",
    "figure [ fig : band ] shows the difference between the band function and cpl .",
    "cpl falls much more dramatically than band function above @xmath30 .        on the other hand ,",
    "since the swift - bat working energy band is very narrow , for majority of grbs we can even fit the spectra just with a simple pl , i.e. , @xmath43 the @xmath4 spectrum of cpl also peaks at @xmath16 , while pl is monotonous and has no peak .    among @xmath23 swift grbs with measured redshift ,",
    "only 44 grbs have a reasonable cpl fit so have well determined peak energy , while the remaining grbs can be fitted well by the simple pl . only these 44 grbs are available to analyze the luminosity correlations .",
    "we list the observational properties of the 44 grbs in table [ tab : parameters1 ] .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     among the 44 swift - bat grbs considered here , at least 24 of them are also observed by konus - wind @xcite or fermi - gbm @xcite .",
    "these two detectors can observe grbs in a much wider energy band ( 10 kev @xmath44 10 mev for konus - wind and 8 kev @xmath44 40 mev for fermi - gbm ) than swift - bat , making the detailed analysis of spectra possible .",
    "we list the spectral properties of these 24 grbs in table [ tab : parameters5 ] .",
    "the spectra of 10 grbs can be fitted to the band function , so that the high - energy index @xmath18 can be well constrained . for the remain 14 grbs",
    ", the spectra can only be fitted to cpl , and @xmath18 still cannt be constrained . in column ( 8) of table [ tab : parameters5 ] , we also list the isotropic - equivalent energy @xmath14 . for grbs which have well measured @xmath18 ,",
    "@xmath14 is calculated from the band model .",
    "otherwise , @xmath14 is calculated from the cpl model . with these 24 grbs",
    ", we calculate the amati relation and obtain parameters @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 . due to the narrow coverage of @xmath16 and the small sample ,",
    "the intrinsic scatter is large and the slope parameter could nt be well constrained .",
    "nevertheless , the slope still seems to be flatter than previous findings , but consistent with our results .",
    "it is not clearly understood why swift grbs have flatter slope .",
    "one reason may be that the peak energies measured by swift / bat have a relatively narrow distribution ( e.g. , most of @xmath48 s are between 50 and 500 kev ) , while the samples investigated previously cover at least 3 orders of magnitude in @xmath48 ( from a few kev to a few thousands kev ) .    to test the sensitivity of luminosity correlations on the high - energy power - law index @xmath18 , we implement the monte carlo simulations .",
    "we recalculate the amati relation in the case that grb spectra are modeled by the band function . in this time , @xmath18 is no longer fixed at @xmath19 , but it is a random number generated from the gauss distribution with average value @xmath19 and standard deviation @xmath49 to be smaller than @xmath50 , such that @xmath16 is well defined .",
    "this can be done by setting @xmath18 to its symmetrical value for any @xmath51 , i.e. , using @xmath52 instead of @xmath18 .",
    "the price is that the distribution of @xmath18 is not strictly gaussian . ] .",
    "we simulate 1000 times and derive the intercept and slope parameters @xmath53 of amati relation in each simulation .",
    "the histograms of @xmath54 and @xmath55 in 1000 simulations are plotted in figure [ fig : hist_ab ] .",
    "the distribution of both @xmath54 and @xmath55 can be well fitted by gauss function , with average values and standard deviations @xmath56 , @xmath57 ( @xmath58 c.l . ) , and @xmath59 , @xmath60 ( @xmath58 c.l . ) , respectively .",
    "this is consistent with the amati relation in both the cpl and band cases ( see table [ tab : parameters4 ] ) .",
    "the small standard deviations of @xmath54 and @xmath55 imply that the amati relation is insensitive to @xmath18 .",
    "since the yonetoku relation in the cpl cases does not much differ from that in the band case , we can expect that it is also insensitive to @xmath18 .",
    "both the amati relation and yonetoku relation have been widely used to calibrate the distance of grbs . here",
    "we take the amati relation as an example .",
    "the calibrating procedures are as follows : first , derive the best - fitting parameters ( @xmath61 ) of amati relation as discussed in the last section .",
    "second , calculate @xmath14 of each grb through eq.([eq : amati ] ) , by fixing ( @xmath61 ) at the best - fitting values .",
    "then the luminosity distance of each grb can be obtained through eq.([eq : iso_energy ] ) .",
    "finally , convert the luminosity distance to distance modulus , i.e. , @xmath62 the uncertainty of distance modulus is calculated using the formulae of error propagation @xcite , @xmath63,\\ ] ] where @xmath64 we can also calibrate grbs using the yonetoku relation in a very similar way .    we must point out that the calibrating method mentioned above has the circularity problem and is model dependent , because we have used the concordance cosmological model with fiducial parameters in the calibration .",
    "our paper is not aimed at solving this problem , but we are rather interested in studying the effect of grb spectra on the distance calibration . some model - independent methods free of circularity problem have been extensively discussed @xcite .    the distance moduli calibrated using the amati relation and yonetoku relation are listed in columns @xmath65 in table [ tab : parameters2 ] and table [ tab : parameters3 ] , respectively .",
    "we can see that the distance moduli only slightly depend on the choice of grb spectra .",
    "the difference between distance moduli in the two spectra cases ( band and cpl ) is much smaller than the uncertainties of distance moduli , i , e , @xmath66 . in figure [ fig : hubble1 ] , we plot the grb hubble diagram calibrated using amati relation .",
    "the top - left and top - right panels are the resulting hubble diagram in the cpl and band cases , respectively .",
    "the solid curves are the theoretical results of concordance @xmath67cdm model with fiducial parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in the bottle",
    "two panels of figure [ fig : hubble1 ] , we plot the residual of distance moduli with respect to the theoretical curve .",
    "the error bar represents @xmath68 uncertainty .",
    "grbs consistent ( inconsistent ) with theoretical curve within @xmath68 uncertainty are denoted by black ( red ) . due to the large intrinsic scatter of amati relation , 27% ( 12 out of 44 )",
    "grbs do not fall onto the theoretical curve within @xmath68 uncertainty .",
    "these grbs all have low redshift ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "grbs inconsistent with theoretical curve in the cpl case are still inconsistent in the band case .",
    "the uncertainty of distance modulus mainly ( @xmath70 ) propagates from the intrinsic scatter .",
    "a much tighter correlation with smaller intrinsic scatter is necessary to reduce @xmath71 .",
    "we also reconstruct the grb hubble diagram using the yonetoku relation and plot it in figure [ fig : hubble2 ] .",
    "compared to the hubble diagram reconstructed from amati relation , very similar conclusion can be draw .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the grb hubble diagram almost does not depend on the choice of grb spectra .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the effect of grb spectra on the luminosity correlations and grb hubble diagram .",
    "most previous works calculated the isotropic equivalent energy and peak luminosity by assuming that grb spectra are modeled by the band function .",
    "due to the narrow energy coverage of detectors , the high - energy power - law index of band function usually ca nt be constrained . using 44 swift grbs with well determined peak energy",
    ", we calculated two luminosity correlations ( amati relation and yonetoku relation ) in the cases that grb spectra are modeled by the band function and cpl , respectively .",
    "it is found that both amati relation and yonetoku relation only moderately depend on the choice of grb spectra .",
    "monte carlo simulations show that the amati relation is insensitive to the high - energy power - law index of band function .",
    "we further calibrated the distance of grbs using these two luminosity correlations and reconstructed the grb hubble diagram .",
    "we found that different grb spectra only cause the difference of distance modulus at the order of 0.1 mag , while the uncertainty of distance modulus calibrated using luminosity correlations are usually larger than 1.0 mag .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that the resulting grb hubble diagram is insensitive to the choice of grb spectra .",
