    "coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) are a major form of solar activity in the corona .",
    "a cme takes @xmath0 g of plasma from the low corona into the solar wind to disturb the near - earth space if the cme propagation is directed toward us .",
    "unlike other solar activities such as flares and filament eruptions , cmes were only first observed when white light coronagraphs were put into space in the 1970s ( macqueen et al .",
    "1974 , howard 1976 ) .",
    "since then , this astrophysical process has caught much attention in the space physics community because of the adverse consequences of cmes for orbiting satellites .",
    "cmes are identified as large - scale bright features in white light that move outward through the corona at speeds from 10 to over 2000 km / s ( hundhausen 1999 ) .",
    "these are impressive dynamical phenomena that we happen to be able to observe with a certain degree of completeness in both white light ( dere et al .",
    "1999 , st .",
    "cyr et al .",
    "2000 , burkepile et al . 2004 ) as well as in x - ray and euv bands ( webb & hundhausen 1987 , hudson & cliver 2001 ) . in a low-@xmath1 plasma system on the large scales of the corona , we generally believe that mhd processes control the dynamical evolution of the magnetic field and the coronal plasma . in considering cmes as a mhd phenomena ,",
    "previous studies have mainly focused on two physical issues : magnetic energy storage and cme initiation .",
    "the energy storage problem is concerned with how much free magnetic energy can be stored in the corona in order for the field to spontaneously open up to infinity during a cme eruption .",
    "this issue was first brought up in aly ( 1984 ) , and later on in aly ( 1991 ) and sturrock ( 1991 ) , where aly conjectured that a fully - anchored force - free field may not be able to store enough free magnetic energy to drive a cme kinematically , in addition to opening up the field under conditions of high electrical conductivity .",
    "this conjecture states that an anchored force - free field can not store more energy than that of any fully - open field sharing the same boundary flux distribution at the base of the atmosphere , where those fully - open fields have energies bounded from below by a minimum usually referred to as the aly limit .",
    "many studies have pointed out that the constraint of the aly conjecture can be bypassed by relieving one of the conditions assumed in the conjecture .",
    "for example , by relieving the force - free condition an equilibrium field with plasma weight can easily store enough free magnetic energy to drive the cme ( low & smith 1993 , wolfson & dlamini 1997 , fong et al .",
    "2002 , low et al .",
    "2003 , zhang & low 2004 , flyer et al .",
    "2005 ) . even under the force - free condition",
    ", recent studies have showed that the aly limit can be exceeded if the field contains a detached magnetic flux rope in the corona ( hu et al .",
    "2003 , wolfson 2003 , flyer et al .",
    "2004 ) . the aly conjecture can also be bypassed through the topology of multipolar fields . for multipolar fields ,",
    "a cme - like expulsion only needs to open up one but not all the bipolar fields ( antiochos et al .",
    "in such a situation , the aly limit associated with opening up the entire field is not the relevant energy threshold ; see zhang & low ( 2001 ) for illustrative examples .",
    "the cme initiation problem is concerned with the sporadic behavior and locations of cme occurrences .",
    "cmes are occurring at an average rate of one to three events per day , with the frequency of occurrence increasing as solar activity intensifies .",
    "the catastrophe model ( forbes & isenberg 1991 , isenberg , forbes & demoulin 1993 ) interprets the cme initiation as a catastrophic loss of equilibrium in a series of quasi - static evolution of magnetic equilibria corresponding to mathematical variations of some model parameters .",
    "the flux - emergence trigger model ( chen & shibata 2000 ) proposes that the newly - emerged flux near a preexisting flux rope is the trigger of the expulsion .",
    "it might be useful to point out that when we address the magnetic energy storage problem or the cme initiation problem , our underlying thinking tends to take these as two independent issues .",
    "however , as we have pointed out in a recent review ( zhang & low 2005 ) these two issues can be related by the accumulation of magnetic helicity in the corona as a fundamental mhd process .",
    "the accumulation of magnetic helicity in the corona leads to a magnetic energy build - up as a natural product of coronal evolution .",
    "eruptions , as a loss of field confinement , occur when the stored magnetic energy exceeds the aly limit . in this paper , we take another approach to address the role of magnetic helicity accumulation in the corona .",
    "we propose a hydromagnetic conjecture that there is an upper bound on the total magnetic helicity that a force - free field can contain , owing to the fact that a force - free field in an open atmosphere has to self - confine .",
    "this conjecture poses a fundamental but mathematically challenging problem in magnetohydrodynamics .",
    "we focus our attention in this paper on demonstrating the physical plausibility of the conjecture by using several families of numerical solutions of nonlinear force - free fields to make our physical points .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  2 , the physical considerations on the roles of magnetic helicity accumulation are addressed , with a particular focus on their connections to the magnetic energy storage and cme initiation . in  3 , power - law axisymmetric force - free fields are used to indicate the possible existence of an upper bound on the total magnetic helicity , using both analytical inequalities and numerical solutions .",
    "conclusions and discussions are presented in  4 .",
    "magnetic helicity is defined as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the vector potential of the vector magnetic field @xmath4 in a volume @xmath5 .",
    "it is a physical quantity that quantitatively measures the topological complexity of a magnetic field , such as the degree of linkage and/or twistedness in the field , provided @xmath5 wholly contains @xmath4 .",
    "we henceforth refer to @xmath5 as a a magnetic volume . with this physical quantity , the frozen - in condition in a perfectly conducting plasma",
    "can then be stated in terms of the absolute conservation of magnetic helicity in all magnetic sub - volumes as well as of the total magnetic helicity for the whole magnetic volume ( moffatt 1985 , see zhang & low 2005 for more descriptions ) .",
    "in a situation of a domain @xmath5 whose magnetic field @xmath4 threads across its boundary , i.e. , the normal magnetic field @xmath6 does not vanish across the domain boundary @xmath7 , @xmath8 is then gauge dependent and is therefore not physical .",
    "magnetic twist and linkage in @xmath5 then must be described by the relative magnetic helicity denoted by @xmath9 introduced by berger & field ( 1984 ) .",
    "we will define @xmath9 later with the development of the paper . in this paper",
    ", we take magnetic helicity to mean either @xmath8 or @xmath9 , depending on whichever applies to the given situation .",
    "the frozen - in condition , or the absolute conservation of magnetic helicity in magnetic volumes , must break down in a realistic plasma where the electrical conductivity is very high but not infinite .",
    "electric current sheets can form , and magnetic reconnection will subsequently set in , to dissipate the thin current sheets and change field topology ( parker 1994 ) . however , by a general scaling analysis of resistive processes , berger ( 1984 ) pointed out that the dissipation rate of the total relative magnetic helicity in the corona is orders of magnitude smaller than the release rate of magnetic energy .",
    "so the total magnetic helicity in the corona is still approximately conserved despite the occurrences of magnetic reconnection .",
    "the conservation of total magnetic helicity in the corona has a profound influence on the coronal dynamics .",
    "magnetic helicity is continuously being transported into the corona ( kurokawa 1987 , lites et al .",
    "1995 , leka et al .",
    "1996 , zhang 2001 , pevtsov , maleev & longcope 2003 ) with a preferred sign for the two solar hemispheres , positive and negative in the southern and northern hemisphere , respectively ( rust 1994 , pevtsov , canfield & metcalf 1995 , bao & zhang 1998 ) .",
    "moreover , the same opposite signs of helicity are statistically preferred in the two respective hemispheres , negative and positive , respectively , in the northern and southern hemispheres , independent of the solar cycle .",
    "thus , under the approximate conservation of total magnetic helicity , the hemispherical preferred signs of helicity implies an accumulation of magnetic helicity in the two hemispheres .",
    "it is this accumulated helicity that , we propose , characterizes the build up of magnetic - energy and when accumulated to a point a magnetic field must open up as an eruption .      for a force - free field confined in a finite domain with rigid walls",
    ", its total magnetic energy can exceed any value by endowing the field with a sufficiently twisted topology .",
    "this can be easily seen from the virial theorem of chandrasekhar ( 1961 ) , which states that for a force - free field confined in a sphere of radius @xmath10 , its total magnetic energy , given in spherical coordinates , is @xmath11 for a fixed boundary flux @xmath12 at @xmath10 , the more highly twisted the force - free field is , the greater are the boundary values of the tangential components @xmath13 and @xmath14 at @xmath10 , leading to a higher total magnetic energy of the field .",
    "note that force - free solutions can exist in such a domain even if @xmath15 on @xmath10 .",
    "more importantly , if the field is given a total non - zero magnetic helicity @xmath16 , woltjer ( 1958 ) theorem sets a ground - level energy above that of the potential field .",
    "the woltjer theorem produces many constant @xmath17 force - free fields , each being a local minimum - energy state compared to neighboring fields with the same total magnetic helicity @xmath16 .",
    "the absolutely lowest minimum - energy state , taken from among all those constant @xmath17 force - free fields , is called the woltjer state , characterized by a specific constant @xmath18 .",
    "this constant @xmath18 of the woltjer state , together with the given total magnetic helicity @xmath16 , puts a bound from below for the magnetic energy of the field in a finite domain .",
    "that is , the magnetic energy of any field @xmath4 possessing the same total magnetic helicity of @xmath16 satisfies the bound : @xmath19    applying this theorem to a coronal magnetic field underlying a locally confined coronal structure ( zhang & low 2003 ) , we can see that the coronal field can not relax to a potential state as long as the total magnetic helicity is not zero .",
    "magnetic reconnection may set in to release the excess magnetic energy that the coronal field may happen to have , but the field can not relax to a state that possesses less magnetic energy than that of the woltjer state . with more and more magnetic helicity brought with a preferred sign into the corona , this ground - level magnetic energy increases with the increasingly accumulated helicity .",
    "this is the principal consideration described in zhang & low ( 2005 ) of the role of the accumulated magnetic helicity in storing magnetic energy for cmes .      for a force - free field filling an unbounded atmosphere",
    ", it has an energy property that is distinct from the one confined in a finite domain with rigid walls .",
    "now , the virial theorem of chandrasekhar ( 1961 ) takes a different form and sets a special condition for those fields in force - free equilibrium . for a force - free field outside a sphere of radius @xmath10 in spherical coordinates , its total magnetic energy now takes the form of @xmath20 where we assume that @xmath21 spatially decline to zero at @xmath22 so that the total magnetic energy @xmath23 is finite . here and elsewhere",
    "we assume this is the case whenever we treat integration over unbounded domain without explicitly stating this qualification .",
    "since @xmath23 should always be positive , the above equation says that no force - free state is possible in @xmath24 domain unless @xmath25 on @xmath10 . with @xmath25 , equation",
    "( 3 ) sets an absolute upper bound on the total magnetic energy , @xmath26 which is uniquely determined by the flux distribution on @xmath10 , independent of the twist of the field .",
    "the essence of this hydromagnetic result is that there is an upper bound on the total magnetic energy that a force - free field can attain and this upper bound is determined by its boundary flux at @xmath10 .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that a force - free field in an unbounded atmosphere requires certain means of confinement to remain in equilibrium .",
    "the field with with an arbitrarily large , prescribed degree of twist may not be able to find a force - free state to meet the bound on its total magnetic energy .",
    "this is indicated by the the following analysis .    a field completely detached from @xmath10 , as drawn in figure 1b where @xmath27 , can never be in equilibrium in the absence of other body forces .",
    "the only way to hold a flux rope , and hence attain a certain amount of magnetic helicity in the low corona , is to add a @xmath25 field as in figure 1a to function as an anchoring agent",
    ". the resultant configuration will be the one sketched in figure 1c , a field containing a certain amount of magnetic helicity and yet finding equilibrium in the @xmath24 domain .",
    "now imagine we fix the @xmath12 distribution on @xmath10 in figure 1c but arbitrarily increase the total azimuthal flux in the flux rope .",
    "this parametric change will take the field closer and closer to the configuration in figure 1b .",
    "we intuitively expect that there would be a parameter representing the field topology crossing over where no force - free equilibrium can exist .",
    "we suggest that this critical parameter corresponds to a point of maximum accumulation of magnetic helicity in the atmosphere .",
    "this conjecture intuitively comes from the understanding that the total magnetic helicity can not be destroyed in the corona at observable time scales .",
    "so the corona may thus get a chance to accumulate magnetic helicity of a preferred sign to cross over a threshold bounding the allowable total helicity in a force - free field . a rigorous mathematical bound on the total helicity of a force - free field in @xmath24 , in full generality ,",
    "is needed to prove the conjecture , in parallel to equation ( 3 ) for the bound on the total energy of a force - free field .",
    "this is a difficult task in mathematical physics . as a first step towards such a proof , we use families of power - law axisymmetric force - free fields of flyer et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to investigate the nature of this conjecture .",
    "we focus the rest of our paper on such a study in order to provide a basic understanding of the physical issues .",
    "we first derive a formula to calculate the total relative magnetic helicity in axisymmetric magnetic fields .",
    "this simple formula is limited to axisymmetric fields but is otherwise quite general , independent of whether the axisymmetric field is in equilibrium or not .",

    "application of this relation with @xmath31 given by equation ( 7 ) for an axisymmetric field shows that the function @xmath34 carries information on the azimuthal flux , as implied by the relationship between @xmath34 and @xmath30 in equation ( 8) , and the function @xmath35 carries information about the poloidal flux as expressed by equation ( 9 ) .",

    ", we set this @xmath43 to zero , which is equivalent to setting the flux function @xmath29 to zero along the polar axes .",
    "suppose we are given the field @xmath4 in the unbounded space @xmath24 denoted as @xmath5 .",
    "this field has a flux anchored to the inner boundary @xmath10 so that the classical helicity of woltjer is not gauge invariant and we must use instead the relative helicity of berger & field ( 1984 ) .",
    "this is given by the formula derived in berger ( 1985 ) : @xmath44 which involves extending the domain @xmath5 to the spherical region @xmath45 denoted as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a potential field with vector potential @xmath48 .",
    "this potential field continues into the given field @xmath4 across the boundary with continuity of @xmath12 .",
    "the important point here is that @xmath49 is independent of the gauge and is a physical quantity describing the topological complexity of the field @xmath4 in @xmath24 .",
    "we calculate @xmath49 as follows .",
    "the solenoidal condition requires @xmath50 for the continuity of the normal field across @xmath10 .",
    "equivalently , in terms of the vector potential , we require @xmath51 for the continuity of the tangential components of the vector potential ( berger & field 1984 ) .",
    "equation ( 12 ) requires that both @xmath29 and @xmath52 are continuous across @xmath10 .",

    "this numerical evidence indicates that force - free fields can only self - confine its magnetic pressure by its tension force provided its azimuthal flux is less than a bound determined by its poloidal flux fixed by the boundary condition .",

    "this implies that we are getting close to finding a stringent bound on the total magnetic helicity by inequality ( 49 ) , a more stringent inequality than inequality ( 35 ) is .    as pointed out by the referee , an interesting feature from figure 4",
    "is that our y values do not vanish to zero when both the total magnetic helicity and azimuthal flux vanish . inserting equations ( 46)-(48 ) into equation ( 50 )",

    "@xmath140 is a multiplication of @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",

    "this is the trivial potential field and is not an interesting field for our consideration of helicity upper bound . owing to its mathematical form in equation ( 55 ) , @xmath144 approaches 1 as @xmath133",
    "this is indicated by the plot in the bottom panel of figure 5 , where @xmath144 values are plotted against @xmath148 and are approaching to 1 as @xmath148 increases .",
    "so , on the limit of @xmath100 or , equivalently , @xmath133 , @xmath149 and hence we have @xmath150    now we see that in the limit of @xmath100 , the bound on @xmath49 reduces to a problem of finding an upper bound on @xmath102 .",
    "the force - free solutions of flyer et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggest that such an upper bound exists ( see also figure 2 in this paper ) . our tighter inequality ( 59 )",
    "has thus provided a more stringent bound on @xmath49 that had eluded from the lose inequality ( 35 ) .",
    "figure 6 shows the variations of @xmath151 against @xmath66 for @xmath152 and @xmath153 families .",
    "these plots show that the relationship @xmath154 we derived for @xmath100 is also valid for @xmath120 families .",
    "so this relationship may be a general relationship that is valid for all @xmath65 values .",
    "if this is true , it tells us that the upper bound on the total magnetic helicity is a less stringent upper bound than that on the total azimuthal flux .",
    "in this paper we proposed a hydromagnetic conjecture that there is an upper bound on the total magnetic helicity that a force - free field in an unbounded domain can contain .",
    "observations have shown that accumulations of helicity with a preferred sign takes places in the two solar hemispheres .",
    "if our conjecture is valid , the relentless accumulation of magnetic helicity in the corona will lead to a cme - type eruption as a natural and unavoidable product of coronal evolution .",
    "this conjecture deserves further investigation to find a mathematical rigorous proof , or disproof . for the present , evidence for and implications of this conjecture",
    "can be found in the several families of power - law axisymmetric force - free fields governed by equation ( 20 ) .",
    "we derived two rigorous inequalities ( s1 and s2 in table 1 ) by applying the cauchy - schwartz and holder inequalities , respectively .",
    "the former ( s1 in table 1 or equation ( 35 ) in the text ) puts an absolute upper bound on the magnitude of total magnetic helicity for each fixed index @xmath65 .",
    "this inequality is simple and rigorous but it is not tight for our purpose , with the bounds increasing monotonically with @xmath65 .",
    "the second inequality ( s2 in table 1 ) relates total magnetic helicity , azimuthal flux and magnetic energy together in an interesting way , which presents a more stringent bound than s1 does .",
    "inequality s2 is further reduced to the simple form of inequality s3 in table 1 when @xmath65 goes to infinity .",
    "we have not proved that the simple form of inequality s3 is valid for all @xmath65 although the numerical data of figure 6 suggest it is .",
    "the validation of inequality s3 for large @xmath65 is sufficient for our purpose , which is to remove our main concern arising from inequality s1 of whether the total helicity is still bounded when @xmath65 becomes very large .",
    "inequality s3 together with the numerical results from flyer et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggest that such an upper bound on the total magnetic helicity exists even when @xmath65 increases without bound .",
    "an important result of our study is the simple formula ( s0 in table 1 ) for the relative helicity of an axisymmetric field .",
    "this formula is useful to future studies of axisymmetric fields applicable , independent of whether the field is force - free or in force balance .",
    "it has a simple physical interpretation : the total relative magnetic helicity in axisymmetric fields is just a simple convolution of the local wrapping of the azimuthal flux element @xmath63 with the poloidal flux @xmath29 .",
    "we note that in hu et al .",
    "( 1997 ) the right hand side of equation s0 has been defined to be a form of helicity and the authors have showed that this form of helicity is conserved under the ideal hydromagnetic induction equation .",
    "their derivation was carried out completely independent of the concept of relative helicity introduced by berger & field ( 1984 ) .",
    "however , our derivation of equation s0 here , from a direct application of the concept of the berger relative helicity , shows that the helicity defined by hu et al .",
    "( 1997 ) is actually the same physical quantity as the berger relative helicity for an axisymmetric field .",
    "what is the relationship between magnetic helicity accumulation and free magnetic energy storage ? which one plays a more fundamental role in producing cmes ?",
    "it seems clear that the greater the total helicity the greater the magnetic energy would be , as suggested by the inequality ( 2 ) .",
    "although this inequality is rigorous only for a finite domain , a similar conclusion is expected generally in the unbounded domain that higher twist implies greater magnetic energy .",
    "the fact that the magnetic energy of a force - free field in the unbounded domain has an upper bound suggests that our conjecture on a similar kind of bound on the total helicity is probably physically sensible .",
    "it is interesting to observe from our figure 2 that the maximum storages of magnetic helicity and magnetic energy do not occur at the same values of @xmath66 .",
    "we suggest that magnetic helicity as a conserved quantity is for sure to be accumulated in the corona whereas the corona may release its free energy by magnetic reconnection without leading to a cme expulsion .",
    "so for fields with large energy storage but moderate helicity storage , the field may release energy when a suitable trigger acts on it .",
    "but when magnetic helicity has accumulated to cross over the upper bound , we proposed , a cme expulsion becomes unavoidable .    in this sense , exceeding",
    "the allowable level of helicity in a force - free field is only a sufficient condition for an eruption .",
    "it is an extreme condition where a field has accumulated enough helicity that an eruption becomes unavoidable .",
    "a cme expulsion may still occur even before this helicity limit is reached , as long as the separate necessary condition , that of having enough magnetic energy for an eruption , is met .",
    "for example , mass - loading is an efficient way to store enough free magnetic energy to drive cmes , without having to cross the threshold on excessive magnetic helicity accumulation . in zhang & low ( 2004 ) an equilibrium state",
    "is given where prominences are supported by the magnetic fields in the so - called normal configuration .",
    "these solutions show that significant magnetic energy can be stored with only a relatively small amount of total azimuthal magnetic flux and magnetic helicity .",
    "an interesting question for future investigation is then whether a coronal field may accumulate helicity to the point of exceeding the applicable upper bound without first having enough free magnetic energy to erupt into a cme .",
