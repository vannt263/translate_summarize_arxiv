    "reynolds@xcite sought , from the navier - stokes equation , `` the dependence of the character of motion on a relation between the dimensional properties and the external circumstances of motion . ''",
    "assuming that the motion depends on a single velocity scale @xmath5  and length scale @xmath6 , reynolds found that the accelerations are of two distinct types and thereby deduced that the relevant solution of the navier - stokes equation `` would show the birth of eddies to depend on some definite value of @xmath7,''@xcite where @xmath8 is the mass density of the fluid and @xmath9  is the coefficient of viscosity .",

    "the latter parameterization does not technically lead to a reynolds number , but it will be shown that the two parameterizations become equivalent at large reynolds numbers .",

    ":  if two turbulent flows have the same geometry and the same reynolds number , then their statistics , when appropriately scaled , should be equal .",
    "a statistic of the small scales of turbulence is an average of quantities that contain only products of differences , such as two - point velocity difference or derivatives of velocity .",
    "universality of the small scales of turbulence is the hypothesis that statistics of the small scales , when appropriately scaled , should become equal as reynolds number increases @xcite@xcite ; that is , the flow geometry becomes negligible in the limit that the reynolds number is infinite .",
