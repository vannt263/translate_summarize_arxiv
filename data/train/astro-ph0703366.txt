    "is based on two _ ad hoc _ assumptions which can not be deduced from first principles :    1 .   a random phase ( or corrsin type ) approximation was applied ( see eq .",
    "( [ s3eq2 ] ) ) .",
    "2 .   a gaussian distribution of field lines was assumed ( see eq .",
    "( [ s4eq2 ] ) ) .",
    "( [ s51eq9 ] ) therefore provides an accurate result , suggesting a superdiffusive behavior of flrw in real systems , provided that the latter two assumptions hold .",
    "however , one might draw the conclusion that the non - diffusivity deduced in this article is a consequence of ( two ) inaccurate approximations .",
    "we shall attempt to remove this ambiguity in the discussion that follows .    in another article ( @xcite )",
    "we show that already for pure slab fluctuations where flrw can be described without any assumptions or approximations , a superdiffusive result can be obtained be replacing the standard spectrum of eq .",
    "( [ slabwave ] ) by a decreasing spectrum in the energy range . according to these results ,",
    "superdiffusion indeed arises as the _ normal _",
    ", by default behavior of flrw .",
    "classical ( markovian ) diffusion can only be obtained in very special limits ( wave spectrum exactly constant in the energy range and pure slab geometry ) .",
    "the slab correlation function decays rapidly with increasing distance ( see eq .",
    "( [ slabcorrelation ] ) ) . for decreasing wave spectra in the energy range and for non - slab models ,",
    "however , we find a much weaker ( non - exponential ) decrease of the magnetic correlation functions .",
    "this weaker descrease of magnetic correlation functions provides a physical explanation of the nondiffusivity discovered in the current article .",
    "a useful application but also a test of the superdiffusive result is cosmic ray scattering perpendicular to the mean magnetic field . in @xcite",
    "the superdiffusive result obtained here is combined with a compound transport model based on the assumption that the guiding centers of the charged cosmic rays follow the magnetic field lines . in this article a quite good agreement between test particle simulations and the combination of compound transport and superdiffusion of flrw was found .",
    "this agreement can also be seen as a proof of the validity of the two assumption ( corrsin s hypothesis , gaussian statistics ) used in this article to deduce the superdiffusive result .    furthermore , it is argued in @xcite that for a diffusive behaviour of field line wandering one always obtains a strong subdiffusive behaviour of cosmic ray perpendicular scattering which can not be true .",
    "thus , the superdiffusive result deduced in the current article is not only a result obtained under certain assumptions .",
    "it seems that the real field lines indeed behave superdiffusively and that this superdiffusivity is essential for understanding charged particle propation .    from a purely fundamental point of view , the statistical - mechanical description of flrw in magnetized plasmas bears certain generic physical characteristics which are encountered in various physical contexts .",
    "our analytical findings are qualitatively reminiscent of earlier results by isichenko on advection - diffusion problems @xcite . physically speaking",
    ", diffusive behavior of turbulence implies a fast decay of lagrangian correlations , sufficiently fast for the limit @xmath54 to converge . in fluid ( non - plasma ) environments , long scale random velocity fluctuations ( depending on boundary conditions )",
    "may dominate the motion of a fluid element and may thus cause the limit to diverge . on the other hand ,",
    "turbulent magnetized plasma systems are characterized by a plethora of nonlinear mechanisms , intertwined with the complex fl topology , which may add up in such a way that anomalous ( non - classical ) diffusion become the rule in plasmas .",
    "persisting correlations among successive fl displacements are thus built - up , resulting in the superdiffusive behavior exposed in our work .",
    "this seems to suggest a general tendency of turbulent magnetized systems , so that previous diffusive flrw considerations ( obtained under various assumptions ) should rather be treated with some caution .",
    "it may be added that a superdiffusive result for flrw was also obtained in various previous works , where distinct methodologies were employed . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the fl separation across the field was studied by adopting an ad hoc form for the magnetic correlation tensor ; its behavior was found to be very sensitive to the exact form of the power spectrum , while a parabolic ( ballistic ) regime was shown to rule for steep spectra . in ref .",
    "@xcite , geometric ( non - statistical ) arguments were employed to study flrw in galactic cosmic rays . a superdiffusive behavior was also found , independently from the turbulence spectrum ( though mainly shallow spectra were considered therein ) .",
    "similar findings were reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the context of thermal conduction in galactic clusters . a chaotic magnetic fl behavior ( explicitly assumed to obey a lyapunov behavior over a wide range of length scales ) , i.e. assuming an exponential fl divergence , was there shown to enhance perpendicular thermal conduction significantly , essentially increasing thermal conductivity in the transverse direction ( previously thought to be much weaker than the parallel one ) by a factor ( up to ) 5 , as compared to the spitzer value @xcite . still in the galactic thermal conduction context , refs .",
    "@xcite have adopted a double diffusion concept , where particle diffusion along the field was related to flrw in space , in order to study thermal conduction and electron diffusion along the magnetic field ; a combined phenomenological , fokker - planck and numerical approach , fl displacement was shown to increase fast over length scales which are a multiple of the characteristic turbulence scale .",
