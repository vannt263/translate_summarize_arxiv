    "galaxies form when gas cools radiatively inside a dark matter ( dm ) halo .",
    "the haloes in turn form from the non - linear collapse of initially small density perturbations that were imprinted by quantum fluctuations before inflation .",
    "when the virial temperature of the halo is high enough the gas can cool radiatively ( @xcite ) and may become self - gravitating .",
    "some fraction of the cooling gas can form stars , which then affect the baryon distribution and star formation rate through feedback ; for example from supernova ( sn ) explosions ( e.g. @xcite ) .    simulating the growth of dark matter haloes from",
    "initially small cosmological density perturbations has become routine to the extent that even the complex non - linear stage can be predicted with relative confidence ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , following the behaviour of the baryons until stars form is much more demanding for two main reasons .",
    "firstly , the physical processes that lead to star formation are still relatively poorly understood , even in the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "stars are thought to form in molecular clouds in a complex interstellar medium ( ism ) in which magnetic fields ( @xcite ) , cosmic rays , turbulence ( @xcite ) , relativistic jets ( @xcite ) , molecules , dust , and radiative transfer may all play some role .",
    "secondly , the physical scales on which star formation takes place is vastly different from those of cosmological interest .",
    "therefore , simulations on a sufficiently large scale to sample cosmological structures can not presently also resolve physics on the scales relevant for star formation .",
    "for these two reasons simulations invariably include sub - grid physics that model the complexity of star formation in the interstellar medium using simple rules .    in the first generation of hydrodynamic models for galaxy formation ( @xcite ) , the gaseous component of galaxies is modelled as a single fluid . because the spatial and mass resolution in these simulations is insufficient to resolve star formation they rely upon a simple star formation prescription . in its simplest form",
    "this consists of devising criteria by which simulated gas can be flagged as eligible to form stars and then converting the gas to stars by hand ( see e.g. @xcite for a comparison of such criteria ) .",
    "feedback from core collapse ( type ii ) sne , modelled as an extra source of thermal or kinetic energy , was found to have little effect in the early models .",
    "this is because the gas in the surroundings of star formation sites is at high density and so is very efficient at just radiating away the added energy . as a consequence , too much gas cooled in dense knots , producing galaxies much more concentrated than those observed ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ism in observed galaxies is much more complex than the single phase medium present in these early simulations .",
    "although observed galaxies may have comparable mean gas density to the simulated ones , the real ism consists of very dense cold clouds with small volume filling factor , embedded in a much more tenuous low - density , hot medium with a warm  phase at the interface .",
    "sn explosions in the tenuous medium have a much greater impact on the galaxy because this medium cools much less efficiently than gas at the mean density . throughout this work",
    "we will use the label cold   to describe the molecular clouds in the ism ; and the labels warm   and hot   to describe the properties of the ambient gas phase at temperatures of approximately @xmath0k and @xmath1k respectively .    in response to these problems with the simplest star formation and feedback criteria",
    "several authors have introduced multiphasemodels for star formation in which the ism is treated as a number of distinct phases .",
    "these schemes take various forms including modification of the simulation algorithm ( @xcite ) , treating the multiphase medium implicitly by formulating differential equations that model the interactions between the phases ( @xcite ) , explicitly decoupling supernova heated gas from its surroundings ( @xcite ) , or by decoupling the cold molecular phase from the hot phase by one of a variety of methods , including sticky particles  ( @xcite ) or removing coldparticles from the sph calculation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the decoupling of the hot and cold ism phases allows thermal heating from sn feedback to become more efficient ( due to the much lower density of the hot phase ) and also allows one to follow the properties of the cold molecular phase of the ism .",
    "this paper describes an attempt to mimic the multiphase medium in a star forming galaxy .",
    "since stars are known to form in molecular clouds our method focuses on simple rules for cloud formation .",
    "the star formation recipe then simply converts the most massive of these clouds , giant molecular clouds   ( gmcs ) , into stars with an imposed efficiency taken from mw observations .",
    "once a gmc forms stars stellar feedback destroys the cloud . we do not attempt to model the clouds themselves using hydrodynamics , because our current galaxy formation simulations lack by some margin the dynamic range to resolve the jeans mass ( @xmath2 ) in the cold , dense gas that makes up the clouds .",
    "we can demonstrate this lack of resolution by considering theoretical models of the ism ( e.g. @xcite ) , who calculated the thermal equilibrium gas properties of a diffuse ism .",
    "@xcite found that a stable two phase medium was produced , with a transition from hot material at densities @xmath3 to cold , molecular material at densities @xmath4 .",
    "the jeans mass of the warm ( @xmath5 ) phase is approximately @xmath6 , whereas the jeans mass of the cold molecular gas ( @xmath7 ) is @xmath8 .",
    "typical cosmological galaxy simulations currently have mass resolutions no better than @xmath9 ( @xcite ) , many orders of magnitude away from being able to resolve the relevant scales for accurate tracking of the cold molecular phase .",
    "note that these simulations do however resolve @xmath10 in the warm phase . given this limitation ,",
    "we are forced to instead introduce another particle type in our simulations , called a sticky particle , to represent the clouds .",
    "these move as ballistic particles through the ambient medium , yet when they encounter another sticky particle interact inelastically based on a set of collision rules that mimic the coagulation of clouds .",
    "sticky particles have been used before for similar reasons by e.g. @xcite and @xcite , and seem to have been introduced originally by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we show below that our imposed collision rules produce cloud statistics that are similar to those determined in nearby galaxies , for which they can be measured .",
    "we begin by giving a brief overview of the current theory of the ism and the formation of clouds , on which our recipes are based ( section [ sec : obssf ] ) .",
    "we then introduce the physics we model with the sticky particle prescription ( section [ sec : model ] ) , and constrain all of the free parameters in the model ( section [ sec : parameter - est ] ) .",
    "we then present results from simple isolated galaxy simulations ( section [ sec : results ] ) and investigate the effects of changing the physics in the sticky particle model ( section [ sec : away ] ) .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] contains conclusions and details of future work .",
    "the ism is a complicated system and the nomenclature used to describe it is correspondingly complex .",
    "for this reason appendix [ app : list - of - symbols ] contains a list of symbols and their associated meanings .",
    "readers not interested in numerical details can read the summary of the model in section [ sec : model ] and then directly proceed to the analysis of the properties of the simulated galaxies presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "according to the models of @xcite ( hereafter mo77 ; see also @xcite ) the ism of the mw consists of at least three separate and distinct gas phases : a hot tenuous medium at a temperature of @xmath11 ; cold , dense molecular clouds at a temperature of @xmath12 and a warm medium that exists at the boundaries between clouds and the hot medium with @xmath13 . in the mw ,",
    "the hot medium has a filling factor of 7080% and the cold clouds account for a few percent of the volume ( mo77 ) .",
    "different techniques are used to observe these different phases , with radio observations probing roto - vibrational transitions of molecules ( mainly co ) , the 21-cm line probing atomic hydrogen , and uv- and x - ray observations probing the hot phase , see e.g. @xcite for an overview and further references .",
    "the fact that different techniques are used to observe the different gas phases might exaggerate the degree to which these phases are really distinct .",
    "observations of star formation in the mw show that most stars form in groups , either as gravitationally bound clusters or unbound associations , in the most massive of the molecular clouds ( giant molecular clouds , hereafter gmcs ) , with masses @xmath14 , and sizes of order 30 - 50pc , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite for recent reviews .",
    "the relatively small sizes of gmcs currently limit detailed observations of such clouds to nearby galaxies , with recent surveys done in the mw ( @xcite ) , m33 ( @xcite ) and the lmc ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite present detailed observations of gmcs in five local galaxies .",
    "gmcs are excellent tracers of spiral structure to the extent that they are often used to _ define _ the location of arms , in a similar way as , for example , hii regions or massive stars are .",
    "there is a good correlation between the locations of gmcs and filaments of hi , although hi is often observed without accompanying molecular clouds , suggesting that the clouds form from hi .",
    "observations in more distant galaxies are currently limited to measuring the mean surface density of molecular gas with more detailed observations awaiting new instruments such as alma . according to @xcite , the fraction of gas in the molecular phase depends on hubble type , with early - type spirals tending to be predominantly molecular and late - types atomic .",
    "optically barred spirals show a clear enhancement of co emission along the bar .",
    "this suggests that the large - scale structure of the galaxy affects the formation of clouds and hence , presumably , also the star formation rate .",
    "a physical implementation of star formation should therefore aim to track the formation and evolution of molecular clouds .",
    "but how do gmcs form ?",
    "although the early models by @xcite assumed that the different phases of the ism were in pressure equilibrium , modern observations paint a picture of a much more complex and dynamic situation in which the ism is shaped by turbulence , possibly powered by sne and the large - scale dynamics of the galactic disk itself , see e.g. @xcite for a recent review .",
    "a galaxy - wide effect seems to be required to explain the observed hubble - type dependence of cloud properties .    yet",
    "how gmcs form in this complex environment is not well understood ( @xcite ) .",
    "some authors have suggested that gmcs form by the coagulation of preexisting molecular clouds ( @xcite ) while others have argued that gmcs form primarily from atomic gas through instability or large - scale shocks ( @xcite ) . a viable mechanism by which this could occur is the formation of convergent flows induced by a passing spiral arm ( @xcite ) .",
    "of course , both modes of formation may occur : in high density regions , where the vast majority of hydrogen is molecular it seems likely that molecular clouds form from the coagulation of smaller clouds , whereas in the outskirts of galaxies where the gas is predominantly atomic the compression of gas in spiral density shock waves provides a more plausible formation mechanism .",
    "observationally , star formation in disks seems to occur only above a given surface - density threshold ( @xcite ) , with star formation dropping abruptly below the threshold even though the gaseous disk may extend far beyond it .",
    "@xcite describes a model in which this threshold arises naturally due to the thermal instability when gas cools from @xmath0k to the cold phase ( @xmath15k ) , rendering the disk gravitationally unstable on a range of scales .",
    "this suggests that a combination of thermal instability and large - scale dynamics may be responsible for determining when and where gmcs form .",
    "@xcite discusses observational evidence that gmcs are in fact short lived entities that form , make stars and disperse again on their dynamical time scale .",
    "this short time - scale alleviates the need for an internal energy source to sustain the observed internal supersonic turbulence , something that had puzzled astronomers for a long time .",
    "@xcite discuss this assumption in more detail and suggest that gmcs form from agglomeration of the dense phase of the ism , already in molecular form , when compressed in a spiral shock .",
    "they envisage the pre - existing molecular gas to be in dense wisps , in the inter arm regions , formed from atomic gas by shocks , as simulated by @xcite .",
    "recent numerical simulations support the view that when clumpy gas is overrun by a density wave it produces structures that resemble gmcs .",
    "@xcite present high - resolution two - dimensional simulations of the evolution of perturbations in a cooling , self - gravitating disk in differential rotation .",
    "they show that the disk develops stationary turbulence , even without any stellar feedback . @xcite and @xcite performed three dimensional simulations of the passage of clumpy cold gas through a spiral shock .",
    "their simulations produce dense clouds , with large internal velocity dispersion , reminiscent of the supersonic turbulence seen in gmcs .",
    "they note that the velocity dispersion is generated on all scales simultaneously , in contrast to what is usually meant by turbulence where energy cascades from large to small scales .",
    "@xcite review the current state of the art in simulations and models of gmc formation , including references to more recent work . in this picture of clouds , gmcs are temporary structures formed and dissolving in converging flows .",
    "they do not require an internal source of energy , are not in virial or pressure equilibrium and need not even be gravitationally bound .",
    "they point out that the relative contribution of galactic rotation and stellar sources to driving the observed turbulence is not clear .      in the older picture of cloud formation",
    ", gmcs were long - lived , gravitationally bound , virialised objects .",
    "the presence of supersonic turbulence ensures that clouds do not immediately collapse to form stars , as this would predict a star formation rate for the mw which is far higher than observed .",
    "locally unstable clumps collapse to form proto - stars , which built - up their mass to produce the initial mass function ( imf ) through competitive accretion ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , simulations show that the energy contained in supersonic motions is quickly dissipated even in the presence of magnetic fields ( see references in @xcite ) . to sustain",
    "the turbulence therefore requires an energy source , for example from star formation , yet some clouds have turbulence but no current star formation .",
    "the modern picture is one in which clouds are short - lived structures and the turbulence results from the same process that formed the cloud in the first place .",
    "observationally , gmcs turn a small fraction @xmath16 of their mass into stars before they disperse again .",
    "this low star formation efficiency of clouds may be due to the fact that they are short lived .",
    "the short life times of ( star forming ) clouds also follows from the small age spread in star clusters ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and indicates that star formation in a given cloud only lasts for a few million years .",
    "the short life - times of gmcs then also suggests that competitive accretion ( e.g. @xcite ) is less important in shaping the imf ( @xcite ) .",
    "turbulence generates a range of substructures inside a gmc , and @xcite suggest that such turbulent fragmentation  builds a mass spectrum of proto - cores , some of which will collapse under their own gravity to form stars .",
    "the resulting imf is a power - law due to the self - similar nature of the turbulence . only cores dense enough so that self gravity can overcome their magnetic and thermal energy can collapse .",
    "this consideration flattens that imf at low masses , and prevents very low - mass cores from forming stars .",
    "they also argue that the maximum mass is a fraction of the overall cloud mass .    a young stellar population does , of course , dump a lot of energy into its surroundings through stellar winds , ionisation , and sn explosions .",
    "even if these do not drive the observed turbulence , they may contribute to the destruction of the cloud , and prevent further star formation .",
    "most simulations use such feedback from star formation to regulate the star formation rate .",
    "the current theory of star formation in disk galaxies suggests that supersonic turbulence , generated by a combination of galactic rotation and sne , regulates the formation of proto - stellar cores inside more massive molecular clouds .",
    "some fraction of these clouds can form stars , before the cloud itself is destroyed , by a combination of stellar feedback and the turbulence that built the cloud in the first place .",
    "the cooling of the cores to temperatures @xmath17k is dominated by grains and cii fine - structures lines and is opposed by photo - electric heating from small grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , see @xcite .",
    "a numerical implementation of these processes requires high resolution to model the interstellar turbulence and follow the contraction of cores of masses a few @xmath18 at densities above 1 particle per @xmath19 .",
    "such challenging simulations may be feasible in the near future for high - redshift galaxies but are not possible yet for @xmath20 galaxies .",
    "below we describe a model of cloud formation that tries to incorporate some of these processes with some simple rules .",
    "we would like to apply the same rules to cosmological simulations of galaxy formation , which clearly requires a leap of faith .",
    "high - redshift galaxies may not have a well - defined disk , and hence the properties of the supersonic turbulence and the gmcs may well be very different .",
    "in the high - redshift simulations of @xcite , the first molecular cloud is close to hydrostatic equilibrium , with pressure support slowly leaking away as it cools through molecular hydrogen line emission .",
    "this quasi - static evolution , reminiscent of a cooling flow , is very different from the dynamic turbulent fragmentation envisaged in the mw , with corresponding large differences in the predicted imf .",
    "furthermore , if the properties of the gmcs were similar , the behaviour of the cores may still be very different , with the reduced grain and metal cooling at higher @xmath21 , making for a different imf .    despite these difficulties we must start somewhere .",
    "the assumption that the physics of the ism ( and therefore the stellar imf ) is similar at redshift zero and in the high redshift universe is common in the simulation community .",
    "the understanding gained through these necessarily simplified simulations will allow us , over time , to investigate the physics relevant to galaxy formation at higher redshift .",
    "as demonstrated in section [ sec : intro ] , in typical simulations of galaxy formation we can resolve the jeans length of the ambient gas phase and so treat its hydrodynamic properties consistently .",
    "however , we can not yet resolve the properties of the cold molecular phase of the ism .",
    "we therefore follow the evolution of the ambient gas phase using a hydrodynamic simulation code , whereas we treat the cold phase using a statistical model that encapsulates the physics relevant to the formation and evolution of molecular clouds . in this section",
    "we introduce the properties of the sticky particle model and describe the physics we have implemented .    following @xcite we consider the ism to consist of warm and hot ambient materials , and cold molecular clouds .",
    "we additionally treat the properties of sn remnants . throughout this paper the properties of the ambient medium",
    "will be represented with the subscript @xmath22 , the properties of the molecular clouds with the subscript @xmath23 , and the properties of the gas internal to sn remnants , or hot bubbles , with the subscript @xmath24 .",
    "the ambient gas phase is represented using the entropy conserving , parallel tree - sph code gadget2 ( @xcite ) , which is a lagrangian code used to calculate gravitational and hydrodynamic forces on a particle by particle basis .",
    "smoothed - particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) was originally introduced by @xcite and @xcite , see e.g. @xcite for a review .",
    "we will refer to the gas component treated using sph as ambient gas to distinguish it from the cold molecular gas .",
    "ambient gas at temperatures around @xmath25 will be referred to as warm , and gas at temperatures of @xmath26 and higher will be called hot .",
    "we will see that in galaxy formation simulations , this ambient ( i.e. non - molecular ) medium naturally develops three relatively well - defined phases : a warm ( @xmath27k ) component in a galactic disk , a hot ( @xmath28k ) ) tenuous component of shock - heated gas in the halo , and a similarly hot component resulting from gas heated by sn .",
    "the fourth , cold ( @xmath29k ) and molecular cloud phase is represented with sticky particles , which interact gravitationally with all other material in the simulation and are allowed to stick together forming more massive sticky particles .",
    "stars and dark matter are both treated as collisionless particles by gadget2 .",
    "the different phases of the ism may interact with each other as follows : thermally unstable ambient gas may collapse into molecular clouds via thermal instability ( section [ sec : cloud - form ] ) .",
    "molecular clouds can interact with each other to form gmcs ( section [ sec : coagulation ] ) .",
    "gmcs then collapse into stars ( section [ sec : cloud - collapse ] ) .",
    "stars disrupt the cloud they formed from and may , via sn feedback , return energy ( section [ sec : energy - feedback ] ) to the ambient phase .",
    "hot bubbles blown by sne can evaporate cold clouds ( [ sec : conduction ] ) and heat the ambient medium .",
    "fig [ fig : modsumm ] contains a summary of all of the physics implemented in our model .",
    "arrows represent a transfer of mass and/or energy from one phase to another .",
    "the distinction between clouds and gmcs is somewhat arbitrary ; they are separated in the figure to allow an easy pictorial representation of mass transfer within a single phase .",
    "appendix [ app : list - of - symbols ] contains a list of frequently used symbols and their meaning .",
    "each physical process will be treated in turn in the remainder of this section .",
    "we first introduce the physics relevant to each physical process before discussing the numerical implementation .",
    "we will also give our preferred physical values for the various parameters that occur .",
    "how we choose these is discussed in section  [ sec : parameter - est ] .",
    "@xcite show that under appropriate physical conditions , a thermal instability may operate in the ambient gas , which causes a fraction of the gas to condense into much colder molecular clouds .",
    "the sticky particle star formation prescription contains a basic representation of this process , based on a detailed treatment of baryonic radiative cooling .",
    "the radiative processes that we take into account are compton cooling off the microwave background , thermal bremsstrahlung cooling , line cooling and photo - ionization heating from hydrogen , helium and metal species in the presence of an imposed ionising background .",
    "these routines were developed for a different project and will be described elsewhere .",
    "briefly , they use tabulated rates for radiative cooling and photo - ionization heating for many species and ionization states computed assuming ionization equilibrium using cloudy ( version 05.07 of the code last described by @xcite ) with a uv background given by @xcite .",
    "the rates are tabulated element by element and we will assume solar abundance ratios and specify a fixed metallicity of the gas in solar units .",
    "we do , however , note that the behaviour of the system may depend upon precisely which value of the metallicity we choose , and investigate this in section [ sec : away ]    other processes such as cosmic ray heating , and cooling by dust and atomic lines that affect the molecular gas in clouds are not treated explicitly since we do not model the internal properties of the clouds themselves .",
    "we include a simple model to determine the rate at which the ambient gas forms molecular clouds .",
    "when we identify ambient gas that is thermally unstable ( @xcite ) we allow it to collapse into molecular clouds .",
    "the rate at which this process occurs is goverened by the rate at which the gas is losing thermal energy by radiative cooling .      following @xcite we define a density threshold , @xmath30 , to determine when gas becomes thermally unstable .",
    "gas with @xmath31 undergoes ordinary radiative cooling .",
    "gas with density above the threshold becomes thermally unstable and begins to be converted to molecular clouds .",
    "in addition to the density criterion we add a maximum temperature ( @xmath32 ) for gas to be called thermally unstable which has the effect of preventing sn heated gas in dense regions from collapsing straight to the cold phase .",
    "when gas has been identified as thermally unstable it begins to form molecular clouds at a rate controlled by the rate at which the gas can lose thermal energy by radiative cooling @xmath33 where @xmath34 represent an internal energies per unit mass .",
    "the subscripts @xmath22 and @xmath23 refer to the ambient phase ( either warm or hot ) and cold phase respectively .",
    "@xmath35 is the cooling rate of the ambient gas ( ergs @xmath19 s@xmath36 ) .",
    "we assume that the cold clouds remain at a fixed temperature of @xmath37k hence their thermal energy @xmath38 is a constant as well .    in practice ,",
    "each ambient gas particle is identified as either thermally unstable , or non - thermally unstable .",
    "non - thermally unstable gas undergoes radiative cooling ; thermally unstable ambient gas forms molecular clouds at a rate controlled by the radiative cooling rate , as described by eq .",
    "[ eq : coldform ] .    in this way",
    "each ambient gas particle can keep track of what fraction of its mass is in the form of molecular clouds .",
    "gas in the molecular phase is ignored for the purposes of the sph calculation .",
    "when the amount of mass in the molecular phase in a particle reaches the resolution limit of the simulation a separate sticky particle , representing many sub - resolution molecular clouds is created .",
    "this process decouples the molecular clouds from the associated ambient phase . since we can not resolve the individual molecular clouds in each sticky particle we work with the mass function of clouds .",
    "initially we assume that the molecular clouds formed through instability are all in the smallest mass bin , that is that the clouds formed by thermal instability are very small , and will interact to form more massive clouds . in the following section we describe the behaviour and evolution of the sticky particles in the simulation .",
    "molecular clouds are typically many orders of magnitude more dense than the medium they form in ( mo77 ) , and their behaviour is governed by a different set of rules than the ambient medium .",
    "this section describes the physics of the simplified molecular clouds in the sticky particle model and how it is implemented .",
    "we assume that clouds may be treated as approximately spherical objects that obey a power law relation between mass ( @xmath39 ) and radius ( @xmath40 ) @xmath41 here , @xmath42 describes how clouds grow as mass is added to them ( if they remain at constant density then @xmath43 ) , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are a reference mass and radius used to fix the normalisation of this relation . the lower bound on molecular cloud masses is typically calculated to be 100@xmath46 ( @xcite ) due to the efficient destruction of smaller molecular clouds by photoionization .",
    "we introduce an upper limit by converting molecular clouds with large masses into stars ( see section [ sec : cloud - collapse ] for discussion ) . in order to facilitate easy estimates of the relative importance of various effects",
    "we have substituted typical numbers and units into most of the equations in this section .",
    "each sticky particle represents numerous cold clouds .",
    "sticky particles are hydrodynamically decoupled from the ambient sph phase of the gas and interact only gravitationally with the other phases in the simulation . however , when two sticky particles collide they may coagulate to form a more massive sticky particle .",
    "the mass of the smallest molecular clouds is typically orders of magnitude below the mass resolution in a cosmological simulation .",
    "we represent an entire mass spectrum of clouds statistically inside of each sticky particle . our formalism to treat the evolution of the mass function of clouds internal to each of the multiple cloud particles will start from the smoluchowski equation of kinetic aggregation ( @xcite ) , which describes the behaviour of a system consisting of ballistic particles that can interact via mergers .",
    "the coagulation behaviour of this system is driven by a coagulation kernel , @xmath47 , that represents the formation rate of clouds of masses @xmath48 ,    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the relative velocity of the clouds and @xmath51 is the collision cross section .",
    "for a maxwellian distribution of velocities with three - dimensional dispersion @xmath52 we obtain @xmath53 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the product of the approach velocity and the collision cross section is averaged over the distribution of relative velocities .",
    "the cross section is @xmath54 where the first term represents the collision geometric cross section and the second term represents the effect of gravitational focusing ( @xcite ) .",
    "the focused term becomes significant when the approach velocity is not much larger than the internal velocity dispersion of the system . in most cases of interest",
    "the geometric term will dominate so the focused term is neglected . in these calculations",
    "we need to assume that molecular clouds , although transient and turbulent , are stable for long enough for coagulation to take place .",
    "this is reasonable because the cloud velocity dispersion is typically larger than the sound speed of the cold cloud gas ( @xcite ) .    to model the cooling of sub - resolution molecular clouds via gravitational interaction",
    "it has been assumed that when molecular clouds with relative velocities , @xmath50 greater than @xmath55 ( a parameter in our simulations ) collide they do not merge , but rather bounce back with relative velocity a fraction , @xmath56 , of the initial approach velocity .",
    "clouds with relative velocities less than @xmath57 merge .",
    "for simplicity it has been assumed that the velocity distribution of clouds is maxwellian with a velocity dispersion that is a function of cloud mass , @xmath58 .",
    "the upper and lower bounds on the molecular cloud mass function are set such that the smallest mass bin is comparable with the smallest clouds was can observe , and the largest molecular clouds are approximately the same mass as the largest clouds in the mw .",
    "the mass function is discrete .",
    "all clouds are assumed to form at the lowest mass , @xmath59 , and then the mass of each bin is a multiple of this value .",
    "this discrete mass function is neccessary when working with the smoluchowski equation .    in order for us to be able to hold a mass function with a large number of bins internal to every single sticky particle without the requirement to store one number for each mass bin we parameterize the mass function as a third order polynomial , and store only the four coefficients between timesteps .    as these sub - resolution clouds",

    "the same processes ( cooling and merging ) are followed explicitly for the individual particles in our simulations , which can interact in the same two ways as the unresolved sub resolution clouds by merging to form more massive sticky particles , or cooling to decrease their relative velocities .",
    "following the same rules should allow us to remove much of the resolution dependence of the star formation prescription .",
    "as the mass resolution of a simulation is degraded , more massive clouds will be treated with the sub - grid physics ; our implementation should ensure that the large scale results are approximately the same .",
    "this is demonstrated in section [ sec : calib ] .",
    "the vast majority of stars form in giant molecular clouds .",

    "the ism model can also reproduce the observed schmidt law .",
    "we find that in our model the interaction between the coagulation of clouds and their destruction by stars leads to a sfr - density relation that is in good agreement with observation ( fig  ( [ fig : schmidtlaw ] ) ) if @xmath189 is set to 7km / s .",
    "this represents a reasonable value for the molecular cloud velocity dispersion , as considering theoretical models for the origin of random motion on molecular clouds , we would expect typical velocity dispersions in the range 5 - 7km / s ( @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of changing the mass resolution of the simulation over two orders of magnitude is demonstrated in fig  ( [ fig : resolution ] ) .",
    "sub - resolution clouds that are simulated only by integrating the coagulation equations are designed to behave in exactly the same way as the resolved cloud particles in the simulation , and so we expect the simulations not to depend strongly on particle number .",
    "this is borne out by the good agreement between simulations carried out with only one resolved particle ( fig  ( [ fig : resolution ] ) , line with mass resolution of @xmath201 ) where all of the physics is followed by integrating the sub - grid equations in a single particle and simulations with a hundred particles that are followed explicitly .",
    "as stated in previous sections , the behaviour of a one zone model is virtually independent of its initial temperature and the fraction of the gas that starts off in the cold phase .",
    "this behaviour is demonstrated in fig  ( [ fig : ozics ] ) .",
    "a one zone volume with total initial density of @xmath185@xmath19 was evolved with a variety of different initial values for the initial temperature and initial fraction of the mass in the hot phase .",
    "we observe that regardless of the initial choices for these two quantities the system quickly settles down to its equilibrium state .",
    "this process occurs through the opposing actions of thermal conduction and supernova feedback .",
    "fig  ( [ fig : phases1 ] ) and fig  ( [ fig : phases16 ] ) show the behaviour of the large scale properties of two different one zone volumes as a function of time .",
    "the only difference in the initial conditions of the two one zone volumes is their initial density fig  ( [ fig : phases1 ] ) shows the evolution of a one zone volume with a total density of 2 atoms/@xmath106 ; fig  ( [ fig : phases16 ] ) shows exactly the same plots for a density of 16 atoms/@xmath106 .",
    "the initial temperature of the hot phase in both simulations is @xmath1k . in both cases",
    "the star formation rate follows the same general shape .",
    "there is a small period of time at the beginning of the simulation where small clouds are coagulating and there is no star formation . when gmcs are formed there is a large burst of star formation that is quickly quenched by feedback sn and thermal conduction in sn bubbles .",
    "the temperature of the diffuse phase is regulated by a combination of supernova feedback ( acting to increase the temperature ) and radiative cooling . due to the fact that we do not allow mass to leave the one zone volume and",
    "also assume instantaneous recycling , the temperature profile very closely matches that of the star formation rate .",
    "it is noted that in the one zone simulation with the largest density , the temperature of the ambient phase is held at a higher temperature by the action of supernovae . the fraction of the gas in the molecular phase is lower in the high density simulation due to the increased amount of evaporation by thermal conduction in the high temperature ambient phase . in the following sections the star formation and feedback prescriptions",
    "are tested in a more realistic situation .",
    "as a more physically interesting test of the star formation model we have conducted simulations of various isolated model galaxies . in this section we introduce the details of the two different types of simulation performed and present the properties of the stellar disk and associated ism in each case .",
    "one of the fundamental properties that a star formation prescription must be able to reproduce is that in mw like conditions , the resulting behaviour should be similar to that in the mw . in this section",
    "we discuss the properties of galaxy simulations set up to approximate the conditions in the mw s quiescent disk .",
    "we set up a simplified model of a mw type galaxy using initial conditions from galactics ( @xcite ) .",
    "galactics generates near equilibrium distributions of collisionless particles consisting of a disk , bulge and halo .",
    "these models consist of a spherical bulge component ; an approximately exponential disk , which is rotationally supported in the x - y plane and supported by random motion in the z direction ; and an approximately spherical halo .",
    "we add baryonic material to this distribution by converting the disk and bulge in their entirety into sph particles at a temperature of @xmath25 .",
    "1% of the material in the halo is converted to baryons with a temperature of @xmath26 .",
    "the addition of baryonic material puts the system well out of equilibrium so each simulation is run adiabatically for 50myr to allow the galaxy to relax closer to its equilibrium state before the additional physics is allowed to operate .",
    "the total mass in the disk , bulge and halo are @xmath202 , @xmath203 and @xmath204 respectively .",
    "the mass resolution of particles in each of three realisations of this galaxy are summarised in table [ tab : simulationres ] .",
    "these masses were chosen such that the gaseous particles in each of the three components have approximately the same mass and the dark matter halo particles have masses as close as possible to the gas particle mass . the gravitational softenings for the disk particles ( that is : gas , sticky and star )",
    "is set to 0.1kpc , 0.05kpc and 0.02kpc in simulations gal_lores , gal_base and gal_hires respectively .",
    "the dark matter particles have softening lengths ten times larger than the disk particles .",
    ".initial particle masses in three different realisations of the model galactics galaxy that are used throughout this paper .",
    "the disk and bulge consist entirely of baryons , the halo additionally contains dark matter .",
    "all masses are in units of @xmath18 .",
    "baryons are added to the dark matter halo by converting a random 1% of the halo dm particles into gas .",

    "it is clear that star formation is occurring primarily in the spiral arms of the galaxy .",
    ", width=313 ]                        in this section we will discuss simulations run with the base set of physical parameters ( section [ sec : calib ] ) .",
    "most simulations were run at the base mass resolution as defined in table [ tab : simulationres ] .",
    "the large scale behaviour of the model galaxy is as follows : immediately after switching on the additional star formation physics the dense , thermally unstable gas in the disk and bulge collapses into cold clouds , which quickly cause a large burst of star formation .",
    "after approximately 500myr the galaxy settles down into a quiescent state with a star formation rate of approximately 1@xmath205 .",
    "the star formation rate gradually decreases as the cold gas in the galaxy is consumed by stars .",
    "it is known that in the mw , most areas of active star formation are concentrated in the galactic spiral arms ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "fig  ( [ fig : mapcloud ] ) shows that our simulations reproduce this behaviour . in the sticky particle model",
    "this behaviour occurs naturally as the converging gas flows in galactic spiral arms lead to an increased merger rate and , therefore , to the presence of more star forming clouds .",
    "face and edge on temperature and density plots of the standard resolution galaxy are shown in fig  ( [ fig : mapedge ] ) .",
    "the gas heated by snii is preferentially situated perpendicular to the plane of the disk , suggesting that the feedback scheme is preferentially heating the low density gas and setting up strong outflows .",
    "fig  ( [ fig : winds ] ) shows the behaviour of the supernova heated gas in a thin slice through the centre of the disk . initially there is a strong burst of star formation ( lower panel of fig  ( [ fig : winds ] ) ) , followed shortly by a burst of supernova explosions that heat the gas around the galactic disk as hot at @xmath206k .",
    "most of this gas is driven straight out of the halo in a direction perpendicular to the galactic disk .",
    "later on , as the supernova rate dies down , gas is heated more gently and is ejected from the galactic disk in the form of a fountain reminiscent of the galactic fountains present in the mw .",
    "this behaviour is demonstrated in figure [ fig : fountain ] , which shows for a random subset of particles from the gas disk the number of times they have been heated as a function of time with their height above the galactic disk .",
    "it is clear that upon being strongly heated , some particles are ejected from the galactic disk and fall back down a few hundred myr later .",
    "others remain in dense regions and cool immediately .",
    "some escape the disk completely in the form of a galactic wind .",
    "this behaviour was also observed in the multiphase star formation models of @xcite , suggesting that it is a more general feature of multiphase models .",
    "additionally our simulated galaxies are in good agreement with the observed schmidt law , eq  ( [ fig : galacticsschmidt ] ) .",
    "this behaviour arises due to the self - regulation of the simulated ism . at higher densities",
    "more molecular clouds are formed and so star formation rates are higher .",
    "runaway star formation is prevented by various forms of stellar feedback , which prevent too many clouds from forming .",
    "the slope of the schmidt law in the simulated galaxies may be changed by altering the value of @xmath57 .",
    "higher values of @xmath57 lead to clouds coagulating more rapidly , and so low density regions of the galactic disk undergo more star formation .",
    "the effect is less severe in the higher density regions of the galaxy as strong feedback from large bursts of star formation can effectively regulate the amount of star formation .",
    "conversely a lower value of @xmath57leads to a steeper schmidt law with a lower overall star formation rate .",
    "this behaviour is demonstrated in fig  ( [ fig : vm ] ) for the one zone model .",
    "the value of @xmath55 used to reproduce the schmidt law slope and normalisation in the one zone model also works in the simulated galaxy and the observed galaxy follows the observed schmidt law very closely throughout its whole lifetime ( figure  ( [ fig : galacticsschmidt ] ) ) .",
    "the resolution independence of the star formation prescription is once again demonstrated by fig  ( [ fig : galresolution ] ) .",
    "the star formation rate between the highest and lowest mass resolution simulations is in remarkably good agreement .",
    "the general form followed by all simulations is that there is a strong burst of star formation at the initial time , this is rapidly quenched by supernova feedback , and a self - regulating ism is set up .",
    "the star formation rate slowly increases as the gas in the galactic disk is either used up or ejected in the form of winds .",
    "recent observations of the gas content of the mw have allowed the construction of maps of its gas surface density ( @xcite ) . in order to compare the properties of our model to observations ,",
    "another galactics model was generated with properties as close as possible to those of the mw .",
    "the total mass of the galactic disk was set to @xmath207 , and the scale radius of the exponential disk to @xmath208 .",
    "this simulation was evolved for 1gyr .",
    "the resulting gas distribution is shown in fig  ( [ fig : gasmap ] ) .",
    "our simulations are in good agreement with the observations of @xcite .",
    "these properties suggest that the star formation and feedback prescriptions behave well in a quiescent disk , a more robust test of how they perform in a more general situation is given by the rotating collapse simulations .",
    "the second simulation we investigate is the collapse of a rotating spherical halo ( @xcite ) with an initial @xmath209 density profile consisting of 90% collisionless dark matter and 10% baryonic material .",
    "the mass of the rotating sphere is @xmath210 and its initial radius is 100kpc .",
    "velocities are chosen such that the sphere is initially rotating as a solid body with a spin parameter of 0.1 .",

    "the density profiles are averaged around the disk ; each radial bin represents a ring centered on the centre of mass of the disk .",

    "the rotating collapse simulations are especially interesting because they start far from equilibrium and so features that arise in the final particle distribution are purely an effect of the physics in the simulation and not just set up by hand in the initial conditions .",

    "all the gas in the halo is cold .",

    "we use all matter within a vertical distance of 1kpc from the centre of mass of the disk and bin radially .",
    "the model of the ism clearly reproduces the observed behaviour .",
    "the determination of some of the physical parameters used in our model is somewhat uncertain . in this section",
    "we investigate the effect of varying some of the physics included in the models .",
    "large uncertainties are present in the determination of some of the parameters including @xmath179 , the thermal conduction efficiency , and the physics we include in our treatment of sn explosions .",
    "in addition our simulations do not contain a detailed treatment of metals .",
    "we demonstrate the effects of changing each of these parameters on the large scale properties of simulated quiescent disks .",
    "the value of @xmath179 may differ greatly from unity , for example due to radiative cooling of the sn remnant .",
    "we investigate the effect of moving @xmath179 away from unity and also look at changing the physics included in our analytic model for blast wave evolution , firstly by extending the simple sedov solution with the fitting formula due to @xcite and secondly by investigating the effects of preventing radiative cooling in supernova remnants .",
    "altering the value of @xmath179 has , as expected , two main effects .",
    "firstly an increased supernova efficiency can eject gas from the galactic disk more efficiently and quenches star formation very quickly . secondly",
    ", the gas disk in simulations with higher supernova efficiency is found to be less centrally concentrated ; the reverse is also true in simulations with a low supernova efficiency .",
    "this is a result of supernova feedback ejecting gas from the galactic disk more efficiently in the runs with a high value of @xmath179 .",
    "we find that the fiducial value of @xmath223 provides a good match with the observed properties of disk galaxies .",
    "more accurate modelling of the evolution of supernova blast waves ( by using the @xcite fit to the blast wave evolution ) does not significantly change the properties of the galaxy . assuming that a typical supernova remnant expands for approximately @xmath1140.3 myr before being dispersed , that the mean ambient temperature of the ism is @xmath1 k and the mean density is @xmath224 atoms per @xmath106",
    "then the difference in the blast wave radius between the pure sedov solution ( [ eq : sedov ] ) and the modified fitting formula due to @xcite ( eq  ( [ eq : tang ] ) ) is never more than 20% .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig [ fig : sedov ] , which shows a pure sedov blast wave compared with the simulated result from an sph simulation of a blast wave in a hot ( @xmath172 ) medium .",
    "the net result of having larger blast waves is that the porosity of the ism increases at a greater rate and the delay between a supernova explosion occurring and its thermal energy being injected into the ambient medium is decreased .",
    "finally we can switch off the radiative cooling in supernova remnants .",
    "the effects here are much more dramatic . in the dense galactic disk a supernova remnant",
    "can typically radiate away over 90% of its thermal energy before being disrupted .",
    "switching off radiative cooling in supernova remnants , therefore , has a very severe effect in our galaxy simulations , and leads to the almost immediate suppression of star formation and much of the material in the galactic disk is ejected from the galaxy .",
    "this demonstrates that radiative losses from supernova remnants are of crucial importance in our models .",
    "our simulation code does not contain a detailed description of mass feedback from supernovae .",
    "therefore we need to verify that the expected evolution in metallicity over the timescale of the simulation will not substantially affect the properties of the galactic disk .",
    "following @xcite we use a simple analytic model to estimate the change in metallicity over the timescale of a typical simulation then run simulations with metallicites bracketing this range . by assuming that stars form at a constant rate of @xmath225 , that there is one type 2 supernova event per 125@xmath46 of stars formed , and using metal yields due to @xcite we estimate that over the 1gyr timespan of one of the quiescent disk simulations the average metallicity of the galaxy should not change by more than @xmath226 .",
    "the base simulations have a metallicity of @xmath227 , two additional simulations were run with metallicities of @xmath228 and @xmath229 , far outside the metallicity evolution range expected in our quiescent disks .",
    "the total amount of stars after 1gyr in the high metallicity run is 5% higher than in the base run .",
    "the low metallicity run contains approximately 5% less stars than the base run .",
    "this trend arises because the radiative cooling rate of the ambient phase is related to the ambient gas metallicity .",
    "all the properties of the three simulated disks agree to within 10% with the properties of the base simulations .",
    "the reason for the surprisingly small dependence of the galaxy properties on the metallicity of the gas is that in the quiescent disk the gas is maintained at a temperature of @xmath230k . at this temperature",
    "the radiative cooling function does not change very much with metallicity .",
    "we do , however , note that a full treatment of the metal enrichment of the gas is necessary in performing fully cosmological simulations since here the metallicity of the gas may significantly affect the way in which it collapses ( e.g. @xcite ) . in these simulations",
    "we have additionally neglected the change in stellar lifetime with metallicity ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "since we are simulating a quiescent disk , it is not expected that changes to the lifetimes of massive stars will have a large effect on the properties of the galactic disk .    however , as noted by @xcite a detailed prescription for the yields from supernovae is necessary if we want to simulate the early evolution of a galaxy .",
    "one of the most poorly constrained parameters is the efficiency of evaporation of molecular clouds through thermal conduction .",
    "magnetic fields and turbulence may affect the amount of thermal conduction by a large amount ( mo77 ) .",
    "we ran quiescent disk simulations with the efficiency of thermal conduction moved by a factor of five in each direction ( gal_base_locon ; gal_base_hicon ) .",
    "more efficient thermal conduction leads to a lower density of molecular clouds in the galactic disk , as well as making the cloud mass function more shallow .",
    "the star formation rates are affected by a similar amount , in the simulations with a high thermal conduction rate the star formation rate is depressed by an order of magnitude . as discussed in section [ sec : rotcoll ] the base value for the thermal conduction efficiency reproduces many of the observed properties of the mw .",
    "motivated by the fact that we can not reasonably resolve the jeans scale for molecular clouds in galaxy simulations we have introduced a new star formation and feedback prescription .",
    "we model the ambient phase of the ism using a hydrodynamic simulation code and the unresolved molecular gas using a sticky particle prescription .",
    "our model leads to a tightly self - regulating multiphase ism .",
    "the multiphase nature of our star formation prescription avoids a lot of the problems of overcooling that were present in the first generation of star formation models . with the exception of the parameter that controls the molecular cloud coagulation timescale , @xmath57 , all the parameters in our model",
    "can be tightly constrained by observation , leaving the cloud coagulation timescale as a free parameter that we can adjust to match the observed properties of galaxies .",
    "where possible our model of the ism has been formulated in such a way that the results of a simulation should be independent of mass resolution .",
    "we demonstrated that the large scale properties of our simulations were unchanged over a two orders of magnitude shift in mass resolution .",
    "we have applied the sticky particle star formation model to three different types of simulation : a simple one zone model , the rotating collapse of a gas and dark matter sphere and a model of a quiescent galactic disk . after using the one zone simulation to set the value of the parameters that can not be determined observationally ,",
    "the sticky particle model can be applied to the other simulations without any parameter changes .",
    "the simulations of a quiescent disk galaxy reproduce the observed schmidt law with a slope of 1.4 due to the opposing effects of cloud coagulation and feedback effects .",
    "the galaxy also developed a natural three component ism .",
    "finally we observe supernova heated gas in the galaxy being ejected from the disk either in the form of a galactic fountain , or , when the star formation rate ( and associated supernova rate ) is sufficient , in the form of strong bipolar outflows .",
    "both of these results arise as a natural consequence of the physics included in our star formation prescription .",
    "simulations of the collapse of a rotating sphere of dark matter and gas reproduced , many of the observed properties of galactic disks , beginning from an initial condition well out of equilibrium . in particular we observe a stellar disk with distinct bulge and disk components , well fitted by the standard exponential and de vacouleurs density profiles",
    ". the fraction of molecular gas in the disk as a function of radius is reproduced , and agrees well with recent observations of nearby galaxies .",
    "the observed relation between the disk midplane pressure and the fraction of molecular clouds is also reproduced .",
    "we also observe star formation rates comparable to those in disk galaxies and note that our model reproduces the formation of stars in the spiral arms of the galaxy .",
    "our preferred values for most of the parameters are discussed in section [ sec : parameter - est ] ; and are usually constrained by observation .",
    "we varied the values of those parameters that are only weakly constrained and foind that our preferred value of @xmath231 find that we obtain reasonable results . including different physical descriptions of the evolution of supernova blast waves",
    "makes only a modest difference to our results .",
    "finally we note that in the quiescent disk simulation our results depend relatively weakly on metallicity ; although this will not be the case in fully cosmological simulations , for which a full treatment of metal enrichment via supernova feedback is necessary .",
    "a natural continuation of this work is to extend our investigations to higher redshift through the use of fully cosmological simulations , and to explore the behaviour of the ism in colliding galaxies .",
