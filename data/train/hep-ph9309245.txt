    "the accelerators planned to be built in the near future will provide an insight into physics at tev energy scale and thus probe a region especially interesting from the point of view of electroweak interactions .",
    "therefore we observe recently an increased interest in various aspects of phenomenology of the electroweak symmetry breaking , in the framework of the standard model and its extensions , which predict one or more doublets of higgs bosons .",
    "as far as the experimental detection of the higgs particles is concerned , detailed knowledge of their decay properties is of special interest . in the present paper we concentrate on hadronic decays of charged higgs bosons , predicted e.g. by the minimal supersymmetric model ( see ref .",

    "decays have been analyzed in a number of publications .",
    "qcd and qed corrections were first calculated in @xcite , where it was noted that as the ratio of mass of the decaying scalar particle to that of fermions in the final state increases , the one - loop corrections diverge logarithmically .",
    "this problem was solved by renormalizing mass of quarks at the energy scale equal to the mass of the decaying particle and thus absorbing the large correction into the tree level decay rate expressed in terms of the running mass .",
    "this approach was subsequently extended by means of the renormalization group technique in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a clear summary ) , where next - to - leading qcd corrections were summed up in the case of large mass of the higgs boson .",
    "the effect of three - loop qcd corrections was first calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite and further analyzed in ref .",
    "leading logarithmic approximation and various ways to parametrize the next - to - leading corrections to the standard model higgs boson are subject of several recent studies @xcite .    in the minimal extension of the standard model suggested by supersymmetry",
    "there are two higgs boson doublets , and one of the charged modes becomes physical .",
    "it is therefore of great importance to look at the phenomenology of such charged scalar particles , since their discovery would give information about the theory underlying the standard model .",
    "various radiative corrections to hadronic decays of charged scalar particles have been calculated and published recently .",
    "one - loop qcd corrections and the sum of leading logarithms can be found in @xcite and the leading electroweak effects in the limit of large mass of the top quark in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to apply the renormalization group technique to calculate next - to - leading qcd corrections to the process @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 represent generic up and down type quarks respectively . in section [ formalism ]",
    "we describe the theoretical framework of this calculation , and in [ rencon ] we present the calculation of the two - loop mass and wave function renormalization constants of a charged higgs boson .",

    "i we have a = m_u , b = - m_d , [ eq : abi ] whereas in model ii , which corresponds to the higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric standard model : a = m_u , b = m_d , [ eq : abii ] and @xmath19 is the ratio of vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets .",
    "we now describe the procedure of calculating next - to - leading qcd contributions to the coefficient function @xmath20 . following ref .",
    "@xcite and using methods described in @xcite one derives the renormalization group equation for the space - like values of the argument of @xmath7 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the solution to this equation is found in form of an expansion in the qcd coupling constant @xmath22 and in the ratios of masses @xmath23 ( below we shall also use a common notation for the quark masses , @xmath24 ) . keeping only first two terms in the mass expansion",
    "is justified in the region far above the threshold of the @xmath25 production ; near the threshold not only this expansion is insufficient , but also the perturbative treatment of the vacuum polarization diagrams is questionable .    while the general method follows closely ref .",
    "@xcite and needs no further discussion here , we want to concentrate on the novel feature of the present calculation , namely on the computation of the renormalization constants of the charged higgs boson .",
    "we work in @xmath26 dimensional space , considering @xmath27 to be anticommuting with other @xmath28-matrices , @xmath29 .",
    "we may use such a scheme because there is no anomaly problem in the case considered ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "although eqs .",

    "we now want to visualize the magnitude of the leading and next - to - leading order corrections",

    "@xcite , for both reactions @xmath77 and @xmath78 . to our knowledge , the corrections in model i have not been analyzed so far even in the leading order .",

    "it turns out that although the leading corrections decrease the expected width of the charged higgs boson , the next - to - leading terms can increase it by a large factor , especially for the light mass of the higgs . on the other hand , this effect may be an artifact of the choice of the threshold condition .",
    "the sensitivity of the result to this choice is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : widthvsmass ] , where we present the results using two different conditions : ( a , b ) @xmath82 and ( c ) @xmath83 ( where @xmath84 denotes the running mass of the quark ) .",
    "the dependence on the initial condition has also been discussed in much detail in ref .  @xcite .",
    "size of corrections also strongly depends on the value of @xmath19 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : widthvstan ] . for this plot",
    "we have used the usual condition @xmath82 , and we see that for large @xmath19 , where the decay is dominated by the coupling proportional to the bottom quark mass , next - to - leading corrections slightly decrease the effect of the leading ones . therefore , the effect of increasing the width mentioned above is due to the corrections to the mass of the top quark ; this may be a signal of insufficiency of the expansion in @xmath85 for lighter higgs bosons .",
    "we are going to address this issue in future ( see also ref .",
    "the same term in the lagrangian which is responsible for the decay of the charged higgs boson into quarks will also enable a sufficiently heavy top quark to decay into a bottom quark and an @xmath87 .",
    "both electroweak @xcite and qcd @xcite corrections to this decay have been studied at the one - loop level .",
    "it has been found @xcite that in the two higgs doublet model predicted by supersymmetry the relative size of qcd corrections becomes large for growing values of @xmath19 .",
    "we would like to discuss this effect here in order to demonstrate that this large correction can be absorbed in the born rate if one uses the running mass of the @xmath18 quark , just like in the case of the standard model higgs boson @xcite .",
    "for this purpose we compute the tree level decay rate in the limit of very large @xmath19 and mass of the top quark : ^(0 ) ( t h^+ b ) & = & | v_tb|^2 ( 1-^2)^2 , where we have introduced the following notation for the ratios of relevant masses : = m_bm_t , = m_hm_t ( m_h m_h^+ ) . the first order qcd corrections , calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , can be expressed in the limit of large @xmath19 by : ^(1)(t h^+ b)&=&_s6g_f m^3_t |v_tb|^2 ^2 , and the explicit formulae for the coefficient functions @xmath88 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we only need terms of the order of @xmath89 : g_+ & & 34(1-^2)^2 , + g_- & & 3(1-^2 ) , + g_0 & & -32(1-^2)^2 . using these expressions",
    "we can calculate the asymptotic value of first order corrections for large values of @xmath19 and @xmath80 : ^(1)=2_s ( ) ^(0 ) .",
    "[ eq : asym ] we see that for @xmath90 , @xmath91 gev and @xmath92 gev this correction is of the order of @xmath93 , in agreement with diagrams presented in @xcite .",
    "the size of corrections becomes even larger as the mass of the top quark increases , and eventually the one - loop corrected rate of decay becomes negative ; such large corrections are a sign of a breakdown of the perturbation theory .",
    "however , it is possible to avoid the large corrections by renormalizing the mass of the @xmath18 quark not on the mass - shell but at the energy scale characteristic to the process , which is the mass of the top quark .",
    "the running mass of the bottom quark at this energy is : _ b(m_t^2)=m_b ( ) ^12/(33 - 2n_f ) , [ eq : run ] where @xmath94 is the number of quark flavours , and we take @xmath95 mev ( in the @xmath96 scheme ) . we can expand the above expression in a series in the coupling constant @xmath97 , and we find that : _",
    "b(m_t^2)m_b ( 1+_s ( ) ) .",
    "it can now be seen from the formula ( [ eq : asym ] ) that for large @xmath19 and @xmath80 the one - loop corrected decay rate approaches the born rate expressed in terms of the running @xmath18 quark mass . in figure",
    "[ fig : top ] we show the dependence of decay rate of the top quark on @xmath19 .",
    "we note that for large values of @xmath19 the qcd corrected rate is not much different from the born rate expressed in terms of the running @xmath18 quark mass ( [ eq : run ] ) , and that we no longer face the problem of unreasonably large corrections .    on the other hand , for the small values of @xmath19",
    "the born rate remains approximately unchanged when expressed in terms of the running @xmath18 mass .",
    "the reason for this is that the dominant coupling of the quarks to the charged higgs is @xmath98 in this region and mass of the @xmath18 quark does not play any important role .",
    "the same can be said about the analysis of the top quark decay in the non - supersymmetric two higgs doublet model , and it explains why no large logarithmic corrections were found there for any values of @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "we have found leading and next - to - leading order corrections to the decay width of the charged higgs boson in the framework of two models . in the case of the leading corrections in the model motivated by supersymmetry we confirmed the previously published formulae @xcite ; the remaining results are new . for a heavy higgs boson or for large values of @xmath19",
    "we found that the next - to - leading order corrections sizably decrease the effect of the leading order corrections , and increase the final result for the decay rate .",
    "we have also examined the process @xmath99 , explaining the origin of large logarithmic corrections found in a previous paper @xcite .",
