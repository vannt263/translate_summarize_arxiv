    "advanced divertor geometries such as snowflake or super - x divertors @xcite are presently investigated as alternative configurations for future reactors , with an effort to provide solutions for power exhaust issues .",
    "the major aim is to effectively reduce power loads to divertor targets which could , in large devices , exceed a tolerable maximum set by material limits . in this paper",
    ", we study the effects of the super - x divertor which will be installed on the mast tokamak @xcite .",
    "another expected benefit of such divertor is an improved closure , hence higher neutral pressure in the divertor , but limited penetration of fuelling species neutrals and impurities into the region above the x - point .",
    "2d sol transport codes such as solps @xcite have proven to be helpful in quantifying the effects of geometry on the divertor performance and have been used to support the divertor design , e.g. on iter @xcite . on the mast tokamak , recent solps5.0 simulations focused on optimization of the baffle positioning with respect to retaining the divertor closure , but avoiding large flux on the baffle surfaces @xcite .",
    "the effect of the super - x divertor was preliminarily investigated also in @xcite by solps5.0 and in @xcite by a 1d code solf1d .",
    "some of the latest results also concentrate on drift effects @xcite .    here",
    "we focus on the overall impact of the super - x topology on the divertor performance in attached plasmas without impurity puffing .",
    "simulations are based on two configurations proposed for mast upgrade ( mast - u ) : ( i ) a short - legged divertor ( cd : the conventional divertor ) which is closer to divertors in present machines ( section 3 ) , ( ii ) a long - leg divertor ( sxd : the super - x divertor ) with more complex magnetic topology employing additional poloidal coils in order to increase the connection length @xmath0 and expand the plasma to larger radius ( section 4 ) .",
    "a potential to optimize the effect of sxd in high density regimes and seeded plasmas will be discussed at the next stage .    beside a direct comparison of the two configurations for inter - elm h - mode plasmas ,",
    "the sensitivity of results to various factors has been studied .",
    "this includes scans for both physics parameters ( such as input power to the sol , density , radial transport coefficients , sputtering , gas puff location ) and simulation parameters ( e.g. fluid versus kinetic neutrals , heat flux limiters ) . as a baseline for mast - u predictions , solps5.0 results for mast discharges , both l - mode and h - mode ,",
    "are currently being validated against experiment as a separate work . with regards to limits of the codes as solps and common problems with the interpretation of experimental results , the paper focuses on a comparative study of cd and sxd , rather than trying to quantitatively",
    "reproduce a mast experiment .",
    "the study presented here is extended in @xcite from low density attached conditions to high density and detached regimes .",
    "the divertor design for mast - u offers large flexibility in terms of magnetic topology .",
    "one of the possible configurations is a conventional divertor shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_grid ] .",
    "solps5.0 including eirene is used to study inter - elm h - mode plasmas in this magnetic configuration with parameters typical for current mast h - mode discharges .",
    "this section is to give a summary of main results for the conventional divertor for the purpose of comparison with results for the super - x magnetic configuration in the second part of the paper .",
    "we define a case ( a ) with @xmath1 mw ( the total input power to the grid ) , @xmath2 m@xmath3 ( the density at the inner boundary of the grid ) . the temperature and density drop across the pedestal is imposed by a transport barrier in perpendicular diffusivities ( fig . [ fig_dchi ] ) which are otherwise poloidally uniform .",
    "these diffusivities are based on @xcite and an earlier benchmarking of solps with experiment @xcite .",
    "as the sol collisionality and the sol width are important parameters of the sol , we analyze three additional simulations defined in tab . [ table_runs ] : case ( b ) with larger radial transport assuming @xmath4 m@xmath5s@xmath6 and @xmath7 m@xmath5s@xmath6 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_dchi ] as dashed line ) , case ( c ) with twice larger @xmath8 , case ( d ) with twice lower @xmath9 .",
    "while the case ( d ) gives sol temperatures comparable to those observed in the current mast experiment , the case ( a ) allows for larger heating power available in mast - u . the case ( b )",
    "will be referred to as l - mode ( here meaning wider sol , noting that l - mode in mast is usually a low power ohmic plasma , below 1.7 mw ) .",
    ".definition of four solps simulations considered in the paper . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the 2d sol modelling code solps has been used for a detailed comparison of example conventional and super - x divertor plasmas in mast . although it is known that standard sol transport codes encounter problems to reproduce high density experiments and have limitations in the physics they presently include , the codes are powerful for comparative studies where they can capture essential trends .",
    "the picture of the sol transport is simplified in the sense that laminar transport is assumed on a constant - in - time magnetic equilibrium , radial transport is fixed and constrained typically as diffusive , kinetic and mhd effects are neglected , as is non - diffusive transport due to 3d turbulence ( which would affect the value and nature of the sol width ) .",
    "this approach limits the predictive capability of the codes ( e.g. to determine the sol width ) , but can be used to study parallel plasma transport from the core along the field lines to the divertor .",
    "the codes have special strength in coupling with monte carlo description of neutral transport which allows to capture essential atomic physics playing an important role in the divertor modelling .",
    "neutral - neutral collisions are not taken into account , but we do not expect them to have a significant effect in the studied cases as the input power and the neutral pressure in the divertor are not high enough .",
    "two divertor geometries  the conventional divertor ( cd ) and the super - x divertor ( sxd )  are confronted in conditions of an inter - elm h - mode mast experiment with similar conditions in the core and upstream sol .",
    "four baseline simulations with different density , input power and radial transport are considered for each configuration , all with attached and non seeded plasmas and similar range of upstream parameters in cd and sxd ( the temperatures of 62114 ev in cd and 5881 ev in sxd , the densities of 0.91.7 @xmath10 m@xmath3 ) .",
    "as simulated by solps , the sxd configuration of mast - u proves to significantly reduce the target energy fluxes even for attached hot plasma ( a factor of 5.29.1 in our simulations compared to a factor of 4.3 caused by flux expansion ) .",
    "the target temperatures drop , allowing an earlier transition to the detachment ( here by a factor of 3.27.1 from the sheath - limited sol in cd with @xmath11 ev to the high - recycling sol with @xmath12 ev in sxd ) .",
    "the effect of sxd on reducing the peak target energy flux is larger in regimes with higher density and wider sol in which larger volumetric power loss is achieved . as continuation , a comparison at high densities and detached regimes is presented in @xcite .",
    "note that drift effects have not been tested in the frame of this paper , however , they have been studied for mast separately in @xcite .",
    "the key role is played by the poloidal @xmath13 drift , which in a connected double null configuration results in an asymmetry of the plasma parameters in the top and bottom divertors . in @xcite , the change in the electron temperature varies between @xmath14% at the outer targets and this can for example affect the divertor detachment .",
    "the divertor closure with respect to neutrals is increased in mast upgrade thanks to the separation of the upper sol and divertor regions by a baffle and in sxd with respect to cd thanks to the shorter ionization mean free path of the recycled neutrals and longer distance between the neutral source and the x - point .",
    "the ratio between the ionization source outside the divertor and the total ionization source is reduced by a factor of 10 compared to the standard mast divertor . as the result ,",
    "the flux of neutral species to the core is reduced , here by a factor of 4 for deuterium atoms and a factor of 12 for molecules .",
    "the divertor in sxd is also more closed for impurities , as the power radiated by carbon in sxd is increased in the sol , while reduced in the core .    in sxd with twice longer connection length , approximately twice more power is removed from the plasma in the sol volume before reaching the target by radiation and collisional processes ( mainly charge exchange ) .",
    "the region from which the power loss occurs expands with increased @xmath0 in the direction of magnetic field lines .",
    "the effect of sxd on reducing the power deposited at the target and the peak energy flux at the target also seems to increase with increased carbon sputtering yield .",
    "for the same @xmath15 and @xmath16 in cd and sxd , the sol width at the midplane is the same both in terms of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , while @xmath19 and @xmath20 broaden at the target in sxd thanks to the magnetic topology .",
    "opposed to expectations , @xmath19 mapped to the midplane is comparable in cd and sxd and no obvious @xmath19 broadening is found with increased @xmath0 as the result of radial diffusion .",
    "the reason is cooler plasma in the divertor in sxd in these cases and conduction dominated parallel heat transport , thanks to which a steeper @xmath21 in sxd leads to stronger parallel losses cancelling the effect of the longer parallel distance .",
    "if cd had a similar target temperature , the sxd advantages would be expected to be stronger . from the simulation",
    ", it also appears that the parallel loss time for energy can not be approximated by the often used expression @xmath22 which misrepresents the dependence on @xmath0 .    in summary , this study has shown in detail where the sxd and cd differ and thus can guide future research to optimise the benefits of long - leg divertor configurations .",

    "flux expansion between the midplane and target , relating the target wetted area to the area in the upstream sol , @xmath23 consists of the toroidal flux expansion @xmath24 ( related to the @xmath25 coordinate , i.e. the toroidal magnetic field @xmath26 ) , the poloidal flux expansion @xmath27 ( related to the poloidal magnetic field @xmath28 ) and the expansion due to the target plate tilting @xmath29 , @xmath30 here , @xmath31 is the target coordinate , @xmath32 is the radial coordinate at the midplane , @xmath33 is the angle between the field line and the target in the poloidal plane , @xmath34 is the pitch angle . in the poloidal plane , the flux tube width expansion between the upstream and target locations can be expressed in terms of the poloidal flux expansion @xmath35 using the condition of the constant poloidal magnetic flux on a flux tube @xmath36 ( @xmath37 is the flux tube width and we assume @xmath38 ) .    the reduction of the energy flux between cd ( index 1 ) and sxd ( index 2 ) due to geometry effects can be estimated from a comparison of the target wetted areas . the parallel energy flux for the same input power changes due to the flux expansion as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the wetted area at the target normal to the parallel direction .",
    "using @xmath41 , the area can be expressed in upstream quantities .",
    "if we assume the same conditions in the upstream sol for both configurations , the quantities expressed in the upstream location cancel and the final expression takes the form @xmath42 i.e. the parallel energy flux in sxd is reduced by the effect of the magnetic topology due to the toroidal flux expansion . the reduced poloidal magnetic field in sxd accounts for the drop of the poloidal energy flux",
    "@xmath43 as @xmath44 and the target power load @xmath45 is reduced as @xmath46 involving also the expansion due to the target tilting ."
