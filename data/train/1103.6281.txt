    "velocity dependent relativistic mass is still popular in teaching of relativity and especially in popular literature .",
    "several authors have criticized the use of this historically outdated notion @xcite while others find the concept useful @xcite .",
    "the usage of relativistic mass and `` einstein s most famous equation @xmath0 '' @xcite was quite ubiquitous in old textbooks .",
    "so why should we bother ?",
    "if such renowned experts in the field as tolman , born and fock in the past and penrose and rindler today find the concept of relativistic mass useful why not to follow the motto `` all true believers break their eggs at the convenient end '' @xcite instead of entering in an endless and arid dispute between big - endians and little - endians ?",
    "the answer is simple .",
    "modern physics offers a picture of reality which is completely different from the classical newtonian picture .",
    "it is impossible to master this kind of reality if you try to put it in a procrustean bed of newtonian concepts .",
    "nevertheless this is exactly what the modern education is trying to do . and not only in the realm of special relativity .",
    "`` most elementary textbooks and popularization works about quantum physics remain plagued by archaic wordings and formulations '' @xcite .",
    "modern civilization depends on advances in science more than ever before . on the other hand",
    "the current practice of teaching does not cultivate the conceptual critical thinking skills and is still oriented on the authoritarian teaching traditions .",
    "archaic concepts in teaching obscure vision of the world offered by modern physics . `` upon failure to develop this vision , necessarily critical ,",
    "we can find ourselves in a world of machines , both physical and intellectual , that would work fairly well , but we would not understand them any more .",
    "this means that the progress of science is not guaranteed '' @xcite .",
    "the concept of mass in modern physics is quite different from the newtonian concept of mass as a measure of inertia .",
    "however , this does not mean that we should throw out mass as a measure of inertia .",
    "simply modern physics framework is more general and flexible and it explicitly indicates the context under which it is fairly safe to consider the mass as a measure of inertia .",
    "the problems begin when things are turned upside down and the newtonian physics is considered as a basic truth and modern physics as some derivative from it .",
    "`` objectivity of classical physics is some sort of half - truth .",
    "it is a very good thing , a very great achievement , but somehow it makes it more difficult than it would have seemed before to understand the fullness of reality '' @xcite .    in this note",
    "we outline the way how the concept of mass is introduced in the modern physics and make it clear that this way leaves no room for relativistic mass .",
    "this archaic concept is doomed to loose its role as a portal in relativistic world if we want new generations to fully appreciate the benefits of the twentieth - century scientific revolution .",
    "of course , no disrespect is implied by the title .",
    "it is a remake of the title of philip anderson s famous article `` brainwashed by feynman ? ''",
    "@xcite and our goal of using such a title is the same : just to sharpen reader s attention to a real problem .",
    "the problem here is that modern education lags far behind the frontier of modern physics .",
    "okun remarks @xcite that the first textbook in the world in which mass was velocity - independent was `` the classical theory of fields '' by landau and lifshitz , first published in 1940 .",
    "there was a good reason why landau and lifshitz did not use relativistic mass : they had based their presentation on the principle of least action . and",
    "this method leaves little room for relativistic mass , or , rather , makes its use obsolete and unnecessary .",
    "indeed , let us consider a free relativistic particle .",
    "landau and lifshitz s reasoning goes as follows @xcite .",
    "the action integral for this particle should be independent on our choice of reference frame , according to the principle of relativity . furthermore , the integrand should be a differential of the first order .",
    "a free particle can provide only one scalar of this kind - the interval @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , for a free particle the expected form of the action is @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the light velocity and the first integral is along the world line of the particle , @xmath4 and @xmath5 being two particular events of the arrival of the particle at the initial and final positions at definite times @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is some constant and it must be positive lest the action become unbounded from below .",
    "the physical meaning of the constant @xmath8 becomes evident if we consider the non - relativistic limit of the relativistic lagrangian from ( [ eq1 ] ) : @xmath9 this is equivalent to the non - relativistic lagrangian @xmath10 if and only if @xmath11 .",
    "the way how the mass @xmath12 appeared in the relativistic lagrangian indicates clearly that it is an invariant quantity and does not depend on velocity .",
    "but how about @xmath13 which is notoriously used to introduce relativistic mass ?    simply @xmath13 is a wrong way to define momentum .",
    "it is only true in non - relativistic situations and is no longer valid when the particle velocity approaches the velocity of light @xmath3 .",
    "the modern way to introduce momentum is the noether theorem which relates symmetries of a theory with its laws of conservation . in relativity",
    ", it is better to deal with the time @xmath14 and spatial coordinates @xmath15 on equal footing .",
    "therefore , we introduce a parametrization of the particle s worldline @xmath16 where @xmath17 is some ( scalar ) evolution parameter , and rewrite the action of a dynamical system as follows @xmath18 where @xmath19 a symmetry of the action ( [ eq3 ] ) is a transformation @xmath20 under which the variation of the lagrangian can be written as a total derivative of some function @xmath21 with respect to the evolution parameter @xmath17 , @xmath22 if a dynamical system with action ( [ eq3 ] ) has a symmetry defined by ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) , then the noether s current ( einstein summation convention is assumed ) @xmath23 is conserved . indeed , using the euler - lagrange equations , which follow from the principle of least action @xmath24 , @xmath25 we get in light of ( [ eq5 ] ) @xmath26",
    "sometimes it is more convenient to express the conserved noether current in terms of the original lagrangian @xmath27 . since , @xmath28 where @xmath29 we have @xmath30 and @xmath31 therefore , in terms of the original lagrangian @xmath27 , the noether current takes the form @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the desired general definitions of momentum and energy ( hamiltonian ) of the dynamical system ( for non - relativistic lagrangian @xmath34 , the momentum takes its standard form @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the kinetic energy ) .",
    "it is now clear that the symmetry of the free relativistic particle action ( [ eq1 ] ) with respect to the infinitesimal space translations , @xmath37 leads to the momentum conservation , while the symmetry with respect to the infinitesimal time translation , @xmath38 implies the energy conservation .    from ( [ eq8 ] ) , using the relativistic lagrangian @xmath39 we get the relativistic expressions for the energy and momentum @xmath40 it follows from these equations that @xmath41 the equation ( [ eq11 ] ) expresses the most important relativistic facet of mass : for every free particle its energy - momentum four - vector has a fixed magnitude @xmath42 .",
    "an interesting question , for some unknown reasons not usually discussed in most classical mechanics textbooks , is what conserved quantity corresponds to lorentzian ( and galilean ) boosts @xcite .",
    "an infinitesimal lorentz boost in the @xmath43-direction @xmath44 is the symmetry of the action ( [ eq3 ] ) with @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , the corresponding noether current implies the conserved quantity @xmath46 or in the vector form after the invariance with regard to the other two boosts are also taken into account @xmath47 we get in fact a relativistic version of the newton s first law that a free particle moves uniformly with constant velocity @xmath48 `` you are nt used to calling this a conservation law , but it is , and in fact it is the lorentz partner of the angular momentum conservation law '' @xcite .",
    "landau and lifshitz s argument is seductive but only half true .",
    "let s see how they get the non - relativistic free particle lagrangian @xcite .",
    "homogeneity of space and time implies that @xmath27 must be independent of @xmath49 and @xmath14 , so it is a function of the particle s velocity @xmath50 and in fact a function of its magnitude only because the space is isotropic . under the infinitesimal galilei transformations @xmath51",
    "the lagrangian @xmath52 can get , at most , a variation which is a total time derivative of some function of coordinates and time ( that is galilean boosts are symmetries of the corresponding action with possibly nonzero @xmath53 ) .",
    "but under the galilei boost ( [ eq14 ] ) @xmath54 and @xmath55 this is a total time derivative if and only if @xmath56 is a constant .",
    "therefore , we can write the lagrangian as follows @xmath57 once again , the derivation makes it clear that the mass @xmath12 is a galilean invariant quantity independent of velocity .",
    "however , unlike the relativistic case , only quasi - invariance of the lagrangian is required under galilei transformations ( that the variation of the lagrangian should be a total time derivative ) .",
    "why such a difference ?",
    "it is not that we can not find the lagrangian which is invariant under galilean transformations ( [ eq14 ] ) .",
    "we can . just adding a total time derivative to the lagrangian ( [ eq15 ] ) we get the lagrangian @xmath58 which is evidently invariant under the galilean boosts @xcite : @xmath59 of course , @xmath58 explicitly depends on @xmath49 and @xmath14 .",
    "but this fact , contrary to what is claimed in @xcite , does not mean a violation of space - time homogeneity . under space - time translations",
    "@xmath60 the variation of @xmath58 is @xmath61.\\ ] ] therefore , the lagrangian @xmath58 is quasi - invariant under space - time translations and this is sufficient to ensure space - time homogeneity .    as we see , landau and lifshitz s logic , while obtaining free particle lagrangians in @xcite and @xcite , contains loopholes . to close these loopholes ,",
    "more thorough investigation is needed @xcite ( see also @xcite )",
    ".    for notational simplicity , let @xmath62 denotes a space - time point @xmath63 , and let the lagrangian @xmath64 be quasi - invariant with respect to the symmetry group @xmath65 .",
    "that is for any symmetry transformation @xmath66 , we have @xmath67 the action @xmath68 considered as a function of the trajectory end - points , transforms as follows @xmath69 lvy - leblond calls @xmath70 a gauge function . if this function has the form @xmath71 with some functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 , then we can choose a new equivalent action @xmath74 which will be invariant under all symmetry transformations from @xmath65 ( this follows simply from ( [ eq19 ] ) and ( [ eq20 ] ) ) @xmath75 in this case the gauge function @xmath70 is said to be equivalent to zero .",
    "of course , two gauge functions are essentially the same ( are equivalent ) if their difference is equivalent to zero .",
    "it is , therefore , convenient to fix the gauge and choose one representative from each equivalence class with the property @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes a conventional origin @xmath78 in space - time ( of course , any point can be chosen as the origin , due to space - time homogeneity ) .",
    "such a representative always exists because if @xmath79 , we choose as an representative an equivalent gauge function @xmath80 , with @xmath81 .",
    "the gauge functions have the following important property @xcite .",
    "the compatibility of @xmath82 and @xmath83 @xmath84 requires @xmath85 that is the function @xmath86 does not depends on the space - time point @xmath62 .",
    "some elementary cohomology terminology will be useful at this point @xcite .",
    "any real function @xmath87 will be called a cochain . the action of the coboundary operator @xmath88 on this @xmath89-cochain produces @xmath90-cochain and is determined as follows @xmath91 the coboundary operator has the following important property @xmath92 a cochain with zero coboundary is called a cocycle .",
    "because of ( [ eq24 ] ) , every coboundary @xmath93 is a cocycle .",
    "however , not all cocycles can be represented as coboundaries .",
    "such cocycles will be called nontrivial .    in fact @xmath94",
    "defined by ( [ eq22 ] ) is a cocycle . indeed , according to ( [ eq23 ] ) , @xmath95 substituting ( [ eq22 ] ) into the first three terms , we get after some cancellations @xmath96 but this is just @xmath94 , as the formula ( [ eq22 ] ) is valid for any space - time point @xmath62 , and in particular for the point @xmath97 . therefore , @xmath98 and @xmath94 is a global ( independent on a space - time point @xmath62 ) cocycle .    in the following",
    "we will assume the gauge fixing ( [ eq21 ] ) .",
    "then ( [ eq22 ] ) with @xmath99 gives @xmath100 from this relation the following two properties of the admissible cocycles follow .",
    "first , if the gauge function @xmath70 is equivalent to zero , then @xmath94 is a trivial cocycle .",
    "indeed , let @xmath101 then @xmath102 condition gives @xmath103 and , therefore , @xmath104 on the other hand , if we take ( a global ) 1-cochain @xmath105 , then its coboundary @xmath106 just coincides with the r.h.s . of ( [ eq26 ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath107 and hence it is a trivial cocycle .",
    "the second property of the admissible cocycle is that if @xmath108 belongs to the stabilizer @xmath109 of the point @xmath77 , so that @xmath110 , then @xmath111 for all @xmath66 .",
    "indeed , this is evident from ( [ eq25 ] ) and our gauge fixing condition ( [ eq21 ] ) .",
    "if the symmetry group @xmath65 acts transitively on space - time ( in fact , in this case the space - time can be identified with the homogeneous space @xmath112 @xcite ) , then for any point @xmath62 there exists such a symmetry @xmath113 that @xmath114 let @xmath94 be some admissible cocycle , that is such that @xmath115 for all @xmath66 and @xmath108 .",
    "then the formula @xmath116 defines a gauge function such that @xmath102 .",
    "indeed , first of all @xmath70 is defined by ( [ eq28 ] ) for admissible cocycles uniquely despite the fact that @xmath113 is defined by ( [ eq27 ] ) only up to stabilizer transformation , for any @xmath108 we have @xmath117 then , using @xmath118 for some @xmath108 , we can easily check that @xmath119    the only question that remains is whether the equivalent admissible cocycles can lead to nonequivalent gauge functions .",
    "the answer , in general , turns out to be affirmative @xcite .",
    "let @xmath120 and @xmath94 are two equivalent admissible cocycles , so that @xmath121 the admissibility conditions @xmath122 , if @xmath108 , produces a restriction on the cochain @xmath123 : @xmath124 in particular , ( [ eq29 ] ) shows that @xmath125 is a one - dimensional representation of the subgroup @xmath109 .",
    "the gauge functions @xmath126 and @xmath70 defined by these cocycles are related as follows @xmath127 note that @xmath128 with some @xmath129 ( in fact , @xmath130 ) . therefore , in light of ( [ eq29 ] ) , we have @xmath131 or @xmath132 with @xmath133 and @xmath134 . as we see , @xmath126 is equivalent to the gauge function @xmath135 suppose the representation @xmath136 of @xmath109 can be extended to the representation @xmath137 of the whole group @xmath65",
    ". then we will have @xmath138 and @xmath139 with @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "therefore , @xmath8 and @xmath142 are equivalent",
    ".    however , if the representation @xmath136 can not be extended on @xmath65 , then @xmath143 and @xmath70 gauge functions are essentially different ( not equivalent ) .",
    "in fact , formula ( [ eq30 ] ) makes it possible to explicitly construct all different gauge functions related to the symmetry group @xmath65 .",
    "all what is needed is to find all non - trivial two - cocycles of @xmath65 and all non - trivial one - dimensional representations of the stabilizer subgroup @xmath109 which can not be extended on @xmath65 @xcite .    in relativistic classical mechanics ,",
    "the symmetry group @xmath65 is the poincar group and the stabilizer subgroup @xmath109 is the ( homogeneous ) lorentz group .",
    "however , the poincar group has no non - trivial two - cocycles @xcite and the lorentz group has no non - trivial one - dimensional representations .",
    "therefore , all gauge functions , related to the poincar group are equivalent to zero and we conclude that it was quite safe for landau and lifshitz to assume strictly invariant relativistic action integral .    in non - relativistic case matters are somewhat more complicated .",
    "now @xmath65 is the galilei group with elements @xmath144 and it acts on the space - time points @xmath145 as follows @xmath146 where @xmath147 symbolically denotes the rotation matrix .",
    "the stabilizer subgroup @xmath109 is the homogeneous galilei group with elements @xmath148 . as in the relativistic case , @xmath109 has no non - trivial one - dimensional representations .",
    "however , the full galilei group @xmath65 has a non - trivial two - cocycle discovered by bargmann @xcite .",
    "bargmann s cocycle may be chosen in the form @xcite @xmath149 where @xmath12 is an arbitrary real number .",
    "possible gauge functions for the galilei group are uniquely specified by the equivalence classes of the bargmann cocycle that is by the number @xmath12 .",
    "we can take @xmath150 , because @xmath151 with @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "therefore , in accordance with ( [ eq30 ] ) , we obtain @xmath154 then we get the following most general transformation law of the lagrangian under galilei symmetries @xmath155 where @xmath156 is given by ( [ eq31 ] ) and @xmath157 choosing @xmath158 , we get @xmath159 therefore , @xmath160 does not depend on @xmath49 and @xmath14 , as was assumed by landau and lifshitz .",
    "but now we have a rigorous justification why we can make such a choice without loss of generality in spite of quasi - invariance of the lagrangian .",
    "hence @xmath161 and we can rewrite ( [ eq34 ] ) as follows @xmath162 for @xmath163 , we get ( note that @xmath164 ) @xmath165 the lagrangian @xmath160 is a homogeneous function of first degree in the @xmath166 and @xmath167 derivatives ( see ( [ eq3p ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is some arbitrary constant , and from ( [ eq37 ] ) we get the most general form ( up to equivalence ) of the lagrangian compatible to the galilei symmetry @xmath170 taking @xmath171 , so that @xmath172 and @xmath167 is the particle velocity , we recover the standard result @xmath173 the rest energy @xmath169 which appears in ( [ eq39 ] ) has no real significance in classical mechanics and can be omitted from ( [ eq39 ] ) without changing equations of motions .",
    "note however , that the way how this rest energy was introduced in the theory indicates that @xmath169 has no relation with the mass @xmath12 of the particle . in non - relativistic physics ( or more precisely , in galilei invariant theory ) , @xmath169 and @xmath12 are two unrelated constants characterizing the particle ( @xmath169 being insignificant as far as the classical mechanics is concerned ) .",
    "only in relativity @xmath169 and @xmath12 proved to be related by einstein s famous @xmath174 formula , as ( [ eq10 ] ) indicates ( in fact , it was max laue who produced the first general correct proof of this relation in 1911 for arbitrary closed static systems , generalized by felix klein in 1918 for arbitrary closed time - dependent systems @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , we can get a strictly invariant lagrangian if we enlarge the configuration space of the system by introducing just one additional real variable @xmath175 .",
    "indeed , let us consider the lagrangian @xmath176 it is obviously invariant upon transformations @xmath177 because @xmath178 unfortunately , transformations ( [ eq41 ] ) do not form a group . @xmath179=(g_1g_2q,\\,\\theta+\\alpha(g_2;q)+\\alpha(g_1;g_2q))=\\ ] ] @xmath180 as we see , the presence of the @xmath94 cocycle makes it impossible to define the multiplication law @xmath181 because @xmath182\\ne ( g_1g_2)(q,\\theta)$ ] .",
    "however , there is a simple way out .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ eq40 ] ) is obviously invariant under transformations @xmath183 with some constant @xmath184 .",
    "let us combine the transformations ( [ eq41 ] ) and ( [ eq42 ] ) in the following way @xmath185 then @xmath182=(g_1g_2)(q,\\theta)$ ] condition requires the following multiplication law @xmath186 it can be checked that in this case the cocycle condition @xmath187 helps to ensure the associativity of the multiplication law ( [ eq44 ] ) and the set of the @xmath188 pairs , @xmath189 , indeed form a group , the inverse element being @xmath190 note that @xmath65 is not a subgroup of @xmath189 . instead , @xmath65 is isomorphic to the factor - group @xmath191 , where @xmath192 is the abelian group of transformations ( [ eq42 ] ) ( identical to the additive group of real numbers ) .",
    "it is said that @xmath189 constitutes a central extension of @xmath65 .",
    "central extensions play an important role in physics , especially in quantum physics @xcite .",
    "although the classical theory , considered above , is completely sufficient to demonstrate our main point that the modern way of introducing mass makes it clear that it can not depend on velocity neither in galilei nor in poincar invariant theory , the real basis of modern physics is quantum theory .    through the feynman path",
    "integral formalism , the quantum theory explains the appearance of the least action principle in classical theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , `` there is no longer any need for the mystery that comes from trying to describe quantum behaviour as some strange approximation to the classical behaviour of waves and particles .",
    "instead we turn the job of explaining around .",
    "we start from quantum behaviour and show how this explains classical behaviour '' @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , modern education completely ignores this possibility and still speaks about `` wave - particle duality '' and `` the complementarity principle '' as a philosophical bases to fuse the two apparently contradictory ideas of classical particles and classical waves into a quantum concept .",
    "the following example @xcite shows that such educational practice distorts the scientific integrity even of professional physicists . in his critique of the customary interpretation of quantum mechanics , land indicated the following paradox @xcite .",
    "it seems the de broglie relationship between the momentum and wavelength @xmath193 contradicts the principle of relativity because the momentum does depend on the choice of the reference frame while the wavelength does not .",
    "an amusing fact , according to lev - leblond @xcite , is that nowadays experimentalists in neutron optics have difficulties to grasp land s paradox .",
    "they know quite well , as firmly established experimental fact , that the wavelength @xmath194 is related to the momentum @xmath195 by de broglie s @xmath196 and it _ does change _ from one inertial frame to the other .",
    "why is then land claiming that @xmath194 is an invariant ?",
    "recovered from the `` wave - particle duality '' dichotomy by their professional experience , they missed to appreciate a simple fact , as the crux of the land s argument , that `` in classical wave theory , @xmath194 indeed is an invariant : the crest - to - crest distance of sea waves is the same to an aircraft pilot and to a lighthouse keeper '' @xcite .",
    "they simply do not understand why this classical property of waves has any relation to quantum objects they study .",
    "although land s paradox has some interesting aspects related to classical special relativity @xcite , it is not a real paradox in quantum theory @xcite and originates only if we still insist on the schizophrenic classical view of the quantum world that a quantum particle somehow manages to be simultaneously both a particle and a wave while in reality it is neither particle nor wave @xcite . simply `` it must be realized today that this view of the quantum world , adapted as it was to its first explorations , is totally out - dated . in the past fifty years",

    "mathematically the land s paradox is the following .",

    "this can be shown as follows . repeating the above reasoning for the general transformations from the galilei group @xmath218 we get @xmath219 only the first two terms are relevant because the last two terms give a function of group parameters only ( independent on @xmath49 and @xmath14 ) and therefore lead to a globally trivial cocycle when substituted into ( [ eq51 ] ) . keeping only the first two terms in ( [ eq54 ] ) and taking into account ( [ eq53 ] )",
    ", we get after some algebra @xmath220 which is just the bargmann cocycle ( [ eq32 ] ) .    the way we have obtained it shows that the bargmann cocycle is locally trivial ( is the coboundary of the local cochain @xmath70 ) . however , it is globally nontrivial . indeed , any globally trivial cocycle , having the form @xmath221 , is symmetric in @xmath216 and @xmath217 on abelian subgroups .",
    "it follows from ( [ eq53 ] ) that elements of the form @xmath222 ( space translations and galilean boosts ) form an abelian subgroup : @xmath223 however , the bargmann cocycle remains asymmetric on this abelian subgroup , @xmath224 , and , therefore , it can not be a trivial cocycle .",
    "moreover , the same argument indicates that different values of mass define not equivalent bargmann cocycles because their difference , being asymmetric on the abelian subgroup of space translations and galilean boosts , is not a trivial cocycle . as we see , in non - relativistic physics , the mass of the particle has a cohomological origin , it parametrizes the central extensions of the galilei group .    in non - relativistic physics ,",
    "the mass is a primary concept and it is impossible to explain why only some central extensions of the galilei group are realized as elementary particles .",
    "relativity brings a big change in the conceptual status of mass .",

    "however , `` our understanding of the origin of mass is by no means complete . we have achieved a beautiful and profound understanding of the origin of most of the mass of ordinary matter , but not of all of it .",
    "the value of the electron mass , in particular , remains deeply mysterious even in our most advanced speculations about unification and string theory . and ordinary matter",
    ", we have recently learned , supplies only a small fraction of mass in the universe as a whole .",
    "more beautiful and profound revelations surely await discovery .",
    "we continue to search for concepts and theories that will allow us to understand the origin of mass in all its forms , by unveiling more of nature s hidden symmetries '' @xcite .",
    "v.  a.  fock once remarked that  the physics is essentially a simple science .",
    "the main problem in it is to understand which symbol means what \" @xcite .",
    "as we have seen above , the meaning of the symbol @xmath12 which enters in newton s @xmath225 equation is more profound than the primary newtonian `` measure of inertia ''",
    ". unfortunately , the modern education ignores all the twentieth century s achievements in deciphering this symbol and bases its exposition on the classical newtonian physics as it was formed at the end of the nineteenth century , with only fragmentary and eclectic inclusions from the modern physics .    not that classical physics is wrong and useless .",
    "classical physics is a great achievement of humankind and fully deserves our admiration . at the end of their excellent book on classical mechanics",
    "@xcite , sudarshan and mukunda wrote `` classical mechanics is an eternal discipline , where harmony abounds .",
    "it is beautiful in the true sense of the term .",
    "it is new every time we grow and look at it anew . if we have conveyed a sense of awe and adoration to this eternal beauty , our labor is worthwhile '' .",
    "but all the sparkling beauty of classical physics can manifest itself only when it is placed in a right framework of modern ideas .",
    "archaic notions and concepts in education , like relativistic mass , not only hinder understanding of modern physics but also they make it impossible to truly appreciate the meaning of classical ideas and the context under which classical ideas are completely sound and operational .",
    "of course we are not talking about the terminology . if you like to have a special name for the combination @xmath226 , or you feel that the relativistic mass will help a newtonian intuition of your students to better understand some relativistic circumstances , no problem , go ahead and use it .",
    "it is the philosophy of teaching which is at stake .",
    "let me try to explain by allegory .",
    "scientific progress needs an educated society and society has its special means to promote its members to higher level of education .",
    "a student under his / her search of higher education is like a mountain climber who wishes to climb up a frictionless conical mountain ( see the figure .",
    "this nice mountain climber problem is from david morin s superb textbook of introductory classical mechanics @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of teaching was to give the student a lasso ( a rope with a loop ) and explain him / her how to use it .",
    "after sufficient teaching the student throws the lasso over the top of the mountain and climbs it up along the rope .",
    "deluxe lasso was quite effective till twentieth century and with it many famous scientists climbed up the icy mountain of contemporary science and furnished the glorious building of classical physics at the end of the nineteenth century .",
    "educational standards were quite high , sometimes even unreasonably high and competitive .",
    "a good example is cambridge mathematical tripos examinations , `` a high speed marathon whose like has never been seen before or since '' @xcite .",
    "the examination lasted eight days and total number of questions was about two hundred .",
    "the results of examination were the subject of a great deal of public attention .",
    "the first man was called the senior wrangler followed by other wranglers , the candidates awarded a first - class degree . next came senior optimes , the candidates awarded a second - class degree , followed by junior optimes , the third class men .",
    "the procedure was quite cruel , some kind of darwinian natural selection at work , as the following examples illustrate .",
    "james wilson , the senior wrangler in 1859 , experienced a severe mental and physical breakdown immediately after the examination .",
    "it took three months him to recover from the illness and after the recovery he found that he had forgotten utterly all the mathematics that he had learned at cambridge apart from elementary algebra and euclid @xcite .",
    "no wonder that the deluxe lasso became more and more ineffective at the beginning of twentieth century with its drastic change both in society and science .",
    "then the cheap democratic lasso was invented ( see the figure ) .    for decades",
    "the democratic lasso worked quite well and today we have the standard model and large hadron collider .",
    "however , it seems even the democratic lasso becomes ineffective in our postmodern society .",
    "in fact , a gradual decrease of culture and intelligence is a long standing problem .",
    "already ludwig wittgenstein , an austrian philosopher , wrote in 1930 ( cited in @xcite ) : `` i realize that the disappearance of a culture does not signify the disappearance of human value , but simply of certain means of expressing this value , yet the fact remains that i have no sympathy for the current of european civilization and do not understand its goals , if it has any .",
    "so i am really writing for people who are scattered throughout the corners of the globe '' .",
    "it will be helpful to understand why lassos cease to be effective .",
    "it is just a simple mathematical exercise after the main physical essence of the problem is grasped @xcite .",
    "the key to this problem is to realize that in the absence of friction the rope s tension ensures that the path of the lasso s loop on the cone s surface must be a geodesic ( a nice discussion of geodesics on the cone s surface can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "the cone s surface is flat .",
    "let us cut it along a straight line joining the peak and the knot @xmath227 of the lasso , and roll the cone flat onto a plane .",
    "we will get a sector of a circle and the lasso s loop will be represented by a straight line @xmath228 on this sector ( after the cutting and rolling , the point @xmath227 will appear at both sides of the involute of the cone at equal distances from the tip ) .",
    "the deluxe lasso is one continuous piece of rope .",
    "therefore , at the knot all three pieces of the rope will have the same tension and we need the angles between them to be @xmath229 for the tensions to balance themselves . hence the angle between @xmath228 and @xmath230 is @xmath229 , the triangle @xmath231 is equilateral and @xmath232 .",
    "what this means for the angle @xmath8 of the cone ?",
    "let @xmath233 , then the radii of the cone s base is @xmath234 .",
    "we have two expressions for the arc - length @xmath27 of @xmath235 . from the one hand , @xmath236 . on the other hand , @xmath237 is the circumference of the cone s base . equating these two expressions , we get @xmath238 if @xmath239 , then @xmath240 and @xmath241 .",
    "therefore , only in the special circumstances of the nineteenth century can the deluxe lasso work .",
    "it becomes useless then these circumstances change .    for the democratic lasso",
    "the angle between @xmath228 and @xmath230 is no longer constrained and it will always work unless the involute of the cone is greater than a semicircle .",
    "@xmath242 implies @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "this explains why the democratic lasso worked quite well in spite of changing conditions during the twentieth century .",
    "but now , i m afraid , the conditions both in society and science changed so drastically that we have @xmath245 . therefore , the old lasso based education practise will no longer work irrespective how hard we try .",
    "modern education can no longer be based on newton s laws and newtonian concepts as primary building blocks .",
    "the progress in science was too great .",
    "quantum mechanics and special relativity are cornerstones of modern physics .",
    "it is of crucial importance the modern education to be based on basic principles of these disciplines from the very beginning .",
    "newton s laws and newtonian concepts should be introduced as derivatives from these more profound theories , as they really are , and the limitations of the newtonian concepts must be clearly stressed .",
    "without such a deep modernization of education , we will face a risk that the number of quasi - educated people will increase while the number of really intelligent people will decrease .",
    "we are already watching an alarming proliferation of irrationality and ignorance worldwide .",
    "a very clear explanation why such a situation is dangerous was given by carlo maria cipolla , an italian economic historian .",
    "according to cipolla @xcite , human beings fall into four basic categories : the helpless , the intelligent , the bandit and the stupid .",
    "if tom takes an action and suffers a loss while producing a gain to dick , tom acted helplessly .",
    "if tom takes an action by which he makes a gain while yielding a gain also to dick , tom acted intelligently .",
    "if tom takes an action by which he makes a gain causing dick a loss , tom acted as a bandit .",
    "if tom causes losses to dick or to a group of persons while himself deriving no gain and even possibly incurring losses , he is a stupid person .     whether one considers classical , or medieval , or modern or contemporary times one is impressed by the fact that any country moving uphill has its unavoidable @xmath246 fraction of stupid people .",
    "however the country moving uphill also has an unusually high fraction of intelligent people who manage to keep the @xmath246 fraction at bay and at the same time produce enough gains for themselves and the other members of the community to make progress a certainty .    in a country which is moving downhill",
    ", the fraction of stupid people is still equal to @xmath246 ; however in the remaining population one notices among those in power an alarming proliferation of the bandits with overtones of stupidity and among those not in power an equally alarming growth in the number of helpless individuals .",
    "such change in the composition of the non - stupid population inevitably strengthens the destructive power of the @xmath246 fraction and makes decline a certainty .",
    "and the country goes to hell  @xcite .",
