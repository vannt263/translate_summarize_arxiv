    "the fits were again statistically good , and for these models , the fitted values of @xmath11  were generally between 1.3 @xmath8  and 1.5 @xmath8 , which are much more reasonable values for the onset radius of wind - shock emission .",

    "unlike @xmath0  cru , the companion has lines that are narrow  unresolved at the resolution limit of the hetgs .",

    "the depopulation of the upper level of the forbidden line will be driven by collisions , rather than photoexcitation , in the case of cooler stars .",

    "the k - s test of the unbinned photon arrival times compared to a constant source model shows significant variability in all energy bands , though the significance is higher in the hard x - rays ( @xmath2 kev ) .",
    "the binned light curve also shows highly significant variability , again with the null hypothesis of a constant source rejected for the overall data , and both the soft and hard counts , separately .",
    "an overall decrease in the count rate is clearly seen as the observation progressed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : companion_lightcurve ] ) .",
    "the short rise followed by a steady decline of nearly 50% in the x - ray count rate over the remainder of the observation is qualitatively consistent with flare activity seen in late - type pms stars @xcite , although the rise is not as rapid as would be expected for a single , large flare .",
    "we examined the spectral evolution of the companion during this decay , and there is mild evidence for a softening of the spectrum at late times , but not the dramatic spectral evolution expected from a cooling magnetic loop after a flare .",
    "for example , the hardness ratio ( the difference between the count rate above 1 kev and below 1 kev , normalized by the total count rate ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : companion_hardness ] .",
    "there is a mild preference for a negative slope over a constant hardness ratio ( significant at the 95% level ) , but with the data as noisy as they are , a constant hardness ratio can not be definitively ruled out .",

    "spectrum that looks qualitatively quite different from those of o stars , with their significantly doppler broadened x - ray emission lines .",
    "specifically , the emission lines of @xmath0  cru are quite narrow , although they are resolved in the meg , with half - widths of @xmath52 km s@xmath1 . these relatively narrow lines are incompatible with the wind - shock scenario that applies to o stars if the wind of @xmath0  cru has a terminal velocity close to the expected value of @xmath53 km s@xmath1 .",
    "they are , however , consistent with a spherically symmetric outflow with a constant velocity of @xmath14 km s@xmath1 .",
    "if the wind terminal velocity is significantly less than 2000 km s@xmath1  perhaps just a few hundred km s@xmath1 above the @xmath54 km s@xmath1 maximum absorption velocity shown by the strongest of the observed uv wind lines ",
    "a wind - shock origin of the x - ray emission is possible , but still difficult to explain physically .",
    "one wind - shock scenario that we have considered relies on the fact that the low - density wind of @xmath0  cru should take a long time to cool once it is shock heated .",
    "if a large fraction of the accelerating wind flow passes through a relatively strong shock front at @xmath55 @xmath8 , where the pre - shock wind velocity may be somewhat less than 1000 km s@xmath1 , it could be decelerated to just a few 100 km s@xmath1 , explaining the rather narrow x - ray emission lines .",
    "similar onset radii are seen observationally in o stars @xcite . the hottest plasma component from the global thermal spectral modeling requires a shock jump velocity of roughly 700 km s@xmath1 , with the dominant cooler component requiring a shock jump velocity of roughly 400 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath3 ratios of ne ix and mg xi indicate that the hot plasma is either several stellar radii from the photosphere or distributed throughout the wind starting at several tenths of a stellar radius .",
    "this is broadly consistent with this scenario of an x - ray emitting outer wind .",
    "the lack of overall x - ray variability would also be broadly consistent with this quasi - steady - state wind - shock scenario . and",
    "the periodic variability seen in the hard x - rays could indicate that the shock front conditions are responding to the stellar pulsations , while the lack of soft x - ray variability would be explained if the softer x - rays come from cooling post - shock plasma in which the variability signal has been washed out .",
    "the overall level of x - ray emission is quite high given the modest wind density , which is a problem that has been long - recognized in early b stars @xcite . a large fraction of the wind is required to explain the x - ray emission . elaborating on the scenario of a shock - heated and inefficiently cooled outer wind",

    "certainly a filling factor term could multiply the mass - loss rate in the expression for the emission measure .",
    "ignoring such a finite filling factor would lead us to underestimate the mass - loss rate .",
    "however , another simplification we have made here involves the assumption of a smooth , spherically symmetric distribution .",
    "any clumping , or deviation from smoothness , in the post - shock region will lead to more emission measure for a given mass - loss rate ( and assumed @xmath56 and @xmath64 ) .",
    "ignoring this effect will lead us to overestimate the mass - loss rate .",
    "thus the mass - loss rate we calculate here of @xmath70 @xmath71 should be taken to be a crude estimate , subject to a fair amount of uncertainty .",
    "however , the two major oversimplifications in this calculation will tend to cancel each other out , as we have just described .",
    "we thus conclude that a mass - loss rate of order @xmath72 @xmath71 is sufficient to explain the observed x - ray emission , assuming a constant , slow outflow of the post - shock plasma above an onset radius of about 1.5 @xmath8 .",
    "this mass - loss rate is lower than the predictions of cak theory but significantly larger than the observed mass loss in the civ uv resonance line , implying that the actual mass - loss rate of @xmath0  cru is in fact lower than cak theory predicts , but that some of the weakness of the observed uv wind lines is due to ionization effects .",
    "of course , the presence of a large x - ray emitting volume in the outer wind provides a ready source of ionizing photons that can easily penetrate back into the inner , cool wind and boost the ionization state of metals in the wind . ] .",
    "this type of simple analysis relating the observed x - ray emission measure in early b stars to their mass - loss rate in the context of shock heating and inefficient radiative cooling in the outer wind was applied to _",
    "observations of the early b giants @xmath73 and @xmath0 cma by @xcite , who , like we have here , found lower mass - loss rates than expected from theory .",
    "a downward revision in the mass - loss rates of early b stars might not be surprising given recent work indicating that the mass - loss rates of o stars have been overestimated @xcite .    given the estimated mass - loss rate of @xmath70 @xmath71 for @xmath0  cru , we can assess the cooling time , or cooling length , of the purported wind shocks .",
    "a crude estimate of the cooling time and length of shock - heated wind material can be made by comparing the thermal energy content of the post - shock plasma ,    @xmath74    to the radiative cooling rate ,    @xmath75    these numbers come from taking expected values of the wind density based on the assumptions of spherical symmetry of the wind and a constant outflow velocity ,    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is the radial location in units of stellar radii .",
    "using @xmath69 and @xmath78 , the density is just @xmath79 @xmath38 at @xmath80 .",
    "we use temperatures of @xmath81 and @xmath82 k , given by the spectral fitting discussed in  4.1 , assuming that some of the softer thermal component is produced directly by shock heating ( rather than by radiative cooling of hotter plasma ) since the emission measure of the hot component is so small .",
    "we take the integrated line emissivity to be @xmath83 ergs s@xmath1 @xmath84 for a plasma of several million k @xcite .",
    "the characteristic cooling time thus derived ,    @xmath85    is many times longer than the characteristic flow time ,    @xmath86    thus , material shock heated to several million degrees at half a stellar radius above the surface will essentially never cool back down to the ambient wind temperature by radiative cooling , motivating the picture we have presented of a wind with an inner , cool acceleration zone and a quasi - steady - state outer region that is hot , ionized , x - ray emitting , and moving at a more - or - less constant velocity ( because it is too highly ionized to be effectively radiatively driven ) .",
    "although the scenario we have outlined above is phenomenologically plausible , there are several significant problems with it .",
    "first of all , the behavior of wind shocks produced by the line - driving instability is not generally as we have described here .",
    "such shocks tend to propagate outward at an appreciable fraction of the ambient wind velocity @xcite .",
    "whereas the scenario we have outlined involves a strong shock that is nearly stationary in the frame of the star , as one would get from running the wind flow into a wall .",
    "there is , however , no wall for the wind to run into .",
    "it is conceivable that a given shock front forms near @xmath87 @xmath8 and propagates outward , with another shock forming behind it ( upstream ) at roughly the same radius , so that the ensemble of shocks is close to steady state .",
    "however , the narrow observed x - ray lines severely limit the velocity of the shock front , as the post - shock velocity in the star s frame must be greater the shock front s velocity . yet",
    "the observed lines are consistent with a post - shock flow of only @xmath68 km s@xmath1 .",
    "a related , second , problem with the scenario is that the shocks required to heat the plasma to @xmath88 to @xmath82 k are relatively strong for a weak wind .",
    "smaller velocity dispersions are seen in statistical analyses of the ldi - induced structure in o star winds @xcite .",
    "perhaps the purported wind shocks could be seeded by pulsations at the base of the wind .",
    "seeding the instability at the base has been shown to lead to stronger shocks and more x - ray emission @xcite , though the shocks still propagate relatively rapidly away from the star .",
    "another problem with this scenario is the very large x - ray production efficiency that is implied .",
    "again , this general problem  that early b stars produce a lot of x - rays given their weak winds  has been known for quite some time .",
    "quantifying it here , using the outer wind shock scenario presented above , and the mass - loss rate of @xmath70 @xmath71 implied by this analysis , an appreciable fraction of the wind material is heated to x - ray emitting temperatures at any given time . and since the wind must be nearly completely decelerated when it passes through the shock front , a similar fraction of the available wind kinetic energy would go into heating the wind to @xmath89 k. the self - excited ldi typically is much less efficient than this @xcite .",
    "if this scenario of a nearly completely shocked - heated outer wind with a low velocity is not likely , then what are the alternatives ?",
    "as already stated , a more standard model of embedded wind shocks formed by the ldi and outflowing with the wind can not explain the very modest x - ray emission line widths nor the relatively large emission measures ( or shock heating efficiency ) .",
    "however , a standard coronal - type scenario , as applied successfully to cool stars , can not explain the data either .",
    "coronal sources do not have emission lines that can be resolved in the _ chandra _ hetgs . and",
    "the @xmath3 ratios would be lower than observed if the hot plasma were magnetically confined near the surface of the star .",
    "and of course , there is no reasonable expectation of a strong dynamo in ob stars .",
    "the relative softness and lack of variability would also seem to argue against an origin for the x - rays in a traditional corona at the base of the wind .    perhaps magnetic fields are involved , but just not in the context of a dynamo and corona .",
    "magnetic channeling of hot - star winds has been shown to efficiently produce x - rays and that x - ray emission has only modestly broad emission lines @xcite .",
    "there is , however , no indication that @xmath0  cru has a magnetic field .",
    "however , a field of only @xmath90 g would be sufficiently strong to channel the low - density wind of @xmath0  cru .",
    "the degree of magnetic confinement and channeling can be described by the parameter    @xmath91    where values of @xmath92 imply strong magnetic confinement and @xmath93 is the equatorial field strength for an assumed dipole field @xcite .",
    "we note that a stronger field has already been detected in another @xmath0  cephei star , @xmath0 cep itself @xcite , though attempts to detect a field on @xmath0  cru have not yet been successful @xcite .",
    "the upper limits on the field strength are roughly an order of magnitude higher than what would be needed for significant confinement and channeling , though .",
    "we also note that the radius of the last closed loop scales as @xmath94 @xcite , so a field of 50 g  still undetectable  would lead to a magnetosphere with closed field lines out to 3 @xmath8 , consistent with the value found for @xmath27 in  4.1.3 .    in a more speculative scenario",
    ", it is possible that the material giving rise to the x - ray emission is near the base of the wind , and is falling back toward the star  a failed wind .",
    "this scenario has been invoked to explain the x - ray emission from @xmath95 sco ( b0.2 v ) @xcite , which subsequently had a complex surface magnetic field detected on it @xcite . if material gets accelerated off the surface by radiation pressure , but after moving a distance off the surface finds that it can no longer be accelerated  perhaps because of the formation of optically thick clumps - those clumps may stall or even fall back toward the star and interact with the ambient wind , leading to shock heating of wind material and material on the surfaces of the clumps .",
    "the problems with this scenario include the ad hoc nature of the clump formation and wind fall - back ( though this behavior is in fact seen in conjunction with magnetic channeling @xcite ) and the @xmath3 ratios which indicate that the hot material is several stellar radii above the surface .",
    "_ chandra _ observations of @xmath95  sco do show @xmath3 ratios consistent with hot plasma significantly above the photosphere and they also show only modestly broadened x - ray emission lines , similar to what we see in @xmath0  cru , although the spectrum of @xmath95  sco is significantly harder @xcite .    finally , perhaps the physical characteristics of a wind with a slow , hot outer component that we described in our initial scenario is correct  that is what the @xmath3 ratios and the line widths are telling us  but the heating mechanism is not ldi - related wind shocks . instead a more complete plasma treatment may be required to describe at least the outer wind , where the densities are below @xmath96 @xmath38 . in such low density winds , the radiatively driven ions can decouple from the protons and rapidly accelerate , leading to frictional heating @xcite .",
    "heating to x - ray emitting temperatures is predicted to occur only at about spectral type b5 @xcite , but perhaps if the wind mass - loss rates of b stars are lower than anticipated significant frictional heating could occur in early b stars , like @xmath0  cru .",
    "we point out that the energy requirements for heating the low density ( @xmath97 @xmath38 ) outer wind of @xmath0  cru are not severe at all .",
    "the heating mechanism might even involve wave propagation if there is even a weak magnetic field on this star . and",
    "once significantly heated , such low density circumstellar matter will tend to remain hot , due to the inefficiency of radiative cooling @xcite . in this sense , the hot plasma in the wind of @xmath0  cru",
    "could be considered a corona , and though likely initiated by radiation pressure as described in cak theory , the low - density , slow , far wind of @xmath0  cru might even be driven by gas pressure gradients .",
    "none of these scenarios of x - ray production on @xmath0  cru are both physically natural and also in agreement with all the available data .",
    "although , if a magnetic field were to be detected on @xmath0  cru , then the magnetically channeled wind shock interpretation would be quite reasonable .",
    "however , we stress that the main characteristics that constrain any models that may be put forward are quite secure : the plasma temperature is several million degrees ; the emission is not highly variable , except for the periodic hard x - ray variability ; the x - ray emission lines are broadened but only modestly so ; and the x - ray production efficiency ( if the x - ray emission is related to the star s wind ) is rather high . finally , we note that the periodic signal in the hard x - rays and its phasing with the radial velocity variability might be a clue to the x - ray production mechanism .    put in the context of the empirical x - ray spectral properties of ob stars , the case of @xmath0  cru may be extreme but it seems to lie at one end of a continuum of line - profile behavior in hot stars with radiation - driven stellar winds .",
    "the late - type o stars @xmath98 ori @xcite and @xmath99 ori a @xcite have lines that are broad , but not as broad as would be expected in the standard wind - shock scenario given their known wind properties .",
    "perhaps there is a gradual transition from stars with x - ray emission lines consistent with their fast stellar winds , such as @xmath100  pup @xcite and @xmath100  ori @xcite , through some late o stars with x - ray lines of intermediate width , to early b stars like @xmath0  cru for which _ chandra _ can barely resolve their lines .    the newly discovered companion to @xmath0  cru is most likely a low - mass pre - main - sequence star , similar to the post t tauri stars found in the _ rosat _ data @xcite .",
    "it has a hard , thermal spectrum as pms stars do , and shows significant variability , again , as pms stars do @xcite .",
    "the age of @xmath0  cru is less than the pre - main - sequence lifetimes of most low - mass stars . @xcite",
    "identified a few dozen b stars with likely pms companions .",
    "if this newly discovered companion indeed is a pms star , then @xmath0  cru would be a lindroos binary .",
    "as such , it would be useful for testing evolutionary models if an optical spectrum of the companion can be obtained .",
    "it would be especially helpful if enough information about the mid - b spectroscopic companion ( which is supposed to still be on the main sequence @xcite ) can also be obtained .",
    "there are systematic age differences as a function of spectral type in the lcc which seem to reflect problems with models @xcite , and the analysis of the three coeval stars in the @xmath0  cru system could provide important constraints on the evolutionary models .",
    "given the companion s x - ray luminosity of nearly @xmath101 ergs s@xmath1 @xmath41 at the assumed distance of 108 pc , even a g star somewhat above the main sequence would have a @xmath102 ratio consistent with those seen in pms stars .",
    "the nearby k and m post - t tauri stars detected in the _ rosat _ pointing are typically @xmath103 and have @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "if the companion has a similar x - ray - to - v - magnitude flux ratio , then it is a @xmath105 magnitude pms k star .",
    "if the magnitude difference between @xmath0  cru and this newly discovered companion is roughly 11 , then at a separation of 4 and with the primary being so bright , detecting it with a ground - based optical or ir telescope will be a challenge , though such data would obviously be very useful for confirming its pms status and characterizing its properties .",
    "any accretion disk it might have would be significantly irradiated by uv light from the primary .",
    "finally , given a projected separation of 430 au , the companion should have an orbital period ( around @xmath0  cru and its spectroscopic companion ) of at least 1000 years .",
