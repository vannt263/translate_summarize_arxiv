    "two computational difficulties in simulating the emission of gravitational waves from black hole interactions are the existence of a singularities inside the black holes and a consistent treatment of the outer boundary so that the waveform of the gravitational radiation can be accurately extracted .",
    "fortunately , the observable waves emanate only from the region outside the black holes and can be simulated , without loss of physical content , in a domain from which the singularities have been excised by introducing inner boundaries inside the black holes . however , the treatment of this domain by cauchy evolution has had limited success .",
    "we present here a quasi - linear model excision problem whose mathematical analysis is simple enough to reveal some underlying computational pitfalls and the means to avoid them .",
    "in particular , we show that an accurate simulation of this model excision problem can be obtained by ( i ) blending together two evolution algorithms , one of which is well - posed near the outer boundary and the other well - posed near the inner boundary , where a superluminal evolution is employed , and ( ii ) incorporating discrete conservation laws which control spurious exponential growth .",
    "the results are aimed at numerical formulations of the einstein equation as second order quasi - linear wave equations , such as in recent harmonic approaches  @xcite .",
    "the problem can be illustrated by considering the propagation of scalar waves on the fixed background geometry of a spherically symmetric schwarzschild black hole .",
    "a choice of coordinates commonly adopted in numerical work for excising the singular region are ingoing eddington - finkelstein coordinates @xmath0 , in which the schwarzschild spacetime metric @xmath1 is given by @xmath2 here , the spacetime is foliated by the spacelike cauchy hypersurfaces @xmath3 , which are used to carry out the numerical evolution .",
    "the radial coordinate extends from the location of the singularity at @xmath4 to the asymptotic region @xmath5 , to which the radiation propagates .",
    "the black hole is located at @xmath6 . in the excision strategy ,",
    "the simulation is carried out in a region @xmath7 , where the inner boundary satisfies @xmath8 and the outer boundary ( introduced for the purpose of a finite coordinate range ) satisfies @xmath9 .",
    "the covariant wave equation for a scalar field @xmath10 is @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the inverse metric . in the above",
    "coordinates , it takes the explicit form @xmath14    although this wave equation is non - singular and can be reduced to symmetric hyperbolic form in the region @xmath7 , it has some notable features which complicate a numerical treatment :    * the appearance of the mixed @xmath15 derivative .",
    "this is an effect of the eddington - finkelstein coordinates in which the @xmath16 observers are moving relative to the time slicing . in the standard adm  @xcite formalism , this gauge effect is described as a non - vanishing _ shift _",
    ", described by the shift vector @xmath17 where @xmath18 * the change in sign of the coefficient of @xmath19 in passing across the black hole .",
    "this change in sign does not affect the hyperbolicity of the wave equation but it creates a horizon at @xmath6 across which waves can not pass to the exterior . for @xmath20 ,",
    "the @xmath16-observers move on timelike worldlines ; for @xmath6 , these worldlines are lightlike ; and for @xmath21 , they are spacelike .",
    "thus , inside the horizon the @xmath22 direction becomes spacelike , i.e. an evolution based upon grid points with constant @xmath23 is superluminal inside the horizon .",
    "* the energy density on the cauchy hypersurface @xmath3 associated with a timelike vector @xmath24 is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the unit timelike normal to the cauchy hypersurface and @xmath27 is the energy momentum tensor of the scalar field @xmath10 . in this paper",
    "we use the conserved energy associated with the choice @xmath28 , defined by @xmath29 , whose flow leaves the schwarzschild metric invariant",
    ". however , the corresponding energy density @xmath30 is positive - definite and provides a norm for the scalar field only for @xmath20 , where @xmath31 is timelike . inside the horizon",
    ", @xmath31 is spacelike and @xmath32 represents momentum rather than energy density .",
    "this complicates the use of the energy method for establishing a stable algorithm in the interior of the horizon .",
    "the non - conserved energy associated with the choice @xmath33 does provide a global norm but we will not pursue that direction here . instead , we use mode analysis to treat the inner region .",
    "these features are further complicated by the consideration of proper boundary conditions for a numerical treatment .",
    "they are not peculiar to a second differential order treatment .",
    "in particular , all these features are prominent in a model excision problem based upon a first order symmetric hyperbolic treatment of the linear wave equation ( [ eq : swave ] ) carried out in cartesian coordinates  @xcite .",
    "they are also prominent in another second order discussion of the excision problem  @xcite , in which the energy norm associated with the choice @xmath33 is used to treat the stability of the evolution algorithm ( [ eq : hlinwave ] ) which we adopt for the superluminal case .",
    "we study the numerical simulation of the excision problem by introducing a model 1-dimensional system which retains all the geometric features of the full problem . in the domain @xmath34",
    ", we consider the quasi - linear wave equation @xmath35 where the coefficients are smooth and satisfy @xmath36 and @xmath37 for @xmath38 and @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "these conditions ensure that the @xmath41-foliation is spacelike , that the metric determinant satisfies the lorentzian requirement @xmath42 , that the outer boundary @xmath40 is timelike and that the inner boundary @xmath38 is spacelike .",
    "the shift vector has component @xmath43 .",
    "we also require , analogous to ( [ eq : shift ] ) , that @xmath44 at @xmath38 , which ensures that the inner boundary is oriented so that all characteristics leave the domain .",
    "there is an event horizon at @xmath45 across which waves can not pass in the outer direction . for initial data satisfying @xmath46 , the cauchy problem for this equation is well - posed .",
    "the non - linearity is introduced into ( [ eq : nlwave ] ) in order to model another computational difficulty related to the full einstein equations . when harmonic coordinates are introduced to fix the gauge freedom , the einstein equations reduce to quasi - linear equations for the components of the metric whose principle part is identical to ( [ eq : gnl ] ) . in these harmonic coordinates ,",
    "there exists pure gauge solutions ( flat metrics ) @xmath47 where @xmath48 which describing traveling waves with profile @xmath49 .",
    "the simulation of ( [ eq : shgw ] ) is one of the standardized tests proposed in the `` apples with apples '' project  @xcite , whose purpose is to compare different numerical treatments of the einstein equations .",
    "the accuracy of the simulation is complicated by the existence of exponentially growing gauge waves  @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 which solve the same equations and can not be damped by dissipative techniques . for @xmath52 ,",
    "the cauchy data for ( [ eq : shlgw ] ) approximate the cauchy data for the test gauge wave ( [ eq : shgw ] ) .",
    "the excitation of this exponential error mode can dominate the simulation after a relatively short time .",
    "an accurate long term simulation of ( [ eq : shgw ] ) requires controlling the excitation of ( [ eq : shlgw ] ) by some global method .",
    "excellent long term accuracy has been obtained for the gauge wave test ( with periodic boundaries ) using a code  @xcite based upon a semi - discrete energy estimate derived at the linearized level by the _ summation by parts _ method  @xcite .",
    "comparable results for the gauge wave test can also be obtained using analogs of the semi - discrete monopole conservation laws applied in sec .",

    "solutions of ( [ eq : nlwave ] ) can be used to construct gauge waves via ( [ eq : shgw ] ) .",
    "the traveling waves ( [ eq : tphi ] ) and ( [ eq : tlphi ] ) are examples .",
    "thus the accurate long term simulation of solutions to ( [ eq : nlwave ] ) can be complicated by the existence of neighboring solutions which grow exponentially in time , in precise analogy with the gauge wave problem .",
    "we analyze the quasi - linear excision problem in terms of its elementary pieces . a stable algorithm for an initial - boundary value problem",
    "must also be stable for the corresponding linearized problem with frozen coefficients .",
    "this problem is considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : lin ] .",
    "we consider three separate regions : ( i ) behavior of the interior evolution , ( ii ) behavior at a time - like boundary and ( iii ) behavior at a spacelike boundary .",
    "treatment of a time - like boundary in general relativity introduces yet another computational difficulty related to the constraints . in the harmonic formulation of the initial - boundary value problem ,",
    "each component of the metric satisfies a quasi - linear wave equation whose principle part is identical to ( [ eq : wave ] ) .",
    "the only well - posed version of the initial boundary value problem which is known at present to preserve the harmonic constraints requires a dirichlet boundary condition for some metric components and a neumann boundary condition for the others  @xcite . for the purpose of future application of our results to harmonic evolution in numerical relativity",
    ", we concentrate here on such dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions , although the treatment extends to the general maximally dissipative boundary condition .",
    "the spatial discretization of the wave equation in second differential order form has many advantages over first order formulations , as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "these advantages have been recognized in recent second order harmonic approaches to numerical relativity  @xcite . for the case of zero shift ,",
    "a comprehensive treatment of the wave equation in second order form has been given for both dirichlet  @xcite and neumann boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "a major challenge of the excision problem is not just dealing with a shift but with a shift that is superluminal .",
    "this introduces complications even in the absence of boundaries .",
    "standard implicit  @xcite and explicit  @xcite evolution algorithms for the second order wave equation with shift are unstable in the superluminal case .",

    "[ sec : tbound ] , we give a finite difference algorithm for the subluminal case which is stable for both dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions .",
    "we give a detailed analysis , since there is little treatment of the second order wave equation with shift in the literature . whereas treatment of the dirichlet condition carries over unchanged , a non - zero shift forces a revision in the treatment of the neumann condition .",
    "the algorithm for the subluminal case ( the outer algorithm ) is well suited for treating the outer boundary of the excision problem but becomes unstable inside the horizon , where the shift is superluminal . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sbound ] , we give an alternative finite difference algorithm ( the horizon algorithm ) which is stable in this region and admits a stable spacelike excision boundary .",
    "we establish stability by using the method of lines to reduce the wave equation to ordinary differential equations in time on a spatial grid and then applying two standard techniques : mode analysis and semi - discrete energy estimates supplied by the summation by parts technique  @xcite .",
    "the energy method is important because it extends directly to the wave equation with non - constant coefficients in a region with inner and outer boundaries .",
    "we use the energy associated with the @xmath41-direction along which the spatial grid propagates .",
    "for the region inside the horizon , where this energy does not provide a positive - definite norm , we use mode analysis to establish a stable excision algorithm at the inner spacelike boundary .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : linexcis ] we treat the linearized excision problem .",
    "this involves blending together the outer and horizon algorithms obtained in sec .",
    "[ sec : lin ] .",
    "the additional ingredient is the necessity of non - constant coefficients in order to model a domain with spacelike inner boundary and timelike outer boundary .",
    "the homogeneous dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions are constructed so that the energy of the semi - discrete system is conserved when the coefficients of the wave operator are time independent .",
    "in addition , the algorithm is constructed so that it conserves a monopole moment associated with the scalar field in the case of time - dependent coefficients .",
    "the algorithm is implemented as a numerical code using a fourth order runge - kutta time integration .",
    "two code tests of the linear excision problem are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : ltests ] : one where the data describe a pulse completely inside the horizon ; the other where the data consist of an ingoing wave entering the outer boundary .",

    "although semi - discrete energy conservation is not considered in the nonlinear case , we construct the algorithm so that the scalar monopole moment remains conserved . studies of the gauge wave problem  @xcite show that either energy conservation or monopole conservation are sufficient to suppress the exponential mode ( [ eq : tlphi ] ) .",
    "this is confirmed in the numerical tests of the quasi - linear excision problem presented in sec .",

    "unfortunately , because the evolution algorithm ( [ eq : hlinwave ] ) involves a wider stencil than ( [ eq : olinwave ] ) it is difficult to analyze its behavior and design a clean algorithm near a timelike boundary .",
    "accordingly , we will use the _ outer algorithm _ ( [ eq : olinwave ] ) near a timelike boundary and the _ horizon algorithm _ ( [ eq : hlinwave ] ) in a region extending from the excision boundary to the exterior of the horizon .",

    "when @xmath311 is neglected and the metric coefficients in the wave operator are frozen , semi - discrete energy conservation also results for each metric component in the case of periodic boundary conditions . with a cubic grid boundary , the results for the quasi - linear wave equation generalize to dissipative dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions for the metric components .",
    "the chief complication is the application of neumann conditions at the edges and corners of the cube . here among possible approaches are the use of the _ summation by parts _ technique , as in  @xcite , or the introduction of a smooth boundary which is treated by interpolation , as in  @xcite .    the constraints on the boundary data present another complication .",
    "the constraints on the system ( [ eq : he ] ) , which guarantee that the solutions satisfy einstein s equations , are the harmonic coordinate conditions @xmath315 where @xmath316 are explicit harmonic driving functions .",
    "these constraints are satisfied by the solutions of ( [ eq : he ] ) if a certain mixture of dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions are used for the metric components  @xcite . in that case , the constraints are satisfied when homogeneous boundary data are given and the initial - boundary problem for einstein s equations is well - posed . in the case of inhomogeneous constraint - preserving boundary data it is not known whether the system remains well - posed .",
    "it should be emphasized that , in addition to the computational difficulty , there are analytic and geometric problems in treating black holes .",

    "there is the nonlocal nature of the _ true _ ( null ) event horizon .",
    "although the spacelike apparent horizon can be traced out as the evolution proceeds , it is impossible to locate the null event horizon until the exterior evolution is complete .",
    "the matching of an inner horizon algorithm to an outer algorithm must be carried out across an artificial horizon which results from a given choice of shift , as in our model problem . in the black hole excision problem",
