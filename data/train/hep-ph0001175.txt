    "+ the analysis of the chargino sector is independent of the structure of the neutralino sector which is potentially very complex in theories beyond the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "the structure of the chargino sector , by contrast , is isomorphic to the form of the mssm for a large class of supersymmetric theories .",
    "moreover , the analysis is based strictly on low  energy susy .",
    "once these basic parameters are determined experimentally , they provide essential components in the reconstruction of the fundamental supersymmetric theory at the grand unification scale .",

    "zero @xmath40 width can in general be neglected for the energies considered in the present analysis so that the charges are rendered complex in the born approximation only through the cp  noninvariant phase .",
    "+ for the sake of convenience we introduce eight quartic charges for each of the production processes of the diagonal and mixed chargino pairs , respectively .",
    "these charges @xcite correspond to independent helicity amplitudes which describe the chargino production processes for polarized electrons / positrons with negligible lepton masses .",

    "they can be formulated in terms of the squares of the bilinear charges , _",
    "i.e. _ the elements of the quartic charges .",
    "this follows from the observation that the mixing matrix is built up by trigonometric functions among which many relations are valid . from evaluating these sum rules experimentally ,",
    "it can be concluded whether @xmath86 forms a closed system , or whether additional states , at high mass scales , mix in .",
    "+ the following general sum rules can be derived for the two  state charginos system at tree level : @xmath87 the right  hand side is independent of any supersymmetric parameters , and it depends only on the electroweak parameters @xmath88 and on the energy , cf .",
    "eq.([eq : dflr ] ) .",
    "asymptotically , the initial energy dependence and the @xmath89 dependence drop out . the corresponding sum rule for the mixed left ",
    "right ( lr ) combination , @xmath90 involves the sneutrino mass and yukawa coupling . +",
    "the validity of these sum rules is reflected in both the quartic charges and the production cross sections .",
    "however , due to mass effects and the @xmath53-channel sneutrino exchange , it is not straightforward to derive the sum rules for the quartic charges and the production cross sections in practice .",
    "only _ asymptotically _ at high energies the sum rules ( [ eq : sum rule ] ) for the charges can be transformed directly into sum rules for the associated cross sections .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that all the physical observables are bilinear in @xmath91 and @xmath92 , enables us to relate the cross sections with the set of the six variables @xmath93 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we restrict ourselves to the left and right  handed cross section .",
    "we introduce the generic notation @xmath94 for the six cross sections @xmath95 and @xmath96 : @xmath97\\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] each cross section can be decomposed in terms of @xmath98 and @xmath99 as @xmath100 \\,z_j\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the matrix elements @xmath101 can easily be derived from table 1 together with eqs.([eq : dflr]-[eq:[12 ] ] ) .",
    "since the observables @xmath102 do not involve sneutrino contributions , the corresponding functions @xmath101 do not depend on the sneutrino mass .",
    "the 6@xmath1036 matrix @xmath101 relates the six left / right - handed cross section and the six variables @xmath104 .",
    "inverting the matrix gives the expressions for the variables @xmath104 in terms of the observables @xmath105 , which are not independent .",
    "we therefore obtain several non  trivial relations among the observables of the chargino sector : @xmath106 & & z_4=z^2_2 \\ , \\ \\ : \\ \\ f^{-1}_{4j } { \\sigma}_j            = \\left [ f^{-1}_{2j } { \\sigma}_j \\right]^2 \\\\[1 mm ] & & z_5=z^2_3\\ , \\ \\ : \\ \\ f^{-1}_{5j } { \\sigma}_j            = \\left [ f^{-1}_{3j } { \\sigma}_j\\right]^2 \\\\[1 mm ] & & z_6=z_2 z_3 : \\ \\ f^{-1}_{6j } { \\sigma}_j            = f^{-1}_{2j } f^{-1}_{3k } { \\sigma}_j{\\sigma}_k\\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where summing over repeated indices is understood .",
    "the failure of saturating any of these sum rules by the measured cross sections would signal that the chargino two ",
    "state @xmath107 , @xmath108 system is not complete and additional states mix in .",
    "we have analyzed in this report how the parameters of the chargino system , the chargino masses @xmath38 and the size of the wino and higgsino components in the chargino wave  functions , parameterized by the two mixing angles @xmath29 and @xmath30 , can be extracted from pair production of the chargino states in @xmath1 annihilation .",
    "three production cross sections @xmath109 ,",
    "@xmath110 , @xmath111 , for left and right  handedly polarized electrons give rise to six independent observables .",
    "the method is independent of the chargino decay properties , _",
    "i.e. _ the analysis is not affected by the structure of the neutralino sector which is very complex in supersymmetric theories while the chargino sector remains generally isomorphic to the minimal form of the mssm . + the measured chargino masses @xmath38 and the two mixing angles @xmath29 and @xmath30 allow us to extract the fundamental susy parameters @xmath112 in cp ",
    "invariant theories unambiguously ; in cp  noninvariant theories the modulus of @xmath5 and the cosine of the phase can be determined , leaving us with just a discrete two  fold ambiguity @xmath113 which can be resolved by measuring the sign of observables related to the normal @xmath0 polarizations .",
    "+ sum rules for the production cross sections can be used at high energies to check whether the two  state chargino system is a closed system or whether additional states mix in from high scales .",
    "+ _ to summarize _ , the measurement of the processes @xmath114 [ @xmath115 carried out with polarized beams , leads to a complete analysis of the basic susy parameters @xmath116 in the chargino sector .",
