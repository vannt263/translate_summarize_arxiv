    "the star gj  900 ( bd+00  5017 , hip  116384 ) is one of the nearest ( d=19.3@xmath10.6  pc ; perryman et al .",
    "1997 ) cool ( k7-m0 ) young stars known .",
    "it has been remarked because of its high level of h@xmath2 and caii h+k emission ( stauffer & hartmann 1986 ; bopp 1987 ; giampapa , cram & wild 1989 ) , as well as strong x - ray emission ( micela , favata & sciortino 1997 ; sterzik & schmitt 1997 ) , which indicate a young age .",
    "montes et al .",
    "( 2001 ) classify it as a member of the ic  2391 supercluster kinematic group .",
    "the ic  2391 cluster has a classical ( isochrone fitting ) age of 35  ma years ] , which has been recently revised to 53  ma using lithium observations of very low - mass ( vlm ) cluster members ( barrado y navascus , stauffer , & patten 1999 ) .",
    "on the other hand , eggen ( 1991 ) found that ic  2391 supercluster stars have a bimodal age distribution ( 80  ma and 250  ma ) .",
    "the far - infrared fluxes of gj  900 are normal for its spectral type ( mathioudakis & doyle 1993 ) , so there is no evidence for a large amount of warm dust in the system .",
    "bopp ( 1987 ) reported 15 radial velocity measurements for gj  900 obtained over a 3 year baseline .",
    "there was no sign for radial velocity variability larger than the error bars ( 1  @xmath3=1  km s@xmath4 ) .",
    "bopp also reported that gj  900 v - band photometry was constant within 0.01 magnitudes at v=9.54 .",
    "additionally , bessell ( 1990 ) found v=9.57 .",
    "hence , there is no evidence for large photometric variability despite of its high level of chromospheric and coronal activity .",
    "we included gj  900 in an ongoing high - resolution imaging survey for brown dwarf companions to nearby young cool stars .",
    "the star was thought to be single , but our observations have revealed the presence of two vlm companions .",
    "the projected separations are such that gj  900 could be a rare example of a young unstable trapezium triple system .",
    "monitoring of the orbital motion of this system is needed to determine the true separations of the components . in section  2",
    ", we present our observations and data analysis . in section  3 , we discuss the results and estimate masses for the components using theoretical models .",
    "gj  900 was observed in two observing runs ( 7 august 2002 and 18 january 2003 ) with the coronagraphic imager with adaptive optics ( ciao ) attached to the 8.2-meter subaru telescope ( see tamura et al .",
    "2000 for a description of the instrument ) .",
    "we used an ao imaging mode with a pixel scale of 0@xmath5.022 pix@xmath4 and a field of view of 22.3 square arseconds .",
    "we did not use the coronograph .",
    "it was inmediately apparent in the first inspection of the ao - corrected images at the telescope that there were two companions to gj  900 .",
    "in the first run , we took 6 images of 50  s , 6 images of 20  s , 18 images of 3.3  s in the h - band , and 6 images of 3.6  s in the k - band . in the second run , we took 12 images of 3  s in the h - band .",
    "the natural seeing in the second run was much worse than in the first one .",
    "data reduction was performed using standard iraf routines which included bias subtraction , cosmic ray correction , and flat fielding .",
    "differential magnitudes were calculated using the _ phot _ , _ psf _ and _ allstar _ routines in iraf s _ daophot _ package .",
    "the results are given in table  1 , together with relative astrometry of the triple system s components .",
    "error bars were estimated from the dispersion of the measurements obtained from individual images .",
    "the baseline of our two epochs is 163 days .",
    "the proper motion of gj  900 is 344 mas / yr , so the star should have moved 155 mas ( 7 pixels ) with respect to any background star .",
    "we would have detected such motion very easily in our images .",
    "thus , we confirm that the two companions share the same proper motion as the primary .",
    "moreover , there were not any other stars in the field of view of the ciao detector , and the two companions are redder in h - k than the primary ( table  1 )",
    ".    the near - infrared magnitudes of gj  900 ( combined flux of the whole system ) are j=6.865@xmath10.021 , h=6.245@xmath10.007 and k=6.008@xmath10.014 in the tcs system ( alonso , arribas & martnez - roger 1994 ) . using these photometric data and",
    "the differential photometry obtained from our ao observations , we derive h=6.52 for gj  900  a , h=8.30 for gj  900  b , and h=9.07 for gj  900  c. the distance modulus is m - m=1.46@xmath10.03 , and thus the absolute magnitudes are h=5.06 , 6.84 and 7.61 for gj  900  a , b and c , respectively . in order to estimate the masses of the components , we need to know the age of the system .",
    "montes et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have argued that it belongs to the ic  2391 supercluster on the basis of its space motion .",
    "ic  2391 cluster s classical age is @xmath635  ma .",
    "however , the age of ic  2391 has recently been revised to 53  ma using the lithium depletion boundary method ( barrado y navascus et al .",
    "1999 ) .    for an age of 35  ma ,",
    "we derive the following masses from the absolute h - band magnitudes and models tailored for gj  900 provided by i. baraffe ( they use the input physics described in baraffe et al .",
    "1998 ) : 0.60  m@xmath0 , 0.20  m@xmath0 and 0.09  m@xmath0 for gj  900  a , b and c , respectively . for an age of 50  ma , we infer masses of 0.61  m@xmath0 , 0.22  m@xmath0 and 0.14  m@xmath0 using the same models . as expected",
    ", the mass of the lowest mass component is the most sensitive to the age of the system .",
    "older ages , such as those proposed by eggen ( 1991 ) , lead to higher masses for the c component . in the referee report for this paper , john stauffer has argued that gj  900  a has an age of about 100  ma or older on the basis of its position in the @xmath7 versus @xmath8 color - magnitude diagram after correcting the flux for binarity and after comparing with low - mass members of the ic  2391 , ic  2602 and pleiades open clusters . the correction for the presence of the companions at visual wavelengths remains speculative until optical data is acquired for each of them .",
    "such a study is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "for an age of 100  ma , the masses of b and c would be 0.36  m@xmath0 and 0.21  m@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "determination of dynamical masses in the future will yield an improved age for the system using evolutionary models . in order to get a rough estimate of what to expect for the orbital period , we assume an age of 50  myr and a total mass of the system of 0.97  m@xmath0 . for a distance of 19.3  pc ,",
    "the projected separation between a and b is 10  au , and between a and c is 14.5  au .",
    "thus , we estimate orbital periods of @xmath634 years for gj  900  b and @xmath656 years for gj  900  c.    a hint of orbital motion may already be present in the difference between the position angles measured in the two different epochs of ciao observations ( table  1 ) .",
    "component b has moved 2.9 degrees in 0.45 years , while component b has not moved more than 0.2 degrees .",
    "if the orbits are circular , the orbital periods would be @xmath656 years for b , and @xmath9810 years for c , respectively .",
    "these periods are longer than our previous estimate , but we should bear in mind that most binary orbits are quite eccentric , and the components spend a larger fraction of the time near periastron .",
    "we will have to cover a significant fraction of the orbits to derive reliable orbital parameters .",
    "trapezium - like multiple systems have been defined as physical systems with a least 3 components where the largest separation is less than 3 times the smallest separation ( abt & corbally 2000 ) .",
    "the apparent configuration of the gj  900 system meets this criterion because the largest separation is 1.45 times the smallest one .",
    "the abastumi catalogue of trapezium - type multiple systems includes 637 objects .",
    "the masses of all these objects are several times that of the sun , and the ages are typically younger than 50  ma ( abt & corbally 2000 ; allen & poveda 1975 ; harrington 1992 ; salukvadze 1999 , 2000 ) because they are thought to be unstable .",
    "because of its present configuration , it appears that gj  900 could be the first example of a sub - solar mass trapezium - type multiple system .",
    "its survival would indicate an age younger than @xmath640  ma , or a peculiar orbital stability ( resonances ) .",
    "if gj  900 is significantly older than 40  ma , it is likely to be stable , and hence not a true trapezium system .",
    "there is about 10% chance that gj  900 looks like a trapezium - type system because of a chance projection ( ambartsumian 1954 ) .",
    "astrometric monitoring of the orbital motion is required to determine the inclination of the orbit with respect to the line of sight . in a few years",
    ", we should be able to tell whether gj  900 is a trapezium - like system or not , to estimate dynamical masses for the components , and to derive an age for the system .",

    "i also thank laird close , melanie freed , tim kendall and nick siegler for participating in the ciao observing runs , sharon velez erickson for assisting with data reduction , isabelle baraffe for providing models tailored for gj  900 , and john stauffer for a helpful referee report .",
