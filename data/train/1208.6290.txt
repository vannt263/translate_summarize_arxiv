    "in addition , current industrial demand for applications of guided waves is growing .",
    "often , new applications of guided waves involve complex structures .",
    "+ guided waves are more complicated than bulk waves because of their dispersive nature , infinite number of propagating modes , wave velocity and wave structure variations with mode and frequency , and waveguide boundary conditions @xcite . despite the complex nature of guided waves ,",
    "a complete understanding of guided wave propagation in a waveguide is necessary for robust theoretically driven inspection .",
    "for example , a prior knowledge of group velocity , wave structure , and skew angle of excited modes is required to estimate the location and type of a defect in a composite plate . on the other hand ,",
    "if the complexities of guided waves are quantitatively understood and utilized , the sensitivity and penetration power of guided waves can be significantly improved for inspection purposes .",
    "for instance , wave propagation characteristics of non - axisymmetric flexural modes in a pipe are used for synthetic and active focusing @xcite .",
    "another example of how theoritically understanding of guided waves can be applied to improve inspections is using wave structure matching for inspection of adhesive joints @xcite",

    "+ while dispersion curves , wave structure , mode selection , scattering properties , and wave propagation characteristics of guided waves should be studied for efficient and successful inspection , these concepts can be considered in a straight forward fashion for some simple geometries like single layer plates , multilayer plates , and pipes , where navier s equation can be solved by helmholtz decomposition or by the partial wave method @xcite .",
    "finite element analysis can be used when considering complex waveguides , but the method suffers from a fundamental inability to provide a generic solution for further sophisticated implementation of guided waves . in addition , computational cost and time consumption of finite element analysis is high , so it can not be used for geometrically large waveguides .",
    "semi - analytical finite element analysis ( safe ) can decrease the computation cost but is applicable for structures only with constant , albeit arbitrary cross section @xcite .",
    "+ on the other hand , understanding wave propagation properties in some important but complex curved geometries is highly desirable .",

    "analytical methods like helmholtz decomposition and the partial wave method can not provide solutions for geometrically complex curved structures ; and applicability of numerical solutions is also limited . therefore , developing a practical method to consider guided wave propagation in complex curved waveguides would be highly beneficial for extending the applications of guided waves for inspection purposes .",
    "+ in this work , a physical understanding of guided waves propagation is presented . a method for predicting guided wave propagation in complex waveguides",
    "is developed by considering the current understanding of different aspects of wave propagation .",
    "then , upon the new understanding given here , a quantitative method is developed .",

    "is proposed based on a newly developed perspective of guided wave propagation .",
    "finite element models are used to show that the method effectively excites the desired flexural modes .",
    "a summary of the method and potential applications are considered later in the text .",
    "a method is developed to study wave propagation in complex curved waveguides .",
    "there are a few approximation methods that can simplify the wave equation by low or high frequency approximations .",
    "they are based upon a taylor series expansion of the wave equation and then eliminating the higher orders based on some assumptions @xcite . in this work , a phenomenological approach is adopted instead of a mathematical approach .",
    "it is shown that the method is accurate and simple to apply in practical situations .",
    "the method is motivated by the following facts .",
    "1 .   a plane wave in an infinite medium is described by a specific direction of propagation and also a sinusoidal change in amplitude which is a function of time and distance along the wave propagation direction .",
    "one wavevector is chosen on behalf of an infinite number of wavevectors that exists all around the propagation region , because all of the wavevectors have the same direction and amplitude in the case of plane wave .",
    "consider the generalized case where the wave propagation direction is different at each point .",
    "then the plane wave symmetry is broken and the wave should be determined by a variable vector field that is a natural generalization of constant wavevectors .",
    "2 .   the plane wave in infinite medium moves on a straight line , because the medium is assumed to be isotropic and flat . consider a plane wave that moves in a two dimensional flat plate .",
    "the propagation path of the plane wave is considered as a straight line , but if the plate is curved the propagation path changes to a curved line .",
    "therefore , in order to extend a plane wave propagation in an isotropic medium to a multi - directional wave propagation on a two dimensional curved surface , the above facts lead us to the following perspective .    1 .",
    "an arbitrary wave is defined by a vector field that is changing point by point according to the underlying geometry and initial emission conditions .",
    "an infinite number of paths can be defined on the surface that are tangential to the propagation direction vector field at each point .",
    "these paths are called _ ray - paths_. in fact , ray - paths on a surface are geodesics of the surface .",
    "geodesics are defined as straight lines on a curved surface .",
    "the geodesics of a surface can be determined by the metric of the surface and the following relation @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is affine parameter , @xmath2 and @xmath3 s are the christoffel symbols of the metric .",
    "the intensity of the wave will change sinusoidally along each ray - path .",
    "we call the method a _ ray - method_. the method can be summarized as follows .",
    "assume that the excitation from a certain source on a complex curved surface is studied .",
    "infinite emitted rays are considered where the excitation conditions determines the initial position , initial direction , and maximum intensity of each ray .",
    "then , the geodesic equation determines the propagation path of each ray on the surface .",
    "the intensity of each ray changes sinusoidally along the ray - path . in order to find the intensity of the wave at each point",
    ", a superposition of all ray - path intensities that pass through the point at the same time is considered .",
    "+ in order to develop a complete method of studying guided wave propagation in a curved waveguide , though , the effect of thickness on guided waves should be addressed .",
    "until now , we have used rays to consider guided wave propagation .",
    "in particular , rays that lie on the surface of the waveguide . in this model , the thickness of the waveguide can not influence ray propagation .",
    "indeed , the ray - method can not capture guided waves properties caused be the thickness of the waveguide like dispersion curves and wave structures .",
    "now , the dispersion curves of a plate are compared with the dispersion curves of a pipe in order to get some insight on how the thickness can be included in the ray - method . +",
    "two phase velocity dispersion diagrams are defined for a plate : shear - horizontal dispersion curves ( shdcs ) and rayleigh - lamb dispersion curves ( rldcs ) .",
    "shdcs are derived from the following analytical relation @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the shear wave velocity , the frequency - thickness product , and the phase velocity of the nth mode , respectively .",
    "rldcs are derived numerically from the rayleigh - lamb transcendental equation @xcite .",
    "governing transcendental equations for deriving dispersion curves in a pipe are more complicated than for a plate @xcite .",
    "the complicated transcendental equations need to be solved in order to find torsional dispersion curves ( tdcs ) and longitudinal dispersion curves ( ldcs ) in a pipe .",
    "figure [ 1 ] shows the axisymmetric part of tdcs and ldcs in a steel pipe ( red ) with @xmath8 and shdcs and rldcs in a steel plate ( blue ) on the same graph .",
    "considering the dispersion curves in figure @xmath9[1 ] reveals that the axisymmetric part of pipe dispersion curves nearly are the same as plate dispersion curves for higher frequencies .",
    "the primary differences are in the low frequency limit where @xmath10 and @xmath11 experience a jump to higher phase velocities .",
    "this jump for the pipe with @xmath8 occurs around @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "the frequency where this jump occurs tends toward zero as the @xmath1 factor decreases . in most practical pipes the @xmath1 parameter is less than @xmath13 , so we can approximate the axisymmetric part of pipe dispersion curves by plate dispersion curves . +     ( red ) and the dispersion curves in a steel plate ( blue ) .",
    "the diagram shows that the axisymmetric dispersion curves in the pipe are nearly the same as the dispersion curves in the plate for higher frequencies.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    an axisymmetric mode in the context of the ray - method is represented by rays that move along the pipe axial direction .",
    "thus , the similarity between the axisymmetric part of the pipe dispersion curves and the plate dispersion curves means that we should get plate type dispersion in a pipe , if we consider a set of rays moving along the pipe axial direction .",
    "this observation leads to the notion that instead of using a single ray confined to the surface of a waveguide we could consider a curved plate spanning the thickness of the waveguide where the plate falls along a ray - path and is normal to both free boundaries of the waveguide . in this context",
    ", the axisymmetric dispersion curves of a pipe will be same as the dispersion curves of a plate .",
    "hereafter , this concept will be referred to as _ ray - plate _ method .",
    "+ in the following section , guided wave propagation in a pipe is studied by the ray - plate method .",
    "new analytical relations are derived for pipe dispersion curves using the ray - plate method .",
    "results from the ray - plate method are compared with exact results derived by the global matrix method .",
    "it is shown that the ray - plate method predicts accurate results for the pipe dispersion curves .",
    "in addition , it provides new insight on pipe flexural modes .",
    "in this section , the ray - plate method is applied to hollow circular cylinders . guided waves in hollow circular cylinders",
    "have been studied extensively @xcite . the global matrix method with numerical calculation are often used in a complicated form to derive the pipe dispersion curves @xcite .",
    "there are no analytical solutions for the torsional and the longitudinal dispersion curves of pipe .",
    "the ray - plate method is presented in detail and its results are compared with existing solutions for guided waves in hollow circular cylinders . + as mentioned before , comparing dispersion curves between plates and pipes show that shdcs in plates are approximately the same as the axisymmetric tdcs in pipes and also that the rldcs in plates approximate axisymmetric ldcs in pipes .",
    "also , the axisymmetric modes in the context of the ray - method corresponds to an infinite set of rays that move parallel to the pipe axial direction .",
    "this leads to the extension of the ray - method from membranes to thick - walled shells , if instead of a set of rays , a set of plates across the thickness of the surface is considered .",
    "each plate propagates along a ray - path and is perpendicular to both boundary surfaces of the shell .",
    "each plate carries lamb waves and/or sh waves .",
    "these plates are called _ ray - plates_. + the ray - plate method claims that axisymmetric modes are ray - plates that move parallel to the axial direction of pipe .",
    "ray - plates that move at a relative angle with the axial direction can naturally become a candidate for explaining flexural modes .",
    "let s construct dispersion curves in pipe by the ray - plate method base on the above insight about axisymmetric and flexural modes .",
    "+ as mentioned above a flexural mode is constructed by a set of ray - plates carrying lamb waves or sh waves and moving in a direction that makes an angle @xmath14 with the pipe s axial direction ( z - direction ) .",
    "consequently , the phase velocity of the flexural modes and corresponding axisymmetric modes are the same at a fixed angular frequency @xmath15 .",
    "the only difference is that these modes are moving in a different direction than axisymmetric modes , namely by the angle @xmath14 .",
    "dispersion curves in a pipe are defined by choosing the z - axis as a preferred direction .",
    "the phase velocity of each mode is determined by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the @xmath18-component of the wavevector .",
    "therefore , the phase velocity of a flexural mode can be derived by the following relation : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the phase velocity of the axisymmetric mode at each frequency @xmath15 and @xmath14 is the angle of wave propagation .",
    "the cylindrical shape of a pipe imposes a periodic displacement continuity boundary condition in the circumferential direction .",
    "a flexural mode is defined as a lamb or sh wave existing in a ray - plate , where the ray - plate makes angle @xmath14 with the z - axis .",
    "so , the displacement field components can be written as @xmath21 in a pipe , if @xmath22 is changed to @xmath23 , the displacement vector should be the same , meaning that @xmath24 .",

    "is used to derive ldcs in a pipe . mean radius and thickness of pipe , plate phase velocities at each frequency , and flexural orders",
    "should be substituted in eq . in order to drive the ldcs .",
    "figure 2 shows a comparison between the ldc derived by the ray - plate method and the global matrix method .",
    "it is observed that at lower frequencies , flexural modes are separated more from each other than at higher frequencies .",
    "figures [ fig : ldcsubfig1 ] and [ fig : ldcsubfig2 ] show that the derived ldcs in a 3.5[in ] schedule 40 pipe by the ray - plate method are in good agreement with dispersion curves derived by the global matrix method .",
    "[ figure : ldc1 ]    the following analytical relation for tdcs , including flexural modes , can be derived by using equation and the shear horizontal dispersion relation : @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath28 are shear wave velocity , frequency - thickness product , family order , and flexural order , respectively . figure [ fig : tdc ] shows a comparison between dispersion curves of a 3[in ] schedule 40 steel pipe derived by the ray - plate method and the global matrix method .",
    "the figure shows that the analytical relation , derived by the ray - plate method , provides an accurate approximation for tdcs in pipes .",
    "+ it is simple to check that if the limit @xmath41 is considered , we get the shear horizontal dispersion curve relation .",
    "in addition , considering limit @xmath42 gives @xmath43 .",

    "flexural modes are related to rays whose propagation direction make an angle @xmath14 with the z - axis . while the group velocities for all rays are the same , the propagation paths for the flexural modes will be longer than those of the axisymmetric modes .",
    "therefore , the measured group velocities for flexural modes along the z - axis are less than those of their corresponding axisymmetric modes .",
    "higher order flexural modes correspond to longer paths and hence lower group velocities .",
    "limitations of the ray - plate method for the prediction of guided wave propagation in complex curved surfaces are now considered .",
    "it is shown that the ray - plate method presents a relatively accurate approximation when the thickness to curvature radius ratio of a structure is less than @xmath46 at each point of the structure . otherwise , some deviations from the exact solutions will be observed . in many practical situations , however , the ratio of thickness to curvature radius is less than @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , wave propagation in many practical curved surfaces can be considered by the ray - plate method . + considering the derivation of pipe dispersion curves by the ray - plate method in the previous section showed that in the context of ray - plate method dispersion curves in a pipe can be derived from the dispersion curves of a plate .",

    "the curvature radius for the curved ray - plates in a pipe decreases for higher order flexural modes .",
    "the curvature radius for the axisymmetric ray - plate is infinite and for the flexural mode @xmath47 is the radius of the cylinder . + for the sake of simplicity , the ray - plate method was based on flat ray - plates .",

    "@xcite under the topic of guided circumferential waves in a circular annulus .",
    "they showed that the dispersion curves in a curved plate experience some deviations from flat plate dispersion curves ; and that the deviations are higher for a smaller curvature radius . + a cylindrically curved surface ( cylinder )",
    "is assumed to be long enough as to neglet edge effects .",
    "guided waves are assumed to propagate in the circumferential direction .",
    "navier s equation is solved in cylindrical coordinates .",

    "these figures reveal that for value @xmath48 , the dispersion curves can be approximated by the plate dispersion curves .",
    "the @xmath1 value for most of standard pipe sizes is less than @xmath46 .",

    "the method reveals that flexural modes are basically like axisymmetric modes which propagate at an angle relative to the axial direction in a pipe .",

    "first , one pure flexural mode can not be excited by these methods , several other flexural modes and also axisymmetric modes are excited at the same time .",
