    "in large part , we are aware of the principal processes that create free electrons in otherwise completely neutral parts of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the disk of our galaxy . however , for some of the contributing factors , ones that either enhance or diminish the relative ionization of the gas , there is a need to validate our understanding of their strengths .",
    "most of these processes are well understood qualitatively , but one major quantitative uncertainty is the effectiveness of extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) and soft x - ray photons in ionizing the gas .",
    "two factors contribute to this uncertainty : one is the difficulty in measuring the fluxes of diffuse photons with energies above the ionization potential of hydrogen ( 13.6  ev ) but below about 100  ev , and the other is an overall assessment of how well these photons can penetrate the neutral regions , which depends on the porosity of the gas structures and the distribution of radiation sources .",
    "our ultimate goal is not only to understand these processes better , but also to obtain an estimate for the fractional amount of the gas that is in an ionized state .",
    "this information is relevant to gauging the strength of heating of the gas due to the photoelectric effect from dust grains irradiated by starlight , since the grain charge , which regulates its rate , depends on the electron density ( weingartner & draine 2001b ) . while generally considered to be less important than the photoelectric effect , other means of creating thermal energy , such as the heating caused by secondary electrons from cosmic ray and x - ray ionizations and the dissipation of alfvn waves and magnetosonic turbulence ( kulsrud & pearce 1969 ; mcivor 1977 ; spangler 1991 ; minter & spangler 1997 ; lerche et al .",
    "2007 ) , depend on the relative fractions of electrons .",
    "cooling of the gas through the collisional excitation of the fine - structure levels of c@xmath3 , si@xmath3 and fe@xmath3 or , at temperatures approaching @xmath4k various metastable levels and the l@xmath5 transition of hydrogen , are likewise governed by the degree of partial ionization ( dalgarno & mccray 1972 ) . in the following paragraphs",
    ", we consider three different pathways for creating small amounts of ionization in the mostly neutral ism .    except for the interiors of dense clouds where there is significant extinction ,",
    "all of the space in the disk of our galaxy is exposed to ultraviolet starlight photons that are capable of ionizing atoms that have first ionization potentials less than that of hydrogen ( 13.6  ev ) .",
    "since the recombination rates of the ions are slow relative to their ionization rates , the concentrations of the ionized states of these atoms are strongly dominant .",
    "thus , it is a simple matter to add together the contributions from various elements that are able to supply free electrons .",
    "the only uncertainty here is an accounting of the strengths of depletions from the gas phase caused by these elements condensing into solid form onto dust grains .",
    "these strengths vary collectively for all of the elements from one region to the next .",
    "if we take such variations into account ( jenkins 2009 ) , we can state that most of the gas will have free electron contributions that should be somewhere in the range @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number density of heavy elements that are capable of being ionized_1 $ ] and @xmath8_0 $ ] listed in jenkins ( 2009 ) for elements that can be ionized by starlight , except that the gas - phase abundance of c was lowered by a factor of 0.43 , in accord with the recommendation by sofia et al .",
    "( 2011 ) that earlier determinations of @xmath9 were systematically too high by a factor of 1/0.43 . ] and @xmath10 is the total density of hydrogen in both neutral and ionized forms .    as cosmic ray particles collide with gas atoms in the galaxy , they heat and ionize the ism .",
    "we are unable to observe the flux of the lowest energy particles because we are shielded from them by the heliospheric magnetic field , and extrapolations from the observed higher energy flux distributions are uncertain ( spitzer & tomasko 1968 ) .",
    "nevertheless , from measurements of the relative abundances of trace molecular species , the cosmic ray ionization rates @xmath11 seems to be the most plausible range for the general ism ( wagenblast & williams 1996 ; liszt 2003 ; indriolo et al . 2007 ; neufeld et al .",
    "2010 ; indriolo & mccall 2012 ) , although details in the chemical models may introduce some uncertainty [ cf .",
    "le petit et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and shaw et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ] .",
    "the chemical models of bayet et al .",
    "( 2011 ) suggest that in some particularly active regions the ionization rates may increase to @xmath12 .",
    "we now consider a third mechanism for ionizing the gas , one that is harder to quantify than the other two .",
    "euv and soft x - ray radiation can ionize atoms , through both the action of primary photoionizations and by creating a cascade of energetic , secondary photoelectrons that can collisionally ionize other atoms .",
    "estimates of the effectiveness of these agents are difficult to synthesize , since there are many complicating factors . at high energies ,",
    "much of the radiation arises from cooling , very hot ( @xmath13k ) gas coming from recently shocked regions within the disk and halo of our galaxy . for energies slightly above about 100  ev",
    ", the photons can survive a journey through the neutral medium up to about @xmath14 , and this penetration depth progressively increases with energy . supplementing this ionizing radiation is that coming from several kinds of sources that are embedded within the neutral medium .",
    "these include stars over a wide range of spectral types on the main sequence , active x - ray binaries , and the plentiful , but faint white dwarf ( wd ) stars .",
    "the objective of the current study is to use specialized observations to help resolve the uncertainties that were mentioned above and gain a quantitative insight on how effectively the neutral regions are partially photoionized by euv and x - ray radiation .",
    "we do this by repeating a method developed by sofia & jenkins ( 1998 , hereafter sj98 ) , who examined interstellar uv absorption features that could be seen in the spectra of background stars so that they could compare the abundance of the neutral form of argon , which is highly susceptible to being photoionized , to that of hydrogen , which has an ionization potential very close to that of argon but with a markedly lower ionization cross section .",
    "we propose that it is safe to assume that the abundance of argon ( both neutral and ionized ) relative to that of hydrogen should be equal to the solar ratio .",
    "for instance , sj98 presented arguments that support the principle that argon in the gas phase is not likely to be depleted by being incorporated into an atomic matrix within interstellar dust grains .",
    "we will reinforce this idea with some indirect observational evidence in section  [ reference_abund ] .",
    "thus , we operate on the principle that any deficiency of neutral argon ( ar  i ) below our expectation for the amount of h  i that is present may be considered to arise from the conversion of ar to its ionized form , which is invisible .    the investigation by sj98 covered an extremely limited number of target stars observed with the _ interstellar medium absorption profile spectrograph _ ( _ imaps _ ) ( jenkins et al .",
    "later , jenkins et al .",
    "( 2000b ) and lehner et al .",
    "( 2003 ) reported on observations of absorption features of ar  i observed by the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "( _ fuse _ ) ( moos et al . 2000 ; sahnow et al . 2000 ) toward collections of wd stars inside and slightly beyond the edge of the local bubble , in order to infer ionization conditions of clouds subjected to the characteristic radiation field in our immediate neighborhood .",
    "our current goal is to extend our reach well beyond the stars surveyed in these two studies , again by using",
    "spectra , so that we can sample regions of more typical densities well outside the local bubble .",
    "we do this by downloading from the mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) at the space telescope science institute a large collection of _ fuse _ spectra of hot subdwarf stars that are situated several hundred pc away from us , well beyond the boundary of the local bubble .",
    "our ultimate objective is to compare the neutral fractions of ar and h , as had been done in past investigations .",
    "however , a conventional approach of simply deriving the two column densities and dividing one by the other is not easily achievable with the data in this survey for two reasons .",
    "first , it is difficult to measure @xmath15(ar  i ) because the lines are saturated , but only moderately so , and recorded at low resolution .",
    "second , the amount of h  i on a sight line can usually be determined from the damping wings of l@xmath5 , but when the interstellar column density is low and there is a significant stellar l@xmath5 absorption , one must know the star s effective temperature and surface gravity and then create a model for the stellar feature , against which the interstellar feature is superimposed . also , as emphasized by sofia et al .",
    "( 2011 ) measurements of @xmath15(h  i ) using the damping wings of l@xmath5 can give a misleading outcome if one does not know about and correct for the effects of the velocity structures of the gas .",
    "this problem is probably most severe for low column density cases in the present study .",
    "we can overcome the difficulties mentioned above if we replace h with o as the comparison element .",
    "in the wavelength coverage of _ fuse _ there are a large number of o  i absorption features , and these lines cover a broad range of transition probabilities .",
    "most important , the strengths of the o  i features are comparable to the one available feature of ar  i.  because the 1066.660@xmath16  line has interference from a pair of strong stellar si  iv lines at nearly the same wavelength . ] by a simple comparison of the strength of this ar  i line to those of o  i , we can determine @xmath17 .",
    "we describe this process in more detail in section  [ derivation ] .",
    "the ionization fraction of o is strongly locked to that of h through a strong charge exchange reactionk ) for the lowest fine - structure level in the o  i ground state .",
    "however , since the ionization fractions are small and most of the gas we are considering is at temperatures much higher than @xmath18 , this deviation is generally small enough to ignore .",
    "nevertheless , we performed explicit calculations of the o and h ionization fractions , as described later in section  [ charge_exchange ] . ]",
    "( field & steigman 1971 ; chambaud et al .",
    "1980 ; stancil et al .",
    "thus we can use o as a proxy for h. the only shortcoming of this tactic is that o can be depleted in the ism , but the depletion factors are not very large in the regimes of low densities considered here ( cartledge et al . 2004 , 2008 ; jenkins 2009 ) .",
    "section  [ obs ] of this paper describes the selection of archival _ fuse _ spectra and how they were processed to yield useful presentations of the absorption features for measurements of equivalent widths .",
    "our method of interpreting the spectra to yield the ionization of ar relative to that of o is presented in section  [ analysis ] .",
    "section  [ beyond ] contains a short digression on how we verify that the target stars are beyond the edge of the local bubble . in section  [ fundamentals ] we outline the basic equations that take into account the processes that influence the partial ionizations of ar , relative to those of h and o. the equations presented in this section are virtually identical to those outlined by sj98 , but with some new refinements ( i.e. , a few reactions that were not included earlier ) .",
    "we consider the creation of free electrons from the starlight ionization of heavy elements and the effects from cosmic rays as processes that are mostly understood and already accounted for , and view the actions arising from euv and x - ray ionizations as the principal unknowns whose strengths are to be determined . in section  [ known_photoionization ]",
    "we make a prediction for the degree of ionization produced by known sources of radiation , but find that in order to satisfy the general outcomes for our measured ratios of ar  i to o  i , an extraordinarily low volume density of hydrogen @xmath10 is required . in order to obtain the same results for higher densities",
    ", we must propose a means of achieving higher levels of ionization . in section  [ additional_photoionization ]",
    "we propose two possibilities : ( 1 ) there is a large residual ionization left over from effects of radiation emitted by nearby , but now extinct supernova remnants ( snrs ) over the past several myr or ( 2 ) the neutral medium is porous enough to allow external , low - energy photons to penetrate the gas with less than the expected amount of attenuation .",
    "section  [ discussion ] presents an overview of the implications of our results on an assortment of physical processes and various other kinds of observations that depend on electron fractions in the diffuse , neutral medium .",
    "the paper ends with a summary of the main conclusions ( section  [ summary ] ) .",
    "appendices to this paper give descriptions of various atomic processes that were incorporated into the calculations , but at a level of detail that most readers may wish to ignore . a general section on the ionizations arising from secondary electrons ( appendix  [ gamma_s ] )",
    "is broken into two subsections : one treats the effects from electrons liberated by the ionizations of h and he ( section  [ electrons_h_he ] ) , while the second one discusses primary and auger electrons created by the inner shell x - ray ionizations of heavy elements ( section  [ heavy_elem ] ) .",
    "appendix  [ gamma_he ] gives the equations for evaluating the effects from a multitude of different kinds of ionizing photons that arise from the recombination of he@xmath19 and he@xmath3 ions with free electrons .",
    "finally , appendix  [ cr_ioniz ] describes how we can estimate the rates of cosmic ray ionization of h@xmath20 , he@xmath20 and ar@xmath20 from the observed rates that apply to molecular hydrogen in dense clouds .",
    "our objective was to make use of target stars that represented intermediate cases between nearby wd stars , whose sight lines are entirely or heavily influenced by conditions in the local bubble , and the much more distant hot main - sequence , giant or supergiant stars that can create their own enhanced ionizations in atypical concentrations of gas associated with their formation .",
    "hot subdwarf stars represent a class of objects that fall into this intermediate category .",
    "they have distances that are of order a few hundred parsecs from us , which reduces the contribution from material in the local bubble to a very minor level . since they are old , they have had adequate time to escape from their progenitorial gas clouds , and thus their locations are essentially random and should show no preference for dense gas complexes .",
    "they have the additional advantage that they are bright enough to yield good quality spectra , but they are not so bright that they exceed the maximum allowed count - rate levels for _ fuse_.    in an initial screening of prospective targets , we examined the quick - look plots of all stars classified as sdo and sdb spectral types in the mast archive of _ fuse _ data . in this step , we rejected all spectra that either seemed to show very strong stellar spectral features ( 8 stars ) or that had an inadequate signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath21 ) at wavelengths in the vicinity of 920@xmath16  ( 70 stars ) , which is where most of the o  i lines are situated .",
    "a few further rejections were made after the spectra were downloaded and found to have observing anomalies ( an extraordinarily large number of missing observations caused by channel misalignments : 3 stars ) , strong stellar features that were not evident in the quick - look plots ( 3 stars ) , or molecular hydrogen lines that were strong enough to seriously compromise the lines that we wanted to measure ( 2 stars ) .",
    "the lack of stars with exceptionally strong h@xmath22 features helped to eliminate sight lines that penetrate dense , cool gas clouds .",
    "all of the downloads of the calibrated _ fuse _ data from mast occurred well after the final pipeline reductions were performed for the archive with calfuse version 3.2.3 ( dixon et al .",
    "2007 ) . for every target , we accepted data from all of the available observing sessions ( identified by unique archive root names ) but rejected any subexposures that had an extraordinarily low count level caused by a channel misalignment during the observation .",
    "we used exposures obtained during both orbital day and night .",
    "normally , one must be cautious about observations of features for either o  i or n  i because they can be filled in by diffuse telluric emission lines during daytime observing .",
    "however the o  i transition strengths considered here are so weak that the telluric contributions are insignificant .",
    "all subexposures and spectral channels that passed our initial screening were coadded with weight factors based on the inverse squares of their respective values of @xmath21 for intensities smoothed over a wavelength interval of 0.12@xmath16  ( or 9 independent spectral elements  this ensures that weights are not strongly influenced by random noise excursions ) . before this coaddition took place , we examined some strong interstellar features and aligned the individual spectra in wavelength against a preliminary coaddition with no wavelength shifts .",
    "this process enabled us to virtually eliminate any degradation in resolution caused by drifts of the spectra in the wavelength direction from one subexposure to the next .",
    "however , there can still be overall small systematic errors in radial velocity of about @xmath23 ; see appendix  a of bowen et al . ( 2008 ) . in a few cases ,",
    "the spectral @xmath21 values were too low to allow such shifts to be made with much confidence , even after the intensities were smoothed with a median filter for viewing .",
    "such spectra were combined without any shifts . for every target ,",
    "two combined spectra were created : one was made up with shifts appropriate to the spectral region covering the ar  i line at 1048@xmath16 , while the other had differentials that were optimized for the wavelengths that covered the weakest o  i lines near 920@xmath16 .",
    "we measured equivalent widths of the ar  i and o  i lines by integrating intensity deficits below best - fitting legendre polynomials for the continua defined from intensities at locations somewhat removed from the features .",
    "special precautions were made to account for various sources of error , which are important for later analysis stages that assign relative weights to different measurements and also for the estimates of the ultimate errors in the results .",
    "first , we accounted for the direct effect that random count - rate variations can have on the equivalent width outcome ( jenkins et al .",
    "next , the weakest lines are subject to uncertainties arising from improper definitions of the continua . to construct the probable errors , we evaluated the expected formal errors in the polynomial coefficients , as described by sembach & savage ( 1992 ) , and then we multiplied them by 2 in order to make an approximate allowance for additional uncertainties caused by the arbitrariness in selecting the most appropriate polynomial order . to find the effects of these continuum errors on our measurements ,",
    "the equivalent widths were re - evaluated using the probable excursions of the continua on either side of the preferred ones .",

    "these two cases illustrate strong differences in the degree of interference from stellar lines .",
    "the first example , agk+81  266 , has many stellar lines that can either add an apparent absorption to an interstellar line or distort the continuum level that is measured on either side of the line .",
    "for this target , these effects dominate over other sources of error and create @xmath454 uncertainties in @xmath455 equal to 18.5 and 14.2@xmath16m  for the ar  i and o  i lines , respectively .",

    "we adopt a mean value for the recommended outcomes of the two , @xmath456 .",
    "( since both determinations might be subject to common errors , the error of the mean is not reduced below the 0.10@xmath16dex errors specified by each of them . ) this value is higher than the solar photospheric value proposed by asplund et al .",

    "( 2009 ) and again apply a @xmath457dex settling correction to get @xmath459 .",
    "this value agrees remarkably well with the measurement @xmath460 obtained for b - stars by przybilla et al .",

    "we must now consider the prospect that some of the ar and o atoms are incorporated into solid form within or on the surfaces of dust grains , and this effect might be large enough to distort our findings on the differences in ionization .",
    "unfortunately , we have no direct information about the depletion of gas - phase ar , since ionization corrections ( the object of the present study ) can influence the outcome . while in principle",
    "it would be beneficial if we could study @xmath461 along sight lines that penetrate dense media , where depletions are likely to dominate over ionization effects , this is not possible because the absorption lines are far too saturated ( much more so than in the current study ) .",
    "sj98 presented a number of theoretical arguments that suggested ar is not appreciably depleted in the low density ism that we can observe .",
    "however , it would be good to confirm this outlook by some independent , experimental means .",
    "fortunately , krypton is an element that can be observed in the ism , and , like argon , is chemically inert",
    ". it would be reasonable to expect that the capture of kr onto interstellar dust grains , if it happens , would be similar to that of ar .",
    "an advantage of studying kr is that its interstellar features are weak ( cartledge et al . 2008 ) , which means that they can be used to measure column densities over sight lines that have high values of @xmath462 where element depletions should be generally very strong . as with ar",
    ", kr has a photoionization cross section that is substantially larger than that of h ( sterling 2011 ) .",
    "thus , any simple measure of the deficiencies of this element in the low density ism could simply be a product of it being more easily photoionized than h.    a way to overcome the confusion from the offset produced by ionization is to compare differential capture rates of elements onto grains as the conditions that favor grain formation change .",
    "for instance , jenkins ( 2009 ) has determined that for sight lines with @xmath463 , where ionization corrections should be small , when @xmath464 o atoms are removed from the gas phase , @xmath465 atom of kr vanishes .",
    "since o is more abundant than kr by a factor of @xmath466 , any relative decrease in the abundance of kr in the gas phase would be about half that of o ( but the errors allow for this factor to range from zero to being equal to that of oxygen ) .",
    "if we accept the idea that ar depletes in the same manner as kr , probably to within a factor of @xmath467 , and that in low density media o shows very low depletions ( @xmath468dex ) ( jenkins 2009 ) , it is reasonable to adopt a gas - phase abundance ratio that is virtually the same as the protosolar ones , @xmath469 . if indeed there is some mild depletion of o due to the formation of silicate dust grains , we may understate the strength of the ionization of ar .",
    "we adopt the premise that the distribution of radial velocities of the neutral argon atoms is identical to that of neutral oxygen ( but this is not exactly correct ; we will revisit this issue later ) .",
    "figure  [ oi_fits ] shows examples of some standard curve - of - growth plots for the o  i lines appearing in the spectra of the same two targets that were featured in fig .",
    "[ sample_spectra ] , agk+81  266 and uv0904@xmath10902 .",
    "the former of the two illustrates an average amount of line saturation for relevant features , while the latter represents an extreme case of saturation caused by a low overall dispersion of radial velocities . in principle , we could have derived values for @xmath15(o  i ) from the best - fit curves of growth shown by the dashed curves in the figure panels and then assume that @xmath15(ar  i ) follows from the equivalent width of the one available line at 1048.220@xmath16  assuming the same velocity dispersion parameter @xmath470 as that found for o  i. instead , we used a much simpler approach that sidesteps the goal of deriving explicit values of @xmath15 and @xmath470 ( whose errors are strongly correlated ) and proceeds directly to an answer for just the ratio of the two column densities .",
    "an advantage here is that we can make a straightforward analytical determination of the uncertainty of the outcome based on the errors of some linear fitting coefficients .",
    "the comparison of ar  i to o  i is based on the following principle . if one could imagine the existence of a hypothetical o  i line with a transition strength @xmath471 that is just right to produce a value of @xmath472 that exactly matches that of the ar  i line , one could then derive the deficiency of ar  i with respect to its expectation based on o  i , which we denote in logarithmic form as [ ar  i / o  i ] .",
    "this quantity yields the logarithm of the ratio of the two neutral fractions relative to the solar abundance ratio and is given by the relation @xmath473&=&\\log ( f\\lambda)_{\\rm o~i}-\\log ( f\\lambda)_{\\rm ar~i}-\\log   ( { \\rm ar / o})_\\odot\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\log ( f\\lambda)_{\\rm o~i}-0.28\\pm 0.11,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath474 ( morton 2003 ) .    to determine the strength of the hypothetical o  i line , we perform a weighted least - squares linear fit for @xmath475 vs. the quantity on the right - hand side of eq .  [ ar_o_eqn ] ( the abscissa for each plot in fig .  [ oi_fits ] ) for an appropriate selection of o  i lines .",

    "we define a simple relationship in @xmath475 that is a good approximation to a relevant portion of the curve of growth .    in the two panels of fig .",

    "a conventional approach for deriving the error of the quotient is to add in quadrature the relative errors of the two terms , yielding the relative error of the quotient .",
    "however , this scheme breaks down when the error in the denominator is not very much less than the denominator itself .",
    "a more robust way to derive the error of a quotient has been developed by geary ( 1930 ) ; for a concise description of this method see appendix  a of jenkins ( 2009 ) .",
    "we use this method here ; it is effective as long as there is little chance that the denominator minus its error could become very close to zero or be negative , i.e. , @xmath488 .",
    "the dotted lines in figure  [ oi_fits ] show schematically how the best fit values and the error ranges for [ ar  i / o  i ] are derived .",
    "note that the horizontal and vertical segments for the error limits do not exactly intersect the best linear trend for the o  i lines because the error analysis allows for the uncertainty for the location of this line .",
    "( but we point out that the intersections for the worst possible error in one direction for @xmath484 do not occur at the locations for the worst possible deviations in the opposite direction for the trend line . ) also , the final errors for @xmath489=x_{\\rm ar~i}$ ] are not symmetrical about the best values . on average ,",
    "the upward error bounds are about 75% as large as the negative ones .",
    "the difference in atomic weights of ar and o will cause the thermal contributions to the doppler broadenings of these two elements to differ from each other .",
    "the impact of this effect on our results for the column density ratios is small however .",
    "for instance , if we consider that we are viewing absorption lines arising from the warm , neutral medium ( wnm ) and there were no bulk motions of the gas , the line broadening parameters @xmath490 caused by thermal doppler broadening for @xmath491k would be 2.7 and @xmath492 for o  i and ar  i , respectively . for a typical observation , such as the one for agk+81  266 illustrated in the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ oi_fits ] , we find that the observed curve of growth for the o  i lines , yielding an apparent @xmath493 , indicates that kinematic effects arising from turbulent motions ( or multiple velocity components ) should be the most important contribution to the broadening since @xmath494 is only slightly smaller than @xmath495 .",
    "the curve of growth that characterizes the saturation of the ar  i line would conform to a slightly lower velocity dispersion parameter compared to that observed for o  i , @xmath496 , because the higher atomic weight of ar causes the thermal contribution to be smaller . for the observed equivalent width of the ar  i line , the error in the ratio of column densities caused by our assumption that the values of @xmath497 of the two elements are identical will create an underestimate of @xmath498=-0.012\\,$]dex .",
    "a similar calculation for the more extreme line saturation exhibited by uv0904@xmath10902 shown in the right - hand panel of fig .  [ oi_fits ] indicates that the perceived outcome for [ ar  i / o  i ] could be too low by @xmath499dex .",
    "cases showing this much saturation are rare for our collection of sight lines .    if the kinematic line broadening is not an approximately gaussian form that one would expect from pure turbulent broadening , but instead results from distinct and well - separated narrow components , the errors in [ ar  i / o  i ] could be larger than those evaluated above",
    ". however , the recordings of ar  i lines for 9 different stars made by _ imaps _ at a resolution of @xmath500 that were shown by sj98 reveal profiles that , while not exactly gaussian , are nevertheless generally smooth and devoid of any narrow spikes that are isolated from each other .",
    "thus , the numerical estimates presented in the above paragraph should be reasonably accurate .",
    "one might question whether or not errors in the adopted @xmath476-values could cause global systematic errors in the evaluations of [ ar  i / o  i ] .",
    "while morton ( 2003 ) listed a very small uncertainty for the @xmath476-value of the ar  i line at 1048.220@xmath16 , he did not specify errors for the o  i lines . nevertheless , empirical evidence from high quality _ fuse _ observations of wd stars by hbrard et al .",

    "various secondary ionizing processes initiated by the primary photoionizations of h and he likewise have a stronger effect on ar than on h. this contrast in ionization rates is the fundamental tool that we use in the interpretation of the ar data to quantify the photoionization of h and the subsequent creation of free electrons . for the collective effect of all of these ionization channels",

    "next , we include secondary ionizations with rates @xmath518 that are created by the collisions from energetic electrons that are liberated by the primary photoionizations of h and he . added to this",
    "are the effects from photons with energies above about 300@xmath16ev , which can interact with the abundant heavy elements in the ism to produce additional energetic electrons that will ionize h and ar with a rate that we identify as @xmath519 .",
    "these electrons arise from the primary ionizations of the inner electronic shells , and they are supplemented by one or more additional electrons from the auger process .",
    "finally , we must acknowledge that recombinations of singly- and doubly - ionized he ions with electrons create additional photons when de - excitation occurs in the lower stage of ionization , either he@xmath20 or he@xmath3 .",
    "the importance of not overlooking secondary electrons and recombination photons from the he ionizations is underscored by the fact that while the abundance of he is only 1/10 that of hydrogen , its primary ionization cross section is 6 to 100 times that of h over the energy range 25 to 4000@xmath16ev .",
    "most of the recombination photons are capable of ionizing both h and ar , and they supplement the other sources of ionization with rates @xmath520 and @xmath521 . in short , we consider that the total ionization rates for the two elements in eq .  [ p_ar ]",

    "secondary ionizations outweigh the primary ones for photon energies above about 100  ev . by contrast , we find that for ar the enhancement at these energies is small compared to its much higher primary cross section .",
    "a more narrowly defined version of @xmath523 , which we denote as @xmath527 , applies to an irradiation of the gas by photons of a given energy @xmath516 , rather than from a combination of fluxes over a broad energy range .",

    "using this strategy , we compare the column densities of ar  i and o  i derived from absorption lines seen in the _ fuse _ spectra of 44 hot subdwarf stars .    since the neutral forms of argon and oxygen are virtually absent in regions that are fully ionized ( either the prominent h  ii regions around hot stars or the much lower density but more pervasive wim ) , our probes sample only regions that have appreciable concentrations of h  i. this sets our measurements apart from conventional determinations of average electron densities ( e.g. , pulsar dispersion measures , h@xmath5 intensities , c  ii fine - structure excitation , etc . ) , which are strongly influenced by contributions from the fully ionized regions .",

    "our second explanation is a time - dependent solution that can sidestep the problem of overheating in the equilibrium case discussed above . over a period of one to a few times @xmath819yr",
