    "the solution of the schrdinger equation with a time dependent potential leading to transitions between bound and free states of a quantum system is clearly of great theoretical and practical interest .",
    "fermi s golden rule ( based on a deep physical interpretation of first order perturbation theory ) gives the decay exponent of the survival probability for a system in a bound state subjected to a weak external oscillating potential , with frequency @xmath8 , @xmath9 the energy of the bound state @xcite .",
    "the approaches used to go beyond the golden rule include higher order perturbation theory , semi - classical phase - space analysis , floquet theory , complex dilation , exact results for small fields , and numerical integration of the time dependent schr \" odinger equation @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these works have yielded both theoretical understanding and good agreement with dissociation experiments in strong laser fields .",
    "in particular they have been very successful in elucidating much of the rich structure found in the experiments on the multiphoton ionization of rydberg atoms by microwave fields @xcite@xcite .",
    "explicit results for realistic systems require , of course , the use of some approximations whose reliability is not easy to establish a priori .    it would clearly be desirable to have examples for which one could compute the time evolution of an initially bound state and thus the ionization probability for all values of the frequency and strength of the oscillating potential to as high accuracy as desired without any _ uncontrolled _ approximations .",
    "this is the motivation for the present work which describes new exact results relating to ionization of a very simple model atom by an oscillating field ( potential ) of arbitrary strength and frequency .",
    "while our results hold for arbitrary strength perturbations , the predictions are particularly explicit and sharp in the case where the strength of the oscillating field is small relative to the binding potential  a situation commonly encountered in practice .",
    "going beyond perturbation theory we rigorously prove the existence of a well defined exponential decay regime which is followed , for late times when the survival probability is already very low , by a power law decay .",
    "this is true no matter how small the frequency .",
    "the times required for ionization are however very dependent on the perturbing frequency . for a harmonic perturbation with frequency @xmath1",
    "the logarithm of the ionization time grows like @xmath10 , where @xmath0 is the normalized strength of the perturbation and @xmath5 is the number of `` photons '' required for ionization .",
    "this is consistent with conclusions drawn from perturbation theory and other methods ( the approach in @xcite being the closest to ours ) , but is , as far as we know , the first exact result in this direction .",
    "we also obtain , via controlled schemes , such as continued fractions and convergent series expansions , results for strong perturbing potentials .",
    "quite surprisingly our results reproduce many features of the experimental curves for the multiphoton ionization of excited hydrogen atoms by a microwave field @xcite .",
    "these features include both the general dependence of the ionization probabilities on field strength as well as the increase in the life time of the bound state when @xmath11 , @xmath5 integer , is very close to the binding energy .",
    "such `` resonance stabilization '' is a striking feature of the rydberg level ionization curves [ 3 ] .",
    "these successes and comparisons with analytical results @xcite-@xcite suggest that the simple model we shall now describe contains many of the essential ingredients of the ionization process in real systems .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian in our model is ,    @xmath12    @xmath13 has a single bound state @xmath14 with energy @xmath15 and a continuous uniform spectrum on the positive real line , with generalized eigenfunctions @xmath16    and energies @xmath17 .",
    "beginning at some initial time , say @xmath18 , we apply a parametric perturbing potential @xmath19 , i.e.   we change the parameter @xmath20 in @xmath13 to @xmath21 and solve the time dependent schrdinger equation for @xmath22 ,    @xmath23    with initial values @xmath24 .",
    "this gives the survival probability @xmath25 , as well as the fraction of ejected electrons @xmath26 with ( quasi- ) momentum in the interval @xmath27 .",
    "this problem can be reduced to the solution of an integral equation @xcite . setting    @xmath28",
    "@xmath29 satisfies the integral equation    @xmath30y(t ' ) dt'\\right \\}\\ ] ]    where we have set @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    "our first exact result is the following :    _ when @xmath33 is a trigonometric polynomial , _    @xmath34,\\ ] ]    the survival probability @xmath25 tends to zero as @xmath35 , for all @xmath36    .",
    "that is there will be full ionization for arbitrary strength and frequency of the oscillating field .",
    "since the main features of the argument are already present in the simplest case @xmath37 we now specialize to this case .",
    "the asymptotics of @xmath29 are obtained from its laplace transform @xmath38 , which satisfies the functional equation ( cf .",
    "( [ eq:(5 ) ] ) )    @xmath39    with the boundary condition @xmath40 as @xmath41 ( the relevant branch of the square root is @xmath42 for @xmath43 ) .",
    "we show that the solution of ( [ eq:(8 ) ] ) with the given boundary conditions is unique and analytic for @xmath44 , and its only singularities on the imaginary axis are square - root branch points .",
    "this in turn implies that @xmath45 does indeed decay in an integrable way .",
    "the ideas of the proof carry through directly to the more general periodic potential ( [ eq:(7 ) ] ) and we have obtained analogous results for a two delta functions reference potential @xcite .    full ionization is in fact expected ( for entropic reasons ) to hold generically , but has , as far as we know , only been proven before for small amplitude of the oscillating potential with @xmath46 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , or for sufficiently random perturbations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the detailed behavior of the system as a function of @xmath47 , @xmath1 , and @xmath0 is obtained from a precise study of the singularities of @xmath48 in the whole complex @xmath49-plane .",
    "here we discuss them * for small @xmath0 * ; below , the symbol @xmath50 describes error bounds of order @xmath51 . at @xmath52",
    ", @xmath53 has square root branch points and @xmath53 is analytic in the right half plane and also in an open neighborhood @xmath54 of the imaginary axis with cuts through the branch points . as @xmath55 in @xmath54",
    "we have @xmath56 , for some constants @xmath57 , then for small @xmath58 the function @xmath53 has a unique pole @xmath59 in each of the strips @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 is strictly independent of @xmath62 and gives the exponential decay of @xmath63 .",
    "the analytic structure of @xmath53 is indicated in figure 1 where the dotted lines represent ( the square root ) branch cuts and the dark circles are simple poles .",
    "the function @xmath64 is the inverse laplace transform of @xmath53    @xmath65    where the contour of integration @xmath66 can be initially taken to be the imaginary axis @xmath67 , since @xmath53 is continuous there and decays like @xmath68 for large @xmath49 .",
    "we then show that @xmath69 can be pushed through the poles , collecting the appropriate residues , and along the branch cuts as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the residue at the pole @xmath59 is proportional to @xmath70 while the ( rapidly convergent ) integral along the @xmath71th branch cut is ( as seen by standard laplace integral techniques ) , a function whose large @xmath47 behavior is @xmath72 ( the @xmath73 power comes from the fact that @xmath53 has square root branch points ; @xmath74 is some constant ) .    a detailed analysis along these lines yields ( @xcite , @xcite ) ,    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is periodic of period @xmath77 and @xmath78 for large @xmath47 in more than a half plane centered on the positive real half - line .",
    "_ not too close to resonances _ , i.e.  when @xmath79 , for all integer @xmath5 , @xmath80 and its fourier coefficients decay faster than @xmath81 .",
    "also , the sum in ( [ eq : intform ] ) does not exceed @xmath82 for large @xmath47 , and the @xmath83 decrease with @xmath62 faster than @xmath84 .    by ( [ eq : intform ] ) , for times of order @xmath85 where @xmath86 , the survival probability for @xmath1 not close to a resonance decays as @xmath87 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 2 where it is seen that for @xmath88 the exponential decay holds up to times at which the survival probability is extremely small .",
    "note also the slow decay for @xmath89 , when ionization requires the absorption of two photons .",
    "for even larger @xmath0 one can note in the figure oscillatory behavior .",
    "this is expected from equation ( [ eq : intform ] ) .",
    "when @xmath0 is larger ( inset in fig .",
    "2 ) the ripples of @xmath90 are visible and the polynomial - oscillatory behavior starts sooner . since the amplitude of the late asymptotic terms is @xmath91 for small @xmath0 , increased @xmath0 can yield a higher late time survival probability .",
    "this phenomenon , sometimes referred to as `` adiabatic stabilization '' @xcite , @xcite , can be associated with the perturbation - induced probability of back - transitions to the well .    using continued fractions @xmath92",
    "can be calculated convergently for any @xmath1 and @xmath0 . for small @xmath0",
    "we have    @xmath93    eq .",
    "( [ devilstaircase ] ) agrees with results of perturbation theory .",
    "thus , for @xmath43 , @xmath92 is given by fermi s golden rule @xcite since the transition matrix element between the bound state with energy @xmath94 and the continuum state with energy @xmath95 is    @xmath96    while the density of states is @xmath97 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath92 is different at the resonances @xmath98 .",
    "for instance , whereas if @xmath1 is not close to @xmath99 , the scaling of @xmath92 implied by ( [ devilstaircase ] ) is @xmath100 when @xmath46 and @xmath101 when @xmath102 , when @xmath103 we find    @xmath104    in figure 3 we plot the behavior of @xmath3 , as a function of @xmath1 , for a small value of @xmath0 . the curve is made up of smooth ( roughly self - similar ) pieces for @xmath1 in the intervals @xmath105 corresponding to ionization by @xmath5 photons .    at resonances ( for small @xmath0 these occur for @xmath106 close to an integer )",
    ", the coefficient of @xmath107 , the leading term in @xmath92 , goes to zero .",
    "this yields an enhanced stability of the bound state against ionization by perturbations with such frequencies .",
    "the origin of this behavior is , in our @xmath108 model , the vanishing of the matrix element in ( [ e10 ] ) at @xmath109 .",
    "this behavior should hold quite generally in @xmath110 where there is a factor @xmath111 in @xmath92 coming from the energy density of states near @xmath109 .",
    "as @xmath0 increases these resonances shift in the direction of increased frequency . for small @xmath0 and @xmath112 the shift in the position of the resonance , sometimes called the dynamic stark effect [ 1 ] , is about @xmath113 .    in figure 4",
    "we plot the strength of the perturbation @xmath0 , required to make @xmath114 for a time of about 700 oscillations of the perturbing field , i.e.  time is measured in units of @xmath106 , as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "also included in this figure are experimental results taken from table 1 in @xcite , see also figures 13 and 18 there for the ionization of a hydrogen atom by a microwave field for approximately the same number of oscillations . in these still ongoing beautiful series of experiments , @xcite@xcite ,",
    "the atom is initially in an excited state with principal quantum number @xmath115 ranging from 32 to 90 .",
    "the `` natural frequency '' @xmath116 is there taken to be that of an average transition from @xmath115 to @xmath117 , so @xmath118 .",
    "the strength of the microwave field @xmath119 is then normalized to the strength of the nuclear field in the initial state , which scales like @xmath120 .",
    "the plot there is thus of @xmath121 vs. @xmath122 . to compare the results of our model with the experimental ones we had to relate @xmath0 to @xmath123 , and given the difference between the hydrogen atom perturbed by a polarized electric field @xmath124 , and our model , this is clearly not something that can be done in a unique way .",
    "we therefore simply tried to find a correspondence between @xmath125 and @xmath0 which would give the best visual fit .",
    "somewhat to our surprise these fits for different values of @xmath126 all turned out to have values of @xmath0 close to @xmath127 .",
    "a correspondence of the same order of magnitude is obtained by comparing the perturbation - induced shifts of bound state energies in our model and in hydrogen .",
    "we note that the maximal values of @xmath0 in figure  4 are still within the regime where only a few terms in ( [ eq : intform ] ) are sufficient .    in figure  5 we plot @xmath25 vs. @xmath0 for a fixed @xmath47 and two different values of @xmath1 .",
    "these frequencies are chosen to correspond to the values of @xmath126 in the experimental curves , figure 1 in @xcite and figure 1b in @xcite .",
    "the agreement is very good for @xmath128 and reasonable for the larger ratio .",
    "our model essentially predicts that when the fields are not too strong , the experimental survival curves for a fixed @xmath129 ( away from the resonances ) should behave essentially like @xmath130^{\\scriptstyle\\frac{\\scriptstyle 2}{\\scriptstyle n_0^{3}\\omega}}\\,\\omega\\,t\\right)$ ] with @xmath131 depending on @xmath132 but , to first approximation , independent of @xmath123 .",
    "given the simplicity of our model , the similarity ( using a minimal numbers of adjustable parameters ) with the experiments on hydrogen atoms was surprising to us .",
    "as already noted these experimental results and in particular the resonances can be understood quite well , including some details , by doing calculations on the full hydrogen atom or a one dimensional version of it @xcite-@xcite .",
    "still , it is interesting to see that similar structures arise also in very simple models .",
    "it suggests that various features of the ionization process have a certain universal character . to really pin down the reason for this universality will require much further work .",
    "we note that for @xmath133 , in the limit of small amplitudes @xmath0 , a predominantly exponential decay of the survival probability followed by a power - law decay was proved in @xcite for three dimensional models with quite general local binding potentials having one bound state , perturbed by @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is a local potential .",
    "our results for general @xmath1 and @xmath0 can be thought of as coming from a rigorous borel summation of the formal ( exponential ) asymptotic expansion of @xmath64 for @xmath35 .",
    "these methods can be extended to other systems @xcite including , we hope , realistic ones .    .",
