    "the interplay between the electron s spin degree of freedom and the inter - electron interaction has been of interest in the condensed matter physics , in particular in the jellium model where the neutralizing background is taken to be rigid and uniform .",
    "the relative strength of the interaction is conventionally measured through the parameter @xmath3 which is the interparticle distance measured in units of the bohr radius @xmath4 , @xmath5 being the dielectric constant and @xmath6 the band mass of electron . for electrons confined to two dimensions , which will be our focus in this paper , we have @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the two - dimensional density of electrons .",
    "the interaction strength is enhanced relative to the kinetic energy as the system becomes more dilute , i.e. , as @xmath3 increases .",
    "it has been predicted that as @xmath3 is increased , the electron liquid eventually becomes spontaneously spin polarized to gain in the exchange energy , ultimately going into a wigner crystal at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional electron systems , obtained experimentally at the interface of two semiconductors , constitute an almost ideal realization of the jellium model for several reasons .",
    "samples with mobility in access of 10 million @xmath10/vs are available @xcite , minizing the effect of disorder .",
    "furthermore , the density of electrons , which controls the strength of the interaction relative to the kinetic energy , can be varied by a factor of 20 @xcite .",
    "we will consider electrons in the presence of a magnetic field , specifically , at filling factor @xmath0 , which is a particularly clean test case for the kind of physics in which we are interested .",
    "there are three relevant energy scales here : @xmath11 is the cyclotron energy , @xmath12 is the typical coulomb energy , @xmath13 being the magnetic length , and @xmath14 is the zeeman splitting energy which is the zeeman energy cost necessary for a single spin flip .",
    "( to an extent , the zeeman and the cyclotron energies can be varied independently by application of the magnetic field at an angle ; while the former depends on the total magnetic field , the latter is determined by the normal component only . )",
    "the ground state is known in two limits .",
    "when @xmath15 dominates , the ground state is a spin singlet , with 0@xmath16 and 0@xmath17 landau levels fully occupied . on the other hand , when @xmath14 is the largest energy , the ground state is fully polarized ; when the coulomb interaction is not strong enough to cause substantial landau level mixing ( i.e. , in the limit of @xmath18 ) , the ground state has 0@xmath16 and 1@xmath16 landau levels occupied .",
    "when the ground state is described in terms of filled landau levels , we will denote it by @xmath19@xmath20@xmath21 , where @xmath22@xmath16 and @xmath22@xmath17 are the numbers of occupied landau levels for up and down spin electrons .",
    "the possible filled landau level states at @xmath0 are then @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the unpolarized and the fully polarized states , respectively .",
    "our interest will be in situations when @xmath25 becomes comparable to or greater than the cyclotron energy .",
    "this again corresponds to @xmath26 , where at @xmath0 , @xmath3 can be seen to be given by @xmath27 and is clearly a measure of the strength of the interaction relative to the cyclotron energy .",
    "here , landau level mixing becomes crucial and may destabilize the above states",
    ". our principal goal will be to determine the phase diagram of the fully polarized and the unpolarized states @xmath24 and @xmath23 .    our work has been motivated by the recent experiments of eriksson _ et al . _",
    "@xcite where they investigate by inelastic light scattering both the spin and the charge density collective modes at @xmath0 for samples with @xmath3 as large as 6 ,",
    "corresponding to densities as low as @xmath28 @xmath29 .",
    "they find a qualitative change in the number and the character of collective modes at approximately @xmath30 .",
    "this was interpreted in a landau fermi liquid approach , where the magnetic field was treated as a perturbation on the zero field fermi liquid .",
    "however , the fermi liquid approach , which is suitable at small magnetic field , is not an obviously valid starting point for the problem at hand , and other approaches are desirable . a comparison between the ground state energies of the unpolarized and the fully polarized hartree fock state shows that a transition between them takes place at @xmath31 for @xmath32 , as we will see in .",
    "this raises the question : is the ground state at large @xmath3 fully polarized ?",
    "if true , this would indeed be an interesting example of an interaction driven ferromagnetism .",
    "if it is indeed fully polarized , is the @xmath24 state a reasonable starting point for its study ?",
    "besides being fully polarized , @xmath24 incorporates the effect of landau level mixing , albeit in a very special manner , through promoting all electrons in 0@xmath17 to 1@xmath16 .    a reliable treatment of landau level mixing lies at the crux of the problem .",
    "we shall incorporate landau level mixing in a perturbative time - dependent hartree - fock scheme , i.e. , by incorporating vertex corrections through ladder diagrams in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "the most crucial approximation in our calculations will be a restriction to the subspace of a single - particle hole pair ; within this subspace , however , the landau level mixing is treated accurately .",
    "clearly , this approach is not quantitatively valid except at small @xmath3 , but we believe that it gives an insight into the physics even when @xmath3 is not small . for a better quantitative description at large @xmath3 , it would be important to deal with screening by more than one particle - hole pair , but that is outside the scope of the present paper .",
    "as mentioned above , there certainly are parameters for which the fully polarized @xmath24 state describes the actual ground state ; in particular , it may occur even when @xmath3 is large provided that the zeeman energy is sufficiently strong .",
    "our approach here will be to take it as the starting point and investigate the regime of its stability by calculating the dispersion of the charge and the spin density collective modes .",
    "the collective modes have a simple interpretation when the landau level mixing is negligible ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the lowest charge density excitation mode corresponds to the excitation of one electron from 1@xmath16 to 2@xmath16 landau level .",
    "the kinetic energy change of any collective mode is well defined when the landau level mixing is weak , and will be used to label the various modes ( this notation will be used even when the landau level mixing is significant , by looking at the evolution of the modes from small to large @xmath3 ) .",
    "the 1@xmath16@xmath342@xmath16 mode will be referred to as the @xmath35 mode . for spin - density excitation",
    ", there are three modes of primary interest , corresponding to excitations 0@xmath16@xmath340@xmath17 , 1@xmath16@xmath341@xmath17 , and 1@xmath16@xmath340@xmath17 which are depicted schematically in ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) in fig.[sdediagram ] respectively .",
    "the first two are @xmath36 modes and the last one is @xmath37 mode .",
    "these are of course coupled , and a diagonalization of the problem produces the usual spin - wave excitation mode , with the energy approaching the zeeman splitting in the long wave length limit , in accordance with the goldstone theorem , as well as two massive spin - density modes .",
    "our principal result is that while the charge density collective mode shows no instability , the spin - density collective mode develops a deep roton minimum in the presence of substantial landau level mixing and becomes soft in certain parameter regimes .",
    "( indeed , as @xmath3 is increased , there will eventually also be an instability in the charge density channel , indicating the formation of a wigner crystal , but we have not explored this question since our perturbation theory is not valid at very large @xmath3 . ) both the existence of the roton minimum and its softening as the zeeman energy is reduced are experimentally testable predictions of our theory .",
    "the phase diagram thus obtained later is shown in fig.[phase ] .",
    "it is instructive to compare it with the phase diagram in the absence of interactions , which consists of the fully polarized state @xmath24 for @xmath38 and the unpolarized state @xmath23 for @xmath39 with a transition taking place at precisely @xmath40 . at small @xmath3",
    ", interactions make the @xmath24 state more stable , indicated by the fact that it survives even for @xmath41 .",
    "however , at large @xmath3 , @xmath38 is required to stabilize the fully polarized state .",
    "it is noteworthy that at small @xmath14 , the fully polarized state is found to be unstable at arbitrary @xmath3 .",
    "we also consider the collective modes of @xmath23 , expected to be valid at small @xmath14 and @xmath3 .",
    "it becomes unstable as @xmath3 is increased , consistent with an earlier conclusion of macdonald @xcite .",
    "what about the state at large @xmath3 but small zeeman energy ?",
    "as discovered in our study , here the @xmath0 state is not described by either of the two aforementioned hartree fock states .",
    "the finite wave vector spin - wave instability of the fully polarized state suggests that it is some kind of spin density wave state .",
    "it is not possible to be more definitive about it based on our present study .",
    "of course , at extremely large @xmath3 , when @xmath25 is much larger than the cyclotron energy , our calculation is unreliable , but indicates that even if a fully polarized state occurs , as expected based on the zero field result , it will most likely not be described by the @xmath24 hartree fock state .",
    "there have been many theoretical studies of the collective excitations of integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) states in the past , but , to our knowledge , the spin - density wave excitations of the fully polarized @xmath24 state have not been considered previously . for other collective modes ,",
    "our results reduce to the earlier results in appropriate limits . if possible transitions of the electron and hole between different landau levels are ignored and if self - energy corrections are omitted , the problem of collective excitation is reduced to determining the binding energy of two oppositely charged particles strictly confined in their respective landau levels@xcite . in this case",
    "the wave function for the bound state is independent of interaction potential , and is uniquely determined by the wave vector @xmath42 .",
    "the transition of the electron and hole or the recombination of the particle - hole pair has been considered in the random phase approximation(rpa)@xcite . later the rpa was incorporated with the self - energy correction and the binding energy term by kallin and halperin @xcite where a number of interesting collective excitations from the unpolarized and the partially polarized ground state were considered in the absence of landau level mixing ( valid when @xmath43 ) .",
    "the landau level mixing was considered by macdonald in , treating the mixing matrix elements between various modes as small parameters and applying a second order perturbation theory .",
    "our calculation will be formulated in terms of diagrams , following kallin and halperin in , and will be performed with a full treatment of the mixing matrix elements within the subspace of a single particle - hole pair at any given instant .",
    "the diagrammatic formulation of the problem is presented in detail in sec.[sec - diagram ] below .    in sec.[sec - fullypol ] we describe the diagrammatic formalism used to compute dispersion curves of the collective excitation from the fully polarized ground state at @xmath0 .",
    "we will concentrate on the spin density excitation which will be responsible for an instability of the iqhe state in the parameter regime under consideration .",
    "similarly , is devoted to the collective excitations of the unpolarized ground state at @xmath0 .",
    "dispersion curves of the spin density excitation is computed for various values of @xmath3 and zeeman splitting energy , @xmath14 . the phase diagram as a function of @xmath3 and @xmath14",
    "is obtained in by determining the critical @xmath14 at which the energy of the spin density excitation vanishes . from the phase diagram we will learn that for large @xmath3 and small @xmath14 neither the fully polarized nor the unpolarized state is stable against a spin - density wave state . the paper is concluded in , where we also discuss the implications of our study for the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) .",
    "even though the choice of gauge does not affect physical quantities , we find it convenient to use the symmetric gauge",
    ". we will start by establishing the basic algebra in the symmetric gauge closely following .",
    "the hamiltonian for an electron moving in a two dimensional space under a perpendicular magnetic field is given by    @xmath44    where the kinetic momentum is written down as    @xmath45    when the magnetic field is uniform , we can use a convenient algebraic method analogous to the solution by the ladder operator of the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator . in order to construct the algebraic formalism",

    "the eigenstates , however , can not be fully determined by the landau level index alone because the energy does not depend on the coordinates of the cyclotron orbit center , indicating a degeneracy of the landau level .",

    "the sensitivity of eigenvalues to rounding errors during the execution of some algorithms can be reduced by the procedure of _ balancing_. the idea of balancing is to use similarity transformations to make corresponding rows and columns of a matrix have comparable norms , thus reducing the overall norm of the matrix while leaving the eigenvalues unchanged .",

    "finally , we mention that even though the above formalism has been developed for a general situation , we will concentrate on the physics at @xmath0 in the following sections taking the coulomb potential as the interaction .",

    "equipped with the explicit formulas for the binding energy , the rpa energy and the self energy , we compute the dispersion curves of the collective excitation from the fully polarized ground state .",

    "the off - diagonal terms due to the interaction energy become negligible compared to the kinetic energy .",

    "\\(i ) the nature of instability is different depending on whether @xmath3 is small or large . at small @xmath3 , where the interactions are negligible and",

    "\\(ii ) at small @xmath3 , the interactions make the fully polarized ( 2:0 ) state more stable as compared to the non - interacting problem , as evidenced by the fact that the transition out of it takes place at a zeeman energy",
    "_ smaller _ than @xmath275 .",
    "this is precisely as expected from the exchange physics , as also captured by the hartree - fock phase diagram .",
    "\\(iii ) the instability in the spin - wave mode occurs through the development of a roton minimum , the energy of which vanishes at certain zeeman energy .",
    "the roton minimum in turn is caused by the landau level mixing , underscoring the important role of landau level mixing at large @xmath3 . without landau level mixing the spin - wave mode",
    "does not show any instability as shown in .",
    "\\(iv ) for the unpolarized state , the lowest spin density excitation is the @xmath35 mode at all @xmath3 , the long wavelength limit of the excitation energy of which is fixed to be @xmath276 independent of @xmath3 . here also , the instability occurs through a roton , which becomes deeper as the @xmath3 is increased ( and interactions become stronger ) . since a spin flip is favored by exchange , the energy of the @xmath35 mode decreases with increasing @xmath3 , consistent with the feature that the critical @xmath14 in this case is monotonically decreasing as a function of @xmath3 , as is shown in .",
    "\\(v ) at small @xmath3 there is a small region in where the two phases coexist .",
    "this clearly is an artifact of various approximations involved in our calculation , and implies that the actual locations of the phase boundaries can not be taken too seriously . as mentioned earlier , a first order transition is likely to occur _ before _ the roton energy vanishes .",
    "\\(vi ) at large @xmath3 and small @xmath14 , the ground state is derived neither from ( 2:0 ) nor from ( 1:1 ) . since we find a _ finite _ wave vector instability in the spin density wave excitation , it is natural to expect that the state here has a spin - density wave state .",
    "further work will be required to establish the nature of this state in more detail .",
    "the principal outcome of our calculations is the phase diagram in which shows the regions where the fully polarized and the unpolarized hatree fock states ( 2:0 ) and ( 1:1 ) are valid .",
    "we believe that it should be possible to investigate the roton minimum in the spin - wave excitation of the fully polarized state as well as its instability in inelastic light scattering experiments .",
    "another situation where similar physics may apply is in the case of composite fermions @xcite at effective filling factor @xmath277 , which corresponds to the electron filling factor @xmath278 . it is easier in this case to see a transition between the fully polarized and the unpolarized states because the effective cyclotron energy for composite fermions is substantially small compared to the cyclotron energy of electrons , which makes it possible to obtain @xmath14 comparable to or larger than the effective cyclotron energy in tilted field experiments .",
    "the critical zeeman energy at the transition was calculated by park and jain by comparing the ground state energies @xcite , in reasonable agreement with the experiments of kukushkin , von klitzing , and eberl @xcite .",
    "park and jain also estimated a mass for composite fermions , the  polarization mass \" by equating the critical zeeman energy to the effective cyclotron energy .",
    "there is one subtlety though . in the case of composite fermions both the effective cyclotron energy and",
    "the effective interactions derive from the same underlying energy , namely the coulomb interaction between the electrons , and therefore neither the interactions between composite fermions nor a mixing between _ composite fermion _",
    "landau levels can , in principle , be neglected in any realistic limit .",
    "these would provide a correction to the mass obtained in .",
    "however , we note that the mass was reliable to no more than 20 - 30% , and the corrections may be negligible compared to that .    interestingly , there is experimental evidence @xcite that the transition between the fully polarized and the unpolarized composite fermion states does not occur directly but through an intermediate state with a partial spin polarization .",
    "murthy @xcite has proposed that this state is a hofstadter lattice of composite fermions , and has half the maximum possible polarization .",
    "it would be interesting to see if similar physics obtains for @xmath0 as well .",
    "in particular , the phase diagram of predicts that for @xmath279 , the transition from the fully polarized state to the unpolarized state as a function of the zeeman energy is not direct but through another , not yet fully identified state .",
    "( we suspect that this may be true at any arbitrary @xmath3 , although not captured by our calculated phase diagram . )"
