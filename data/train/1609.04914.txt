    "in recent years there has been a surge in experimental studies of dipole excitations lying on the low - energy tail of the isovector giant dipole resonance , the so - called pygmy dipole resonance ( pdr ) .",
    "the pdr has been interpreted as an exotic mode of excitation due to the motion of a weakly bound neutron excess against an almost inert proton - neutron core @xcite , although single particle - hole excitations are also considered @xcite .",
    "one major reason for the renewed interest in the pdr is the possibility of carrying out high - resolution measurements on these low - lying dipole excitations using heavy ion @xcite , proton @xcite , and @xmath1 inelastic scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "an experimental technique , combining particle and @xmath3-ray detection techniques , to study the response of dipole excitations to isoscalar probes was pioneered by poelhekken _",
    "_ @xcite and applied in several studies since @xcite .",
    "these experiments provide complementary information to those obtained from ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) experiments which investigate the isovector nature of the excitations @xcite .",
    "one of the surprising results from recent experiments is the isospin splitting of the pdr @xcite .",
    "this provides intimate knowledge about the isospin nature of these excitations which would not be possible to infer from ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) experiments alone .",
    "these experimental discoveries were followed by intensive theoretical investigations @xcite .    incidentally , scattering experiments with isocalar probes for the study of the pdr have so far been limited to only certain regions of the nuclear chart and carried out mainly on nuclei with large neutron - to - proton ratios @xcite .",
    "information on how the results from scattering reactions compare to those of ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) experiments in nuclei closer to @xmath61 are also becoming available @xcite .",
    "since most of the incident isoscalar probes are sensitive to the surface of the nucleus , the information gathered advances our understanding of the evolution of the pdr with changing @xmath7 .",
    "this information is extrapolated for obtaining better estimates of the total strength exhausted by the pdr in nuclei of astrophysical importance , many of which are still inaccessible with the available experimental facilities and techniques .",
    "the pdr has been suggested to have a significant impact on neutron capture rates and isotopic solar abundance distributions in r - process nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "further , the pdr could possibly constrain the equation - of - state of hot and dense neutron matter as found in neutron star remnants @xcite .    in this contribution , we present results on @xmath0ge where a high - resolution measurement was carried out using the @xmath1 inelastic scattering reaction . in its ground state ,",

    "the experiment was performed at the separated sector cyclotron facility at ithemba labs with the african omnipurpose detector for innovative techniques and experiments ( afrodite ) @xmath3-ray detector array @xcite in conjunction with two identical particle - telescopes , each of them consisting of two silicon detectors ( in @xmath9 configuration ) .",

    "the telescopes were placed at an angle of @xmath1445@xmath15 with respect to the beam axis .",
    "the dimensions of the w1-type double sided silicon strip detectors @xcite were 5 cm @xmath16 5 cm and consisted of 16 parallel and perpendicular strips 3 mm wide .",

    "thicknesses of the @xmath19__e _ _ and _ e _ detectors were 284 and 1000 @xmath11 m , respectively , and to suppress @xmath20 electrons an aluminum foil of 4.1 mg/@xmath12 areal density was placed in front of the @xmath19__e _ _ detectors .",
    "calibration of individual strips of the silicon detectors was performed using a @xmath21th @xmath1 source .",
    "afrodite , at the time of the experiment , consisted of nine clover hpge detectors with four detectors at 135@xmath22 and five at 90@xmath22 at a distance of 19.6 cm from the target .",
    "the detectors were calibrated using standard @xmath23eu and @xmath24co sources .",
    "high @xmath3-ray energy efficiency parameters for the afrodite array were available from ref .  @xcite .",
    "xia digital electronics @xcite was used to acquire timestamped online data in singles mode .",
    "from the timestamped data , events with single , double , and higher fold coincidences were constructed with an offline coincidence time window of 600 ns . from double fold events ,",
    "the @xmath25 coincidences were extracted by placing a gate on the @xmath10particles in the particle identification spectrum .",

    "additionally , various combination of angles between the direction of the recoiling nuclei ( as defined by the @xmath1 particles detected in the particle telescope ) and the @xmath3-rays detected in the clover detectors were used for the determination of angular distributions .",

    "the current result shows that many of the dipole excitations in the 6 @xmath34 9 mev range in @xmath0ge are mixed with larger isovector components .",
    "however , a few weakly populated pure isoscalar , as well as several pure isovector states are found for @xmath55 mev .",
    "these results indicate that the dipole excitations in @xmath0ge for @xmath49 6 mev do show the common scenario of dipole excitations splitting in two distinct parts : one at lower energy , whose states have a strong isospin mixing , and one at higher energy with predominant isovector character .",

    "parameters ( in the present version with the nl3@xmath57 @xcite interaction - 8 parameters ) of the cedft were fixed by fitting masses and radii of several characteristic nuclei throughout the nuclear chart @xcite and no adjustments were involved in the subsequent calculations .",
    "the calculations were performed in the following three steps : ( i ) the single - particle spectrum was obtained from the self - consistent relativistic mean - field solution ; ( ii ) the phonon spectrum was computed by the self - consistent relativistic quasiparticle random phase approximation ( rqrpa ) and ( iii ) the bethe - salpeter equation for the nuclear dipole response was solved within the rqtba employing the rqrpa phonons to construct the induced energy - dependent residual interaction .",
    "the low - energy region of the dipole spectrum is calculated with the rqtba .",

    "consequently , the isoscalar transition density has a pattern typical of the compressional mode with a node close to the nuclear surface .",
    "in contrast , the higher - lying state ( panel ( b ) ) exhibits the typical behavior of a pygmy dipole state where the proton and neutron transition densities are in phase inside the nucleus , while at the surface region the contribution comes from the neutron density only .",

    ", the presence of the coulomb interaction between the target and projectile has the capability to substantially contribute to the observed cross - sections @xcite . to investigate the effect of the coulomb interaction on the observed inelastic cross sections , theoretical cross sections were calculated both with and without taking the coulomb interaction into account .",

    "these results are shown in fig .",

    "it has been shown that the nuclear and coulomb contributions interfere constructively in the nuclear surface region @xcite .",
    "this feature is expected not to be visible for this relatively low incident energy since the coulomb contribution becomes important as the beam energy increases towards 30 mev / u @xcite .",
    "we are aware of the fact that , while the relation between the inelastic cross section and the @xmath62 is clear for the coulomb excitation ( they are proportional ) , the relation between the isoscalar response and the inelastic excitation cross section due to an isoscalar probe is not so evident .",
    "in fact , the ratio between the @xmath63 of the two states at 4.55 and 7.05 mev is 2.2 while the ratio between the corresponding values of the cross sections is 6.4 at the first maximum .",
    "if we eliminate the effect of the q - value , by placing the two states at the same energy , then the ratio decreases to 4.1 , still far from 2.2 .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite a calculation of the cross section was presented in the framework of a semiclassical model , that provides the missing link to directly compare the results from the microscopic rqtba calculations to experimental data measured via the ( @xmath1 , @xmath2@xmath3 ) reaction , confirming the structural splitting of the low - lying @xmath5 strength .",
    "it is instructive to also have an estimate of the cross - section of states with higher multipolarities .",
    "therefore , we also performed calculations for the first - excited 2@xmath58 state in @xmath0ge , using a collective macroscopic nuclear form factor .",

    "it is interesting to point to a recent measurement of the photon strength function below the neutron separation energy in @xmath0ge @xcite , using the so - called oslo method . despite the limited @xmath3-ray detection resolution , a broad structure",
    "is observed in the 6 @xmath66 8 mev range .",
    "it is highly probable that this feature is the same pygmy dipole resonance structure as observed in this work .",
    "we provide new results , which indicate a suppression in relative cross section for the excitation of the pdr in @xmath0ge populated through inelastic @xmath10scattering , when compared to photon scattering data for @xmath67 mev .",
    "the observed dipole response splits into two distinct parts : one at lower energy , with excitations that have strong isospin mixing , and one at higher energy with predominant isovector character .",

    "<S> isospin properties of dipole excitations in @xmath0ge are investigated using the ( @xmath1 , @xmath2@xmath3 ) reaction and compared to ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) data . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate that the dipole excitations in the energy region of 6 to 9 mev adhere to the scenario of the recently found splitting of the region of dipole excitations into two separated parts : one at low energy being populated by both isoscalar and isovector probes and the other at high energy , excited only by the electromagnetic probe . </S>",
    "<S> rqtba calculations show a reduction in the isoscalar @xmath5 strength with an increase in excitation energy which is consistent with the measurement . </S>"
