    "certainly , to calculate resonances in three body atomic systems the methods based on complex coordinates are the most popular . the complex rotation of the coordinates turns the resonant behavior of the wave function into a bound - state - like asymptotic behavior .",
    "then , standard bound - state methods become applicable also for calculating resonances .",
    "the complex rotation of the coordinates does not change the discrete spectrum , the branch cut , corresponding to scattering states , however , is rotated down onto the complex energy plane , and as a consequence , resonant states from the unphysical sheet become accessible .    in practice bound state",
    "variational approaches are used , that results in a discretization of the rotated continuum . by changing the rotation angle the points corresponding to the continuum move , while those corresponding to discrete states , like bound and resonant states , stay .",
    "this way one can determine resonance parameters .",
    "however , in practical calculations the points of the discretized continuum scatter around the rotated - down straight line .",
    "so , especially around thresholds it is not easy to decide whether a point is a resonance point or it belongs to the rotated continuum .    recently , we have developed a method for calculating resonances in three - body coulombic systems by solving homogeneous faddeev - merkuriev integral equations @xcite using the coulomb - sturmian separable expansion approach @xcite . as a test case , we calculated the resonances of the negative positronium ion .",
    "we found all the @xmath2 resonances presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and observed good agreements in all cases .    with our method we succeeded in locating @xmath3 more resonances in the same energy region , all of them are very close to the thresholds .",
    "this is certainly due to the fact that in ref .",
    "@xcite the threshold behaviors are exactly taken into account .",
    "unexpectedly we also observed that in the case of attractive coulomb interactions the faddeev - merkuriev integral equations produce numerous resonant solutions of dubious origin .",
    "we tend to regard them as spurious resonances which come about from the somewhat arbitrary splitting of the potential in the three - body configuration space into short - range and long - range terms , that is an inherent attribute of the theory .",
    "since the possible appearance of spurious states in the formalism is new and surprising , for the sake of the better understanding of its mechanism , in section 2 we outline briefly the faddeev - merkuriev integral equation formalism . in our particular case of the @xmath1 system two particles are identical and the set of faddeev - merkuriev integral equations can be reduced to an one - component equation . in section 3",
    "we discuss the spurious solutions . in section 4 the coulomb - sturmian separable expansion method",
    "is applied to the one - component integral equation . in section 5",
    "we present our new calculations for the @xmath4 resonances of the @xmath1 system and compare them with the results of the complex scaling calculations of ref .  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of a three - body coulombic system is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the three - body kinetic energy operator and @xmath7 denotes the coulomb potential in the subsystem @xmath8 , with @xmath9 .",
    "we use throughout the usual configuration - space jacobi coordinates @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "thus @xmath7 , the potential between particles @xmath12 and @xmath13 , depends on @xmath10 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) is defined in the three - body hilbert space .",
    "the three - body kinetic energy , when the center - of - mass motion is separated , is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the two - body kinetic energy .",
    "the two - body potential operators are formally embedded in the three - body hilbert space @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a unit operator in the two - body hilbert space associated with the @xmath18 coordinate .",
    "merkuriev proposed @xcite to split the coulomb interaction in the three - body configuration space into short- and long - range terms @xmath19 where the short- and long - range parts are defined via a splitting function : @xmath20 .",

    "so , the separation into short- and long - range parts is made along a parabola - like curve over the @xmath26 plane .",
    "typical shapes for @xmath27 and @xmath28 are shown in figures [ vs ] and [ vl ] , respectively .    in atomic three - particle systems",
    "the sign of the charge of two particles are always identical .",
    "let us denote in our @xmath1 system the two electrons by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and the positron by @xmath31 . in this case",
    "@xmath32 , the interaction between the two electrons , is a repulsive coulomb potential which does not support two - body bound states . therefore the entire @xmath32 can be considered as long - range potential . with splitting ( [ pot ] ) the hamiltonian",
    "can formally be written in a form which looks like an usual three - body hamiltonian with two short - range potentials @xmath33 where the long - range hamiltonian is defined as @xmath34 then , the faddeev method is applicable and , in this particular case , results in a splitting of the wave function into two components @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 is a complex number .    in the case of",
    "bound and resonant states the wave - function components satisfy the homogeneous two - component faddeev - merkuriev integral equations @xmath39 at real and complex energies , respectively . here",
    "@xmath40 is the resolvent of the channel long - ranged hamiltonian @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "merkuriev has proved that eqs .",
    "( [ fn - eq1]-[fn - eq2 ] ) possess compact kernels , and this property remains valid also for complex energies @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "further simplification can be achieved if we take into account that the two electrons , particles @xmath29 and @xmath30 , are identical and indistinguishable .",
    "then , the faddeev components @xmath45 and @xmath46 , in their own natural jacobi coordinates , have the same functional forms @xmath47 on the other hand @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the operator for the permutation of indexes @xmath29 and @xmath30 and @xmath50 are eigenvalues of @xmath49",
    ". therefore we can determine @xmath51 from the first equation only @xmath52 spurious resonance solutions ----------------------------    let us suppose for a moment that the @xmath53 parameter in @xmath54 is infinite .",
    "then @xmath21 would not depend on @xmath55 , the separation of the potential into short and long range parts would go along a straight line , and @xmath56 would be like a valley in the @xmath55 direction .",
    "the potential @xmath57 , which is coulomb - like along @xmath58 , would support infinitely many bound states and , as free motion along the coordinate @xmath55 would be possible , the hamiltonian @xmath59 would have infinitely many two - body channels .    if , however , @xmath53 is finite , the straight line along the @xmath55 direction becomes a parabola - like curve and the valley , as @xmath55 goes to infinity , gets broader and broader and shallower and shallower , and finally disappears ( see fig [ vl ] ) .",
    "as the valley gets closed the continuum of @xmath59 associated with the @xmath55 coordinate becomes discretized .",
    "so , if @xmath53 is finite , @xmath59 have infinitely many bound states .",
    "similar analysis is valid also for @xmath60 , and consequently , also @xmath61 has infinitely many bound states .",
    "this , however , due to ( [ filter ] ) , can lead to spurious solutions .",
    "if , at some energy , @xmath61 has bound state @xmath62 has pole . then , @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ filter ] ) , irrespective of @xmath64 , can be finite even if @xmath65 is infinitesimal .",
    "these solutions are called spurious solutions : although the faddeev components are not identically zero , but their sum vanishes .",
    "let us examine now the spectral properties of the hamiltonian @xmath66 the three - body potential @xmath67 is attractive and constructed so that @xmath68 vanishes as @xmath69 tends to infinity .",
    "therefore , there are no two - body channels associated with fragmentation @xmath30 , and of course neither with fragmentation @xmath31 , the hamiltonian @xmath70 has only @xmath29-type two - body asymptotic channels .    what happens to the bound states associated with @xmath67 ?",
    "they are embedded in the the continuum of @xmath71 , and become resonant states .",
    "so , by solving the faddeev - merkuriev integral equations , at some complex energies , we can encounter spurious solutions .",
    "these spurious solutions are not related to the hamiltonian @xmath72 , but rather only to some auxiliary potentials coming from the splitting procedure .",
    "consequently , the spurious resonances should be sensitive to the parameters of @xmath21 , while the physical resonances not . this way we can easily distinguish between physical and spurious resonance solutions .",
    "we solve eq .",
    "( [ fmp ] ) by using the coulomb  sturmian separable expansion approach @xcite .",

    "the cs functions @xmath77 form a biorthonormal discrete basis in the radial two - body hilbert space ; the biorthogonal partner is defined by @xmath78 . since the three - body hilbert space is a direct product of two - body hilbert spaces an appropriate basis can be defined as the angular momentum coupled direct product of the two - body bases @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are associated with the coordinates @xmath58 and @xmath55 , respectively . with this basis",
    "the completeness relation takes the form ( with angular momentum summation implicitly included ) @xmath82 note that similar bases can be constructed for fragmentations @xmath30 and @xmath31 as well .",

    "the most crucial point in this procedure is the calculation of the matrix elements @xmath97 , since the potential matrix elements @xmath98 and @xmath99 can always be evaluated numerically by making use of the transformation of jacobi coordinates @xcite .",
    "the green s operator @xmath100 is a resolvent of the sum of two commuting hamiltonians , @xmath101 , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 , which act in different two - body hilbert spaces .",
    "thus , @xmath100 can be given by a convolution integral of two - body green s operators , i.e. @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",

    "now , the spectra of @xmath117 and @xmath118 are well separated and the spectrum of @xmath119 can easily be encircled such that the spectrum of @xmath109 does not penetrate into the encircled area ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "next , the contour @xmath107 is deformed analytically in such a way that the upper part descends into the unphysical riemann sheet of @xmath119 , while the lower part of @xmath107 is detoured away from the cut ( fig .",
