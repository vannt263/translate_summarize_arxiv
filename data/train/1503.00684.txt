    "as the world power consumption and carbon emissions continue to increase , solar energy has drawn even more attention because it is clean , abundant , and sustainable , and thus is widely seen as a long - term substitute for traditional fossil fuels  @xcite .",
    "efficient solar energy conversion relies primarily on semiconducting photoabsorbers with a low band gap ( @xmath3 ) , allowing absorption of most of the solar light reaching the earth . with light absorption ,",
    "electrons are excited to the material s conduction band ( cb ) for electricity generation or catalysis  @xcite . however , the photo - excited electrons may also recombine radiatively or nonradiatively with the created holes , reducing the power conversion efficiency . in conventional solar cells ,",
    "this recombination rate is minimized by an externally engineered asymmetry , i.e. , electrons and holes are separated by the electric field in a @xmath4 junction or other interface .",
    "this not only complicates the device fabrication , but also imposes the shockley@xmath5queisser limit on the power conversion efficiency of this type of device  @xcite .",
    "ferroelectric ( fe ) solar converters , lacking inversion symmetry due to intrinsic spontaneous polarization , can separate photo - excited charges by the depolarization field or by the bulk photovoltaic effect ( bpve )  @xcite . in the bpve ,",
    "a spontaneous direct short - circuit photocurrent is generated when electrons are continuously excited to a quasiparticle coherent state that has an intrinsic momentum , avoiding the need for an interface to separate charge .",
    "in particular , the bpve is able to generate an above - band - gap photovoltage  @xcite , potentially enabling a higher power conversion efficiency than the shockley@xmath5queisser limit .",
    "however , most conventional ferroelectric materials have wide band gaps [ @xmath62.7 ev for bifeo@xmath1 , @xmath63.5 ev for pb(zr@xmath7ti@xmath7)o@xmath1 ] , limiting their ability to absorb the visible light that makes up the biggest fraction of the solar irradiance .",
    "thus , an enormous amount of efforts has been focused on the design and optimization of fe materials in order to reach a lower band gap  @xcite . among them , the study and improvement of ferroelectric oxides are particularly important , as these materials can be integrated into the conventional electronics  @xcite .",
    "in particular , recently a ferroelectric perovskite ( k , ba)(ni , nb)o@xmath0 ( kbnno ) has been successfully synthesized and demonstrated to have a near - optimal band gap ( 1.39 ev ) , exhibiting good photovoltaic ( pv ) performance  @xcite .",
    "while this has substantially advanced the area of ferroelectric photovoltaics , there remain open questions .",
    "for example , what is the underlying pv mechanism in this material ?",
    "furthermore , this material is also able to exhibit bpve , as previous time dependent perturbation theory analysis has shown that bpve , in principle , can arise in any polar material through the `` shift current '' mechanism  @xcite .",
    "actually this becomes even more fascinating when taking into account that the parent knbo@xmath1 is an interesting nonlinear optical ( nlo ) material with high nlo coefficients  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study the bpve and its correlation to structural and electronic properties in kbnno and knbo@xmath1 from first principles .",
    "the connection between the photocurrent and electronic structure elucidated here is not only useful for understanding other pv mechanisms in kbnno in the sense that all these pv mechanisms relate to the light absorption and the motion of the photo - excited carriers and thus to the electronic properties , but also can be generalized to other similar materials that have great tunability of orbital character near the band gap .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) calculations were performed with the local density approximation ( lda ) functional , as implemented in the quantum - espresso code  @xcite .",
    "norm - conserving , optimized nonlocal pseudopotentials were used to represent all elements  @xcite .",
    "the dft+@xmath9 method was used to improve the description of @xmath10-orbital electrons by better accounting for the correlation effect , with hubbard @xmath9 parameterized by the linear - response approach  @xcite .",
    "the calculated hubbard @xmath9 values are 3.6 ev for nb in knbo@xmath1 , and 3.97 ev and 9.90 ev for nb and ni in kbnno .",
    "the shift current was calculated with a previously developed first - principles approach based on time - dependent perturbation theory , which yields good agreement with experiment for the prototypical ferroelectric oxides , such as bifeo@xmath1  @xcite . to calculate the shift current , a self - consistent calculation",
    "was first done by the lda+@xmath9 approach for the structures fully relaxed by lda , followed by non - self - consistent calculations with much finer @xmath11 grids .",
    "we used the lda relaxed structures for shift current calculations , as lda was shown to describe well the knbo@xmath1 structural properties , with only 0.3% underestimation of the tetragonality @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the monkhorst - pack @xmath11-mesh method  @xcite was used to sample the brillouin zone . to converge the shift current",
    ", the @xmath11 grid must be sufficiently dense , e.g. , a 40@xmath1340 @xmath11 grid was used for a typical @xmath14o@xmath1 unit cell . in order to overcome the self - interaction error of the standard dft method",
    ", we also used the hse06 hybrid functional to calculate the band gaps of some compositions  @xcite . the hse06 hybrid functional improves the band gap description by including a proportion of the exact exchange interaction , while the correlation part remains the same as in the standard dft method ; it only serves as a corroboration of the band gap here .",
    "we also adopted the gga+@xmath9 method to calculate the shift current of knbo@xmath1 and some kbnno structures , and confirmed that the shift current spectral features are essentially similar to those obtained by the lda+@xmath9 method ( the change of the shift current magnitude is tiny ) , except for slightly larger onset photon energies in the gga+@xmath9 case .",
    "shift current , as a dominant mechanism for the bpve , is a second - order nonlinear optical effect with the photocurrent quadratic in the electric field ( @xmath15 )  @xcite .",
    "the glass coefficient @xmath16 describes the current response in a thick sample and includes the light attenuation effect due to the absorption coefficient @xmath17 .",
    "we start by calculating the shift current of the parent material knbo@xmath1 .",
    "knbo@xmath1 is a typical @xmath14o@xmath1 perovskite ferroelectric oxide that occurs in various different phases . at temperatures above 691 k ,",
    "knbo@xmath1 is in a paraelectric cubic phase with space group @xmath18 .",
    "as the temperature decreases below 691 k , it first undergoes a phase transition into a tetragonal phase ( space group @xmath19 ) , and then into an orthorhombic phase at 498 k ( space group @xmath20 ) and an even more distorted rhombohedral phase with space group @xmath21 at 263 k. concurrently with the structural transitions from cubic to tetragonal , orthorhombic , and rhombohedral phases , the nbo@xmath22 octahedra become more severely distorted through octahedral tilting and rotation , and the nb ions move away from the center of the o@xmath22 cages . as a typical @xmath14o@xmath1 perovskite semiconductor / insulator",
    ", the valence band maximum ( vbm ) of knbo@xmath1 arises mainly from the o 2@xmath23 orbitals , while the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) is predominantly composed of nb 4@xmath10 orbitals  @xcite .",
    "also , the band gap of knbo@xmath1 increases significantly when the structure changes from cubic to the more distorted rhombohedral phase , because of the correlation between the nbo@xmath22 octahedral distortion and nb ions off - center displacements and the electronic structure  @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , experiment finds a wide range of band gap values , from 3.3 ev for the cubic phase  @xcite to 4.4 ev for the tetragonal phase  @xcite .",
    "our previous hse06 calculation also shows that the band gap of the rhombohedral knbo@xmath1 is @xmath240.6 ev larger than that of its tetragonal counterpart ( table  [ tab : hse ] )  @xcite .",
    ".the hse06 band gap of various knbo@xmath1 phases ( cubic , tetragonal , orthorhombic , and rhombohedral ) and two different cation arrangements ( @xmath25 and rocksalt ) of the ( k , ba)(ni , nb)o@xmath2 ( kbnno ) solid solutions .",
    "kbnno has much smaller band gaps than knbo@xmath1 .",
    "all structures are fully relaxed with lda . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : o - vacancy ]    in kbnno , some of the original nb@xmath26 ions are substituted by ni@xmath27 ions ( ni@xmath28 ) , with the charge compensated by the combination of @xmath29-site substitution of ba@xmath27 for k@xmath30 ions ( ba@xmath31 ) and o vacancies ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "generally , the o vacancies prefer to form adjacent to the ni@xmath27 dopant , because the possible o vacancy as a donor is attracted by the ni@xmath28 acceptor .",
    "however , there are still three inequivalent o vacancy sites adjacent to ni : the top apical site ( with the ni@xmath28-@xmath32 local polarization parallel to the overall polarization ) , the equatorial site , and the bottom apical site ( with the ni@xmath28-@xmath32 local polarization antiparallel to the overall polarization ) .",
    "we study extensively the stabilities of different o vacancy sites by using supercells with different compositions or cation arrangements , including both layered and rocksalt @xmath33-cation structures ( fig .",
    "[ 2kno - struc ] ) .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : o - vacancy ] , in the @xmath34 layered supercells , the equatorial o vacancy site is much more stable than both the top and bottom apical sites .",
    "this is because when the o vacancy is located at the equatorial site , a network of -ni - v@xmath35-ni- forms .",
    "the attractive coulomb interaction between the donor @xmath32 and acceptor ni@xmath28 decreases the total energy , resulting in a more nearly uniform charge distribution than the other two cases . also , the top apical site is slightly more favorable than the bottom apical site because of the repulsive interaction between the @xmath32 and ba@xmath31 donors .",
    "however , in the rocksalt arrangement , there is no preferred o vacancy site , as the charge environment is nearly isotropic for different orientations of the ni - v@xmath35 complex .",
    "even though the ni@xmath28-@xmath32 local polarization can be parallel or antiparallel to the overall polarization , it has minor effect on the preference of the o vacancy site .",
    "basically , the rocksalt arrangement is about 100 mev / atom less stable than the @xmath25 layered arrangement with equatorial o vacancies , but more stable than that with apical o vacancies .",
    "overall , we see a clear effect of the coulomb interaction and charge compensation mechanism on determining the favorable o vacancy site .    to study the effect of different oxygen vacancy sites and cation arrangements on shift current",
    ", we calculate the shift current of the @xmath25 layered supercells both with equatorial and apical o vacancies , as well as the rocksalt @xmath33-cation arrangement .",
    "although the layered structures with a high concentration of vacancies may be experimentally difficult to synthesize under normal conditions , they serve as good examples to elucidate the stability of o vacancies and their effects on shift current .",
    "figure  [ sc-2unit ] shows the calculated shift current susceptibilities and glass coefficients of these three different structures of the ( k , ba)(ni , nb)o@xmath2 solid solution .",
    "several features are clear from the comparison of these results .",
    "first , the glass coefficient of the layered arrangement with apical o vacancies ( 5@xmath3610@xmath37 m / v ) is approximately 12 times larger than that of the prototypical ferroelectric photovoltaic bifeo@xmath1 ( 0.4@xmath3610@xmath37 m / v ) for the photon energies between its @xmath3 and @xmath3 + 1.0 ev , but the required photon energies in kbnno are much lower , at the lda+@xmath9 level of 1.0 ev .",
    "the low band gap of this kbnno solid solution is further corroborated by its hse06 band gap of 1.28 ev ( table  [ tab : hse ] ) .",
    "therefore , this cation arrangement would be a great bulk photovoltaic in a thick sample if the vacancy locations can be controlled .",
    "compared to the glass coefficient spectrum , there is not any peak in the shift current susceptibility spectrum or in the shift vector spectrum for photon energies near 1 ev . the glass coefficient is large because the absorption coefficient at these energies is extremely small .",
    "these electronic transitions are mainly from the o 2@xmath23 orbital dominated valence band ( vb ) to the cb that is composed of nb 4@xmath38 and ni 3@xmath38 orbitals as well as o 2@xmath39 .",
    "the transitions near the @xmath29(0.5 , 0.5 , 0.5 ) point of the brillouin zone are not localized at the sublattice around ni , but broadly distributed over the whole lattice [ fig .",
    "[ fig3 - 4](a ) ] .     layered ( k , ba)(ni , nb)o@xmath2 solid solution ( a ) with apical and",
    "( b ) equatorial o vacancies .",
    "the inset shows the real - space wavefuction distribution for the corresponding conduction electronic states at @xmath29(0.5 , 0.5 , 0.5 ) @xmath11 point in ( a ) and @xmath40 @xmath11 point in ( b ) .",
    "the wavefunction plot in ( a ) is in view along @xmath41 , while the left and right insets in ( b ) are in views along @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the k and ba ions are not shown in the wavefunction plot .",
    "[ fig3 - 4 ] ]    second , both the shift current susceptibility and glass coefficient of the @xmath25 layered kbnno with apical o vacancies are much larger than those of layered kbnno with equatorial o vacancies for almost the whole spectral range .",
    "this is because both the imaginary dielectric constant and the shift vector of the layered apical vacancy structure are larger than those of the layered equatorial vacancy one .",
    "figure  [ fig3 - 4 ] shows the band structure of the @xmath25 layered kbnno solid solutions with equatorial and apical o vacancies . unlike the apical case , where the band - edge transitions are near the @xmath29 point , in the equatorial structure they mainly occur near the @xmath40 point . in the latter case",
    ", the cbm has a major contribution from the nb 4@xmath43 orbital [ fig .",
    "[ fig3 - 4](b ) ] .",
    "unlike the @xmath38 orbital , the @xmath43 orbital is distributed within the @xmath44 plane that is perpendicular to the shift current direction ( @xmath42 ) , leading to a much smaller onset glass coefficient for the equatorial case . when the equatorial o vacancies are organized along the @xmath41 direction , a chain of -ni - v@xmath35-ni- formed . since the remaining nio@xmath45 complex prefers a square planar symmetry in the perpendicular @xmath46 plane , the overall lattice asymmetry along the @xmath42 direction is significantly reduced . on the other hand , removing the o atom at apical site leads to a larger @xmath47 lattice constant and an overall enhancement of the lattice asymmetry along the @xmath42 direction . the combined effect of the different lattice asymmetries and the orbital character change dictates the change of the shift current magnitude .",
    "solid solution with @xmath25 layered and rocksalt cation arrangements .",
    "the inset shows the real - space wavefunction distribution ( view along @xmath41 ) for the corresponding electronic states as indicated by the red arrow . in both cases ,",
    "the o vacancy is at the top apical site . in ( a ) ,",
    "the equatorial o atom nearest to the viewer is hidden in order to show the orbital character of the ni 3@xmath48 orbitals .",
    "[ pdos-112-rs ] ]    also , comparison of the layered and rocksalt cation arrangements , both with the apical o vacancies , shows that the rocksalt cation arrangement exhibits a much larger shift current susceptibility , albeit with a higher onset photon energies , whereas its glass coefficient is smaller at lower energies ( < 2.8 ev ) but greater at higher energies ( > 2.8 ev ) with respect to that of the layered arrangement ( fig .",
    "[ sc-2unit ] ) .",
    "simultaneously , the imaginary dielectric constant , which is proportional to the transition rate , of the rocksalt cation arrangement is also smaller for photon energies smaller than 2.8 ev , but greater for the photon energies above 2.8 ev .",
    "comparison of the shift vector shows that even though the rocksalt arrangement has a smaller shift vector for the whole spectral range , the difference in the magnitude is decreasing with increasing photon energies .",
    "figure  [ pdos-112-rs ] shows the pdoss of both the @xmath25 layered and rocksalt cation arrangements . clearly , the top of the vb has ni 3@xmath48 orbitals in the layered arrangement , but the vb has ni 3@xmath43 orbitals in the rocksalt arrangement , leading to a preferred motion of the shift current carriers and a larger onset glass coefficient in the layered arrangement for the electronic transitions at the band edge .",
    "however , as the absorbed photon energies increase and states below the vb becomes involved , ni 3@xmath38 orbitals become more important for the rocksalt cation arrangement while ni 3@xmath43 orbitals play a greater role for the layered arrangement .",
    "this leads to a steady enhancement of the shift vector magnitude in the rocksalt but not in the layered cation arrangement .",
    "furthermore , the electronic states of both the vbs and cbs in the rocksalt cation arrangement are much more localized than those in the layered structure .",
    "this gives rise to a more sharply peaked dos contributing to electronic transitions in a narrower range of photon energies [ fig .",
    "[ pdos-112-rs](c ) ] , in agreement with the overall greater transition rate in the rocksalt cation arrangement .",
    "combined , these two effects dictate the greater shift current susceptibility in the rocksalt cation arrangement .",
    "these features are not readily evident from the glass coefficient , as the glass coefficient includes the light attenuation effect represented by the absorption coefficient ( imaginary dielectric constant ) that relates to the strength of the electronic transitions .",
    "consequently , the glass coefficient of the rocksalt cation arrangement is only moderately larger than that of the layered cation arrangement and only for high photon energies .",
    "this more localized nature of the electronic states in the rocksalt cation arrangement can be ascribed to its structural properties .",
    "compared to the layered arrangement , in the rocksalt cation arrangement the -ni - v@xmath35-ni- network is interrupted by the nb atoms , leading to more localized ni 3@xmath10 orbital states in the cb .",
    "this narrower bandwidth of the cb not only induces a larger band gap ( table  [ tab : hse ] ) and a higher shift current onset photon energy , but also an overall enhancement of the shift current magnitude .",
    "therefore , we see that the resulting shift current is significantly affected by the orbital character of the electronic transitions and the localization of these electronic states , which are in turn affected by the structural properties including the lattice asymmetry , the cation arrangement , and the location of the o vacancies .",
    "the above solid solutions have a fairly high concentration of o vacancies , which could impede the motion of the photocurrent carriers , because they may behave as recombination centers .",
    "if so , it would be necessary to reduce the amount of o vacancies while preserving the beneficial effects of o vacancies in reducing the band gap and enhancing the visible - light absorption . in the following ,",
    "we study the shift current of kbnno with a lower concentration of o vacancies .",
    "these kbnno solid solutions have the compositions of ( 1-@xmath41)knbo@xmath1-@xmath41ba(ni@xmath7nb@xmath7)o@xmath49 ( @xmath41=2/3 , 1/2 , and 1/3 ) , with a vacancy concentration of 5.6% , 4.2% , and 2.7% , respectively .",

    "two nb@xmath26 ions are replaced with two ni@xmath27 ions , and the charge is compensated by the combination of an o vacancy adjacent to ni and four k@xmath30 ions randomly substituted by the ba@xmath27 ions ( ba@xmath53 ) .",
    "[ g - composition ] shows the calculated glass coefficient of different kbnno compositions .",
    "all three solid solutions exhibit a maximum glass coefficient with photon energies @xmath241.9 ev .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath41=1/2 composition has the lowest onset photon energy , as its direct band gap is the smallest among all three kbnno solid solutions",
    ". it also exhibits the largest glass coefficient ( 3.8@xmath3610@xmath37 m / v ) for the photon energies below 3.0 ev , which is ten times larger than the maximum glass coefficient of bifeo@xmath1 ( 0.4@xmath3610@xmath37 m / v ) .",
    "similarly , the difference in the magnitude of the glass coefficient is attributed to the different orbital compositions of the contributing electronic states . for the @xmath41=2/3 composition ,",
    "the top of the vb is predominantly composed of o 2@xmath23 orbitals combined with a slight contribution of the ni and nb @xmath48 orbitals .",

    ", we apply in - plane compressive strains to the 2/3knbo@xmath1 - 1/3ba(ni@xmath7nb@xmath7)o@xmath49 solid solution , in which the two ni atoms are distributed along the body diagonal positions ( @xmath55 ) . in this configuration ,",
    "the o vacancy is adjacent to only one ni atom , leaving an o@xmath2 environment around this ni , but an o@xmath22 environment to the other ni .",
    "figure  [ strain ] shows the calculated glass coefficient as a function of the in - plane compressive strain .",
    "it is evident that the magnitude of the glass coefficient decreases steadily with increasing in - plane compressive strain .",
    "concurrently , the shift current onset photon energy also increases , suggesting a bigger band gap with enhanced strains .",
    "this is contrary to the naive expectation that the magnitude of the glass coefficient will increase with strain because of the polarization rotation towards the [ 001 ] direction and the overall enhancement of the structural asymmetry along the @xmath42 direction when applying in - plane compressive strains .",
    "however , this change can also be rationalized by the electronic structure and wavefunction analysis .",
    "pdos analysis shows that the impurity state that is originally above the top of the vb shifts downwards and finally merges into it as the in - plane compressive strain increases [ figs .",
    "[ dos - ab](a ) and [ strain](b ) ] .",
    "concurrently , the vb edge becomes predominantly composed of o 2@xmath23 orbitals [ fig .",
    "[ strain](b ) ] , in comparison to the significant contribution of the @xmath38 orbital for the configuration without strain .",
    "this not only gives rise to a larger band gap , but also affects the motion of the shift current carriers , leading to the observed reduction of the glass coefficient .",
    "further examination of the structure shows that the difference between the ni - o distance in plane and that along the @xmath42 direction is substantially enhanced when the in - plane compressive strain increases .",
    "this results in a larger splitting between the @xmath38 and @xmath66 orbitals for the ni with an o@xmath75 environment , becoming similar to the ni atom in an o@xmath2 environment ( fig .",
    "[ d - splitting ] ) .",
    "this shifts downwards the original @xmath38 orbital dominated gap state , giving rise to both a larger band gap and a smaller glass coefficient .",
    "in summary , we study the bulk photovoltaic effect of the prototypical knbo@xmath1 and visible - light ferroelectric photovoltaic ( k , ba)(ni , nb)o@xmath0 from first principles .",
    "the effect of lattice distortion , oxygen vacancies , cation arrangement , composition , and strain on shift current are systematically studied .",
    "we find that the maximum shift current response ( with uv absorption ) of the orthorhombic knbo@xmath1 is more than twice that of bifeo@xmath1 , although knbo@xmath1 has a wider band gap .",
    "furthermore , the band - edge shift current response of the tetragonal knbo@xmath1 is smaller than that of its rhombohedral counterpart .",
    "this occurs because a more isotropic lattice distortion in the rhombohedral phase reduces the splitting between the @xmath43 and @xmath76 orbitals , leading to a larger electronic contribution of the @xmath42-direction - extended state to the shift current .",
    "in ( k , ba)(ni , nb)o@xmath0 , the charge compensation affects significantly the favorable location of oxygen vacancies , with more stable o vacancy location based on more effective charge compensation . the layered arrangement with apical o vacancies exhibits a much larger shift current response than that with equatorial o vacancies , as the lattice asymmetry is enhanced in the former , but reduced in the latter case .",
    "compared to the layered arrangement , the rocksalt arrangement has more localized electronic states , giving rise to a larger density of electronic transitions within a narrower energy range . combined with the effect of the more extended @xmath38 orbital , this gives rise to a larger shift current susceptibility .",
    "the effect of composition and @xmath29-cation arrangement on shift current is moderate , whereas the @xmath33-cation arrangement substantially affects both the electronic structure and the shift current , which can be rationalized by crystal field theory analysis . with an o@xmath22 environment around some of the ni",
    ", the band gap is lowered , and the final shift current yield is enhanced .",
    "the effect of strain on shift current is indirect , through the change of the wavefunction nature of the contributing electronic states , which can be used to engineer the shift current in a predictable fashion .",
    "it is noteworthy that the shift current response of ( k , ba)(ni , nb)o@xmath0 is comparable to that of bifeo@xmath1 , but at a much lower photon energy .",
    "more importantly , the order of magnitude enhancement of the shift current response can be gained by simply layering the ( k , ba)(ni , nb)o@xmath2 solid solution , with its glass coefficient reaching 12 times that of bifeo@xmath1 .",
    "finally , we have demonstrated extensively that the shift current is dictated by the wavefuction nature of the contributing electronic orbitals , which are in turn unanimously related to their structural properties .",
    "therefore , we have built up a bridge between materials structural properties and their photovoltaic performances , and provided a pathway for analyzing and elucidating the connections among these different physical properties .",
    "the elucidated connection between materials structure , electronic structure , and shift current is useful for the design of bulk photovoltaic materials and understanding their pv mechanisms .",
