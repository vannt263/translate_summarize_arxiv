    "molecular potential energy curves are the foundation of understanding atomic interactions",
    ". accurate knowledge of these potentials is essential to implement and analyze many experiments with cold and ultracold molecules @xcite .",
    "cold molecules are important for a number of areas of interest , such as tests of fundamental symmetries , ultracold chemistry , quantum degenerate gases characterized by strong anisotropic dipole - dipole interactions , and quantum computation ( @xcite and references within ) .",
    "the most accurate potential curves are those based on experimental determination of the vibrational energy level spectrum .",
    "traditional molecular spectroscopy provides much of this data , but is often limited to spectra near the minimum of broad molecular potentials .",
    "twenty years ago , the advent of laser cooling and trapping allowed a new technique , photoassociative spectroscopy ( pa ) , to access high - lying vibrational states of excited @xcite and ground @xcite state molecular potentials .",
    "while for a few systems these techniques overlap to provide a complete picture of the interatomic interaction @xcite , for many others , a substantial gap exists .",
    "for example , for the @xmath7 state of @xmath3rb@xmath4 , bound - bound spectroscopy has determined the energies of the @xmath8 to 14 vibrational states @xcite , and photoassociative spectroscopy has determined the binding energies of the vibrational levels between @xmath9 and 171 @xcite . combining the two data sets",
    "leaves roughly 150 unknown vibrational energies .",
    "many more vibrational energies , including those studied here , can be identified in the photoassociation spectra of ref @xcite , but in this paper binding energies were not given .    in 2008 , ct and colleagues suggested that feshbach resonances could be used to systematically enhance pa and optimize the production of cold molecules @xcite .",
    "this technique , feshbach optimized photoassociation ( fopa ) modifies the wavefunction of the colliding atoms to optimize the creation of molecules in the desired vibrational states .",
    "additional calculations showed that fopa may be used to create heternuclear lics molecules @xcite , to study the time variation of the electron - to - proton mass ratio @xcite , and to test the unitarity limit @xcite .",
    "in fact , the first observation of a feshbach resonance in ultracold collisions was made by observing the enhancement of the photoassociation rate @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we observe feshbach optimized photoassociation of @xmath3rb@xmath4 formed in deeply - bound vibrational levels of the @xmath7 electronic potential that connects to the 5@xmath10s@xmath2 + 5@xmath10p@xmath2 separated atoms limit .",
    "we focus on atoms that collide in the entrance channel @xmath11 + @xmath11 , which couples at small internuclear separation to other hyperfine states with total angular momentum projection quantum number @xmath12 .",
    "these atoms form a broad feshbach resonance centered at an external magnetic field strength of 155 g. specifically , we measure the binding energies of the @xmath5 , 140 , and 150 vibrational states .",
    "we also measure the magnetic field position and width of each fopa resonance , and compare the results to those from to a multi - channel @xmath13-wave scattering calculation .",
    "previous experimental and theoretical studies have investigated feshbach resonance and photoassociation .",
    "the first observation of a feshbach resonance using pa also demonstrated fopa for the @xmath14 state of the @xmath7 potential in @xmath3rb@xmath4 @xcite . a later study on @xmath15cs@xmath4 @xcite used a feshbach resonance to enhance the photoassociation rate into many deeply - bound vibrational levels of the @xmath7 excited molecular potential .",

    "photoassociaton begins with two free colliding atoms under the influence of a ground - state molecular potential .",
    "these atoms are associated into an excited - state molecule by a photon @xcite ( figure  [ pa ] ) .",

    ", width=7 ]    the rate of photoassociation can be estimated by the franck - condon factor , the space - integral of the product of the ground- and excited - state wavefunctions .",
    "because of the asymmetry of the excited - state confining potential , the amplitude of the wavefunction is concentrated near the outer turning point . since the free wavefunctions have large amplitudes at large atomic separation , the frank - condon factors are largest for the highest - lying vibrational levels of the excited molecular potential .",
    "the photoassociation rate generally decreases for more deeply - bound vibrational levels , which have turning points at shorter internuclear separation .",
    "also , oscillations in this rate can reflect the oscillations of the ground - state wavefunction amplitude @xcite    the electronic molecular potential of two ground - state rubidium atoms has multiple dissociation energies corresponding to different combinations of hyperfine energies of the constituent atoms .",
    "their relative dissociation energies can be adjusted relative to each other by an external magnetic field . thus ,",
    "if two atoms are colliding along one interaction potential , their collision energy can be made equal to the energy of a molecular state with a slightly higher dissociation energy by applying the appropriate magnetic field ( figure  [ fr ] ) .",
    "this feshbach resonance @xcite couples the molecular potentials and dramatically alters the collision wavefunction , especially at small internuclear separation .",
    "this , in turn , changes the photoassociation rate into the electronically excited molecular potential . utilizing this process",
