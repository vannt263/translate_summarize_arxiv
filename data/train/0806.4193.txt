    "spintronic@xcite has proved to be of great technological importance with the development of memory storage devices and magnetic sensors based on giant magnetoresistance ( gmr)@xcite and tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr).@xcite more recently , one of the major achievements in the spintronic field was the coherent control of single electron spins in quantum dots.@xcite such a control is a fundamental step toward the generation of quantum bits based on the electron spin for further implementation of quantum computers.@xcite there are a few recently developed techniques to manipulate coherently the electron spin in quantum dots . in those techniques square pulses of bias or gate voltages are applied in order to prepare and measure spin states.@xcite this turns quite desirable the study of quantum transport in the presence of pulses of bias voltage . for single level quantum dots coupled to nonmagnetic leads , it is well known that coherent oscillations ( ringing ) of the current appear when a step like bias voltage is applied across the junction.@xcite in the presence of ferromagnetic leads and/or zeeman - split level , though , it was found that the ringing response of the current develops spin fingerprints.@xcite additionally , polarized current spikes can be generated when a bias voltage is abruptly turned off.@xcite    systems with high tmr values are of current interest in spintronics , motivated mainly by magnetic memory and sensor applications.@xcite recently , it was found relatively high tmr values ( 80%-200% ) in magnetic tunnel junction ( mtj ) consisting of fe and co spaced by an oxide layer.@xcite in particular , if instead of an insulator layer we have a quantum dot sandwiched by two ferromagnetic leads,@xcite it is possible to have additional effects , like spin - accumulation and strong coulomb interaction that result in a more wealth physics of the tmr response.@xcite    in the present work we extend the recent study in ref .",
    "@xcite by considering a sequence of square pulses of bias voltage instead of only a single pulse .",
    "a study on electron spin dynamics when a sequence of voltage pulses is applied in a quantum dot system , was recently developed by stefanucci.@xcite since square waves are of fundamental importance for the conventional electronics ( e.g. digital switching circuits , synchronous logic circuits , binary logic devices)@xcite we believe that it is relevant to consider the interplay between square waves of bias voltage and spin dependent phenomena .",
    "the calculation presented here is based on the nonequilibrium green function technique .",
    "the main finding is a wave - like behavior of the spin accumulation , spin current and tmr , that can switch sign periodically as the time evolves . in particular ,",
    "the tmr develops a periodic singularity that results in relatively high tmr and a fast switching of its sign .",

    "in the present work we assume @xmath59 .",
    "the others quantities involved are the dot s level @xmath60 , the voltages intensities @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , the pulse width and the inverval between pulses , @xmath64 , and the temperature @xmath65 . in what follows we present the results .",
    "figures [ fig2](a)-(b ) show the spin resolved dot occupations in both ( a ) p and ( b ) ap alignments .",
    "when the bias is turned on ( @xmath66 ) the occupations increase in time due to the resonant condition @xmath67 that is achieved inside the pulse length . in the parallel configuration @xmath68 presents a stepper enhancement compared to @xmath69 .",
    "this is related to the inequality @xmath70 , that gives a faster response for the incoming up spins .",
    "as the time evolves @xmath68 and @xmath69 tend to the same value , inside the pulse .",
    "in contrast , in the ap alignment @xmath68 tends to saturate above @xmath69 .",
    "these asymptotic behaviors can be easily understood in terms of the tunneling rates in both alignments . while in the p case @xmath71 , thus resulting in @xmath72 in the stationary limit , in the ap configuration @xmath73 and @xmath74 , which gives rise to @xmath75 in the stationary limit .",
    "when the bias voltage is turned off ( @xmath76 ) the level @xmath77 becomes above @xmath78 and @xmath79 , thus the spin populations in the dot discharge toward the leads .",
    "the minimum values achieved by @xmath68 and @xmath69 during the discharge process come from thermal excitation .",
    "note that just before a pulse of bias voltage we find @xmath75 in the p case while @xmath72 in the ap configuration .",
    "this is related to the broadening of the dot level @xmath77 that is spin dependent , even though it is spin degenerate . since in the p case @xmath80 the level broadening for spin up is larger than for spin down .",
    "this makes thermal excitations more pronounced for spins up than for spins down , thus resulting in an equilibrium spin accumulation . in the ap alignment since",
    "@xmath81 the thermal excitation is equally distributed for both spins . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) we show the spin accumulation in the dot , @xmath82 . for ap configuration @xmath83 changes intensity preserving its sign .",
    "in contrast , in the p alignment @xmath83 oscillates between positive and negative values as the time evolves .",
    "the sign reversion of @xmath83 in the p case comes from the faster charge / discharge of spin up electrons in the dot , compared to the spin down electrons .",
    "figure [ fig3](a ) shows the spin currents ( @xmath84)@xcite in the emitter ( left ) and collector ( right ) lead in both magnetic alignments .",
    "observe that just after a bias voltage is turned on , both @xmath85 and @xmath86 are on top of each other . as the time evolves @xmath86",
    "is suppressed to zero while @xmath87 tends to a nonzero stationary value .",
    "in contrast , when the bias voltage is turned off , @xmath86 assumes transient values higher in modulos than @xmath87 .",
    "the negative values of the spin currents just after a pulse end means that the spin current is discharging into the emitter lead with a majority up component.@xcite in contrast , in the collector lead [ fig . [",
    "fig3](b ) ] @xmath86 is aproximatelly zero throughout time , with small oscillations ( ringing like ) whenever a bias voltage is turned on or off .",
    "in contrast , @xmath85 assumes relatively high negative values . comparing figs . [ fig3](a ) and [ fig3](b ) we note that in a transient regime the spin current that leaves the emitter does not arrive in the collector lead .",
    "similarly to the total current ( @xmath88 ) that has a continuity equation given by @xmath89 where @xmath90 , the total spin current satisfies the following continuity equation @xmath91 which was used to check the accuracy of our numerical results .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the tmr@xmath92 against time in the left ( solid line ) and right ( dotted line ) leads . here",
    "@xmath93 and @xmath94 means the total current ( @xmath95 ) in the parallel and antiparallel configurations , respectively . in the time range",
    "in which @xmath96 the tmr increases up to 200 - 300% due to the relatively slow discharging of spin down electrons from the dot into the leads in the parallel configuration .",
    "this sustains @xmath93 much longer than @xmath94 , thus enhancing the tmr along the time .",
    "note that in the parallel case the spin down electron in the dot is weakly coupled to both leads ( majority spin up population in both sides ) , while in the antiparallel case both spin components are strongly coupled to at least one electrode .",
    "this turns the spin down discharging process slower in the parallel case , thus resulting in a maintenance of the total current @xmath93 for longer times compared to @xmath94 .",
    "it is valid to mention that whenever a bias voltage is turned off the tmr develops a singularity as described in the next figure .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the tmr and the total currents @xmath93 and @xmath94 in a time range around @xmath97 . the divergence and sign change of the tmr observed in this figure",
    "is related to the spin - dependent discharging process of the dot .",
    "note that after the bias voltage is turned off ( at @xmath97 ) the currents @xmath93 and @xmath94 transiently pass from direct ( positive ) to reverse ( negative ) currents . during this transition",
    "the current @xmath94 crosses the zero value before @xmath93 and attains a slightly more negative value than @xmath93 .",
    "this turns into a singularity in the tmr and a change of its sign .",
    "we calculate spin polarized current , spin accumulation and tmr in a quantum dot coupled to ferromagnetic leads in the presence of a bias voltage that evolves in time as a square - wave .",
    "we report a wave like spin accumulation that switches sign in each period when the leads are parallel aligned .",
    "we also found a much larger spin current in the antiparallel configuration during the transient discharging process , which quite contrasts with the stationary regime where we find an antiparallel spin current equal zero .",
    "finally , we find a large enhancement of the tmr in the time range in between bias voltage pulses .",
    "this is due to the slow discharge of the spin down electrons in the parallel configuration .",
    "a sign reversion of the tmr is also observed in the emitter lead , which is related to a sign change of the current .",
