    "in the following , we show on a mean - field level the formal equivalence of the bose - hubbard model including infinite - range interactions and the bose - hubbard model including nearest neighbour interactions . combining the approximation made in equation ( [ thetaapprox ] ) with hamiltonian ( [ bhham ] ) describing the system with infinite - range interactions results in the effective hamiltonian :",
