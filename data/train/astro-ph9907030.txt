    "at present there is a need for viable source models capable of producing the large energy ( @xmath6 ergs ) necessary to power distant gamma - ray bursts such as grb971214 ( e.g.  @xcite ) and grb990123 ( @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we present a model for the production of such large bursts based on results of calculations of the energy emission from vacuum polarization processes around an embh .",
    "damour & ruffini ( 1975 ) indicated a very precise mechanism to explain the origin of gamma ray bursts : the vacuum polarization of a kerr - newman embh via the heisenberg - euler - schwinger process .",
    "they showed how these processes , occurring for embh s all the way up to @xmath0 , can radiate a large fraction of the extractable energy of the embh , in the sense of the black holes reversible transformations ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , after the discovery of the gamma ray afterglow by the beppo sax satellite and their optical identification ( e.g.  @xcite ) , this model has been reconsidered by ruffini ( 1998 ) who introduced the new concept of the  dyadosphere \" of an embh and by preparata et al .",
    "( 1998a,1998b ) who have given details of the spatial density and energy distribution in the electron - positron plasma created in the dyadosphere .",
    "the present paper examines the time evolution of such an electron - positron plasma by assuming an embh in vacuum and calculates the consequences .",
    "past work on black hole formation by wilson ( 1975 , 1977 ) has shown that highly charged embh s with charge to mass ratio @xmath7 , surrounded by an oppositely charged magnetosphere , may form during the collapse of rotating magnetized stars . for a low mass star to collapse and form a highly charged black hole , surrounded by an oppositely charged magnetosphere , strong initial fields and rapid rotation are required .",
    "the theoretical background for such an analysis has been presented in ruffini & wilson ( 1975 ) , and damour et al .",
    "the recent discovery of the soft gamma - ray repeater sgr1806 - 20 ( @xcite ) indicates that very high magnetic fields may be present in precollapse stars of a few solar masses .    the calculations by wilson assumed space was filled with a perfect conductor so that the magneto - hydrodynamic model could be used . in the region above a newly formed embh the density is falling rapidly .",
    "eventually , due to the paucity of charge carriers , the assumption of the plasma as a perfect conductor must fail , possibly leading to regions where the electric fields will be sufficiently high so that pair creation will ensue .",
    "similar scenarios can be envisaged for gravitational collapse of much larger masses @xmath8 occurring in galactic nuclei . in the present paper",
    "we begin with the idealized situation of an isolated , reissner - nordstrom embh with charge to mass ratio @xmath1 .",
    "the case of a ker newmann embh is presented in @xcite .",

    "( 1998 ) , ruffini ( 1999a ) , ruffini et al . ( 1999 ) , ruffini ( 1999b ) , and they give the specific initial data of the dyadosphere .",
    "the evolution of the pem pulse formed by the vacuum polarization processes is followed by a numerical calculation to the point where the system is transparent to photons .",
    "we then analyze the final gamma - ray signal that would be observed from this idealized model of an embh in vacuum .",
    "extensions of this model such as the expansion of the pem pulse in the presence of the remnant baryonic matter left over in the collapse process will be the subject of a forthcoming publication@xcite . some consequences for the interpretation of the observed burst and afterglow are presented in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the time of intersection of an expanding ellipse and a fixed shell of radius r as a function of @xmath221 ( i.e. the time at which emission from this intersection circle is received ) is @xmath232 we find that , integrating our boosted planck distribution of photons eq.([jay : e : planck ] ) over frequency , a relativistically expanding shell of radius r and thickness dr will have a time profile ( in ergs / second/@xmath225 ) @xmath233 for @xmath234 , where @xmath235 and @xmath236 is the radiation constant .",
    "thus the larger the radius @xmath222 of the expanding shell at the moment of emission , the broader the @xmath237 tail on the light curve .",
    "the final light curve is then constructed by summing the signal from all shells .    a useful quantity which may be compared with observations is @xmath238 ; the time over which 90% of the emission is received .",
    "the @xmath238 duration for a single shell can be calculated in the relativistic limit ( @xmath228 ) by defining @xmath239 and setting @xmath240 which gives @xmath241 .",
    "so the emission duration in seconds is @xmath242 for @xmath228 .",
    "burst durations are shown in fig.[[figt90 ] ] for a range of embh masses with charge to mass ratio @xmath45 .",
    "preliminary results have been presented in ruffini ( 1999a ) , ruffini et al.(1999 ) and ruffini ( 1999b ) . in the results presented here",
    "we consider a range of black hole masses from @xmath243 to @xmath244 and we assume a charge of @xmath245 @xmath246 . over this mass range , and with this charge , a large amount of energy ( @xmath247 ergs ) is available to be deposited within the dyadosphere , in the form of @xmath9 pairs , due to the process of vacuum polarization ( fig.[[figetot ] ] ) . in fig.[[fig71 ] ] correspondingly the average energy of the created pairs are given as a function of the embh mass .",
    "these energies and spectral distributions are in the range of interest for gamma - ray bursts .",
    "we have analyzed the evolution of this pem pulse by a simple relativistic treatment in flat space for three different cases : 1 ) an expansion with a spatial component of the four velocity proportional to the distance , 2 ) an expansion with a width of the pem pulse constant in the coordinate space and 3 ) an expansion with a width of the pem pulse constant in the comoving frame .",
    "we have then compared and contrasted these results with the general relativistic hydrodynamic calculations . in fig.[[figshells ] ] we see a comparison of the lorentz factor of the expanding fluid as a function of radius for all of the models .",
    "we can see that the one - dimensional code matches the expansion pattern of a shell of constant coordinate thickness .",
    "the astrophysically unprecedented large lorentz factors are reproduced in fig.[[dgamma ] ] as a function of the embh mass .    in fig.[[figarticlepnpnt ] ] and figs.[[figarticleratio],[figalltm ] ] we describe the approach to transparency , as given by eq.([thin ] ) . in fig.[[figarticlepnpnt ] ] we plot the number - densities of pairs @xmath94 given by the rate equation ( [ econtin ] ) and @xmath82 computed from a fermi - integral with zero chemical potential with the temperature @xmath86 determined by the equilibrium condition ( [ eeq ] ) .",
    "it clearly indicates that the pairs @xmath79 fall out of equilibrium as the temperature drops below the threshold of @xmath79-pair annihilation . as a consequence of pair @xmath79-annihilation",
    ", the crossover of this reheating process is shown in fig.[[figarticleratio ] ] .",
    "fig.[[figalltm ] ] illustrates the extreme relativistic nature of the pem pulse expansion : at decoupling , the local comoving plasma temperature is @xmath248 kev , but is boosted by @xmath249 to @xmath250 mev and its relation to the initial energy of the pem pulse in the dyadosphere is presented .",
    "the spectrum and light - curve of the emitted pulse of radiation are analyzed as described in section [ specnltcrv ] .",
    "we see the results for both the hydrodynamic and slab calculations compared in figs.[[denergy ] ] & [ [ figt90 ] ] .",
    "the 1-d hydrodynamic code spectral peak and burst duration @xmath238 are consistently somewhat lower than those of the slab calculations due to gravitational and hydrodynamical effects .",
    "the peak photon energy of the photon number spectrum is in the range of @xmath251 kev , which is consistent with observed gamma - ray bursts .",
    "the duration of the burst is characterized by the @xmath238 time , the time taken to receive @xmath252 of the radiation . over the mass range analyzed ,",
    "@xmath238 is of order a millisecond .",
    "this is shorter than observed gamma - ray bursts ( @xmath253 seconds , see e.g.  @xcite ) , but the collision of the pem pulse with the remnant left over by the process of gravitational collapse produces longer emission times , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated that the concept of an embh in vacuum can produce a gamma - ray burst having many of the general characteristics of observed bursts validating the scenario presented in @xcite .",
    "this simplified model merits further detailed study of the collapse of highly magnetized stars in galaxies ( @xmath254 ) and gravitational collapse process occurring in galactic nuclei ( @xmath255 ) . in particular , it is important to identify how , during the process of gravitational collapse to an embh , the breakdown of the magneto - hydrodynamic conditions leads to the formation of the dyadosphere .",
    "future work will explore some additional important aspects of the pem pulse including ( i ) the presence of baryonic matter left in the remnant around the embh during the process of gravitational collapse and its effect on the relativistic expansion ( @xcite ) , ( ii ) the radiation emitted prior to decoupling and its effect on the dynamics of the pem pulse ( @xcite and @xcite ) , and ( iii ) the emission in the latest stages of evolution of the pem pulse and its comparison with the observed bursts and afterglows in ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
