    ".  is also important for predicting the production rate of 8 and @xmath7be neutrinos in the sun .",
    "accurate knowledge of its rate at solar energies ( @xmath8 kev ) is therefore important for studies of the solar neutrino problems @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical studies of these cross sections have used two closely - related approaches .",
    "potential models  @xcite treat alpha particles and tritons ( or 3 nuclei ",
    "the isospin symmetry of these systems makes the two processes almost identical ) as point particles and the final states as bound states of these point particles .",
    "authors of such models generate wave functions from potentials that fit experimental scattering phase shifts and bound state properties ( binding energies , electromagnetic moments , etc . ) , and then compute the cross section as a direct capture .",
    "the resonating - group method ( rgm )  @xcite is fully microscopic , in that it solves an explicitly seven - body problem with a nucleon - nucleon potential , the parameters of which are adjusted to reproduce bound - state and resonance properties for the particular problem being solved . the name is derived from the choice of basis states for solving the schrdinger equation , which consists of one or more partitions of the particles into clusters with internal harmonic oscillator structure .",
    "the potential models now have a well - founded justification in the resonating - group work , in the form of the microscopic potential model  @xcite .",
    "although the rgm models have apparently been very successful in describing these reactions ( the calculation of kajino @xcite correctly predicted both energy dependence and normalization for the experiment of brune et al .",
    "@xcite ) , it is not clear that this is the final word , because the agreement with the data seems to be spoiled when the model space is expanded @xcite .",
    "it was shown in the early work of christy and duck  @xcite that low - energy radiative captures on light nuclei may be treated to good approximation as external direct captures , that is , as one - step processes in which most of the matrix element arises outside the nuclear interaction radius .",
    "it remains true in more detailed models that the largest contributions to the matrix elements arise in regions well outside the range of the internuclear forces . in principle , then , the cross section energy dependence is given by convolutions of ( positive- and negative - energy ) coulomb wave functions with the current operator , while the normalization of the cross section is determined by the asymptotic normalization of the bound state in the appropriate clusterization channel .",
    "however , fine details are obviously missing from the external direct capture model , motivating application of more detailed models that can predict both energy dependence ( which is relatively easy to measure ) and normalization ( which is not easy to measure , and which must be inserted by hand in an external direct capture calculation after determination by some other means ) .",
    "small effects involving the short - range ( @xmath9 fm ) behavior of the nuclear wave functions , both in the alpha - trinucleon channel and in other channels , can affect the cross sections by several percent .",
    "such effects are probably behind the differences between models pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite . in principle",
    ", there are also small corrections to the leading - order current operators . because of the astrophysical importance of determining these cross sections , and especially the need for low - energy extrapolation of  for solar physics , it is important to apply new approaches to this problem as they become available , and compare the results with past efforts .    in this context , recent developments in the physics of light nuclei",
    "are particularly interesting .",
    "there now exist `` realistic '' nucleon - nucleon potentials which describe the @xmath10 and @xmath11 scattering data , as well as the deuteron , with high precision ( _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "further interactions not describable by two - body potentials are described by three - nucleon potentials , which have been adjusted to reproduce residual effects in the energy spectrum of light nuclei and properties of nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "wave functions have been developed for these potentials in systems with up to eight nucleons  @xcite .",
    "this provides an opportunity to approach the problem of radiative captures on light nuclei using realistic potentials and the computational techniques that have been developed to utilize them .",
    "conversely , astrophysical interest in these processes has resulted in relatively precise measurements , which make cross section calculations useful tests of the wave functions in addition to the reproduction of the static moments , electron scattering properties , and energy spectra to which they have been compared in the past .",
    "we have already reported the application of these wave functions to a radiative capture calculation in a paper on the process  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper describes cross section calculations for the reactions  and , using bound - state wave functions derived from realistic potentials by the variational monte carlo method .",
    "it is organized as follows : in section [ sec : wf ] , we describe the wave functions used to compute the cross sections . in section [ sec : operators ] , we describe the electromagnetic current operators and the methods used to compute their matrix elements . in section [ sec : results ] , we describe the results for cross sections and branching ratios . in section [ sec : conclusion ] , we examine the implications of our results .",

    "the radiative captures can go to either the ground state or the ( bound ) first excited state in both @xmath7li and @xmath7be , so the first excited states of these nuclei were also needed .",

    "we treat all of these models as ( and many have been explicitly constructed as ) descriptions of both the @xmath83 and @xmath156 systems , with appropriate coulomb potentials and laboratory masses .",
    "each of the potentials we use to generate the @xmath155 has a deep , attractive central term , and a spin - orbit term .",
    "the spin - orbit terms are constrained mainly by the spacing between the @xmath157 and @xmath158 bound states , and between the resonances at 2.16 and 4.21 mev in @xmath159 and @xmath160 @xmath161 scattering , respectively ( as well as their analogs in @xmath162 scattering ) .",
    "the other interesting feature in the scattering of the odd partial waves is the apparent hard - sphere behavior of the phase shifts in @xmath113-wave scattering .",
    "this comes about because the wave functions between the clusters must respect the pauli principle by allowing antisymmetrization of nucleon wave functions between clusters . in the @xmath113 waves ,",
    "this takes the form of wave functions that have a single node whose location is almost independent of scattering energy , and it therefore gives rise to phase shifts which look like scattering from a hard sphere @xcite .",

    ", this requires that the central term be large and negative , so that the ground state wave function has one node .",
    "of course , a more tightly - bound `` forbidden '' state with zero nodes exists for such a potential , but it does not allow antisymmetrization of the nucleon wave functions .",
    "we note that the requirement of a particular nodal structure only models approximately the effects of the pauli principle on the inter - cluster correlations .",
    "we did not use potentials that enforced the hard - sphere behavior with repulsive short - range terms @xcite .",

    "the measured @xmath163-wave phase shifts are even worse , being consistent with zero ( or @xmath164 , with the knowledge that there must be at least one node in the wave function ) throughout the region below 8 mev for both @xmath78-t and @xmath78-@xmath165 systems @xcite .",
    "this lack of features is particularly unfortunate in that by far the most important reaction mechanisms for radiative capture in this system are @xmath0 captures from @xmath1- and @xmath163-wave scattering states .",
    "the most stringent tests of any of the @xmath163-wave potentials have been comparison of their phase shifts with the results of more elaborate ( rgm ) theoretical models .",
    "finally , we note the difficulty of reproducing the published models , which is due to omitted descriptions of details of the potentials , particularly handling of the coulomb potential at short range .",
    "rather than guess how to fix up each potential , we restrict attention to potentials that allowed good descriptions of the low - energy scattering on the first try ( with no short - range cutoff in the @xmath166 coulomb term unless explicitly described by the potential s authors ) . relatively small differences in the cluster - cluster potentials are directly connected to the size of the scattering wave function at energies less than 1 mev and cluster separations less than 20 fm , resulting directly in differences in the normalization of our computed capture cross sections from one potential to the next . however , it is possible to eliminate the worst potentials on the basis of the low - energy phase shifts ; potentials which underpredict the phase shifts also produce radiative capture cross sections that are too low by as much as a factor of two , relative to those generated from other cluster - cluster potentials .",
    "potentials which were created for use in orthogonal cluster models ( as opposed to simple cluster models ) were eliminated from application to our problem on this criterion .",

    "all rmes were computed in the standard long - wavelength approximation ( lwa ) , keeping only the lowest - order term in photon wavenumber of the modified spherical bessel functions appearing in the rme integrals .",
    "the lwa is valid to reasonable accuracy because at the low energies under consideration ( @xmath185 mev ) , the ratio of system size to photon wavelength is less than @xmath186 .    in a previous study @xcite , we developed code to examine the isospin - forbidden @xmath0 transition in .",

    "actual computation of the matrix elements was performed with a modified version of the code described in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is itself a modified version of a code developed to compute energies and other properties of light nuclei  @xcite for variational calculations .",
    "the method used to integrate over nucleon configurations is the metropolis monte carlo algorithm , with a weight function proportional to the bound state wave function involved in the computed transition . as discussed below",
    ", this weight function was chosen to reflect in general detail the form of the matrix element integrands , and to obtain significant numbers of monte carlo samples over a broad range of cluster separations .",
    "the final calculation consisted of @xmath189 samples for each transition .    we have applied the approach of splitting the calculation into energy - dependent and energy - independent parts , as in ref .",

    "the final integration over @xmath194 is performed by inserting the appropriate dependences on photon energy in each term ( since the lwa expansion is in powers of energy , this dependence may be taken out of the integral ) , and computing @xmath155 , at each energy . this allows the time - consuming monte carlo integration to be performed only once for each partial wave and operator , so that computation of rmes for many energies is relatively inexpensive in computer time .",
    "after initially setting up the code and checking that selection rules were satisfied , we did not explicitly compute rmes for parity - forbidden operators .    at cluster separations beyond about 10 fm ,",
    "the rme densities were subject to considerable noise in the monte carlo sampling .",
    "this is because while monte carlo weighting schemes based on the ground state give good sampling along directions other than the cluster separation in the @xmath195-dimensional configuration space , they provide small numbers of samples at large @xmath196 ( due to exponential decay of the wave function at large distances ) .",
    "vmc work usually uses weighting based on the inner product in spin - isospin space of a simplified bound state with itself .",
    "such weighting is good for minimizing monte carlo variance of integrands that resemble the bound state probability density closely , such as energies , but it does not provide enough samples in the asymptotic region of the wave function to do low - energy direct capture calculations .",
    "our previous paper @xcite used the square root of the usual weight function , extending the monte carlo sampling out to large cluster separations , but at the expense of greater sampling noise for a fixed number of samples at fixed cluster separation . in the mass - six problem , it was straightforward to run the monte carlo integration of the rmes until the densities had `` converged '' to the expected asymptotic forms at large cluster separation .",
    "this required about @xmath197 total configurations for a given rme . at @xmath25 ,",
    "the spin - isospin space is larger , so the code is slower by a factor of about 10 , and it was only practical to obtain @xmath189 samples for each rme with available computing resources .",
    "however , since the configuration space gains three dimensions with the addition of a particle , @xmath189 samples do not provide as thorough of a sample of the configuration space at mass 7 as at mass 6 .",
    "the result is at best a few - percent measure of the asymptotic normalization at 710 fm .",
    "many samples are obtained at larger cluster separation with the new weighting scheme , but the samples beyond 15 fm appear to have correlated noise .",
    "this is presumably because the samples in question correspond to only a few excursions of the sampling markov chain into the region of large cluster separation , and are therefore not very independent from each other .",
    "they tend to be either mostly high or mostly low relative to the asymptotic forms explicitly built into the wave functions .",
    "see fig . [",
    "fig : anc ] for illustration of these difficulties . a much larger sample ( by a factor of 10 ) would be expected to exhibit much less of this sort of correlated noise , but is prohibited by the large amount of computer time that would require .",
    "the matrix elements were therefore integrated out to 7 fm using the monte carlo results for the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : integrand ] ) ; integration beyond 7 fm was carried out using the known asymptotic forms of the matrix element densities , normalized to the monte carlo output by least - squares fitting at 710 fm .",
    "this range was arrived at by comparing results for the anc of the @xmath7li ground state arising from two different weighting schemes and varying numbers of samples .",
    "reasonably consistent agreement was found by fitting at 710 fm in all cases .",
    "the accuracy in the cross section then depends on how accurately the ancs can be determined in this region .",

    "contributions from higher - order lwa corrections to the @xmath0 operator are less than 0.02% .",

    "the present calculation is the result of sampling @xmath189 points in the seven - particle configuration space .",
    "formal error estimation on the resulting cross sections is difficult because all 35 partitions of the seven nucleons into alpha and triton clusters were computed for each configuration .",
    "this saves computation time , and enforces antisymmetry of the initial state exactly ; it also introduces correlations between values of the operator densities ( integrands of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : integrand ] ) ) at different cluster separations . the uncertainties in different transitions and partial waves",
    "are also correlated , because they are based on the same random walk of particle configurations .",
    "there is also an uncertainty from the wave function normalizations , because they are also derived from monte carlo integrations .",
    "this last uncertainty amounts to about 3% in the cross section .",
    "we take the best indication of the monte carlo uncertainty to be the formal uncertainties on the asymptotic normalizations of the monte carlo matrix element densities , which we used to compute matrix element contributions beyond cluster separations of 7 fm .",

    "the normalizations were fitted to the matrix element densities at cluster separations of 710 fm . using fitted asymptotic forms",
    "amounts to treating a large part of the matrix element as an external direct capture , and it fixes two problems .",

    "second , the asymptotic normalizations are found by a weighted least - squares procedure , and formal error estimates on these normalizations are possible . in practice ,",
    "the correlations between matrix element densities produce reduced @xmath198 significantly less than unity . a common approach when confronted with such a problem in experimental data",
    "is to assume that uncertainties have been overestimated , and to reduce formal uncertainties accordingly .",
    "we have not done this , and we arrive at uncertainties of approximately 10% in the cross section , based on the formal error estimates ( corresponding closely to the sizes of anc errors in table [ tab : anc ] ) .",
    "more detailed analysis is problematic , and it is not called for because the 10% estimate is already larger than any other contribution to the error budget .",

    ", a more likely explanation is that the monte carlo uncertainty has been underestimated , and a ( prohibitively ) long integration would `` converge '' on values in better agreement with experiment .",
    "other aspects of the present calculation which are not done as exactly as one may wish , and therefore may bear on this problem , include the fact that asymptotic forms have been imposed on the wave functions which are inconsistent with their energies , as well as the use of cluster - cluster interactions which were phenomenologically constructed and could conceivably be inconsistent with the rest of the calculation in subtle ways .    despite these lingering difficulties , we have demonstrated the applicability of a new , almost _ ab initio _",
    "approach for computing low - energy radiative captures in cases for which precise measurements exist , achieving the same accuracy as previous theoretical approaches .",
    "we also have presented additional evidence for uncertainty in the logarithmic derivative of the  @xmath1-factor at zero energy .",
    "regarding the present calculation as a first application of realistic potentials to radiative capture at mass seven , it has been successful , and it has taught important lessons about the role of the @xmath65 correlations that were not apparent in previous vmc studies . this work clears the way for more refined models of these radiative captures based on realistic potentials . specific improvements which will be possible in the near future include the use of improved three - body potentials now in development @xcite and the use of essentially exact wave functions derived by the green s function monte carlo technique for the seven - body bound states .",
    "we note that the application of gfmc will require new wave functions , starting from vmc wave functions of the type used here to get the asymptotic forms correct . in the more distant future , it should be possible to perform the whole calculation self - consistently , constructing scattering wave functions from the potentials in a way similar to that used for the bound - state wave functions .",
