    "of electromagnetic waves in transmission through various structures has been of fundamental importance in a great number of applications . through interaction of waves with matter",
    "it is possible to control the wave intensity , polarization and propagation direction .",
    "the simplest devices for wave control , such as optical lenses and mirrors , have evolved into numerous appliances operating with radiation from radiowaves to ultraviolet : fresnel and dielectric lenses @xcite , antenna arrays @xcite , etc .",
    "almost all known structures for wave manipulations perform a particular functionality in the frequency range they operate , while being not transparent and casting a `` shadow '' ( or creating some disturbance ) at other frequencies .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1a ] illustrates such functionality by the example of newton s prism .",
    "the prism designed for light of one color inevitably disturbs the paths of light of other colors . on the other hand , designing structures that manipulate waves only of specific frequencies ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1b ] ) , not interacting with radiation of other frequencies , would enable new exciting opportunities .",
    "in particular , such devices performing different functionalities at different frequencies could be cascaded and even combined in one _ single _ structure ( if its constitutional elements are of several different types ) [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1c ] ] .",
    "+    even arrays of very small and non - resonant elements inevitably reflect and absorb electromagnetic waves , and here we focus on new design solutions which allow minimization of such parasitic interactions everywhere except the desired operational band . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "such frequency - selective control of electromagnetic radiation has been explored only in artificial composites manipulating reflection @xcite and absorption @xcite of incident waves . to complete the full set of functionalities for wave control ,",
    "it is necessary to design a frequency - selective transmitter , i.e. a structure that tailors transmitted fields of incident waves of desired frequencies and passes through the others .",
    "such `` transmitters '' can be integrated into a cascade of different devices independently performing multifunctional multifrequency operations .",
    "obviously , conventional optical and microwave lenses can not take on the role of such a structure .",
    "another candidate could be transmitarray antennas ( also called array lenses ) invented several decades ago @xcite .",
    "they significantly extended our opportunities for wave control , enabling wavefront shaping and beam scanning .",
    "conventional transmitarray antennas incorporate a ground plane with the receiving and transmitting antenna arrays on its sides connected by matched cables . therefore , transmitarray antennas can not pass through the incident radiation at the frequencies beyond their bands , casting a shadow .",
    "recently , there have been considerable interest and progress in manipulation of electromagnetic waves using metamaterials @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the structure represents a composite comprising a two - dimensional array of sub - wavelength elements ( so - called _ metasurface _ ) .",
    "the elements are electrically and magnetically polarizable so that the dipole moments induced in each element form huygens pairs .",
    "therefore , each element does not scatter in the backward direction ( producing zero reflection ) , while it radiates waves with the prescribed phase and amplitude in the forward direction .",
    "the forward scattered waves from the elements together with the incident wave form the transmitted wave .",
    "it should be noted that in all known transmitarray metasurfaces the structural elements constitute reflectionless huygens sources only inside a narrow frequency band . beyond this",
    "band reflections appear because of prevailing excitation of either electric or magnetic dipole .",
    "this is due to the fact that these elements have different frequency dispersions of the electric and magnetic dipole modes ( see @xcite ) .    in order to design a structure that transforms waves but is invisible for the incident radiation outside of the operational band ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1b ] ) , its elements should be designed in such a way that the electric and magnetic dipole moments , induced in them , are balanced ( have equal amplitudes ) at all practically relevant frequencies .",
    "this implies that both dipole responses should be created by excitation of the same resonant mode ( the dipole moments are formed by the same current distribution in the element ) .",
    "such regime is possible only if each element consists of a _ single _ conductive wire or strip @xcite .",
    "these wire elements inevitably possess bianisotropic properties @xcite .",
    "interestingly , being narrowband , the single - wire huygens elements do not produce reflections in a very broad range of frequencies . in the earlier work , such scenario",
    "was realized only for absorbers @xcite , but not for transmitarrays .    in this paper",
    ", we synthesize a uniaxial ( isotropic in its plane ) low - loss reciprocal metasurface that transforms the wavefront of incident waves in a desired manner ( in transmission ) at a desired frequency , remaining transparent in a wide frequency band .",
    "we analyse all possible scenarios of realization of such a metasurface and determine the unique requirement for the electromagnetic response of its elements .",
    "we design and test two synthesized metasurfaces that demonstrate their abilities for wavefront shaping and anomalous refraction . moreover , we propose a promising approach to design multifunctional cascaded metasurfaces that provide different operations at different frequencies ( similarly to the conceptual example in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1c ] ) .",
    "our approach , generally , can be extended to volumetric metamaterials .",
    "we find design solutions for integrated metasurfaces that provide three basic functions such as full control over reflection , absorption and transmission properties .",
    "based on these metasurfaces , one can synthesize arbitrary cascaded composites for general multifunctional wave manipulation .",
    "manipulation of waves transmitted through a thin metasurface can be accomplished due to specifically designed phase gradient over the metasurface plane ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the phase gradient can be achieved by precise adjustment of the phases of transmitted waves from each metasurface inclusion . to adjust the phases for each inclusion , we utilize so - called locally uniform homogenization approach , i.e. we tune an individual inclusion , assuming that it is located in an array with a uniform phase distribution .",
    "an array of such individually adjusted inclusions possesses nearly the required non - uniform phase distribution .",
    "therefore , it is important to design individual inclusions so that uniform arrays formed by them transmit incident waves , conserving its amplitude but changing its phase by a specific value @xmath0 ( different for each inclusion ) that belongs to the interval from 0 to @xmath1 .",
    "next , we examine all possible scenarios of designing metasurface elements that satisfy these conditions .",
    "let us consider a reciprocal metasurface ( the same transmission properties from both sides ) as a two - dimensional periodic array of sub - wavelength bianisotropic inclusions polarizable electrically and magnetically .",
    "the ability of the inclusions to get polarized in the external electric and magnetic fields is described , respectively , by the effective polarizability dyadics @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the transpose operation .",
    "bianisotropy implies that the electric ( magnetic ) field of the incident wave can also produce magnetic ( electric ) polarization in the inclusions .",
    "this effect is often called magnetoelectric coupling and can be characterized by the magnetoelectric polarizability dyadic @xmath5 , which for reciprocal structures is connected with the electromagnetic polarizability as @xmath6 @xcite . considering the uniaxial symmetry of the metasurface ,",
    "it is convenient to represent the polarizability dyadics in the following form : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the transverse unit and vector - product dyadics , respectively , and the indices @xmath10 and @xmath11 refer to the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the corresponding dyadics .",
    "taking into account the reciprocity of the metasurface , equations ( [ eq : uniaxial1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath12    assuming that the incident wave impinges on the uniaxial metasurface normally along the @xmath13-axis , the electric fields of the reflected and transmitted plane waves from the metasurface are given by @xcite @xmath14\\cdot\\mathbf{e}_{\\rm inc } , \\vspace*{.2cm}\\\\ \\displaystyle          \\label{eq : q21}\\ ] ] @xmath15 \\right)\\overline{\\overline{i}}_{\\rm t }    + \\frac{j\\omega}{s } \\widehat{\\alpha}^{\\rm co}_{\\rm em}\\overline{\\overline{j}}_{\\rm t}\\right]\\cdot\\mathbf{e}_{\\rm inc } ,   \\label{eq : q22}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the angular frequency , @xmath17 is the area of the array unit cell , and @xmath18 is the free - space wave impedance .    as discussed in the introduction , to realize broadband reflectionless regime , the metasurface elements must be bianisotropic single - wire inclusions ( see examples in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] ) .    in the literature ,",
    "bianisotropy is usually classified to two classes : chiral class with symmetric electromagnetic dyadic ( @xmath19 ) and omega class , when the dyadic is antisymmetric ( @xmath20 ) @xcite . based on this classification , for the sake of clarity",
    ", we consider this two cases separately .",
    "for a uniform array of single - wire omega inclusions ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2a ] ) the following relation between the effective polarizabilities of each inclusion holds @xcite : @xmath21 substituting @xmath22 from ( [ eq : q3 ] ) in ( [ eq : q21 ] ) , we find the fields of reflected waves from the omega metasurface : @xmath23\\cdot\\mathbf{e}_{\\rm inc}.\\vspace*{.2cm}\\\\ \\displaystyle   \\label{eq : q4}\\ ] ] thus , the condition of zero reflection essential for our transmitarray ( @xmath24 ) implies a limitation on the effective polarizabilitities : @xmath25 this limitation on the effective polarizabilities ( which takes into account interactions between the inclusions ) leads to a corresponding limitation for the individual polarizabilities ( modelling the properties of an individual particle in free space ) @xcite : @xmath26 .",
    "this condition , obviously , can not be satisfied with passive inclusions . indeed , the opposite signs of the electric and magnetic polarizabilities imply that their imaginary parts have the opposite signs .",
    "this scenario corresponds to the case of a passive - active pair of dipole moments .",
    "furthermore , one can see from ( [ eq : q22 ] ) [ assuming @xmath20 ] and ( [ eq : q5 ] ) that in this case the phase of the transmitted wave through the metasurface is always equal to that of the incident wave ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "thus , it is impossible to synthesize a transmitarray with the desired properties using single - wire omega elements .      likewise , effective polarizabilities of chiral single - wire inclusions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2b ] ) in a uniform array are related to one another as follows @xcite : @xmath29 one can see from ( [ eq : q21 ] ) that in the case of a chiral metasurface ( @xmath19 ) , the condition of zero reflection ( @xmath24 ) simply requires the balanced electric and magnetic dipoles @xmath30 of each metasurface inclusion . taking this result into account and combining with relation ( [ eq : q6 ] ) , the transmitted fields through the chiral metasurface ( [ eq : q22 ] )",
    "can be written as @xmath31\\cdot\\mathbf { e}_{\\rm inc } ,      \\label{eq : q10}\\ ] ] where the upper and lower signs correspond to chiral inclusions with the right and left handedness , respectively . from ( [ eq : q10 ] ) it is seen that , generally , the polarization of the wave transmitted through a chiral transmitarray is different from that of the incident wave . in designs of conventional transmitarrays",
    "almost always it is assumed that the polarization of the wave passing through a transmitarray does not change .",
    "however , in many applications polarization - plane rotation of transmitted waves ( in focusing arrays designed for circularly polarized waves , for example ) , is acceptable .",
    "thus , it is important to consider also the case when the transmitarray transforms the incident wave polarization , since if there is no requirement for keeping the polarization constant , there is more design freedom in transmitarrays realizations .",
    "therefore , we look for a solution for the transmitted field in the most general form of elliptical polarization : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the phase difference between the two orthogonal components of the elliptically polarized transmitted field , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the semi - major and semi - minor axes of the polarization ellipse ( real values ) , and @xmath0 is the phase shift between the incident wave ( assumed to be linearly polarized ) and the elliptically polarized transmitted wave .    comparing ( [ eq : q10 ] ) and  ( [ eq : q11 ] ) , we find @xmath36 @xmath37 where symbol @xmath38 denotes the phase angle of the exponential representation of a complex number .    from the energy conservation in lossless metasurfaces",
    "it follows that @xmath39 , which connects the real and imaginary parts of the electric polarizability of each unit cell : @xmath40 using ( [ eq : q14 ] ) , we can rewrite ( [ eq : q12 ] ) and ( [ eq : q13 ] ) as @xmath41 @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    it should be noted that in order to achieve the maximum efficiency , all the elements of the transmitarray must radiate waves of the same polarization , ensuring constructive interference",
    "this implies that the polarization parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 should be equal for all the elements .",
    "therefore , from ( [ eq : q15 ] ) one can see that the imaginary part of the polarizability @xmath44 must be the same for all the elements .",
    "evidently , in this case , from ( [ eq : q16 ] ) we see that the phases of the transmitted waves from each element @xmath0 are equal and can not be adjusted arbitrarily .",
    "this fact forbids designing efficient transmitarrays for wavefront control with single - wire chiral inclusions .      in the previous sections it was shown",
    "that design of a transmitarray which is `` invisible '' beyond its operational band requires the use of bianisotropic single - wire inclusions . on the other hand , it was demonstrated that bianisotropic arrays of single - wire inclusions do not provide full phase control from 0 to @xmath1 .",
    "the only solution to overcome these two contradictory statements is designing a transmitarray whose each unit cell consists of bianisotropic inclusions , being in overall not bianisotropic .",
    "this situation is possible if the bianisotropic effects of the inclusions in a single unit cell are mutually compensated . to realize it",
    ", one can compose a unit cell of inclusions with the opposite ( by sign ) bianisotropy parameters . therefore , there can be two different but equivalent scenarios : a unit cell consists of chiral inclusions with left and right handedness @xcite and a unit cell consists of oppositely oriented omega inclusions @xcite . in both these cases",
    "the bianisotropic effects are completely compensated and the unit cell behaves as a pair of orthogonal electric and magnetic dipoles . however , in contrast to the well known unit cells consisting of a split ring resonator and a continuous wire @xcite , this anisotropic unit cell made of bianisotropic elements is reflectionless and `` invisible '' over a very broad frequency range .",
    "the field expressions ( [ eq : q21 ] ) and ( [ eq : q22 ] ) for the array of single - wire inclusions with compensated bianisotropy we rewrite as @xmath45\\cdot\\mathbf{e}_{\\rm inc } , \\vspace*{.2cm}\\\\ \\displaystyle          \\label{eq : q31}\\ ] ] @xmath46\\cdot\\mathbf{e}_{\\rm inc } , \\label{eq : q32}\\ ] ] where reflection from the metasurface is suppressed , only if the dipole moments of the unit cells are balanced @xmath30 .",
    "assuming that the effective polarizabilities of lossless inclusions in a periodic array can be written as @xcite @xmath47 one can find from ( [ eq : q32 ] ) the fields transmitted through the metasurface : @xmath48\\cdot\\mathbf{e}_{\\rm inc}=e^{\\displaystyle -j \\phi_{\\rm t } } \\cdot\\mathbf{e}_{\\rm inc } , \\label{eq : phase2}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 figure  [ fig : fig3a ] shows the amplitude and phase of the transmitted wave , dictated by ( [ eq : phase2 ] ) and ( [ eq : phase3 ] ) , through a uniform anisotropic array of single - wire inclusions . here",
    "we have assumed that the real part of the individual polarizability of the unit cell has lorentzian dispersion @xmath50 , where and @xmath51 @xmath52 have been chosen to correlate with the numerical results described in the next section .",
    "it is seen that the amplitude of the transmitted wave is identically equal to unity at all frequencies , while its phase spans a full @xmath1 range ( the arctangent function in ( [ eq : phase3 ] ) varies over @xmath53 , therefore , @xmath54 varies over @xmath1 ) .",
    "similar frequency dispersions were explored in @xcite . since in our transmitarray",
    "all the unit cells should operate at the same frequency , the required phase variations can be achieved by adjusting the polarizability @xmath55 according to ( [ eq : phase3 ] ) . the simplest way to control the polarizability strength of the unit cell is to proportionally scale all the sizes of its inclusions . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3a ] , at the resonance ( @xmath56  ghz ) , the phase of transmission is @xmath57 .",
    "if we fix this frequency as the operational one , downscaling all the dimensions of the unit - cell inclusions will result in a phase increase ( from @xmath57 towards 0 ) of the transmitted wave at the operational frequency .",
    "upscaling the inclusions , vice versa , will lead to a phase decrease ( from @xmath57 towards @xmath58 ) .",
    "it is simple to prove that a metasurface possessing only electric dipole response ( @xmath59 ) can not provide full phase variation of transmission .",
    "indeed , in this case reflections from the metasurface inevitably appear @xmath60 and the phase of the transmitted wave @xmath61 spans only the @xmath53 range .",
    "therefore , metasurfaces possessing solely electric dipole response ( commonly called in the literature as single - layer frequency selective surfaces ) can not have 100% efficiency @xcite .    in summary , our analysis shows that broadband reflectionless uniaxial transmitarrays can be realized only with bianisotropic single - wire inclusions whose magnetoelectric coupling is compensated on the level of the unit cell . in this case , the polarization of the transmitted wave is the same as that of the incident one .",
    "importantly , polarization plane rotation is impossible in such transmitarrays .",
    "based on the preceding theoretical analysis , we synthesize transmitarrays from chiral helical inclusions ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2b ] ) , compensating chirality on the level of the unit cell .",
    "alternatively , one could use inclusions with omega electromagnetic coupling . without loss of generality , in this paper we design transmitarrays operating in microwaves on account of peculiarities of the inclusions fabrication .",
    "arrays of helical inclusions operating at infrared frequencies can be manufactured based on fabrication technologies reported in @xcite .",
    "first , it is important to design the unit - cell topology with suppressed chirality . to ensure uniaxial symmetry",
    ", the unit cell should contain helices oriented in two orthogonal directions in the metasurface plane .",
    "we utilize the arrangement of helices proposed in @xcite and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4a ] .",
    "the unit cell includes two blocks of left - handed and two blocks of right - handed helices .",
    "the sub - wavelength size of the inclusions ensures that the unit - cell size @xmath62 is smaller than the operational wavelength .",
    "therefore , the array of such unit cells can be modelled as sheets of homogeneous surface electric and magnetic currents , and the reflected and transmitted plane - wave fields are determined by expressions ( [ eq : q31 ] ) and ( [ eq : q32 ] )",
    ".    figure  [ fig : fig3b ] shows numerically calculated @xcite amplitude and phase of transmission coefficients through an infinite periodic array of the unit cells shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4a ] . the unit - cell dimensions in this example were chosen as follows : @xmath63  mm , @xmath64  mm ( the distance between the center of the block and the center of helices ) .",
    "the helices have the pitch ( the height of one turn ) @xmath65  mm , and the radius of the turn @xmath66  mm .",
    "the radius of the inclusion wire is @xmath67  mm . as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3b ] , the transmittance is more than 88% at all frequencies , while the phase of transmission spans nearly full @xmath1 range from 3.5  ghz to 5.5  ghz .",
    "in contrast to the theoretical results in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig3a ] , in this case transmission is not unity at the resonance due to some dissipation of energy in copper helices .    as it was discussed in the previous section , the phase control of the transmitted waves can be accomplished by proportional scaling the inclusions dimensions .",
    "the phase variation is engineered , for simplicity , only along one direction , along the @xmath68-axis . in our design of transmitarrays with a non - uniform phase distribution",
    "we tune the phase individually for each block of helices ( not the entire unit cell ) to ensure smoother phase gradient over the transmitarray plane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4b ] ) .",
    "although in this case chirality of adjacent in the @xmath68-direction blocks is not completely compensated ( because the helices in the blocks have slightly different sizes and polarizability amplitudes ) , overall , the chirality effect is nearly suppressed due to a great number of different unit cells .    based on the preceding theoretical analysis , we design two transmitarrrays with different functionalities in order to demonstrate the potential of the approach .",
    "these examples show how to manipulate the direction of wave propagation as well as the wavefront shape .",
    "in this example we synthesize a transmitarray that refracts normally incident waves ( along the @xmath13-direction ) at an angle @xmath69 in the @xmath70-plane . to achieve the effect of anomalous refraction",
    ", we need to tune the inclusions dimensions in every block so that there is a linear phase gradient of transmission along the @xmath68-direction of the array .",
    "thus , from the phased arrays theory , the array should be periodical along the @xmath68-direction with the period @xmath71  mm , where @xmath72 is the wavelength at the operational frequency 4.32  ghz . the phase of transmission changes from 0 to @xmath1 along one period @xmath73 .",
    "the periodicity of the array in the @xmath74 direction is @xmath62 ( the period of the unit cell ) , since along this direction there is no phase variation . in order to ensure smooth phase variations",
    ", we place the maximal number of inclusions blocks with prescribed phases along the period @xmath73 . based on the dimensions of the helices ( about @xmath75 ) ,",
    "we form the period of six blocks of helices , i.e. @xmath76  mm . in this example",
    "the spacing between the helices in the blocks @xmath77  mm .",
    "the dimensions of the helices in each block are listed in table  [ tabl : table2 ] in appendix  [ app:1 ] .",
    "the simulated results for the designed transmitarray are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5a ] .    indeed , the structure refracts the incident wave at @xmath69 from the normal . at the operating frequency 4.32  ghz",
    "( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig5b ] ) the transmittance from the structure reaches 83% . non - zero reflection of 5% and absorption of 12% in the transmitarray result from the non - ideal impedance equalization @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the transmitarray passes through more than 95% of the incident power ( without its modification ) beyond its operational band from 4.13 to 4.47  ghz ( see fig .  [",

    "some parasitic reflections from the transmitarray appear .",
    "they are caused by the higher - order resonances in the double - turn helices of the transmitarray and occur near the triple operating frequency at 13.2  ghz @xcite .",
    "at very low frequencies , the transmitarray inclusions are not excited by incident waves and , therefore , are nearly fully transparent .      in order to demonstrate the ability of wavefront shaping",

    "images of chiral inclusions placed between the plates of the waveguide represent equivalent chiral inclusions with the opposite handedness .",

    "this can be explained by two factors .",
    "first , there are some diffraction effects at the edges of the three finite - size metasurfaces .",
    "second , the spectrum separation between the metasurfaces operating at 3.9 and 5  ghz is not high enough .",
    "the metamirror still reflects a small part of the incident energy at 3.9  ghz .",
    "it is seen from table  [ tabl : table1 ] , far from the operating frequencies transmission of incident waves through the metasurface cascade exceeds 84% .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a new type of transmitarrays that allow full wave control ( with the efficiency more than 80% ) and are transparent beyond the operating frequency range . due to the frequency - selective response of the designed transmitarrays",
    ", they can be easily integrated in existing and new complexes of antennas and filters . in this paper , we have also proposed an approach for designing multifunctional cascades of metasurfaces . depending on the frequency of incident radiation ,",
    "such a cascade possesses different responses at different frequencies that can be carefully adjusted . to test the approach , we have designed a cascade of three metasurfaces that performs three different functions for wave control at different frequencies . despite the multifunctional response , the thickness of the designed structure is smaller than the operational wavelength .",
    "unique functionalities of the cascaded metasurfaces could be useful in a variety of new applications .",
    "importantly , going to the limiting case of cascading metasurfaces , one can design a _",
    "metasheet that incorporates different kinds of inclusions performing a multifunctional response .",
    "moreover , our approach of cascaded metasurfaces can be also extended to volumetric metamaterials .    the main challenge for implementing the designed structures are fabrication issues .",
    "however , as we hope to show in our future work , the three - dimensional shape of the helical inclusions can be modified into an appropriate fabrication - friendly printed topology .
