    "nuclear cluster structure in the hoyle state , the second @xmath0 state at @xmath9 mev in @xmath2 , has been discussed for a long time by many authors  @xcite .",
    "cluster model approaches play an important role in understanding the structure and clarified that it has well developed @xmath8 cluster structure with more dilute density than that of saturation in the ground state , where @xmath3 clusters weakly interact with each other in a relative @xmath10-wave  @xcite . in the recent fifteen years , however , the understanding of the hoyle state structure has been much deepened , by an advent of a new type of microscopic cluster model wave function , which is referred to as the tohsaki - horiuchi - schuck - rpke ( thsr ) wave function  @xcite .",
    "this wave function retains a structure that constituent @xmath3 clusters are loosely bound like a gas and occupy an identical orbit , and this structured phenomenon is now called the @xmath3 condensation .",
    "one of the most important properties for the thsr wave function is to give a single and optimal configuration that is equivalent to a solution of full microscopic three - body problem  @xcite . since it is well known that the solutions of the full microscopic three - body problem via @xmath8 resonating group method ( rgm )  @xcite and via generator",
    "coordinate method ( gcm )  @xcite nicely reproduce many experimental data for the hoyle state , like the energy , width , electro - magnetic properties , etc , the equivalence leads to the conclusion that the hoyle state exists as the @xmath3 condensate composed of a weakly interacting and gaslike @xmath8 clusters .    not only the hoyle state but also some other excited states in @xmath2 trigger a special interest in recent years .",
    "for example , the second @xmath11 state was theoretically predicted by the use of the cluster models almost 40 years ago  @xcite , but it was very recently when the existence was confirmed in several experiments  @xcite , with a pioneering work by itoh _",
    "_ as a beginning  @xcite .",
    "besides the second @xmath12 state , a new @xmath13 state is also observed at @xmath14 mev recently  @xcite . the new @xmath12 and @xmath13 states",
    "are now considered to form a rotational family with the hoyle state , though the detailed rotational structure is under question  @xcite . while in ref .",
    "@xcite a simple rotational structure based on a triangular shape of the @xmath8 clusters is assumed , it is pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that this is not simply considered to be an ordinary rotational band that lies on @xmath15 line , due to the @xmath3-condensate nature of the hoyle state , where the third @xmath1 state @xmath16 above the hoyle state also plays an important role .    a new experimental information is also given for the famous broad @xmath1 state observed at @xmath17 mev with a width of @xmath18 mev  @xcite .",
    "_ pointed out that the broad @xmath1 peak is decomposed into two peaks , giving the @xmath6 and @xmath7 states at @xmath19 mev and @xmath20 mev above the @xmath8 threshold , with the widths of @xmath21 mev and @xmath22 mev , respectively  @xcite .",
    "they also found a decay property that the @xmath7 state dominantly decays into @xmath23 while the @xmath6 state decays into @xmath24 .",
    "some theoretical studies consistently reproduce the resonance parameters , where semi - microscopic  @xcite or non - microscopic  @xcite @xmath8 model is adopted . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors applied the complex scaling method ( csm ) and analytic continuation of coupling constant ( accc ) method to the @xmath8 orthogonality condition model ( ocm ) .",
    "they suggested by extrapolation that the @xmath6 state has an @xmath10-wave dominant structure with more dilute density than that of the hoyle state .",
    "the observed decay property and resonance parameters of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 states are also reproduced by the recent calculation by the present author using an extended version of the thsr wave function , where @xmath25 correlation can be taken into account  @xcite .",
    "he further showed more directly by using the thsr wave function that the @xmath6 state is given rise to as a result of the monopole excitation from the hoyle state to have dominantly a higher nodal structure , where the @xmath3 cluster orbits around the @xmath26 in an @xmath10-wave with four nodes .",
    "he also showed that the @xmath7 state has the largest @xmath27-factor in the channel of the @xmath3 cluster coupling with @xmath28 in a @xmath29-wave .",
    "this is consistent with the previous result of the @xmath8 gcm calculation  @xcite , where a large reduced width amplitude ( rwa ) from the @xmath23 channel is obtained , although their calculation fails in reproducing the observed @xmath6 state .",
    "i should also mention that the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) and fermionic molecular dynamics ( fmd ) calculations reproduce the @xmath7 state and predict that the state dominantly has an intrinsic configuration of bent - armed shape of the @xmath8 clusters , like a linear - chain structure that was originally proposed by morinaga  @xcite , although the observed @xmath6 state is also missing in their calculations  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the linear - chain component of the @xmath7 state obtained by the @xmath8 ocm is identified to be @xmath30 configuration in the elliott @xmath31 model , which is calculated to be about @xmath32 % .    in this paper ,",
    "i investigate the excited @xmath0 states obtained in the previous work  @xcite by using the extended thsr wave function and the so - called @xmath5-constraint method  @xcite .",
    "i focus on how much components concentrate on a single configuration of the extended thsr wave function with deformation parameters , and discuss physical natures of the states . in sec .",

    "the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 characterize the size of the constituent @xmath3 particle , and the size and shape of the total nucleus , respectively , though the axial symmetry @xmath47 is assumed throughout this study .",
    "the extended version of the thsr wave function which i utilize in this work is a natural extension of the original form , eq .",
    "( [ eq : thsr ] ) , as follows : @xmath48 , \\label{eq:2 } \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the single parameter @xmath46 is decomposed into @xmath49 and @xmath50 corresponding to the two jacobi coordinates , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is a normalization constant .",
    "this allows us to include @xmath54-type configuration beyond the original thsr wave function , where all @xmath3 clusters are restricted to move in an identical orbit .",
    "this model wave function provides a picture that constituent clusters of a nucleus are trapped into a potential without any geometrical rigid configuration of the clusters under the constraint of antisymmetrization .",
    "the center - of - mass wave functions of the constituent clusters are assumed to have deformable gaussian shapes with widths that are variational parameters and characterize the spatial size and shape of the nucleus .",
    "this is mentioned as a `` container '' picture or non - localized concept of cluster structures in some recent publications ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "not only the gaslike cluster states like the hoyle state @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xmath57 but also ordinary cluster states , which had been believed to have non - gaslike localized cluster structures , such as the inversion doublet band with @xmath58 structure  @xcite , @xmath8 and @xmath59 linear - chain structure  @xcite , @xmath60 structure in @xmath61  @xcite , @xmath62 and @xmath63 structures in @xmath64  @xcite and @xmath65  @xcite , respectively , etc , can all be described by this thsr ansatz with almost @xmath66 % accuracy .    since the excited states above the hoyle state were observed as resonances with non - negligible widths , it is more likely that the bound state approximation does not work well for those states .",
    "i therefore use a technique to effectively eliminate continuum components that get mixed with the resonances , so - called @xmath5-constraint method , which is also used in refs .",
    "@xcite and the effectiveness is already guaranteed . in this technique , by considering the fact that in calculations of bound states , pseudo continuum states are shown to have large root mean square ( r.m.s . )",
    "radii , compared to those of resonances and bound states , one can remove effectively the spurious continuum components in the following way : first i solve the following equation , @xmath67 with @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the angular - momentum projection operator onto @xmath71 . the eigenstates in eq .",

    "the r.m.s .",
    "radius of the @xmath6 state is the largest of the @xmath1 states and the much stronger monopole transition strength between the @xmath33 and @xmath6 states , than that between the @xmath33 and @xmath80 state ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , can be seen .",
    "these indicate , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the @xmath6 state is excited by monopole transition from the hoyle state to have a higher nodal structure between @xmath56 and @xmath3 cluster .    as i mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , i adopted volkov no .",

    "however , i confirmed that qualitative features of these states that will be discussed in this section , such as the behaviours of squared overlaps , do not change at all .",

    "all the states obtained in his calculations are derived as solutions of the hill - wheeler equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : wf ] ) , where many bases of thsr - type configurations are superposed",
    ". this will , however , make it unclear how the thsr picture mentioned above is realized for those states , since the superposition of the thsr configurations might break its original picture .",
    "thus , in order to investigate how the thsr picture holds for the @xmath1 states , i calculate the following two quantities : @xmath93 and @xmath94 the former is the squared overlap of the @xmath33 @xmath95 , @xmath6 @xmath96 and @xmath7 @xmath97 states in eq .",

    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows the contour map in two parameter space @xmath87 .",

    "one can also find that the region denoted by dotted curve in red , where the squared overlap is more than @xmath115 , is widely ranged from prolately @xmath116 to oblately @xmath117 deformed shapes , passing through the spherical one @xmath118 , with large @xmath119 values .",
    "this supports the idea that the hoyle state does not have any definite intrinsic shape but have a gaslike configuration of the @xmath8 particles .",
    "i should also note that the projection operator @xmath120 , which removes the ground state component with compact structure , plays a role as a repulsive force to prevent the @xmath8 clusters from being resolved and to form well developed @xmath8 cluster structure for the hoyle state , due to its orthogonality condition .",

    "i also check the squared overlap in the model space of @xmath133 , i.e. @xmath134 in four parameter space , but no large squared overlap more than 0.19 can be obtained .    however , this situation changes drastically when i consider the thsr model space of its single configuration that is orthogonal to the hoyle state as well as to the ground state , i.e. @xmath135 , where the projection operator is defined as @xmath136 . then in fig .",

    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "this is of course due to the effect of the orthogonalization operator @xmath140 .",
    "these results clearly indicate that in order to describe the @xmath6 state , the orthogonalization to the hoyle state as well as to the ground state is the most essential .",
    "this implies that the @xmath6 state is intimately related to the hoyle state , like its family .",

    "the physical properties of the states , relationship with the hoyle state , and similarities and differences between them were discussed by calculating the squared overlap with the single configurations of the extended thsr wave function .",
    "the @xmath6 state was found to appear as a result of the orthogonalization to the hoyle state as well as to the ground state , so that the strong monopole transition or vibrational transition is induced .",
    "the state is considered to be a family of the hoyle state with a higher nodal structure in internal motions of the @xmath8 clusters .",
    "the @xmath7 state was shown to have a linear - chain structure as a dominant configuration , where the @xmath8 clusters move rather freely in a much elongated way along the @xmath159-axis , i.e. like a one - dimensional gas , though the density distribution shows a localized @xmath8 linear - chain structure , due to the inter-@xmath3 pauli repulsion . besides the linear - chain configuration",
    ", some other correlations like a bending mode also seem to be mixed .",
