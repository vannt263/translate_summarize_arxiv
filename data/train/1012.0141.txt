    "the large single transverse - spin asymmetry ( ssa ) observed in the inclusive single - hadron production , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 etc . ) , at rhic@xcite plays a crucial role to reveal the multiparton correlations inside the nucleon . in the region of the large transverse momentum of the final hadron , @xmath5 ,",
    "the ssa is described as a twist-3 observable in the collinear factorization , connecting the ssa to the multiparton correlations directly @xcite . in principle , multiparton correlations causing the ssa in @xmath3 exist both in the initial - state proton and the final - state hadron . since the analytic formula for the latter effect is not available , we shall focus in this work on the effect of the quark - gluon correlations in the transversely polarized proton and see how the existing data are described by those effects . in the transversely polarized nucleon",
    ", there are two independent twist-3 quark - gluon correlation functions , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which are defined from the light - cone correlation function in the nucleon @xmath8 , with @xmath9 being the quark field and @xmath10 the gluon s field strength .",
    "( for the explicit definition of the correlation functions and their property , see @xcite . ) the variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote , respectively , the longitudinal momentum fractions of the quarks and the gluon coming out of the nucleon . in the twist-3 mechanism ,",
    "the complex phase necessary for ssa is supplied as a pole contribution from an internal propagator in the hard part .",
    "these poles are classified into the soft - gluon - pole ( sgp ) and soft - fermion - pole ( sfp ) , corresponding , respectively , to @xmath13 ( @xmath14 or 2 ) and @xmath15 .",
    "accordingly , the single - spin - dependent cross section can be represented as @xmath16 where the first and the second term represents , respectively , the sgp and the sfp contributions , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the unpolarized parton distribution and the fragmentation functions .",
    "@xcite derived @xmath19 in ( [ formula ] ) and performed a numerical analysis of the existing @xmath0 data .",
    "for the sgp contribution , see @xcite .",
    "] they obtained a reasonable description of the rhic data except for the positive asymmetry for the @xmath2 production and the @xmath1-dependence .",
    "one of the present authors derived the formula for @xmath20@xcite and found @xmath21 in the relevant channels , showing a potential importance of the sfp contribution . in our recent paper@xcite",
    ", we have analyzed the rhic @xmath0 data based on the formula ( [ formula ] ) including both sgp and sfp contributions .",
    "we found that the inclusion of the sfp contribution gives a better description of the data and that the sfp contribution can not be replaced by the readjustment of the sgp contribution .",
    "this is the first numerical analysis showing the importance of the sfp effect .",
    "this talk provides a short summary of the analysis and some new plots not shown in @xcite .",
    "for the fitting , we have assumed the following functional form for the sgp and sfp functions , @xmath22 where the subscript @xmath23 denote the light - quark flavor , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the parameters to be determined by the fitting . for simplicity , the scale dependence of each twist-3 functions are assumed to be the same as the unpolarized quark distribution function @xmath27 in the right - hand - side . in our fitting , we have included the rhic data by the star@xcite ( @xmath28 gev ) and the brahms@xcite ( @xmath29 gev ) collaborations .",
    "we did not use the fnal data ( @xmath30 gev ) , since the nlo qcd in the collinear factorization fails to reproduce the unpolarized cross section at the fixed target energy .    under this assumption",
    ", we have performed three types of fitting in order to see the importance of the sfp effect .",
    "fit 1 includes both sgp and sfp contributions .",
    "fit 2 omit the sfp contribution from fit 1 with the same degrees of freedom as fit 1 for the sgp contribution .",
    "fit 3 includes only the sgp contribution but with more degrees of freedom for the parameters . for the fits",
    ", we used the grv98 @xcite parton distribution and the dss fragmentation functions for @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the obtained results are shown in fig .",
    "[ result ] together with the rhic data .",
    "for comparison we also showed the result by kouvaris _",
    "et al . _ ( fit ii of @xcite ) .",
    "one sees that fit 1 and fit 3 give good agreement with the data , while fit 2 fails to reproduce @xmath0 for @xmath2 production .",
    "this feature is reflected in the values of @xmath33 , which are @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 for fit 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "although fit 3 reproduce the data , some of the obtained sgp functions in fit 3 show an unphysical behavior , which causes large @xmath0 for @xmath31 in the small @xmath37 region at the fnal energy . from these facts ,",
    "we regard our fit 1 as the best fit for the rhic @xmath0 data .",
    "2 shows the sgp and sfp functions for each quark flavor in fit 1 .",
    "one sees from the figure that the sgp and the sfp functions have similar magnitude , but the sgp functions spreads more in the larger @xmath38 region , which plays an important role for the rising @xmath0 at large @xmath37 . among the sfp functions , those for the @xmath39 and @xmath40 quarks are larger and have longer range than those for other flavors",
    ".      another interesting feature of @xmath0 is its dependence on the transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) of the final hadron .",
    "[ pt ] shows the calculated @xmath1-dependence of @xmath0 for @xmath42 together with the star data ( left figure ) and that in the wider range of @xmath1 for fit 1 ( right figure ) .",
    "all three fits reproduce the @xmath1-dependence of the data .",
    "this is quite natural since our fit used the corresponding @xmath1 values for each data point shown in fig . 1 , and thus the @xmath1-dependence shown in fig . [ pt ]",
    "is partly taken into account . at larger @xmath1",
    ", @xmath0 starts decreasing but not as fast as @xmath43 .",
    "this is because two effects of @xmath44 and @xmath45 coexist in @xmath0 reflecting its twist-3 nature , which leads to rather flat @xmath1-behavior at moderate values of @xmath37 . at @xmath46",
    ", @xmath0 stays zero in the whole @xmath1 region which is consistent with the phenix data@xcite .      by separating the calculated @xmath0 into the sgp and the sfp contributions",
    ", we found that a major contribution comes from the former effect .",
    "however , the sfp contribution also brings a large contribution at @xmath47 which cancels the sgp contribution , making @xmath0 small in this region . for @xmath2 and @xmath48 , we found a significant contribution from the sfp effect . for the detail ,",
    "see fig . 4 in @xcite .    to see more detail of fit 1",
    ", we have shown in fig .",
    "[ fd ] the decomposition of @xmath0 at @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 into each quark - flavor of the quark - gluon correlation functions . as is seen from the figure , the dominant contribution comes from the sgp effect for the valence flavor .",
    "however , for @xmath51 , the sfp effect from @xmath39- and @xmath40-quark flavors is also significant .",
    "this is because of the corresponding large sfp functions ( see fig .",
    "2 ) and the large partonic hard cross section in the gluon - fragmentation channel combined with the large gluon component for @xmath32 in the dss fragmentation function . for the pion , this sfp effect in the gluon - fragmentation channel is canceled by the quark contributions , making the net sfp effect small .",
    "@xmath52    @xmath48    @xmath53    @xmath2    [ cols=\"^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this work we have presented a new analysis of the rhic @xmath0 data for @xmath31 and @xmath32 based on the twist-3 mechanism , including the complete contributions from the quark - gluon correlation functions in the transversely polarized nucleon .",
    "we have found that the sgp contribution alone is insufficient and the inclusion of the sfp contribution is crucial to reproduce all the reported rhic data .",
    "the sgp and the sfp functions determined in our analysis can be used to predict the ssa in other processes such as the direct - photon production and drell - yan process at rhic , and semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering at eic energy , and should be tested by confrontation with experimental data . in our present study , other twist-3 effects , i.e. , the three - gluon correlations in the transversely polarized proton and the contribution from the twist-3 fragmentation function , have not been taken into account . for a complete clarification of the origin of ssa",
    ", these effects should also be investigated by looking at wider variety of experimental data in the future study ."
