    "spintronics is a new and intensively developing field of physics , which attracts significant scientific interest from both fundamental and application points of view ( see , e.g. , refs .  [ ] and the references therein ) .",
    "the main objective of spintronics is search for new materials for devices of future generation ( like , for instance , spin transistors , quantum computing devices , solar cells , etc . ) and with fundamentally new operation principles in comparison to traditional devices based on the electron charge transport .",
    "@xcite@xmath0 @xcite one of the main problems , which still require solution , concerns effective control of spin polarization and spin injection in spintronics devices .",
    "@xcite@xmath0 @xcite this problem triggered an extensive theoretical and experimental search for new materials and devices , like metallic systems consisting of ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic layers or tunnel junctions including ferromagnetic and diluted magnetic ( non - magnetic ) semiconductors . @xcite@xmath0 @xcite significant progress has been made recently in the technology and physics of doped semiconductors with spontaneous spin polarization , and in the spin injection from magnetic to non - magnetic systems .",
    "@xcite@xmath0@xcite several theoretical models have been also proposed to describe doping - induced ferromagnetism and spin injection.@xcite    theoretical studies carried out to date usually treated the spin subsystem by techniques developed for equilibrium situations .",
    "however , such an approach applied to the spin - transport phenomena ignores the fact that both spin polarization and spin injection are dynamical processes and therefore should be treated by methods of non - equilibrium thermodynamics.@xcite@xmath0@xcite this is particularly important for open dynamical systems that are able to exchange particles and energy with the environment ( which is true for the spin subsystem considered here ) .",
    "the dynamical processes may lead to stationary non - equilibrium states with high ordering level .",
    "such cooperative phenomena in the system of magnetic ions and mobile band electrons can take place far from an equilibrium state .",
    "generally , the system can have several stationary solutions described by the same set of nonlinear time - dependent differential equations , which are different regarding their stability against small fluctuations .",
    "in the case of stable solution , fluctuations are suppressed within a short period of time .",
    "if a solution is unstable , fluctuations can be amplified and the system may be switched to another stable state .",
    "the new state may have the same or even higher ordering level , when it is described with a lower symmetry group .",
    "such spontaneous switching between different possible states is known as a self - organization of the system .",
    "the methodology based on non - equilibrium thermodynamics , developed for investigating self - organization processes , offers promising approach to such spintronics problems like spin polarization and spin injection .",
    "this may lead to new quantitative and even qualitative results , which are not accessible within the traditional approaches .",
    "the problem studied in this paper concerns the dynamics of a single - domain magnetic system interacting with a spin current flowing through it ",
    "the problem already investigated in detail by sun @xcite using the standard methods .",
    "the approach based on the self - organization techniques yields some new interesting results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model is described in section 2 , where the symmetry of a quasi - one - dimensional ferromagnet @xcite is analyzed in detail .",
    "analytical solutions corresponding to four equilibrium and two independent stationary states are also derived there .",
    "the stability analysis regarding the influence of small perturbations shows that the spatial angles describing the magnetization vector can vary either monotonically or in an oscillatory manner with time , depending in a complex way on the system parameters .",
    "section 3 presents the results of our numerical calculations and the relevant discussion .",
    "this section is split into two subsections in order to separate the analysis of equilibrium and stationary states from the analysis of the time evolution of the system .",
    "we also discuss the magnetization switching and its dependence on the magnetic field and spin current .",
    "it is shown that the equilibrium and stationary states are characterized by a different dynamics of the oscillatory modes which can be excited by small perturbations of the phase variables .",
    "the bifurcation points of the system ( the points where the system changes its behavior qualitatively ) are also determined , and their dependence on the external parameters is investigated .",
    "the second subsection presents the results obtained from the numerical simulations .",
    "a significant attention is paid to the analysis of the system evolution through several types of different magnetization precession modes .",
    "it is shown that the system can be switched between different equilibrium states , @xmath1 , in a controllable way , which is of particular interest for the spintronics applications .",
    "the detailed analysis of the system evolution has been performed using the self - organization methodology ; namely , the density histogram of the longitudinal magnetization component , power spectral density , hausdorff dimension , maximum lyapunov exponent , and the phase trajectory tracing curve .",
    "this allowed us to clarify peculiarities of the magnetization orientation for different values of the applied magnetic field .",
    "the derived analytical expressions for the magnetic switching between the states @xmath1 made it possible to analyze the dependence of the switching time on the external magnetic field and the spin current .",
    "the last section 4 includes the summary and main conclusions .",
    "we consider a model system studied recently by sun .",

( [ inseq59 ] ) ) was already investigated in detail,@xcite where it was used for determination of the threshold field @xmath364 for the switching from parallel to antiparallel @xmath75 state , we will consider below only the switching peculiarities defined by eq .",
    "( [ inseq60 ] ) .    in figs . 13 and 14",
    "we present the time and field dependence of @xmath75 and @xmath365 , calculated according to eqs .",
    "( [ inseq60 ] ) and ( [ inseq57 ] ) , respectively . the dashed areas in fig .",
    "13 correspond to @xmath354 values obtained by the numerical integration of the system using the runge - kutta method .",
    "as one can see , for different values of @xmath48 , @xmath354 determined from eq .",
    "( [ inseq60 ] ) forms the outline of numerically calculated magnetization vector projection .",
    "it is worth noting that the good correlation between the analytical and numerical results can be also observed for the function @xmath366 for different values of spin current @xmath49 ( fig .",
    "the latter proves that the proposed simplification of initial equations ( [ eq4 ] ) , ( [ eq5 ] ) , and ( [ eq12 ] ) by averaging over @xmath56 is correct . the dashed curves in figs .",

    "( [ inseq57 ] ) and ( [ inseq60 ] ) .",
    "our analysis has shown that these curves can be approximated well with the gaussian distribution.@xcite the values @xmath367 corresponding to the minimum of @xmath368 , can be found by solving the cubic equation @xmath369 which can have one or three real solutions , of which only those satisfying the condition @xmath370 should be taken into account .    as follows from fig .",
    "13 , at the fixed values of @xmath49 , @xmath144 and @xmath40 , the minimum value of @xmath371 decreases exponentially with time , while the similar minimum of @xmath372 at fixed @xmath306 , @xmath144 , and @xmath40 grows linearly with the increase of @xmath49 ( fig .",
    "it is important to emphasize that in the latter case the value of applied magnetic field , at which @xmath75 turns to zero , decreases linearly with increasing @xmath49 .    as one can see from figs .",
    "13 and 14 , the switching time between the ground states @xmath309 and @xmath373 has the same order of magnitude as the half - width of the @xmath374 peak .",
    "this half - width remains practically unchanged with @xmath48 at the fixed @xmath306 , @xmath144 , and @xmath40 ( fig .",

    "it is worth noting that for the fixed applied magnetic field @xmath48 , the increase of @xmath49 leads to decrease of the switching time @xmath307 .",

    "the results presented in fig .",

    ", the applied magnetic field has the stabilizing action , leading to a decrease of @xmath307 .",
    "it is also worth to emphasize that for @xmath380 , the influence of the applied magnetic field becomes dominant compared to the role of the spin current @xmath49 .",
    "it is worth noting that formulas ( [ inseq60 ] ) and ( [ inseq61 ] ) allow to obtain analytical expressions for the parameters ( [ inseq62 ] ) , making it possible to investigate in detail the dependence of the switching time @xmath307 on @xmath381 , and @xmath40 .",
