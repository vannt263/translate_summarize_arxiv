    "this contribution is small and not so easily distinguishable here , but was observed more clearly in a similar resonator @xcite .",
    "we tentatively attribute this contribution to phonon - fluctuations .",
    "the fourth contribution is a bump around the resonator response time frequency ( 27 khz ) .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that this phenomenon is consistent with mixing of frequency noise into the amplitude direction , due to a difference in the probe frequency and the resonant frequency of the resonator during the noise measurement .",
