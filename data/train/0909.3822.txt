    "benford s law ( bl ) asserts that in certain sets of numbers , most of them of real - life origin , the first digit is distributed non - uniformly in the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the first digit of the number and @xmath7 is the logarithm base 10 .",
    "in other words , @xmath8 is the fraction of the numbers with first digit @xmath6 in the given set .",
    "there are also forms of benford s law for second , third , etc .",
    ", digits , namely @xmath9 .",
    "table 1 shows the values of @xmath8 for @xmath10 .",
    ".first digit benford law .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     bl has been found to be obeyed quite well in a variety of situations , many of them checked by franck benford himself@xcite .",
    "these sets include population census , stock markets indeces , utilities bills , tax returns , areas of rivers , physical and mathematical constants , and molecular weights , among others@xcite . at first sight ,",
    "the law is certainly baffling and counterintuitive@xcite since one s naive intuition is that digits of numbers should be uniformly or randomly distributed .",
    "although franck benford has been credited with the law for his work of 1938@xcite , the law was originally discovered by the astronomer simon newcomb in 1881@xcite as a follow up of the observation that the pages of tables of logarithms in his university library were worn out following bl , as given by equation ( [ bl ] ) .",
    "what is rarely told is that newcomb _ derived",
    "_ benford s law .",
    "his demonstration for us may now look obscure , and probably just sketchy , because he used arguments that were not so difficult to those familiar with concepts of log tables ... and certainly we are not .",
    "we shall advance a plausible explanation of newcomb s observation of the worn pages of the log tables and argue why many sets of real - life origin also obey bl ; alas , this argument was also used by newcomb .",
    "we shall first prove a general result that appears to be known already@xcite , although to the best of our knowledge it has not been shown explicitely in the form here presented ; we shall see that yields exactly all digit s benford s distributions , allowing also for concluding that it is scale and number base invariant@xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that if @xmath2 is a set of real numbers uniformly distributed , then , the distributions of digits of @xmath11 obey bl for any real positive number @xmath1 .",
    "then , we discuss the main result of newcomb , namely , the fact that a given set of numbers obeys bl if the mantissas of their logarithms are uniformly distributed .",
    "we then analyze two main type of sequences of numbers that obey bl , those that are obtained from multiplication of numbers drawn from any distribution and those that are part of a geometric progression of numbers uniformly distributed in an arbitrary interval .",
    "let @xmath12 be a sequence of real numbers drawn from a uniform distribution in the interval @xmath13 , with @xmath4 any integer .",
    "then , the first , second , ... , digit distributions of the sequence @xmath14 , with @xmath1 any real positive number , approaches benford s law , eq.([bl ] ) and its generalizations , as @xmath15 .",
    "let us look first at the first digit distribution . in fig .",
    "[ gr-2 ] we plot @xmath11 vs @xmath2 in a semi - log ( base @xmath1 ) scale . in this graph , @xmath11 vs @xmath2 appears as a straight line . now take in the @xmath2-axis the sequence @xmath12 within the interval @xmath16 .",
    "take any number of the sequence , say @xmath17 .",
    "then , in the logarithmic scale , @xmath18 must lie within any of the following  bins \" : @xmath19 , the interval @xmath20 ; or @xmath21 , the interval @xmath22 ; @xmath23 ; or , @xmath24 , the interval @xmath25 .",
    "the main point is this : if @xmath26 lies within the bin @xmath27 , then the first digit of @xmath28 is @xmath6 .     vs @xmath2 in semi - log scale .",
    "the dotted line shows an example of an arbitrary point @xmath17 in the chosen interval , such that the first digit of @xmath28 is 2 because it falls in bin @xmath21.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    since @xmath17 was drawn from a uniform distribution , it has the same chance to take any value within the interval @xmath3 and , therefore , the probability of @xmath29 to fall within the bin @xmath27 is the length of the bin @xmath27 divided by the length of the full interval , namely @xmath30 & = & \\frac{\\log_{a } \\left((d + 1 ) \\times 10^p \\right ) - \\log_{a } \\left(d \\times 10^p \\right)}{\\log_{a } \\left(10^{p+1 } \\right ) - \\log_{a } \\left(10^p \\right ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac { \\log_{a } \\left(\\frac{1 + d}{d } \\right)}{\\log_{a } 10 } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\log_{10 } \\left ( 1 + \\frac{1}{d } \\right ) .\\label{bl1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this has the form of benford s law for the first digit @xmath8 , eq .",
    "( [ bl ] ) . thus , as @xmath15 , the first digit distribution of the sequence @xmath14 will approach @xmath8",
    ". we shall call this the _ general result _ ( gr ) .",
    "note that gr is independent of the integer value of @xmath4 of the interval as long as the sequence is uniformly distributed .",
    "clearly , the result holds if we change the interval to @xmath31 with @xmath32 any integer .",
    "note that we never used the fact that neither @xmath1 , nor @xmath2 , nor @xmath6 , are numbers base 10 ; the graph in fig .",
    "[ gr-2 ] is plotted for numbers base 10 for illustration purposes , but the result would have been the same for any number base .",
    "thus , we conclude that bl is base invariant , i.e. valid for any number base @xmath33 , with @xmath34 .",
    "the second , third , ... , digit distributions follow right away with the same argument .",
    "for instance , the probability that the second digit of @xmath28 is @xmath6 , equals the sum of the lenghts of the  sub - bins \" , @xmath35 where @xmath6 can now take all values @xmath36 .",
    "thus , the second digit distribution is , @xmath37 \\nonumber \\\\ & = &   \\frac{1}{\\log_{a } \\left(10^{p+1 } \\right ) - \\log_{a } \\left(10^p \\right ) } \\sum_{m=1}^9    \\log_{a}\\frac { 10 m + d + 1}{10 m + d }   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sum_{m=1}^9   \\log_{10 } \\left ( 1 + \\frac { 1}{10 m + d } \\right ) .",
    "\\label{bl2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the argument is easily generalized to the @xmath38-th digit and the result is , @xmath39    the present derivation is extremely simple .",
    "although newcomb never wrote the formulas for @xmath9 , given his mastery of log tables and numerical analysis@xcite , it is clear that he knew them since he writes the values of @xmath8 and @xmath40 explicitely and mentions how @xmath41 and @xmath42 behave ( the latter are almost uniform ) . due to newcomb",
    "s most important result , as we discuss in the next section , it seems to the author that he knew a derivation very similar to this one .",
    "benford s law and its generalizations have been rigorously shown by hill@xcite to follow as a consequence of base invariance of the underlying law .",
    "we have no pretense of such a mathematical rigour here , but rather to show its simplicity to a wider audience .",
    "a very important property of bl that follows from gr above is the fact that bl is scale invariant@xcite .",
    "add to the values @xmath17 any constant value @xmath43 .",
    "this is equivalent to consider a uniform sequence of numbers @xmath17 in the interval @xmath44 . referring to fig .",
    "[ gr-2 ] one can see that in the semi - log graph this also amounts to shift the interval in the ordinate by a constant amount , @xmath45 ; one also sees , however , that the sizes of the bins @xmath46 remain unchanged .",
    "thus , the sequence @xmath47 also obeys bl . but this new sequence is the same as the original one @xmath14 multiplied by a constant , arbitrary , factor @xmath45 .",
    "the sequences or sets of numbers that usually follow bl are not of the form @xmath48 .",
    "so , one can enquiry for a rule that tells us if some sequences do follow bl or not .",
    "the answer was also given by newcomb in his two - page paper@xcite .",
    "we shall demonstrate now that for a given sequence of numbers @xmath49 , if the mantissas of the logarithms of @xmath50 , namely of @xmath51 , are uniformly distributed , then the sequence @xmath49 obeys bl .",
    "before we give the demonstration , we note that gr can be restated much simpler for the case @xmath52 , namely , if a sequence of numbers @xmath17 are uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath53 , the sequence @xmath54 follows bl .",
    "we use this form below .",
    "the demonstration can be done writing the log of @xmath50 as , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is an integer , the so - called _ characteristic _ of the log , and @xmath57 the fractional part of the logarithm or _",
    "mantissa_. note that by definition the mantissas of logarithms base 10 are within the interval @xmath53 .",
    "it is clear , then , that when taking the  antilogarithm \" @xmath58 the digits of @xmath50 will be determined only by @xmath59 since the factor @xmath60 just determines the position of the decimal point .",
    "thus , the distribution of digits is determined by considering the sequence of the mantissas only , namely of the sequence @xmath61 .",
    "hence , if the latter are uniformly distributed , by gr the sequence @xmath62 obeys bl and , therefore , so does the sequence @xmath49 .",
    "this result is very useful since allows us to check if a sequence of numbers obeys bl by looking at the distribution of the mantissas of their logarithms .",
    "this is a simple operational rule , instead of a logical one by checking at the digits themselves .",
    "the next question is which type of sequences or sets of numbers follow bl .",
    "answering this in an exhaustive fashion appears as a difficult task . here",
    ", we discuss two general type of sequences that can be shown quite clearly that obey bl . with these two",
    ", we shall conjecture about the general case .",
    "we discuss these cases below .",
    "consider the set of numbers @xmath63 , with @xmath64 given by the product of @xmath32 numbers , @xmath65 where @xmath2 are the absolute values of numbers drawn from an _ arbitrary _ distribution ( up to a requirement to be given below ) .",
    "we now show that in the limit @xmath15 and @xmath66 , the sequence @xmath63 obeys bl .",
    "the idea is to use the mantissa rule . for this",
    ", we consider the log base 10 of the numbers @xmath64 , @xmath67 we now introduce the requirement that the _ distribution of the logarithms _ of the numbers @xmath2 have finite first and second moments .",
    "then , in the limit @xmath66 , by the central limit theorem ( clt)@xcite , the distribution of @xmath68 is the normal distribution .",
    "that is , the values of @xmath68 are distributed as , @xmath69 note that this is not the log - normal distribution , but simply the normal distribution for the variable @xmath68 .",
    "the centroid @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the first and second moments of the distribution of the _ logarithms _ of the numbers @xmath2 .",
    "this point will be further discussed below .",
    "we proceed to show that the mantissas of the sequence @xmath74 are uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath53 , in the limits mentioned .",
    "before we give the general condition , we can see the how this limit is achieved .",
    "assume that the gaussian function given by eq.([gauss ] ) is already wide enough such that it covers several orders of magnitude , or `` decades '' , of the values of @xmath75 ; see fig .",
    "[ gaus ] where the decades are denoted by @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "the mantissas of the @xmath68 are the decimal values within the intervals @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "thus , we can `` shift '' all intervals within all decades to a single interval , thus placing the mantissas within the same interval . adding all the values of the mantissas yields , almost , a uniform distribution .",
    "this procedure is the same as considering the sum of an infinite number of gaussians each centered at @xmath82 with @xmath4 taking all the integer values ; in the limit @xmath66 , equivalent to @xmath83 , one gets the exact result , @xmath84 this proves that the mantissas are uniformly distributed in the limit , for logarithms normally distributed . although the previous result is strictly valid only in the limit @xmath83 , the convergence is extremely fast .",
    "for instance , for @xmath85 , the sum differs from 1 in the eighth significant figure .",
    "one finds strong deviations from the uniform distribution as @xmath86 becomes much smaller than 1 , that is , when the gaussian covers less than one decade .    , covering 5 decades approximately .",
    "second panel , the mantissas of the normal distribution within one decade , i.e. in the interval @xmath53 ; the dotted line is the sum of only 5 decades , adding to 1 within 3 significant figures . ]    , covering 5 decades approximately .",
    "second panel , the mantissas of the normal distribution within one decade , i.e. in the interval @xmath53 ; the dotted line is the sum of only 5 decades , adding to 1 within 3 significant figures . ]    on the other hand , since @xmath86 depends not only on @xmath32 but also on the second moment @xmath73 of the distribution of logarithms of @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath71 , the convergence might be very slow if the width , or support , of the distribution of @xmath2 itself is very narrow .",
    "as particular examples , considering @xmath2 taken from a uniform distribution in the interval @xmath87 , requires @xmath32 to be less than 10 ( about 4 or 5 ) to converge to bl .",
    "conversely , for @xmath2 in the interval @xmath88 takes @xmath89 to yield bl .",
    "the result of this section , namely of the product of numbers obeying bl , is very robust and general@xcite in the sense that even if the distribution of the numbers @xmath2 lack second moment , the logarithm of @xmath2 may not@xcite .",
    "this is because the logarithm function is very `` slow '' and tends to smooth the original distribution . moreover , even if the numbers @xmath2 are correlated , the action of the logarithm and the limit of very large products ( i.e. large values of @xmath32 ) may again yield a normal distribution of the logarithms@xcite .",
    "here we consider a geometric sequence of products of the form , @xmath90 where @xmath91 are numbers uniformly distributed in an arbitrary interval @xmath92 $ ] , with @xmath1 and @xmath93 real positive numbers .",
    "this sequence obeys bl .",
    "although this result may be generalized to arbitrary distributions , we restrict the results here to uniform distributions .",
    "we note that if @xmath94 , the above sequence is a true geometric progression with ratio @xmath1 .",
    "thus , geometric progressions also obey bl ( except if @xmath95 with @xmath96 any integer ) .",
    "again , we first consider the sequence of the logarithms of the products , @xmath97 . since we do not have an analytic demonstration , we resort to a numerical one . in fig .",
    "[ geofig ] a particular example shows that the distribution of @xmath97 becomes uniformly distributed as @xmath98 .",
    "as this distribution covers many decades of @xmath99 , obviously the mantissas of @xmath97 also become uniform in @xmath53 . a numerical comparison with bl",
    "is also included .",

    "second panel shows that the distribution of mantissas is uniform in @xmath53 .",

    "the third panel is a comparison of the exact benford law ( circles ) with the distribution of the first digit of the 10,000 terms considered ( triangles ) . ]      from the above two cases , it appears that a generalization is as follows : as long as the distribution of logarithms is wide enough , namely , covering many decades of the set considered , the mantissa distribution will tend to become uniformly distributed .",
    "an analogous argument was recently used by fewster@xcite to illustrate when benford s law should be obeyed .",
    "simon newcomb initiates his article by pointing out that the log tables were worn out more at the beginning than at the end , i.e. following bl .",
    "that is , since the tables are for logarithms of numbers going in order from @xmath102 to @xmath103 , he found that the pages for numbers starting with 1 were more used than those for numbers starting with 2 , etc .",
    "newcomb gave an explanation of these observation by assuming that  natural \" numbers , i.e. those appearing in nature , were obtained by ratios of other numbers .",
    "then , he argued that no matter the underlying law of the primitive numbers , their ratios ( in the limit of many ratios ) had the mantissas of their logarithms uniformly distributed .",
    "he then simply stated that this implied benford law . as we have seen , the mantissa rule is equivalent to gr .",
    "it is fairly evident that newcomb certainly knew this result , and thus , that he must be credited with the derivation of bl .",
    "we mention , once more , that the arguments given in this article are essentially contained in newcomb s original paper .",
    "an interesting aspect is why newcomb considered that ",
    "natural \" numbers were the result of ratios , or products for that matter , of other numbers . in the light of the previous sections and a bit of second - guessing , we can advance an explanation for this assertion by newcomb .",
    "moreover , this may also well be the explanation for the agreement of actual real - life data with bl .    to begin , we should recall why log tables were used in the first place .",
    "we are well into the era of electronic calculators , be it a pocket - size one or a huge supercomputer : numerical calculations are now their task not ours .",
    "but as recently as the early 1970 s , not to mention in the xix century , numerical calculations were done by hand and/or sliding rules . and the log tables were essential to realize those tedious and lengthy tasks .",
    "as a matter of fact , logarithms were invented ( or discovered ? ) by john napier in 1614 to perform lengthy calculations ! in the words of napier himself@xcite ,    _ seeing there is nothing that is so troublesome to mathematical practice , nor that doth more molest and hinder calculations , than the multiplications , divisions , square and cubic extractions of great numbers .",
    "... i began therefore to consider in my mind by what certain and ready art i might remove those hindrances . _ - john napier , _ mirifici logarithmorum canonis descriptio _ ( 1614 ) .",
    "that is , the trouble appears when one must make calculations by hand , specially multiplications , of numbers with _ many _ digits .",
    "it is lengthy , tedious and prone to produce mistakes .",
    "thus , one goes to the tables to find out the logarithms of the numbers involved , performs sums and subtractions which are much easier , and then taking antilogarithms the result is found .",
    "the point is , where did those _",
    "long _ numbers come from ? those were definitely not made up , neither read out from somewhere else , nor measured .",
    "the long numbers came themselves from _ multiplication , divisions or powers _ of smaller numbers .",
    "the latter may be random , or measured or taken arbitrarily from somewhere else , indeed .",
    "but , we insist , the long numbers did arise from operations performed on smaller numbers . as we have seen in the previous section , multiplication of numbers tipically",
    "tend to bl , even if only few factors are involved , as long as they arise from wide distributions .",
    "in other words , the numbers that people looked their logarithms for , typically , obeyed already bl . since in the xix century numbers were not churned out from a computer but arised from arithmetic operations performed by real people , it seems to the author that for newcomb these were  naturally \" produced .",
    "this may also explain why many sets of real - life data obey bl , that is , unless one asks a computer for a random number , numbers that quantify a property , be it the area of a lake or the weight of a molecule , usually arise from arithmetic operations performed on measured quantities with arbitrary constants and units .",
    "the present article does not pretend to give an exhaustive list of references on bl .",
    "the articles by raimi@xcite and fewster@xcite give a good account of several rigorous and not - so rigorous works .",
    "as mentioned in the text , the general result ( gr ) of section ii appears to be known to many researchers .",
    "one can study the case where @xmath17 is taken from a lorentzian distribution , that lacks second moment .",
    "one finds that the distribution of logarithms of @xmath17 do have a second moment , thus yielding a normal distribution for the logarithms of products of @xmath17 .",
    "we have verified that the product of the so - called unfolded eigenvalues of random matrices of the gaussian unitary ensemble@xcite also obey bl ; we note that every set of eigenvalues of those matrices is highly correlated .",
    "we thank carlos pineda and jorge flores for providing the numerical data to perform this test ."
