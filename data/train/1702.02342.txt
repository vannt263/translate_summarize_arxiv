    "by an action of a group @xmath7 on a surface @xmath8 we understand an embedding of @xmath7 into the group @xmath9 of homeomorphisms of @xmath8 . two such actions are _ topologically conjugate _ , or of the same _ topological type _ , if the images of @xmath7 are conjugate in @xmath9 .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that , except for a few cases , the order @xmath0 of the finite cyclic group @xmath10 acting on a closed orientable topological surface @xmath1 of genus @xmath2 determines the topological type of the action , provided that @xmath3 . in @xcite the first author et al .",
    "undertook a more general problem of topological classification of such actions for @xmath4 .",
    "this is an essential extension , because between @xmath11 and @xmath12 only @xmath13 and @xmath14 can stand as the period of a single self - homeomorphism of @xmath1 , whereas there are infinitely many rational values of @xmath15 such that for @xmath16 we have @xmath17 and @xmath0 is the period of a self - homeomorphisms of @xmath1 for infinitely many @xmath18 .",
    "in @xcite we considered analogous problem for cyclic actions generated by an orientation reversing self - homeomorphism , while in @xcite - a similar problem for closed non - orientable surfaces , obtaining a classification of topological types of action of @xmath10 on a surface @xmath8 in function of a possible type of the quotient orbifold @xmath19 , provided that @xmath0 is sufficiently big .",
    "the present paper , in which we deal with topological classification of actions of @xmath10 on a bordered surface of algebraic genus @xmath6 , where @xmath5 , completes our project of topological classification of big cyclic actions on compact surfaces .",
    "the lower bound @xmath20 for the order of an action is essential for two reasons .",
    "the first is that we again cover a quite large class of actions , since there are infinitely many rational values of @xmath15 , for which there are infinitely many values of @xmath6 , such that a bordered surface of algebraic genus @xmath6 admits a cyclic action of order @xmath21 and @xmath5 .",
    "the second reason for the bound @xmath5 is that it is satisfied for all the actions realising the solutions of the so called minimum genus and maximum order problems for bordered surfaces found in @xcite , and the question about their topological rigidity partially motivated the present paper .",
    "there are two more interesting features of the actions considered in this paper .",
    "the first is that finite group actions on compact surfaces of negative euler characteristic may be realised by analytic actions on riemann surfaces , or dianalytic actions on klein surfaces , due to the hurwitz - nielsen , kerkjarto and alling - greenleaf geometrizations mentioned in subsection [ geometrization ] .",
    "the loci in the moduli spaces of klein surfaces composed of the points classifying the surfaces dianalitically realizing the actions considered here have dimensions @xmath22 or @xmath23 ( this follows from lemma [ big o - r ] , formula ( [ can - fuchs ] ) and classical formula of fricke and klein for dimension of teichmller spaces of fuchsian groups c.f .",
    "theorem 0.3.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "this is similar as in the case of actions on unbordered non - orientable klein surfaces @xcite , or orientation reversing automorphisms of classical riemann surfaces @xcite , but in contrast to the classical case of orientation - preserving cyclic actions of order @xmath24 described in @xcite , where the loci of such structures in the moduli space are @xmath25-dimensional , which means , in particular , that the topological type of an action of an orientation - preserving self - homeomorphism of such order usually uniquely determines the conformal type of a riemann surface on which it acts as an automorphism . finally , observe that our results can be stated in terms of birational actions on real algebraic curves due to the functorial equivalence between bordered klein surfaces and such curves described in @xcite",
    "suppose that a cyclic group of order @xmath0 acts on a bordered surface @xmath8 of algebraic genus @xmath6 , where @xmath5 .",
    "we show in section [ sec : types ] that the orbit space @xmath26 is one of the following orbifolds :    * disc with @xmath27 corner points , * annulus with @xmath28 corner points , * mbius band with @xmath28 corner points , * @xmath29-punctured disc with @xmath28 corner points , * @xmath29-punctured disc with @xmath30 corner points , * @xmath29-punctured mbius band , * @xmath28-punctured disc , * @xmath29-punctured annulus , * @xmath23-punctured disc , * @xmath28-punctured disc with @xmath28 corner points .",

    "their proofs are given in section [ sec : main ] which is also divided in ten subsections with the same titles for the reader s convenience . throughout the whole paper @xmath31 will denote the euler totient function .",
