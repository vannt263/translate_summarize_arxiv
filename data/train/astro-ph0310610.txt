    "the higher order gravity theory has important contribution in the early universe .",
    "the importance of fourth order gravity in the gravitational action was explored by several authors .",
    "starobinsky @xcite first presented a solution of the inflationary scenario without invoking phase transition in the early universe considering only geometric term in the field equations . in this direction , hawking and luttrel @xcite shown the curvature square term in the action mimicks as a massive scalar field .",
    "further , starobinsky and schmidt @xcite have shown that the inflationary phase is an attractor in the neighbourhood of the solution of the fourth order gravity theory .",
    "low energy effective action corresponding to brane world cosmology also contains higher curvature invariant terms .    to elucidate the effect of the fourth order gravity theory in the early universe one needs more ( exact ) solutions of the field equations .",
    "the solutions of the classical fourth order gravity theory are very few due to non - linearity of the field equations .",
    "the field equations obtained from the action can be simplified by introducing an auxiliary variable following the prescription of boulware et al @xcite .    in some recent papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite the minisuperspace quantization of fourth order gravity introducing auxiliary variable",
    "have been presented , whose canonical quantization yields schrodinger like equation with a meaningful definition of quantum mechanical probability .",
    "further , the extremization of the effective potential leads to the vacuum einstein equation .",
    "the choice of auxiliary variable is the turning point in simplifying the field equations and it yields a transparent and simple quantum mechanical equation .",
    "with such a successful choice of auxiliary variable it is extremly necessary to study the solution of the classical field equations .",
    "the field equations with the auxiliary variable are quite complicated and require special attention for solution .",
    "we introduce noether symmetry to the fourth order gravity theory in the frw background as simplifying assumption instead of any adhoc assumption , or any equation of state for solution of the classical field equations .",
    "we consider the einstein - hilbert action with a curvature squared term and a non - minimally coupled scalar field . applying the nother symmetry in the above action following the noether symmetry approach of de - rities et al @xcite it is possible to extract a class of solutions .",
    "it is interesting to note that the introduction of noether symmetry in the action of higher order gravity theory not only gives noether symmetry but it also leads explicit time dependence of the scale factor ( as well as the scalar field ) as a consequence of noether symmetry .",
    "we now move on to extract noether symmetry of the theory .",
    "it was earlier attempted by capozziello @xcite , where he introduced the higher order term in the action as a constraint , through lagrange multiplier .",
