    "the hough transform is a well known pattern recognition technique to detect features in images when specified in some parametric form  @xcite .",
    "the classical hough transform is most commonly used for the detection of simple curves such as straight lines , circles , ellipses  @xcite . however , in recent papers its effectiveness has been proved in the case of more complex classes of curves , specifically , families of irreducible algebraic plane curves like elliptic curves , conchoids of slse , oblique bifolium , curves with 3 convexities , wassenaar curves , quartic curves with a tacnode , and piriform curves  @xcite .",
    "some of these curves have been successfully applied for identifying profiles of interest on ct slices of the human skeleton , including lumbar vertebrae and the spinal canal at different heights of the vertebral column  @xcite .    the basic idea to perform this identification is that points on a curve in the image space are mapped into curves ( more generally hypersurfaces ) in a parameter space which intersect at a uniquely determined point .",
    "the coordinates of this intersection point identify the curve in the image space .",
    "the procedure that computationally realizes this identification is based on a discretization of the parameter space and on the definition of an accumulator matrix counting for the number of points mapped into curves passing through ( i.e. , voting ) its cells .",
    "the set of parameters corresponding to the maximum in the accumulator allows the recognition of the desired curve in the image space .    from a mathematical viewpoint ,",
    "the use of the hough transform to recognize curves of more complexity in an image requires to prove the duality type result that associates a unique point in the parameter space to many different points on a curve in the image space  @xcite . from a computational viewpoint ,",
    "the number of parameters in the curve equation defines the dimension of the parameter space .",
    "thus , the computational effort of the voting procedure accordingly increases as the dimension of the accumulator matrix .",
    "further , more practically , many recognition tasks in real applications require the identification of profiles that can not be associated to a single curve but are more realistically represented by piecewise defined curves . for example , the identification of bone profiles in the human skeleton requires a method to assign an appropriate piece of curve to a specific portion of the real skeleton profile .",
    "therefore , an approximation of the whole district shape can be obtained by using an iterative approach to hough transform in order to iteratively approximate different parts of the same bone profile with different curves .    in order to realize such a procedure",
    ", one can eliminate those points in the profile that have been recognized by using the hough transform according to a specific family of curves , and re - applying the method by searching for a different curve from the family using the remaining set of points . however , this procedure is computationally expensive and therefore in this paper we introduced a _ layered accumulator matrix _ that allowed us to discard the contribution of some points in the voting procedure without re - voting .",
    "this way , we reached the twofold objective of iteratively approximating the entire profile with a piecewise defined curve without dramatically increasing the computational cost of the algorithm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ ht ]",
    "we recall some theoretical results  @xcite on the hough transform of algebraic curves .",
    "we also prove that , for the family of curves in the form used in the presented application , the requested conditions for the uniqueness of the intersection point in the parameter space are verified . in section  [ piecewise ]",
    "we define the layered accumulator and we present the recognition algorithm according to this new accumulator definition . in section 4",
    "we present some numerical results considering the recognition of a lumbar vertebra in a x - ray ct image .",
    "finally , in section 5 our conclusions are offered .",
    "this section surveys some definitions and basic facts introduced in @xcite and @xcite , to which refer for more details and examples .",
    "although these results hold over an infinite integral ring @xmath0 , having in mind applications to imaging , we assume @xmath1 .",
    "we introduce a family of irreducible polynomials @xmath2 where the coefficients @xmath3 are polynomials in the independent parameters @xmath4 varying in an euclidean open set @xmath5 , and with the degree , @xmath6 , of @xmath7 not depending on @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 be the corresponding family of zero loci @xmath10 of @xmath7 and assume that each @xmath10 is a curve in the affine plane @xmath11 .",
    "so we want a family @xmath12 of irreducible curves which share the degree .",
    "if @xmath13 is a point in the image space @xmath11 , the polynomial @xmath14 defines a hypersurface in the parameter space @xmath15 , where  @xmath16 are affine indeterminates .",
    "we say that this hypersurface is the _ hough transform @xmath17 of the point @xmath18 with respect to the family _ @xmath19 .    in ( * ?",
    "* theorem 2.2 ) it is proved that , given a family @xmath20 of irreducible curves defined as above , the hough transforms @xmath17 , when @xmath18 varies on a curve @xmath10 , all pass through the same point @xmath8 and , if there exists another point @xmath21 where the hough transforms @xmath17 intersect , then @xmath22 . moreover , the following two conditions are equivalent .    1 .   for any pair of curves @xmath10 and @xmath23 in @xmath9 , the equality @xmath22 implies @xmath24 .",
    "2 .   for each curve @xmath10 in @xmath9 ,",
    "one has @xmath25 .",
    "a family @xmath20 of curves which meets one of the above equivalent conditions is said _",
    "hough regular_. the curves of those families share the same property of the straight lines as in the original definition of the hough transform ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore hough regularity has a crucial computational role in the solution of the pattern recognition problem since for a hough regular family of curves it is possible to formulate a computationally effective generalization of the algorithm for line detection , able to automatically extract in the image a profile described by the curves from the family .",
    "clearly , the above equivalent properties are not true in general .",
    "for example , for the family of conics of equation @xmath26 we have that @xmath27 .",
    "it is therefore of special interest to find hough regular families of curves .",
    "to this aim , we observe that , if @xmath28 are the equations of @xmath10 and @xmath23 respectively , then @xmath29 reads @xmath30 for some @xmath31 , that is , @xmath32 for each pair of indices @xmath33 , @xmath34 ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1 , p. 365 ) ) .",
    "relations ( [ car ] ) can be used to check the hough regularity of the family , i.e. , that @xmath35 implies @xmath36 .    in the following example",
    "we describe the family of curves we deal with throughout the paper .",
    "[ elliptic ] consider the family @xmath19 of unbounded cubic curves of equation @xmath37 for some real parameters @xmath38 , with @xmath39 .",
    "non - singular curves from the family are elliptic curves , that is , of genus @xmath40 .",
    "equation ( [ ell1 ] ) is a slight modification of the so called _ weierstrass form _ , and allows us to better pattern after a vertebra profile .",
    "let us show that the family is hough regular .",
    "assuming @xmath41 , equation ( [ car ] ) reads @xmath42 the second , third and fourth relations clearly give @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "then @xmath45 by the last relation .",
    "thus the first one yields @xmath46 .",
    "for any point @xmath13 in the image plane @xmath11 , the hough transform of the point @xmath18 with respect to @xmath47 is the quartic hypersurface in the parameter space @xmath48 of equation @xmath49",
    "let @xmath50 , @xmath51 , be the set of points of interest in the image space , and let @xmath52 be their hough transforms in the parameter space @xmath53 .",
    "the first step of the standard recognition algorithm is based on a discretization of a subset @xmath54 of the parameter space , i.e. , on the definition of a set of cells @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a point in @xmath54 , @xmath57 is a sampling point , @xmath58 is a multi - index identifying both a specific cell and the corresponding sampling point , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the sampling distance and the number of samples considered along the @xmath61-component , respectively . following the standard approach , the _ accumulator matrix _",
    "@xmath62 is then defined as @xmath63 and it is usually computed by means of the iterative process @xmath64 with initialization @xmath65 and final result @xmath66 , for each @xmath67 .",
    "the search for the maximum of @xmath68 at position @xmath69 allows us to identify the set of parameters @xmath70 and finally the curve @xmath71 best approximating the set of points @xmath50 in the image .",
    "this approach can be effectively applied to the recognition of significant profiles in medical and astronomical images  @xcite . however , in practical applications , a better accuracy can be achieved by approximating the profile of interest using more than one curve , each one fitting a specific portion of the profile .    a possible approach is based on the search of successive maxima in the accumulator matrix , starting from the absolute one and moving on in descending order , up to a fixed threshold .",
    "this scheme has the main drawback that local maxima often cluster in the same region of the parameter space , thus identifying curves characterized by very similar sets of parameters , well approximating the same subsets of points in the same portion of the profile .",
    "we propose here an alternative approach based on the principle _ one man one vote _",
    ", i.e. , each point in the dataset is allowed voting for just one curve .",
    "once a curve has been recognized , all the points voting for it have to be removed from the dataset and the computation of the accumulator matrix has to be repeated without their contribution . in order to realize this idea without increasing the computational effort associated to the computation of the process defined by ( [ accumulator - matrix ] )",
    ", we introduce a _ layered accumulator matrix _ @xmath72 , where the @xmath34-th layer is a binary matrix containing the votes of the @xmath34-th point @xmath50 of the original dataset to the whole set of cells .",
    "that is , @xmath73    by definition @xmath74 is then set to @xmath40 if and only if the hough transform @xmath52 of the point @xmath50 passes across the cell @xmath75 .",
    "the usual accumulator @xmath68 can be easily computed from @xmath76 summing over all the layers : @xmath77 then a first curve @xmath71 can be recognized in the usual way . however , the main advantage of this re - formulation is that one can easily identify the points which voted for the cell @xmath78 by looking for the non - zero entries @xmath79 , and then remove the corresponding layers from @xmath76 . calling @xmath80 the whole set of values the index",
    "@xmath34 can assume in the original dataset , and @xmath81 the subset containing the indices of the removed layers , we can re - compute the usual accumulator @xmath68 without the contribution of points @xmath50 , @xmath82 , and without re - voting , by simply computing @xmath83        \\(a ) ( b )    a new curve can now be recognized through optimization of the updated accumulator matrix , and so on . the iterative approach inspired by previous considerations",
    "is summarized in algorithm  [ alg : the_alg ] . a pictorial representation of the layered accumulator @xmath76 is shown in fig .  [ fig : example_a ] ( where we refer to the case @xmath84 , so that @xmath76 is a @xmath85-dimensional matrix ) .",

    "for example , at each iteration we check whether the points removed from the dataset ( i.e. , already approximated ) lie in connected components .",
