    "the @xmath10 orbitals are directed along the @xmath8 axis and exhibit a nonbonding character in the high - temperature phase .",
    "furthermore , in the high - temperature phase , the @xmath11 orbitals mix with the o 2@xmath13 orbitals , leading to a upward energy shift that results in their overlapping the energy of the @xmath3 orbitals .",
    "the monoclinic distortion in the low - temperature phase causes the @xmath3 orbitals to split into bonding and antibonding orbitals and the @xmath11 orbitals to split off from the lower @xmath3 orbitals because of the strong @xmath14 bonding that results from the short v - o distance .",
    "however , the role of v - v pairing versus electron correlations for the splitting of the @xmath3 orbitals remains open to debate.@xcite    recent experimental results have revealed a contribution of electron correlations to the mit in vo@xmath0 .",

    "thin films of vo@xmath0 have been shown to experience substrate strain , which decreases the band - gap energy in the low - temperature insulating phase.@xcite this result suggests that the nanostructures can be used to investigate the role of lattice distortion and v - v pairing in determining the spectrum of electronic states in vo@xmath0 .",
    "highly crystalline metal - oxide nanoparticles can be fabricated by grinding with a planetary ball mill.@xcite for vo@xmath0 nanoparticles , the monoclinic distortion is expected to be affected by surface or finite - size effects , so it is important to elucidate the properties of vo@xmath0 nanoparticles .",
    "therefore , we present herein a systematic investigation of the crystal and electronic structure and the magnetic properties above and below the mit for ball - milled vo@xmath0 nanoparticles and for vo@xmath0 microparticles , the latter of which are used as a reference sample . by performing a rietveld analysis of synchrotron radiation x - ray diffraction ( sr - xrd ) measurements , we find an elongation and a reduction in the tilting of the v - v pair in the low - temperature monoclinic phase .",
    "in addition , o @xmath1 xas and v @xmath2 resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) measurements of the nanoparticles reveal that both the @xmath11 and the bonding @xmath10 state move to @xmath9 . finally , we show that the change in the lattice distortion is consistent with the change in the electronic states around @xmath9 , which suggests that the peierls mechanism contributes to the energy splitting of the @xmath3 state .",

    "although it is possible that isolated v@xmath5 atoms exist near the surface , the ratio of v surface atoms to the total number of atoms is approximately 3% for 18-nm - diameter nanoparticles,@xcite which is equivalent to the average crystallite size in the nano sample .",

    "the magnetic - susceptibility anomaly for the nano sample also appears in the width of the hysteresis .",
    "the increase in the width of the hysteresis should be elucidated within the framework of classical nucleation theory , as was done in earlier work using nanoparticles buried in silica.@xcite      we have investigated the crystal and electronic structure and the magnetic properties of the vo@xmath0 bulk and nano samples , and we find significant differences in the properties of the two samples in the low - temperature phases .",
    "the low - temperature phase of the nano sample involves the formation of elongated and less - tilted v - v pairs , a narrowed energy gap , and an induced paramagnetic contribution .",
    "the o @xmath1 xas of the low - temperature phase shows that the @xmath11 state of the lowest unoccupied state redshifts by approximately 0.1 ev for the nano sample relative to the bulk sample , which suggests that the @xmath49 bonding between the @xmath11 orbitals and the o 2@xmath41 orbitals becomes weak for the nano sample .",
    "a qualitatively consistent result from the structural refinements is that the shortest v - o distance increases by about 3% for the nano sample , as shown in table ii .",
    "furthermore , using the solid state table of harrison@xcite shows that the energy splitting due to the @xmath49 bonding decreases by about 0.25 ev for the nano sample relative to the bulk sample.@xcite the half of the estimated value is found to agree with the redshift observed in the o @xmath1 xas .    for the low - temperature phase",
    ", the combination of the results of v @xmath2 rixs and o @xmath1 xas indicates that the bonding @xmath3 state of the highest occupied state blueshifts by approximately 0.2 ev for the nano sample .",
    "if the system follows the peierls model,@xcite the energy splitting of the @xmath3 orbital should be proportional to the displacement along the @xmath8 axis that results from the formation of the v - v pair . the extent of the displacement is roughly determined by @xmath50 , where @xmath51 denotes the monoclinic @xmath26 axis ( corresponding approximately to 2@xmath8 ) and @xmath52 denotes the v - v bond length . as a result , we find that , with respect to the values listed in tables i and ii , the displacement decreases by approximately 10% for the nano sample .",
    "the @xmath3 splitting for the bulk sample is about 2.5 ev , which is equivalent to the results for single vo@xmath0 crystals.@xcite assuming that electron - lattice interactions remain unchanged , we conclude that the @xmath3 splitting decreases by about 0.25 ev for the nano sample , which is comparable to the shift of the bonding @xmath3 state observed in the nano sample .",
    "this result suggests that the @xmath3 splitting follows the peierls model .",
    "however , because recent experimental results show the crucial role of electron correlations in driving the mit , @xcite we interpret our results as indicating that the mit is attributed to both effects ; namely a correlation - assisted peierls transition.@xcite    the nano sample mainly consists of sphere - like nanoparticles , as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , which we attribute to the minimization of surface energy . maintaining such a highly symmetric shape should require the suppression of lattice distortion , which could be attributed to the formation of the elongated and less - tilted v - v pairs for the nano sample . in this case , controlling the particle size allows us to obtain further information , such as the relationship between the lattice distortion , the energy gap , and the paramagnetic contribution in the low - temperature phase .",
    "we observe the formation of an elongated and less - tilted v - v pair , a narrowed energy gap , and an induced paramagnetic contribution in the low - temperature phase of vo@xmath0 nanoparticles by performing a rietveld analysis of sr - xrd data , o @xmath1 xas , v @xmath2 rixs , and magnetic susceptibility measurements .",

    "the high - temperature rutile structure of the vo@xmath0 nanoparticles is almost identical to the structure of the vo@xmath0 microparticles , which exhibit bulk - like behavior .",
