    "we are in the midst of a remarkable outpouring of results from the cmb that has seen major announcements in each of the last three years , with no sign of abatement in the pace as more experiments are scheduled to release analyses of their results .",
    "this paper is an update of @xcite to take into account how the new data have improved the case for primordial acceleration , and for acceleration occurring now .",
    "the simplest inflation models are strongly preferred by the data .",
    "this does not mean inflation is proved , it just fits the available information better than ever .",
    "it also does not mean that competitor theories are ruled out , but they would have to look awfully like inflation for them to work . as a result",
    "many competitors have now fallen into extreme disfavour as the data have improved .    *",
    "the cmb spectrum : * the cmb is a nearly perfect blackbody of @xmath14 @xcite , with a @xmath15 dipole associated with the 300 @xmath16 flow of the earth in the cmb , and a rich pattern of higher multipole anisotropies at tens of @xmath17k arising from fluctuations at photon decoupling and later .",
    "spectral distortions from the blackbody have been detected in the cobe firas and dirbe data .",
    "these are associated with starbursting galaxies due to stellar and accretion disk radiation downshifted into the infrared by dust then redshifted into the submillimetre ; they have energy about twice all that in optical light , about a tenth of a percent of that in the cmb .",
    "the spectrally well - defined sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) distortion associated with compton - upscattering of cmb photons from hot gas has not been observed in the spectrum .",
    "the firas 95% cl upper limit of @xmath18 of the energy in the cmb is compatible with the @xmath19 expected from clusters , groups and filaments in structure formation models , and places strong constraints on the allowed amount of earlier energy injection , ruling out mostly hydrodynamic models of lss .",
    "the sz effect has been well observed at high resolution with very high signal - to - noise along lines - of - sight through dozens of clusters .",
    "the sz effect in random fields may have been observed with the cbi and bima , again at high resolution , although multifrequency observations to differentiate the signal from the cmb primary and radio source contributions will be needed to show this .    *",
    "the era of upper limits : * the story of the experimental quest for spatial anisotropies in the cmb temperature is a heroic one .",
    "the original 1965 penzias and wilson discovery paper quoted angular anisotropies below @xmath20 , but by the late sixties @xmath21 limits were reached , by partridge and wilkinson and by conklin and bracewell . as calculations of baryon - dominated adiabatic and isocurvature models improved in the 70s and early 80s , the theoretical expectation was that the experimentalists just had to get to @xmath22 , as they did , boynton and partridge in 73 .",
    "the only signal found was the dipole , hinted at by conklin and bracewell in 73 , but found definitively in berkeley and princeton balloon experiments in the late 70s , along with upper limits on the quadrupole . throughout the 1980s , the upper limits kept coming down , punctuated by a few experiments widely used by theorists to constrain models : the small angle 84 uson and wilkinson and 87 ovro limits , the large angle 81 melchiorri limit , early ( 87 ) limits from the large angle tenerife experiment , the small angle ratan-600 limits , the @xmath23-beam relict-1 satellite limit of 87 , and lubin and meinhold s 89 half - degree south pole limit , marking a first assault on the peak .",
    "primordial fluctuations from which structure would have grown in the universe can be one of two modes : adiabatic scalar perturbations associated with gravitational curvature variations or isocurvature scalar perturbations , with no initial curvature variation , but variations in the relative amounts of matter of different types , in the number of photons per baryon , or per dark matter particle , in the entropy per particle .",
    "both modes could be present at once , and in addition there may also be tensor perturbations associated with primordial gravitational radiation which can leave an imprint on the cmb .",
    "the statistical distribution of the primordial fluctuations determines the statistics of the radiation pattern ; the distribution could be generically non - gaussian , needing an infinity of n - point correlation functions to characterize it .",
    "the special case when only the 3d 2-point correlation function is needed is that of a gaussian random field ; if dependent upon spatial separations only , not absolute positions or orientations , it is homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "the radiation pattern is then a 2d gaussian field fully specified by its correlation function , whose spherical transform is the angular power spectrum , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the multipole number .",
    "if the 3d correlation does not depend upon multiplication by a scale factor , it is scale invariant .",
    "this does not translate into scale invariance in the 2d radiation correlation , whose features reflect the physical transport processes of the radiation through photon decoupling .",
    "the upper limit experiments were in fact highly useful in ruling out broad ranges of theoretical possibilities .",
    "in particular adiabatic baryon - dominated models were ruled out . in the early 80s , universes dominated by dark matter relics of the hot big bang lowered theoretical predictions by about an order of magnitude over those of the baryon - only models . in the 82 to mid-90s period",
    ", many groups developed codes to solve the perturbed boltzmann ",
    "einstein equations when such collisionless relic dark matter was present .",
    "armed with these pre - cobe computations , plus the lss information of the time , a number of otherwise interesting models fell victim to the data : scale invariant isocurvature cold dark matter models in 86 , large regions of parameter space for isocurvature baryon models in 87 , inflation models with radically broken scale invariance leading to enhanced power on large scales in 87 - 89 , cdm models with a decaying ( @xmath26 ) neutrino if its lifetime was too long ( @xmath27 ) in 87 and 91 .",
    "also in this period there were some limited constraints on `` standard '' cdm models , restricting @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and the amplitude parameter @xmath30 .",

    "they showed evidence for a first peak @xcite , although it was not well localized .",
    "a strong first peak , followed by a sequence of smaller peaks diminished by damping in the @xmath24 spectrum was a long - standing prediction of adiabatic models .",
    "for restricted parameter sets , good constraints were given on @xmath36 , and on @xmath28 and @xmath37 when lss was added  @xcite .",
    "* toco , boomerang & maxima : * the picture dramatically improved over the 3 years since april 1999 . in summer 99 , the ground - based toco experiment in chile @xcite , and in november 99 the north american balloon test flight of boomerang @xcite , gave results that greatly improved first - peak localization , pointing to @xmath38 . then in april 2000 dramatic results from the first cmb long duration balloon ( ldb ) flight , boomerang @xcite ,",
    "were announced , followed in may 2000 by results from the night flight of maxima @xcite .",
    "boomerang s best resolution was @xmath39 , about 40 times better than that of cobe , with tens of thousands of resolution elements .",

    "the boomerang analysis was improved and much more of the data were included , delivering information on the spectrum up to @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "maxima also increased its @xmath25 range  @xcite .",
    "boomerang carried a 1.2 m telescope with 16 bolometers cooled to 300 mk in the focal plane aloft from mcmurdo bay in antarctica in late december 1998 , circled the pole for 10.6 days and landed just 50 km from the launch site , only slightly damaged .",

    "* dasi , cbi & vsa : * dasi ( the degree angular scale interferometer ) , located at the south pole , has 13 dishes of size 0.2 m . instead of bolometers , it uses hemts , operating at 10 frequency channels spanning the band @xmath42ghz .",

    "dasi s spectacular results were also announced in april 2001 , unveiling a spectrum close to that reported by boomerang at the same time .",

    "cbi ( the cosmic background imager ) , based at 16000 feet on a high plateau in chile , is the sister experiment to dasi .",
    "it has 13 0.9 m dishes operating in the same hemt channels as dasi .",
    "the instrument measures 78 baselines simultaneously .",
    "the larger dishes by a factor of 4 and longer baselines imply higher resolution by about the same factor : the cbi results reported in may 2002 go to @xmath47 of 3500 , a huge increase over boomerang , maxima and dasi . only the analyses of data from the year 2000 observing campaign were reported . during 2000 , cbi  covered three deep fields of diameter roughly @xmath48 @xcite , and three mosaic regions , each of size roughly 13 square degrees @xcite . in analyzing such high resolution data at 30 ghz , great attention",

    ", acoustic wave patterns in the tightly - coupled photon - baryon fluid on scales below the comoving `` sound crossing distance '' at decoupling , @xmath64 ( @xmath65 physical ) , were viscously damped , strongly so on scales below the @xmath66 damping scale .",
    "after , photons freely - streamed along geodesics to us , mapping ( through the angular diameter distance relation ) the post - decoupling spatial structures in the temperature to the angular patterns we observe now as the primary anisotropies .",

    "free - streaming along our ( linearly perturbed ) past light cone leaves the pattern largely unaffected , except that temporal evolution in the gravitational potential wells as the photons propagate through them leaves a further @xmath67 imprint , called the integrated sachs - wolfe effect .",

    "detections of individual clusters are now routine . the power at @xmath55 seen in the cbi deep data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : clopt ] ) @xcite and in the bima data at @xmath82 @xcite may be due to the sz effect in ambient fields , @xcite .",
    "a number of planned hemt - based interferometers are being built with this ambient effect as a target : carma ( ovro+bima together ) , the sza ( chicago , to be incorporated in carma ) , ami ( britain , including the ryle telescope ) , and amiba ( taiwan ) .",
    "bolometer - based experiments will also be used to probe the sz effect , including the cso ( caltech submm observatory , a 10 m dish ) with bolocam on mauna kea , acbar at the south pole and the lmt ( large mm telescope , with a 50 metre dish ) in mexico . as well , apex , a 12 m german single dish , kobyama , a 10 m japanese single dish , and the 100 m green bank telescope can all be brought to bear down on the sz sky .",

    "[ fig : boommap ] ) and a pixel - pixel correlation matrix characterizing the noise . from this , various statistical quantities are derived , in particular the temperature power spectrum as a function of multipole , grouped into bands , and band - band error matrices which together determine the full likelihood distribution of the bandpowers  @xcite .",
    "fundamental to the first step is the extraction of the sky signal from the noise , using the only information we have , the pointing matrix mapping a bit in time onto a pixel position on the sky . in the april 2001 analysis of boomerang , and subsequent work , powerful use of monte carlo simulations was made to evaluate the power spectrum and other statistical indicators in maps with many more pixels than was possible with conventional matrix methods for estimating power spectra @xcite .    for interferometer experiments ,",
    "the basic data are visibilities as a function of baseline and frequency , with contributions from random detector noise as well as from the sky signals . as mentioned above",
    ", a baseline is a direct probe of a given angular wavenumber vector on the sky , hence suggests we should make `` generalized maps '' in `` momentum space '' ( fourier transform space ) rather than in position space , as for boomerang .",
    "a major advance was made in @xcite to deal with the large volume of interferometer data that we got with cbi , especially for the mosaics with their large number of overlapping fields .",
    "we `` optimally '' compressed the @xmath85 visibility measurements of each field into a @xmath86 coarse grained lattice in momentum space , and used the information in that `` generalized pixel '' basis to estimate the power spectrum and statistical distribution of the signals .",
    "there is generally another step in between the maps and the final power spectra , namely separating the multifrequency spatial maps into the physical components on the sky : the primary cmb , the thermal and kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich effects , the dust , synchrotron and bremsstrahlung galactic signals , the extragalactic radio and submillimetre sources .",
    "the strong agreement among the boomerang maps indicates that to first order we can ignore this step , but it has to be taken into account as the precision increases .    because of the 1 cm observing wavelength of cbi and its resolution , the contribution from extragalactic radio sources is significant .",
    "we project out of the data sets known point sources when estimating the primary anisotropy spectrum by using a number of constraint matrices .",
    "the positions are obtained from the ( 1.4 ghz ) nvss catalog . when projecting out the sources we use large amplitudes which effectively marginalize over all affected modes .",
    "this insures robustness with respect to errors in the assumed fluxes of the sources .",
    "the residual contribution of sources below our known - source cutoff is treated as a white noise background with an amplitude ( and error ) estimated as well from the nvss database @xcite .    *",

    "higher order ( concentration ) statistics ( 3,4-point functions , ) tell us of non - gaussian aspects , necessarily expected from the galactic foreground and extragalactic source signals , but possible even in the early universe fluctuations .",
    "for example , though non - gaussianity occurs only in the more baroque inflation models of quantum noise , it is a necessary outcome of defect - driven models of structure formation .",
    "( peaks compatible with fig .",
    "[ fig : clopt ] do not appear in non - baroque defect models , which now appear highly unlikely . )",
    "there is currently no evidence for a breakdown of the gaussianity in the 150 ghz maps as long as one does not include regions near the galactic plane in the analysis .",
    "we have also found that the one - point distribution of the cbi data is also compatible with a gaussian .",
    "however , since we know non - gaussianity is necessarily there at some level , more exploration is needed .    though great strides have been made in the analysis of the boomerang - style and cbi - style experiments , there is intense effort worldwide developing fast and accurate algorithms to deal with the looming megapixel datasets of ldbs and the satellites .",

    "as well , as long as @xmath10 is not exactly @xmath13 , it will vary with time , but the data will have to improve for there to be sensitivity to this , and for now we can just interpret @xmath10 as an appropriate time - average of the equation of state .",
    "the curvature energy @xmath96 also can dominate at late times , as well as affecting the geometry .",

    ". however , our philosophy is consider minimal models first , then see how progressive relaxation of the constraints on the inflation models , at the expense of increasing baroqueness , causes the parameter errors to open up .",
    "for example , with cobe - dmr and boomerang , we can probe the gw contribution , but the data are not powerful enough to determine much .",
    "planck can in principle probe the gravity wave contribution reasonably well .",
    "we use another 2 parameters to characterize the transport of the radiation through the era of photon decoupling , which is sensitive to the physical density of the various species of particles present then , @xmath111 .",
    "we really need 4 : @xmath112 for the baryons , @xmath113 for the cold dark matter , @xmath114 for the hot dark matter ( massive but light neutrinos ) , and @xmath115 for the relativistic particles present at that time ( photons , very light neutrinos , and possibly weakly interacting products of late time particle decays ) . for simplicity ,",
    "though , we restrict ourselves to the conventional 3 species of relativistic neutrinos plus photons , with @xmath115 therefore fixed by the cmb temperature and the relationship between the neutrino and photon temperatures determined by the extra photon entropy accompanying @xmath116 annihilation . of particular importance for the pattern of the radiation is the ( comoving ) distance sound can have influenced by recombination ( at redshift @xmath117 ) , @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the photon density , @xmath120 for 3 species of massless neutrinos and @xmath121 .",
    "the angular diameter distance relation maps spatial structure at photon decoupling perpendicular to the line - of - sight with transverse wavenumber @xmath122 to angular structure , through @xmath123 . in terms of the comoving distance to photon decoupling ( recombination ) , @xmath124 , and the curvature scale @xmath125 , @xmath126 is given by @xmath127 the 3 cases are for negative , zero and positive mean curvature .",

    ", we expect @xmath139",
    ". it is partly degenerate with @xmath30 and can not quite be determined at this precision by cmb data now .",
    "the lss also depends upon our parameter set : an important combination is the wavenumber of the horizon when the energy density in relativistic particles equals the energy density in nonrelativistic particles : @xmath140 , where @xmath141 . instead of @xmath142 for the amplitude parameter",
    ", we often use @xmath143 at @xmath144 for cmb only , and @xmath31 when lss is added . when lss is considered in this paper",
    ", it refers to constraints on @xmath145 and @xmath146 that are obtained by comparison with the data on galaxy clustering , cluster abundances and from weak lensing   @xcite . at the current time , the constraints from @xmath30 from lensing and cluster abundances are stronger thoes from @xmath147 , although , with the wealth of data emerging from the sloan digital sky survey and the 2df redshift survey , shape should soon deliver more powerful information than overall amplitude .",

    "when we allow for freedom in @xmath115 , the abundance of primordial helium , tilts of tilts ( @xmath148 ) for 3 types of perturbations , the parameter count would be 17 , and many more if we open up full theoretical freedom in spectral shapes . however ,",
    "as we shall see , as of now only 4 combinations can be determined with 10% accuracy with the cmb .",
    "thus choosing 8 is adequate for the present ; 7 of these are discretely sampled@xcite , with generous boundaries , though for drawing cosmological conclusions we adopt a weak prior probability on the hubble parameter and age : we restrict @xmath149 to lie in the 0.45 to 0.9 range , and the age to be above 10 gyr .",
