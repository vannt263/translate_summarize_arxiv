    "one of the most essential differences predicted between a superfluid and a normal fluid is the eventual appearance of quantized vortices in the former when set under rotation @xcite . not in vain ,",
    "since the demonstration of the occurrence of bose - einstein condensation @xcite , the nucleation of vortices in dilute ultra - cold atomic gases in rotating traps has been instrumental to elucidate the superfluid properties of these systems and has attracted much experimental and theoretical research ( see e.g.  refs.@xcite and references quoted therein ) .",
    "the prominence of the study of vortices in atomic gases transcends the frontiers of the field itself , because topological defects are cornerstones in cross - disciplinary areas of physics . in turn , very recently , the experimentation with bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices is stimulating new avenues in the investigation of quantum coherence and interference phenomena .    in the present work we study some properties of a slowly rotating bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattice @xcite .",
    "we are motivated by the recent advances achieved in the experimental manipulation of rotating condensates @xcite , on the one hand , and of condensates loaded into optical lattices @xcite , on the other hand .",
    "rotating ultracold bose gases in optical lattices are suitable systems to study quantum phenomena .",
    "in particular , the excitations , stability and dynamics of a vortex line in the superfluid regime have been recently addressed @xcite .",
    "concurrently , the physics of degenerate bose - fermi mixtures in optical lattices is attracting conspicuous attention .",
    "theoretical progress is being made in the basic understanding of the system s quantum phase diagram and the superfluid to mott - insulator transition @xcite , and experimentalists have already been able to prepare a degenerate mixture of rb and k atoms in a tight optical lattice @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is twofold .",
    "firstly , we wish to address the formation of vortices in a coherent array of bose - einstein condensates in a 1d optical lattice . in doing this",
    ", we will determine the dependence of the thermodynamic critical angular velocity @xmath0 for vortex formation @xcite on the laser intensity .",
    "secondly , we want to investigate the effect of trapped fermions on @xmath0 .",
    "attractive bose - fermi mixtures may experience collapse and thus , we will also discuss the impact of the optical lattice on the mechanical stability of the mixture .",
    "the manuscript has been organized as follows . in section",
    "[ theory ] a short description of the mean field model for the present problem is given .",
    "section [ bec ] is devoted to the discussion of the numerical results for a rotating boson condensate confined by magnetic and optical traps . in section [ mixture ]",
    "we address the properties of a @xmath1rb@xmath2k mixture loaded in an optical lattice .",
    "our concluding remarks are laid in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "finally , a derivation of the virial theorem for the mixture in the 1d optical lattice is given in the appendix .",
    "we consider a zero temperature mixture made of a @xmath1rb bose condensate ( b ) and a degenerate @xmath2k fermi gas ( f ) .",
    "they are confined by the axially - symmetric external potentials of a harmonic magnetic trap and of a stationary periodic optical lattice modulated along the @xmath3-axis .",
    "the lattice is produced by a far detuned laser , which hinders the possibility of spontaneuous scattering and yields practically equal rb and k optical potentials .",

    "the radial and axial frequencies of the harmonic trap are taken from a recent experiment @xcite : @xmath8 with @xmath9 hz , and @xmath10 with @xmath11 hz for @xmath1rb , while those for @xmath2k are a factor @xmath12 larger .",
    "the optical potential is determined by its period @xmath13 m @xcite and depth @xmath14 , where @xmath15 hz is the recoil energy and @xmath16 is a dimensionless parameter that provides the intensity of the laser beam .    for @xmath17 atoms of @xmath1rb confined in the harmonic trap ,",
    "the condensate is cigar - shaped with a thomas - fermi length @xmath18 m , and a radius @xmath19 m .",
    "the superimposed optical potential splits the bec over @xmath20 wells .",
    "we shall be concerned with a range of laser intensities that ensures full coherence of the condensate across the whole system @xcite .",
    "the criterion for the mott transition @xcite for the considered parameters leads to an estimate of a maximum lattice depth for the superfluid regime of @xmath21 khz @xcite . provided that the strength @xmath22 does not surpass largely this value , quantum tunneling between consecutive wells is still sufficient to retain coherence and one can apply the gross - pitaevskii theory for the order parameter to study the properties of the condensate .",

    "@xcite , certain aspects of the macroscopic properties and low - energy dynamics of a magnetically trapped bec in a tight optical lattice can be understood in terms of a renormalized interaction coupling constant @xmath53 and of an effective mass @xmath54 along the direction of the periodic optical potential .",
    "the increase of the radial size of the sample that one observes in panel ( c ) with respect to panel ( a ) is due to the increased repulsive effect of the boson - boson interaction when the system feels the optical lattice .",
    "it originates from the fact that the optical confinement produces a local compression of the gas inside each well @xcite .",
    "the axial size of the condensate also increases appreciably due to the combined effect of the repulsive interactions and the redistribution of atoms inside the potential wells .    in panel ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the optical lattice is superimposed to the condensate with the vortex state ( b ) . in a bulk superfluid ,",
    "the size of the vortex core is of the order of the healing length @xmath55^{-1/2}$ ] , where @xmath40 is the bulk density .",
    "this expression holds for inhomogeneous superfluids taking for @xmath40 the local boson density in the absence of vortices @xcite .",
    "thus , the vortex core size is larger for the outer sites of the split condensate , where the density is smaller .    in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the evolution of the density profile of the condensate along the @xmath3-axis , @xmath56 , with the laser intensity . in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we depict the total trapping potential felt by the atomic condensate . in the presence of a shallow 1d optical lattice ,",
    "the condensate profile starts developing small oscillations around the profile at @xmath57 which follow the periodic optical potential , but its spatial extension is nearly not affected .",
    "when the laser intensity increases the system nearly splits into separate condensates .",
    "the effect of the local compression inside each potential well of the lattice , as well as the increase of the axial size of the system , can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we plot the column density @xmath58 for the condensate in the harmonic trap alone and when the optical lattice is added . a deep optical lattice results in a visible reduction of the column density at the interior of the condensate and in an extended surface .",

    "the quantized circulation around the vortex line pushes the atoms away from it .",
    "the effect of the modification of the value of the lattice constant @xmath60 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . in this figure",
    "we plot the computed density profile @xmath61 of the boson atoms in the condensate for the same parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] but for a larger @xmath60 ( @xmath62 m ) .",
    "the thermodynamic critical angular velocity @xmath0 for nucleating a singly quantized vortex is obtained by subtracting from the vortex state energy @xmath63 in the rotating frame the ground - state energy @xmath64 , i.e. , @xmath65 @xcite , and it provides a lower bound to the critical angular velocity @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we plot @xmath0 as a function of the laser intensity for @xmath66 and for @xmath67 . for a fixed number of condensate atoms , @xmath0 decreases when @xmath22 increases , in agreement with the fact that the radial size of the system becomes larger in the presence of the optical lattice and the associated reduction of atoms along the symmetry axis ( see the decrease of the column density @xmath40 at the origin in fig .  [ fig3 ] with increasing @xmath22 )",
    "in turn , the increase of the inertia of the condensate along the direction of the laser beam due to the larger effective mass @xmath68 @xcite also contributes to the reduction of the critical angular velocity .    assuming that the relative effect remains of the same order in experiment , fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] predicts a sizeable @xmath69 reduction of @xmath0 already with a laser strength @xmath70",
    "khz for both of the @xmath41 values .",
    "the effect is enhanced the shallower the magnetic trap is .",
    "a less elongated magnetic trap would favor the appearence of a vortex at a slower rotation .",
    "for example , the values of @xmath71 shown in fig .  [ fig5 ] would be decreased by a 0.6 factor in a spherical trap with @xmath72 hz .",
    "the relative reduction of @xmath0 caused by @xmath70 khz with respect to @xmath57 would still be of 2023% .",
    "as the thermodynamic @xmath0 underestimates the actual critical frequency for vortex creation , dynamical calculations would be needed for a precise quantitative estimate of these changes .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] suggests an experiment to test the dependence of the critical frequency for vortex nucleation on the intensity of the optical lattice , since it shows that , for a rotating condensate with a given @xmath41 , a vortex line should nucleate at angular frequencies much lower than @xmath71 if a co - rotating deep 1d optical lattice is superimposed , whereas otherwise it would not .",
    "the experimental observation of this effect would provide a clear signature of the correctness of the physics predicted by the gross - pitaevskii theory for rotating condensates in optical lattices .",
    "with the purpose of assessing the effects of a trapped fermion cloud on the rotating condensate in an optical lattice , we consider next a @xmath1rb@xmath2k mixture .",
    "it is characterized by a large attractive bose - fermi interaction that assists the sympathetic cooling of the fermionic species down to the degenerate regime .",
    "there are various values of the interspecies scattering length @xmath35 published , depending on the type of experiment and techniques used @xcite . a recent measurement of @xmath35 at jila",
    "@xcite has established a value @xmath73 , which we adopt here because of its reduced experimental uncertainties .",
    "vortex states in @xmath1rb@xmath2k mixtures confined by a harmonic potential have been recently addressed @xcite ( although @xmath74 @xcite was employed ) . when a 1d optical lattice is switched on",
    ", the atomic species experience the trapping potential ( [ vextbf ] ) .",
    "we have carried out calculations for a mixture with @xmath75 and @xmath76 atoms , and the same parameters as in fig .",
    "we assume that the fermi component is in the normal  nonsuperfluid  but quantum degenerate phase , and consider that it is in a stationary state .",
    "this situation could be achieved experimentally by waiting long enough after the generation of the vortex in the condensate to let the drag force between bosons and fermions to dissipate .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] contour plots of the boson @xmath77 and fermion @xmath78 densities when the condensate hosts a vortex line , for two laser strengths : @xmath79 ( a , b ) and @xmath80 khz ( c , d ) .",
    "the condensate and the fermionic cloud are modulated by the regular pattern of the optical lattice .",
    "the large mutual attraction between fermions and bosons makes the effective interaction between bosons less repulsive than in the pure bec .",
    "furthermore , the boson atoms induce an effective attraction between fermions counteracting the fermi pressure . as a result ,",
    "the density of both species increases in the overlapping region , as if they were more strongly confined by the external potentials , and the condensate becomes more compact in space ( compare figs .",
    "[ fig6]c and [ fig1]d ) . still , the effect of the pauli exclusion principle is notorious in fig .  [ fig6 ] where the @xmath2k cloud is seen to extend to larger distances than the @xmath1rb atoms , both axially and radially .",
    "the presence of a vortex along the @xmath3-axis in the condensate component is apparent in panels ( a ) and ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] as the boson density vanishes on the vortex line .",
    "it is interesting to note that the large attractive @xmath35 leads to a visible depletion of the fermionic density on the @xmath3-axis as well , reminiscent of the bosonic vortex core .",
    "the effect should be directly observable experimentally .",
    "it is more evident in ( d ) where bosons and fermions are more tightly confined by the optical lattice .    in the present mixture",
    "we find that the presence of the quantum degenerate fermionic cloud does not change much the value of @xmath0 compared to the pure bec , nor its pattern against the optical lattice strength .",
    "indeed , for all the @xmath22 values considered here the critical frequency for vortex appearence is raised by @xmath81 , due to the enhancement of the condensate density at the core caused by the fermion atoms .",
    "the impact of the fermion cloud on @xmath0 is magnified in a deeper magnetic trap .",
    "for instance , if the same mixture was set in a trap with @xmath82 hz and @xmath83 hz , that preserves the aspect ratio @xmath84 used in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the critical frequency @xmath71 would increase by @xmath85 with respect to the @xmath86 case . in this squeezing magnetic trap , however , the effect of @xmath22 on @xmath0 is negligible ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "a peculiar feature of the @xmath1rb@xmath2k system , that stems from the interplay of the moderately repulsive @xmath34 and the strongly attractive @xmath35 , is the existence of a mechanical stability limit beyond which the system can not sustain more fermions . at high densities the strong interspecies attraction may overcome the pauli pressure and drive the ultracold gas mixture into collapse . the phenomenon has been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to address next the stability of the @xmath1rb@xmath2k system subject to an optical lattice .",
    "in fact , collapse is currently the focus of experimental attention because of the implications the instability has for constraining @xmath35 @xcite , and also because there are prospects that a radially - squeezed @xmath1rb@xmath2k mixture at a density close to collapse must be able to form stable bright soliton trains @xcite .    if we keep @xmath41 fixed at @xmath17 atoms as in the previous discussions , with @xmath88 we find that the boson - fermion mixture confined in the magnetic trap of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] would be stable up to virtually arbitrary fermion numbers , consistently with the findings of ref .",
    "increasing @xmath89 prompts the occurrence of collapse . in a trap with @xmath82 hz and @xmath90 hz , the @xmath17 rubidium atoms are able to retain up to a maximum of @xmath91 potassium atoms , when the system collapses .",
    "we recall that the effect on @xmath0 of @xmath92 and @xmath22 for this squeezing trap has been discussed before .",
    "now , with @xmath82 hz and @xmath90 hz , a decrease of @xmath93 can be seen when a 1d optical lattice is added .",
    "it is related to the increase of the effective local compression of the atoms caused by the optical trap .",
    "indeed , superimposing a 1d optical lattice with @xmath13 m and @xmath94 khz to this strongly confining harmonic trap , the @xmath1rb@xmath2k mixture with @xmath95 can sustain up to @xmath96 fermions only , i.e. , less than 30% of the @xmath57 value .",
    "the effect appears to be accessible to verification under present experimental conditions .",
    "it opens the possibility to study the collapse of a mixture for trapped fermion and boson numbers considerably smaller than in a pure harmonic trap .",
    "summarizing , we have determined the thermodynamic critical frequency for nucleating a quantized vortex in an array of coherent condensates within the gross - pitaevskii theory .",
    "next we have studied a bose - fermi mixture trapped in a 1d optical lattice to examine the effect on the value of @xmath0 of a fermionic cloud in the quantum degenerate phase .",
    "@xmath1rb@xmath2k mixtures may collapse and , in this regard , it has been shown that a 1d optical lattice can be an efficient degree of freedom to tune the onset of instability .",
    "our analysis of the relative variation of @xmath0 calculated by thermodynamic arguments may provide a useful information for future experiments .",
