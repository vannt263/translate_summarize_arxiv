    "we conclude that there are the three ranges of the magnetic field strength which we call : 1 ) the weak field ( @xmath140 ) , 2 ) the strong field ( @xmath141 ) , and 3 ) the super - strong field ( @xmath142 ) . for the most of the weak field range ( @xmath143 ) the electron @xmath37 and proton @xmath53 landau numbers can have very large values . inside the strong field range ( @xmath144 )",

    "we should like to emphasize that in the previous section we have derived the general expression ( [ cross ] ) for the cross section , accounting for the proton recoil motion , that can be used for arbitrary magnetic fields .",

    "magnetic filed it is clearly seen that @xmath301 and even @xmath302 if not many landau levels @xmath53 are available .",

    "the obtained above expressions for the cross section of the neutron inverse beta - decay can be transformed for the process @xmath308 in a magnetic field .",
