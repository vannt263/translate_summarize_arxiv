    ", one can use a natural extension .",
    "this is a bigger , invertible system @xmath7 that preserves both the original dynamics and the measure structure with @xmath8 being the coarsest @xmath9-algebra that makes this possible .",
    "many properties of a natural extension carry over to the original system .",
    "for example , the measure theoretical entropies of both systems are equal and they have the same mixing properties . in @xcite ,",
    "rohlin gave a canonical construction of a natural extension for a wide class of dynamical systems on lebesgue spaces .",
    "he showed that any two natural extensions of the same system are isomorphic , hence we can speak of * the * natural extension .",
    "different versions however can have their own advantages .    as a basic example , consider the angle doubling map @xmath10 on the unit interval @xmath11 , preserving lebesgue measure . a geometric version of the natural extension is given by the baker transformation ( figure  [ f : baker ] ) : @xmath12 here the dimension of the space @xmath13 is one larger than the dimension of @xmath14 , giving room to separate preimage branches .",
    "we can recover the original system simply by projecting onto the first coordinate .",
    "such a geometric version of the natural extension can be used for various purposes .",
    "for example , for @xmath15-transformations ( @xmath16 ) it yields an explicit expression of the density of the absolutely continuous invariant measure , see @xcite . in case @xmath15",
    "is a pisot number , certain geometric representations of algebraic natural extensions serve to identify periodic points ( see for example @xcite ) and are associated to multiple tilings of a euclidean space ( see for example @xcite ) . for",
    "the standard continued fraction transformation @xmath17 , also called the gauss map , a geometric natural extension substantially simplified proofs of results on the quality of the continued fraction approximation coefficients , such as the doeblin - lenstra conjecture and generalisations of borel s theorem ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for the @xmath18-continued fraction map @xmath19 , @xmath20 for parameter @xmath21 $ ] a geometric version was recently used to study the behaviour of the entropy as a function of @xmath18 in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a general method for obtaining geometric natural extensions of piecewise continuous maps with locally constant jacobian @xmath22 , which generalises the piecewise linearity of some of the above examples .",
    "the construction is based on the `` canonical markov extension '' approach introduced by hofbauer in @xcite , commonly called _ hofbauer tower _ ; see also investigations by buzzi @xcite and bruin @xcite . in short ,",
    "we apply the above `` extend the space with one dimension '' approach that works for the doubling map to the hofbauer tower .",
    "this can be found in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we show that this natural extension is isomorphic to a countable state markov shift and that it has several induced transformations that are bernoulli . in the last two sections we give examples of systems to which the construction applies .",
    "these include all piecewise linear expanding interval maps with positive entropy .",
    "other examples are certain higher dimensional piecewise affine maps , in particular a specific skew - product transformation called the random @xmath15-transformation , and rational maps on their julia set .",
    "in this section we give the construction of the hofbauer tower and of the geometric natural extension for the class of maps we consider in this article .",
    "we first describe this class of transformations .",

    "@xmath6 , but not yet that @xmath3 is @xmath6-invariant .",
    "this assumption will either be made later , or , starting from a reference measure @xmath44 , our construction will produce a @xmath6-invariant measure @xmath45 for which a geometric natural extensions will be constructed .",
    "the important step is that we acquire a markov measure for the hofbauer tower , which we explain in the following section .",
    "recall that @xmath46 denotes the collection of @xmath47-cylinder sets @xmath48 , defined by @xmath49 whenever @xmath50 .",

    "let @xmath57 denote the set of equivalence classes under this relation .",
