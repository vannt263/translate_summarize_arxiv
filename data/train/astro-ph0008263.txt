    "currently favored models include recycling of disk gas through a fountain ( _ e.g. _  bregman 1980 ) ; stripping from galactic satellites ; and infall of possibly primordial gas ( _ e.g. _  the local group model of blitz _",

    "these models place hvcs at from @xmath2 kpc to @xmath3 mpc respectively , a range of 100 in distance and @xmath4 in gas mass .",
    "faint , diffuse optical recombination emission lines are observed from some hvcs .",
    "h@xmath0 emission must be caused by ionization on the cloud , either from photo - ionization by lyman continuum radiation , or another process such as collisional ionization .",
    "measurements of h@xmath0 flux can constrain hvc distances , given models for the ionization processes .",
    "observing diffuse emission lines from hvcs is difficult because the emission is faint , night sky emission lines are strong and fluctuating , and hvcs are degrees across , larger than the field of view of most optical telescopes .",
    "fabry - perot observations of diffuse emission provide large collecting solid angle with moderate to high spectral resolution , needed to separate hvc emission from sky lines .",
    "fps have previously been used to detect h@xmath0 emission from four hvcs and the magellanic stream ( weiner & williams 1996 , tufte _ et al . _  1998 , bland - hawthorn _ et al . _",
    "chopping by several degrees between object and sky fields is necessary to obtain decent sky subtraction .",
    "figure 1 shows example spectra from the wide field camera f - p at the las campanas 2.5-m , with a field of view of 25@xmath5 and etalon fwhm 1.2   ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the top panel is a extracted spectrum of a 900 sec exposure of hvc 343 + 32140 , one of the hvcs brightest in h@xmath0 , before subtraction of a sky - field spectrum .",
    "the second panel is after a two - step sky subtraction : sky lines in the object - field and sky - field spectra are fit and subtracted , then the sky - field continuum is subtracted from the object - field continuum .",
    "the h@xmath0 flux is strong , 1060 milli - rayleighs ( mr ) , as is [ n  ii ] 6583 , with [ n  ii]/h@xmath0 = 1.1 .",

    "there is a wide range of hvc h@xmath0 intensity , but clouds in the same complex tend to have similar intensities , which suggests that the variations between complexes are due to hvc properties ( _ e.g. _  distances ) rather than extrinsic variations ( _ e.g. _  spatial variations in the ionizing field escaping from the galaxy ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the magellanic stream points vary widely : some points have strong emission while others have weak or no h@xmath0 despite a high  column density .",
    "strong emission in the ms is often located near cloud edges .",
    "a fundamental result of our h@xmath0 survey is that we have not found any cloud near or below our photon - limited noise ( generally @xmath11 mr at 2@xmath12 ) .",
    "the faintest h@xmath0 detections , at 4150 mr , are well above our noise limit .",
    "we always either detect h@xmath0 ( 15 of 20 hvcs ) , or are clobbered by residuals from sky - subtraction when hvcs are not well separated from sky lines , raising the detection limit .",
    "if h@xmath0 emission from hvcs is due to photo - ionization by flux from the galaxy , we can infer distances to the hvcs .",
    "we use the hvcs a and m with known distance brackets ( 410 kpc and @xmath13 kpc ; van woerden _",
    "et al . _  1999 ,",
    "et al . _",
    "1993 ) and h@xmath0 fluxes ( tufte _ et al . _",
    "1998 ) to normalize a model for the ionizing flux escaping from the galaxy . figure 3 shows contours of the ionizing photon flux @xmath14 in the model ; it has a total ionizing luminosity of @xmath15 photons s@xmath9 , distributed in an exponential disk , and models the galactic absorbing layer with a one - sided face - on optical depth to ionizing photons of @xmath16 , yielding an overall , angle - averaged escape fraction @xmath17 .",
    "( see also bland - hawthorn & maloney 1999 and bland - hawthorn , these proceedings . )",
    "the inferred distances of hvcs are indicated ; the error bars are for systematic variations by a factor 1.5 up or down in h@xmath18 ratio ( statistical errors on the fluxes are much smaller ) .",
    "the brightest clouds are within a few kpc of the galactic plane but fainter clouds are well away from the plane .",
    "these clouds at @xmath19 kpc are inconsistent with a galactic fountain origin , especially given their high velocities .",
    "however , the observed h@xmath0 in the magellanic stream can not be explained by this model ; ms ii and ms iv are much too bright compared to hvcs a and m. in fact , at a distance of @xmath20 kpc , the ms h@xmath0 emission can not be explained by a reasonable model of photoionization from the galaxy .",
    "the h@xmath0 photon flux is @xmath21 , so that h@xmath0 of 300600 mr at ms ii requires @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the required escape fraction is unrealistically large ( even if @xmath24 were increased by @xmath25 ) since most ionizing radiation must be absorbed in the galaxy to power regions .",
    "( in agreement with the authors , we find that bland - hawthorn & maloney 1999 overestimated the ionizing flux incident on the ms . )",
    "furthermore , there are strong spatial variations in the ms h@xmath0 , shown by the large dispersion of points in figure 2 .",
    "photoionization from the galaxy should produce roughly the same h@xmath0 flux on any  surface optically thick to ionizing radiation , since the ionizing photons travel nearly along our line of sight to the ms .",
    "factors of 23 variation between different points are tolerable either from variations in the incident field or geometry of the absorbing surface , but factors of 30 are not .    a second source of ionization in the galactic halo is needed to explain the ms h@xmath0 .",
    "simply put , why are some points in the magellanic stream brighter than complexes a and m , despite being much further away ?",
    "the only likely source is collisional ionization , probably from interaction with hot halo gas through ram pressure and turbulent mixing / thermal conduction ( weiner & williams 1996 ) .",
    "the ms radial velocities are large and the space velocities with respect to halo gas are probably above 200 km  s@xmath9 ; energy input from ram pressure goes as @xmath26 , so it may explain the brightness of the ms with respect to hvcs a and m , but it is barely adequate for reasonable halo gas densities ( weiner & williams 1996 ) ; perhaps the magellanic stream clouds are colliding with each other .",
    "collisional ionization is required , but the brightest ms points remain a puzzle .",
    "recent fuse detections of o  vi absorption in the magellanic stream and in a few hvcs provide further evidence for collisional ionization in hvcs ( sembach _ et al . _  2000 ) .",
    "o  vi can be produced collisionally in hot gas at @xmath27 k , which could arise from the interaction of an  cloud with hot halo gas , but o  vi can not realistically be produced in hvcs by photoionization from o stars .",
    "given the existence of a second source of ionization in the galactic halo , simple photoionization models may not yield reliable distances .",
    "however , robust predictions can still be made for a relation of h@xmath0 flux to distance .",
    "hvcs which are bright in h@xmath0 ( as hvcs go ) are likely only a few kpc from the galactic plane .",
    "the brightest hvcs plotted in figure 2 ( l , gcp , cr ) have inferred distances which give them low `` deviation velocities '' ( wakker & van woerden 1991 ) , so they are not too far from galactic differential rotation , despite having high @xmath28 ; these hvcs could well be recycled disk gas .",
    "high [ n  ii]/h@xmath0 ratios suggest high - metallicity gas photoionized by a hardened radiation field , as in the extraplanar diffuse ionized gas of ngc 891 ( rand 1998 ) .",
    "conversely , if an hvc is very far from the galaxy , the only source of ionization is the metagalactic uv background",
    ". then the hvc should be very faint in h@xmath0 , approaching the upper limits on h@xmath0 emission from isolated extragalactic h  i clouds : @xmath29 mr at @xmath30 from the giovanelli - haynes cloud ( vogel _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) and @xmath31 mr at @xmath30 from the leo ring ( donahue _ et al .",
    "_  1995 ) .",
    "we do not find any hvcs that are very faint , even though our photon - limited noise is generally 1020 mr ( 2@xmath12 ) : we either detect h@xmath0 , or are limited by sky subtraction residuals .",
    "the faintest hvcs we find are 16543280 , 4752129 , 22734 + 114 , and 230 + 61 + 165 , with h@xmath0 emission at 4148 mr . in the photoionization model of figure 3",
    "their distances are @xmath32 , and 26 kpc from the sun .",
    "we can push the distances to the limit by considering solely collisional ionization : the hvc h@xmath0 fluxes are some 5 - 15 times smaller than the fluxes typical of the magellanic stream .",
    "if we attribute the h@xmath0 to interaction with hot halo gas , and assume that the hot gas density falls off as @xmath33 to @xmath34 , the hvcs can be at most 2 to 4 times farther than the ms , or 100 - 200 kpc .    at distances of somewhere between 20 and at most 200 kpc , the h@xmath0-faint hvcs are not local group objects as defined by the blitz _",
    "et al . _  ( 1999 ) model .",
    "however , their low [ n  ii]/h@xmath0 ratios suggest low metallicity , and they are not easily produced by a galactic fountain : for example , hvc 16543280 , with @xmath35 km  s@xmath9 , has faint h@xmath0 , is at least 10 kpc away ( 20 kpc galactocentric radius ) , and has a large mass and kinetic energy ; perhaps it is infalling tidal debris .",
    "the best explanation for these h@xmath0-faint hvcs is still likely to be gas , of uncertain origin , accreting onto the galaxy .",
