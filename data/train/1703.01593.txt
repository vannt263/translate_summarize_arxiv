    "the _ nonlinear complex heat equation _",
    "@xmath1 where time variable @xmath2 and space variable @xmath3 are real and amplitude @xmath4 is complex , is a model equation combining a purely dispersive nonlinearity and a purely diffusive coupling .",
    "it appears as a particular limit of complex ginzburg ",
    "landau equations , and displays the peculiar feature that there is no characteristic scale for the complex amplitude @xmath5 ( that is , equation is scale - invariant , see [ scale_inv ] below ) .    despite its simplicity",
    ", this equation displays a nontrivial dynamical behaviour .",
    "it was introduced by p.  coullet and l.  kramer @xcite as a model equation exhibiting travelling fronts induced by non - variational effects , called `` retracting fronts '' .",
    "indeed , consider an initial condition connecting the state @xmath6 to a homogeneous oscillatory state .",
    "the effect of the coupling term is to smooth the interface ( without the nonlinear term one would observe a self - similar repair ) , but the nonlinear term generates a phase gradient that pushes the interface in favour of the zero - amplitude state .",
    "numerically , the solution converges towards a travelling front that balances these effects of diffusion and nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "when a small perturbation is added , rending , on one hand the zero - amplitude state slightly unstable , and on the other hand homogeneous perturbation at a certain finite amplitude stable , then the presence of these retracting fronts induces spatio - temporal intermittency @xcite . as a matter of fact the initial motivation of coullet and kramer to introduce a model equation displaying this phenomenon was an experiment of rayleigh - bnard convection with rotation at small prandtl numbers , for which intermittend convection without hysteresis was observed @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to investigate the existence of these retracting fronts for the model equation [ nlche ] .",
    "the spatially homogeneous solutions of equation [ nlche ] are the `` trivial '' solution @xmath7 and , for every pair @xmath8 of real quantities , the spatially homogeneous time - periodic solution @xmath9 a larger class of particular solutions are uniformly translating and rotating solutions . for sake of clarity ,",
    "let us state a formal definition .",
    "a solution @xmath10 of equation [ nlche ] is called a _ uniformly translating and rotating solution _ if there exist real quantities @xmath11 and @xmath12 and a smooth function @xmath13 such that , for every @xmath14 in @xmath15 , @xmath16    our target is the more specific class of particular solutions defined immediately below , and illustrated on [ fig : shape_front ] .",
    "let @xmath17 denote a positive quantity .",
    "a solution @xmath10 of equation [ nlche ] is called a _ retracting front of amplitude",
    "@xmath17 _ if there exist a positive quantity @xmath11 ( velocity ) and a smooth function @xmath13 such that , for every @xmath14 in @xmath15 , @xmath18 and such that @xmath19    note that in this definition only fronts travelling `` to the right '' are considered .",
    "of course this is an arbitrary choice , since for every such retracting front , space reversibility @xmath20 yields the existence of a symmetric travelling front travelling `` to the left '' , with similar properties .",
    "relevant uniformly translating and rotating solutions of equation [ nlche ] actually reduce to retracting fronts , as stated by the following proposition .",
    "[ prop : only_ret_fr ] every uniformly translating and rotating solution of equation [ nlche ] with a bounded amplitude is either a spatially homogeneous solution of the form [ spat_hom ] or a retracting front ( or the image of the retracting front by the @xmath20 symmetry ) .",
    "this proposition will be proved along the proof of the main statement of this paper ( [ thm ] below ) ; to be more precise [ prop : only_ret_fr ] follows from [ lem : a_mon , lem : vanishing , lem : om_pos , lem : unst_man ] , proved in [ sec : monotonic , sec : vanishing , sec : plus_infty , sec : minus_infty ] , respectively .    besides space reversibility and the obvious symmetries that are time translation @xmath21 , space translation @xmath22 , and rotation ( phase translation ) of the complex amplitude @xmath23 , equation [ nlche ] displays , for every @xmath24 in @xmath25 , the following scale - invariance symmetry : @xmath26 in particular there is no characteristic scale for the modulus @xmath27 of the amplitude . because of these symmetries , retracting fronts defined above go by three - parameter families : one parameter for space - time translation , one for rotation ( phase translation ) of the complex amplitude , and one for the scale invariance [ scale_inv ] . due to this scale invariance",
    ", we shall without loss of generality restrict ourselves in some of the next statements to retracting fronts of amplitude @xmath28 ( those go by two - parameter families  space - time and phase translations instead of three ) .",
    "we are going to distinguish two subclasses among those retracting fronts .",
    "the next two propositions are preliminary results that will ease the statement of this definition .",
    "[ prop : monotonic_amplitude ] for every retracting front of equation [ nlche ] , the ( modulus of the ) amplitude is nonzero and strictly increasing on the real line .    in other words ,",
    "the function @xmath29 is strictly increasing on @xmath30 ( and it vanishes nowhere ) .",
    "as for [ prop : only_ret_fr ] above , this proposition will be proved along the proof of the main result of this paper ( [ thm ] below ) ; to be more precise [ prop : monotonic_amplitude ] follows from .    as a consequence , if @xmath31 is a retracting front ( say of amplitude equal to @xmath28 ) , the first order variation of the phase of @xmath32 , that is the quantity : @xmath33 is defined for all @xmath34 in @xmath30 .",
    "[ prop : monotonic_phase ] for every retracting front of equation [ nlche ] , the phase is strictly increasing on the real line .",
    "in other words , the first order variation [ first_order_var_phase ] of the phase of @xmath35 is positive for every real quantity @xmath34 . as for [ prop : only_ret_fr , prop : monotonic_amplitude ] above , this proposition will be proved along the proof of the main result of this paper ( [ thm ] below ) ; to be more precise [ prop : monotonic_phase ] follows from ) .",
    "now let us make the announced distinction .",
    "a retracting front @xmath36 ( of amplitude @xmath28 ) is said to be :    1 .",
    "_ steep _ if : * the rate at which @xmath37 approaches @xmath28 when @xmath34 approaches @xmath38 is exponential , namely : @xmath39 * and the variation of the phase when @xmath34 approaches @xmath38 is finite , in other words : @xmath40 2 .   _",
    "gradual _ if : * the rate at which @xmath37 approaches @xmath28 when @xmath34 approaches @xmath38 is polynomial , namely : @xmath41 * and the variation of the phase when @xmath34 approaches @xmath38 is infinite , in other words : @xmath42    this definition presents a striking analogy with front propagation into unstable states ( say in the `` pulled '' case ) , where fronts often go by one - parameter families containing one one hand a single `` pulled '' front propagating at the `` linear spreading velocity '' and attracting localized initial conditions , and on the other hand for every larger velocity a front propagating at this larger `` leading edge dominated '' velocity @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus the `` steep '' versus `` gradual '' cases defined above may be related to those `` pulled - linear spreading '' versus `` leading edge dominated '' types of unstable fronts , respectively . here",
    "the situation is quite different however : the invaded equilibrium is neutral , not unstable , and it is the phase gradient generated by the nonlinearity combined with the diffusion term that moves the front in favour of the zero - amplitude state .    our main result , illustrated by [ fig : partition_velocity_line ] , is the following .    [ thm ]",
    "there exists a partition of the real line @xmath30 into three nonempty subsets : @xmath43 such that the following assertions hold .    1 .   for every velocity @xmath11 in @xmath44",
    ", there exists a unique ( up to space - time translation and rotation of complex amplitude ) retracting front of amplitude @xmath28 and velocity @xmath11 for equation [ nlche ] .",
    "this retracting front is : * steep if @xmath11 is in @xmath45 ; * gradual if @xmath11 is in @xmath46 .",
    "2 .   for every @xmath11 in @xmath47 , no retracting front of amplitude @xmath28 and velocity @xmath11 exists for equation [ nlche ] .",
    "3 .   the sets @xmath47 and @xmath46 are open subsets of @xmath30 , and @xmath48\\subset \\operatorname{v_\\textup{\\textrm{none}}}\\quad\\mbox{and}\\quad [ 2,+\\infty)\\subset \\operatorname{v_\\textup{\\textrm{gradual}}}\\,.\\ ] ]",
    "thus @xmath45 is a closed non - empty subset of @xmath49 .    )",
    ".,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    there is numerical evidence that the set @xmath45 is reduced to a single point ( the corresponding value approximately equals @xmath50 , see [ fig : partition_velocity_line ] ) but unfortunately we were unable to provide a proof of that .",
    "if this could be done , it would prove that the unique `` steep '' retracting front is the slowest among all retracting fronts of a given amplitude , reinforcing the analogy with front propagation into unstable states .",
    "there is also numerical evidence that , for every initial condition connecting the trivial solution @xmath51 to a spatially homogeneous solution [ spat_hom ] of a given amplitude @xmath17 , the solution converges towards a retracting front of amplitude @xmath17 ( this was already reported by coullet and kramer in @xcite ) .",
    "but this open question is by far beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "let @xmath11 and @xmath12 be two real quantities , and @xmath52 be a smooth complex - valued function of the real variable @xmath34 .",
    "the function @xmath53 is a solution of equation [ nlche ] if @xmath32 is a solution of the following equation : @xmath54 let us assume that the function @xmath52 never vanishes and , proceeding as van saarloos and hohenberg in @xcite , let us write @xmath35 in polar coordinates and take the following notation : @xmath55 the quantities @xmath11 and @xmath12 will be respectively called _ velocity _ and _ frequency_. the quantities @xmath56 ( the modulus of the complex amplitude @xmath5 ) , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 will be respectively called _ amplitude _ , _ phase _ , and _ derivative of the phase_.    according to this notation , @xmath59 and equation [ ode_b ] is equivalent to the following differential system in @xmath60 : @xmath61 or to the following differential system in @xmath62 : @xmath63 besides , we see from [ syst_akq ] that @xmath64 satisfies the second order non - autonomous differential equation : @xmath65 a mechanical interpretation of equation [ 2nd_order_a ] ( the fact that the `` force '' term @xmath66 is repulsive ) already supports the idea that bounded solutions of system [ syst_akq ] might not be numerous ( this will be formalized in [ lem : a_mon ] below ) .",
    "the ( elementary ) proof of [ thm ] is summarized on [ fig : phase_space ] .",
    "it follows from a dynamical study of system [ syst_akq ] , in particular of all bounded solutions .",
    "we will show that the only relevant solutions lie on the unstable manifold of the hyperbolic saddle - focus @xmath67 in the invariant plane @xmath68 , and that this unstable manifold may either go to infinity , or converge towards the equilibrium corresponding to spatially homogeneous solutions [ spat_hom ] , and that this convergence may occur either through the two - dimensional stable manifold of this equilibrium , or through its one - dimensional center manifold .",
    "the partition of @xmath30 into three subsets stated in [ thm ] follows .     in the case @xmath69 .",
    "equilibrium @xmath70 corresponds to spatially homogeneous time - periodic solutions of amplitude @xmath28 for equation [ nlche ] .",
    "this equilibrium has a two - dimensional stable manifold and a one - dimensional center manifold .",
    "the center - manifold is tangent to the direction of eigenvector @xmath71 , and the quantity @xmath17 is increasing along solutions close to @xmath70 on this center manifold .",
    "trajectories in the stable manifold of @xmath70 approach this point tangentially to the ( vertical ) eigenvector @xmath72 .",
    "retracting fronts correspond to homoclinic connections between @xmath67 and @xmath70 .",
    "gradual retracting fronts approach @xmath70 though its center manifold , while for steep retracting fronts it is through the stable manifold .",
    "trajectories in the @xmath68 plane and in the stable space of @xmath70 were drawn in the case @xmath73 .",
    "note that some scales are incorrect ( for instance @xmath74 is larger than @xmath28 whereas it looks the opposite on the figure ) . ]",
    "symmetries of system [ syst_akq ] are stated in [ sec : symmetries ] . in [ sec : monotonic ] we use equation [ 2nd_order_a ] ( and its mechanical interpretation ) to show that relevant solutions must have a monotonic amplitude , with a sense of monotonicity opposite to that of the velocity @xmath11 ( whih plays the role of a damping coefficient in this equation ) .",
    "the very same idea is used in [ sec : vanishing ] to show that solutions of the second order differential equation [ ode_b ] that vanish at some point are unbounded . in [ sec : plus_infty ] we show that relevant solutions exist only if @xmath12 is positive , and that they must approach the equilibrium @xmath75 ( corresponding to spatially homogeneous solutions [ spat_hom ] of amplitude @xmath76 ) at plus infinity . in [ sec : neighb_equil ] we observe that this equilibrium has a two - dimensional stable manifold and a one - dimensional center manifold , and we give a rough description of this center manifold .",
    "dynamics in the invariant plane @xmath68 is studied ( recalled ) in [ sec : a_equals_0 ] . in [ sec : minus_infty ] we prove that the sole relevant solutions lie in the unstable manifold of equilibrium @xmath67 .",
    "finally , the dynamical behaviour on this unstable manifold and the final splitting argument is given in [ sec : unst_man ] .",
    "the three following symmetries hold for system [ syst_akq ] and the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 : @xmath77 they can be viewed , respectively , as consequences of the following properties of initial equation [ nlche ] :    * rotation invariance : @xmath78 , * space reversibility : @xmath79 , * scale invariance : @xmath80 .    according to @xmath81-symmetry [ a_-a_sym ] , it is sufficient to study system [ syst_akq ] on half - space @xmath82 ; by the way the plane @xmath83 is invariant , as are the two complementary open half - spaces . obviously , for every solution to this system ( defined on a single interval ) , the function @xmath64 either identically vanishes or never vanishes .    according to space reversibility [ rev_sym ] ,",
    "it is sufficient to study system [ syst_akq ] either for @xmath11 nonnegative or nonpositive .",
    "outside of the invariant plane @xmath83 , system [ syst_akq ] has no equilibrium if @xmath12 is nonpositive , and two symmetric equilibria at : @xmath84 if @xmath12 is positive .",
    "these two equilibria correspond to spatially homogeneous solutions [ spat_hom ] of equation [ nlche ] .    according to scale invariance [ scale_sym ]",
    ", frequency @xmath12 can be normalized to @xmath28 , @xmath85 , or @xmath86 . in view of the fact that the nonlinear term in initial equation [ nlche ] `` pushes in the trigonometric sense '' , nonpositive values of @xmath12",
    "are expected to be irrelevant ( this will be proved below ) .",
    "in view of the expression of @xmath87 in equation [ 2nd_order_a ] , since the force term in this equation is repulsive , we expect that , if at some point the derivative @xmath88 does not have the same sign as the velocity @xmath11 ( which plays in [ 2nd_order_a ] the role of a dissipation coefficient ) , then the amplitude @xmath17 must diverge either in the future on in the past .",
    "the following lemma formalizes this heuristics .",

    ", there exists @xmath111 in @xmath112 such that @xmath113 .",
