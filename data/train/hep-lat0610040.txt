    "the description of deconfined hadronic states from a low energy confining theory is an exciting theoretical problem and a challenging numerical task . with the increasing power of computers devoted to lattice qcd and the progress made by algorithms ,",
    "it is nowadays possible to study low energy hadron - hadron systems from first qcd principles .",
    "contrarily to hadron masses and form factors , scattering properties can not be computed from infinite volume euclidean simulations @xcite .",
    "the link between a field theory formulated in an euclidean space and the scattering observables is however made possible by studying the volume dependence of the bound state spectra in a finite box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the underlying formalism was developed by m. luscher and collaborators in a series of papers @xcite and has been recently updated in view of applications to nuclear and hadronic physics @xcite .",
    "this formalism was formerly applied to extract the hadron - hadron scattering lengths in the quenched approximation @xcite , and more recently to obtain the low energy scattering parameters in @xmath0 @xcite , @xmath1 @xcite and even nucleon - nucleon @xcite systems from fully dynamical lattice qcd calculations .",
    "these calculations are crucial in providing some insight on the fundamental parameters of the hadron - hadron interaction , as well as low energy observables which are poorly known since hardly accessible experimentally .",
    "the aim of our work is to test the applicability of luscher relations in a model which , on one hand , would contain the main physical ingredients of hadron - hadron interaction and , on another hand , would be simple enough to be independently controlled .",
    "this is provided by the yukawa model , in which a massive scalar particle is exchanged between two fermions .",
    "when generalized to pseudoscalar and vector exchanges , it constitutes the keystone of baryon - baryon interaction models @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we have considered the non relativistic reduction of the yukawa model that we have solved in a 3-dimensional @xmath2 lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the solutions have been obtained using finite difference schemes in close analogy with the methods used in lattice field theory simulations .",
    "the @xmath3-dependence of the eigenenergies have been used to extract the infinite volume low energy parameters , namely the scattering length and the effective range .",
    "contrary to the quantum field lattice calculation , these quantities can be besides accurately computed by solving the corresponding one - dimensional schrodinger radial equation in an independent way .    despite its simplicity",
    ", the non relativistic yukawa model considered here contains an essential ingredient of a realistic interaction  its finite range  which plays a relevant role in view of extracting the low energy parameters from the finite volume spectra .",
    "it offers a wieldy and physically sound tool to test the validity of the different approaches discussed in the literature , in particular the large and small @xmath3-expansion .",
    "the full quantum field contents of this model have also been considered in a lattice calculation .",
    "preliminary results can be found in @xcite .",
    "a similar study was undertaken in @xcite in the framework of an effective field theory without pions eft(@xmath4 ) and from a slightly different point of view .",
    "these authors fix the values of the low energy parameters and obtain the energy levels assuming they satisfy luscher equations @xcite while in our case all these quantities are independently generated by solving a dynamical model and used to find their applicability conditions .",
    "the properties of the non relativistic yukawa model in the continuum are briefly introduced in section 2 .",
    "section 3 is devoted to explain the numerical methods used for its solution on a 3-d torus .",
    "results concerning scattering and bound states are displayed in section 4 and some final remarks are given in the conclusions .",
    "we consider a system of two non relativistic particles interacting by a yukawa potential of strength @xmath5 and range parameter @xmath6 @xmath7 this potential is obtained by fourier transforming the born amplitude @xmath8 @xmath9 of the meson - fermion interaction lagrangian ( see figure [ diag_wc ] ) : @xmath10    where @xmath11 is a dirac field with mass m , @xmath12 a scalar field with mass @xmath6 and in which the non relativistic reduction ",
    "@xmath14  has been applied @xcite .",
    "the same potential results from a model with purely scalar fields .",

    "we will focus hereafter on finding the solutions of a unit mass particle in the potential @xmath26 what we will call the dimensionless yukawa model .",
    "all length parameters involved must be therefore understood in units of the inverse exchanged mass @xmath27 .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ lint ] ) gives rise to an attractive potential , but disregarding its relation with the underling field theory , the repulsive case @xmath28 can be considered as well .    the asymptotic norm @xmath29 of a bound state with energy @xmath30 is defined as @xmath31 with @xmath32 normalized by @xmath33    the convention used for the scattering length is such that the regular zero - energy solution of ( [ sch_rra ] ) is asymptoticaly given by @xmath34 or equivalently the low - energy ( s - wave ) phase - shifs given by @xmath35 it can be shown that , in the limit of weak coupling constant , one has @xmath36 which correspond to the born approximation of the schrodinger equation with the yukawa model ( see appendix [ ap1 ] ) .    ) and first excited ( @xmath37 ) s - wave state as a function of the coupling constant @xmath38 in the dimensionless yukawa model ( [ vad]),width=321 ]     in the dimensionless yukawa potential ( [ vad ] ) as a function of the coupling constant @xmath38 .",
    "dashed line correspond to the repulsive case ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the tangents at the origin indicates the corresponding born approximation @xmath39 and the vertical asymptote the two first bound state singularities at @xmath40 and @xmath41 . ]",
    "the `` universal '' functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 are displayed in figures [ eps_g ] and [ a_g ] .",
    "the system has a first bound state ( @xmath30 ) for coupling constant @xmath38 above some critical value @xmath42 at which @xmath25 has a pole .",
    "an infinity of similar branches  and corresponding @xmath25 poles ",
    "appear for the excited states : @xmath37 at @xmath41 , @xmath43 at @xmath44 ",
    "it will be of further interest to consider also the effective range parameter @xmath45 which appears in the low energy expansion @xmath46    it is worth noticing that the solutions obtained by inserting potential ( [ v ] ) in the schrodinger equation correspond to summing up the iterations of the diagram displayed in figure [ diag_wc ] , i.e. the so called `` ladder '' approximation .",
    "this represents a small  though infinite  part of the diagrams included in the interaction lagrangian ( [ lint ] ) .",
    "attemps to include all the interaction terms of this lagrangian in two - body bound and scattering states have been presented in @xcite in the framework of lattice quantum field calculation .    though the solutions of ( [ sch_rra ] ) can be easily obtained with great accuracy , we are interested on the results provided by the same numerical schemes than the ones used on lattice calculations .",
    "thus , by using finite difference methods on an equidistant grid with stepsize @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath48 one obtains the ground state binding energies @xmath30 and low - energy scattering parameters given respectively in tables [ tab_bs ] and [ tab_lep ] .    .binding energy @xmath49 and radius @xmath50 for the ground state of the yukawa model using finite difference methods with stepsize @xmath47 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     these examples indicate that the critical lattice size is not given by the interaction range but by the size of the bound state itself .",
    "it is nevertheless possible by means of equation ( [ b_l1l2 ] ) to access the binding energies of loosely bound states like deuteron .",
    "notice however , that in order to have a few percent accuracy on the binding energy , a consequent number of lattice points @xmath51 would be in this case required .",
    "the limit @xmath52 of @xmath53 obtained in appendix [ ap2 ] , holds for bound as well as for scattering ones : in both cases the eigenenergies display the @xmath54 law given by equation ( [ a000 ] ) .",
    "the differences in @xmath53 appear clearly in the regions where the interaction plays no role , which in the yukawa model is at @xmath55 .",
    "they are manifested by calculating the quantity @xmath56  which corresponds to @xmath57 of the previous section  and comparing the results for bound and scattering states .",
    "this has been done in figure [ l3epsl_allg_norm_z2 ] for increasing values of g. for the bound state case ( solid lines ) one can see a cubic divergence corresponding to @xmath30 term in ( [ luscher_bs ] ) . for scattering states ( dashed lines ) one",
    "observe a linear dependence before reaching an horizontal asymptote @xmath58 .",
    "both behaviours are easy to disentangle in the extreme cases of deeply bound state or small scattering length but it becomes increasingly difficult when approaching resonant scattering and/or loosely bound state , unless huge number of lattice points are used @xcite .",
    "we have obtained the solutions of the non relativistic yukawa model ( [ v ] ) in a 3-dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions and examined the possibility to extract infinite volume low energy parameters  scattering length @xmath59 and effective range @xmath45  and bound state binding energies from the computed eigenstates @xmath60 at finite lattice sizes @xmath61 .",
    "the eigenergies @xmath60 , and corresponding eigenfunctions , have been calculated using finite difference schemes and propagation in the euclidean time , in close analogy with the methods used in lattice field theory simulations .",
    "the low energy parameters have been independently computed by solving the corresponding one - dimensional schrodinger radial equation .",
    "we have considered different approximations of the luscher relations and shown that a lattice size of @xmath55  in units of the meson exchanged compton wave lenght @xmath62  is enough to determine the low energy parameters at few % accuracy .",
    "the method is based in computing the energies at two different lattice sizes and solving a linear system of rank two .",
    "such a possibility is independent of the scattering length value and applies in the resonant case as well .",
    "we have found in particular that the effective range @xmath45 plays a crucial role in determining the scattering length value at moderate lattice volumes .",
    "we have shown that in the limit of small lattice sizes , the l - dependence of eigenenergies is dominated by an @xmath63 term , where @xmath38 is the strength parameter of the dimensionles potential ( [ vad ] ) .",
    "this regime is already reached at moderate sizes @xmath64 , making ambiguous the extraction of the scattering lenght by means of luscher expansion ( [ luscher_a ] ) .",
    "the behaviour is the same for bound and scattering states and applies to a large class of potentials .    for loosely bound states",
    ", the critical lattice size is determined by the spatial extension @xmath65 of the state .",
    "we have shown that for the deuteron case it is however possible to get accurate values of the binding energy and asymptotic norm with @xmath66 .",
    "the parameters of deeply bound states are well determined , like for the scattering case , with lattice volumes @xmath55 .",
    "the results have been obtained with a non relativistic model , which is justified by the small energies involved in the calculations . despite its simplicity , the model considered contains an essential ingredient of the hadron - hadron interaction  its finite range  which plays a relevant role in view of extracting the low energy parameters from the finite volume spectra .",
    "it offers a wieldy and physically sound tool to test the validity of the different approaches discussed in the literature to study the low energy scattering of baryon - baryon or meson - baryon systems from a lattice simulations in qcd .",
    "the results presented in this work have been essentially limited to the ground state of central attractive interactions , depending only on one paremeter .",
    "the method can be easily applied to more involved interactions , like hard core repulsive terms or non central potentials leading to coupled channel equations .",

    "we would like to study here the zero volume limit of equation ( [ sch_3d ] ) with periodic boundary conditions and a potential of the form ( [ vl ] ) .",
    "to this aim , it is useful to develop the periodic wave function in a fourier series : @xmath87 and similarly for the potential , @xmath88 by inserting these expresions into equation ( [ sch_3d ] ) it results the following infinite system of coupled linear equations : @xmath89c_{\\vec{n } } + \\sum_{\\vec{n}'\\in z^3 } v_{\\vec{n}-\\vec{n } ' } c_{\\vec{n } ' }   = 0\\ .\\ ] ]    the fourier coefficients of the potential , @xmath90 , take a rather simple form due to the interactions with the `` surrounding world '' , @xmath91 for the dimensionless yukawa potential ( [ vad ] ) they read : @xmath92 the leading term in the small volume limit is given by @xmath93 .",
