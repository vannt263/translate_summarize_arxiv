    "the unique feature of @xmath0he as the lightest self - conjugate nucleus with the simplest closed - shell structure prompts both experimentalists and theorists to study its photodisintegration reaction in the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) region .",
    "since the reaction proceeds mainly by an electric dipole ( e1 ) transition in the gdr region , the photodisintegration study provides a wealth of fundamental information on nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions , meson exchange currents @xcite as well as the possibility to study the charge symmetry of the strong interaction @xcite .",
    "the photodisintegration study also gives important insight on the rapid neutron capture process ( r - process ) nucleosynthesis induced by neutrino - driven wind from a nascent neutron star @xcite , since the neutrino transitions are the direct analogs of the giant electric dipole resonance observed in the photodisintegration @xcite .",
    "a considerable amount of theoretical work on the photodisintegration of @xmath0he has been carried out in the gdr region . above 50 mev ,",
    "the two - body @xmath0he(@xmath2,p)@xmath3h and @xmath0he(@xmath2,n)@xmath3he cross sections as well as the total cross section are well described by a plane - wave approximation , in which final state interactions ( fsi ) are known to play a minor role @xcite .",
    "below 30 mev , however , these cross sections are sensitive to fsi , meson exchange currents as well as to the choice of nn interaction @xcite .",
    "recently two different methods , one based on the lorentz integral transform ( lit ) @xcite and another based on faddeev - type alt - grassberger - sandhas ( ags ) integral equations @xcite , have been developed to accurately describe the low - energy dynamics of the @xmath0he photodisintegration . here",
    "it should be mentioned that although these models are quite different from each other , the calculated photodisintegration cross sections of @xmath3h and @xmath3he provided by these models agree with each other with high precision for the same nn interaction and three - nucleon forces ( 3nf ) @xcite .",
    "however , the values of the photodisintegration cross section of @xmath0he calculated by the same models differ significantly from each other .",
    "according to the calculation performed with the lit method , both the total and two - body cross sections show a pronounced gdr peak at around 26@xmath427 mev , and the total cross section fully satisfies both the e1 sum rule and the inverse - energy - weighted e1 sum rule @xcite . on the other hand , the calculation based on the ags method , carried out for the @xmath0he(@xmath2,n)@xmath3he cross section , shows a flat pattern below the three - body threshold energy of 26.1 mev , and the calculated cross section at 26.1 mev is only about 60% of the value derived by the lit method @xcite .    experimentally the two - body ,",
    "three - body , and total photodisintegration cross sections of @xmath0he have been measured in the energy range from 20 to 215 mev using quasi - monoenergetic photon beams and/or bremsstrahlung photon beams . concerning the two - body @xmath0he(@xmath2,p)@xmath3h and @xmath0he(@xmath2,n)@xmath3he reactions , their inverse ,",

    "previous data for the two - body and total cross sections are shown in figs .",
    "1(a ) , 1(b ) , and 1(c ) , respectively .",
    "it is quite interesting to note that above 35@xmath440 mev most of the previous @xmath0he(@xmath2,p)@xmath3h and @xmath0he(@xmath2,n)@xmath3he data agree with each other within their respective data sets @xcite .",
    "however , there appear to be discrepancies especially in the peak region of 25@xmath426 mev , where the data show either a pronounced gdr peak or a fairly flat excitation function as shown in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) . the experimental methods and their results in the previous measurements are briefly described below to obtain some hints of the origin of the large discrepancies mentioned above .",

    "the measurement was performed by detecting a charged fragment emitted at 90@xmath13 with respect to an incident tagged photon beam direction by means of windowless @xmath14e - e telescopes .",
    "here an angular distribution effect of a fragment was corrected for using theory .    in summary , although considerable experimental efforts have been made in determining @xmath12 , there remains a large discrepancy between separate measurements and simultaneous ratio measurements for the @xmath0he(@xmath2,p)@xmath3h and @xmath0he(@xmath2,n)@xmath3he channels .",
    "hence , one can hardly discuss the validity of the charge symmetry of the strong nuclear force using existing data .",
    "hence it is highly required to accurately measure these cross sections with use of a new method in the gdr region , in particular between 22 and 32 mev @xcite .    in designing a new experiment , it would be worthwhile to reconsider what we learned from previous data .",
    "firstly , we notice that both the @xmath0he(@xmath2,p)@xmath3h and @xmath0he(@xmath2,n)@xmath3he cross sections measured with bremsstrahlung photons are much larger than those measured with monoenergetic photons in the energy range from 22 to 30 mev , and they agree with each other above @xmath935 mev . theoretically the two - body as well as the total cross sections are well described by a plane - wave approximation and they agree with previous data above 50 mev @xcite .",
    "secondly , most experiments were performed separately for the @xmath0he(@xmath2,p)@xmath3h and @xmath0he(@xmath2,n)@xmath3he channels via the photodisintegration reactions and/or the inverse nucleon capture reactions .",
    "thirdly , the simultaneous two - body and three - body cross section measurements were performed using a cloud chamber , which did not allow us to take data in an event - by - event mode with a pulsed photon beam , which is necessary to reject background .",
    "one may conclude that the large discrepancies between different data sets could be due to background inherent to incident photon beams and/or due to an uncertainty of the normalization of the @xmath0he(@xmath2,p)@xmath3h and @xmath0he(@xmath2,n)@xmath3he cross sections .    in the present study we have carried out the simultaneous measurement of the two - body and three - body @xmath0he photodisintegration cross sections in the energy region between 21.8 and 29.8 mev using a monoenergetic pulsed laser compton backscattering photon beam by means of a newly developed 4@xmath1 time projection chamber containing @xmath0he gas as an active target .",
    "the experiment was carried out using a pulsed laser compton backscattering ( lcs ) photon beam at the national institute of advanced industrial science and technology ( aist ) .",
    "the charged fragments from the photodisintegration of @xmath0he were detected by means of a time projection chamber ( tpc ) . a schematic view of an experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "2 .     experimental setup for measurement of the photodisintegration of @xmath0he at aist . ]",
    "a quasi - monoenergetic pulsed lcs photon beam was produced via the compton backscattering of the photons from a nd : ylf laser in third harmonics ( @xmath15 351 nm ) with electrons circulating in the 800 mev storage ring teras at the aist @xcite .",
    "an lcs photon beam is well known to be an excellent probe to measure a photodisintegration cross section of a nucleus with little background associated with primary photon beam and with small uncertainty in determination of the lcs photon flux using a @xmath2-ray detector .",
    "even with this kind of setup , there are several difficulties inherent to the measurement of the photodisintegration cross section of @xmath0he , among which the cross section is small ( about @xmath91 mb ) , the photon beam flux is low , the target density of @xmath0he is low , and the energies of the fragments from the photodisintegration of @xmath0he in the gdr region are quite low , typically less than a few mev .",
    "hence , it has been crucial to develop a new detector , which enabled us to make a simultaneous measurement of the two - body and three - body photodisintegration cross sections of @xmath0he by detecting such a low energy fragment with an efficiency of 100% with a large solid angle of 4@xmath1 , and with a large signal - to - noise ratio .    in the present study we constructed a tpc which meets the mentioned requirements .",
    "a pulsed lcs @xmath2-ray with the maximum energies @xmath16 22.3 , 25 , 28 and 32 mev was used in the present experiment , obtained by changing the electron energy of the teras .",
    "the pulse width of the electron beam was 6 ns with a repetition rate of 100 mhz , while that of the laser photon beam was 150 ns with a repetition rate of 1 khz .",
    "pulsed laser photons scattered by electrons were collimated using a lead block with a hole of 2 mm in diameter and 200 mm in length to obtain quasi - monoenergetic lcs @xmath2-rays .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath17 was determined with accuracy better than 1% from the wavelength of the laser light and the kinetic energy of the electron beam .",
    "the electron beam energy has been calibrated by measuring the lcs @xmath2-ray energy generated with nd : yag laser photons in fundamental mode ( @xmath15 1064 nm ) @xcite .",
    "the half - width of the @xmath2-ray energy distribution was 2.5 mev at @xmath16 32 mev , and the obtained @xmath2-ray intensity was about 10@xmath0 photons / s .",
    "the tpc was placed 3 m downstream of the lead collimator .",
    "a 4@xmath1 time projection chamber containing @xmath0he gas as an active target was constructed to detect the charged fragments from the photodisintegration of @xmath0he with an efficiency of 100% .",

    "a mixed gas of 80% natural he and 20% ch@xmath18 with a total pressure of 1000 torr was filled in the vessel as a target for the photon - induced reactions and an operational gas of the tpc .",
    "the tpc consisted of a drift region with a uniform electric field with an area of 60@xmath1960 mm@xmath20 and a length of 250 mm , and a multi - wire proportional counter ( mwpc ) region as shown in fig .",
    "3 . the mwpc consisted of one anode plane and two cathode planes , which were set with a gap of 2 mm .",

    "the avalanche signal was picked up with both the anode- and cathode - wires .",
    "the cathode signals were used to measure the track of a charged fragment on an x - y plane , since the directions of these cathode wires were perpendicular to each other . a z - position of a charged fragment",
    "was determined by measuring the drift time of the electrons with use of a time to digital converter as described below .",
    "an anode signal was used to determine the amount of energy loss of a fragment in the drift region of the tpc . both",
    ", track and energy loss signals of a charged fragment were used to clearly identify a reaction channel . it should be noted that since a light charged fragment did not stop in the drift region , we observed various energy loss signals depending on a charged fragment type and on incident lcs @xmath2-ray energy .",
    "an external magnetic field has not been used in the present tpc configuration .",
    "the performance of the tpc was studied using the @xmath21am @xmath22-ray source and a si detector .",
    "the energy resolution of the tpc was measured as being 7.5% ( fwhm ) per anode wire . since the energy measured by an anode wire depends on the emission angle of a fragment with respect to the anode wire direction , we collimated an @xmath22-ray and determined its emission angle by using a coincidence signal between the tpc anode signal and the signal from the si detector .",
    "a drift velocity of ionized electrons was measured as a function of the z - position using the same measuring system .",
    "a typical value of the drift velocity was 7.00@xmath230.14 mm/@xmath24s .",
    "the time resolution was obtained as being 32 ns ( 1@xmath25 ) , which corresponded to the position resolution along the z - direction of 0.22 mm ( 1@xmath25 ) .",

    "a linear signal from the preamplifier was used as a stop signal for a time to digital converter ( tdc ) after discriminating the electronic noise by a comparator .",
    "a common start signal for the tdc is obtained from the output of a pulsed laser clock .",
    "both times , the leading edge and the trailing edge of an input signal are recorded on the tdc not only to determine the drift time of electrons but also to unambiguously identify the reaction channel . to measure the amount of energy loss of a charged fragment by integrating the current of a signal , we recorded its pulse shape using a flash adc ( fadc ) and constructed a charge - integrated spectrum of a fragment in the off - line analysis .",

    "the width is set longer than the maximum drift time ( 36 @xmath24s ) of electrons in the tpc drift region in order to measure not only the photodisintegration event of @xmath0he but also background events .",
    "data from camac modules are acquired by a personal computer and recorded on a hard disk drive in an event - by - event mode .",
    "the tpc count rate during the experiment was several tens of counts per second , and thus the dead time of the data taking system was a few % ( monitored during the measurement ) .",

    "we observed @xmath26c events , since we used ch@xmath18 gas .",
    "the total event rate in the present experiment was of several tens of counts per second , and the event rate from the photodisintegration of @xmath0he and @xmath26c was of several tens of counts per hour , less than one thousandth of the background events . a detailed description of electron background , natural background and photodisintegration events is given here below .      _",

    "electron events were identified by their small pulse height .",
    "note that electron energy loss rate in the tpc was small , of the order of 0.1 kev / mm , since electron energy was in the range from a few mev to several tens of mev .",

    "since the track width of natural background is wider than that of electrons , the background might be due to an @xmath22-particle from a natural radioactivity such as rn contained in the tpc chamber or in the mixed gas of natural he and ch@xmath18 .",

    "firstly we discuss the latest @xmath0he(@xmath2,p)@xmath3h data using bremsstrahlung photons @xcite , which are larger than the data @xcite by about 40% at around 30 mev and are in good agreement with the data @xcite at 33 mev within the experimental uncertainty .",
    "note that the data @xcite were obtained using a monochromatic photon beam .",
    "this fact may indicate that a possible origin of the above mentioned discrepancy is due to background events inherent to measurement with bremsstrahlung photons .",
    "the former group used si(li ) detectors to detect protons from the @xmath0he(@xmath2,p)@xmath3h reaction .",
    "they carefully considered possible systematic errors such as the @xmath0he gas purity , the gas pressure , the efficiency of the si(li ) detectors , the energy losses in the gas target , the incident flux calibration , the bremsstrahlung shape , the effects due to the background subtraction and others .",
    "they had to subtract the background component in the si(li ) detector assuming an exponential fit to the low - energy photon data .",
    "they claimed that the validity of their background subtraction method has been supported by the test measurement of the @xmath29o(@xmath2,p)@xmath30n experiment .",
    "however , the cross section of the @xmath29o(@xmath2,p)@xmath30n reaction is about 10 times larger than that of @xmath0he , and therefore the ambiguity due to the background subtraction might not have been relevant in the test experiment .",
    "the contribution of background due to bremsstrahlung photons is expected to decrease with increasing the photon energy , since the energy of an emitted proton becomes higher .",
    "consequently the energy dependence of the difference between the two data sets mentioned above can be explained in this way .",
    "secondly , we discuss the result of the @xmath0he(@xmath2,n)@xmath3he reaction obtained by berman _",
    "@xcite , which was carried out using annihilation photon beams and bf@xmath8 tubes embedded in a paraffin matrix as a neutron counter .",
    "they carefully made various corrections due to the background from bremsstrahlung photons , the neutron detector efficiency , and others , and they concluded that their data points at 25.3 , 26.3 and 28.3 mev should have systematic uncertainties as large as 15% .",
    "if we take the systematic error in addition to statistical error , our data marginally agree with the data by berman _",
    "_ it should be stressed that we used a quasi - monoenergetic pulsed laser compton backscattering ( lcs ) photon beam , which is free from background inherent to bremsstrahlung photon beams , and we detected @xmath3he unambiguously by the nearly 4@xmath1 tpc containing @xmath0he gas as an active target .",
    "hence , we could determine the detection efficiency of @xmath3he with high accuracy .",
    "in the present work , we have carried out for the first time the direct simultaneous measurement of the two - body and three - body photodisintegration cross sections of @xmath0he in the energy range from 21.8 to 29.8 mev using a quasi - monoenergetic pulsed real photon beam by detecting a charged fragment with a nearly 4@xmath1 time projection chamber in an event - by - event mode .",
    "the validity of the present new experimental method , including its data analysis , has been accurately confirmed by measuring the photodisintegration cross section of deuteron . by accurately determining the ratio of the @xmath0he(@xmath2,p)@xmath3h to @xmath0he(@xmath2,n)@xmath3he",

    "the @xmath0he(@xmath2,p)@xmath3h , @xmath0he(@xmath2,n)@xmath3he and total cross sections do not agree with the recent calculations based on the lorentz integral transform method .",
    "the @xmath0he(@xmath2,n)@xmath3he cross section follows the shape of the calculation based on the ags method up to 26.5 mev , but it is smaller by about 20% with respect to the calculated values .",
    "we conclude that further theoretical work in the gdr energy region is necessary to elucidate the gdr property of @xmath0he .",
    "concerning the photonuclear reactions of three - nucleon systems , it has been known that 3nf reduces the peak cross section by about 10@xmath420% @xcite .",
    "since @xmath0he is tightly bounded compared to the three - nucleon systems , one might expect significant 3nf effects in the photodisintegration of @xmath0he .",
    "the present result would affect significantly the production yields of r - nuclei by the neutrino - induced r - process nucleosynthesis , since the neutral current neutrino spallation cross sections are quite sensitive to the peak energy of the gdr and the cross section in the gdr energy region .",

    "<S> we have performed for the first time the simultaneous measurement of the two - body and three - body photodisintegration cross - sections of @xmath0he in the energy range from 21.8 to 29.8 mev using monoenergetic pulsed photons and a 4@xmath1 time projection chamber containing @xmath0he gas as an active target in an event - by - event mode . </S>",
    "<S> the photon beam was produced via the compton backscattering of laser photons with high - energy electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0he(@xmath2,p)@xmath3h and @xmath0he(@xmath2,n)@xmath3he cross sections were found to increase monotonically with energy up to 29.8 mev , in contrast to the result of a recent theoretical calculation based on the lorentz integral transform method which predicted a pronounced peak at around 26@xmath427 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the energy dependence of the obtained @xmath0he(@xmath2,n)@xmath3he cross section up to 26.5 mev is marginally consistent with a faddeev - type calculation predicting a flat pattern of the excitation function . </S>",
    "<S> the cross - section ratio of @xmath0he(@xmath2,p)@xmath3h to @xmath0he(@xmath2,n)@xmath3he is found to be consistent with the expected value for charge symmetry of the strong interaction within the experimental uncertainty in the measured energy range . </S>",
    "<S> the present results for the total and two - body cross - sections of the photodisintegration of @xmath0he are compared to previous experimental data and recent theoretical calculations . </S>"
