    "superconducting phase qubits @xcite provide a clear demonstration of quantum coherent behaviour in macroscopic systems .",
    "they also have a very simple design : a phase qubit is a current - biased josephson junction ( see fig . [ scheme](a ) ) , and its working states @xmath2 , @xmath3 in a local minimum of the washboard potential .",
    "the transitions between these levels are produced by applying an rf signal at a resonant frequency @xmath4 .",
    "the readout utilizes the fact that the decay of a metastable state of the system produces an observable reaction : a voltage spike in the junction or a flux change in a coupled dc squid . in the three - level readout scheme ( fig .",
    "[ scheme](b ) ) both @xmath2 and @xmath5 have negligible decay rates . a pulse at a frequency @xmath6 transfers the probability amplitude from the state @xmath5 to the fast - decaying state @xmath7 .",
    "its decay corresponds to a single - shot measurement of the qubit in state latexmath:[$%    apply a dc pulse , which increases the decay rate of @xmath5 .     and",
    "@xmath9 can be used as qubit states.,width=377 ]    one of the effects observed in driven phase qubits is rabi oscillations martinis02 , claudon04 : coherent transitions in a quantum two - level system under the influence of a resonant perturbation , with a much lower frequency dependence on the perturbation amplitude @xmath10 via @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the detuning of the driving frequency @xmath13 from the resonance frequency @xmath0 . in resonance ,",
    "multiphoton rabi oscillations , at @xmath15 ( @xmath16 stands for an integer ) , observed in such qubits @xcite , were also interpreted as a signature of coherence .",
    "the quantum coherent dynamics in phase qubits was tested by several complementary methods ( see , e.g. , refs . [ ] ) .",
    "in particular , in ref . [ ] rabi oscillations between the ground and excited state of the phase qubit were measured by applying a 25 ns pulse at @xmath17 followed by a measurement pulse at @xmath18 . the probability to find the system in the upper state oscillated with the amplitude of the resonant signal , as it should in case of rabi oscillations . in ref .",
    "[ ] rabi oscillations were seen instead as the resonant pulse duration varied ; a dc readout was used .    however , it is known that the quantum mechanical behaviour of a quantum two - level system can still be similar to the dynamical behaviour of the classical non - linear oscillator @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was recently pointed out @xcite that due to the nonlinear behaviour of current - biased josephson junctions , a similar effect can arise in a purely classical way .",
    "though direct tests -  la bell - of whether a given system is quantum or not are possible , even their simplified versions ( e.g. , ref .",
    "[ ] ) are demanding .",
    "this motivated us to further investigate the classical behaviour of a phase qubit and find that there is a possibility to distinguish the quantum rabi oscillations from its classical double , by the shape of the resonance , by the fact that the classical effect can be also produced by the overtones , @xmath19 , of the resonance frequency , and by the sign of the resonant frequency shift .",
    "( an observation that a non - lorentzian shape of the resonance should exclude a classical explanation was made already in ref .",
    "[ ] , where the spectroscopy of two coupled qubits was performed .",
    "also , a symmetric versus asymmetric stark shift in a qubit playing the role of a detector was proposed to distinguish the classical and quantum behaviour of a nanomechanical oscillator @xcite . )",
    "classical and quantum resonances , as a function of applied drives are also studied in ref .",
    "the phase qubit @xcite is a current - biased josephson junction .",
    "the josephson potential , as a function of the phase difference @xmath20,@xmath21forms local minima , in which the quantized metastable levels serve as the working states of the qubit . here",
    "@xmath22 is the critical current of the junction , and @xmath23 is the static bias current . a perturbation can be produced by applying a time - dependent bias current , @xmath24 . in the quantum case , the system can be reduced to a two - level model , described by the hamiltonian @xcite@xmath25where @xmath26 are pauli matrices , @xmath27 is the capacitance of the junction , and @xmath28 in the relevant range of parameters .",
    "one can obtain from here the rabi oscillations ( coherent oscillations of the probability to find the system in the upper / lower state with the frequency @xmath29 ) when excited near the resonance or at its subharmonics ; the shape of the resonance is a symmetric lorentzian , as determined by , e.g. , the average energy of the system versus the driving frequency @xmath13 .    unlike the flux qubit @xcite , where the interlevel distance @xmath30 is determined by the tunneling , here",

    "\\(ii ) the amplitude @xmath54 of the small driven oscillations at the main resonance is @xmath55 .",

    "( [ eq_motion ] ) describes the escape from the phase - locked state , which means the appearance of a non - zero average voltage on the contact .",
    "this voltage is proportional to the average derivative of the phase , @xmath56 .",

    "we note that for the anharmonic driven oscillator , described by eq .",
    "( the_eq ) , both the resonances at @xmath65 and @xmath66 appear due to the anharmonicity of the potential energy and are of the same order . for the driven flux qubit in the classical regime @xcite the equation for the phase variable @xmath67 can also be expanded for small oscillations @xmath68 about the value @xmath69 ; restricting ourselves here to the linear in @xmath70 terms , the equation can be rewritten in the form : @xmath71\\psi = \\epsilon \\sin \\gamma \\tau .",
