    "the vortex lattice is stable and ordered until quantum fluctuations become sufficiently large to melt the lattice ; however , at finite temperature , the lattice lacks long - range order in two dimensions @xcite .    in this paper",

    "we first formulate the basic equations governing the modes for a general density profile , and then show that a uniform system has two elasto - hydrodynamic modes : a gapped sound mode ( referrred to as an inertial mode in @xcite ) , whose frequency is relatively isotropic ; and a tkachenko mode , whose frequency , @xmath0 , depends strongly on the direction of propagation . as we find , @xmath0 is quadratic at long wavelengths only in the transverse plane . for given @xmath1",

    "the vortex arrays are ordered . however , as we argue on the basis of the lindemann criterion , with reasonable decreases in particle numbers and increases in rotation rates and temperature , thermal melting of the vortex lattice could be observable .",
    "unlike in the case of quantum melting of the lattice at zero temperature @xcite where the system makes a transition eventually to a highly correlated state , thermally induced melting is classical in nature . since the system is quasi - two dimensional , we expect the melting to be defect - mediated @xcite , accompanied by observable dislocations leading to a disordered array of vortices .",
