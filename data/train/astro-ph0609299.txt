    "while this is an arbitrary choice , the resulting absorption spectrum is in accordance with the lack of emission features seen in the rest of the spectrum .",
    "given the carbon - rich nature of the gas and the lack of broad emission features in the spectrum ( such as pahs ) , it is reasonable to assume that amorphous carbon grains dominate the dust mixture .",
    "the dust continuum in figure[lr_f ] is featureless and peaks at 15.5 @xmath0 m , implying that the bulk of the emitting dust is at 330k . for the remainder of this paper",

    "these are the unresolved @xmath12 branches of various ro - vibrational bands from different molecules , many of which can be identified by comparison to afgl  618 as due to acetylene ( c@xmath2h@xmath2 , 13.70@xmath0 m ) , di - acetylene ( c@xmath1h@xmath2 , 15.87@xmath0 m ) , tri - acetylene ( c@xmath3h@xmath2 , 16.10@xmath0 m ) , benzene ( c@xmath3h@xmath3 , 14.85@xmath0 m ) and hc@xmath9n ( 15.10@xmath0 m ) .",

    "the strongest @xmath12 branch is the one due to c@xmath2h@xmath2 at 13.7@xmath0 m .",
    "close inspection of the spectrum indicates the presence not only of the fundamental @xmath13 mode , but also of hot bands and combination bands . the broad absorption is the result of the superposition of the many @xmath14- and @xmath15-branch lines that correspond to these @xmath12 branches , which indicates that the column densities of these species must be high .",
    "smp  lmc  11 presents a weaker tri - acetylene band compared to afgl  618 , but in contrast shows a stronger benzene band .",
    "ammonia ( nh@xmath9 , with the strongest bands at 10.35 , 10.75 , and 6.15@xmath0 m ) and hcn ( at 14.01@xmath0 m ) are at most marginally present .",
    "by contrast stronger ro - vibrational bands of hcn are present in afgl  618 and in the extreme carbon star irc+10216 @xcite .",
    "figure[lr_f ] shows that the spectrum also exhibits an absorption dip near 10@xmath0 m .",
    "such a dip is also seen by @xcite in their sample of carbon stars .",
    "they attribute this feature to c@xmath9 ; however , this identification is still a matter of debate ( e.g. speck et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the spectrum of smp  lmc  11 shows features which are not seen in afgl  618 at 10.53 , 11.15 , and 15.78@xmath0 m .",
    "the feature at 10.53@xmath0 m corresponds to the @xmath12-branch of the @xmath16 ch@xmath2-wagging mode of c@xmath2h@xmath1 ( ethylene ) . in the _ spitzer _ wavelength range ,",
    "the only other mode of this molecule that would be expected is the strong scissoring mode at 6.93@xmath0 m ; the rocking mode at 12.10@xmath0 m is expected to be weak .",
    "there is indeed a feature around 6.93 @xmath0 m in the low - resolution spectrum ( figure[lr_f ] ) .",
    "ch@xmath9c@xmath2h , also known as propyne or methylacetylene , has its strongest band at 15.79@xmath0 m with medium - strength bands at 6.84 and 7.97@xmath0 m , and the spectrum of smp  lmc  11 shows bands at both of those wavelengths ( see figure1 ) .",
    "therefore propyne may be a good candidate for the 15.78@xmath0 m band .",
    "however , the absorption from 6.3 to 8.3@xmath0 m in figure1 ( bottom panel ) can also be due to the c@xmath2h@xmath2 @xmath17+@xmath13 bands , which have been identified by @xcite in a sample of lmc agb stars . with the latter identification",
    "the 8.0@xmath0 m feature could be ascribed to the c@xmath1h@xmath2 @xmath18+@xmath19 band .",
    "the blue shoulder of this band in our spectrum may be due to hcn .",
    "@xcite noted that the two absorption bands from c@xmath2h@xmath2 at 7.5 and 13.7@xmath0 m are decoupled in their sample of carbons stars in the smc .",
    "thus we can not use the lack of a 14.0@xmath0 m band from hcn to rule out a contribution of hcn at 7.1@xmath0 m .",
    "ch@xmath9 at 7.2@xmath0 m and ch@xmath1 at 7.7@xmath0 m have been seen in afgl  618 @xcite and in titan s atmosphere @xcite , and they could also be contributing to this band in smp  lmc  11 .",
    "a firm identification of these bands will require higher resolution observations , especially from the ground and _ jwst _ , complemented with a detailed comparison with laboratory measurements .",
    "besides the absorption features mentioned above , the spectrum of smp  lmc  11 shows no traces of the mgs feature ( @xmath2030 @xmath0 m ) which is commonly seen in carbon stars with optically thick dust shells and on some pne .",
    "in addition to the absorption features , the high - resolution spectrum of smp  lmc  11 clearly shows emission from at 12.8 . the line ( 15.5 ) may be present but the presence of another line at 15.65@xmath0 m which may be a glitch makes the identification of the more doubtful .",
    "the presence of the low - excitation line of is consistent with the optical measurements by @xcite and @xcite of the low - excitation lines of , , and .",
    "the infrared spectrum of smp  lmc  11 reveals three components : a cool dust continuum , absorption bands from hydrocarbon molecules , and emission from at least one low - ionization forbidden line .",
    "the mean temperature of the dust as inferred from the peak of the ir emission ( @xmath20330  k ) falls closer to the most evolved agb stars ( t@xmath21300  k ) than the youngest pne ( t@xmath20150  k ) @xcite .",
    "the peak of the dust emission will shift to longer wavelengths as dust moves further away from the central star .",
    "the _ spitzer _ spectrum of smp  lmc  11 represents the first extragalactic detection of several molecules , including di - acetylene ( c@xmath1h@xmath2 ) , tri - acetylene ( c@xmath1h@xmath2 ) , benzene ( c@xmath3h@xmath3 ) , hc@xmath9n , c@xmath2h@xmath1 , and possibly propyne .",
    "these molecules are the building blocks from which more complex hydrocarbons are produced .",
    "the absorption bands are due to the increase in thickness of the circumstellar shell , which is more dramatic at the very end of the agb phase @xcite . for free molecules",
    ", this absorption will not be a gaussian or a lorentzian , but will be a complex addition of many individual ro - vibrational lines with different strengths ( which depend on the temperature ) , causing the strong absorption we see in the 12 - 17@xmath0 m region ( due to the p and r branches of the molecules present in that region ) .",
    "the stronger absorption in this region compared to afgl  618 indicates that smp  lmc  11 has a larger molecular column density .",
    "the spectrum of smp  lmc  11 does not contain any pah emission features . a mixture of pahs and the pah - precursor c@xmath2h@xmath2 are seen together in the low - resolution irs spectrum of the post - agb object msx smc029 @xcite .",
    "the absence of pah emission in smp  lmc  11 can be attributed to age or orientation effects .",
    "@xcite propose that pahs may not form until the end of the agb phase , based on their observations of afgl 618 . alternatively ,",
    "the dust in smp  lmc  11 could be distributed in an edge - on torus while msx smc029 is seen more pole - on or has a more spherically symmetric dust distribution .",
    "the pahs emit in photo - dissociation regions , and in an edge - on torus , we would not have a clear line of sight to the emitting region .",
    "the dust envelope is still too thick to allow a direct line of sight into the hotter central regions .    despite the detection of hc@xmath9n ( and perhaps hc@xmath22n ) , the spectrum of smp  lmc  11 shows evidence for reduced abundances of nitrogen - based molecules such as hcn and nh@xmath9 compared to galactic objects like afgl  618 .",
    "this agrees with the nitrogen abundance derived by @xcite for smp  lmc  11 ( @xmath23 ) which is one of the lowest in their sample of lmc pne .",
    "this result fits with the finding of @xcite that the hcn bands that are prominent in the galactic sample of carbon stars are significantly weaker or absent in the lmc sample .",
    "the lower nitrogen abundance in the lmc compared to the galaxy and higher efficiency of the third dredge - up at lower metallicities work together to decrease the nitrogen abundance relative to carbon .",
    "the presence of an optically thick and relatively warm dust component between us and the central ionized region can explain not only the absence of pah features , but also the absence of most ionized lines in the infrared .",
    "we only see [ ne ii ] ( and maybe ) , and this line is probably visible only in scattered light .",
    "scattering is more efficient in the optical than in the infrared , which would explain why more of the forbidden lines can be detected in the optical .",
    "the dust also explains the presence of molecular absorption in the spectrum , since the molecules do not have a direct line of sight to the still shielded central ionized region .",
    "it is also possible that some of the forbidden line emission is excited by high - velocity ( v@xmath24100 km s@xmath7 ) shocks @xcite .",
    "all of these properties are more consistent an object which is in transition from the agb to a pn than with a classic pn .",
    "the bright h@xmath4 luminosity and its large size , present some problems with this scenario of a transition object . while the measured h@xmath4 flux by @xcite makes smp  lmc  11 one of the faintest pne in their lmc sample , its equivalent flux at 1 kpc ( if we assume that it is at a distance of 50 kpc ) is log(h@xmath4)=@xmath510.55 , which is bright for galactic standards . similarly , @xcite state that it is one of the smallest bipolar nebulae in their lmc sample , but at a galactic distance of 1 kpc it would be resolved .",
    "these characteristics resemble those of a typical pn . one could invoke then a massive molecular envelope surrounding the ionized region to explain the absorption features .",
    "still , the absence of pahs and h@xmath2 in the spectrum , and the high temperature of the dust ( compared to pne ) would remain unexplained ( unless perhaps invoking a complex geometry ) .",
    "the rich chemistry seen in the irs spectrum of smp  lmc  11 makes it ( together with afgl  618 , and msx smc029 ) a key object in our understanding of the formation of hydrocarbons , deserving future study from the community .",
    "particularly , co measurements of the circumstellar agb envelope may prove to be particularly useful .",
    "we would like to thank richard shaw for sharing his results prior to publication , and the referee , whose diligence led to substantial improvements in the manuscript .",
    "this work is based on observations made with the spitzer space telescope , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under nasa contract 1407 .",
