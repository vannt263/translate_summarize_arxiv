    "measurement of spin polarization is an important subject in spintronics .",
    "the point - contact andreev reflection ( pcar ) technique has been widely used as a simple and powerful method in the determination of conduction electron spin polarization in a broad range of ferromagnets@xcite .",
    "the principle behind the spin polarization measurement by the pcar spectroscopy is based on the fact that the andreev reflection@xcite probability at a ferromagnet - superconductor interface is limited by the minority spin carrier density at the fermi level in the ferromagnet . in the limit of a clean ballistic ferromagnet - superconductor contact , the spin polarization @xmath0 is simply determined by the ratio @xmath1 of the conductances @xmath2 and @xmath3 at zero and high bias voltage , respectively , which was obtained by decomposing the current into a fully polarized part and a fully unpolarized part.@xcite however , for real ferromagnet - superconductor contacts , which are generally not in the clean limit , accurate determination of @xmath0 is nontrivial and usually requires a careful analysis of the complete conductance - voltage ( @xmath4 ) curve.@xcite blonder _",
    "@xcite developed a theory ( known as the btk model ) that takes into account the andreev reflection , for the experimental @xmath4 curves of normal metal - superconductor contacts with different behaviors ranging from metallic to tunnel junction .",
    "later , strijkers _",
    "_ @xcite extended the btk model to a ferromagnet - superconductor contact by including the effects of the spin polarization in the ferromagnet .",
    "the extended btk model of strijkers _ et al .",
    "_ has been applied to analyze the @xmath4 curves of many ferromagnet - superconductor contacts and also to determine the spin polarization in the ferromagnets in the contacts.@xcite in addition to the original one - dimensional ( 1-d ) btk model@xcite and the extended 1-d btk model@xcite , several extended three - dimensional ( 3-d ) btk models for both ballistic and diffusive regimes have also been proposed.@xcite    interestingly , anomalous phenomena such as the dip structures @xcite , the zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) @xcite , and the large zero - bias enhancement @xcite , may appear in the pcar spectra of a wide variety of point contact systems .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "1(a ) shows that unexpected dips emerge when the bias voltage @xmath5 approaches the superconducting energy gap @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , a narrow peak occurs at @xmath7 ( known as the zbcp ) , as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the large zero - bias enhancement may result in the normalized zero - bias conductance being larger than 2.0 [ see fig .",
    "these characteristics can not be explained by the above - mentioned extended btk models @xcite and thus other effects must be taken into account .",

    "for example , strijkers _",
    "et al._@xcite investigated the dip structures by introducing an additional proximity - induced superconducting energy gap . on the other hand ,",
    "intergrain josephson effect@xcite and maxwell resistance@xcite were also regarded as possible sources of both dips and large zero - bias enhancement .",
    "schmidt _ et al._@xcite proposed formation of superconductor - insulator - superconductor ( sis ) junctions that would result in the zbcp .",
    "indeed , the geometry of a point contact may lead to the formation of a sis junction .",
    "however , the zbcp also appears in planar superconductor - insulator - normal metal ( sin ) junctions@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the zbcp was explained by multiple phase - coherent reflections and proximity - induced josephson effect .",
    "however , this explanation is inapplicable for the material with large exchange splitting .",
    "furthermore , the authors did not provide any model to fit their experimental data .",
    "interestingly , the andreev bound states@xcite have also been considered as a source of the zpcp .",
    "a recent theoretical work further showed that an andreev bound state could be viewed as a topological edge state@xcite .",
    "however , an andreev bound state stems from the unconventional pairing symmetry and thus would not occur in s - wave superconductors .",
    "therefore , the origins of the dip structures , zero - bias enhancement , and zbcp are still not fully understood .",
    "in addition to the above - mentioned anomalous features , for some experimental data , the value of the fitted model parameters for the extended btk model of strijkers _ et al._@xcite , e.g. , @xmath6 , is much larger than the well - known value .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "1(d ) , the energy gap of pb is 1.35 mev , whereas the fitted value is 1.93 mev .",
    "such pcar spectra which exhibit a broadened energy gap , are called broadened spectra .",
    "however , two plausible mechanisms : thermal effects@xcite and a spreading resistance@xcite , have been proposed to explain the broadened spectra .    in this paper , we investigate the transport mechanism of a ferromagnet - superconductor interface and develop a modified btk model to better describe the physics at the interface and account for anomalous pcar spectra .",
    "we solve a 3-d bogolubov de - gennes equations , assuming no scattering along the transverse direction .",
    "we find that evanescent waves form for the large - angle incidence .",
    "we point out that these evanescent waves might lead to charge inhomogeneity and an electric dipole layer occurs at the interface . furthermore , we take the effect of charge inhomogeneity into account by modifying the barrier strength @xmath12 .",
    "interestingly , by doing that , we establish a new 3-d btk model which can describe the anomalous conductance spectra with dip structures , a zero - bias conductance peak , and large zero - bias enhancement .",
    "in other words , we show that all anomalous conductance spectra have the same origin : transport induced charge inhomogeneity .",
    "we also discuss the temperature - dependence of the dip structures .",
    "futhermore , we fit the experimental results using this new model including the effect of spreading resistance .",

    "however , this assumption was not based on any physical argument and may be invalid . from the above calculation , we find that evanescent waves form for the large - angle incidence .",
    "therefore , the likely influence of evanescent states on the barrier potential of the interface should be considered .",
    "the evanescent wave represents the spatially inhomogeneous distribution of particles .",
    "hole and quasiparticles carry charges .",
    "this implies that charge may not spread uniformly and could be localized near the interface instead .",
    "this charge inhomogeneity would affect the transport of other incident electrons via electrostatic interaction .    in the evanescent andreev reflection process",
    ", the incident electron near the interface would take another electron away from the ferromagnet to the superconductor , and an evanescent hole is therefore left in the ferromagnet .",
    "the movement of a hole in one direction implies the movement of an electron in the opposite direction .",
    "the evanescent andreev reflected hole does not carry any current .",
    "that is , the removed electron does not travel either after it is transferred into the superconductor .",
    "therefore , via the evanescent andreev reflection , positive charges would prefer to reside on the ferromagnetic side of interface .",
    "conversely , negative charges would be localized on the superconducting side of the interface . hence , an electric dipole layer forms , as shown in fig .",
    "similarly , electric dipole layer could also occur via the evanescent quasiparticle transmission because the charges of incident electrons are transferred into the superconductor via the formation of decaying quasiparticles and localized positive charges appear in the ferromagnet near the interface .",
    "the related study on dipole layer at metal - superconductor interface was conducted in ref . @xcite .",
    "in addition , as shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) , evanescent transport happens at larger incident angles .",
    "furthermore , in fig .",
    "2(c ) , an electron at the black circle may be incident at the ferromagnet - superconductor interface along various directions . however , the maximum possible incident angle is limited by contact area .",
    "for example , the contact area @xmath85 is larger than @xmath86 and hence the maximum possible incident angle @xmath87 .",
    "the maximum possible incident angle increases with contact area .",
    "therefore , we can infer that the effect of electric dipole layer would be more striking when the contact area is larger .",
    "the electrostatic potential due to an electric dipole layer may be written in the form@xcite @xmath88 here , @xmath89 is the surface dipole moment density and @xmath90 is the direction of dipole moment of the layer . obviously , the electrostatic potential decreases with the distance between the observer and dipole layer , and becomes quite strong when the observer is very close to the dipole layer .",
    "the electric dipole layer due to charge transfer at the ferromagnet - superconductor interface should display the similar behavior and hence has a maximum in the vicinity of the interface .",
    "furthermore , taking into account screening effect , the range of the potential could be finite . in metals ,",
    "the screening length is about a few angstroms .",
    "therefore , it would be reasonable to model the screened short - range electrostatic potential as a @xmath91-function . using the definition of the charge density @xmath92 in ref .",
    "@xcite , we find that the charge density of an evanescent hole is proportional to @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , the barrier potential due to the contribution of an evanescent andreev reflection is linear in @xmath93 .",
    "however , the strength of barrier potential is difficult to determine , because the @xmath91-function is unphysical in reality@xcite and merely for the purpose of mathematical simplification .",
    "therefore , we set the strength of barrier potential equal to @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is an undetermined constant .",
    "we use the similar method to model the barrier potential due to evanescent quasiparticles transmission .",
    "furthermore , using eq .",
    "( 6 ) , we can find that the electrostatic potential energy for incident electrons due to these evanescent states is negative .",
    "because @xmath61 in the region iii is found to be @xmath33 , the barrier potential is modified as @xmath96 .",
    "we can derive the modified barrier strength @xmath97 here , @xmath98 is related to the scattering due to the contact potential , impurity , and tunneling barrier at the interface , as the previous btk defined .",
    "@xmath99 is the barrier strength that the evanescent andreev reflection contributes .",
    "@xmath100 is caused by the coulomb potential due to the evanescent quasiparticles transmission .",
    "we assume that the localized charges affect only the transport of the incident spin - up electrons in region i and the incident spin - down electrons . in other words , we neglect the influence the localized states in regions ii and iii on the transport of each other .",
    "the barrier potential for the spin - up incident electrons in regions ii and iii is not altered by the charge inhomogeneity .",

    "3(a ) that when the effect of charge inhomogeneity are not taken into account ( i.e. , @xmath127 and @xmath128 ) , the normalized conductance at low bias decreases with increasing barrier strength @xmath98 and two peaks appear symmetrically about zero bias , like the previous btk models@xcite . this was already attributed to the suppression of andreev reflection by the barrier strength@xcite . in fig .",
    "3(b ) , it is shown how the evanescent andreev reflection [ through barrier strength ( i.e. @xmath129 ) ] affect the conductance spectra .",
    "clearly , the low - bias conductance would increase initially , with increasing @xmath99 , as shown by the curves with @xmath130 and @xmath131 , but , however , would decrease upon further increasing @xmath99 . from eq .",
    "( 7 ) , we can infer that @xmath99 would reduce the effective barrier strength @xmath101 and hence increases the low - bias conductance . however , if @xmath99 is large , the effective barrier strength becomes negative .",
    "the negative potential barrier implies a potential well rather than a potential barrier .",
    "when the effective barrier strength becomes negative , the depth of the well increases with increasing @xmath99 and hence the conductance would be reduced by @xmath99 . moreover , when the conductance increases with @xmath99 ( i.e. the curves for @xmath132 and @xmath133 ) , the dip at the zero - bias would diminish gradually and eventually a single peak occurs at zero bias ( see the curve for @xmath131 ) .",
    "the shape of conductance spectra for @xmath131 is similar to that of the curve in the clean regime ( i.e. the curve for @xmath134 , shown in fig .",
    "however , in comparison with the curves with no barrier , the height of the peak for @xmath131 is higher .",
    "the heights of peaks for @xmath131 and for no barrier are 1.81 and 1.67 , respectively .",
    "in addition , we find that the peak for @xmath131 is sharper .",
    "we also notice that @xmath99 can generate double dips , like the curves for @xmath135 and @xmath136 .    in fig .",
    "3(c ) , the effect of the evanescent - quasiparticle - induced barrier strength @xmath100 is shown .",
    "in contrast with @xmath99 , @xmath100 would reduce the low - bias conductance first and then raise it .",
    "it is clear from table i that the coefficient @xmath137 for @xmath82 and the @xmath78 approaches zero at high energy .",
    "therefore , @xmath3 is insensitive to @xmath99 but may be influenced by @xmath100 .",
    "similar to @xmath99 , for smaller @xmath100 , @xmath100 reduces the height of the barrier at high bias and hence @xmath3 increases and the low - bias normalized conductance decreases . for sufficiently large @xmath100",
    ", a barrier is transformed into a well and @xmath3 decreases with @xmath100 .",
    "hence , the normalized conductance could be enhanced by increasing @xmath100 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath100 could raise zero - bias conductance above 2 ( see the curve for @xmath138 ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , under the effect of charge inhomogeneity , the zero - bias normalized conductance does not reach its maximum in the clean limit .",
    "indeed , the transmission of electrons into the superconductor should be obstructed by a barrier ( or a well ) especially upon andreev reflection , as shown in fig .",
    "furthermore , at high bias , electrons propagate into the superconductor mainly through electron- and hole- like transmission and hence @xmath3 is independent of andreev reflection probability",
    ". therefore , the zero - bias conductance @xmath139 must decrease if @xmath12 is a constant .",
    "when @xmath99 and @xmath100 are included , the total barrier strength varies with voltage .",
    "electrons may feel a higher barrier or a deeper well at high bias and therefore normalized conductance could increase in the presence of a barrier or a well .          from the preceding section",
    ", we may conclude that the evanescent - hole - induced barrier strength @xmath99 could lead to zero - bias enhancement , sharp central peak , occurrence of dips while the evanescent - quasiparticle - induced barrier strength @xmath100 could substantially enhance the zero - bias conductance . by applying @xmath99 and @xmath100",
    ", we can create the anomalous pcar spectra for different spin polarizations , which are very similar to experimental observations , as shown in fig .",

    "the dips occur at @xmath141 mv in the present case . in the presence of the spreading resistance",
    ", the dips would move farther away from the central peak .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental observations .",
    "4(b ) and ( c ) show two different types of the zbcp spectra . in fig .",
    "4(b ) , a higher conductance peak is located at zero bias and two small peaks appear symmetrically on both side of it , similar to the experimental results in ref . @xcite . in fig .",
    "4(c ) , a zero - bias shallow hump appears at tunneling - like andreev reflection spectra , similar to the experimental results in refs .",
    "the two zbcp characteristics can both be obtained by adjusting @xmath99 , as shown in the curves for @xmath142 and @xmath143 of fig .",
    "our results indicate that both dip structures and a zbcp are due to the evanescent andreev reflection . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was showed that the dip structures in the andreev spectra [ like fig .",
    "4(a ) ] could be transformed into the zbcp [ like fig .",
    "4(b ) ] by varying contact area , which is consistent with our results . adjusting contact area could alter the properties of interface , @xmath144 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 and hence different types of the pcar spectra would occur .",
    "4(d ) shows both the dip structures and large zero - bias enhancement . in experiments ,",
    "the dip structures are often accompanied by the large zero - bias enhancement@xcite .",
    "our model can reproduce both the dip structures and large zero - bias enhancement .",
    "in addition , we find from fig .",
    "3(b ) that the dips appear when @xmath99 reduces the zero - bias conductance .",
    "this indicates that the unusual zero - bias enhancement results from @xmath100 . in experiments , the dip structures ,",
    "a zbcp , and large zero - bias enhancement usually happen at large contact area ( i.e. low resistance ) .",
    "charge inhomgeneity is also pronounced for large contact area , as seen in fig .",
    "this supports the validity of our model .",
    "however , it should be noted that the increase of conductance with contact area is due to the increase of electron - transport channels instead of @xmath99 or @xmath100 . in the preceding subsection ,",
    "it was illustrated how @xmath100 reduces @xmath3 and @xmath145 under the assumption of constant electron - transport channels . in principle",
    ", the charge inhomogeneity could also happen for the planar geometry .",
    "therefore , our model could also be extended to the planar junctions .",
    "let us now examine how the dip structures vary with temperature .",
    "the superconducting energy gap decreases with increasing temperature@xcite .",
    "we plot the normalized conductance for different values of temperature and energy gap in fig .",
    "5(a ) and fig .",
    "5(b ) , respectively . fig .",
    "5(a ) indicates that the dips would be reduced gradually and also move away from the central peak as @xmath126 increases .",
    "5(b ) shows that , with decreasing @xmath6 , the dips would diminish gradually , too , but move towards the central peak .",
    "we can infer that the dips would disappear eventually when the temperature is raised .",
    "moreover , from fig . 2 - 2 in ref .",
    "@xcite , near @xmath146 , the energy gap is almost insensitive to @xmath126 .",
    "if @xmath126 is larger , @xmath6 would decrease with @xmath126 more rapidly .",
    "when @xmath126 is increased up to the critical temperature @xmath147 , @xmath6 drops to zero . in other words , we predict that , with the temperature rising , the position of a dip should increase if temperature is low enough .",
    "conversely , at higher temperatures , due to the rapid decrease of @xmath6 , the position of a dip could decrease with increasing temperature .",
    "5(c ) shows the measured temperature dependence of the dips for a fe / nb point contact@xcite , which should correspond to the theoretical results in fig .",
    "many other experimental works have shown the same temperature dependence of dip structures for a wide variety of combinations between metals and superconductors@xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was pointed out in the preceding subsection that dip structures and the zbcp have the same physical origin .",
    "therefore , indeed , the two local minima in the zbcp spectra would be equivalent to the dip structures .",
    "_ @xcite observed zbcp spectra in the temperature range of @xmath148k .",
    "their data showed the two local minima in the conductance spectra moved to higher bias as temperature increased .",
    "therefore , we infer that the dips may also move away from the central peak , as shown in fig",

    "fe@xmath9/pb point contacts measured at 4.2k ( black circles ) with contact resistance of ( a ) @xmath149 @xmath150 and ( b ) @xmath151 @xmath150 .",
    "the solid ( red ) and dashed ( blue ) lines are the fits using our model ( see sec .",
    "ii ) and the extended btk model@xcite , respectively .",
    "the fit value of temperature is fixed at 4.2 k.,width=264 ]      we performed the least squared fit to selected experimental data using our model and compared with the extended btk model.@xcite in addition to the @xmath0 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , which are necessary in our model , @xmath6 , @xmath126 , and the extra resistance factor @xmath113 in eq .",
    "( 9 ) can also be used as fitting parameters to the experimental spectra . to minimize the fitting parameters ,",
    "we chose to fit the measurements obtained from samples immersed in liquid helium and fixed the temperature @xmath152 k. at first , superconducting energy gap @xmath6 for pb was fixed at 1.23 mev and the @xmath113 was fixed at zero . if the fitting result was not satisfactory , we would turn on @xmath6 and/or @xmath113 as fitting parameters .",
    "we find that , for small contact resistance ( @xmath149 @xmath150 ) , a zero - bias conductance peak could appear in the experimental curve [ fig .",
    "6(a ) ] . however , for large contact resistance ( @xmath151 @xmath150 ) , we do not observe the zbcp and an ordinary pcar spectrum occurs , as shown in fig . 6(b ) .",
    "we also find from fig .",
    "6(a ) that , in contrast to the extended btk model@xcite which could not reproduce the shoulder structures , our model could fit the zbcp spectrum very well . fig .",
    "6(b ) shows that our model also fits usual spectra well .",
    "although the usual spectra could be fitted by the extended btk model@xcite well , the resultant parameter @xmath153 is significantly smaller than that from the previous measurements@xcite .",
    "the spin polarization of permalloy has been determined by both pcar@xcite and spin - polarized tunneling@xcite experiments , and was found to be in the range of 0.3 - 0.5 . in our model",
    ", the fitted value of @xmath154 agrees well with these previous measurements .",
    "this indicates that , in our measurements , charge inhomogeneity may happen and , therefore , the extended btk model could not explain the experimental data in fig .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed a modified 3-d btk model by taking into account the effect of transport induced charge inhomogeneity on the barrier potential at ferromagnet - superconductor interfaces . to this end , we add two new parameters , namely , the evanescent hole - induced barrier strength @xmath99 and evanescent quasiparticle - induced barrier strength @xmath100 to describe the modified barrier strength . we find that @xmath99 would give rise to the dip structures and zero - bias conductance peak , while , on the other hand , @xmath100 would enhance the zero - bias conductance by decreasing the normal - state conductance @xmath3 .",
    "we have , therefore , offered a possible explanation for the anomalous conductance spectra which have been long standing problems in the field of pcar spectroscopy .",
    "furthermore , the results of our model fits to the experimental data have a good agreement with the measured zbcp spectra as well as normal conductance spectra . nevertheless , the standard @xmath91-function form adopted here for the barrier potential at point contacts could be an oversimplication .",
    "further theoretical and experimental works are certainly needed to fully understand these important issues in the pcar spectroscopy .",
