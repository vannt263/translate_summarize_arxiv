    "the origin of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) has been highly unknown in spite of prolonged effort to construct larger uhecr observatories and to detect more events @xcite . in cosmic ray spectrum ,",
    "a sharply spectral steepening at around @xmath5ev has been predicted theoretically by interactions with photopion production with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons , known as greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) steepening @xcite .",
    "the feature of this steepening observed by the high resolution fly s eye ( hires ) @xcite and the pierre auger observatory ( pao ) @xcite implies that astrophysical sources are much more dominant than top - down sources ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) at the highest energies , though physical reasons for the extension of the energy spectrum beyond the gzk energies reported by the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) have been not understood yet @xcite .",
    "several objects to accelerate particles up to @xmath5 ev have been suggested , but there has been little observational evidence which is a uhecr source ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "the arrival distribution of uhecrs has information on the distribution of their sources , also including that on intergalactic and the galactic magnetic field ( igmf and gmf ) .",
    "the agasa and pao reported statistically significant anisotropy at small angular scale in the arrival distribution @xcite .",
    "the small - scale anisotropy implies point - like sources , and enables us to constrain the number of nearby uhecr sources .",
    "the source number density , @xmath6 , is one of important parameters to investigate the nature of uhecr sources . comparing the estimated number density with the number densities of known astrophysical objects",
    ", we can constrain the object - type of uhecr sources .",
    "several authors have estimated as @xmath7-@xmath8 using the published agasa data above @xmath9 ev assuming the same injection rate over all sources @xcite , and we also constrained the source number density as @xmath10 , assuming a model that the injection rate is proportional to the luminosity of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the pao reported the correlation between the arrival directions of uhecr above @xmath11 ev and the positions of nearby active galactic nuclei ( agns ) listed in the 12th veron - cetty & veron catalog @xcite within the angular scale of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "however , most of the pao - correlated agns are seyfert galaxies and liners , which have much weaker activity than radio - loud agns like fanaroff - reily ii ( fr ii ) galaxies @xcite . to understand whether these galaxies with weak activity are really uhecr sources or not , another information on uhecr sources is required .",
    "the pao estimated a lower limit of the uhecr source number as 61 based on anisotropy in the arrival distribution of their detected events , simply assuming poisson statistics and not taking into account uhecr propagation @xcite .",
    "this is certainly a lower limit of the number of the sources , but is not quantity which can be compared with astronomical observables because we do not know what radius they are included in .",
    "their number density is an observable .",
    "taking into account uhecr propagation , we can also estimate plausible value of it , not _",
    "limit_.    in this study , we simulate the arrival distribution of uhecrs above @xmath0 ev , taking into account their propagation process in intergalactic and the galactic space .",
    "we extract an anisotropy signal from the simulated arrival distribution and then compare this signal with that observed by the pao above @xmath11 ev to estimate the source number density .",
    "the reports for the correlation by the pao with nearby large - scale structure @xcite show that it plays a crucial role on the arrival distribution of uhecrs .",
    "thus , we adopt the models of the igmf and source distribution which reproduce the local structure actually observed around the milky way , developed in our previous work @xcite",
    ". we also discuss the isotropy in the arrival distribution at @xmath4 ev and estimate the source number density for the lower energies .",
    "the composition is assumed to be pure protons .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [ methods ] , our calculation method for calculating uhecr arrival distribution and a statistical method to estimate the source number density are explained . in section",
    "[ results ] , the calculation results are shown and we discuss the results and conclude in section [ discussion ] .",
    "we estimate the number density of uhecr sources as follows .",
    "first , we calculate arrival distributions of uhe protons based on our source models with several number densities .",
    "their propagation process in intergalactic and the galactic space is taken into account .",
    "the number of simulated protons and the threshold of their energies are set to the same as those detected by the pao .",
    "next , auto - correlation functions , which are an indicator of small - scale anisotropy in the arrival distribution , are calculated from our simulated events . finally , comparing these auto - correlation functions with that calculated from the observed events , we find the best - fit value of the source number density .",
    "we calculate the arrival distribution of uhe protons by a method used in ref .",
    "a characteristic of this method is to adopt a structured igmf model which reproduces the observed structure in local universe , developed in ref .",
    "the strength of the igmf is normalized at the center of virgo cluster as @xmath13 and @xmath14 g .",
    "this method also enables us to take account of the deflection by gmf . a gmf model with bisymmetric spiral structure proposed by ref .",
    "@xcite and the same model parameters as ref .",
    "@xcite is adopted .",
    "the maximum distance of uhecr sources is set to 1gpc , which is comparable with the energy - loss length of bethe - heitler pair creation with the cmb .",
    "this is sufficient to consider cosmic rays down to @xmath0 ev .",
    "there are two improvements for this study .",
    "one is the angular resolution of uhecr experiments . in ref .",
    "@xcite , since we consider the agasa data , we adopt the angular resolution of @xmath15 . in this study , @xmath16 is adopted for the pao events , which corresponds to the angular resolution of the pao @xcite .",
    "the other is to take the non - uniformity of the exposure of ground array into account .",
    "the exposure of ground array is not uniform because of the daily rotation of the earth .",
    "since the variation in right ascension in a day can be neglected @xcite , the dependence of the exposure is simply written as a function of the declination of arriving cosmic rays , @xmath17 , @xcite , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 and @xmath21 here , @xmath22 is detector s terrestrial latitude , and @xmath23 is the maximum zenith angle for the experimental cut . for the pao , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are adopted @xcite .    in this study , we adopt two source models .",
    "both models are constructed from _ infrared astronomical satellite point source redshift survey _ ( _ iras _ pscz ) catalog of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the iras catalog consists of 14,677 galaxies above 0.6 jy with redshift and it sky coverage is 84% .",
    "so it is the best catalog to reflect the local large - scale structure .",
    "we correct the selection effect and galaxies in 16% of unobserved area using the luminosity function estimated by ref .",
    "@xcite , and then regard subsets of the corrected iras galaxies as uhecr source distributions . each galaxy is adopted as a source with the probability proportional to its luminosity . we perform the source selection 100 times for every @xmath6 .",
    "one of the models is a source model with the same cosmic ray injection rate over all sources ( called _ model a _ below ) , and the other is with the injection rate proportional to infrared luminosities of galaxies ( called _ model b _ below ) .",
    "the maximum acceleration energy of protons is not dependent on luminosities of the sources .",
    "this corrected catalog is also used for the construction of our igmf model .",
    "auto - correlation function is one of good indicators of small - scale anisotropy of uhecr arrival distribution .",
    "auto - correlation function is defined as @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the separation angle of a pair of events .",
    "the interval @xmath28 is set to be @xmath16 . in order to investigate the goodness of fit between the auto - correlation functions calculated from simulated events and observed one , we also define @xmath29 as @xmath30 ^ 2 } { { \\sigma(\\theta_n)}^2 } } ,   \\label{eq : chi}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is an average of the auto - correlation function calculated from a source distribution and @xmath32 is the standard deviation of @xmath31 due to the finite number of simulated events .",
    "random event selection is performed 100 times for every source distribution .",
    "@xmath33 is the auto - correlation function calculated from observed data .",
    "@xmath34 is the maximum angular scale to consider the small - scale anisotropy , @xmath35 is the number of angular bins .",
    "we estimate uhecr source number density using an anisotropy signal in the 27 events published by the pao whose energies are above @xmath11 ev @xcite .",
    "first , we check the anisotropy signal .",
    "[ fig : acor ] shows auto - correlation function calculated from the 27 events ( _ histogram _ ) . the auto - correlation function predicted from random distribution weighted by the exposure of the pao",
    "is also shown .",
    "the error bars are the standard deviations due to the finite number of events .",
    "the event realization is performed 1000 times .",
    "we can see statistically significant anisotropy at small angular scale against isotropic distribution .",
    "we set @xmath36 in eq .",
    "[ eq : chi ] to extract the small - scale anisotropy .",
    "if @xmath37 is adopted , main results below are unchanged .",
    "next , we calculate auto - correlation functions from our simulated arrival distributions of uhe protons , which are compared with the histogram in fig . [",
    "fig : acor ] to investigate the number density of the sources which can best reproduce the small - scale anisotropy observed by the pao .",
    "if @xmath6 is extremely small , strong anisotropy is expected because only few sources can contribute to the arriving cosmic rays . on the other hand , in the case of much many sources ,",
    "the arrival distribution is expected to be close to isotropy .",
    "thus , there should be the best - fit value of the number density .",
    "[ fig : chi ] shows @xmath38 calculated for the different number densities of uhecr sources .",
    "the normalization of the igmf strength considered is 0.0 ( _ crosses _ ) , 0.1 ( _ triangles _ ) , 0.4 ( _ squares _ ) , and 1.0 @xmath39 g ( _ pentagons _ ) respectively .",
    "the error bars represents the standard deviation of @xmath38 , which is estimated from 100 realizations of the source distribution .",
    "the plots at the same number density are a little shifted horizontally for visibility .",
    "note that uhecr sources within 5 mpc are artificially neglected in this calculation to reproduce isotropy observed at lower energies ( @xmath4 ev ) .",
    "this point will be discussed in section [ lsi ] .",
    "such nearby sources also predict anisotropy stronger than observed on at the highest energies .    in the left figure , @xmath38 calculated in the model a",
    "the gmf is considered in the lower panel while not in the upper panel . for @xmath40 , there is zero or one source within 100 mpc .",
    "this extremely few number of sources leads to anisotropy much stronger than the observational result .",
    "thus , @xmath40 is too small to reproduce the observed arrival distribution . if , on the other hand , @xmath41 , which is comparable with the number of bright galaxies , high - precision isotropy of the arrival distribution is realized .",
    "this another extreme case can not also reproduce the observed anisotropy .",
    "thus , @xmath38 as a function of @xmath6 has the minimum at the intermediate number density",
    ". in the upper panel , @xmath38 is minimized at around @xmath7-@xmath10 , almost independent of the igmf strength in our igmf model . in our igmf model , since about 95% of volume within 100 mpc has no magnetic field , the highest energy protons are deflected only in the neighbourhood of their sources where the universe is magnetized . if the universe is strongly magnetized , for example , uniformly with @xmath42ng , the source number density is allowed to be smaller because strong deflections makes the arrival distribution to be isotropic even at the highest energies . in the lower panel , @xmath38 is minimized at the same number densities . the constrained number density is not dependent on the existence of the gmf since the clustering signal is almost not varied because of the coherence of the gmf .",
    "note that the gmf can changes the arrival directions of uhecrs efficiently and positional correlation with their sources as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we also estimate the source number density in the model b by similar discussion above . in the right figure , @xmath38 in the model b",
    "@xmath38 is minimized at around @xmath43-@xmath3 , which is about an order of magnitude more than in the model a. in the model b , luminous sources strongly contribute to the arriving cosmic rays and , on the other hand , weaker sources do not almost contribute the flux of cosmic rays though these are counted as sources .",
    "thus , the constrained number density is effectively larger .",
    "the number densities estimated from the anisotropy signal of the pao based on the two source models ( a & b ) are consistent with the results of our previous study using the agasa data @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty of about one order of magnitude will be reduced by 5 years observation by the pao , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the model a and b are two extreme cases . in the model",
    "a , all sources are identical .",
    "this model can be well applied to astrophysical objects which have hardly personality regarding emitted energy , or strongly active sources like fr ii galaxies and gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) ( though grbs are transient sources ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the model b is applied to objects common in the universe like bright galaxies .",
    "when the model b was constructed , the iras galaxies with luminosities of @xmath44-@xmath45 were adopted , where @xmath46 is the solar luminosity , @xmath47 w. the luminosities are over 5 orders of magnitude .",
    "the width of magnitude is realized by less active objects like bright galaxies and seyfert galaxies .",
    "in fact , uhecr sources have intermediate nature between the two models .",
    "assumed to be highly active objects , uhecr sources has the number density close to that in the model a. thus , the number density of uhecr sources can be estimated as @xmath1 .",
    "compared with the number densities of several candidates of uhecr sources , this estimated value can constrain the object - type of uhecr sources .",
    "table [ tab : candidates ] shows local number densities of several astrophysical objects .",
    "the objects which have smaller number density than the estimated one are not main contributors of the arrival highest energy cosmic rays .",
    "both fr ii galaxies and bl lac objects have been plausible uhecr sources theoretically @xcite , but they are not mainly contribute to the flux of uhecrs .",
    "note that this constraint does not reject them as uhecr sources .",
    "they are not main contributors .",
    "the number density of bright galaxies ( defined as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is absolute magnitude in b - band @xcite ) is much larger than our constraint .",
    "the generation of the highest energy cosmic rays is not common phenomena in the local universe .",
    "the number density of seyfert galaxies is an order of magnitude larger than the constrained value , and therefore it is allowed if @xmath50% of such seyfert galaxies has activity to accelerate uhecrs .",
    "however , seyfert galaxies are generally not expected to be uhecr sources . for example , the pao - correlated agns , most of all is seyfert or liner , do not show significant jet activity @xcite .",
    "therefore , there are no reasons for expecting them to accelerate cosmic rays up to the highest energies at all in the jet paradigm .",
    "the number density of fr i galaxies is @xmath1 @xcite , consistent with the constraint .",
    "fr i galaxy is one of plausible acceleration site up to the highest energies . centaurus a ( cen a ) , the nearest pao - correlated agns , is classified into fr i galaxy . at a hot spot in the jet in this galaxy ,",
    "an estimation of the maximum acceleration energy of protons is @xmath51 ev @xcite .",
    "if the other fr i galaxies have similar configurations , it is possible that fr i galaxies are main contributors of the highest energy cosmic rays .      at the previous section , we artificially neglect sources within 5 mpc from the galaxy .",
    "this is because very nearby sources inevitably produce anisotropy in arrival distribution of uhecrs at around @xmath0ev . since all observatories on uhecrs have reported isotropy in that energy range @xcite .",
    "it is inconsistent with the observational results .",
    "we discuss the isotropy in this subsection .",
    "[ fig : adn1672f50no1gmf0egmf4l0 ] shows the arrival distributions of protons above @xmath0 ev simulated from a source distribution in the model a with @xmath52 , which is about one order of magnitude larger than the number density constrained in the previous section . in the left figure ,",
    "the sources within 5 mpc are neglected .",
    "the number of events is set to 1672 , which corresponds to that detected by the pao @xcite .",
    "the igmf strength is @xmath53 g .    in the right figure ,",
    "strong anisotropies appear at the positions of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which are generated by protons injected from cen a and ngc 253 , a famous starburst galaxy , respectively .",
    "these distances are 4.6 mpc and 4.2 mpc in the iras pscz catalog , respectively @xcite .",
    "note that the distance of cen a is different among many catalogs .",
    "if these nearby objects are really uhecr sources , strong anisotropy is inevitably predicted .",
    "the pao reported that the arrival distribution of uhecrs above @xmath0 ev is consistent with isotropic distribution with 95% confidence level @xcite .",
    "thus , the anisotropy signals are inconsistent with the pao results .",
    "such anisotropy is predicted as long as there are uhecr sources in the nearby universe even if @xmath52 is adopted .",
    "on the other hand , the anisotropies disappears in the left figure .",
    "this fact is also true in the model b , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : adn1672f50no1gmf0egmf4l1 ] .",
    "thus , these nearby objects are not uhecr sources .",
    "in fact , the observed high - level isotropy can not be easily reproduced by neglecting sources within 5 mpc . in order to see this , we compare the auto - correlation function of simulated events above @xmath0 ev with that predicted from isotropic distribution .",
    "table [ tab : fraction ] shows the fraction of the number of source distributions which can reproduce the arrival distribution consistent with the isotropy within some errors written in the table .",
    "@xmath56 means the standard deviation of the auto - correlation function calculated from random distribution , which is due to the finite number of events .",
    "the normalization of the igmf strength considered is 0.1 and 0.4 @xmath39 g . in the model",
    "a , there are few source distributions with @xmath57 which can reproduce the isotropy within 2@xmath56 . even for @xmath52 , it is less than 10 though isotropy is found by eye in figs .",
    "[ fig : adn1672f50no1gmf0egmf4l0 ] and [ fig : adn1672f50no1gmf0egmf4l1 ] . if the number density is @xmath58 , the isotropy can be well reproduced .",
    "in addition to the structured igmf , we take account of a uniform turbulent magnetic field with the strength and coherent length of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "faraday rotation measurements of distant quasars shows @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "according to this constraint , we adopt @xmath62 ng and @xmath63 mpc .",
    "the results are also shown in table [ tab : fraction ] .",
    "we are able to find that the number of the source distributions which can reproduce the isotropy is increased , compared with that without the turbulent field . however , for the estimated number density , the number is still too small to naturally reproduce the isotropy . when the source number density an order of magnitude larger than the estimated one , the number is dramatically increased to 70 - 80% within 3@xmath56 in the model a. if the number density is @xmath58 , the isotropy can be well reproduced .",
    "it is much larger than the number density estimated based on the small - scale anisotropy at the highest energies .",
    "this fact indicates the existence of sources which contributes to lower energy cosmic rays , whose number density is @xmath2-@xmath3 . in other words",
    ", there are many sources with the maximum acceleration energy of @xmath4 ev .",
    "note that the uniform igmf does almost not affects the estimation of the number density at the highest energy .",
    "in this study , we estimated the number density of uhecr sources based on the statistical features of the arrival distribution of uhecrs observed by the pao .",
    "we simulated the arrival distributions of protons above @xmath0 ev , taking into consideration their propagation process in the galactic and intergalactic space .",
    "the igmf model adopted was associated with the observed large - scale structure . comparing the simulated arrival distributions with the data observed by the pao statistically , we estimated the number density which can best reproduce the observational result .",
    "the anisotropy signal above @xmath11 ev led to @xmath57 which is consistent with that of fr i galaxies , which are a candidate to accelerate protons up to @xmath5 ev .",
    "we also focused on isotropy in the arrival distribution at around @xmath0 ev , and then found @xmath64-@xmath3 , which is one or two order of magnitude larger than that estimated from the anisotropy .    in this calculation ,",
    "cosmological evolution of uhecr sources is not considered . since protons with @xmath4 ev",
    "can reach the earth from sources at the distance of 1gpc ( @xmath65 ) , which is comparable with the energy - loss length of such protons by bethe - heitler pair creation , it might be possible that the cosmological evolution could reproduce the isotropy even if the local number density of uhecr sources is comparable with @xmath1 .",
    "however , a typical evolution factor is @xmath66 , and therefore the number density at @xmath65 is only twice more than the local one .",
    "such a small factor could not change the estimated number density by two order of magnitude less .",
    "the difference between the two estimated number densities is significant .",
    "the difference can be interpreted as the evidence of the existence of uhecr sources which can accelerate protons up to @xmath4 ev assuming the persistent activity of uhecr sources .",
    "@xmath64-@xmath3 is comparable with the number densities of bright galaxies or seyfert galaxies .",
    "the proton acceleration up to @xmath0 ev might be common in the universe .",
    "we could also interpret this difference as transient activity to emit uhecrs .",
    "if bursting sources , like grbs , are assumed , apparent number density , which corresponds to @xmath6 estimated in this study , depends on the threshold of uhecr energies because the dispersion of the time - delay is larger at lower energies @xcite . however , quantitative discussion on this possibility exceeds the scope of this study .",
    "it is next study of ours .    in order to reproduce isotropy in the arrival distribution of uhecrs above @xmath0 ev",
    ", sources within 5 mpc were artificially neglected . in these sources ,",
    "cen a , the nearest radio - loud agn , is involved .",
    "the isotropy at around @xmath0 ev implies that it is not uhecr sources in our persistent source model .",
    "however , radio - loud agns have been plausible site for particle acceleration up to the highest energy @xcite , and the two of the highest energy events of the pao are correlated with the position of cen a within @xmath67 . whether cen a is really a uhecr source or not is a key to understand the mechanism to generate the highest energy cosmic rays .",
    "if cen a is not a uhecr source , we can interpret that the source of cosmic rays arriving in the direction of centaurus is behind cen a and more distant , so that the strong anisotropy is not generated .",
    "the 2 events towards cen a are also positionally correlated with ngc 5090 with @xmath67 , a radio galaxy with the distance of @xmath68 mpc .",
    "this might be a real source though the activity is weak like the other pao - correlated agns .",
    "these events are also towards centaurus cluster whose distance is about 40 mpc . an idea to generate uhe particles is cluster accretion shock @xcite . however",
    ", this scenario can accelerate protons up to @xmath4 ev .",
    "if cen a is a uhecr source , we propose several possibilities not to generate the anisotropy .",
    "one is uhecr composition . in the case of heavy dominated composition at energies above @xmath0 ev , the trajectories of uhecrs are deflected @xmath69 times more than those of protons , and the discussion on the isotropy in this paper is not applied .",
    "several composition measurements imply the existence of some fraction of heavy elements for all large uncertainty on hadronic interaction models in extensive air shower @xcite .",
    "the other is that the uhecr production is transient . for a bursting source ,",
    "the energy of cosmic rays observed at present is in narrow energy range since the time - delay of cosmic rays depends on their energies @xcite .",
    "in this brief picture , the 2 events are arrived from cen a , and the lower energies will come in the future .",
    "the detailed discussion on the two possibilities is our near future plan .",
    "the estimated number densities have some uncertainty because of the small number of detected events .",
    "the uncertainty to determine the number density at the highest energies can be reduced by increasing observed events @xcite and significant anisotropy would be observed in the arrival distribution at @xmath4 ev in the near future @xcite .",
