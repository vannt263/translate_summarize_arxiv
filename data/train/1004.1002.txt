    "globular clusters ( hereafter gcs ) are the oldest bound stellar systems in the milky way and other galaxies .",
    "they provide a fossil record of the earliest stages of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "located at a distance of @xmath15 kpc @xcite away , andromeda ( m31 ) is the nearest large spiral galaxy in our local group . according to the latest rbc v.4.0 @xcite , m31 contains more than one thousand gcs and candidates .",
    "therefore m31 gcs provide us an ideal laboratory for us to study the nature of extragalactic gcs and to better understand the formation and evolution of m31 .",
    "furthermore , since m31 is sb - type , which is similar to our galaxy , it may offer us the clues to formation and evolution history of our galaxy .",
    "the correlation of metallicity and colors of globular clusters has been previously studied by many authors : @xcite fitted the correlations of metallicities and ( @xmath16k ) , ( @xmath17k ) for galactic gcs and applied the calibrated relation to m31 gcs to derive the metallicities of m31 gcs .",
    "@xcite analyzed the correlations of ten intrinsic colors ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26k@xmath14 , @xmath27k@xmath14 ) and metallicity of 88 galactic gcs .",
    "they find that the correlation coefficients _ r _ for all these ten colors range from 0.91 to 0.77 , of which @xmath23 is the best metallicity indicator while @xmath24 is not so good .",
    "the authors also studied the @xmath26k@xmath14 and @xmath28k@xmath14 color - metallicity correlations for m31 and milky way globular clusters . in this work , we attempt to find the most metal - sensitive colors , which could be used for the derivation of the metallicities of gcs in the future work . it is well known that , spectroscopy is relatively expensive in terms of observational time and is rarely available for many extragalactic globular clusters .",
    "hence it is useful to determine metallicities from photometry .",
    "the studies on identification , classification and analysis of the m31 gcs have been started since the pioneering work of @xcite , ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these studies provided a large amount of photometric data in different photometric systems , i.e. ccd photometry , photoelectric photometry , and photographic plates , even visual photometry . in order to obtain homogeneous photometric catalogue of m31 gcs",
    ", @xcite took the photometry of @xcite as reference and transformed others to this reference and compiled the famous the revised bologna catalogue of m31 gcs and gc candidates ( the latest version is rbc v.4.0 ) , where 654 confirmed gcs and 619 gc candidates of m31 have been included , and 772 former gc candidates have been proved to be stars , asterism , galaxy , region hii or extended cluster .",
    "the catalogue also includes the newly discovered star clusters from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported the discovery of eight remote gcs in the outer halo of m31 by using the deep acs images ; @xcite found 1164 gcs and gc candidates in m31 with kpn 0.9 m telescope and the wiyn 3.5 m telescope , of which 559 are previously known gcs and 605 are newly found gc candidates ; later , @xcite detected 40 new gcs in the halo of m31 with isaac newton telescope and canada - france - hawaii telescope data .",
    "recently , @xcite presented a new catalogue of 670 likely star clusters , stars , possible stars and galaxies in the field of m31 , all with updated high - quality coordinates being accurate to @xmath29 based on the images from the local group survey @xcite or digitized sky survey ( dss ) .",
    "very recently , @xcite identified m31 gcs with images from wide field camera ( wfcam ) on the uk infrared telescope and sdss archives , and performed the photometry for them in sdss @xmath0 and infrared @xmath30 bands .",
    "furthermore , the authors combined all the identifications and photometry of m31 gcs from references and those of their new work and updated the m31 star cluster catalog , including 416 old confirmed clusters , 156 young clusters and 373 candidate clusters .",
    "our work is based on the 416 old confirmed m31 gcs , from which we will select our sample gcs .",
    "studies of m31 gcs based on batc observations are also numerous : @xcite presented the batc photometry of 172 gcs in the central @xmath31 deg@xmath32 region of m31 and estimated the ages for them with the simple stellar population ( ssp ) models .",
    "after that , @xcite added six more new batc observations fields surrounding the central region and performed the photometry for thirty gcs , which did not have the broadband photometry before . with the photometry ,",
    "the authors , for the first time , suggested the blue tilt of m31 gcs .",
    "@xcite fitted the ages of thirty - five gcs of the central m31 field which were not included in @xcite with batc , 2mass and galex data and the ssp models .",
    "later , @xcite performed the photometry for another 104 gcs of m31 and estimated the ages by fitting the seds with ssp models , revealing the existence of young , the intermediate - age and the old populations in m31 .    in this paper",
    ", first we used the batc data to analyze the correlations of spectroscopic metallicities and the colors of m31 gcs .",
    "moreover , we did the similar work with the @xmath0k band data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : sect .",
    "[ sect : data ] describes the data utilized in our work , including the spectroscopic metallicity from literature , batc archival images and the data reduction , the @xmath0k photometry from literature , along with the reddening of m31 gcs .",
    "[ sect : ana ] present the analysis and the results on the correlations of the metallicities and intrinsic colors for m31 gcs .",
    "the summary and remarkable conclusions of our work are in sect .",
    "[ sect : sum ] .",
    "the spectroscopic metallicities used in our analysis were from @xcite , who measured the metallicites for over 200 gcs in m31 with william herschel 4.2 m telescope in la palma , canary islands from nov .",
    "3 to 6 , 1996 .",
    "the wide field fibre optic spectrograph ( wyffos ) and two gratings ( the h2400b 2400 line grating and the r1200r 1200 line grating ) were applied for the observations .",
    "the dispersion of h2400b 2400 line grating is 0.8  pixel@xmath33 and spectral resolution is 2.5  over the range @xmath34  .",
    "the dispersion of the r1200r 1200 line grating observations is 1.5  pixel@xmath33 and the resolution is 5.1  over the spectral range @xmath35  .",
    "the total wavelength coverage of the spectra is @xmath36  , and it can coverage the spectral features such as cn , h@xmath37 , the mg @xmath38 triplet , iron lines .",
    "for homogenous reason , we only adopted the spectroscopic metallicities from @xcite in our work .",
    "the 15-band archival images of m31 field were obtained by batc 60/90 cm f/3 schmidt telescope at xinglong site of hebei provence , china , during 1995 february @xmath39 2008 march .",
    "the total exposure time of archival m31 batc images is 143.9 hours with 447 frames and covering @xmath40 sky field .",
    "the observations and dataset are described in detail by @xcite .",
    "the fifteen intermediate - band filters of batc system are specifically designed to avoid most bright night - sky emissions , covering the wavelength range of @xmath413,000 to @xmath4110,000  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "before this work , @xcite have performed usual data reduction for these images , including bias subtraction and flat fielding of the ccd images , with an automatic data - reduction routine pipeline  i , developed for the batc sky survey based on iraf .",
    "the batc magnitudes are well defined and obtained in a similar way as for the spectrophotometric ab magnitude system ( for details see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for batc fifteen intermediate - band filters @xmath42 of the central field of m31 ( m31 - 1 field )",
    ", @xcite calibrated the combined images with @xcite standard stars ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while for the m31 - 2 to m31 - 7 fields , the secondary standard stars of the overlapping field were used for the flux calibration ( for details see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this work",
    ", we performed the aperture photometry for m31 gcs with the batc photometric routine pipeline  ii , which is the revised version of iraf _ daofind _ and _ daophot _ for batc system data reduction . for aperture photometry parameters",
    ", we adopted the aperture radius @xmath43 and the inner sky radius and outer sky radius are @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , which are the same parameters as those used in @xcite for consistency .",
    "after careful checking all the images , we found the signal - to - noise ratios ( snr ) of batc @xmath46-band and @xmath38-band images are not high enough for our study , thus we do not included these images in the following work .",
    "then , we obtained the batc magnitudes of our sample gcs in the thirteen bands ( from @xmath1 to @xmath2 ) , covering the wavelength from @xmath47 to @xmath48  .    because the spectroscopic metallicities of @xcite were based on the [ fe / h ] calibration of @xcite , who only included old gcs in their calibration sample , only the metallicities of the old gcs in @xcite are reliable .",
    "further , it has long been known that the degeneracy of age and metallicity for seds and color fitting of the star clusters ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , fortunately , the sed / colors are only weakly correlated with age , if the gcs are old enough . thus ,",
    "if we only study the old gcs , the sed / colors are only a function of metallicity , which could eliminate effects of the other factors . for these reasons",
    ", we just used the old confirmed gcs with observed metallcities to avoid these problems and ensure our results reliable .",
    "this resulted in 144 matches between the the sample of 416 old confirmed clusters from @xcite and the spectroscopic metallicity sample of @xcite .",
    "all the matched m31 gcs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] with batc observational field overlaid .",
    "the matched gcs are marked with small circles , of which four are out of batc field of view .",
    "for the comparisons with the previous photometry of these m31 gcs , we transformed the batc intermediate - band system to the @xmath49 broad - band system using the transformation formulas between these two systems from @xcite .",
    "the formulas were derived based on the batc observations of the landolt standard stars from the catalogs of @xcite and @xcite in fifteen colors . since the photometry in the batc @xmath46 and",
    "@xmath38 filters are not used in our work , we can not obtain the @xmath50 magnitudes from batc photometry .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the comparisons of the @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 photometry in our work with previous measurements from rbc v.4.0 .",
    "the mean magnitude offsets are @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 . from this figure",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath54 derived from batc photometry are consistent with that from rbc v.4.0 , although there are some scatter points .",
    "it also might be noticed that the offset of the @xmath53-band photometry is slightly larger than that for the other band .",
    "this may be due to the errors in the transformation formula by using the batc photometry of the landolt standard stars , since the spectrum of a globular cluster and a star is different .",
    "further , we should be aware of heterogeneous photometry summarized in rbc v.4.0 although the authors made great effort to make it uniform , which might still introduce the offset in the comparisons .",
    "in general , we believe that our photometry is consistent with the previous studies and it will not produce bias or affect our results in our work .      as we described in sect . [",
    "sect : intr ] , @xcite identified m31 gcs with the sdss archive and images taken from wide field camera ( wfcam ) on the uk infrared telescope .",
    "the authors used the sextractor @xcite for the identifications and photometry of sources in sdss images and they found good consistency with the previous photometry .",
    "the k - band images were reduced with the wfcam pipeline and the magnitudes were calibrated with the 2mass point source catalogue .",
    "thus , we draw the attention of readers that the @xmath0 photometry of @xcite is in ab - based photometric system while for the k photometry is in vega - based photometric system . in our work , we did not transform all the magnitudes into the same ( ab - based or vega - based ) photometric system because such color shift will not affect the correlations coefficients in our analysis .",
    "further this way could keep consistency and avoid confusion .",
    "finally the authors listed the photometry for 416 old confirmed m31 gcs in the sdss @xmath0 bands and 2mass k band , which may be the latest work for study of m31 gcs .",
    "this photometry catalogue will be utilized for our following analysis .      in order to obtain the intrinsic colors for the sample gcs ,",
    "all the colors derived in our work should be corrected by reddening .",
    "here we adopted the reddening from @xcite and @xcite , which are the two most comprehensive reddening catalogue for m31 gcs so far .",
    "@xcite calibrated the relations of the intrinsic color and metallicity and the @xmath59parameters for the galactic gcs and then applied the relations to m31 .",
    "the authors assumed that the extinction laws of m31 and milky way are the same , and they proved that the assumption is reasonable , which indicates their results are reliable .",
    "finally , @xcite determined the reddenings for 314 of m31 gcs and gc candidates , of which 221 are reliable ( from the private communication ) .",
    "later , @xcite used the similar method with the photometry of rbc v.3.5 @xcite and enlarged the reddening sample of m31 gcs to 443 ones , half of which have @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , @xcite find good agreement between their reddening with the previously determined reddening of @xcite .",
    "these two reddening catalogues of m31 gcs will be applied for our following study .",
    "in this section , we investigate the correlations between spectroscopic metallicities and the batc colors ; further we analyzed the similar correlations for @xmath0k colors in @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to find the most metal - sensitive and most metal - nonsensitive colors , which might provide a method for roughly estimating the metallicities just by colors .      from the 140 gcs in the batc field of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , there are still nine clusters which we can not obtain accurate photometric measurements due to nearby bright objects ( b065-g126 , b091d - d058 , b160-g214 and b072 ) , very low signal - to - noise ( b305-d024 ) , or steep gradients in the galaxy light near the nucleus ( b129 ) . moreover , there are some problems with the photometry of three gcs : b127-g185 , b225-g280 and b306-g029 .",
    "we found `` emission lines '' in their seds , however , after careful checking of images , it turns out to be not real .",
    "for these reasons , we exclude these nine clusters from our sample and reduce the number of sample gcs to 131 , which have the reliable batc photometry .    because we only concern the intrinsic colors , all the observed colors obtained in our work are required to be corrected by reddening . as recalled in sect .",
    "[ sect : red ] , the reddening of m31 gcs from @xcite and @xcite will be applied for the estimation of intrinsic colors . for each object , we searched and adopted the reddening from @xcite as priority , since it is homogeneous and the number of gcs included is greater than that of @xcite . if a gc does not have the reddening in @xcite , we used the reddening of @xcite instead . considering",
    "the reddening can affect the color ( hence the correlations ) significantly , the gcs which do not have reddenings from either @xcite or @xcite are excluded from our analysis .",
    "after the elimination , we obtain 123 old confirmed gcs with known reddening , which will be used as our final sample for the analysis of correlations between the metallicity and batc colors .    as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect : batc ] , the images in the thirteen batc bands ( from @xmath1 to @xmath2 band ) were used in our work , thus seventy - eight different colors could be derived and used in the correlations analysis .",
    "we plotted the correlations between all the batc intrinsic color and the metallicities from @xcite in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "we performed the linear regressions of the intrinsic colors against metallicity correlations for the 123 gcs of m31 with an equation below , @xmath61}\\ ] ] here we use @xmath62 as general notation to represent any intrinsic batc color .",
    "it is worth noting that there are several outliers in fig.[fig3 ] , which seems not to follow the general trend very well .",
    "this may be due to the errors on the metallicity , inaccurate reddening estimates , or the errors on the photometry .",
    "further , although the gcs in our sample are old and the seds almost the same , the slight difference of ages also might cause such scatter .",
    "table [ t1.tab ] lists the batc intrinsic colors , intercede @xmath46 and slope @xmath38 , the correlation coefficients @xmath8 , fitting point numbers of our sample of m31 gcs .",
