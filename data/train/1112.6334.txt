    "the most salient electronic properties of graphene and its nanostructures are linked to the bipartite nature of the honeycomb lattice which is formed by two interpenetrating identical triangular sublattices@xcite .",
    "it is customary to refer to the sublattice as a pseudospin degree of freedom . in this language ,",
    "the first neighbor hopping is described in terms of a pseudo - spin flip operator , which results in the well studied electron - hole symmetric bands in graphene , whose wave - functions are sublattice unpolarized .",
    "the pseudospin symmetry becomes a chiral symmetry in the continuum limit in which electrons in graphene are described with a dirac hamiltonian@xcite and accounts for the lack of backscattering@xcite , the so called chiral tunneling@xcite and the absence of an energy gap in two dimensional graphene .",
    "sublattice symmetry breaking in graphene could arise spontaneously , due to some electronic phase transition@xcite , or due to the coupling of graphene to some substrate , like silicon carbide@xcite and boron nitride@xcite .",
    "sublattice symmetry breaking would make it energetically favorable for the electrons to stay in one of the sublattices , resulting in pseudo - spin order ( either spontaneous , or induced ) .",
    "the purpose of this work is to understand the interplay between induced pseudo - spin order and real spin order in graphene .",
    "magnetic order is expected to take place in monohidrogenated graphene zigzag edges . within the standard one - orbital tight - binding model of graphene ,",
    "these edges give rise to a large density of states at the fermi energy@xcite which is prone to a ferromagnetic inestability when coulomb repulsion is considered within the mean field hubbard model @xcite .",
    "density functional calculations confirmed the scenario@xcite , showing that the long - range coulomb interactions and the other atomic orbitals , absent in the hubbard model , do not play a major role in this system .",
    "both the mean field hubbard model@xcite and dft calculations show that the magnetic phase with zero total spin has a gap , which opens due to inter - edge correlations@xcite .",
    "the fabrication of graphene ribbons with ultrasmooth edges is now possible by unzipping carbon nanotubes@xcite .",
    "indirect evidence of magnetic order in the edges of zigzag ribbons is provided by scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) that can be accounted for within the mean field hubbard model @xcite .    the sublattice degree of freedom plays a central role in the magnetic properties of bipartite lattices@xcite .",
    "very much like an external magnetic field favors one spin orientation and splits the spin states , an external perturbation favors one sublattice with respect to the other and opens a gap in the band structure of graphene@xcite . when this happens , it is not obvious a priori what happens to the edge states , even at the single particle level , and the associated magnetism .",
    "dft calculations indicate that boron nitride zigzag ribbons with the edge atoms passivated with hydrogen are non - magnetic@xcite whereas graphene ribbons , deposited on boron nitride ( @xmath7 ) whose lattice parameter is shifted to match graphene , indicate that edge magnetism survives @xcite .",
    "these dft calculations suggest that as the sublattice symmetry breaking potential @xmath6 increases , a phase transition must occur from magnetic to non - magnetic edges . here",
    "we address this problem using a much simpler description of the electron - electron interactions , namely , the mean field approximation for the hubbard model , in the spirit of earlier work for graphene with the full sublattice symmetry and on recent work for graphene zigzag ribbons without inversion symmetry@xcite .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present some general theorems regarding the properties of the single particle states of the tight - binding model for graphene with a staggered potential . in section",
    "iii we study the interacting model for the case of two dimensional graphene and study how the staggered potential affects the non - magnetic to antiferromagnetic transition . in section",
    "iv we study the interplay of magnetic and pseudo - spin order in the case of zigzag ribbons .",
    "we find that magnetic order and sub lattice symmetry breaking give rise to spin polarization of the bands , and in some instances we find half - metallic antiferromagnetic order .",
    "the spin filter properties of this case are studied in section v , where we consider quantum transport between two half - metallic zigzag ribbons separated by a non - magnetic armchair central region . in section vi",
    "we summarize our main findings .",
    "in this section we consider some quite general properties of the single particle states of the hamiltonian of a bipartite sub - lattice with a constant sublattice symmetry breaking term : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are matrices with dimension given by the number of atoms in sublattice @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we consider first the case of a bipartite lattice _ without sublattice imbalance _ , so that the number of atoms in sublattice @xmath11 equals those in lattice @xmath12 : @xmath13 . in that case ,",
    "@xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath10 are all matrices of range @xmath13 .",

    "if @xmath20 is an eigenstate of @xmath16 with energy @xmath21 , we automatically have that @xmath22 is also eigenstate with energy @xmath23 @xmath24 thus , the chiral symmetry ensures that the spectrum of @xmath16 has electron hole symmetry .",
    "in addition , since @xmath25 and @xmath26 are eigenvectors of the same hamiltonian with different eigenvalues they must be orthogonal .",
    "this leads to : @xmath27 or more explicitly @xmath28 thus , this lead us directly that eigenstates of @xmath16 have equal total weight on the two sublattices . in a pseudospin language",
    ", they have a zero expectation value of the @xmath17 pseudospin operator , since the hamiltonian has the pseudomagnetic field ( the hopping ) in the @xmath29 plane .",
    "we now turn our attention to the eigenstates of a tight - binding hamiltonian with first neighbour hoppings defined in a bipartite lattice with a sublattice - dependent potential which is both homogeneous and traceless , as defined by equation ( [ h0 ] ) .",
    "we are going to show that they also have electron - hole symmetry .",
    "for that matter , we represent @xmath30 in the the subspace defined for a pair of eigenstates of @xmath16 , @xmath25 and @xmath31 , with energies @xmath21 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "we readily obtain @xmath32 whose eigenvalues are @xmath33 with corresponding eigenvectors @xmath34 given by :    @xmath35    and @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "thus , if we know ( half of ) the spectrum and the eigenstate of the sublattice symmetric problem @xmath16 , we can easily build the spectrum and the eigenfunctions for the same lattice when a homogeneous traceless sublattice zeeman term is added to the hamiltonian .",

    "this are the so called midgap states and play a crucial role in the emergence of magnetism in graphene zigzag edges@xcite and graphene with chemisorbed hydrogen@xcite .    it can be inmediately seen that if @xmath43 is a zero energy eigenstate of @xmath45 it is also an eigenstate of @xmath46 with eigenvalue @xmath47 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath16 presents a zero energy state sublattice polarized in @xmath12 , then that state is also eigenvector of @xmath30 with energy @xmath48 .",

    "our main findings can be summarized as follows :    1 .   we have shown that for a bipartite lattice with a site - independent pseudo - spin zeeman term the resulting spectrum has electron hole symmetry , except for mid - gap states that arise in lattices with a different number of sites in the two sublattices .",
    "we have shown that , if the @xmath49 hamiltonian has an eigenstate @xmath125 with energy @xmath21 , it has also an eigenstate @xmath25 with energy @xmath23 and the hamiltonian with finite @xmath6 has two eigenstates , linear combination of @xmath26 and @xmath25 with energies @xmath126 2 .   if @xmath26 localized in the @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) sublattice is an eigenstate with energy @xmath39 of the @xmath49 hamiltonian , then it is also an eigenstate of the hamiltonian with finite @xmath6 and energy @xmath6 ( @xmath127 ) 3 .   two dimensional graphene with finite @xmath6 undergoes a transition to an antiferromagnetic state with spin - split bands , for @xmath81 .",
