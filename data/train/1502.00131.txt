    "the interaction of horizontal shear flows and magnetic fields in stably stratified layers is central to many problems in astrophysical fluid dynamics  involving , for example , planetary interiors , stellar radiative zones and accretion discs .",
    "an important example of such a flow , which has received considerable attention recently , is that of the solar tachocline ( see hughes , rosner & weiss @xcite ) .",
    "the tachocline , discovered via helioseismic observations , is a thin layer in the sun , extending downwards from the ( neutrally stable ) base of the convective zone to the ( stably stratified ) top of the radiative interior , characterised by radial velocity shear and also planetary scale horizontal shears , associated with the equator to pole differential rotation of the sun .",
    "most models of the solar dynamo invoke the tachocline as the site for the storage and generation of the sun s strong , predominantly toroidal magnetic field .",
    "here we are interested in the stability of such shear flows , and how this depends upon the velocity profile , magnetic field strength , and stratification .",
    "specifically , we consider the linear stability of a steady parallel flow and aligned magnetic field , both sheared in the horizontal cross - stream direction , in the inviscid and perfectly conducting limit . in this first study , we consider the case where there is no background rotation .",
    "the nonlinear regime of such instabilities typically leads to turbulent flows ; these may be important for dynamo action , through some mean - field @xmath0-effect , and also for the transport of mass and momentum , which can feed back on the large - scale flow .",
    "it is possible to examine the stability of such flows in a continuously stratified three - dimensional setting ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , here we adopt the alternative approach of considering the dynamics of a thin fluid layer under the shallow - water approximation , which is valid when the horizontal length scale of the motion is long compared with the depth of the fluid layer , as is typically the case in large - scale astrophysical flows .",
    "this leads to a set of two - dimensional partial differential equations , with no explicit dependence on the vertical co - ordinate , which offers a considerable mathematical simplification .",
    "such shallow - water equations capture the fundamental dynamics of density stratification , including gravity waves , and allow the interaction of stratification with horizontal shear flows and magnetic fields to be analysed in the simplest possible setting .",
    "it should be noted that hydrodynamic shallow - water models , which date back to laplace , are derived by considering a thin fluid layer of constant density bounded below by a rigid medium and above by a fluid of negligible inertia ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the corresponding reduction for electrically conducting fluids  the shallow - water magnetohydrodynamic ( swmhd ) equations of @xcite  additionally requires the fluid layer to be a perfect conductor , and to be bounded above and below by perfect conductors .",
    "there are few direct astrophysical analogues for such a configuration .",
    "however , we can borrow an important idea from planetary atmospheric dynamics , where the hydrodynamic shallow - water equations are widely used to understand waves and instabilities in a continuously stratified atmospheric layer .",
    "this is justified because there is a formal mathematical analogy between the linearised equations in the two systems , provided the layer depth in the shallow - water model is taken to be a so - called equivalent depth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that the shallow - water gravity wave speed ( in the horizontal ) matches that of ( the fastest ) gravity waves in a continuously stratified layer .",
    "we have this analogy in mind throughout this study .",
    "the swmhd equations have been studied widely in recent years .",
    "they have been shown to possess a hyperbolic as well as a hamiltonian structure @xcite , and to support wave motions such as inertia - gravity waves and alfvn waves @xcite .",
    "as reviewed by @xcite , they have also been used to study the linear instability of shear flows in spherical geometry , often with modelling tachocline instabilities in mind .",
    "these previous studies considered basic states that were functions only of latitude , investigating the dependence of the instabilities on the strength and spatial structure of the magnetic field and on a ( reduced ) gravity parameter @xcite .",
    "in contrast to previous investigations of the instabilities of shear flows in swmhd , which focused on global instabilities in spherical geometry , here we concentrate on local instabilities , with the aim of examining the linear instability problem in a wider context ; for this , we consider the problem in planar geometry .",
    "we first derive some growth rate bounds and stability criteria , valid for general basic states .",
    "we then study how the instability characteristics of prototypical flows are modified by the combined action of magnetic fields and stratification , which , in isolation , are generally thought to be stabilising .",
    "the corresponding hydrodynamic problem has a long history , dating back to rayleigh , and we are able to draw upon ideas and methods from a substantial literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we start , in  2 , by formulating the linear instability problem for plane - parallel basic states with the flow and field dependent on the cross - stream direction . in  3 , we derive extensions of classical growth rate bounds , semi - circle theorems , stability criteria , and parity results for modal solutions . in  4 ,",
    "instabilities of piecewise - constant velocity profiles ( the vortex sheet and the rectangular jet ) with a uniform magnetic field are examined analytically .",
    "analogous smooth profiles ( the hyperbolic - tangent shear layer and the bickley jet ) are studied in  5 , both numerically and asymptotically , via a generalisation of the long - wave analysis of @xcite . the primary instability mechanism for shear layers",
    "is interpreted in terms of counter - propagating rossby waves .",
    "the results are discussed in  6 .",
    "we consider a thin layer of perfectly electrically conducting fluid moving under the influence of gravity .",
    "we use a cartesian geometry , with horizontal coordinates @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and an upwards pointing coordinate @xmath3 . at time @xmath4",
    ", the fluid , which is taken to be inviscid and of constant density @xmath5 , has a free surface at @xmath6 and is bounded below by a rigid impermeable boundary at @xmath7 .",
    "we consider motions with a characteristic horizontal length scale @xmath8 that is long compared with a characteristic layer depth @xmath9 .",
    "one can then make a shallow - water reduction in which the vertical momentum balance is taken to be magneto - hydrostatic , and for which the horizontal velocity @xmath10 and horizontal magnetic field @xmath11 are independent of @xmath3 .",
    "when the bottom boundary is perfectly electrically conducting ( and is thus a magnetic field line ) and the free surface remains a field line , the magnetic shallow - water equations of @xcite are obtained .",
    "these are an extension of the classical shallow - water equations of geophysical fluid dynamics .",
    "we use these equations in non - dimensional form .",
    "we denote the characteristic horizontal velocity of the basic state by @xmath12 , and the characteristic magnetic field strength by @xmath13 .",
    "non - dimensionalising @xmath1 and @xmath2 by @xmath8 , @xmath4 by the advective time - scale @xmath14 , @xmath15 by @xmath9 , @xmath16 by @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is the acceleration due to gravity ) , velocity by @xmath12 , and magnetic field by @xmath13 , the swmhd equations are    [ ch3:basic - equation ] @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with @xmath22 being the permeability of the fluid .",
    "in addition to ( [ ch3:basic - equation]@xmath23@xmath24 ) , the shallow - water reduction implies @xmath25 however , need not be considered explicitly ; if it is satisfied at some initial time , then ( [ ch3:basic - equation]@xmath23@xmath24 ) guarantee that it remains satisfied for all time .",
    "the system has two non - dimensional parameters .",
    "the froude number @xmath26 is the ratio of the characteristic horizontal velocity of the basic state to the gravity wave speed @xmath27 ( and is related to the reduced gravity parameter @xmath28 of @xcite via @xmath29 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 is the ratio of the alfvn wave speed @xmath31 to the characteristic horizontal velocity of the basic state .",
    "when @xmath15 is constant and @xmath32 , ( [ ch3:basic - equation3 ] ) and ( [ ch3:basic - equation4 ] ) become @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively , and we recover the equations for two - dimensional incompressible magnetohydrodynamics , with @xmath16 playing the role of pressure .",
    "when @xmath35 , decouples from ( [ ch3:basic - equation]@xmath23@xmath24 ) , and we recover the hydrodynamic shallow - water equations ; these have a well - known correspondence with two - dimensional compressible hydrodynamics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which we exploit from time to time .    as an example of astrophysical parameter values , we estimate @xmath26 and @xmath30 in the solar tachocline , using data from @xcite .",
    "we set @xmath12 to be the equator to pole difference in the zonal velocity , implying @xmath36 .",
    "there is considerable uncertainty in the strength of the magnetic field in the tachocline @xcite , although a likely range is @xmath37 .",
    "then , taking @xmath38 , we find @xmath39 . to estimate @xmath26 , we must choose a gravity wave speed @xmath27 for the layer .",
    "one means of doing this is to take @xmath9 to be the depth of the tachocline and to interpret @xmath18 as a reduced gravity , accounting for the fractional density difference of the overlying fluid , as in @xcite .",
    "however , here we pursue the analogy between shallow - water flows and those of a continuously stratified layer with buoyancy frequency @xmath40 and depth @xmath41 , and choose @xmath27 to be the speed of the fastest gravity wave in such a layer , which is @xmath42 @xcite . taking @xmath43 m ( i.e.  @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the solar radius ) and @xmath46 , which are bulk values that might describe a mode spanning the entire tachocline , gives a gravity wave speed @xmath47 , corresponding to an equivalent depth @xmath48 km ( taking @xmath49 ) . again taking @xmath50",
    ", we thus estimate @xmath51 , although it is clear that @xmath26 would be somewhat smaller or larger if one considered motions towards the top of the radiative zone ( with stronger stratification ) or towards the base of the convection zone ( with weaker stratification ) .      above a topography of the form @xmath52",
    ", we consider a basic state @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , so that the magnetic field is initially aligned with the flow .",

    "the linear evolution is described by    [ ch3:linear - equ1 ] @xmath59    where a prime denotes differentiation .",

    "in the non - magnetic shallow - water limit ( @xmath66 ) , reduces to equation  ( 3.4 ) of @xcite . in the two - dimensional incompressible magnetohydrodynamic limit ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) , reduces to equation  ( 3.5 ) of @xcite",

    "instability then occurs if @xmath77 , with growth rate @xmath78 .",
    "in this section we derive three results that hold for general shear flows @xmath79 : two provide bounds on the growth rate of any instability , whereas the third concerns implications of the parity of the basic state flow .      a bound on the instability growth rate may be obtained by calculating the rate of change of the total disturbance energy using the combination @xmath80 where @xmath81 denotes complex conjugate . on adopting the form for the perturbations , the real part of this expression gives ( on dropping hats ) @xmath82 on integrating over the @xmath2 domain , employing the boundary condition on @xmath60 , and manipulating the remaining terms on the right hand side using @xmath83 , we obtain the following bound on the growth rate : @xmath84 in the absence of magnetic field , this reduces to the well - known bound in hydrodynamics @xcite .      in a classic paper",
    ", @xcite proved that for incompressible hydrodynamic parallel shear flows , the wave speed @xmath24 of any unstable mode must lie within a semi - circle in the complex plane determined by properties of the basic state flow . subsequently , semi - circle theorems have been derived for several other hydrodynamical and hydromagnetic systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in a similar manner , a semi - circle theorem may be derived for the swmhd system .",

    "semi - circle   lies wholly within semi - circle , and we recover the well - known result of @xcite .",
    "however , as observed by @xcite , who considered the stability of aligned fields and flows in incompressible mhd , for non - zero magnetic field there is the possibility of the two semi - circles overlapping , being disjoint , or indeed ceasing to exist ; thus , in addition to giving eigenvalue bounds for unstable modes , these results also provide sufficient conditions for stability . from and it therefore follows that the basic state is linearly stable if any one of the following three conditions is satisfied : @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 these results are equivalent to those given by @xcite for incompressible mhd .",
    "a drawback of the above approach is that the bounds do not contain the froude number @xmath26 .",
    "although it is possible to introduce @xmath26 into the semi - circle bounds using similar manipulations to that employed by @xcite , as shown by @xcite this does not sharpen the bound and we thus omit it .      for the hydrodynamic case",
    ", it can be shown that symmetries of the basic state lead to symmetries in the stability problem @xcite .",
    "these results may be generalised to swmhd if we make the further assumptions that @xmath101 and @xmath102 are even functions about @xmath103 .",
    "we first consider the case when @xmath79 is odd about @xmath103 .",
    "equation   is unchanged under @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "since the equation is also unchanged under @xmath106 and @xmath107 , it follows that an eigenfunction with eigenvalue @xmath108 must be accompanied by eigenfunctions with @xmath109 .",
    "thus unstable solutions either have @xmath110 or are a pair of counter - propagating waves with the same phase speed . as argued by @xcite , the symmetry in the basic state implies that there is no preferred direction for wave propagation , consistent with the form of the eigenvalues .    now consider the case when @xmath79 is even about @xmath103 . then @xmath111 are also eigenfunctions of .",
    "following @xcite , if we now take @xmath112 multiplied by with @xmath113 and subtract this from @xmath114 multiplied by with @xmath115 , integrating over @xmath116 gives @xmath117^{+l_{y}}_{-l_{y } } = \\textrm{constant } = 0,\\ ] ] owing to the imposed boundary conditions on the eigenfunction .",
    "the vanishing of the wronskian @xmath118 implies that the functions @xmath119 and @xmath120 are linearly dependent throughout the domain , which is possible only if one of them is identically zero .",
    "thus an unstable eigenfunction corresponding to a particular eigenvalue is either an even or odd function about @xmath103 .",

    "motivated by geophysical and astrophysical considerations , previous authors have extended separately the analysis to include the influence of shallow - water dynamics and a magnetic field . here , for the first time",
    ", we have applied this classical approach to the swmhd system , complementing previous work on the instability of specific flow configurations in spherical geometry @xcite .",
    "we first considered the stability of arbitrary flow and field profiles , leading to the growth rate bound   and the semi - circle theorems   and , which , in turn , imply the stability criteria    .",
    "more detailed investigations focused on shear layers and jets , which are known from hydrodynamical problems to be canonical flows @xcite .",
    "for each of these we considered both discontinuous profiles , for which dispersion relations can be obtained analytically , and analogous smooth profiles , for which numerical solutions were obtained .",
    "we also took the background magnetic field to be uniform ; this simple choice already leads to interesting stability characteristics .",
    "the imposed field strength is measured by a parameter @xmath30 , whilst the stratification is measured by the froude number @xmath26 .    for the shear layer we considered the vortex sheet and the hyperbolic tangent velocity profile . for both profiles , a key finding is that , although increasing @xmath30 or @xmath26 in the absence of the other is seen to be stabilising , their combined effects can offset each other , resulting in a tongue of instability for arbitrarily large @xmath26 and @xmath30 approaching unity .",
    "however , the strongest instabilities are found at smaller @xmath26 and @xmath30 .",
    "for the smooth shear layer , these were interpreted through the counter - propagating rossby waves ( crws ) mechanism , which has been used to understand hydrodynamic shear instabilities ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . here",
    "we show that the vorticity anomalies associated with shallow - water effects and magnetic tension oppose those for the underlying crw mechanism . as far as we can tell , this is the first time such a dynamic argument has been invoked to explain the stabilisation of shear flow instabilities by a magnetic field . for the smooth shear layer alone , there is a weak secondary instability when @xmath239 , analogous to those found in other hydrodynamic systems @xcite .",
    "further insight was obtained by performing a long wave asymptotic analysis for an arbitrary shear profile , extending the hydrodynamic treatment of @xcite to swmhd .",
    "there is a primary mode of instability , yielding a dispersion relation identical to that of the vortex sheet , thus showing the widespread applicability of the vortex sheet model . for sufficiently large @xmath26",
    ", the long wave analysis recovers the weaker secondary mode .    for jets , we considered the top - hat velocity profile and , as its smooth counterpart , the bickley jet .",
    "for both profiles , the modes of instability are either even or odd about the jet axis . at large @xmath0 ,",
    "dynamics on the flanks of the top - hat become uncoupled , and hence the instabilities become those of the vortex sheets on the flanks",
    ". however , this behaviour does not carry over to the bickley jet , since the even and odd modes are stabilised when @xmath427 and @xmath428 , respectively . for small @xmath0 ,",
    "the even mode is only unstable when @xmath429 .",
    "this result applies for both the top - hat profile and arbitrary smooth jets , showing the widespread applicability of the top - hat model for the even mode at small @xmath0 . for small @xmath0 ,",

    "although we can be precise about the behaviour at large and small @xmath0 , in general either the even or odd mode may be more unstable .",
    "finally , in addition to these two primary modes of instability , there exist multiple secondary modes of instability at large @xmath26 , with relatively small growth rates .    given the motivation for this study , it is important to consider the implications of our results for the solar tachocline . adopting the tachocline radius ( @xmath432 ) as a characteristic length scale @xmath8 and taking @xmath433 as a characteristic velocity ,",
    "as discussed in  2 , the @xmath333-folding time for an instability is given by @xmath434 . with @xmath51 , @xmath435 over the range of @xmath30 anticipated for the tachocline , for both shear layers and jets ( see figures  [ fig : tanh_growth ] and [ fig : bickley_growth_even_odd ] ) , leading to large - scale instabilities with @xmath436 , a relevant timescale for solar dynamics .",
    "it is hard to draw direct comparisons with previous results on swmhd instabilities @xcite .",
    "these studies , which were focused on the tachocline , were in spherical geometry with background rotation .",
    "furthermore , the main emphasis of the work was on the destabilisation of hydrodynamically stable velocity profiles by non - uniform toroidal fields .",
    "having investigated the quite complicated behaviour that results from our idealised model , there are , within the present geometry , several natural extensions of our study .",
    "the inclusion of rotation could be considered ; even in the hydrodynamic case this modifies the nature of the instabilities .",
    "non - uniform magnetic fields open up the possibility of destabilising hydrodynamically stable velocity profiles , as in @xcite and @xcite .",
