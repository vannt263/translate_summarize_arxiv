    "the transport of electrons through ballistic mesoscopic cavities has emerged as a subject of intensive research in recent years @xcite .",
    "the technological advancement has made it possible to fabricate mesoscopic cavities of arbitrary geometries and degree of disorder @xcite .",
    "the main theoretical tools used to study the quantum conductance phenomenon in these systems include random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite , diagrammatic methods @xcite , semiclassical methods @xcite and supersymmetry techniques @xcite .",
    "rmt provides a convenient way to study the transport properties when the underlying classical dynamics of these cavities is chaotic @xcite , and it has been quite successful .",
    "the scattering matrix @xmath3 , which relates the electron fluxes in the two leads connected to the mesoscopic cavity , is central to the problem of quantum transport . under rmt",
    "the scattering matrix is assumed to belong to one of dyson s standard circular ensembles .",
    "a microscopic justification for using circular ensembles as models for scattering matrices has been provided by calculations involving the gaussian ensembles @xcite .",
    "the appropriate circular random matrix ensemble for the problem is decided by the time - reversal and rotational symmetries of the system and is determined by its invariance under orthogonal , symplectic or unitary transformations @xcite .",
    "the invariant ensembles are abbreviated as oe , se and ue respectively and characterize the three classes of chaotic cavities .",
    "various physical quantities of interest such as average conductance , average shot - noise power and variance of conductance derive from the statistics of transmission eigenvalues , which are obtained by considering the polar decomposition of the scattering matrix .",
    "it turns out that the statistics of transmission eigenvalues @xmath4 for the invariant cases is related to the statistics of eigenvalues of a special case of jacobi ensembles under a simple linear transformation of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the relation between transmission eigenvalues obtained from the scattering matrix and the eigenvalues of jacobi ensembles of random matrices has been explicitly shown in @xcite for the invariant cases .",
    "the problem of statistics intermediate between above invariant classes is also important .",
    "for instance , application of a weak magnetic field to the system breaks the time - reversal symmetry partially . in this case , depending on the presence or absence of spin - rotation symmetry of the electron , statistics intermediate between oe and ue or se and ue is observed .",
    "the problem of intermediate statistics in oe - ue and se - ue transitions has been solved exactly for the energy level correlations as modeled by the gaussian @xcite and circular @xcite ensembles and recently for the entire jacobi family of random matrix ensembles @xcite .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to study the intermediate statistics for the conductance in mesoscopic systems .",
    "this has been a subject of interest both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "the problem of intermediate statistics is studied under the framework of dyson s brownian motion model of random matrices @xcite .",
    "the corresponding brownian motion model for transmission eigenvalues has been obtained by frahm and pichard @xcite using the polar decomposition of the scattering matrices .",
    "this problem of finding the transmission eigenvalue statistics for the crossovers is technically challenging , because there is no direct relation between the transmission eigenvalues and the eigenphases of scattering matrix @xcite .",
    "frahm and pichard have considered the model for equal number of incoming and outgoing channels and solved the oe - ue crossover problem @xcite .",
    "we extend their formalism to unequal number of incoming and outgoing channels for both oe - ue and se - ue crossovers .",
    "we show that the results for the transmission correlation functions correspond to jacobi crossover ensembles @xcite .",
    "we use these results to calculate the above - mentioned physical observables as functions of the brownian motion parameter @xmath0 . in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 limits ,",
    "results corresponding to oe ( or se ) and ue , are reproduced .",
    "also in the weak time - reversal symmetry breaking regime our results are consistent with the semiclassical predictions @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ secbm ]",
    "we make use of the brownian motion model to obtain the jpd of transmission eigenvalues in the crossover regimes . in section [ seccc ]",
    "we introduce the two - point kernels which are used to calculate the @xmath7-level correlation functions . also , we express the averages and variances of conductance and shot - noise power in terms of moments involving these kernels . in section [ secou ]",
    "we consider the oe - ue crossover and give the explicit expression for the density of transmission eigenvalues .",
    "this generalizes the result available for the ue @xcite to the crossover . using the landauer - bttiker formalism @xcite we find the exact results for the above mentioned physical quantities for the transition .",
    "section [ secsu ] consists of similar results for the se - ue crossover . in section [ secsc ]",
    "we compare our results with semiclassical predictions in the weak symmetry breaking regime .",
    "section [ secucf ] deals with the phenomenon of universal fluctuations , where we compare the variances of conductance and shot - noise power for the oe - ue and se - ue crossovers .",
    "we conclude in section [ secc ] with some general discussion .",
    "derivation of the skew - orthogonal polynomials and the associated two - point kernels are given in the appendices .",
    "in this section we first consider transitions to all three invariant ensembles oe , ue , se .",
    "we use the parameter @xmath8 with values 1 , 2 , 4 respectively for the three cases . in the later part of this section as well as in the rest of the paper",
    "we specialize to the case of @xmath9 .",
    "the scattering matrix @xmath3 for the conductance problem has the standard decomposition in terms of reflection matrices @xmath10 and transmission matrices @xmath11 as @xcite @xmath12 here @xmath13 and @xmath14 refer to the number of modes in the left and right leads connected to the cavity .",
    "so the matrices @xmath15 and @xmath16 correspond to the reflection from left to left and right to right respectively . similarly @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent the transmission from left to right and right to left respectively .",
    "the scattering matrix @xmath3 is thus @xmath19 dimensional .",
    "also we write @xmath20 . as a consequence of unitarity of @xmath3 , the hermitian matrices @xmath21 and @xmath22 have @xmath23 common eigenvalues @xmath24 with values between @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we denote the set of these transmission eigenvalues as @xmath27 .    for considering the transition problem it is assumed that the evolution of @xmath3 takes place as @xmath28 where @xmath29 , independent for each @xmath0 , belongs to one of the invariant classes of gaussian ensembles of random matrices @xcite .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the jpd of transmission eigenvalues @xmath30 obeys the following fokker - planck equation : @xmath31 in the above equation the fokker - planck operator @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 with @xmath34.\\ ] ] here @xmath35 is the vandermonde determinant .",

    "a , we give the relevant results for the jacobi polynomials .",

    "@xmath68 is an antisymmetric function which can be obtained from its @xmath69 counterpart using the one - body operators introduced in @xcite ; see appendix b. the indices @xmath70 take the values from 1 to @xmath23 or @xmath71 depending on whether @xmath23 is even or odd respectively .",
    "when @xmath23 is even @xmath72 is simply @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively for the orthogonal and symplectic cases . for odd @xmath23 one has to introduce additional term @xmath75 for oe - ue crossover as discussed in appendix b. in the se kramers degeneracy requires the levels to be doubly degenerate ; thus we choose both @xmath13 and @xmath14 to be even so that @xmath23 is always even .",
    "for the calculation of @xmath7-level correlation function @xmath76 , given by @xmath77 we need the two - point kernels @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , which in turn depend on the weighted skew - orthogonal polynomials @xmath81 and the integrated ( dual ) functions @xmath82 @xcite .",

    ".    landauer - bttiker formalism @xcite enables us to determine a variety of transport properties of the mesoscopic cavities using the statistics of transmission eigenvalues .",
    "of particular interest are the observables which are linear statistics on the transmission eigenvalues , such as conductance and shot noise .",
    "these are quantities which do not contain products of different eigenvalues .",
    "we start with the dimensionless conductance which , at zero temperature , is given by the landauer formula @xcite @xmath99 thus it follows that the average conductance is given by @xmath100 next we consider the shot noise .",
    "these are the time - dependent fluctuations caused due to the quantum nature of electron charge , and persist down to zero temperature .",
    "the expression for the shot - noise power ( dimensionless ) is known due to bttiker @xcite as @xmath101 from this we obtain the average shot - noise power @xmath102 the variance of conductance is given by @xmath103 finally we have the variance of shot - noise power , @xmath104    the correlation functions for oe , ue and se have been given explicitly in terms of jacobi polynomials in @xcite .",
    "using these one can work out the above mentioned averages which have been obtained earlier by other methods @xcite .",

    "however the expression is somewhat simpler , given by @xmath111 also when @xmath112 , the exact expression for @xmath66 is given by @xmath113 and for @xmath114 by @xmath115 for large",

    "we remark that these relations will also be obtained in sections [ secou ] and [ secsu ] as @xmath119 and @xmath120 limits of the transition results .",
    "note moreover that the initial jpd for se - ue transition contains explicitly doubly degenerate levels and therefore the above quantities should be suitably modified for @xmath114 when used in section [ secsu ] .",
    "we consider here the oe - ue transition and calculate the above physical quantities as functions of brownian motion parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the initial jpd of eigenvalues ( in terms of @xmath53 ) for this crossover ( corresponding to oe ) can be found by setting @xmath66 in ( [ peqx ] ) .",
    "thus the weight function appearing in ( [ ptrans ] ) in this case is @xmath121 and the crossover in the weight function is from @xmath122 for oe to @xmath123 for ue .",
    "the jpd of eigenvalues for the transition can thus be read from ( [ ptrans ] ) . moreover",
    "all the two - point kernels can be worked out exactly giving thereby the correlation functions of all orders .",
    "see appendices d and g for explicit expressions . using these one can work out @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and other moments as mentioned earlier .",

    "the level density @xmath128 ( normalized to @xmath23 ) for transmission eigenvalues is found to be @xmath129 valid for both even and odd @xmath23 . here",
    ", on the rhs , the @xmath0-independent term , i.e. the first term , corresponds to the ue .",
    "the @xmath0-dependent term is the correction term which contributes in the non - equilibrium regime @xmath130 .",
    "this term is what leads to the weak - localization correction in the average of quantities which form linear statistics on transmission eigenvalues . for @xmath6 ,",
    "this term disappears completely and we retrieve the well known expression of level density for the ue @xcite .    in the weak - localization study of relevant physical observables in mesoscopic systems",
    "the quantities are expressed in terms of diffuson and cooperon contributions @xcite .",
    "these correspond respectively to the time - reversal symmetry independent and dependent parts .",
    "the @xmath0-independent and dependent terms in ( [ tdens_ou ] ) can be viewed as the analogues of the diffuson and cooperon contributions .    for @xmath131 and with fixed ratio @xmath132 the density",
    "is given for all @xmath0 by @xcite @xmath133    where @xmath134    the densities for various values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are shown in figure 1 as functions of @xmath0 . in figure 1(e ) the densities vanish below some critical @xmath127 values which are somewhat smaller than @xmath135 predicted by ( [ tc ] ) ; this is because @xmath136 is not large enough . in figure 1(f )",
    "the densities for all @xmath0 are close to that given by ( [ asymdens ] ) because @xmath137 is significantly large .",
    "the average conductance is obtained , by using the value of @xmath124 in ( [ gx ] ) along with the substitution @xmath20 and @xmath138 , as @xmath139 recall also that @xmath140 .",
    "similarly , substituting the value of @xmath125 in ( [ px ] ) gives the average shot - noise power as @xmath141 the variance of conductance for oe - ue crossover is obtained from ( [ vargxy ] ) as @xmath142 the exact crossover result for the variance of shot - noise power can be obtained from ( [ varpxy ] ) but it is too lengthy to be presented here .",
    "we give the asymptotic result in section [ secucf ] .    as expected , these results match with the results ( [ g_beta])-([varg_beta ] ) for @xmath143 in the limits @xmath119 and @xmath144 respectively . for @xmath145 , ( [ gt - o ] ) and ( [ vargt - o ] ) give back the corresponding results of frahm and pichard @xcite .",
    "it is clear from the results ( [ gt - o])-([vargt - o ] ) that @xmath146 serves as the natural transition parameter for the problem .",
    "thus for large @xmath116 non - trivial crossover is obtained when @xmath147 .",
    "the fact that the transition parameter scales as @xmath148 is not surprising .",
    "it is known , for example , in circular and gaussian ensembles @xcite that the global properties such as the level density and variances of low - order traces scale in a similar way .",
    "this is in contrast to the local fluctuation properties , for example the spacing distribution and the number variance , where the transition occurs for @xmath149 @xcite .",
    "we also mention that the @xmath0-dependent terms give rise to @xmath150 corrections .",
    "by @xmath151 correction we mean @xmath152 with respect to the leading term . ] ( the weak - localization corrections ) in the respective leading terms of ( [ gt - o ] ) and ( [ snpt - o ] ) .",
    "the symmetric case of @xmath153 has been studied by many authors .",
    "the average conductance in this case is given by @xmath154 which yields the universal value @xmath155 for the weak - localization correction in the limit @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "also in the expression of average shot - noise power given by ( [ snpt - o ] ) , the first @xmath0-dependent term vanishes identically , whereas the last two terms cancel each other . as a result",
    "no weak - localization correction is obtained in the average shot - noise power .",
    "this is in agreement with the earlier predictions of absence of weak - localization correction in average shot - noise power in the symmetric case @xcite .",
    "the variances of conductance and shot - noise power in the asymptotic limit lead to universal results and is considered in section [ secucf ] .",
    "in this section we consider the se - ue crossover .",
    "since we have to take into account kramers degeneracy , the initial jpd can not be obtained by direct substitution of @xmath114 in ( [ peqx ] ) .",
    "rather we need to consider @xmath156 and @xmath157 along with the introduction of @xmath158 functions to take care of degeneracy .",
    "thus there are total of @xmath159 eigenvalues at @xmath69 , each of them two - fold degenerate .",
    "as soon as @xmath160 the degeneracy is broken and we have @xmath23 distinct eigenvalues .",
    "it turns out that the initial weight function for this crossover is @xmath161 .",
    "the jpd of eigenvalues in this case is thus given by ( [ ptrans ] ) with @xmath162 .",
    "also the expressions for the two - point kernels can again be obtained exactly and then @xmath83 can be written down ( see appendices d and h ) .",
    "we get the following expression for the level density @xmath128 for transmission eigenvalues in this case : @xmath163 again as in the oe - ue case the first term in the above equation corresponds to the ue and the second term is responsible for the weak - antilocalization corrections .",
    "the similarity between ( [ tdens_ou ] ) and ( [ tdens_su ] ) is noteworthy ; the two expressions are identical looking except for the interchange of @xmath164 and @xmath165 in the factors @xmath166 and @xmath167 inside the double summation . for large @xmath116 and fixed @xmath132",
    ", we obtain again ( [ asymdens ] ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the densities for different @xmath116 values as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "again , as in figure 1(e ) , the densities in figure 2(e ) vanish below certain critical values .",
    "also , as can be seen from figure 2(f ) , for large @xmath110 the density is again dominated by the first term corresponding to ue . however , in this case the oscillations do not die as rapidly as in the oe - ue crossover .",
    "we now give the results for the average conductance , average shot - noise power and variance of conductance for this crossover .",
    "the average conductance turns out to be @xmath168 the average shot - noise power is obtained as @xmath169 the variance of conductance comes out as @xmath170 again the exact expression for variance of shot - noise power is too complicated .",
    "we give the asymptotic result in section [ secucf ] .",
    "similar to oe - ue crossover the @xmath0-dependent terms lead to @xmath150 corrections in the respective leading terms in ( [ gt - s ] ) and ( [ snpt - s ] ) for large @xmath116 .",
    "the sign of correction , however , is opposite to that in oe - ue crossover , hence the term weak antilocalization is used .    in @xmath69 limit ( [ gt - s])-([vargt - s ] )",
    "agree with the known results ( [ g_beta])-([varg_beta ] ) , provided two - fold degeneracy for each eigenvalue is properly considered .",
    "for that , along with @xmath114 , we have to set @xmath156 , and @xmath157 in ( [ g_beta])-([varg_beta ] ) , and then multiply the results for @xmath171 , @xmath172 by 2 and the results for @xmath173 , @xmath174 by 4 respectively . in the @xmath6",
    "limit the degeneracy no longer holds so the above results match with ( [ g_beta])-([varg_beta ] ) for @xmath9 without any modification .",
    "we now point out an interesting observation for the oe - ue and se - ue crossover results for @xmath171 , @xmath172 and var(@xmath175 ) .",
    "one can obtain the results for se - ue from oe - ue results and vice versa by simultaneously changing the sign of @xmath116 and @xmath0 , and introducing an overall @xmath176ve sign for @xmath171 , @xmath172 . for var(@xmath175 ) one does not need to introduce the overall @xmath176ve sign .",
    "weak time - reversal symmetry breaking condition is achieved when @xmath177 , @xmath178 being the natural crossover scale for the problem . in this case , with @xmath131 , we get from ( [ gt - o ] ) , ( [ snpt - o ] ) and ( [ gt - s ] ) , ( [ snpt - s ] ) the following results for the average conductance and average shot - noise power for the two transitions : @xmath179 @xmath180 in the above two equations the upper and lower signs correspond to the oe - ue and se - ue transitions respectively .",
    "these results should be compared with the semiclassical predictions ( for the oe - ue transition ) for the average conductance and average shot - noise power when a weak perpendicular magnetic field is applied to the system @xcite , viz .",

    "thus our results are consistent with semiclassical predictions .",
    "we believe that the semiclassical analysis for the se - ue transition will also agree with the corresponding results in ( [ g_asym ] ) , ( [ p_asym ] ) .",
    "we have , from ( [ vargt - o ] ) and ( [ vargt - s ] ) , @xmath186 for @xmath131 .",
    "this is valid for both the transitions .",
    "equation ( [ varg_asym ] ) leads to the phenomenon of universal conductance fluctuations @xcite in the @xmath69 and @xmath144 limits yielding the universal values 1/8 and 1/16 respectively .",
    "identical result for var(@xmath175 ) for @xmath66 and @xmath114 arise in the large @xmath116 limit because we have explicitly considered the kramers degeneracy in se .",
    "it indicates that the variance of conductance in the universal regime does not depend on the spin - rotation symmetry and is sensitive only to the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "figure 3 shows comparison of the asymptotic result ( [ varg_asym ] ) with the exact oe - ue and se - ue crossover results .",
    "we now consider the variance of shot - noise power .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the exact expression for var(@xmath108 ) for the crossovers is quite complicated and lengthy .",
    "however for @xmath131 it has a simple form .",
    "we find @xmath187 valid as in ( [ varg_asym ] ) for both the crossovers . in the @xmath69 and @xmath144 limits",
    "it leads to the universal values @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "the exact and asymptotic results for the variance of shot - noise power are compared in figure 4 .    an interesting quantity which involves @xmath190 and",

    "it is clear from the expressions of @xmath190 and var(@xmath175 ) that in the crossover regime this quantity has , in general , a complicated dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "however for @xmath131 , one obtains a rather simple form , similar to above expression for var(@xmath175 ) , @xmath193 note that taking into account the degeneracy for se leads to identical expressions for the two crossovers .",
