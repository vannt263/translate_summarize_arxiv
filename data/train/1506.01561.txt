    "characterizing the territory covered by a brownian motion in two dimensions is a natural question , both in the context of the theoretical study of a bidimensional brownian motion and in ecology , where the trajectories of foraging animals are often satisfactorily modeled by a brownian motion  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it can be necessary to estimate the home range of an animal , defined as the two dimensional space over which an animal moves around over a fixed period of time  @xcite .",
    "ecologists frequently estimate this home range by computing the convex hull of the trajectory of the animal , i.e. the minimal convex polygon enclosing the trajectory  @xcite , and calculating its perimeter or area .",
    "the perimeter and the area of the convex hull of isotropic 2d stochastic processes have been extensively studied both in the physics  @xcite and mathematics literatures  @xcite . beyond the basic calculation of the mean perimeter and area in the case of a brownian motion ,",
    "the literature gathers various extensions , for example the case of @xmath2 independent brownian motions  @xcite , random acceleration processes  @xcite , branching brownian motion with absorption  @xcite and anomalous diffusion processes  @xcite . when the process is isotropic , the calculation of the mean perimeter and area of the convex hull can be conveniently carried out by studying the extremal statistics of the corresponding one - dimensional radial process , as presented in @xcite .",
    "so far , all these studies focused on unconfined bidimensional processes",
    ". however , the natural environment of animals is hardly ever unlimited , their displacements being constrained by natural or human - built obstacles , such as littorals , mountains , urban areas , roads ... moreover , the question of the impact of a confinement on the characteristics of the convex hull of a brownian motion is also essential in the theoretical study of brownian motion .",
    "recently , a rapid communication @xcite has addressed this question by considering the minimal model of a single planar brownian motion in the presence of a reflecting infinite wall that confines the brownian motion in a half - space ( see fig .  [ def_probleme ] ) .",
    "this confinement , though simple , is suited to model a river or a road that can not be crossed .",
    "the presence of the reflecting wall has a non - trivial effect on the mean perimeter of the convex hull .",
    "indeed , it was shown that this confinement produces a surprising non - monotonicity of the mean perimeter of the convex hull at time @xmath0 , rescaled by @xmath1 , with respect to the initial rescaled distance to the wall @xmath3 , and a singularity for a brownian motion starting very close to the wall ( ) .    in the present paper , ( i )",
    "we give all the details of the derivation of the mean rescaled perimeter , ( ii ) go further than this calculation , both by qualitatively and quantitatively studying the mechanism that produces the non - monotonicity of the mean rescaled perimeter , and ( iii ) focus on an additional observable , the extension of the segment of the wall that has been visited by the brownian motion .",

    "ii , we determine the mean rescaled perimeter of the convex hull of a brownian motion starting at a distance @xmath4 from an infinite reflecting wall , and analyze it for brownian motions starting from the wall and near the wall .",
    "we also provide details on the non - trivial question of the numerical evaluation of the analytical expression of the mean rescaled perimeter , and on the numerical simulations . in sec .",
    "iii , we determine the physical mechanisms underlying the non - monotonicity of the mean rescaled perimeter by studying the impact of the wall on two complementary parts of the convex hull . finally , in sec .",
    "iv , we focus on a subset of the convex hull , the extension of the visited points on the wall , that represents a further quantification of the convex hull , and analyze its dependence on the initial distance to the wall .     from the wall .",

    "the probability for a brownian motion to have a maximal extension larger than @xmath8 in the direction @xmath5 at time @xmath0 is the probability to have been absorbed before time @xmath0 by the absorbing wall mentioned above .",

    "quantitatively , we check that the lengths of these two parts of the convex hull are respectively an increasing function of the initial distance for the inward part , and a decreasing function of the initial distance for the outward part ( see fig .",
    "[ quant ] ) .",
    "these two quantities are defined as follows @xmath128 where is obtained from eqs .  , and .",
    "this graph also shows that the wall has a larger range of influence on the inward part of the convex hull ( approximately or ) than on the outward part ( or ) , as expected from the previous qualitative discussion .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the qualitative arguments given above on the two portions of the convex hull can also apply to the mean maximum of the trajectory . indeed , as presented in fig .",
    "[ nuage ] , the mean maximum in the direction @xmath5 is higher than the non - confined value in the outward directions , and lower than this value in the inward directions , for any @xmath5 . for the short initial distances , the increase of the mean",
    "maximum in the outward directions is substantial .",
    "the effective repulsion , which is a less obvious effect of the wall on the trajectories , is then important in the same way as the reduction of accessible space .",
    "nevertheless , as mentioned before , the effective repulsion remains limited to shorter distances than the reduction of accessible space .",
    "indeed , note that for , the reduction of accessible space impacts on the directions whereas the effective repulsion is quasi invisible on the directions ( see fig .",
    "[ nuage ] ) .",
    "parametrized by the angle @xmath5 , obtained from eqs .  , and .",
    "the dots represent the mean rescaled maximum for 3 values of the initial rescaled distance , and the plain circle gives the mean rescaled maximum for a non - confined walk ( which is ) . ]",
    "a further quantification of the convex hull is obtained by focusing on the length of the part of the convex hull that is along the reflecting wall .",
    "it is defined as the maximal distance between two points where the brownian motion has touched the wall ( see fig .  [ defext ] ) . in this section ,",
    "we determine the mean rescaled extension on the wall at time @xmath0 as a function of the initial rescaled distance to the wall @xmath3     for a brownian motion starting at a distance @xmath4 from the wall , represented by the plain blue segment along the wall . ]",
    "is the survival probability in the presence of the semi - infinite absorbing thick blue line .",
    "( b ) this probability is exactly the survival probability in an infinite absorbing wedge of top angle for a starting point located at a distance @xmath30 from the apex of the wedge with an angle . ]",
    "we first consider the particular case where the brownian walker starts from the wall and determine the mean rescaled extension .",
    "the probability that the semi - extension on the wall is smaller than @xmath30 is exactly the probability not to have touched the absorbing semi - infinite line along the wall starting at a distance @xmath30 from the initial point ( see fig .",
    "[ wedge_ext ] ) @xmath129 this probability is the survival probability in an absorbing wedge of top angle with a starting point at distance @xmath30 of the apex and an angle ( see fig .  [ wedge_ext ] ) . introducing as previously the rescaled distance",
    ", this survival probability is given by @xcite @xmath130 following the same lines as from eq .",
    "to eq .  ,",
    "the mean rescaled extension on the wall , which is twice the mean rescaled semi - extension , can be written as @xmath131 this integral turns out to be doable analytically and leads to @xmath132 note that this value is twice as small as the mean span of the trajectory in the direction parallel to the wall ( see eq .  ) .",
    "we now determine the mean rescaled extension on the wall at time @xmath0 for the general case of a brownian motion starting at a distance @xmath4 from the wall .",
    "if the trajectory does not touch the wall up to time @xmath0 , this extension is zero .",
    "otherwise , if the brownian walker first touches the wall at a time , the mean extension of such a trajectory then reduces to the calculation of .",
    "therefore , the mean extension of all trajectories is @xmath133 with the first - passage probability density to the wall at time @xmath134 starting at a distance @xmath4 from the wall @xcite @xmath135 eq .",
    "involves a convolution , so it is convenient to take the laplace transform of the mean extension @xmath136 from eqs .   and , we have @xmath137 and @xmath138 after inverse laplace transform , we obtain the rescaled mean extension on the wall at time @xmath0 as a function of the initial rescaled distance @xmath139 which is plotted on fig .  [ extension_courbe ] . as expected , this is a decreasing function of the initial distance to the wall .     of a planar brownian motion on the reflecting wall rescaled by @xmath1 as a function of the rescaled initial distance . ]",
    "in this article , we established a scaling expression of the mean perimeter of the convex hull of a brownian motion at time @xmath0 , rescaled by @xmath1 , starting at a rescaled distance @xmath3 from an infinite reflecting wall . by carrying out a thorough analysis of this mean rescaled perimeter , we demonstrated that it is a non - monotonic function of the rescaled initial distance @xmath3 .",
    "it means that there exists an optimal initial distance to the wall that minimizes the mean perimeter of the convex hull at a fixed time @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , we determined the physical mechanism underlying the existence of this minimum .",
    "we showed that this latter stems from the competition between two antagonistic effects of the wall , reduction of accessible space and effective repulsion , that have separate impacts on the two complementary inward and outward parts of the convex hull .",
    "furthermore , we considered a second subdivision of the convex hull into two complementary parts by providing an exact expression of the mean extension of the brownian motion on the reflecting wall , which represents the length of the part of the convex hull that is along the wall .    the problem studied here can be transposed to other dimensions , e.g. the mean span of a one - dimensional brownian motion in the presence of a reflecting point or the mean surface of the convex hull of a three - dimensional brownian motion , that is in this case a polytope , in the presence of a reflecting plane .",
    "the two antagonistic effects of the wall that we unveiled in this paper are not limited to the dimension two and are still at play in these situations .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that in the one - dimensional version of our problem , the minimum of the mean span with respect to the rescaled distance @xmath3 is actually located in @xmath140 , the effective repulsion being too weak to compensate the reduction of accesible space at small distance @xmath3 . in the 2d case studied in this article ,",
    "the effective repulsion is more substantial , yielding a minimum in the mean perimeter for a non - zero value of the distance .",
    "one could then expect this effect to be even more substantial in 3d , and therefore produce a minimum of the mean surface of the convex hull more marked than in 2d .",
    "nevertheless , the proof of this conjecture requires important modifications in the calculation and in the numerical simulation , as both cauchy formula and graham scan algorithm would have to be adapted to the dimension three , and thus remains a open question .",
