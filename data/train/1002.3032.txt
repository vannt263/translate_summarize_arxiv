    "the metallic phase of interacting three - dimensional ( 3d ) electron systems is described by the fermi liquid theory ( flt ) proposed by l. landau @xcite .",
    "the fermi liquid ( fl ) is a phase of matter in which low energy charged excitations and the long - distance behavior of correlation functions are essentially similar to those of the non - interacting electron system .",
    "they carry spin and are described as weakly - interacting quasi - particles .",
    "a microscopic justification of the flt was given through the many - body perturbation theory @xcite and the renormalization group ( rg ) @xcite .",
    "however neither the many - body perturbation theory nor the rg provide a complete demonstration of the emergence of a fl from an interacting electron model .",
    "the many - body perturbation theory neglects the competition between different channels and focuses only on the metallic phase .",
    "the rg analyses the flow of the interaction toward the fl fixed point , but it does not yield the quasi - particle spectra . furthermore , both approaches are restricted to the weak - coupling regime .",
    "indisputable fl behavior has been theoretically shown only for impurity models @xcite or model in infinite dimensions @xcite .",
    "recent development into this difficult problem involved the use of string theory @xcite .",
    "electron - electron interactions have a dramatic effect in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) metallic phase .",
    "no matter how small , they completely destroy the quasi - particles .",
    "an alternative to the flt for 1d metals is haldane s @xcite luttinger liquid theory ( llt ) .",
    "the central assumption of the llt is that the low - energy excitations and the long - distance behavior of correlation functions of 1d metals are similar to those of a model introduced by luttinger @xcite .",
    "these excitations are density fluctuations which propagate with different velocities for the spin and charge . in a luttinger liquid ( ll ) , unlike a fl , the decay of the correlation functions is non - universal .    there is a significant interest in the question of the evolution of the luttinger liquid when going from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "this is relevant to the physics of quasi - one - dimensional organic conductors @xcite where pressure or temparuture can induce a crossover from an ll to a fl or an ordered phase .",
    "the dimensional crossover has been studied by various approaches .",
    "these include analytic continuation from d=1 to @xmath2 @xcite , perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) on weakly - coupled ll@xcite or on 2d system with weak interaction @xcite , functional integral @xcite , and generalized dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite .",
    "these studies conclude to a fl ground state in 2d .",
    "however , anderson and coworkers @xcite have argued that , a different scenario due to strong interaction could take place .",
    "they pointed out that despite the rg being relevant , the resulting 2d system could nevertheless be a non - fl .",
    "the effects of the interactions could be so dramatic that if the transverse hopping is not strong enough , the electrons would remain confined in the chains .",
    "coherent quasi - particles would form only when the transverse hopping exceeds a treshold .",
    "this issue has recently been reexaminated in the framework of the functional rg @xcite .",
    "a regime with confined coherence was predicted in the strong interaction regime .",
    "the non - fl mechanism suggested in ref.@xcite could occur for instance in the vicinity of a quantum critical point ( qcp ) where interaction effects are very strong .    in this paper",
    ", we use the two - step density - matrix renormalization group method @xcite to study the possible emergence of fl and non - fl behaviors on an interacting electron model close to a qcp .",
    "our results are consistent with a fl ground state in a 2d model for weak interactions .",
    "we also show that as a qcp is approached , the system enters a non - fl regime .",
    "this is captured by the behavior of the exponent @xmath3 of the density - density correlation which shows a strong renormalization towards its fl value for @xmath4 and which is only weakly renormalized in the vicinity of the 1d quantum critical point .",
    "the evolution from a fl to a non - fl is also oberved in the low frequency spectral weight function .",
    "we concentrate on the following quasi - one - dimensional spinless fermion model on a finite lattice of size @xmath5 , @xmath6 in the @xmath7 , @xmath8 directions respectively :    @xmath9    we are interested in the situation where the hopping parameter @xmath10 along the @xmath7 direction is far larger than the interchain hopping @xmath11 , @xmath12 . the interaction @xmath13 is chosen such that when @xmath14 , we are in the ll phase , i.e. , @xmath15 .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to case where the electron density is at half - filling , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the total number of electrons .",
    "it has been shown in ref .   that this type of anisotropic model may be studied using the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the dmrg is applied in two steps .    in the first step ,",
    "we use the dmrg to construct an approximate , yet well controlled , low - energy hamiltonian @xmath18 for an isolated chain @xmath19 hamiltonian    @xmath20    in order to allow interchain dynamics , @xmath18 is obtained by targeting the ground state of the nominal filling @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the number of electrons on the chain @xmath19 .",
    "we also target ground states of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , ... until the lowest state of a sector @xmath26 is higher than the highest state kept in the @xmath22 sector .    in the second step ,",
    "the full 2d hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is projected onto the basis constructed from the tensor product of the single - chain eigenfunctions ; this projection yields an effective one - dimensional hamiltonian for the 2d lattice ,    @xmath27    @xmath28 is diagonal , its element are the dmrg eigenvalues .",
    "@xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are the renormalized operators in the single chain basis .",
    "these are vector operators made of local operators on each site of a chain @xmath19 .",
    "it is clear that during the passage from the first to the second step , this method is different from the conventional dmrg in that the truncation is not done through the reduced density matrix .",
    "the truncation is done rather like in the real space rg method @xcite .",
    "but if @xmath11 remains small with respect to the energy width of the states kept , as in the wilson approach for the kondo problem @xcite , this algorithm can retain high accuracy as we will show below .",

    "@xmath48    @xmath49 is obtained from @xmath50 by the using wick s theorem .    in comparing the dmrg to this exact result",
    ", we emphasize that although the exact solution is trivial in momentum representation , for a real space method such as dmrg it remains a difficult challenge .",
    "however , unlike the exact solution , the dmrg can readily be extended to the case @xmath51 without difficulty . in the dmrg",
    ", we kept up to @xmath52 states during the first step with up to @xmath53 .",
    "for this value of @xmath54 , the truncation error is virtually zero . among the @xmath55 states of the superblock",
    ", we kept a subset of up to @xmath56 states during the second step .",
    "these yield size dependent energy widths @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are respectively the lowest state and the highest state kept in a chain @xmath19 ( see table [ energydata ] ) .",
    "the key to retain accuracy during the second step is to choose @xmath11 such that , @xmath60 for a given @xmath5 .",
    "we show for instance in table [ energydata ] the error in the ground state energies for @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath63 . for @xmath61",
    ", there is an excellent agreement with the exact energy for all sizes shown .",
    "note that for the @xmath64 and @xmath65 lattices , the limitation to only 8 digits is due to the fact that we set the error to @xmath66 in the diagonalization of the hamiltonian .",
    "we could easily reach a smaller error without significant additional work .",
    "the agreement remains excellent for @xmath62 except for a @xmath67 lattice . at this size",
    ", the difference between the dmrg and the exact energies is two orders of magnitude larger . the crossover temperature from 1d to 2d is given by @xmath68 @xcite , for finite size systems in the ground state , this translates to @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the size - dependent lowest excitation in 1d .",
    "we find that if @xmath71 and @xmath72 , the accuracy is almost independent of the system size .",
    "for instance , when @xmath73 , we find respectively , @xmath74 . by respectively choosing @xmath75 , we obtained @xmath76 . hence , if we keep the ratios @xmath77 and @xmath78 constant , we can access the 2d regime in large systems while retaining very good accuracy .     as function the position @xmath7 for the middle chain of 2d systems : dmrg with @xmath35 , @xmath79 ( circles ) ;",

    "the local density @xmath85 ( fig.[local ] ) , @xmath86 ( fig.[gc ] ) , and @xmath87 ( fig.[gc ] ) computed with the dmrg show a very good agreement with the exact result .",
    "we verified that the asymptotic behavior @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 of the exact result is satisfied by the dmrg .",
    "for instance in fig.[gc](a , b ) , for @xmath86 the largest difference @xmath91 between the dmrg and the exact result is seen in the tranverse direction at the largest distance @xmath92 for which @xmath93 .",
    "the agreement is even better for @xmath87 , @xmath94 in the direction of the chains .",
    "for both the dmrg and the exact result , in the transverse direction , @xmath87 for @xmath95 falls below @xmath66 which is the error set in the diagonalization of the hamiltonian .",
    "hence , it was not shown . for this reason",
    ", we will exclusively concentrate on the correlation along the chains when analyzing the interacting case .",
    "for @xmath14 and @xmath51 , there also exists an exact solution @xcite .",
    "the model is in a ll phase for @xmath96 and in a charge density wave ( cdw ) phase for @xmath97 . in the ll phase ,",
    "the asymptotic form of the green s function is @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the anomalous exponent .",
    "the dominant two - particle correlations are the density - density , @xmath100 with @xmath101 . at @xmath102 , there is a 1d qcp . when open boundary conditions are applied , the sites at the ends generate strong friedel oscillations .",
    "these oscillations decay very slowly from the ends and interfere with the normal density oscillations @xmath103 .",
    "this behavior of the 1d system can be reproduced by the dmrg with extremely high accuracy .",
    "when @xmath11 sets in , it is expected that either the system will be dominated by the single particle correlation , hence the ground state is a fl , or the density correlations @xmath104 would freeze yielding an ordered two - dimensional cdw state .",
    "we did not find any evidence of cdw long - range order ( lro ) when we start from the disordered 1d chain .",
    "it is important to note that the same method was used to study coupled spin chains and found lro @xcite as expected .",
    "let us further discuss the reliability of this result . since the dmrg is highly efficient in the interacting 1d case , the level of accuracy in 1d between the cases @xmath35 and @xmath51 is comparable .",
    "hence , studying the full hamiltonian [ hamiltonian ] , which is no longer exactly solvable , with the dmrg is not more difficult than the @xmath35 case .",
    "the dmrg results of the 2d interacting case will be as good as those of the @xmath35 case , provided that @xmath32 does not decay sharply . when @xmath51 , an odd value of @xmath5 is chosen in order to not to frustrate the cdw correlations during the lattice growth @xcite .",
    "this choice also has the advantage of showing a sharp contrast for the behavior of the friedel oscillations between 1d and 2d .",
    "we find for instance that in the ll phase for @xmath80 , @xmath105 , @xmath32 increases from its @xmath35 value @xmath106 to @xmath107 .",
    "this implies that for the same value of @xmath11 , the accuracy would be better for the @xmath80 case than for the @xmath35 case .",
    "however , for @xmath105 and @xmath80 , @xmath70 increases to @xmath108 . for this reason",
    ", we have to increase the transverse hopping to @xmath81 in order to effectively be in the 2d regime .",
    "but since the ratio @xmath78 remains close to its @xmath35 value , the accuracy should not change .",
    "that is , we expect the error in the interacting green s function @xmath109 and the error in the interacting density - density correlation function @xmath110 .",

    "for the 2d system , they vanish in the bulk , the density becomes uniform as in the case @xmath35 .",
    "this is an indication that the dramatic departure from the free electron gas seen in the interacting 1d chain is strongly reduced by @xmath11 .",
    "this is consistent with the relevance of @xmath11 or the irrelevance of @xmath13 ( in 2d ) found in perturbative rg .",
    "however , a crossover from a ll to a fl would be less apparent in @xmath112 as seen in fig.[gc](c ) .",
    "this is because in 1d , @xmath99 varies only from @xmath113 when @xmath35 to @xmath114 at the qcp @xmath102 . at the same time the exponent @xmath115 , varies from @xmath116 to @xmath117 .",

    "@xmath193 ( full line ) , @xmath81 ( dotted line ) . ]    the pseudogap observed between @xmath194 exists for a finite range of @xmath13 .",
    "this is for instance illustrated in fig.([akwv15 ] ) where @xmath192 is shown for @xmath193 and @xmath81 .",
    "a pseudogap exists for both values of @xmath11 . for @xmath81",
    ", there is a shift of the spectral weigth towards lower @xmath176 .",
    "this is consistent with the possible crossover towards a fl at higher @xmath11 .",
    "in this work , we have shown that the two - step dmrg is a very useful tool for the study of quasi-1d models .",
    "this was illustrated in a spinless fermion model .",
    "we were able to obtain a very good accuracy on systems as large as @xmath195 .",
    "this is out of the reach of the conventional dmrg algorithm @xcite .",
    "the essential difference with the coventional dmrg is the separation of the two energy scales of the hamiltonian .",
    "the difficulty that arised in the interpretation of data was due not to accuracy but rather to the effects of open boundary conditions . in principle",
    "this could be avoided if periodic boundary conditions are used .",
    "however , we find that even periodic boundary conditions were not free of problem .",
    "when they are applied , the ground state is two - fold degenerate for even @xmath17 .",
    "this means that in constructing the 1d hamiltonian , additional effort should be made to keep tract of these multiplets .",
    "the computed low energy hamiltonian for a single chain is then less accurate than with open boundary conditions .",
    "the analysis of the correlation functions and of the low - energy spectral weight function revealed that a fl behavior occurs for small interactions .",
    "however , when the values of the interaction are close to the 1d quantum critical point , @xmath102 , the system behavior departs from that of a fl . a conservative view would be to infer this discrepancy to finite size effects .",
    "we did our best to disprove this possibility by showing that the decay of @xmath152 is essentially identical for @xmath122 and @xmath123 systems for @xmath80 .",
    "given the nearly size independence of @xmath3 between @xmath122 and @xmath123 , it is unlikely that the value @xmath196 at @xmath80 and @xmath197 would significantly change to reach the fl value @xmath198 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "these results could be explained by the unconventional ideas raised by anderson and coworkers @xcite .",
    "when @xmath199 , the ll would be unstable against any small @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting state is a fl .",
    "however , when @xmath194 , though @xmath11 is a relevant perturbation , there are no quasi - particles until @xmath11 exceeds a certain treshold .",
