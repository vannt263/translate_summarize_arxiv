    "we wish to apply this algorithm to @xmath78 to see if the shape of the resulting tableau has @xmath106 nodes .",
    "this is equivalent to say that at each step of insertion of a letter to a column the resulting column remains to be admissible .",
    "this in particular means that if letter @xmath122 and @xmath123 coexist at position @xmath124 and @xmath125 in some column of height @xmath36 , then we have @xmath126 let us obtain the minimal possible unbarred letter @xmath127 that could appear in the course of insertion algorithms .",
    "note that letters of @xmath78 lie in @xmath128 @xmath129 .",
    "since plactic relations of @xcite contain @xmath130 , a pair @xmath131 could create @xmath132 .",
    "hence we can set @xmath133 .",
    "the worst situation that could break is that there exist pairs @xmath134 for any @xmath135 in the first column during the insertion procedure .",

    ", we do not assume the rank is sufficiently large .",
    "so the algorithm can be used for any @xmath26 .",
    "however , we need to restrict our affine algebras to @xmath39 ( @xmath138 ) , since we use the automorphism @xmath46 . from the same reason we exclude the kr crystals @xmath139 and @xmath140 for @xmath141 and @xmath26 is odd .",
