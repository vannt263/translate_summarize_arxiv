    "vibronic sidebands are observed in the optical spectra of many solid - state materials  @xcite , with ti : sapphire @xcite and nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centres in diamond @xcite being good examples .",
    "the key point about a vibronic transition is that it involves the simultaneous absorption or emission of a photon and a phonon ( or phonons ) as the electron jumps between two electronic states .",
    "the sideband spectra are continuous bands , although sub - structure can frequently be identified due to the involvement of specific phonon modes , especially at low temperatures .",
    "for example , in the case of nv centres in diamond , clear structure can be identified that corresponds to the coupling of the electronic state to the a@xmath1 mode ( @xmath2  mev ) , giving rise to resolved side - peaks in both absorption and emission at integer multiples of the phonon energy  @xcite .",
    "the coupling to the vibrational modes is so strong that only a few percent of the emission occurs in the zero - phonon line , with most of the photons emitted from the sidebands  @xcite .",
    "the relatively weak intensity of the zero - phonon line has serious consequences for practical applications of nv centres in optical quantum information processing .",
    "the reason why the phonon sidebands in materials like diamond nv centres and ti : sapphire are so strong is that both the electronic and vibrational modes are strongly localized on length scales similar to the unit cell size .",
    "this means that the overlap between the electronic wave functions and the phonon modes is large , and hence the vibronic coupling strong .",
    "by contrast , ingaas quantum dots ( qds ) have envelope wave functions localized on much larger length scales that are determined by the size of the dot , i.e. @xmath3 nm . this means that the coupling to phonons is relatively weak , with the dominant interaction being to longitudinal - acoustic ( la ) phonons via deformational potential scattering .",
    "the weak vibronic coupling in these dots gives rise to very strong emission in the zero - phonon line , with only @xmath48%  in the sideband at cryogenic temperature  @xcite .",
    "this makes ingaas qds excellent single - photon sources  @xcite .",
    "it also ensures that the light - matter coupling is strong , with optical dipole moments typically in the range of @xmath5  debye ( @xmath6  cm )  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the relatively weak electron - phonon coupling leads to long coherence times that are ultimately limited only by the radiative lifetime  @xcite which facilitates their application in coherent control experiments  @xcite .",
    "this contrasts with bulk and quantum well samples , where the coherence time is only a few picoseconds at best  @xcite .",
    "the vibronic sideband in ingaas quantum dots manifests itself in a number of important experimental situations .",
    "one example is the emission of photons from a nano - cavity when the dot and cavity are out of resonance , with the emission involving either the absorption or emission of a phonon depending on the sign of the detuning  @xcite .",
    "another case is the observation of qd emission when pumping in the phonon sideband in a resonance fluorescence geometry  @xcite .",
    "the difference in the frequency of the pump laser and the qd exciton line facilitates spectral selection of the qd photons  @xcite and can be exploited for stabilizing the frequency of the zero - phonon line  @xcite .",
    "the sideband also appears in four - wave mixing experiments  @xcite .",
    "a key point about the experiments described above is that the optical pumping is relatively weak , so that the qd - laser system is in the weak - coupling limit . in this paper",
    "we explore the other limit where the qd - laser coupling is strong , such that a dressed - state picture is appropriate .",
    "this limit was addressed in a theoretical paper in 2013 by glssl _",
    "et al _ , where it was predicted that strong driving in the phonon sideband could lead to exciton populations approaching full inversion  @xcite .",
    "the predictions of the theory were confirmed independently by three experimental groups in 201415 , both for pumping of the neutral exciton and the biexciton  @xcite .",
    "most recently , it has also been demonstrated that the process works in reverse , so that an inverted system can be rapidly depopulated by pumping with a laser with red detuning relative to the exciton  @xcite . in these experiments",
    "the phonon coupling becomes strong when an intense laser field is present .",
    "the pulse durations in the experiments are short , and so the vibronic coupling is turned from weak to strong and back to weak again on picosecond timescales .",
    "we therefore call this process _ dynamic vibronic coupling _ ( dvc ) .",
    "the dvc is fundamentally different from conventional excitation schemes , such as coherent rabi oscillation @xcite and adibatic rapid passage protocols @xcite where exciton - phonon coupling is usually an obstacle .    in this paper",
    "we first review the process underlying the dvc and summarise the results from our previous experiments  @xcite . after discussing the experimental methods in section  [ sec : experiment ] ,",
    "we then present ramsey interference data to demonstrate that the mechanism of dvc is incoherent , i.e. that the exciton created by phonon - sideband pumping is incoherent with the pumping laser ( section  [ sec : coherence ] ) .",
    "we next consider the temperature dependence of the dvc in section  [ sec : t - dependence ] , comparing the population generated at @xmath7k to that at base temperature ( 4.2k ) .",
    "finally we show in section  [ sec : push me pull you ] how we can combine pumping with a blue - detuned and a red - detuned pulse to create and destroy an exciton within @xmath8ps .",

    "however , both of these dependencies are modified by the properties of the phonon bath .",
    "the exciton - phonon interaction strength is characterised by the function @xmath39 which increases with @xmath40 at first due to the rising phonon density of states , and then rolls - off rapidly beyond a cut - off frequency which is typically around 1 - 2 mev  @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of this cut - off is the point at which the phonon wavelength is comparable to the spatial fwhm of the carrier wavefunction . as a result",

    "the processes of interest for dvc both rely on phonon emission rather than phonon absorption , and are therefore highly sensitive to temperature .",
    "increasing the bath temperature increases the phonon occupation leading to a higher probability of phonon emission and thus faster relaxation .",
    "however , the probability of phonon absorption generally increases more than that of emission . as illustrated by the red arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : relaxation](a ) , phonon absorption ( @xmath37 ) causes the opposite population transfer between the dressed states to phonon emission ( @xmath36 - blue arrows ) and results in a lower final occupation of @xmath13 . as such , dvc processes are generally optimised by low bath temperatures in order to maximise the difference between phonon emission and absorption rates .",
    "the influence of temperature on phonon - assisted excitation is studied both experimentally and theoretically in section  [ sec : t - dependence ] .",
    "it is only by combining all of these influences that the full spectral and power dependence of the dvc emerges .",

    "the dvc may also be used to reduce the timing jitter of single / entangled photon sources @xcite or make tunable single qd lasers @xcite .    compared with resonant coherent excitation , one factor which limits the potential applications of dvc is the high laser power required to achieve an efficient phonon - assisted excitation / deexcitation .",
    "this problem may be solved by incorporating the qd into a nanocavity with a small mode volume where the light matter interaction is strongly enhanced @xcite .",
    "when cavities are involved , the knowledge of phonon interactions in the strong qd - phonon coupling regime becomes an essential requirement for a full understanding of the behaviour of optically driven qds .",
    "various recent studies have shown new physical phenomena that arise from this coupling @xcite .",

    "<S> the electron - phonon coupling in self - assembled ingaas quantum dots is relatively weak at low light intensities , which means that the zero - phonon line in emission is strong compared to the phonon sideband . </S>",
    "<S> however , the coupling to acoustic phonons can be dynamically enhanced in the presence of an intense optical pulse tuned within the phonon sideband . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments have shown that this dynamic vibronic coupling can enable population inversion to be achieved when pumping with a blue - shifted laser and for rapid de - excitation of an inverted state with red detuning . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the incoherent nature of the phonon - assisted pumping process and explore the temperature dependence of the mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that a combination of blue- and red - shifted pulses can create and destroy an exciton within a timescale @xmath0ps determined by the pulse duration and ultimately limited by the phonon thermalisation time . </S>"
