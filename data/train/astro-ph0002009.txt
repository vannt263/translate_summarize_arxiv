    "giant radio galaxies ( grgs ) constitute an unusual class of radio sources with projected linear sizes larger than 1 mpc=75 @xmath0 and q@xmath1 throughout this paper . ] . these objects ,",
    "although giant in size , do not stand out in luminosity , most of them being of low surface - brightness ( subrahmanyan et al .",
    "moreover , the enormous size of grgs sometimes hampers the identification of emission from two distant lobes as part of an individual object ( e.g. b2  1358 + 305 ; parma et al .",
    "@xcite ) . probably , these are the reasons why to date there are only about 50 known grgs ( ishwara - chandra & saikia @xcite ; schoenmakers et al .",
    "@xcite ) . only recently ,",
    "radio surveys like the northern vla sky survey ( nvss ; condon et al .",
    "@xcite ) or the westerbork northern sky survey ( wenss ; rengelink et al .",
    "@xcite ) allow sensitive searches of grgs with adequate angular resolution .",
    "two basic scenarios have been envisaged to explain the outstanding sizes of grgs .",
    "first , their lobes could be fed by extremely powerful central engines which would endow the jets with the necessary thrust to bore their long way through the ambient medium .",
    "second , grgs could be normal radio sources evolving in very low - density environments offering little resistance to the expansion of the jets . while the first possibility requires the existence of prominent cores and hot - spots , which are not always observed ( ishwara - chandra & saikia @xcite ) , the second possibility is supported by the high degree of polarization found in grgs also at low frequencies ( willis & odea @xcite ) and seems to be the most plausible scenario in most cases ( mack et al .",
    "it seems that the expansion of a radio galaxy in a low density environment during a time long enough to allow reaching mpc sizes , rather than higher than usual radio powers or expansion velocities , are the two basic ingredients to build up the grg population ( schoenmakers et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    grgs are located in regions hardly accessible via direct observations : they do not reside in rich galaxy clusters ( subrahmanyan et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the x - ray emission around their host galaxies is usually weak ( mack et al .",
    "however , information about the ambient medium at very large distances from the host galaxies can still be gained through the study of their radio properties .",
    "most grgs probe the intergalactic medium ( igm ) providing information about the density of matter outside galactic halos , adding important observational constraints to current cosmological models ( begelman & cioffi @xcite ; nath @xcite ) .",
    "we discuss in this paper new observations of the grg 8c0821 + 695 , a fanaroff - riley type ii ( fanaroff & riley @xcite ) .",
    "it is optically identified with a faint @xmath2 galaxy at a redshift of 0.538 ( lacy et al .",
    "its high redshift , compared to other grgs , renders 8c0821 + 695 a very interesting object since it provides information on the external environment at large cosmological distances .",
    "no x - ray source coincident with the radio source is found in the bright point source catalogue from the rosat all sky survey . at the distance of 8c0821 + 695",
    ", one arcsecond corresponds to 4.9 kpc .",
    "we observed 8c0821 + 695 with the vla in the framework of a complete sample of large angular size radio sources selected from the nvss ( see lara et al .",
    "@xcite for a sample description ) , and with the 100-m effelsberg telescope .",
    "we also incorporate for the discussion maps from the nvss and wenss , and maps presented by lacy et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the data have been calibrated according to the scale of baars et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "8c0821 + 695 appears as a straight @xmath37  long fr ii radio source in the nvss and the wenss maps , with its main axis at a position angle ( p.a . ) of 11 , measured north through east .    the wenss map ( fig .  [ lowres]a ) , at a frequency of 327 mhz and an angular resolution of 577@xmath4540 , presents two prominent lobes ( n and s ) connected by a continuous bridge of emission , although the position of the core is not evident at all .    the nvss map ( fig .",
    "[ lowres]b ) , made at a frequency of 1400 mhz and an angular resolution of 45 , shows a prominent central core straddling the two radio lobes .",
    "the n - lobe has higher surface brightness than the s - lobe .",
    "the mean fractional polarization ( @xmath5 ) at 1400 mhz is @xmath5=23% in the n - lobe and @xmath5=26% in the s - lobe , while the core is unpolarized .",
    "the e - vectors have a similar and rather uniform orientation in the n- and s - lobes , oblique to the source main axis .",
    "we observed 8c0821 + 695 with the 100-m effelsberg telescope at 10.6 ghz ( tab .",
    "[ obs ] ) in order to obtain information about the morphology and polarization properties at high frequencies .",
    "the observational and data reduction procedures were those detailed by gregorini et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the maps were cleaned as described by klein & mack ( @xcite ) .",
    "we made 40 coverages resulting after combining in a final noise level of 0.5 mjy / beam in total power and 0.1 mjy / beam in the polarized channels .",
    "the polarization maps were corrected for the non - gaussian noise distribution of the polarized intensity , as described by wardle & kronberg ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is of particular importance in case of polarized low - brightness regions , e.g. in extended radio lobes .",
    "the 10.6 ghz map ( fig .  [ lowres]c ) , with an angular resolution of @xmath6 , shows three components corresponding to the core and the two lobes .",
    "the superimposed vectors represent the electrical fields .",
    "since at this high frequency faraday effects are most probably negligible , a rotation by 90   immediately yields the direction of the projected magnetic field .",
    "it is oriented predominantly parallel to the source main axis .",
    "the degree of polarization at this frequency is 26% in both lobes .",
    "we also observed 8c0821 + 695 with the 100-m telescope at 4850 mhz .",
    "after combination of 10 coverages we reached the confusion limit of 0.6 mjy / beam in total intensity , while the noise level was 0.1 mjy / beam in the polarization channels . because of the large beam size ( 143 ) , this map does not reveal any additional morphological details , so we do not need to display it here .",
    "the degree of polarization derived from the effelsberg map at 4850 mhz is 19% in the n- and s - lobes .",
    ".observations of 8c0821 + 695 [ cols=\"<,>,>,^ , > \" , ]     the s - lobe does not present such a suitable morphology for the application of the previous simple model since the head of the lobe does not have a clear cone - like appearance ( see sect .",
    "2.3 ) . from the observed arm - ratio",
    ", we might deduce that the external medium here could be more tenuous than in the northern lobe region .",
    "we present new radio observations made with the vla and the 100-m effelsberg radio telescope , of the grg 8c0821 + 695 at different frequencies and angular resolutions .",
    "our data have been analyzed together with survey and literature data in order to study the details of a high - redshift grg , and obtain information about the external medium surrounding the radio source .",
    "8c0821 + 695 is a straight 2 mpc long fr ii radio source , with a north - to - south arm - ratio of 0.89 .",
    "the n - lobe contains a hot - spot , responsible for most of the source polarized emission .",
    "the s - lobe presents a more relaxed structure , without a well defined hot - spot . at high frequencies ( @xmath7  mhz ) 8c0821 + 695",
    "shows a prominent compact core .",
    "we have not found any trace of the jets nourishing the lobes .    the spectral index distribution over the lobes of 8c0821 + 685 is typical of fr ii - type radio galaxies , showing a gradual steepening from the outer ends towards the core .",
    "the mean lobe spectral index is @xmath8 .",
    "the core has a flat spectrum with @xmath9 . using the available data",
    ", we have made a spectral - aging analysis of the source lobes , providing the dependence of the spectral break frequency and the synchrotron age with the distance from the core .",
    "we obtain a mean expansion velocity of the jet head with respect to the lobe material of @xmath10  c , and a spectral age of 42 myr .",
    "this age determination might be affected by the possible existence of backflow of material in the lobe , being a lower limit to the true age .",
    "the age we derive for 8c0821 + 695 is of the order of ages estimated for other grgs ( schoenmakers et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we have studied the @xmath11 over the lobes of 8c0821 + 695 , obtaining a smooth and uniform distribution , which we ascribe to faraday rotation mostly produced by the galactic medium .",
    "equipartition conditions have been assumed in order to derive physical parameters of the lobes at different positions , yielding magnetic fields , pressures and energy densities that are consistent with estimated values in other grgs .    under very simple assumptions",
    "we have estimated physical parameters of the jet and the external medium of 8c0821 + 695 .",
    "we find that the present expansion velocity is significantly lower than the mean expansion velocity even if backflow is allowed , implying the existence of deceleration .",
    "we explain this deceleration by an increase of the cross - sectional area of the bow shock at the end of the jet with time .",
    "we note that external density estimates in the literature for other grgs usually consider the contact surface measured at the time of the observations together with mean quantities ( like the expansion velocity derived from aging arguments ) , resulting in external densities lower than the density we obtain .",
    "however , our results are still consistent with grgs evolving in poor density regions .",
