    "pressure or temperature induced neutral to ionic phase transitions ( pinit and tinit , respectively ) in mixed stack organic charge transfer ( ct ) complexes were experimentally discovered about twenty years ago.@xcite the discovery , which followed earlier theoretical predictions , @xcite triggered intense experimental and theoretical investigations .",
    "however , the experiments were slowed down by the difficulties connected with high pressure studies , since for a long time tetrathiafulvalene - chloranil ( ttf - ca ) was the only complex undergoing tinit . on the other hand , theoretical interest declined after a satisfactory and rather complete interpretatation of the then available experimental data was reached .",
    "@xcite    renewed interest on nit has been recently prompted by the discovery that the transition can also be photoinduced , thus shifting both the experimental and theoretical focus to the dynamical aspects of the phase transition and of its precursor regimes.@xcite furthermore , it has been pointed out that since at the nit the ionicity jump is accompanied by a dimerization of the mixed stack , the transition is at least potentially of ferroelectric type.@xcite this connection puts nit into a new and interesting perspective .",
    "as mentioned above , very few compounds exhibittinit in addition to ( room temperature ) pinit , thus allowing more detailed experimental studies . apart from ttf - ca and its variants , like dimethyltetrathiafulvalene ",
    "chloranil  @xcite or tetraselenofulvalene ",
    "chloranil,@xcite only two other ct complexes have been reported to undergo tinit , namely tetramethylbenzidine  tcnq ,  @xcite and more recently 2-chloro-5-methyl-_p_-phenylenediamine 2,5-dimethyl - dicyanoquinonediimine , .",
    "@xcite    aim of the present paper is to obtain a more detailed characterization of the tinit in , through micro - raman and polarized single crystals infrared ( ir ) studies .",
    "as shown below , in the crossing of the neutral - ionic borderline is different from the other known cases .",
    "first of all , there is no appreciable jump of ionicity at the phase transition .",
    "furthermore , the onset of stack dimerization appears well before the neutral - ionic crossing .",
    "crystals have been prepared by mixing saturated solutions in dichlorometane followed by slow evaporation of the solvent.@xcite the ir spectra have been obtained with a ft - ir spectrometer equipped with a microscope ( bruker ifs66 with a590 microscope ) . the mct detector employed in this arrangement",
    "limit the low frequency side of the ir spectra to 600 .",
    "the raman spectra were recorded with a renishaw system 1000 microscope with excitation from an ar ion laser ( @xmath1 = 514.5 nm ) . for both low ( down to 80 k ) and high temperature measurements",
    "we have employed a linkam hfs91 cold stage .",
    "crystallizes in the triclinic system , space group p1 , with a=7.463 , b=7.504 , c=7.191 , @xmath2=91.23@xmath3 , @xmath4=112.19@xmath3 , @xmath5=96.91@xmath3 , and z=1 .  @xcite the crystal structure is characterized by the presence of mixed stack columns along the @xmath6 axis , where the electron - donor ( d ) and the electron acceptor ( a ) alternate along the stack . the details of the crystal structure are not available,@xcite but it appears that at room temperature the stack is regular , that is , each molecule has equal distance ( ct integral ) with its two nearest neighbors along the chain .",
    "moreover , the stack structure presents disorder in the relative orientation of the two molecules : the 2- and 5- substitutional sites of are considered to be occupied by chlorine and methyl group with equal probability along the stack .",
    "vibrational spectroscopy is an important tool to study the ground state structural properties of ct compounds and of nit in particular , since the normal modes of vibration are probes of the local electronic environment .",
    "vibrational frequencies can respond to molecular charge variations , therefore detecting the change of ionicity ( @xmath7 ) implied in the nit .",
    "generally , @xmath7 is estimated by assuming a linear frequency dependence upon the molecular charge , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the frequency of the neutral molecule , and @xmath10 the ionization frequency shift .",
    "a shift of at least 25 can give reasonably accurate @xmath7 values.@xcite vibrational spectroscopy has been also the first investigative tool able to show that the nit is associated with a distortion ( dimerization ) of the mixed stack.@xcite the possibility of discriminating between regular and dimerized stacks through vibrational spectroscopy is due to the effect of the interaction between ct electron and the molecular vibrations ( _ e - mv _",
    "coupling).@xcite we summarize here the simple symmetry arguments which are the basis for this discrimination .    if the frontier molecular orbitals are non - degenerate , the only molecular vibrations which can couple to the electronic excitations are the ones belonging to the totallysymmetric ( _ ts _ ) representation of the molecular symmetry group .",
    "therefore , for a regular mixed stack made up of centrosymmetric molecules , no vibronic effects due to _ e - mv _ coupling can be observed in the ir spectra , since the molecules lie on inversion centers along the stack and the _ ts _ vibrations are forbidden . on the other hand , _ ts _ modes are raman active , so that perturbation effects due to the _ e - mv _ interaction are observed in raman , with a frequency shift of _ ts _ bands towards lower wavenumbers . in dimerized mixed stack systems the inversion center is lost , and the _ ts _ modes coupled to ct are both raman and ir active . in ir , they borrow intensity from the nearby ct electronic transition , and are therefore polarized along the stack , with an intensity proportional to the extent of stack dimerization.@xcite    in the case of the situation is more complicated , and we deal separately with the a and d vibrations . if one disregards as reasonable approximation the slight deviation from planarity of the ring with its substituents in , and considers the methyl groups as point masses , then the centrosymmetric @xmath11 group can be used to classify the normal modes.@xcite the distribution of the vibrational modes is as follows : @xmath12 in the isolated molecule , the ungerade modes are ir active , the @xmath13 being polarized in the molecular plane , and the @xmath14 out - of - plane , whereas the gerade modes are raman active . to the above modes , we have to add the 18 vibrations of the methyl group , which can be both ir and raman active , and polarized both in the molecular plane and normal to it .",
    "since at this level of approximation is centrosymmetric , the above considerations about the effect of _ e - mv _ coupling apply .",
    "we note , however , that the room temperature space group is non - centrosymmetric ( actually , it has no symmetry elements ) , so that in the crystals molecules do not reside on inversion center , and there is no actual symmetry restriction on the ir activity of the modes .    adopting the same criteria as in in the case of , we assume @xmath15 molecular symmetry for , so that the distribution of the vibrational modes is : @xmath16 and all modes are raman and ir active .",
    "totallysymmetric @xmath17 vibrational modes are polarized in the molecular plane ( perpendicular to the stack direction ) , and their frequency is affected by _ e - mv _ coupling both in regular and dimerized mixed stack.@xcite on the other hand strong vibronically activated @xmath17 ir absorptions polarized along the stack are expected only when the stack is dimerized .",
    "again , the 9 vibrations due to the methyl group can be both raman and ir active , with unpredictable polarization .    in view of the above , the degree of ionicity @xmath7",
    "can only be estimated on the basis of the @xmath13 modes , since all the other in - plane modes are perturbed by _ e - mv _ coupling , and the out - of - plane ones generally do not display a linear frequency shift with ionization.@xcite the onset of dimerization is marked by the appearance of ir bands polarized along the stack , at the same frequency of the raman counterpart .",
    "the analysis of the spectral region 1350 - 1500 is made difficult due to presence of the many methyl group bending vibrations , whose intensity may also change with temperature due to rearrangements in the methyl groups orientation .",
    "the room temperature raman and polarized ir absorption spectra of are shown in fig .",
    "[ rtspectra ] . for the sake of clarity , the polarized ir spectra in fig .",
    "[ rtspectra ] refer to two different crystals , the one relevant to the polarization perpendicular to the stack ( @xmath18 , bottom panel ) being obtained on a thicker crystal .",
    "the corresponding parallel ( @xmath19 ) spectrum in fact saturates completely in the 1200 - 1400 .",
    "the ir frequencies , relative intensities and polarizations reported in table 1 obviously refer to the thinner crystal .",
    "the micro - raman data do not give polarization information . since we shall not be concerned with the ch and nh stretching modes ,",
    "data above 2300 are not reported .",
    "the interpretation of the spectra takes advantage of the available assignments of neutral and fully ionized molecules.@xcite for a detailed vibrational assignment is not available , and the interpretation is based on the comparison with the frequencies of neutral and with the normal mode analysis of _ p_-phenylenediamine.@xcite the resulting assignment of spectra is reported in the rightmost column of table 1 .",
    "since the raman exciting line is in pre - resonance with an intramolecular electronic excitation of , @xcite we expect ( and find ) that the raman bands are for the most part due to @xmath20 modes .",
    "we remark again that the frequencies of these modes are perturbed ( lowered ) by _ e - mv _ interaction , so that they can not be used to estimate @xmath7 .",
    "[ scale=0.4]nit_fig1.eps    in the ir spectrum polarized parallel to the stack direction ( fig .",
    "1 , middle panel ) we notice a couple of strong bands below 900 , attributable to out - of - plane modes of and . in the spectral region",
    "1200 - 1600 one sees the clustering of many bands , also due to the presence of the methyl group vibrations . despite the difficulty in interpreting this complex spectral region",
    ", one can notice several peaks ( the main ones are marked by an asterisk in fig .",
    "1 ) whose frequency coincides with the raman _ ts _ bands . as we shall see below , the intensity of these peaks increases by lowering temperature",
    ". therefore these bands are due to the activation in ir of the _ ts _ modes coupled to the ct electrons , indicating that at room temperature the stack is already dimerized to some extent .",
    "also the ir band at 2167 has a frequency coincident with that of the raman spectrum , and migth be interpreted as an activated mode .",
    "however , its strong intensity casts some doubt on this intepretation . on the other hand",
    ", this spectral region appears rather complex also in the spectra of neutral and of its salts.@xcite in our case , in addition , the structure is disordered , and the c@xmath21n group is close either to the cl or methyl group , making plausible the presence of multiplets where a single band would be expected .",
    "the degree of ionicity @xmath7 can be evaluated from the @xmath13 bands appearing in the perpendicular ir spectrum .",
    "three modes , namely the @xmath22 and @xmath23 , exhibit a ionization frequency shift larger than 25 , and can in principle yield a good @xmath7 estimate . actually , the the @xmath24 ( c@xmath21n stretching ) has to be excluded from the list , since , apart from the above mentioned difficulties    [ scale=0.4]nit_fig2.eps    in the interpretation of the corresponding spectral region , its frequency is very sensitive to environment effects , and for instance changes appreciably just by changing the counterion in the alkaline salts.@xcite according to lunardi and pecile  @xcite , the @xmath25 mode should be preferred to the @xmath26 since it is not subject to duschinsky effects and its frequency has a nice linear dependence on @xmath7 . on the other hand , as already pointed out by ref .",
    ", in the present case we have the interference of a very strong @xmath17 band of at 1504 ( see fig . [ rtspectra ] , bottom panel ) , so that it is difficult to assess the frequency of the overlapping @xmath25 .",
    "we exclude the assignment to the band at 1522 , since this band is rather weak , whereas the @xmath25 has generally remarkable intensity.@xcite the @xmath27 mode , on the other hand , occurs in a spectral region free from other vibrational modes , and has a reasonably good linear dependence on @xmath7 .  @xcite we therefore use this mode as a primary reference for the @xmath7 estimate , and check for compatibility with the spectral region where the @xmath23 should occur . on this basis",
    "we conclude that at room temperature the degree of ionicity of is between 0.35 and 0.44 ( see below for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "we do not discuss in detail the interpretation of the remaining parts of the ir perpendicular spectrum , whose assignment is reported in the rightmost column of table 1 .",
    "we first discuss the change in ionicity with temperature , and for this purpose we report in fig .",
    "[ irperp ] the perpendicular ir spectrum at different temperatures in the spectral region 1250 - 1700 .",
    "we immediately notice that the nearly isolated band at 1570 , due to @xmath13 @xmath26 mode , shows a remarkable frequency shift towards lower wavenumbers , opposite to the usual thermal hardening presented by the other vibrational bands .",
    "if we use this frequency to estimate @xmath7 , as made in ref . and discussed in the previous section , the red shift indicates a change in ionicity from @xmath28 0.34 at 298 k to @xmath28 0.57 at 80 k. we have also increased the temperature up to 400 k ( sample sublimation starts already above 320 k ) , and @xmath29 0.30 at this temperature . since the spectral region of the @xmath27 mode is free from overlapping with other modes , the temperature evolution of the corresponding frequency allows us to follow the change in @xmath7 , as reported in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ rhodim ] .",
    "the figure clearly shows that @xmath7 changes smoothly with temperature . we have not observed hysteresis .",
    "furthermore , the simultaneous presence of neutral and ionic domains can be excluded , since we always observe a single band throughout all the temperature range .",
    "we now look for the other @xmath7 diagnostic mode , @xmath25 , whose presence is obscured by the strong band due to @xmath30 mode , located at 1508 in the neutral molecule .",
    "at room temperature one sees    [ scale=0.5]nit_fig3.eps    0.3truecm    a doublet in this spectral region , at 1504 and 1511 , that we tentatively assign to the @xmath30 and @xmath25 , respectively . by lowering temperature , the doublet coalesces in a single broad band , from which a structure grows on the low frequency side .",
    "we consider a small hardening of the 1504 band to 1506 at 80 k , and assign the low frequency band ( 1496 at 80 k ) to @xmath25 mode .",
    "using these wavenumbers for the @xmath25 , we obtain @xmath29 0.44 at 298 k and @xmath28 0.69 at 80 k , compared to @xmath29 0.34 and @xmath28 0.57 as estimated above from the @xmath27 mode .",
    "although the absolute ionicity differ by about 0.1 , the ionicity change from 298 to 80 k is very similar , @xmath28 0.25 .",
    "if we take the average between the two values , we obtain @xmath7 = 0.39 at 298 k and @xmath7 = 0.63 at 80 k. therefore , the @xmath7 scale of fig .",
    "[ rhodim ] might be off by as much as 0.05 towards higher values .",
    "a last observation on the perpendicular spectra of fig . [ irperp ] is the considerable hardening of the band at 1351 , assigned to the @xmath31 , which below 170 k melts into the nearby intense doublet , with an estimated frequency shift of 15 - 20 .",
    "the hardening is probably associated with the ionicity variation , in this case towards higher frequencies , but in any case we do not use this mode to estimate the ionicity since , as discussed in section 3.1 , the @xmath17 are perturbed by _ e - mv _ interaction .    upon dimerization of the stack , the _ e - mv _ coupling yields the intensity enhancement of the d and a _ ts _ modes in the ir spectra polarized parallel to the stack axis . in fig .",
    "[ irpar ] we report the temperature evolution of the parallel ir absorption spectra in the 800 - 1200 and 1380 - 1800 ( the absorbance of the frequency region in between saturates completely by lowering temperature ) .",
    "the _ e - mv _ induced ( vibronic ) bands due to _ ts _ modes are immediately recognized since they gain ir intensity by lowering the temperature .",
    "they also have their counterpart at the same frequency in the raman spectra ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the detailed evolution of the intensity enhancement of the vibronic bands is better followed through the @xmath32 mode ( 1006 at room temperature ) , since its intensity is easily compared with that of the nearby band at 873 assigned to an _ ungerade _ out of plane ( @xmath33 ) ir active vibration of , which does not show any spectral variation with temperature . in fig .",
    "[ rhodim ] , bottom panel , we have reported the intensity ( normalized to the 80 k value ) of this mode , together with that of the bands at 1417 and 1587 , assigned to the @xmath34 and @xmath35 modes , respectively . from the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ rhodim ] we again notice that at room temperature the _ e - mv _ bands are already developed .",
    "this residual residual ir intensity ( about 10% of the low temperature value ) of the _ ts _ modes puts in evidence that there is some degree    [ scale=0.38]nit_fig4.eps    of stack distortion at 298k , that is , the structural phase transition has already started .",
    "we have also verified that the residual ir intensity decreases further by increasing the temperature up to @xmath28320 k , but we could not go further since sample sublimation prevents the collection of reliable relative intensity data .    from fig .",
    "[ irpar ] we also observe the onset of two weaker bands in the low temperature parallel ir spectra . the first feature , which is still present in the room temperature spectrum as a weak band at 1138 , can be assigned to the weakly coupled @xmath36 _ ts _ mode , since exhibits a frequency coincident raman counterpart .",
    "the second spectral feature appears in the low temperature spectrum as a doublet around 1535 , in a region where no fundamental modes are expected .",
    "therefore , overtones and combinations are likely involved in the doublet observed in this region .",
    "the c@xmath21n stretching region deserves a separate discussion . in fig .",
    "[ raman ] we present the temperature evolution of the raman spectra in the corresponding frequency range .",
    "we have already remarked that at room temperature raman and ir spectra present more bands than expected . as shown in fig .",
    "[ raman ] , the room temperature raman spectra shows two bands . by lowering temperature , the high frequency band at 2168 decreases in intensity , but remains present also at 80 k , hardening to 2175 , whereas the low frequency band grows .",
    "moreover , we observe the onset of a third band at still lower frequency .",
    "we also find a counterpart of the above three low temperature raman bands in the parallel ir spectrum , indicating that they correspond to _ e - mv _ coupled modes . at present , we are unable to interpret this spectral region , where , as mentioned above , disorder effects may be important .",
    "0.5truecm    [ scale=0.45]nit_fig5.eps    we finally remark that several other minor features and intensity changes appearing below about 200 k both in ir and raman spectra are not interpreted .",
    "they might be due to some molecular rearrangments following the ionicity change , but at the moment this remains a speculative hypothesis .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , the vibrational spectra are rather complex , and their assignment is not obvious . the parallel use of raman and polarized ir spectra as function of temperature helps us to reach a satisfactory spectral interpretation .",
    "our data essentially confirm the previuosly given analysis of tinit ,  @xcite but the detailed study presented here offers a more extensive picture and puts in evidence new and interesting features of the n - i interface in this compound .",
    "as it is immediately evident from the top panel of fig .",
    "[ rhodim ] , the ionicity changes continuously with lowering @xmath37 . the ionicity change from high to low temperature turns out to be about 0.3 , of the same order of magnitude as in ttf - ca .",
    "@xcite in ttf - ca , on the other hand , the temperature evolution of @xmath7 is different : by lowering @xmath37 at ambient pressure , @xmath7 increases continuously from about 0.22 to about 0.30 , and at @xmath38 = 82 k there is a first order transition to @xmath39 0.64 .",
    "the first order nature of the phase transition is confirmed by several evidences , among which we cite the small hysteresis,@xcite and the sometimes observed simultaneous presence of n and i domains in proximity of the phase transition .",
    "the latter fact is evidenced by the presence of ir and raman bands due to both neutral and ionic species.@xcite on the opposite , in the passage from neutral to ionic side is smooth , and we do not find spectral signatures of different domains .",
    "we remark that _ all _ the so far known tinit s exhibit a discountinuos @xmath7 jump at @xmath38 , albeit in some cases the jump is rather small.@xcite another feature common to all ambient pressure tinit s is sudden dimerization of the stack at @xmath38 .",
    "also in this respect the behavior of is remarkably different . as shown in fig . 1 and discussed in the previous section , the stack is already dimerized to some extent at room temperature . the intensity of the _ e - mv _ induced ir bands , which is related to stack distortion , has the same s - shape as the @xmath7 variation ( see fig .",
    "[ rhodim ] ) .",
    "the point of maximum slope occurs in both cases around 220 k. given the already mentioned uncertainty in the absolute @xmath7 value , we can not say whether or not the crossing from n to i side also occurs around 220 k. on the other hand , @xmath7 can be considered an order parameter only in the case of first order , discontinuous phase transitions .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath7 changes continuously , the n - i borderline is ill - defined : from a theoretical point of view , the borderline is at @xmath7=0.5 in the limit of an isolated da pair , and at @xmath7 = 0.64 for a regular stack.@xcite in any case , it is clear that for the dimerization phase transition is already started when the compound is still well into the n phase .    the commonly reported picture of tinit is as follows .",
    "the crystal contraction induced by lowering @xmath37 increases the crystal s madelung energy , up to the point of inducing a first order ni phase transition . on the ionic side ,",
    "the system is considered to be intrinsically unstable towards dimerization due to spin - peierls mechanism , so that the ni transition is accompanied by stack dimerization .",
    "although the above picture explains the salient features of the so far known tinit s , it represents a simplified view , since it considers only the small ct integral ( @xmath40 ) limit , and disregards the role of electron - lattice phonon _ e - lph _ coupling .",
    "certainly , the phase transition can not be explained in the above terms .",
    "zero - temperature phase diagrams based on valence bond exact diagonalization methods , corroborated by experimental observations on several mixed stack ct complexes , provide a more complete and detailed picture,@xcite and allow us to rationalize the phase transition .",
    "first of all , the dimerization transition is attributable to the spin - peierls mechanism only in the case of fully ionic ( @xmath41 1 ) ct complexes like ttf - ba ,  @xcite namely in the large @xmath42 limit ( @xmath43 is the difference between d and a site energies).@xcite by decreasing the ionicity , the        charge modulation acquires importance , and the dimerization is better classified as an ordinary peierls transition .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ vbfig ] shows the calculated energy gain upon dimerization.@xcite the gain is maximum for intermediate ionicity , corresponding to a pure peierls mechanism , and progressively decreases as @xmath44 1 , corresponding to pure spin - peierls .",
    "we can then understand why the temperature of the dimerization transition increases with decreasing @xmath7 from 1 to intermediate values : it is 220 k for tmpd - tcnq ( @xmath39 0.9),@xcite and tmpd - ca ( @xmath39 0.6 ) is already dimerized at room temperature.@xcite finally , if the _ e - lph _ coupling is strong enough , the dimerization transition may occur also on the neutral side , as in the case of dbttf - tcnq under pressure.@xcite whereas the dimerization transition is induced by _ e - lph _ coupling , the @xmath7 variation is driven by the madelung energy , and is affected by the interplay of @xmath43 , the electron- molecular vibration _ e - mv _ coupling , and the ct integral . since the @xmath7 variation does not imply a symmetry change , we can assimilate the ni interface to the gas - liquid one , where we have a critical point beyond which there is no phase boundary.@xcite we then propose the following scenario for the phase transition . as pointed out in ref . , the ct integral in this compund is higher than in ttf - ca .",
    "since the position of the critical point for the passage from a discontinuous to a continuous ni interface depends on the ratio of the madelung potential to the ct integral , we might be beyond the critical point , so that the interface is continuous and @xmath7 is not a proper order parameter . in any case , at room temperature @xmath45 0.35 ( in ttf - ca @xmath41 0.3 when the nit occurs ) , and for such high @xmath7 the gain in energy upon dimerization  @xcite is such that the dimerization transition already starts around 320 k. the dimerization phase transition is very broad , about 200 k , and is in many aspects similar to that of tmpd - tcnq .",
    "@xcite tmpd - tcnq , on the other hand , is already ionic , and the @xmath7 change during the dimerization transition , if any , is very small.@xcite for the dimerization transition starts on the neutral side , and in such a case we expect that the extent of dimerization increases with @xmath7 .",
    "[ vbfig ] , bottom panel , shows the @xmath7 dependence of the asymmetry parameter , @xmath46 , as obtained by vb calculation for a set of parameters relevant to systems exhibiting continuous ionicity change.@xcite it is seen that @xmath47 , which is clearly related to the extent of dimerization , increases as the ionicity increase , reaching the maximum for @xmath7 between 0.6 and 0.7 .",
    "thus the dimerization represents the order parameter of the phase transition , but it is driven by the degree of ionicity ( assuming constant the strength of _ e - lph _ coupling ) .",
    "the above picture is highly reminiscent of what may occur in langmuir monolayers , where one has the coupling between a first - order phase transition ( order parameter : the area per molecule ) and a second order , orientational phase transition.@xcite an analysis in terms of ginzburg - landau theory of coupled phase transitions is beyond the aim of the present paper , but represents one of the most interesting developments in the study of phase transition .",
    "further experiments , including high pressure measurements , are in progress to confirm and extend the present results .",
