    "stochastic mass transport processes such as the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) or the zero - range process ( zrp ) proposed by spitzer ( 1970 ) are simple transport models for particle hopping to improve the understanding of basic phenomena in the dynamics of particles in driven diffusive systems .",
    "generally these particles are abstract and may represent objects from the microscopic to the macroscopic scale depending on the situation and their specific dynamics . just as these particles and their interactions , the underlying spatial structure is an important factor in adapting and mapping these models to physical processes . in this work",
    "we will consider two such processes , that feature the formation of particle condensates in periodic systems driven far from equilibrium .",
    "we are interested in studying these processes in a  situation , where the system is driven by the flux of particles entering and leaving through open boundaries .",
    "first we look into the zero - range process , where we can compare our numerical results with analytic predictions available from the literature .",
    "then we discuss the effect of open boundaries on the condensation phenomenon for an extended transport process with short - range interactions as realized by the pair - factorized steady states ( pfss ) model introduced by evans ( 2006 ) and wacaw et al .",

    "the basic stochastic mass transport process of particle hopping consists of a  gas of indistinguishable particles on a  one - dimensional lattice with @xmath0 sites .",
    "every site @xmath1 can be occupied by any number of particles @xmath2 . in the zero - range process , in every time step of the discrete stochastic time evolution ,",
    "a  random site @xmath1 is selected , where a single particle may leave to a  neighbor with the hopping rate @xmath3 .",
    "that is , particles only interact with other particles on the same site .",
    "the direction of the hop is determined randomly , often with respect to rates that introduce asymmetric dynamics . for an overview of different dynamics",

    "the main feature of this model is the formation of a  single - site condensate consisting of all particles exceeding a  critical density @xmath5 for @xmath6 such that all other sites have an average occupation equal to @xmath7 .",

    "we also observe an increase of the average bulk densities with the square root of simulation time in phases ii and iii , while it is stable in the steady - state phase i. this growth in the bulk system can be easily understood when the system has a  long - range correlation between sites deep inside the system and the boundary sites .",

    "more specifically , does the sensitivity to the boundary depend on the shape of the extended condensate in the case of the pfss model ?",
