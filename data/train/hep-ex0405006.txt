    "the asymmetries of fermions in @xmath0 collisions at the z peak are related to the vector and axial - vector couplings of the z boson to fermions , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , or , more precisely , to the asymmetry paramater @xmath3 in particular , the left - right asymmetry , @xmath4 , i.e. the difference between the cross - sections for left / right polarised electrons divided by the total cross - section , is equal to @xmath5 . for unpolarised beams instead ,",
    "the polarisation of the outgoing fermions f , @xmath6 , is equal to @xmath7 .",
    "finally the forward - backward asymmetry , @xmath8 , can be measured from the distribution of the angle between the direction of the outgoing fermion f and the incoming electron , and it is the only asymmetry which does not require a polarisation measurement . from each of these measurements the parameter @xmath9 ,",
    "related to the weak mixing angle of the standard model , can be extracted .",
    "a total of 17 millions z decays into hadrons and leptons have been collected altogether by the four experiments at  collider between 1990 and 1995 . this huge statistics allowed to measure forward - backward asymmetries of all leptons and of heavy quarks , and the polarisation of the @xmath10 lepton  @xcite .",
    "much less events , about 500000 z bosons , were collected in 1993 - 1998 by the sld experiment at the  collider , but by means of the 80% longitudinally polarised electron beam , they allowed a very precise measurement of @xmath4 and of @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "if lepton universality is assumed , the parameter  can be measured from , the forward - backward lepton asymmetries , @xmath12 , and the @xmath10 polarisation , @xmath13 .",
    "results from these measurements are shown in table  [ al ] and they are all in agreement .",
    "[ al ]    the parameters  and  are measured directly by  from the corresponding @xmath15 s with left and right polarised electron beam .",
    "it is , however , possible to extract them from @xmath16 and @xmath17 measured at , and .",
    "@xmath18 [ ab ]    results for  and  are shown in table  [ ab ] , and compared to the predictions from the standard model fit .",
    "a discrepancy by 2.6 standard deviations is observed between the measured  and the standard model prediction , when combining  and  results .",
    "no discrepancies are observed instead for .    in fig .",
    "[ alab ] the results are shown in the ( , ) plane .",
    "the measured @xmath16 is compatible with  measured by  and the standard model , but the resulting prediction for  is significantly lower than the measured value .",
    "the combination of all the asymmetry measurements yields @xmath19 .",
    "but , as shown in fig",
    ".  [ sef ] , the most precise results , those from  and @xmath16 , differ by about 2.9 standard deviations . altogether , the @xmath20d.o.f . of the fit is 10.2/5 , which has 7% probability to occur .",
    "an impressive precision has been reached on @xmath9 from the asymmetry measurements at the z peak . a three sigma discrepancy , however , is still present between @xmath4 and @xmath16 .",
    "in general lepton measurements are in agreement with each other but not with quark measurements , even though the discrepancy would be below two sigmas if  measurements only were considered .",
    "a deviation of the z couplings to the quarks which shows up only in these measurements is unlikely . only a large systematic effect , either common to all experiments or much larger than the estimated systematic uncertainty on",
    ", could explain such a difference , if it is not a statistical fluctuation .",
    "finally , it is worth noticing that only few measurements are still preliminary , therefore it is likely that this discrepancy will not be solved before the next generation of experiments at future colliders ."
