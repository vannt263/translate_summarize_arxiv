    "topological concepts play a prominent role in our understanding of continuum gauge theories .",
    "an example of particular importance is the idea that for the true vacuum functional of qcd ( @xmath2-vacuum ) gauge field configurations of all topological charges have to be taken into account in the path integral @xcite .",
    "such statements however are difficult to formulate in a mathematically precise way .",
    "the topological charge is a concept for classical , i.e.  differentiable fields , since only those fields can be uniquely classified with respect to an integer topological charge . on the other hand differentiable configurations are of measure zero in the path integral for the gauge fields ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    when formulating gauge theories on the lattice the notion of a classical gauge field configuration gets lost .",
    "however , various definitions of a topological charge for lattice gauge fields have been proposed ( see e.g.  the review @xcite and also @xcite for an overview on more recent developments )",
    ". using such a prescription one can in principle assign a topological charge to _ every _ lattice configuration ( up to so - called exceptional configurations which in the continuum limit do not contribute to the path integral ) . in a certain sense",
    "this makes the lattice approach very powerful for pursuing topological concepts since the path integral can indeed be decomposed into topological sectors whereas in the continuum formulation topological arguments are restricted to ( non - contributing ) classical configurations .",
    "the working hypothesis , that every gauge field configuration contributing to the lattice path integral in the continuum limit can be assigned a topological charge , allows to decompose the lattice path integral into topological sectors . as discussed above , in the continuum",
    "this is only possible in a formal way .",
    "the topological decomposition of the _ lattice _ path integral is a conceptionally sound procedure and allows to address many interesting physical questions in a mathematically meaningful setting .",
    "+ for classical gauge field configurations the atiyah singer index theorem @xcite provides a powerful tool connecting the topological charge with the zero modes of the dirac operator .",
    "however in the continuum path integral its value is reduced to formal or semi - classical arguments , since the classical configurations are of measure zero as remarked above .    on the lattice",
    "the situation is different . on one hand",
    "when approaching the continuum limit , every gauge field configuration contributing in the continuum limit can be assigned a topological charge . on the other hand we have no such thing as the atiyah singer index theorem on the lattice .",
    "however , in the literature several investigations @xcite - @xcite attempting to establish the index theorem on the lattice in a probabilistic sense can be found .",
    "if such a goal is achieved , together with the fact that the lattice path integral can be decomposed into topological sectors , this would allow to gain better insight into the behaviour of fermionic observables using the connection between topology and the spectrum of the fermion matrix .",
    "+ in this article we study qed@xmath0 on the lattice to demonstrate that a tight connection between topology and spectrum of the fermion matrix can be found and provides a powerful mathematical tool .",
    "establishing this connection is a two step procedure . in a first step we use analytic arguments to understand general features of the spectrum of the fermion matrix .",
    "in particular we prove a new theorem on the chiral properties of the eigenvectors of the fermion matrix , which makes clear that only the real eigenvalues play a special role similar to zero eigenvalues ( and zero modes ) of the continuum dirac operator .",
    "these analytic results can be generalized to the 4-dimensional wilson - dirac operator @xcite .",
    "once the real eigenvalues are identified as being the trace of the topological charge in the spectrum , in a second step we concentrate on analyzing their properties using numerical methods .",
    "tracing only the real eigenvalues is a much simpler task than investigating all eigenvalues of the fermion matrix . for sufficiently large @xmath3",
    "we establish results on size and distribution of the real eigenvalues and show that their number is related to the topological charge computed with the geometric definition @xcite . in a final section",
    "we make use of these results and use them to discuss the behaviour of the fermion determinant , the effective action and the pseudoscalar densities .",
    "+ the model under consideration ( qed@xmath0 ) resembles many features of 4-dimensional gauge theories such as qcd .",
    "in particular u(1 ) gauge theory in 2 dimensions allows for classical topologically nontrivial configurations ( ` vortices ' ) which play the role of the instantons of 4d yang - mills theory .",
    "qed@xmath0 has an anomaly which is related to the mass generation of the pseudoscalar singlet as in qcd .",
    "thus the lattice version of this low dimensional model is an interesting candidate when exploring the role of topology in lattice models .",
    "moreover for the continuum model there exists a limit which can be solved analytically .",
    "when setting the fermion masses to zero , the model reduces to the schwinger model @xcite for two species of fermions .",
    "this allows to check the lattice simulations and to gain intuition from the analytic result . for the case of",
    "massive fermions semiclassical results @xcite and expansions in the bare mass are available @xcite .",
    "+ the article is organized as follows : sec .  2 contains a short discussion of the model , the details of the simulation as well as definitions and theorems for the topological charge in the continuum and on the lattice . in sec .",
    "3 we develop the analytic results for the spectral decomposition of the fermion matrix and in sec .",
    "4 we analyze the spectrum using numerical techniques . finally in sec .",

    "the matrices @xmath23 are chosen as the pauli matrices @xmath24 .",
    "the fermions obey mixed boundary conditions , i.e. periodic in @xmath25-direction and antiperiodic in @xmath26-direction .",
    "this is taken into account by the mixed periodic kronecker delta defined as @xmath27 \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ \\delta_{x+\\hat{1},y } & \\ ; = \\ ; & \\delta_{x_2,y_2 } \\big [ \\delta_{x_1,1 } \\delta_{y_1,2 } + .... \\ ; \\ ; \\ ;   \\delta_{x_1,l-1 } \\delta_{y_1,l } + \\delta_{x_1,l } \\delta_{y_1,1 } \\big ] \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ \\delta_{x-\\hat{2},y } & \\ ; = \\ ; & \\delta_{x_1,y_1 } \\big [ - \\delta_{x_2,1 } \\delta_{y_2,l } +   \\delta_{x_2,2 } \\delta_{y_2,1 } + .... \\ ; \\ ; \\ ;   \\delta_{x_2,l } \\delta_{y_2,l-1 } \\big ] \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ \\delta_{x+\\hat{2},y } & \\ ; = \\ ; & \\delta_{x_1,y_1 } \\big [ \\delta_{x_2,1 } \\delta_{y_2,2 } + .... \\ ; \\ ; \\ ;   \\delta_{x_2,l-1 } \\delta_{y_2,l } - \\delta_{x_2,l } \\delta_{y_2,1 } \\big ] \\ ; . \\label{kron}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obviously @xmath28 .",
    "we are rather explicit here , since the analytic results for the spectrum of the fermion matrix in a fixed background configuration depend on the boundary conditions and also change whether @xmath29 is even or odd .",
    "the latter dependence can be discussed conveniently using @xmath30 .",
    "it has to be remarked , that when actually integrating over all gauge configurations the boundary conditions for the fermions are irrelevant for this model , since gauge group u(1 ) contains also @xmath31 . for a given gauge field configuration",
    "there is a partner differing just in the boundary links by a factor @xmath31 .",
    "the operators resulting from the grassmann integral over fermion thus are averaged over these configurations .",
    "we use lattices of size @xmath5 with @xmath29 between 4 and 16 . in the monte carlo simulation",
    "the fermions were considered with the hybrid monte carlo method @xcite . in order to ensure positivity of the fermion determinant measure we had to introduce a second species of fermions .",
    "we stress that we squared the fermion determinant only for generating monte carlo configurations , whereas below we analyze the spectrum and other properties of @xmath32 as defined in ( [ mq ] ) and ( [ qferm ] ) ( not @xmath33 ) . in the hmc method we used trajectories with 10 steps and a step size adjusted such that the acceptance rate in the monte carlo step was 0.8 in the average .    for the inversion of the fermion determinant even - odd preconditioning",
    "was used , together with the bicg@xmath34 ( actually bicg@xmath35 ) algorithm @xcite .",

    "the mechanism for this trapping is due to the contribution of the real eigenvalues to the effective fermion action , which is essentially the sum of the logarithms of the eigenvalues squared ( note that we squared the determinant for the updating ) .",
