    "the question of its origin , and relation with the formation of the cluster environment itself , can thus be more easily addressed at high redshift , closer to the formation of the first etgs and into the epoch of protoclusters , when the first relaxed galaxy clusters start appearing and the beginnings of the red sequence become visible @xcite .",

    "spectroscopic confirmation of high - redshift cluster members , and especially quiescent galaxies , is a difficult task , but required to convincingly demonstrate that a structure is genuinely evolved , with an established population of old galaxies . in this case , spectroscopic confirmation implies detection of the stellar continuum of the central etg population and thus requires a high enough signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , which is only achievable from the ground with very long integration times , either in the optical ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or in the near - infrared ( nir ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "further complicating matters , the main spectral feature of old stellar populations , the 4000  break , is at @xmath12 redshifted into the nir , requiring a sensitivity in this wavelength range that , until recently , only few instruments could provide .",

    "this ensured that the initial sample be complete and allowed for easier component separation in the case of blended spectra ( sources with s / n@xmath29 were still included in the contamination estimates , but not extracted ; see below ) .",
    "+      because the _",
    "hst_/wfc3 instrument operates in slitless mode , two effects conspire to make the reduction and analysis of the spectra more challenging : while the g141 grism has a resolution of @xmath30 ( with a pixel size of 46.5  and 0.13  in the cross - dispersion , i.e. , spatial , direction ) , each spectrum is effectively a convolution of an `` intrinsic '' spectrum with the spatial profile of the source in the dispersion ( wavelength ) direction .",
    "the actual spectral resolution can thus be significantly lower for extended sources .",
    "this results in broadened absorption or emission features and a lower s / n ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , rendering their identification and interpretation sometimes difficult .",
    "more importantly , a spectrum can be contaminated by spectral traces originating from sources elsewhere in the field along the dispersion direction , including higher ( first- and second- ) or lower ( zeroth ) order modes usually cut off or well - separated by ground - based instruments . while the response of the grism in these higher orders is at most 30% that of the first order in the usable wavelength range of the g141 grism ( @xmath31  @xmath32m@xmath33  @xmath32 m ) , and often an order of magnitude lower , higher - order contaminating traces from bright objects can still overwhelm the spectra of faint sources .",
    "even when contamination is not dominant , it can negatively affect spectra by changing the overall shape of the continuum or adding spurious features ( e.g. , emission lines ) , resulting in misidentifications and erroneous redshifts . while observations are usually done in at least two different orientations to mitigate this problem , here",
    "the density of sources around cl j1449 + 0856 and the depth of the data ensure that a significant fraction of spectra be contaminated in all three orientations .",
    "+ there are several ways to correct for contamination , which involve spectral modeling of the contaminating traces . at the time of this writing , the most sophisticated procedure implemented in axe , the `` fluxcube '' method , uses imaging in bands bracketing the grism , interpolating them to model both the spectrum of sources and the spectral dependence of their spatial profiles",
    ". the fluxcube method can be somewhat costly to implement , however , as it requires _ hst _ imaging in several filters with matching depths . as a compromise , trace profiles in the cross - dispersion direction",
    "can also be approximated as gaussian using information yielded by the direct image .",
    "in the course of the reduction , we have tried both the gaussian approximation of spectral profiles , which we found largely overestimated contamination , and the fluxcube method . in the latter case , as a workaround to the fact that _ hst _ imaging was only available in one band , we used the f140w image to simulate _",
    "images at different wavelengths by re - scaling each object , using the ground - based photometry and the segmentation image produced by sextractor @xcite as a mask .",
    "+             we found that this latter method worked well for sources with relatively high s / n .",
    "however , the contamination estimate is , in this case , entirely dependent on the quality of the photometry and can be biased by photometric uncertainties .",
    "since it does not use true multiband _ hst _ imaging , information on wavelength - dependent morphological variation is also lacking .",
    "even when other _ hst _ images are available , the quality of the spectral model will be set by the photometric sampling , especially around strong features like breaks which , because of the width of the filters , will be smoothed out .",
    "the contamination model is therefore always an ( often poor ) approximation of the real spectrum .",
    "however , calibration of the continuum is essential for those objects that have no or weak line emission , like quenched or highly reddened star - forming galaxies .",
    "the slitless spectra of these sources , especially faint ones , are thus at risk of being lost because of this sub - optimal contamination model . where the type and distance of a contaminating source are known , such as in the case of a star , a more accurate template spectrum can be used in lieu of the photometric based model .",
    "however , this is almost never the case , the vast majority of sources in a grism observation lacking prior spectral and redshift information . + to address this problem , we also tried another approach which forwent the models produced by axe , using only the science and error extensions of the 2d cutout , and dealt with contamination at the time of extraction .",
    "this was done by fitting each pixel column in the cross - dispersion direction with a combination of trace profiles derived from the direct images : + @xmath34 for any given 2d spectrum , the positions of the traces ( target and contaminants ) falling in part or in full within the aperture were computed from their relative positions in the direct image .",
    "+ @xmath34 object profiles in the dispersion direction were then estimated from the direct image , using the segmentation map to separate them . to account for dependence of the psf with wavelength , these profiles were broadened ( respectively sharpened ) at longer ( respectively shorter ) wavelengths than the f140w pivot .",
    "the variation of the psf across the wavelength range of the grism was measured from the uncontaminated traces of unsaturated stars in the field .",
    "+ @xmath34 the maximum continuum flux of the traces was estimated using the sources spectral energy distributions ( seds ; see * ? ? ? * for a description of the photometric catalog ) and the sensitivity curve for the corresponding spectral order .",
    "the background in the 2d spectrum was then estimated by masking the traces where they were expected to rise above the noise , allowing for a linear variation along the dispersion direction .",
    "+ @xmath34 each pixel column in the cutout was then fit as a combination of profiles at their expected positions .",
    "the resulting spectrum is then given at each pixel by the normalization of each source profile and the error spectrum by the uncertainty on the fitted parameters .",
    "+ for unblended spectra , the second approach yields results similar to the pipeline s untilted extraction although , by not making assumptions on spectral shapes , the residuals after subtraction of source and contamination spectra are lower than with trace models produced by axe ( see figure [ fig:2d ] ) . in the case of overlapping spectra ,",
    "however , it can distinguish between features ( emission lines , deep absorption lines or spectral breaks ) originating from one source or the other based on the trace profiles , provided the relative brightness difference be not too large ( on the other hand , one limitation of this approach is that here we assume a consistent source profile and thus , e.g. , , that emission features are distributed more or less evenly across the galaxies ) .",
    "we used this approach when the 2d spectra were severely contaminated or lacked emission lines ( e.g. , in the case of quiescent or heavily reddened systems ) .",
    "the extracted , contamination - subtracted 1d spectra in each orientation were first compared to each other , to check that they were consistent and then stacked before calibration .",
    "they were weighted according to exposure and wavelength - dependent contamination .",
    "the usable range of the g141 is 1.1  @xmath32m1.7  @xmath32 m . at @xmath35 and considering the spectral resolution , observable features include [ oii ] , [ neiii ] , h@xmath36 and [ oiii]5007  in emission , as well as the 4000  break and less prominent balmer lines , in the case of strongly star - forming or post - starburst galaxies .",
    "we have estimated redshifts for 140 targets in the field out of 474 objects with @xmath37 , with an average success rate of 30% .",
    "the remaining objects , for which we could not recover a redshift were either irremediably contaminated ( e.g. , aligned , in the dispersion direction , with bright sources such as stars ) , had no significant spectral features in the g141 wavelength range ( due to their redshift ) , or had too low s / n , either because of intrinsic faintness or low surface brightness .",
    "the success rate is high at the center , as shown in figure [ fig : success ] , and declines toward the edge of the field .",
    "this is likely due to higher noise because of the lower coverage and also to the presence of relatively bright sources ( low - redshift galaxies and stars ) near the edges of the field .",
    "redshifts were estimated in two ways : by matching the position of peaks in the spectra with known emission lines and , for spectra without obvious emission features , by cross - correlation with stellar population templates .",
    "+      spectra were first automatically inspected for emission lines with s / n@xmath38 and width that matched the effective resolution ( i.e. , the width of the source in the dispersion direction ) .",
    "those that were close to zeroth orders were ignored , regardless of any differences between the observed flux and that predicted by the contamination model . a gaussian fit",
    "was then done to the peaks and the centroids used as their `` true '' position .",
    "here we used spectra extracted by the standard pipeline , as emission - line spectra do not necessarily require a good flux calibration for the identification and examination of a spectrum in all orientations allows for differentiation between lines arising from the source itself ( which will be common to the different orientations ) and from contamination .",
    "two different quality flags were assigned to resulting redshifts : when two or more emission lines were found and their relative position matched , the redshift was deemed secure ( `` a '' quality ) and the uncertainty on the redshift was determined by the scatter of line positions .",

    "when only one peak could be reliably measured , and no other prominent emission lines were expected to fall in the grism range , the photometry was used to distinguish between possible solutions : first , a rough selection was done where the line was assumed to be [ oiii]5007  for sbzk - selected galaxies and h@xmath39 otherwise .",
    "these single - line redshifts were then compared with the photometric redshifts ( see * ? ? ? * ) . in six cases , where the spectroscopic redshift was incompatible with the photometry , we chose the bright line that yielded the redshift most consistent with the photometric one ( for example , [ oii]3727  instead of [ oiii]5007 , especially when @xmath40 ) .",

    "+         we have spectroscopically confirmed 22 objects at @xmath35 , including 5 quiescent galaxies , 2 emission line agn and 16 star - forming galaxies ( 1 dusty and 15 line - emitting ) , counting close pairs as a single source .",
    "images of the spectroscopic members , in the _",
    "hst_/wfc3 f140w band , are shown in figure [ fig : cutouts ] .",
    "in addition , there are 5 more galaxies in the range @xmath63 not in the wfc3 dataset but with ground based redshifts , for a total of 27 spectroscopic members , as listed in table [ tab : mem ] . + as shown in figure [ fig : map ] , the spatial distribution of galaxies in the @xmath9 peak is quite different than that of those in the @xmath10 one .",
    "they form a more concentrated structure , perhaps also slightly elongated in nature , although this could be an artifact due to the number of bright sources ( and thus potentially catastrophic contaminants ) being higher on one side of the field .",
    "galaxies at @xmath10 lie in a sparser , more extended and possibly `` sheet''-like structure in the background .",
    "+        the previous misidentification , and redshift distributions seen in figure [ fig : hz ] , can then be easily explained by the different observing capabilities of the two types of instruments used here and in @xcite : the field of view of fors and vimos is 1020 times wider than the extension of cl j1449 + 0856 , which is a few hundred kiloparsecs across and about one arcminute on the sky . moreover , as slits can not be placed closer than several arcseconds , these instruments can sample only very few galaxies in the cluster core and , instead , are more effective at revealing the presence of redshift spikes extending over many arcminutes . on the other hand ,",
    "the wfc3 is much more effective in handling dense fields , such as a cluster core .",
    "+ it is certainly quite common to see several overdensities in redshift space along the same line of sight , though in this case the cluster at @xmath9 and the _ sheet _ at @xmath10 appear to be very close to each other .",
    "the @xmath10 structure appears to be much less dense than cl j1449 + 0856 and to lack a red galaxy population . on the other hand , cluster and sheet",
    "are not gravitationally bound , being separated by @xmath64  mpc ( comoving ) . as this implies an infall time larger than the age of the universe , the two structures , while part of the same portion of `` cosmic web '' ,",
    "are unlikely to coalesce by @xmath65 .",
    "+ furthermore , we note that the slight redshift revision does not change much the mass of cl j1449 + 0856 : the intrinsic x - ray luminosity becomes @xmath66% dimmer ( @xmath67  kev@xmath68  erg  s@xmath3 , assuming the same scaling relations as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , corresponding to a mass @xmath69% lower , of @xmath70  @xmath71 , i.e. , within the uncertainty of the first estimate .",
    "likewise , the inferred radius does not change appreciably compared to our previous estimate as @xmath72  mpc .",
    "+    4000 index as a function of redshift of field and cluster ( respectively open and filled black circles , with the cluster stack as a light blue star ) quiescent galaxies , compared to other high redshift field etg samples @xcite as well as @xcite proto - cluster stack .",
    "error bars have been replaced by arrows for objects with s / n@xmath29 .",
    "the effects of low resolution on the @xmath734000 were corrected using the best - fit models to the g141 spectra . as a visual aid ,",
    "the dashed and solid lines show the @xmath734000 value , as a function of redshift , of @xcite single stellar population templates of solar and twice solar metallicity formed at @xmath74  and 10 ( i.e. , maximally old).,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    finally , we compare age indicators for the quiescent cluster members , individual and stacked , with the field sample .",
    "we find that the stacked spectrum is consistent with a stellar population of star - formation - weighted age @xmath75  gyr ( i.e. , a formation redshift of @xmath76 ) , assuming solar metallicity , with little extinction ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the strength of its 4000  break ( @xmath78 as quantified by the @xmath734000 index * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and that of the individual quiescent cluster galaxies .",
    "we find that these values are consistent with those of field etgs at @xmath55 in our sample and others @xcite , as shown in figure [ fig : d4k ] .",
    "in apparent contrast with some observations of lower redshift , more evolved clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but see also @xcite ) , there appears to be no detectable age difference ( barring metallicity effects ) between cluster and field quiescent galaxies . if true , this would suggest a similarity of stellar populations in already quenched galaxies in different environments at @xmath35 .",
