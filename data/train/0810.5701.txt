    "most approaches to optical pulse propagation rely on an approximation where the fields only propagate forwards .",
    "even the recently derived extensions of typical propagation methods used in nonlinear optics ( e.g. @xcite ) assume a complete decoupling between oppositely propagating fields to optimize the calculation .",
    "moreover , those based directly on maxwell s equations ( e.g. @xcite ) or the second order wave equation ( e.g. @xcite ) , are often simplified to work in the forward - only limit , where backward propagating fields are set to zero .",
    "this is despite directional decompositions of maxwell s equations ( e.g. @xcite ) indicating that _ any _ effect not allowed for by that decomposition couples the forward and backward waves together  and even creates a backward field if one is not present .",
    "usually we assume that a forward wave will not generate a significant backward wave via the diffraction because we are in the paraxial limit , and even then any generated backward component is very poorly phase matched evolving as @xmath0 , the generated backward component will evolve as @xmath1 .",
    "this gives a very rapid relative oscillation @xmath2 , which will quickly average to zero . ] .",
    "i compare predictions for propagation wave vector from uni- and bi - directional theories .",
    "such a comparison has been done for the more important case of nonlinearity - induced forward - backward coupling @xcite , and used analytical expressions for carrier shocking @xcite in concert with simulations to examine the effects of a uni - directional approximation . here",
    "my intention is simply to provide a complementary calculation to clarify the effects of forward - backward coupling induced by transverse ( diffraction ) effects .",
    "the result , while unremarkable , does clarify the bounds on the validity of propagation models using a uni - directional approximation .    since linear dispersion and finite nonlinear response times will typically diminish any generation of a backward wave , it is clear that any model which can be assumed uni - directional on the basis of this paper will be more so in practice .",
    "these results do not tell us whether the uni - directional approximation would be more or less robust for situations requiring vector fields ( e.g. @xcite ) , or for nonlinear effects such as self - focusing @xcite , or nonlinear diffraction @xcite but they at least establish a point of reference .",
    "most optical pulse problems consider a uniform and source free dielectric medium . in such cases",
    "a good starting point is the second order wave equation , which results from the substitution of the @xmath3 maxwell s equation into the @xmath4 one in the source - free case ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "further , assuming linearly polarized pulses , we can use a scalar form . defining @xmath5 and @xmath6 ,",
    "we can write the wave equation as   @xmath7    e(t ) & =    \\frac{4\\pi }         { c^2 }    \\partial_t^2    p_t(e(t),t ) .",
    "\\label{eqn - basic - nabla2e}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here i have suppressed the spatial coordinates for notational simplicity ; in fact we have @xmath8 and the total polarization @xmath9 ; also @xmath10 . here",
    "we will consider only isotropic linear media , which enables us to replace @xmath11 with a refractive index ; more complicated polarization behaviour is covered elsewhere @xcite .",
    "thus , in the frequency domain , we can write   @xmath12    e(t ) & =    0 .",
    "\\label{eqn - basic - nabla2ew}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    however , in most descriptions of pulse propagation we will want to chose a specific propagation direction ( e.g. along the @xmath13-axis ) , and then denote the orthogonal components ( i.e. along @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) as transverse behaviour .",
    "thus , splitting the @xmath16 operator into its propagation ( @xmath13 ) and transverse ( @xmath17 ) parts , we can rewrite the wave equation similarly :   @xmath18    e(\\omega ) & =   -    \\nabla_\\perp^2    e(\\omega ) \\label{eqn - bi - d2ze } \\\\",
    "\\left [      \\partial_z^2      +      k^2    \\right ]    e(\\omega ) & =   +    k_\\perp^2    e(\\omega ) , \\label{eqn - bi - k2e}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the total wavevector is given by @xmath19 ; the transverse component is @xmath20 .",
    "if we want to describe diffraction , then we can give the field some suitable beam profile @xmath21 , an even simpler case is that of off - axis one dimensional propagation , which requires merely a fixed value of @xmath20 .",
    "i now factorize the wave equation , a process which , while used in optics for some time @xcite has only recently been used to its full potential @xcite .",
    "factorization takes its name from the fact that the lhs of eqn .",
    "is a simple difference of squares which might be factorized , indeed this is what was done in a somewhat ad hoc fashion by blow and wood in 1989 @xcite .",
    "since the factors are just @xmath22 , we can see that each ( by itself ) would generate a forward directed wave equation , and the other a backward one . without going into detail (",
    "although see the appendix ) , a rigorous factorization procedure @xcite allows us to define a pair of counter - propagating greens functions , and so divide the second order wave equation into a pair of coupled _ counter - propagating _ first order ones .",
    "counter - propagating wave equations suggest counter propagating fields , so i split the electric field up accordingly into forward ( @xmath23 ) and backward ( @xmath24 ) parts , with @xmath25 .",
    "the coupled first order wave equations are   @xmath26 .",
    "\\label{eqn - bi - dze}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the rhs now falls into two parts , which i term the underlying and residual parts @xcite .",
    "first , there is the @xmath27 term that , by itself , would describe plane - wave like propagation .",
    "second , the remaining part ( here proportional to @xmath28 ) which can be called `` residual '' terms .",
    "these residual contributions , here containing the transverse effects , account for the discrepancy between the true propagation and the underlying propagation .",
    "although here the residual component will be only a weak perturbation in e.g. the paraxial limit , the theory presented here is valid for _ any _ strength . although my preference would be to use a directional fields approach @xcite rather than the factorization one used here , it is difficult to describe transverse effects satisfactorally .",
    "note that the work of weston examines this kind of wave - splitting with more mathematical rigour ( see e.g. @xcite ) , although without consideration of residual terms , and ( at least initially ) in the context of reflections and scattering .",
    "this theory was based on that from the earlier work of beezley and krueger @xcite who applied wave - splitting concepts to optics .      the scalar second order wave equation given above in eqn .",
    "trivially provides a total wavector for any given direction of propagation .",
    "this is simply a sum of squares of the parallel and transverse contributions @xmath29 and @xmath20 , so that   @xmath30    note the reversed signs between the rhs terms of eqn . , the transverse part retards the propagation given by the underlying part ; the net forward - direction wavevector for some @xmath20 is therefore less than the total wave vector  just as would be expected .",
    "now i make the uni - directional assumption and set @xmath31 in eqn .",
    ", so that we get a wave equation with underlying ( @xmath32 ) and residual ( @xmath33 ) components , i.e.   @xmath34 note that the diffaction term here is identical to that obtained by applying the standard paraxial approximation to propagation in a linear dispersive medium .",
    "alternatively , since there is no @xmath24 field to complicate matters , i might rewrite this wave equation using a new uni - directional wave vector @xmath35 to define _ only _ an underlying propagation , i.e.   @xmath36 where @xmath35 is   @xmath37 .",
    "\\label{eqn - uni - ku}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as expected , @xmath35 is not equivalent to the true wave vector @xmath38 ; indeed we expect it to be an approximation to @xmath29 , which specifies on - axis spatial variation of the exact propagation .",
    "in the above , we saw that the bi - directional and uni - directional models gave different propagation wave vectors .",
    "however , note that when @xmath39 , terms of order @xmath40 or higher are negligible . we can rearrange and then approximate eqn . in that limit",
    "so that   @xmath41^{1/2 } \\\\ & \\simeq    k    \\left [      1     -      \\frac{1}{2 }      \\frac{k_\\perp^2}{k^2 }    \\right ] \\quad =    k_u .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    essentially what the condition @xmath39 means is that propagation effects transverse to the chosen propagation direction must occur on a scale much larger than one wavelength , or else a uni - directional approximation will fail .",
    "it is important to note that the existence of significant forward - backward coupling does not always demand the presence or generation of a freely propagating backward wave .",
    "it is possible for the backward wave ( i.e. @xmath24 ) to be dragged along by the forward one , as seen for several example in the directional fields formalism of kinsler et al .",
    "@xcite . nevertheless ,",
    "although it such a situation might give an answer correct to within a suitable scaling , in such a case the uni - directional approximation is not strictly valid .",
    "i have demonstrated one of the fundamental limits on the widely used uni - directional propagation approximation .",
    "this was done by a simple comparison of wave vectors obtained from electromagnetic scalar wave equations allowing for all three spatial dimensions ; using both an exact ( and hence bi - directional ) model , and an approximate uni - directional model .",
    "these results are done in the same style as , and are intended to complement existing limits placed on nonlinear effects @xcite ; they are not intended to startle the reader with their novelty .",
    "i have shown that the condition @xmath42 must hold for the uni - directional approximation to be true ; even when no backward field is initially present .",
    "unsurprisingly this is comparable to the condition for the widely used `` paraxial '' limit .",
    "note , however , that the use of the paraxial approximation is rarely accompanied by a discussion of potential generation of backward propagating waves .",
