    "lhcb is a second generation b - physics experiment , devoted to studies of new phenomena in cp violation and in rare decays .",
    "previous experiments have provided extensive studies on @xmath0 transitions  @xcite , but a limited knowledge on @xmath1 transitions is available up to now and in this sector large space is still available for new physics ( np ) effects , beyond standard model ( sm ) .",
    "precision measurements of the parameters of the cabibbo - kobayshi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix have provided stringent constraints to the sm  @xcite , but these are much relaxed if we consider only tree level measurements .",
    "b physics at lhc has the great advantage of high @xmath2 cross section ( @xmath3 ) , with production of all species of b - hadrons .",
    "the challenge in the analysis is related to the presence of the underlying event , to the high particle multiplicity and to the high rate of background events ( @xmath4 mb ) .",
    "lhcb intends to perform extensive studies in a wide set of channels with the following goals :    * to improve the precision in the measurement of the angle @xmath5 and the other ckm parameters , searching for evidence of np from comparisons between tree level and box and penguin contributions .",
    "some examples which i will discuss in the following are the measurements of @xmath5 from @xmath6 decays , and the measurement of the @xmath7 mixing phase from @xmath8 and @xmath9 decays . * to search for np in rare decays from high precision measurements of branching ratios and time dependent cp asymmetries .",
    "examples are @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 decays .",
    "the start - up of the large hadron collider is now approaching and the lhcb experiment is completely installed in ip8 and ready for taking data . during 2008 lhc",
    "is expected to run at @xmath14 = 10 tev with a reduced luminosity , about @xmath15 @xmath16 , for about one month .",
    "these data will be of great utility for detector and trigger commissioning and calibration , they will also allow first studies on physics parameters like particle multiplicities and cross sections . in 2009  @xcite , in @xmath14 = 14 tev collisions , lhcb should collect around 0.5 @xmath17 of data , which will allow first results on cp physics and rare decays .",
    "lhcb has chosen to run at a nominal luminosity lower than the design lhc luminosity , around @xmath18 @xmath16 .",
    "this is to limit pile up of proton - proton interactions in order to help trigger and event reconstructions and to limit detectors irradiation .",
    "lhcb expects to collect 2 @xmath17 per year ( @xmath19 s ) integrating a total luminosity of about 10 @xmath17 around year 2013 .    a schematic of the detector is shown in figure  [ lhcbdet ] .",
    "a full description of the lhcb detector can be found in @xcite .",
    "i will just mention the crucial aspects of the expected performance which are a good spatial resolution ( @xmath20 m resolution on the impact parameter with respect to the primary vertex , @xmath21 m resolution on the secondary vertex ) and a momentum resolution @xmath22= 0.3 - 0.5% giving a precision on the reconstructed b mass of 15 - 20 @xmath23 and a b proper time resolution of about 40 fs .",
    "the cherenkov detectors system provides a good @xmath24 separation in the momentum range between 2 to 100 gev / c while the calorimeter system ( ps , ecal , hcal ) and the muon chambers provide good electron and muon identification .",
    "particle identification is of extreme importance for signal selection and background rejection in many exclusive b channels as well as for flavour tagging . for this purpose several algorithms",
    "are used , the combined performance is a tagging power @xmath25= 4 - 5% for @xmath26and 7 - 9% for @xmath7 , depending on the channel .",
    "lhcb has a two stage trigger , the level-0 is hardware and reduces the rate from the initial 40 mhz to 1 mhz , it is based on moderate @xmath27 requirements on muons , electrons , photons and hadrons .",
    "the following stage , called high level trigger , is entirely software , therefore completely tunable on different situations and using data from the whole detector .",
    "it reduces the rate to 2 khz , the output includes about 200 hz of exclusive b candidates and 1.8 khz of inclusive channels , to be used also for calibration purposes and systematic studies .",
    "the trigger efficiencies , normalized to offline reconstructed events , range from about 80% in channels with muons to about 40% in fully hadronic channels .",
    "the phase arising from interference between @xmath7 decays with and without mixing is expected to be very small in the sm : @xmath29 rad from unitarity triangle fits @xcite .",
    "new particles contributing to the box diagram can alter this value which becomes a sensitive probe to new physics .",
    "@xmath30 can be precisely measured from the time dependent asymmetry in the decay rate of @xmath31 using flavour tagged events . in the decay of a pseudoscalar meson to a vector - vector pair",
    "an angular analysis is needed to disentangle the contributions of the cp - even and the cp - odd components .",
    "lhcb expects to select 130000 untagged events in @xmath32 obtaining a sensitivity @xmath33= 0.023 rad .",
    "other parameters are determined from the fit with sensitivities : @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the fraction of cp - odd component at t=0 .",
    "several @xmath7 decay channels with cp - even final states have been also considered : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in one nominal year",
    "a total statistics of about 25000 events is expected in all these channels , corresponding to a sensitivity on @xmath30 of @xmath41= 0.048 .",
    "the @xmath42 result alone indicate that lhcb can provide already with 0.5 @xmath17 of data a measurement of @xmath30 with a 0.05 sensitivity .    within the sm",
    "the cp violation effects in @xmath43 are expected to be smaller than 1% , due to a cancellation between the mixing and the penguin phases .",
    "the observation of a significant cp violating phase in this decay mode would indeed be due to the presence of np giving different contributions to the box and penguin diagrams . in lhcb",
    "it is expected that about 3100 signal events will be selected in this channel in @xmath32 , with a background to signal ratio below 0.8 at 90%cl .",
    "a time dependent angular analysis of flavour tagged events will be performed to extract the cp asymmetry resulting in a statistical sensitivity @xmath44 .",
    "precision measurements of the @xmath5 angle can be performed using several channels and different methods , a summary of the estimated sensitivities is presented in table [ table_gamma ] @xcite .",
    "in addition to @xmath45 and @xmath26 channels , already studied at the b - factories , lhcb will also use @xmath7 ones .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table_d * ]    this huge sample of charm decays will allow to perform several studies on mixing and cp violation  @xcite .",
    "only few examples will be mentioned here . in 2 @xmath17 of data , using `` wrong - sign '' @xmath46 decays it is expected to obtain a statistical precision on the mixing parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 . through the ratio of mean lifetime of @xmath49 to the mean lifetime of the cp - even decay @xmath50 the mixing parameter @xmath51 can be measured with a sensitivity @xmath52 . with tagged and untagged",
    "@xmath50 decays , the direct cp violation in the lifetime asymmetry can be measured with a sensitivity @xmath53 .",
    "results obtained by lhcb in the first years of the experiment , with about 10 @xmath17 , will allow to probe the presence of new physics in cp violation and rare decays .",
    "however the evidence of small effects and the discrimination among different models will require improved precision , and several measurements will still be limited by statistical precision .",
    "higher luminosity is needed for a real step forward and the lhcb collaboration is investigating the upgrade of the detector to handle a luminosity around @xmath54 @xmath55 and to integrate up to about 100 @xmath17 .",
    "this upgrade does not require a machine upgrade , since this luminosity will be already available in the standard lhc program , however it may overlap in time with it and with atlas and cms upgrades .",
    "the main issues are related to the increase of the number of interactions per bunch crossing , therefore to the higher detector occupancy , the higher radiation dose , the need of fast vertex detection in order to increase the trigger efficiency for hadronic modes .",
    "technical solutions are under study and an expression of interest for an lhcb upgrade has been submitted to lhcc @xcite . concerning some of the key measurements discussed in the previous sections , the goal is to reach a sensitivity in cp violation measurements in the @xmath7 mixing at few per - mille level in @xmath8 and at the per - cent level in @xmath43 , a precision of about 1 degree on the measurement of @xmath5 and to test the chiral structure of the photon emitted in @xmath56 decays at the percent level .",
