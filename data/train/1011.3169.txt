    "existence of positive solutions for @xmath15-laplacian problems depending on the gradient has been attracting considerable interest among researchers of elliptic pde s , but no general method to deal with this kind of problem has been established . the dependence on the gradient requests a priori bounds on the solutions and in their derivatives , what brings additional difficulties . in general , this problem is not suitable for variational techniques and thus topological methods ( as fixed - point or degree results ) and/or blow - up arguments are normally employed to solve it ( @xcite ) .    in the case of the laplacian ( i.e. , @xmath17 )",
