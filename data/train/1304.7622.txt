    "the overall planning tasks to be performed in water distribution networks consists of three kinds of problems : layout , design and operation .",
    "although these problems are not independent with each other , they can be formulated and solved separately from a technical point of view since each one can be considered as a parameter when others are being solved . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the optimal design problem .",
    "+ optimal selection of pipe diameters to constitute a water distribution network respecting certain pressure requirements has been shown to be an np - hard problem @xcite , mainly due to two reasons : nonlinear equations and discrete - valued diameters . a terribly clumsy method for designing pipe network is by enumeration or complete trial and error @xcite .",
    "traditional methods are to linearize and relax the problem firstly to facilitate the use of linear programming and nonlinear programming , and then they have to round off the solution to the nearest discrete diameters @xcite . such algorithms can not guarantee global optima and sometimes cause infeasible solutions . in the last few decades ,",
    "intelligent optimization techniques including : genetic algorithm @xcite , simulated annealing @xcite , shuffled complex evolution @xcite , ant colony optimization @xcite , harmony search @xcite , particle swarm optimization @xcite , differential evolution @xcite and some of their hybrids @xcite , have found wide applications in this field .",
    "the advantages of using these stochastic algorithms are : ( 1 ) simple representation of a discrete - valued solution ; ( 2 ) independent to the problem structure to some extent ; ( 3 ) easy computation due to the only use of the information about the objective function ; ( 4 ) high probability to gain the global optimum or approximate global optimum in a reasonable amount of time .",
    "+ we introduce the recently developed intelligent optimization algorithm , state transition algorithm ( sta ) @xcite , which shows fantastic performance in continuous function optimization . in @xcite ,",
    "a discrete sta was proposed to solve the traveling salesman problem , and the results demonstrated that it consumed much less time and had better search ability than the well - known simulated annealing and ant colony optimization .",
    "the goal of this paper is to apply the discrete sta to the optimal design problem of the water distribution networks .",

    "conclusion is derived in section vi .",
    "for a given layout of pipes and a set of specified demand patterns at the nodes , the optimal design of a water distribution network is to find the combination of commercial pipe sizes which gives the minimum cost , subject to the following constraints :    * continuity of flow ; * head loss ; * conservation of energy ; * minimum pressure head .",
    "considering that the pipe layout , connectivity and imposed minimum head constraints are known , in the optimal design problem of the water distribution network , the pipe diameters are the only decision variables . as a result",
    ", the objective function is assured to be a cost function of pipe diameters @xmath2 where , @xmath3 is a set of commercial pipe sizes , @xmath4 is the number of pipes , and @xmath5 is the length of pipe _ j _ , which is known in this study .",
    "@xmath6 indicates that for every commercial pipe size , there is a corresponding cost per unit associated with it .",
    "conservation of mass at nodes or junctions in a water distribution network yields a set of linear algebraic equations in terms of flows . at each node",
    ", flow continuity should be satisfied , @xmath7 where , @xmath8 is the demand at the node , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the flow entering and leaving the node , respectively .      the head loss in a pipe in the water distribution network can be computed from a number of empirically obtained equations .",
    "the two commonly used equations are the darcy - weisbach head loss equation and the hazen - williams head loss equation . the general expression for the head loss in a pipe _ j _ located between nodes _ i _ and _ k _ is given by @xmath11 where ,",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are nodal pressure head at the end of the pipe at node _ i _ and _ k _ respectively ; @xmath14 is called resistance factor for the pipe _ j _ ; @xmath15 is the flow in pipe _ j _ ; @xmath16 is a numerical conversion constant depending on the units used ; @xmath5 is the length of pipe _ j _ ; @xmath17 is the roughness coefficient ; @xmath18 and @xmath19 are coefficients .",
    "+ for international system of units ( si ) , @xmath20 or @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are employed in this study using the hazen - williams formula .",
    "energy conservation equations around closed simple loops or between fixed head nodes along required independent paths in a network are nonlinear . upon traversing a closed simple loop or a required independent path , the sum of pipe head losses around the loop or the path must be zero , which can be expressed as @xmath24 where ,",
    "@xmath25 is the indices of pipes in a closed simple loop or a required independent path ; @xmath26 is the hydraulic grade line at the reservoir _",
    "j_.      the minimum pressure head constraints at each node are given as follows @xmath27 where , @xmath28 is known , and @xmath29 is the number of nodes .",
    "let s consider the following unconstrained integer optimization problem @xmath30 where , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is a real - valued function .",
    "if a solution to a specific optimization problem is described as a state , then the transformation to update the solution becomes a state transition . without loss of generality ,",
    "the unified form of discrete state transition algorithm can be described as @xmath35 where , @xmath36 stands for a current state , corresponding to a solution of a discrete optimization problem ; @xmath37 is a function of @xmath38 and historical states ; @xmath39 , @xmath40 are transformation operators , which are usually state transition matrixes ; @xmath41 is a operation , which is admissible to operate on two states ; @xmath42 is the cost function or evaluation function . + as a intelligent optimization algorithm , the discrete state transition algorithm have the following five key elements : + ( 1 ) representation of a solution . in discrete sta",
    ", we choose special representations , that is , the permutation of the set @xmath43 , which can be easily manipulated by some intelligent operators .",
    "the reason that we call the operators  intelligent \" is due to their geometrical property ( swap , shift , symmetry and substitute ) , and a intelligent operator has the same geometrical function for different representations .",
    "a big advantage of such representations and operators is that , after each state transformation , the newly created state is always feasible , avoiding the trouble into rounding off a continuous solution in other cases .",
    "+ ( 2 ) sampling in a candidate set .",
    "when a transformation operator is exerted on a current state , the next state is not deterministic , that is to say , there are possibly different choices for the next state .",
    "it is not difficult to imagine that all possible choices will constitute a candidate set , or a  neighborhood \" .",
    "then we execute several times of transformation ( called search enforcement @xmath44 ) on current state , to sampling in the  neighborhood \" .",
    "sampling is a very important factor in state transition algorithm , which can reduce the search space and avoid enumeration .",
    "+ ( 3 ) local exploitation and global exploration . in optimization algorithms",
    ", it is quite significant to design good local and global operators .",
    "the local exploitation can guarantee high precision of a solution and convergent performance of a algorithm , and the global exploration can avoid getting trapped into local minima or prevent premature convergence . in discrete optimization",
    ", it is extremely difficult to define a  good \" local optimal solution due to its dependence on a problem s structure , which leads to the same difficulty in the definition of local exploitation and global exploration .",
    "anyway , in the discrete state transition algorithm , we define the slow change to current solution by a transformation as local exploitation , while the big change to current solution by a transformation as global exploration .",
    "+ ( 4 ) self learning and regular communication .",
    "state transition algorithm behaves in two styles , one is individual - based , the other is population - based , which is certainly a extended version .",
    "the individual - based state transition algorithm focuses on self learning , in other words , with emphasis on the operators designing and dynamic adjustment ( details given in the following ) .",
    "undoubtedly , communication among different states is a promising strategy for state transition algorithm , as indicated in @xcite . through communication",
    ", states can share information and cooperate with each other .",
    "however , how to communicate and when to communicate are key issues . in continuous state transition algorithm , intermittent exchange strategy was proposed , which means that states communicate with each other at a certain frequency in a regular way .",
    "+ ( 5 ) dynamic adjustment .",
    "it is a potentially useful strategy for state transition algorithm . in the iteration process of an intelligent algorithm ,",
    "the fitness value can decrease sharply in the early stage , but it stagnates in the late stage , due to the static environment . as a result , some perturbation should be added to activate the environment .",
    "in fact , dynamic adjustment can be understood and implemented in various ways .",
    "for example , the alternative use of different local and global operators is dynamic adjustment to some extent .",
    "then , we can change the search enforcement , vary the cost function , reduce the dimension , etc .",
    "of course ,  risk a bad solution in probability \" is another dynamic adjustment , which is widely used in simulated annealing ( sa ) . in sa ,",
    "the metropolis criterion @xcite is used to accept a bad solution : @xmath45 where , @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the boltzmann probability factor , @xmath48 is the temperature to regulate the process of annealing . in the early stage",
    ", temperature is high , and it has big probability to accept a bad solution , while in the late stage , temperature is low , and it has very small probability to accept a bad solution , which is the key point to guarantee the convergence .",
    "we can see that the metropolis criterion has the ability to escape from local optimality , but on the other hand , it will miss some  good solutions \" as well .",
    "+ in this study , we focus on the individual - based sta , and the main process of discrete sta is shown in the pseudocode as follows     + as for detailed explanations , swap function in above pseudocode is given as follows for example    from the pseudocodes , we can find that in discrete sta , in the whole , ",

    "the  risk a bad solution in probability \" strategy aims to escape from local optimal , while the  greedy criterion \" and  restore the incumbent best solution in probability \" are to guarantee a good convergence .      in discrete sta , we use the index of the a commercial size as a representation for a solution to the optimal design problem .",
    "for example , if there are 8 pipes and for each pipe there are 3 choices , then the details of four special geometric operators are defined as follows + ( 1 ) swap transformation @xmath51 where , @xmath52 is called swap permutation matrix , @xmath53 is a constant integer called swap factor to control the maximum number of positions to be exchanged , while the positions are random . if @xmath54 , we call the swap operator local exploitation , and if @xmath55 , the swap operator is regarded as global exploration . fig .",

    "it was proved that the above general random search methods can converge in probability to an optimal solution , and it was also demonstrated that , to guarantee the convergence of an optimization algorithm , the criterion to accept a new solution is a key point @xcite .",
    "the  greedy criterion \" ( always accept a better new solution ) is sufficient to guarantee the convergence ; nevertheless , accepting a relative worse solution as suggested in simulated annealing can also achieve asymptotic convergence @xcite .",
    "in particular , random search methods differ in the choice of the neighborhood structure @xmath81 , and they influence the rate of convergence .",
    "the sequence generated by discrete sta can converge to a global minimizer in probability .    on the one hand ,",
    "the discrete sta is a special case of the random search methods , since the  greedy criterion \" is used as an external archive to keep the incumbent best solution , which can guarantee convergence of the proposed algorithms .    on the other hand",
