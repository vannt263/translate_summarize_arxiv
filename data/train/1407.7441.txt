    "of the 241 split gates measured , @xmath151 showed conductance anomalies at this value ; it is therefore unusual to find features at @xmath9 in 1d devices on gaas / algaas heterostructures for @xmath152 t ( the magnetic field at which these measurements were performed ) .",
    "these data were not included in the analysis because of evidence of disorder ; for example , in fig .",

    "the co - existence of disorder effects may be responsible for the lowering of the conductance of the 0.7 structure to @xmath9 .",
    "a statistical measurement makes it possible to distinguish the `` normal '' characteristics from device - specific effects , which may be related to disorder .",
    "devices which display unusual conductance anomaly can be investigated for rare physical phenomena , while very clean devices can be used to identify standard behavior .",
    "the reproducibility of conductance characteristics has been investigated by thermally cycling the sample .",
    "it was found that many of the split gates which showed evidence of disorder did so on both cooldowns  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the current article is to compare properties of 1d conductance from a large number of devices on a single cooldown .",
    "the reproducibility of these properties on thermal cycling warrants a further , separate study .",
    "the sample was also illuminated with a light - emitting diode ( led ) , which increased @xmath11 and @xmath12 to @xmath153 @xmath14 and @xmath154 @xmath16v@xmath17s@xmath17 , respectively .",
    "this resulted in longer , better - defined plateaus in conductance , since the 1d confining potential becomes stronger and the 1d subband spacing increases .",
    "however , many devices showed occasional structure in conductance which had the appearance of resonant transmission through the quantum wire , consistent with an enhancement of resonant effects due to sharper confinement  @xcite",
    ". we did not investigate @xmath4 or @xmath145 in this case since the estimates are very likely to be affected by the resonances .",
    "across an array of nominally identical split gates ( measured at a single @xmath7 ) , significant fluctuations were seen to exist in the 1d potential .",
    "these have been quantified by estimating the curvature of barrier in the transport direction ( @xmath155 ) for each device .",
    "large variations were observed in both the appearance of the 0.7 structure and the value at which it occurred .",
    "the 0.7 structure appears to be extremely sensitive to the specific 1d potential in each device .",
    "measuring many devices has enabled a statistical study to be performed .",
    "no correlations were apparent between @xmath4 and @xmath155 , or other properties of the 1d conductance trace .",
    "a specific set of physical conditions combine to give a particular conductance trace for a split gate . with the current analysis",
    ", the effect of individual factors influencing the conductance properties can not be separated .",
    "thus , parameters which may govern @xmath4 and @xmath145 have not been identified .",
    "this may become possible by performing dc bias spectroscopy for each device in order to accurately measure 1d subband spacing and lever arm @xmath89 , thereby giving a better estimate of @xmath145 .",
    "the confining potential will be affected by fluctuations in the background potential due to the ionized dopants ( leading to local density variations ) and the existence of impurities ( giving rise to disorder effects ) .",
    "we removed data which showed evidence of disorder from the analysis , although a fuller study requires @xmath8- and @xmath7-dependent measurements ( since disorder effects will be masked at the temperature at which the measurements were performed ) .",
    "we have shown that disorder does give rise to conductance anomaly at unexpected values , e.g. , close to @xmath9 .",
    "disorder effects can be reduced by fabricating samples on a wafer with higher electron mobility , or using an undoped heterostructure and electrostatically inducing the 2deg  @xcite .",
