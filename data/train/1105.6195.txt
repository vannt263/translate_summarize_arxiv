    "a ricci soliton consists of a complete riemannian metric @xmath0 and a complete vector field @xmath1 on a manifold which satisfy the equation : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a real constant and @xmath4 denotes the lie derivative .",
    "the soliton is called _ steady _ if @xmath5 , _ expanding _ if @xmath6 and _ shrinking _ if @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath1 is a killing vector field , the metric is actually einstein , and the soliton is called _ trivial _ : we shall exclude these in what follows .",
    "for general background , see @xcite and @xcite .    as well as being natural generalisations of einstein metrics , ricci solitons are of interest as generating particularly simple solutions to the ricci flow , for",
    "they evolve under this flow just by its natural symmetries , that is , by diffeomorphisms and homothetic rescalings .",
    "ricci solitons are of crucial importance in analysing , via dilations , singularities of the flow @xcite .",
    "the ricci flow is also of physical interest as an approximation to the renormalisation group flow for nonlinear sigma - models @xcite .",
    "indeed one of the earliest nontrivial ricci solitons , the hamilton cigar @xcite , was also discovered in a physical context by witten @xcite .",
    "most known examples of ricci solitons are of _ gradient type _ , that is , we have @xmath8 for a smooth function @xmath9 .",
    "equation ( [ liers ] ) then becomes @xmath10 we shall use the abbreviation grs for gradient ricci solitons . in this case",
    ", the completeness of @xmath11 actually follows from the completeness of @xmath0 , by the recent work of z. zhang @xcite .",
    "noncompact complete solitons may be steady , expanding or shrinking , but nontrivial compact solitons must be shrinking and of gradient type @xcite . in all cases",
    "khler examples have been constructed ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for example , among many other authors ) . in the expanding and steady cases non - khler examples were constructed in @xcite , @xcite , generalising examples of bryant @xcite , ivey @xcite , gastel and kronz @xcite .",
    "there are also many homogeneous non - khler expanders ( necessarily of non - gradient type ) , constructed by lauret @xcite and others .",
    "in contrast , so far the only known complete nontrivial shrinking solitons are khler , or else are rigid ( i.e. obtained from a product of einstein spaces and a gaussian soliton @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we begin a study of shrinking solitons which are not necessarily of khler type .",
    "we shall focus on solitons of cohomogeneity one , when the existence of a symmetry group with hypersurface principal orbits ( or a suitable bundle ansatz ) reduces the equations to a system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "this is a natural place to start , as homogeneous compact solitons are trivial .",
    "moreover , the great majority of known complete nontrivial solitons are either homogeneous ( in the case of lauret s noncompact expanders ) or obtained by a cohomogeneity one / bundle - type construction .",
    "( the main exceptions we are aware of are the existence result @xcite for khler - ricci solitons on toric varieties , and the generalisation @xcite to fano toric bundles over a generalised flag variety ) .    in  1,2",
    "we show that the general cohomogeneity one shrinking soliton equations yield a winding number , representing the winding of the flow around the subvariety of phase space corresponding to einstein solutions .",
    "we obtain some estimates for the winding .",
    "we also introduce a functional which is monotone in a certain region of phase space . in ",
    "3 we prove a nonexistence result for compact cohomogeneity one solitons with certain orbit types , analogous to a result of bhm in the einstein case @xcite . in ",
    "4 we focus on solitons of multiple warped product type . in  5 we report on numerical investigations for some orbit types , including those where solutions were found in the einstein case @xcite .",
    "the numerics indicate that the shrinking soliton equations on compact spaces exhibit a high degree of rigidity ; in particular we discuss several spaces where einstein metrics exist @xcite but where numerical searches did not produce any evidence of nontrivial solitons .",

    "he would like to thank his phd supervisor , prof .",

    "the third author is partially supported by nserc grant no .",
    "let us consider a cohomogeneity one gradient ricci soliton : this means that the soliton is invariant under the action of a lie group @xmath12 with generic orbit ( called the principal orbit type ) of real codimension one .",
    "we write the principal orbit as @xmath13 , where @xmath12 is a compact lie group and @xmath14 is a closed subgroup .",
    "we refer to @xcite for background on the soliton equations in the cohomogeneity one setting .",
    "we denote by @xmath15 the dimension of @xmath13 , so the cohomogeneity one manifold @xmath16 has dimension @xmath17 .",
    "the open and dense subset @xmath18 of the manifold consisting of the principal orbits may be written as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is an open interval in @xmath21 and the product structure results from choosing a geodesic which intersects all generic orbits orthogonally .",
    "on @xmath18 we may then write the soliton potential as @xmath22 and the metric as @xmath23 where , for each @xmath24 , @xmath25 is a @xmath12-invariant metric on @xmath13 . letting @xmath26",
    "be an ad@xmath27-invariant complement to @xmath28 in @xmath29 , we know that @xmath12-invariant metrics on @xmath13 correspond to ad@xmath27-invariant inner products on @xmath26 .",
    "the cohomogeneity one gradient ricci soliton equations on @xmath19 are now @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the shape operator of the hypersurface orbits , viewed as an endomorphism and related to the metric by @xmath32 .",
    "also @xmath33 denotes the ricci endomorphism , and @xmath34 is the codifferential for @xmath35-valued @xmath36-forms .",
    "note that the first equation represents the components of the equations tangent to @xmath13 , the second is the equation in the normal direction , and the last equation represents the mixed directions .",
    "the cohomogeneity one manifold can have up to two special orbits , corresponding to the endpoints of the interval @xmath20 . in this paper",
    "we will assume that there is at least one special orbit , placed at @xmath37 .",
    "we may then assume that @xmath38 where @xmath39 is an extended positive real number .",
    "if @xmath40 , @xmath16 is compact and additional conditions must be imposed at @xmath41 and @xmath39 to ensure that the metric @xmath42 and potential @xmath9 extend smoothly to all of @xmath16 . when there is only one special orbit , the cohomogeneity one manifold is non - compact , and there are further conditions which ensure that @xmath42 is complete .",
    "( see @xcite and @xcite for more details of the smoothness conditions . )",
    "here we just like to highlight one result from @xcite ( cf prop 3.19 ) which has practical consequences for the construction of gradient ricci solitons .",
    "assume that there is a special orbit of dimension strictly smaller than @xmath15",
    ". then if ( [ soleqs ] ) holds for a sufficiently smooth ( @xmath43 ) metric and potential , then ( [ soleq - mixed ] ) automatically holds .",
    "furthermore , if the well - known _ conservation law _",
    "@xmath44 holds for some fixed constant @xmath45 , then ( [ soleqn ] ) also holds . in other words , in constructing cohomogeneity one gradient ricci solitons , it is enough to produce a solution to ( [ soleqs ] ) satisfying the conservation law which is smooth up to order @xmath46 .",
    "note that in @xcite examples of principal orbit and special orbits are given for which the smoothness conditions for @xmath42 have to be checked to arbitrarily high orders .    using ( [ soleqn ] ) and the trace of ( [ soleqs ] ) , the conservation law above can be written in the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the scalar curvature of the principal orbits and the constant @xmath45 is the same one as in ( [ cons1 ] ) .",
    "we note that this form of the conservation law may be viewed as the zero energy condition for a hamiltonian constructed out of perelman s energy and entropy functionals .",
    "two quantities appearing in ( [ ham ] ) are of interest to us .",
    "the first is @xmath49 which is the analogue of the mean curvature @xmath50 of the principal orbits for the dilaton volume element @xmath51 . by ( [ soleqn ] )",
    ", @xmath52 is strictly decreasing in the shrinking case ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "indeed we have the useful inequality @xmath53 furthermore , when there is a special orbit with codimension @xmath54 placed at @xmath37 , the smoothness conditions imply that @xmath55 and @xmath56 as @xmath57 . in the complete , noncompact case ,",
    "the two facts above show that @xmath52 tends to @xmath58 as @xmath24 tends to @xmath41 and @xmath52 tends to @xmath59 as @xmath24 tends to @xmath58 . in the compact case , an analogous calculation to that above",
    "shows that @xmath52 tends to @xmath59 as we approach the second special orbit at @xmath60 .",
    "hence in the shrinking case , if the metric is complete , @xmath52 must decrease from @xmath58 to @xmath59 regardless of whether @xmath16 is compact or non - compact .",
    "denote by @xmath61 the unique zero of @xmath52 , and introduce , as in @xcite , @xcite , the variable @xmath62 as well as a new independent variable @xmath63 defined by @xmath64 we shall use a prime @xmath65 to denote differentiation with respect to @xmath63 .",
    "it is natural to let @xmath66 correspond to @xmath37 .",
    "the zero @xmath61 of @xmath52 corresponds to the blow - up time of @xmath67 , which occurs at a _",
    "value @xmath68 of @xmath63 . to see this , note that equation ( [ soleqn ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath69 or in terms of @xmath67 as @xmath70 since @xmath7 , we have @xmath71 , which shows that @xmath67 blows up in finite time",
    ".    we shall call a point where @xmath67 blows up ( or equivalently , where the generalised mean curvature @xmath52 vanishes ) , a _",
    "turning point_. for the special case of einstein trajectories , where @xmath9 is constant , this reduces to bhm s notion of turning point , that is , a point where the hypersurface becomes minimal @xcite .",
    "note however that a turning point is not a singularity of the metric , just a coordinate singularity . one might hope to construct compact shrinkers by glueing together two trajectories at the turning point if the right matching conditions held .",
    "the second interesting quantity is @xmath72 which we view both as a smooth function on @xmath16 and on the interval ( orbit space ) @xmath20 .",
    "since one may add an arbitrary constant to the soliton potential , ( [ cons1 ] ) shows that this is compensated by a corresponding change in the constant @xmath45 appearing in the conservation law .",
    "this is one of the reasons for interest in the quantity @xmath73 rather than the potential .",
    "it is then natural to introduce also @xmath74 , as @xmath9 is defined up to an arbitrary constant .",
    "note that ( [ cons1 ] ) may now be written as @xmath75    we now switch to derivatives with respect to @xmath63 .",
    "we have @xmath76 differentiating @xmath77 we obtain @xmath78 where we used ( [ cons1 ] ) to get the second equality above . in other words , we have the associated system @xmath79 along the solution trajectories as long as the independent variable @xmath63 makes sense .",
    "note that the eigenvalues of the matrix are @xmath80",
    "so in the shrinking case ( @xmath7 ) they form a complex conjugate pair with negative real part , provided @xmath81 .",
    "we will now examine the system ( [ ef ] ) more closely .    the origin in the @xmath82-plane ( which is invariant under the flow ) represents trajectories with constant soliton potential @xmath9 , that is , einstein trajectories .",
    "in the expanding case @xmath3 is positive , and hence the quadrants @xmath83 and @xmath84 are invariant under the flow ( cf @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "this fact was used to establish bounds on the flow for the case of expanding solitons of multiple warped product type .    in the shrinking case",
    "this is no longer the case .",
    "indeed , @xmath85 has the opposite sign to @xmath86 , while @xmath87 takes the same sign as @xmath73 on @xmath88 .",
    "the phase plane diagram shows that no quadrant is invariant and indeed the flow exhibits rotational behaviour around the origin in the @xmath82-plane .    in order to analyse the behaviour of the variables @xmath73 and @xmath86 in the shrinking case , it is convenient to take @xmath89 .",
    "we observe , from the equations ( [ ef ] ) , that @xmath90 so @xmath91 is monotonic decreasing .",
    "( note that for a non - trivial soliton , @xmath92 can not be @xmath41 along the flow . )",
    "we also calculate @xmath93 if we let @xmath94 , this equation becomes @xmath95    we are interested in estimating the winding angle around the origin of the flow in the @xmath82-plane up to the ( unique ) turning point @xmath68 ( point where @xmath67 blows up , cf the above discussion ) .",
    "let us take the @xmath86-axis as horizontal and the @xmath73-axis as vertical .",
    "we shall consider trajectories emanating from a point on the positive @xmath73-axis ( i.e. , @xmath96 ) since at a special orbit we need @xmath97 , that is , @xmath88 .",
    "our phase - plane diagram shows that the flow will initially move into the quadrant with @xmath84 and can never re - cross the positive @xmath73-axis from the right .",
    "the winding angle is therefore nonpositive .",
    "analogous statements hold for trajectories emanating from a point on the negative @xmath73-axis , where @xmath98 .",
    "observe further that the line @xmath99 is a reflecting barrier for the flow unless @xmath100 .",
    "also note that once @xmath67 exceeds @xmath101 then @xmath102 is monotonic decreasing , i.e. , the flow winds clockwise around the origin .",
    "the winding angle is @xmath103 where we have arranged for @xmath66 to correspond to @xmath37 ( in view of ( [ st ] ) and the initial conditions ) .",
    "the value of the first integral is between zero and @xmath104 , from our above remarks , as until @xmath67 reaches @xmath101 the flow is trapped between @xmath96 and @xmath99 .",
    "for the second integral , we can change variables to rewrite it ( using ( [ weqn ] ) with @xmath105 and ( [ theta ] ) ) as @xmath106    these integrals are bounded in absolute value by @xmath107 and @xmath108 respectively , just using the nonegativity of @xmath109 .",
    "we have therefore deduced    [ windingbound ] for trajectories of the associated flow in the @xmath110-plane starting from either the positive @xmath111 or negative @xmath73 axis , the winding angle around the origin up to the turning point is finite , nonpositive , and bounded below by @xmath112 .    of course one would like solutions with winding angle @xmath113 , so as to get @xmath88 at the turning point @xmath68 , which is one of the conditions needed to get a symmetric solution .",
    "the above argument shows that one can not achieve this by mimicking the bhm techniques  we can not make the winding angle arbitrarily large by varying some parameter .",
    "[ hq ] we can relate @xmath114 to the quantities used in the paper on expanding solitons @xcite as follows . let us define @xmath115 we recall from @xcite the calculation : @xmath116 which is actually valid for general orbit types .",
    "it follows that @xmath117    we can then derive easily the equations : @xmath118 @xmath119 which we saw in @xcite in the special case where @xmath3 was positive and the cohomogeneity one metric was a warped product on @xmath120 factors .",
    "the associated system ( [ ef ] ) described earlier may be regarded as a renormalised version of the above pair of equations where we replace @xmath121 and @xmath122 by their quotients by appropriate powers of the variable @xmath67 .",
    "note that the subset @xmath123 is invariant under the flow of the grs equations ( at least while the variable @xmath63 is defined ) , and consists of einstein trajectories .",
    "in this section we describe some properties of complete shrinking gradient ricci solitons with cohomogeneity one .",
    "it is known that the scalar curvature of a complete steady or shrinking gradient ricci soliton must be non - negative . in the compact case ,",
    "steady grs are in fact ricci flat and shrinking grs must have positive scalar curvature ( cf proposition 1.13 of @xcite ) . for the non - compact case",
    ", the non - negativity follows from a theorem of b. l. chen ( corollary 2.5 of @xcite ) on complete ancient solutions of the ricci flow .",
    "( the result was previously known assuming sectional curvature bounds . )    for cohomogeneity one gradient ricci solitons , the ambient scalar curvature @xmath124 is given by @xmath125 where @xmath48 denotes the scalar curvature of the principal orbits ( cf  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "now we have @xmath126 where we used ( [ soleqs ] ) and ( [ ham ] ) respectively in the first two equalities .",
    "now @xmath127 immediately leads to the upper bound @xmath128 which is strict in the compact shrinking case .",
    "we take this opportunity to emphasize that @xmath129 can be viewed both as a function on @xmath16 and a function on @xmath20 , and we will frequently switch from one viewpoint to the other in the following .",
    "[ steadyc ] for the steady case , the above inequality becomes @xmath130 with equality iff @xmath131 is identically zero , i.e. , the soliton is trivial .",
    "[ expanderc ] in the case of a complete non - trivial expanding grs of cohomogeneity one , corollary 2.3 of @xcite , applied to the ricci flow generated by the expander , implies that @xmath132 ( note that our ambient manifold has dimension @xmath17 . ) since @xmath3 is now positive , the trace of ( [ gradrs ] ) yields @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the negative laplacian of the cohomogeneity one metric .",
    "as @xmath73 is a function of @xmath24 only , @xmath135 . using the above facts in ( [ eqne ] ) we obtain @xmath136 . in particular , if we assume without loss of generality that @xmath137 , then the constant @xmath45 in the conservation law must be negative .",
    "going back to the shrinking case , recall that the smoothness conditions at a special orbit placed at @xmath37 imply that @xmath138 and @xmath139 for sufficiently small values of @xmath24 .",
    "( here the mean curvature @xmath50 of the principal orbits is taken with respect to the  outward \" normal @xmath140 . )",
    "hence , in the case of a complete shrinking grs of cohomogeneity one , the conservation law ( [ cons1 ] ) and ( [ ebound ] ) give @xmath141 so for the initial value @xmath142 we have the upper bound @xmath143 which must be strict at both endpoints in the case of compact shrinkers .",
    "this means that the trajectories of the associated flow in the @xmath82-plane can not start arbitrarily high on the positive @xmath73-axis if they correspond to complete solutions , compact or not .",
    "by contrast , note that there is no such restriction on @xmath142 from the initial value problem ( cf @xcite ) around special orbits .    note also that the upper bound @xmath144 is attained by the conical gaussian soliton on @xmath145 .",
    "indeed , in this case @xmath146 ( see remark [ cg ] ) .",

    "we note first that by ( [ eqne ] ) @xmath129 can be viewed as a solution to the _ linear _ equation @xmath157 on @xmath153 the coefficient @xmath52 is finite - valued and at least @xmath158 .",
    "since the soliton is non - trivial , @xmath129 can not vanish at an interior critical point @xmath159 .",

    "the parameters searched are @xmath440 , @xmath441 and the stepsize is @xmath442 .",
    "the cluster about @xmath443 corresponds to the koiso - cao soliton , the cluster about @xmath444 is the page metric , and the third cluster is the koiso - cao soliton with the conjugate complex structure .",
    "we investigated for the soliton the behaviour of the winding angle of  1 numerically , and found that the angle decreases monotonically along the flow .      here @xmath446 and",
    "the principal orbits are @xmath447 . as we have mentioned before , bhm @xcite found infinitely many cohomogeneity one einstein metrics on this manifold .",
    "we choose the normalisation @xmath448 so that the standard round metric has initial conditions @xmath449    we need one of the @xmath450 factors to collapse at one end , and the other factor to collapse at the other end .",
    "we are looking for a @xmath433 such that @xmath451 for some @xmath452 and some @xmath453 .",
    "we output initial conditions where @xmath454 satisfies @xmath438 for some @xmath439 .",
    "the only values the program plotted are on the ` einstein axis ' , @xmath455 .",
    "we can see a cluster of points around @xmath456 which correspond to the standard metric , a cluster around 2.5 which is the first bhm metric ( @xmath457 ) , then a final large cluster around 0 ( of course there should be infinitely many clusters between 2.5 and 0 but obviously our numerics can not detect all these ) .",
    "the authors are yet to find a cluster away from the einstein axis .",
    "it is interesting to restrict the algorithm to @xmath458 and output the value of sol closest to @xmath41 for each @xmath422 .",
    "this plot gives us        we can clearly pick out the first three values of @xmath422 corresponding to the bhm metrics @xmath459 .",
    "we also see that the behaviour gets increasingly complicated as @xmath460 .      as in the @xmath445 case , the group acting on the manifold is @xmath462 and the principal orbits are @xmath463 .",
    "we now need the same @xmath450 factor to collapse at each end .",
    "we are looking for a @xmath433 such that @xmath464 for @xmath435 and some @xmath453 .",
    "as in the @xmath445 case , we do not find any non - trivial solitons .",
    "the hunting program does output clusters of points corresponding to the bhm - einstein metrics on this manifold .",
    "as it is more illuminating we output the smallest values of sol along some trajectories with @xmath458 .",
    "so we see we can pick out the standard product metric on this space @xmath465 and then the bhm metrics corresponding to the initial values @xmath466 and @xmath467 .    as mentioned earlier , the analytical methods used by bhm to construct einstein metrics only work in the dimension range @xmath468 .",
    "it is not clear , however , for which orbit types this restriction is essential .",
    "it is also conceivable that soliton solutions might exist on manifolds where einstein metrics do not .",
    "this is certainly the situation in the khler case .",
    "we therefore examine next an example in higher dimensions , namely @xmath469 .      in this example",
    "the group is @xmath470 and the principal orbits are @xmath471 .",
    "the only cluster found by this search is one around @xmath472 corresponding to the standard round metric on @xmath469 .",
    "another interesting case is that of the connected sum of two copies of quaternionic projective space with opposite orientations . in this case",
    "the groups are @xmath474 , @xmath475 and @xmath476 .",
    "the principal orbits are @xmath477 , and we have @xmath478 and @xmath479 .",
    "the special orbits are @xmath480 , and the constant @xmath481 .    in the case",
    "@xmath482 bhm @xcite was able to prove the existence of a cohomogeneity one einstein metric on @xmath483 he was also able to give numerical evidence for the existence of two cohomogeneity one einstein metrics in many cases where @xmath484 , although these examples are outside the dimension range where his analytical methods work ( some of these examples were also found numerically by page and pope @xcite ) .",
    "we also looked for solitons in these cases .",
    "we ran the hunting program for a variety of values of @xmath15 , using the initial values @xmath485 and @xmath486 . in order to increase accuracy",
    ", we used a step size of @xmath487 in the runge - kutta algorithm .",
    "we could not find any non - trivial solitons .",
    "when @xmath482 we found the bhm metric at @xmath488 .",
    "we include a plot of sol below for this case .",
    "it demonstrates a certain instability that all the einstein metrics found on these manifolds shared , namely that one needs to be close to the exact conditions in order to get the trajectories to come close to closing up .",
    "we also include the same plot when @xmath489 .",
    "notice we recover metrics that bhm found numerically with @xmath490 and @xmath491 .",
    "we also considered the space @xmath492 from @xcite . for this space @xmath493 and @xmath494 , so the principal orbit is @xmath495 , and the special orbits are @xmath480 .",
    "the fibration @xmath401 is the twistor fibration for @xmath480 , and we have @xmath496 and @xmath497 , as well as @xmath498 and @xmath499 .",
    "again we can recover einstein metrics that bhm and gibbons - page - pope @xcite found numerically , but we did not find any nontrivial solitons .",
    "we include below the results for @xmath482 where we can see there is evidence for an einstein metric at @xmath500 .",
    "finally we also considered the connected sum of two copies of the cayley plane with opposite orientations . now @xmath502 and @xmath503 , so the principal orbit is @xmath504 , and the special orbits are @xmath505 .",
    "we have @xmath506 and @xmath507 , with @xmath508 and @xmath509 .",
    "we ran the soliton hunting program but did not find any evidence of einstein metrics or solitons .",
    "we conclude by discussing the smooth non compact gaussian of example [ sg ] .",
    "we consider the case when the principal orbits are @xmath447 . with our normalisations that @xmath510 in equation ( [ conseqn ] ) and @xmath511 , the gaussian soliton is described by @xmath512 where @xmath513 is the usual einstein metric on @xmath514 with einstein constant 1 .",
    "the soliton potential function is then given by @xmath515 when we input the initial condition @xmath516 and @xmath517 and integrate we indeed recover the gaussian soliton for a short time .",
    "however , as the numerical errors accumulate along the trajectory the numerical solution deviates from the gaussian and very quickly becomes singular .",
    "initial conditions close to the gaussian also display this behaviour .",
    "this suggests instability of the soliton , so that it might be difficult to produce complete non - compact solutions close to the gaussian .",
    "it should be noted that there are some gap theorems for the gaussian soliton on euclidean space , due to o. munteanu - m .- t . wang @xcite and yokota @xcite .",
