    "creating a compact reliable source of terahertz ( thz ) radiation is one of the most formidable tasks of the contemporary applied physics.@xcite one of the latest trends in thz technology@xcite is to use carbon nanotubes  cylindrical molecules with nanometer diameter and micrometer length@xcite  as building blocks of novel high - frequency devices .",
    "there are several promising proposals of using carbon nanotubes for thz applications including a nanoklystron utilizing extremely efficient high - field electron emission from nanotubes,@xcite devices based on negative differential conductivity in large - diameter semiconducting nanotubes,@xcite high - frequency resonant - tunneling diodes@xcite and schottky diodes,@xcite as well as electric - field - controlled carbon nanotube superlattices ,  @xcite frequency multipliers ,  @xcite thz amplifiers ,  @xcite switches  @xcite and antennas .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we will formulate and discuss several novel schemes to utilize physical properties of single - wall carbon nanotubes ( swnts ) for generation and detection of thz radiation .",
    "in this section we propose a novel scheme for generating thz radiation from single - walled carbon nanotubes ( swnts ) .",
    "this scheme is based on the electric - field induced heating of electron gas resulting in the inversion of population of optically active states with the energy difference within the thz spectrum range .",
    "it is well - known that the elastic backscattering processes in metallic swnts are strongly suppressed ,  @xcite and in a high enough electric field charge carriers can be accelerated up to the energy allowing emission of optical / zone - boundary phonons . at this energy , corresponding to the frequency of about 40 thz , the major scattering mechanism switches on abruptly resulting in current saturation.@xcite in what follows we show that for certain types of carbon nanotubes the heating of electrons to the energies below the phonon - emission threshold results in the spontaneous thz emission with the peak frequency controlled by an applied voltage .",
    "the electron energy spectrum of metallic swnts @xmath0 linearly depends on the electron wave vector @xmath1 close to the fermi energy and has the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 m / s is the fermi velocity of graphene , which corresponds to the commonly used tight - binding matrix element @xmath4ev .",
    "@xcite here and in what follows the zero of energy is defined as the fermi energy position in the absence of an external field .",
    "when the voltage , @xmath5 , is applied between the swnt ends , the electron distribution is shifted in the way shown by the heavy lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] corresponding to the filled electron states .",
    "this shift results in inversion of population and , correspondingly , in optical transitions between filled states in the conduction band and empty states in the valence band .",
    "the spectrum of optical transitions is determined by the distribution function for hot carriers , which in turn depends on the applied voltage and scattering processes in the swnt .",
    "it is well - known that the major scattering mechanism in swnts is due to electron - phonon interaction.@xcite since the scattering processes erode the inversion of electron population , an optimal condition for observing the discussed optical transitions takes place when the length of the swnt @xmath6 , where the electron mean - free path for acoustic phonon scattering is @xmath7m.@xcite below we consider only such short swnts with ideal ohmic contacts@xcite and in the ballistic transport regime , when the energy acquired by the electron on the whole length of the tube , @xmath8 , does not exceed the value of @xmath9ev at which the fast emission of high - energy phonons begins.@xcite in this regime,@xcite the current in the nanotube is given by the bttiker - landauer formula , @xmath10 , and the distribution function for hot electrons is @xmath11 the distribution function for hot holes , @xmath12 , has the same form as @xmath13 .",
    "let us select a swnt with the crystal structure most suitable for observation of the discussed effect .",
    "first , the required nanotube should have metallic conductivity and , second , the optical transitions between the lowest conduction subband and the top valence subband should be allowed .",
    "the crystal structure of a swnt is described by two integers @xmath14 , which completely define their physical properties .",
    "@xcite the swnts with true metallic energy band structure , for which the energy gap is absent for any swnt radius , are the armchair @xmath15 swnts only.@xcite however , for armchair swnts the optical transitions between the first conduction and valence subbands are forbidden.@xcite so we propose to use for the observation of thz generation the so - called quasi - metallic @xmath14 swnts with @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is an non - zero integer .",
    "these nanotubes , which are gapless within the frame of a simple zone - folding model of the @xmath18-electron graphene spectrum,@xcite are in fact narrow - gap semiconductors due to curvature effects .",
    "their bandgap is given by  @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the nearest - neighbor distance between two carbon atoms , @xmath21 is the nanotube radius , and @xmath22 $ ] is the chiral angle .",
    "@xcite it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eg ] ) that the gap is decreasing rapidly with increasing the nanotube radius . for large values of @xmath21 this gap can be neglected even in the case of moderate applied voltages due to zener tunneling of electrons across the gap .",
    "it is easy to show in the fashion similar to the original zener s work@xcite that the tunneling probability in quasi - metallic swnts is given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a numerical factor close to unity.@xcite for example , for a zigzag @xmath25 swnt the gap is @xmath26 mev and the zener breakdown takes place for the electric field @xmath27 v/@xmath28 m , which corresponds to a typical voltage of 0.1 v between the nanotube ends . in what follows",
    "all our calculations are performed for a zigzag @xmath29 swnt of large enough radius @xmath21 and for applied voltages exceeding the zener breakdown , so that the finite - gap effects can be neglected .",
    "the obtained results can be easily generalized for any quasi - metallic large - radius swnt .",
    "optical transitions in swnts have been a subject of extensive research ( see , e.g. , refs .  ;",
    "comprehensive reviews of the earlier work can be found in refs .  ) .",
    "we treat these transitions using the results of the nearest - neighbor orthogonal @xmath18-electron tight binding model .",
    "@xcite despite its apparent simplicity and well - known limitations , this model has been extremely successful in describing low - energy optical spectra and electronic properties of single - walled swnts ( see , e.g. , ref .   for one of the most recent manifestations of this model success ) .",
    "our goal is to calculate the spectral density of spontaneous emission , @xmath30 , which is the probability of optical transitions per unit time for the photon frequencies in the interval @xmath31 divided by @xmath32 . in the dipole approximation@xcite",
    "this spectral density is given by @xmath33 equation  ( [ wem ] ) contains the matrix element of the electron velocity operator . in the frame of the tight binding model ,",
    "this matrix element for optical transitions between the lowest conduction and the highest valence subbands of the @xmath29 zigzag swnt can be written as ( cf .",
    "@xmath34 where @xmath35 is the energy difference between the initial @xmath36 and the final @xmath37 states .",
    "these transitions are associated with the light polarized along the nanotube axis @xmath38 , in agreement with the general selection rules for swnts.@xcite substituting eq .",
    "( [ dipole ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ wem ] ) and performing necessary summation , we get @xmath39 equation ( [ wfinal ] ) has broader applicability limits than the considered case of @xmath6 and @xmath40 , in which the distribution functions for electrons and holes are given by eq .",
    "( [ fe ] ) . in the general case",
    "there is a strong dependence of @xmath41 on the distribution functions , which have to be calculated taking into account all the relevant scattering mechanisms.@xcite in the discussed ballistic regime the spectral density has a universal dependence on the applied voltage and photon frequency for all quasi - metallic swnts . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the spectral density is shown for two values of the voltage .",
    "it is clearly seen that the maximum of the spectral density of emission has strong voltage dependence and lies in the thz frequency range for experimentally attainable voltages .",
    "v ; dashed line for @xmath42v .",
    "the inset shows the directional radiation pattern of the thz emission with respect to the nanotube axis.,width=302 ]    the directional radiation pattern , shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , reflects the fact that the emission of light polarized normally to the nanotube axis is forbidden by the selection rules for the optical transitions between the lowest conduction subband and the top valence subband .    for some device applications it might be desirable to emit photons propagating along the nanotube axis , which is possible in optical transitions between the swnt subbands characterized by angular momenta differing by one .",
    "@xcite to achieve the emission of these photons by the electron heating , it is necessary to have an intersection of such subbands within the energy range accessible to electrons accelerated by attainable voltages . from our analysis of different types of swnts",
    ", it follows that the intersection is possible , e.g. , for the lowest conduction subbands in several semiconducting zigzag nanotubes and in all armchair nanotubes . however , for an effective thz emission from these nanotubes it is necessary to move the fermi level very close to the subband intersection point.@xcite therefore , obtaining the thz emission propagating along the nanotube axis is a much more difficult technological problem comparing to the generation of the emission shown in fig .",
    "swnt in a transverse electric field , @xmath43 v / nm.,width=302 ]    chiral nanotubes are natural superlattices . for example , a @xmath44 single - wall nanotube has a radius which differs from the radius of the most commonly studied @xmath45 nanotube by less than five per cent , whereas a translational period along the axis of the @xmath44 swnt is almost thirty times larger than the period of the @xmath45 nanotube . correspondingly , the first brillouin zone of the @xmath44 nanotube is almost thirty times smaller than the first zone for the @xmath45 tube .",
    "however such a brillouin zone reduction can not influence electronic transport unless there is a gap opening between the energy subbands resulting from the folding of graphene spectrum . in our research",
    "we show how an electric field normal to the nanotube axis opens noticeable gaps at the edge of the reduced brillouin zone , thus turning a long - period nanotube of certain chirality into a ` real ' superlattice .",
    "the field - induced gaps are most pronounced in @xmath46 swnts.@xcite figure  [ fig3 ] shows the opening of electric - field induced gap near the edge of the brillouin zone of a @xmath47 swnt .",
    "swnt as a function of the longitudinal electric field , in the presence of acoustic phonons.,width=377 ]    this gap opening results in the appearance of a negative effective - mass region in the nanotube energy spectrum .",
    "the typical electron energy in this part of the spectrum of 15 mev is well below the optical phonon energy @xmath48 mev , so that it can be easily accessed in moderate heating electric fields .",
    "the negative effective mass results in the negative differential conductivity in a wide range of applied voltages , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "the effect of the negative effective mass also leads to an efficient frequency multiplication in the thz range .",
    "the results of our calculations of the electron velocity in the presence of the time dependent longitudinal electric field are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "swnt under the influence of a pump harmonic longitudinal electric field , @xmath49 , and its correspondent spectral distribution @xmath50 : ( a ) in the ballistic transport regime ; ( b ) in the presence of scattering with the relaxation time @xmath51.,width=604 ]    one of the advantages of a frequency multiplier based on chiral swnts , in comparison with the conventional superlattices,@xcite is that the dispersion relation in our system can be controlled by the transverse electric field @xmath52 .",

    "( b )  detailed view of the gap , which is opened between the top valence subband and the lowest conduction subband in an external field @xmath53 t .",
    "( c )  the change in the dipole optical transitions matrix elements , for the light polarized along the swnt axis , due to the introduction of the external magnetic field .",
    "the only appreciable change is in the appearance of a high narrow peak associated with the transition @xmath54 , which is not allowed in the absence of the magnetic field .",
    "( d )  dependence of the squared dipole matrix element for the transition @xmath55 on the 1d wave vector @xmath1 , with and without an external magnetic field.,width=415 ]    the problem of detecting thz radiation is known to be at least as challenging as creating reliable thz sources .",
    "our proposal of a novel detector is based on several features of the truly gapless ( armchair ) swnts .",
    "the main property to be utilized is the opening of the gap in these swnts in a magnetic field along the nanotube axis@xcite . for a @xmath45 swnt",
    "this gap is approximately 1.6  thz in the field of 10  t. for attainable magnetic fields , the gap grows linearly with increasing both magnetic field and the nanotube radius .",
    "it can be shown@xcite that the same magnetic field also allows dipole optical transitions between the top valence subband and the lowest conduction subband , which are strictly forbidden in armchair swnts without the field.@xcite    in figure  [ fig6 ] we show how the energy spectrum and the matrix elements of the dipole optical transitions polarized along the nanotube axis are modified in the presence of a longitudinal magnetic field . in the frame of the nearest - neighbor tight binding model , one can show that for a @xmath15 armchair nanotube the squared matrix element of the velocity operator between the states at the edge of the gap opened by the magnetic field is given by a simple analytic expression : @xmath56v^2_f , \\label{mag_field_dipole}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 . for experimentally attainable magnetic fields , when the magnetic flux through the swnt is much smaller than the flux quantum ,",
    "the absolute value of the velocity operator is close to @xmath58 .",
    "equation  ( [ mag_field_dipole ] ) is relevant to the transitions between the highest valence subband and the the lowest conduction subband only for @xmath59 , since for the higher values of @xmath60 the order of the nanotube subbands is changed .",
    "notably , the same equation allows to obtain the maximum value of the velocity operator in any armchair swnt for the transitions polarized along its axis : this value can not exceed @xmath61 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig6]c ) .",
    "swnt , for three different magnetic field values .",
    "the absorption intensity is proportional to the product of @xmath62 and the joint density of states .",
    "( b )  dependence of the position of the peak in the absorption intensity , associated with the van hove singularity , on the magnetic field.,width=434 ]    the electron ( hole ) energy spectrum near the bottom ( top ) of the gap produced by the magnetic field is parabolic as a function of a carrier momentum along the nanotube axis .",
    "this dispersion results in a van hove singularity in the reduced density of states , which in turn leads to a very sharp absorption maximum near the band edge and , correspondingly , to a very high sensitivity of the photocurrent to the photon frequency , see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] .",
    "14truecm    notably , the same effect can be used for the generation of a very narrow emission line having the peak frequency tunable by the applied magnetic field .",
    "a population inversion can be achieved , for example , by optical pumping with the light polarized normally to the nanotube axis , as shown in fig .",
    "we have demonstrated that a quasi - metallic carbon nanotube can emit the thz radiation when the potential difference is applied to its ends .",
    "the typical required voltages and nanotube parameters are similar to those available in the state - of - the - art transport experiments .",
    "the maximum of the spectral density of emission is shown to have the strong voltage dependence , which is universal for all quasi - metallic carbon nanotubes in the ballistic regime .",
    "therefore , the discussed effect can be used for creating a thz source with the frequency controlled by the applied voltage .",
    "appropriately arranged arrays of the nanotubes should be considered as promising candidates for active elements of amplifiers and generators of the coherent thz radiation .    we have also shown that an electric field , which is applied normally to the axis of long - period chiral nanotubes , significantly modifies their band structure near the edge of the brillouin zone .",
    "this results in the negative effective mass region at the energy scale below the high - energy phonon emission threshold .",
    "this effect can be used for an efficient frequency multiplication in the thz range .",
    "finally , we have discussed the feasibility of using the effect of the magnetic field , which opens the energy gaps and allows optical transitions in armchair nanotubes , for tunable thz detectors and emitters .",
