    "a number of catastrophic astrophysical events , such as the collapse of the iron core in type - ii supernovae or the merger of a binary system of neutron stars , lead to the formation of a compact object with a large amount of angular momentum .",
    "clearly , uniform rotation is not an efficient way of sustaining such large rotation rates and it is far easier to obtain an equilibrium by distributing the angular momentum differentially in radius . at the same time",
    ", for a given amount of mass involved in the event , the knowledge of the law of differential rotation is important in establishing how close or how far the equilibrium configuration attained is from the instability threshold of the gravitational collapse to a black hole . on the basis of these considerations ,",
    "it is clear that the problem of determining the law of differential rotation produced in these events is an important one .    over the last 15 years",
    ", a large number of works have explored this problem in full general relativity , either through the construction of equilibrium configurations @xcite or through their dynamical production in core - collapse supernovae ( see @xcite for an overview ) or in binary neutron star mergers ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . lacking a physically motivated law of differential rotation ,",
    "essentially all of these works have assumed that the rotation law is particularly simple and such that the specific angular momentum @xmath3 is constant , with @xmath4 being the specific enthalpy and @xmath5 the covariant azimuthal component of the four - velocity .",
    "this law obviously satisfies the rayleigh criterion for local dynamical stability against axisymmetric perturbations , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the angular velocity .",
    "more importantly , however , it has the advantage of being analytically simple , with the angular velocity decreasing _ monotonically _ from the center of the star and with the degree of differential rotation being regulated by a single dimensionless parameter ( normally referred to as @xmath8 ) . only recently , ref .",
    "@xcite has made the first attempts to generalize the space of equilibria by considering more general prescriptions for the law of differential rotation , using however analytical simplicity as the guideline .",
    "overall , all the studies carried out so far on equilibrium sequences of stationary models agree that when using a @xmath0 law of differential rotation , several different solutions are possible for a given degree of differential rotation @xcite and that the maximum mass depends on both the degree of differential rotation and on the type of solution , reaching values as large as four times that of the maximum mass of nonrotating configurations @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this is to be contrasted with what happens in the case of uniformly - rotating models , where the maximum mass has recently been found to be only 20% larger than @xmath9 , quite independently of the eos @xcite .",
    "while the @xmath0 law of differential rotation has been useful so far to explore the equilibria of differentially rotating compact stars , it is also hard to justify on physical grounds , in particular when considering the results of numerical simulations of merging binary neutron stars . a number of studies in this direction , in fact , have shown that although the merger normally leads to the formation of a hypermassive neutron star ( hmns ) , that is , a neutron star whose mass exceeds the maximum mass of a uniformly rotating star , the law of differential rotation is rather different  @xcite .",
    "hence , the need to determine a law of differential rotation that , albeit not simpler , does reflect the hydrodynamical equilibrium that is attained in hmnss produced in binary neutron - star mergers .",
    "clearly , determining such a law of differential rotation is important since it has direct impacts on the maximum mass these objects can attain and hence on the threshold to black - hole formation under astrophysically realistic conditions .",
    "a first step in this direction has been taken in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the properties of the angular - velocity distribution in the merged object have been analyzed in detail , although only for a very limited number of binaries . in agreement with the previous simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite , these more recent works have found that the angular - velocity profile of the hmns shows a slowly rotating core and an envelope that rotates at quasi - keplerian frequencies .",
    "this holds true both when the initial data is that of irrotational binaries and when the binaries are artificially spun - up as done in ref .",
    "@xcite .    here",
    ", we adopt a more systematic approach and study the rotational properties of the hmnss produced by the merger of binary neutron stars described with various equations of state ( eoss ) and masses , and as computed via a large number of numerical simulations in full general relativity . besides confirming the more specific results of refs .",
    "@xcite , our most interesting finding is arguably that the angular - velocity distribution shows only a modest dependence on the eos , thus exhibiting the traits of `` quasi - universality '' that have been found in other aspects of compact stars , both when isolated @xcite and in binary systems @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the eos - independent angular - velocity distributions we find are characterized by an almost uniformly rotating core and a quasi - keplerian `` disk '' .    having a keplerian flow in the outer regions of the hmns is important for two reasons , at least .",
    "firstly , the keplerian disk surrounding the hmns will accrete onto the uniformly rotating core of the star only on a dissipative timescale , thus not affecting its long - term stability .",
    "secondly , once the core of the hmns eventually collapses to a rotating black hole , the presence of a certain amount of mass on stable keplerian orbits will guarantee that the black hole will not be `` naked '' , but surrounded by a torus , as expected when the collapse to a black hole is prompt @xcite .",
    "both of these considerations are important within the proto - magnetar model for short gamma - ray bursts  @xcite and the subsequent extended x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : numrel ] is dedicated to a brief overview of the mathematical and numerical setup employed in our simulations , while in secs .  [",
    "sec : hmb ] and  [ sec : lmb ] we illustrate the results obtained when modelling high- and low - mass binaries , respectively .",
    "we focus , in particular , on the distributions of rest - mass density and angular velocity , and illustrate our approach to obtain time and azimuthally averaged profiles .",
    "section [ sec : tracers ] focuses on the use of tracer particles to disentangle the physically meaningful results from the possible contamination of gauge effects , while sec .",
    "[ sec : qub ] discusses the `` quasi - universal '' features of the angular - velocity profiles and how to correlate them with the properties of the progenitor stars in the binary .",
    "also discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : qub ] are the amount of mass in the disk and the influence of the thermal component of the eos on the results presented . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : sum ] we present a summary of our findings and the impact they have on the stability of differentially rotating compact stars .",
    "hereafter , we will use a spacelike signature @xmath10 and a system of units in which @xmath11 unless stated differently .",
    "the mathematical and numerical setup used for the simulations reported here is the same discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and presented in greater detail in other papers @xcite . for completeness",
    "we review here only the basic aspects , referring the interested reader to the papers above for additional information .",
    "our simulations are performed in general relativity using the fourth - order finite - differencing code ` mclachlan ` @xcite , which is part of the publicly available ` einstein  toolkit `  @xcite .",
    "this code solves a conformal traceless formulation of the einstein equations @xcite , with a `` @xmath12 '' slicing condition and a `` gamma - driver '' shift condition @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the evolution of the general - relativistic hydrodynamics equations is done using the finite - volume code ` whisky ` @xcite , which has been extensively tested in simulations involving the inspiral and merger of binary neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamics equations , expressing the conservation of energy , momentum and rest mass @xcite , are cast in the conservative valencia formulation  @xcite . their numerical solution is obtained employing the harten - lax - van leer - einfeldt @xcite approximate riemann solver @xcite in conjunction with the piecewise parabolic method @xcite for the reconstruction of the evolved variables . for the time integration of the coupled set of hydrodynamic and einstein equations we use the method of lines with an explicit fourth - order runge - kutta method .",
    "our simulations use a cfl number of @xmath13 to compute the timestep .",
    "an adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) approach based on the ` carpet ` mesh - refinement driver  @xcite is used to both increase resolution and extend the spatial domain , placing the outer boundary as close as possible to the wave zone .",
    "the grid hierarchy consists of six refinement levels with a grid resolution varying from @xmath14 ( i.e. ,  @xmath15 ) for the finest level to @xmath16 ( i.e. ,  @xmath17 ) for the coarsest level , whose outer boundary is at @xmath18 ( i.e. ,  @xmath19 ) . to reduce computational costs , a reflection symmetry across the @xmath20 plane and a @xmath21-symmetry condition across the @xmath22 plane has been adopted .",
    "the initial configuration for the quasi - equilibrium irrotational binary neutron stars has been generated with the use of the ` lorene`-code  @xcite and an initial coordinate separation of the stellar centers of @xmath23 has been used for all binaries . for each eos , we have considered equal - mass binaries where each star has initial gravitational masses that are either @xmath24 ( low - mass binaries ; cf .",
    "[ sec : lmb ] ) or @xmath25 ( high - mass binaries ; cf .",
    "[ sec : hmb ] ) at infinite separation .",
    "a quantity that is particularly important in our analysis is the angular velocity , @xmath7 , which is defined as the amount of fluid rotation measured by a eulerian ( normal ) observer @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are components of the four - velocity vector @xmath29 .",
    "the corresponding three - velocity as measured by the same eulerian observer is then defined as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the lapse function , @xmath32 is the shift vector , @xmath33 is the unit timelike vector normal to a constant @xmath34 hypersurface , and @xmath35 is the three - dimensional metric . with the above definition the angular velocity within the @xmath36 split can be expressed as @xmath37 where",
    "@xmath38 are the three - velocity and shift vector components as computed from the cartesian grid with coordinates @xmath39 . written in this form",
    ", we can interpret @xmath7 as consisting of a lapse - corrected part of the @xmath40-component of the three - velocity , minus a frame - dragging term provided by the @xmath40-component of the shift vector .      to close the set of evolution equations",
    "an eos is needed and which provides a relation among the thermodynamical properties of the neutron - star matter .",
    "a general eos describes the pressure as a function of the rest - mass density , particle composition and temperature .",
    "however , for certain parts of the merger , simplified versions can be used . in particular , during the inspiral , a cold , i.e. ,  temperature independent , eos is sufficient to represent the state of the neutron - star matter prior to merger .",
    "after contact , when the hmns is formed , large shocks will increase the temperature and to account for this additional heating a full temperature dependent nuclear - physics eos is required . as the number of such eoss is unfortunately still limited , we include thermal effects by adding an ideal - fluid component that accounts for the shock heating . the pressure @xmath41 and the specific internal energy @xmath42 are therefore composed of a `` cold '' nuclear - physics part and of a `` thermal '' ideal - fluid component @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the pressure and specific internal energy , respectively .",
    "we model the cold part @xmath44 with five different nuclear - physics eoss .",
    "two of such eoss , namely apr4  @xcite and sly  @xcite , belong to the class of variational - method eoss and the underlying particle composition within these models consists mainly of neutrons with little admixtures of protons , electrons and muons .",
    "additionally , two more eoss , i.e. ,  gnh3  @xcite and h4  @xcite , are built using relativistic mean - field models which include , above a certain rest - mass density , hyperonic particles .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     another useful measure of the rest - mass distribution is that of the mass in the `` disk '' , which we define to be the rest mass confined in the region of the hmns in keplerian flow .",
    "more specifically , if @xmath45 is the radial location ( on the equatorial plane ) where the flow becomes keplerian ( i.e. ,  where @xmath46 ) , then we define the rest mass in the disk as @xmath47 .",
    "another interesting notion of mass is that that is inside the maximum value of the averaged angular - velocity profile .",
    "after defining @xmath48 as the location where the angular - velocity profile reaches its maximum , and recalling that i.e. ,  @xmath49 , we can calculate the mass inside @xmath48 using the same expression ; we refer to this mass as to @xmath50 .",
    "the masses in the keplerian disk surrounding the quasi - uniformly rotating inner core of the hmns and that outside the angular - velocity maximum are summarised in table [ tab : results ] for all of the binaries simulated .",
    "overall , they indicate that the mass outside @xmath48 and the mass outside @xmath51 are rather similar ( the former being slightly larger since since @xmath52 ) and can be quite large , being almost @xmath53 for some of the soft - eos low - mass binaries and of the order of @xmath54 for the other binaries .",
    "the final section of this paper is dedicated to assessing the impact of the thermal component of the eos on the results presented so far , further extending the discussion made in sec .",
    "[ sec : tracers ] .",
    "we recall , in fact , that with the exception of the ls220 eos , all of our eoss do not have a nuclear - physics thermal component and that thermal effects are accounted for via a hybrid eos in which an ideal - fluid contribution is added to the total pressure ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : eos ] for details ) .",
    "the choice of the adiabatic index @xmath55 is somewhat arbitrary ( the only mathematical constraint being that @xmath56 , but see discussion in  @xcite ) . since the value of @xmath55 regulates the amount of thermal pressure produced after merger and hence , to some extent , the equilibrium properties of the hmns , it is worth investigating its effects on the rest - mass density and angular - velocity distributions .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : omegaradius - gth1 ] for the ` alf2-m125 ` binary , but the results are similar for other binaries .",
    "we indicate with green ( black ) solid , dashed and dotted lines the averaged angular velocity ( rest - mass density ) profiles for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "the curves are obtained after averaging in the azimuthal direction and over a time interval [ @xmath59 .",
    "figure [ fig : omegaradius - gth1 ] shows that a larger value of @xmath55 yields a larger pressure support and hence prevents the matter in the hmns to reach large values of compression .",
    "this explains why the maximum rest - mass density is larger for smaller values of the thermal adiabatic index ( see black lines ) . in turn , since a larger pressure support implies that the hmns is less compact ( compressed ) and since the angular momentum is essentially the same for the binaries with different @xmath55 considered here , it is not surprising that the maximum value of the averaged angular velocity increases as the contribution of the thermal component is decreased ( see green lines ) .",
    "what is possibly more important to note is that the changes induced by the different values of @xmath55 are quantitative only and also rather small , i.e. ,  with relative variations of @xmath60 in the angular velocity .",
    "the qualitative behaviour , however , remains unchanged , most notably in the keplerian part of the flow , thus removing the influence of the thermal component of the eos as a potential bias in our analysis .    .",
    "the time and azimuthal averages have been performed in the same manner as in fig .  [ fig : omegaradius ] . ]",
    "establishing the long - term stability properties of astrophysical compact objects produced in catastrophic events , such as in type - ii core collapse supernovae or in the merger of binary systems of neutron stars , is an old and important problem .",
    "while it is clear that the large angular momentum that these objects attain can not be sustained via uniform rotation , far less clear is what is the law of differential rotation that is reached in quasi - stationary equilibria .",
    "more importantly , it is not yet known whether this law depends sensitively on the eos of the compact object or is instead `` universal '' .    notwithstanding these conceptual obstacles ,",
    "a large bulk of literature has developed over the last decade to explore this problem in full general relativity , either through the study of equilibrium configurations or via numerical relativity simulations that produce these objects dynamically .",
    "works in the first class have commonly modelled differential rotation through a particularly simple law expressing that the specific angular momentum is constant on cylinders . in this @xmath61 law ,",
    "angular velocity decreases _ monotonically _ from the center of the star and the degree of differential rotation is expressed via a single dimensionless parameter .",
    "however , a number of simulations of merging binary neutron stars have given evidence that the angular - velocity profile of the hmns produced at the merger is characterized by a slowly rotating core and an envelope that rotates at quasi - keplerian frequencies .",
    "this is very different from what is expected when using a @xmath0 law of differential rotation .    to shed some light on these differences , and to obtain a comprehensive picture of the rotational properties of hmnss from binary neutron - star mergers ,",
    "we have carried out a large number of numerical simulations in full general relativity of binary neutron stars described with various eoss and masses .",
    "we have been able to confirm the earlier results of refs .",
    "@xcite , but , more importantly , to show that the angular - velocity distribution shows only a modest dependence on the eos , thus exhibiting the traits of `` quasi - universality '' .",
    "more specifically , the eos - independent angular - velocity distributions we find are characterized by an almost uniformly rotating core and a quasi - keplerian `` disk '' .",
    "the rest mass contained in such disk can be quite large , ranging from @xmath62 in the case of high - mass binaries with stiff eoss , up to @xmath2 for low - mass binaries with soft eoss .",
    "the presence of a keplerian flow in the outer regions of the hmns implies that the disk will only accrete onto the uniformly rotating core on a dissipative timescale , thus not affecting the long - term stability of the latter .",
    "the final fate of this disk when the lifetime of the hmns is expected to be very large ( i.e. ,  larger than @xmath63 s and up to @xmath64 s @xcite ) is hard to assess through self - consistent numerical simulations .",
    "however , its dynamics has been recently conjectured within the `` two - winds '' model presented in ref .",
    "@xcite to explain the extended x - ray emission observed in a class of short gamma - ray bursts .",
    "in essence , the expectation is that because the material in the outer regions is on keplerian orbits , it could be subject to a magnetorotational instability @xcite and hence behave as a standard accretion disk onto a rapidly rotating magnetized star . in this case , the differential rotation will not brake the rotation but transport angular momentum outwards .",
    "a good fraction of the material in this disk will therefore remain on quasi - keplerian orbits on the much longer viscous accretion timescale , hence leading to the production of a massive torus around the black hole .",
    "clearly , if the mass in the torus is very small , then it will become difficult to find the energy reservoir needed to launch and sustain the jet that is required in the two - winds model .",
    "however , given that at least 10% of a solar mass is present in the keplerian disk after 20 ms after the merger , it is sufficient that only 10% of this mass is channelled into a torus around the newly formed black hole to provide a sufficient amount of energy to power a relativistic jet .",
    "more work is needed to fully explore the consequences of this scenario and also to assess the impact that neutrino - driven winds may have on the survival of the disk @xcite .    on a final note",
    "we should also draw attention to the fact that the simulations presented in this work did not account for magnetic fields .",
    "the importance of magnetic fields in the post - merger dynamics has been discussed in recent works  @xcite . during merger",
    "a vortex sheet develops where the tangential component of the velocity is discontinuous .",
    "such a shear interface is unstable to perturbations and can develop the so - called kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "if the magnetic - field of the merging neutron stars is poloidal , this instability may lead to an exponential growth of their toroidal component  @xcite , curling poloidal field lines and generating a turbulent flow . resolving the growth and saturation of the kelvin - helmholtz instability is a challenging computational issue , especially for realistic ( pulsar - like ) magnetic field strengths .",
    "the latest , highest resolution simulations to date of  @xcite for initial magnetic fields of moderate strength ( @xmath65 g ) show that the amplification factor of the field is @xmath66 at @xmath67 ms after merger , with a saturation magnetic field - energy @xmath68 erg , i.e. ,  @xmath69 of the bulk kinetic energy of the merging neutron stars .",
    "although the magnetic energy is still much smaller than the bulk kinetic energy and unable to produce significant changes in the inspiral @xcite , these results and the possibility that even stronger amplification could be achieved , suggest the importance to consider strong magnetic fields for modelling the post - merger evolution of binary neutron stars .",
    "investigating the effect of such fields on the rotational properties of the hmnss discussed in this paper is a well - justified future undertaking .",
    "we thank b. mundim , n. grlebeck , m. g. alford and w. kastaun for useful discussions and comments .",
