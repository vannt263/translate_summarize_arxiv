    "note that , as the separation of these stellar components is performed on the basis of their binding energy content , the ihps and ohps can be spatially superposed .",

    "thus , we will hereafter consider that the ohps are built up mainly by debris stars from accreted sub - galactic systems , with a small fraction corresponding to endo - debris stars .",
    "a similar analysis was carried out for the stars in the ihps .",

    "one of the six ohps ( aq - g-5 ) has a mean @xmath80 km s@xmath67 , and another ( aq - c-5 ) exhibits a retrograde net rotation @xmath81 km s@xmath67 . at least in our simulations ,",
    "the stars are very well - mixed dynamically , so no significant differences in the toomre diagram could be found between the debris stars and the endo - debris stars , or between the low- and high-[@xmath2/fe ] sub - populations ( left panel of fig .  [ toomrehaloex ] ) .    the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ toomrehaloex ] shows the [ o / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] plane for the debris and endo - debris sub - populations .",
    "it is very clear that the endo - debris sub - populations exhibit a larger contribution from low-[@xmath2/fe ] stars , on average .",
    "however , there is no trend with rotational velocity , as can be seen from the right panel of fig .",
    "[ toomrehaloex ] . the existence ( or absence ) of such stars",
    "might be tested with observations ; their frequency could provide strong constraints on galaxy - formation models and on how the star - formation activity proceeded in small systems at high redshift .",
    "note that most of the stars in the ohps are located outside the solar neighbourhood ; less than @xmath82 can be found within this region ( tissera et al . in preparation ) , thus caution should be taken when compared to available observational surveys .",
    "previous works have reported the existence of a ` gradient ' in the metallicity of stars in the simulated halo systems by considering the difference between the so - called ihrs and ohrs . in paper",
    "i , we measured the difference between the median [ fe / h ] of the ihrs and ohrs , finding that simulations were capable of reproducing values similar to those estimated in the the mw @xcite . however , if the analysis is restricted only to the ohrs , one might expect little or no metallicity gradients , at least if the stars from the accreted sub - galactic systems were well - mixed . in paper",
    "i , we found that the median [ fe / h ] ( [ o / fe ] ) of our ohps are correlated ( anti - correlated ) with the fractions of stars coming from massive satellites , indicating that some memory of the history of formation may still remain in this component .",
    "below we check on this possibility , assuming that their formation histories are consistent with those predicted by a hierarchical clustering scenario .",
    "[ gradhaloex ] shows the median [ fe / h ] and [ o / fe ] profiles for the ohps in our six simulated halo systems . for [ fe / h ]",
    ", there is considerable variation in both the level of enrichment and the predicted slopes with galactocentric distance .",
    "we also note that , although this component has been defined to be smooth , the abundance distributions might still reveal their complex assembly histories as shown by @xmath83 -@xmath36 in paper i ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this is particularly clear from the [ @xmath2/fe ] profiles plotted in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ gradhaloex ] , where the contributions from the sub - populations with different levels of @xmath2-enrichment as a function of galactocentric radius can be seen .    for the [ fe / h ] profiles ,",
    "a linear regression was fit between @xmath7 kpc and @xmath84 kpc , in order to avoid the central and very outer parts of the distributions , which might be affected by the ihps and the boundaries of the systems , respectively .",
    "[ corre ] shows the slope and zero points , as a function of the fraction of stars formed in more massive sub - galactic systems ( m @xmath85 m@xmath73 ) .",
    "as expected from the results already discussed in paper i , the zero point shows a trend indicating higher metallicities in ohps formed from larger contributions of debris stars acquired from relative more - massive systems .",
    "although the slopes vary from mild to flat , there is a trend with @xmath86 such that steeper negative slopes are found in diffuse ohps formed with significant contributions from relatively higher - mass systems .",
    "massive sub - galactic systems would tend to survive farther into the potential wells , carrying relatively more metal - rich stars and gas available for star formation toward the central regions .",
    "the ohps received a significant contributions of debris from relatively lower - mass satellites will tend to be better - mixed , and exhibit more homogeneous chemical distributions .    in order to better understand the differences in the abundance gradients , we also analysed the ages , spatial distributions , and binding energy distributions of the simulated ohps .",
    "we found that the oldest stars are less metal - enriched , as expected , and they span a larger range of total energy and radial distances .",
    "relatively higher - metallicity stars tend to be more gravitationally bound , and are more centrally concentrated .",
    "the outer portions of the ohps are dominated by high - energy stars , which are also the oldest and the lowest metallicity . to illustrate this , fig .",
    "[ binding ] shows the distribution of binding energies for stars in the simulated ohps , segregated according to [ fe / h ] .",
    "the two haloes with the flattest metallicity profiles are those that have similar total energy distributions for stars of different [ fe / h ] abundances . those with the steeper slopes possess relatively higher - metallicity stars predominantly at low total energies . as discussed previously , relatively more - massive satellites contribute higher - metallicity stars .",
    "thus , the existence of a gradient in the ohps is a consequence of the properties of the accreted satellites , and how they were disrupted within the potential well of the systems .",
    "this might explain why analytical models grafted onto the purely dynamical versions of the aquarius systems obtained flatter slopes @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive discussion on the metallicity gradients of both ihps and ohps is considered in tissera et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , together with comparisions with recent observations . accordingly ,",
    "our results indicate that the observed metallicity gradient in the diffuse ohr of a galaxy such as the mw can provide clues about the mass distributions of the satellites that contributed to its formation .",
    "we have analysed a suite of six mw mass - sized systems , simulated within @xmath5cdm using a version of p - gadget3 that includes a prescription for self - consistent sn feedback .",
    "this scheme allows us to follow the chemo - dynamical evolution of baryons as they are assembled into galaxies .",
    "our simulated diffuse stellar haloes can be described as assembled from three stellar sub - populations : debris , endo - debris and disc - heated stars .",
    "debris stars formed in separate sub - galactic systems located outside the virial radius of the main progenitor galaxies at their time of formation .",
    "these sub - galactic systems were later accreted by the main progenitor galaxies , donating stars primary to the ohps , but as well as to ihps .",
    "the endo - debris sub - populations formed in gas - rich sub - galactic systems within the virial radius of the main progenitor galaxies .",
    "these systems were disrupted farther in the potential well , contributing stars primarily to the ihps , and to a lesser degree , to the ohps .",
    "disc - heated stars can represent a significant percentage of the ihps .",
    "these sub - populations are distinguished from one another as they exhibit , on average , stars of different chemical abundances , ages , kinematics , and binding energies .",
    "the relative fractions of debris stars and endo - debris stars provides clues to the mass distribution ( and relative number ) of the sub - galactic systems that contribute to form the stellar haloes .",
    "these results have clear implications for observational studies that attempt to identify different populations in the mw and other galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "summary of the main results :    the simulated ihps possess three clear stellar sub - populations  the debris stars , the endo - debris stars , and the disc - heated stars .",
    "debris stars are @xmath2-enhanced relative to iron , low metallicity , and on average , show no clear signals for rotation .",
    "endo - debris stars exhibit lower @xmath2-enhancement than debris ones , on average .",
    "endo - debris stars could be associated with the stars observed and classified by @xcite as accreted stars . in our simulations endo - debris stars exhibit larger velocity dispersions , on average , than the disc - heated stars .",
    "disc - heated stars are less @xmath2-enhanced and more metal - rich compared to the endo - debris stars , with characteristics that depend on their ages .",
    "disc - heated stars with ages greater then @xmath87 gyr are dominated by their dispersion , while those with ages in the range @xmath88 gyr have a larger rotational velocity component , and exhibit solar to sub - solar [ @xmath2/fe ] ratios .",
    "although it is feasible , on average , to distinguish these different components by comparing their chemical abundances and kinematic properties , there exists considerable overlap between these sub - populations .    the simulated ihps exhibit metallicity gradients , the strength of which are determined by the relative fractions of the three sub - populations that contributed to their formation . while the endo - debris and disc - heated stars dominate in the central parts of ihrs ( within @xmath89 kpc )",
    ", the debris stars dominate in the outer parts of the ihrs .",
    "hence , the relative contributions of the different sub - populations can conspire to produce steeper metallicity gradients than those exhibit by each sub - populations separately .",
    "the simulated ohps are primarily comprised of debris stars that formed in accreted sub - galactic systems .",
    "the relatively less - massive systems are easily disrupted , while the relatively more - massive ones are able to survive farther into the global potential well of the system before being disrupted . as a consequence , although stars of the ohps are generally of very low metallicity , the relatively more metal - rich ones tend to be more centrally concentrated . some of the ohps show signals of weak prograte rotation ( @xmath90 v@xmath55).the relative distribution of debris stars from these different accreted sub - galactic systems can result in a genuine metallicity gradient within the ohrs , which although weak , can be used to constrain the assembly history of the ohps .",
    "the [ @xmath2/fe ] ratios exhibit a heterogeneous distribution from simulated galaxy - to - galaxy , reflecting the mixture of contributions from accreted galactic systems with different star - formation histories .",
    "a future comparison between the frequency of low-[@xmath2/fe ] stars in the haloes can provide clues on the history of formation and the masses of the accreted systems , as well as on the validity of current chemical - enrichment schemes .    in this paper",
    ", we have studied the ihps and ohps as separate sub - populations in relation to their assembly histories in a cosmological context .",
    "the properties of the combined ihps and ohps will be discussed in a forthcoming paper , which considers comparisons of the nature of the observed stellar populations in the mw , m31 , and and other nearby galaxies with predictions from the simulations .",
