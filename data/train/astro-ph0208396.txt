    "atmospheric cherenkov detectors can not be calibrated using a test beam and the estimation of their sensitivity strongly depends on monte carlo simulation programs in which are modeled the atmosphere and the various elements of the detectors . simulations usually assume a set of fixed conditions while the overall efficiency of the experiment can vary in time due to a number of factors .",
    "the most important cause of these variations is the atmosphere itself , and measuring and modeling changes in the @xmath0-ray detection efficiency due to changing atmospheric conditions is complex . the slow degradation of optical elements until their recoating or replacement or the occasional readjustment of photo - detector gains also affects the sensitivity of the experiment .",
    "when measuring the @xmath0-ray flux from a source , one must correct for these effects .    in this paper",
    "we present a method used for the whipple atmospheric cherenkov imaging telescope to estimate an overall relative efficiency factor .",
    "we also validate the method using observations of the crab nebula and present some applications . in its basic form",
    "the method is based on the analysis of data taken toward the zenith @xcite and this is presented first .",
    "we have realized that the method can be generalized in a way which incorporates the effects of the zenith angle at which observations are made .",
    "while detailed simulations will always be necessary in order to understand variations in telescope sensitivity , a simple correction such as that presented here is a useful tool which may be particularly important when studying the time variability of @xmath0-ray sources .",
    "an example of this is the case of flaring active galactic nuclei ( agn ) which may be observed over a long period of time and a wide range of zenith angles and atmospheric conditions .",
    "we also present the application of a similar method to celeste , a cherenkov wavefront sampling experiment , which illustrates the utility of the technique as a way of obtaining a relative calibration between individual elements of a detector array .",
    "each recorded cherenkov event can be characterized by its luminosity , @xmath1 , the definition of which may depend on the specific experiment . a relative throughput factor , @xmath2 , between two observation times",
    "can then be defined as the ratio between the luminosity produced by the same atmospheric shower observed at the same zenith angle but under the two different conditions . for data obtained with the whipple @xmath3 telescope @xcite",
    ", we define the luminosity of an event as the sum of the signals in all the photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) that gave a significant contribution to the image @xcite . in order to effectively estimate the throughput factor we use the fact that the cosmic ray spectrum is constant at the energies we observe @xcite , and therefore differences in the distribution of @xmath1 obtained at the same zenith angle with the same detector should only reflect variations in light collection efficiency and gain of the experiment .",
    "practically , in the whipple data analysis , we construct the histogram of @xmath1 obtained from the zenith observations during a specific night .",
    "this is then used as a reference for the other nights to be calibrated . for each of the other nights we construct the histogram of @xmath4 , with @xmath2 being a test value for the relative gain between the night to be calibrated and the reference night .",
    "we then adjust @xmath2 until the distribution best fits the reference one .",
    "when applying this process one must take care to avoid the regions of the @xmath1 distribution where the effects of threshold and saturation of the experiment become important .",
    "the whipple telescope focal plane detector is equipped with light collecting cones which reduce the dead space between the photomultiplier tube pixels .",
    "the actual light collection improvement due to the cones is given by a combination of their optical properties and the shape and size of the main optics as seen from the focal plane .",
    "this factor is usually estimated by simulations based on measurements performed in the lab under simplified conditions .",
    "here we try to quantify this factor using the method described in the previous section by taking some data toward the zenith with and without the cones installed .",
    "the comparison of the two sets of data is presented in figure  [ cones ] .",
    "the data with the cones are used as a reference and a relative throughput factor is calculated for the data obtained without the cones . from this",
    "we estimate that the cones are responsible for @xmath5 of the cherenkov light collection efficiency of the telescope .",
    "this result matches very well with the previous estimates ( f.krennrich , private communication ) .",
    "every night , the whipple telescope operator records his estimate of the sky quality on a qualitative scale ranging from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "data that were obtained under sky qualities less than @xmath8 are often rejected . in figure",
    "[ weather ] we show the average throughput factor as a function of the observer s estimate of sky quality , with the vertical error bars indicating the standard deviation .",
    "it appears that the throughput factor increases as the sky quality improves but the plot also shows that some of the data obtained under a @xmath9 sky could very well be used .",
    "cirrus cloud occurs typically at an altitude of @xmath10 , with night to night variations of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the majority of the cherenkov light produced by air showers is emitted near to the shower maximum ( the altitude at which the number of particles in the shower is greatest ) which is @xmath10 for showers initiated by a @xmath12 @xmath0-ray .",
    "it is possible , therefore , that the observer can be influenced in his judgment of the weather conditions by some high altitude cirrus clouds which could be responsible for an increase in the sky background brightness without affecting the quantity of cherenkov light collected by the telescope .",
    "there will also be occasions when the telescope was aimed between the clouds during the observation .",
    "because of this , the idea of calculating the throughput factor using a single test run with the telescope pointing to the zenith is invalid , as the results can not be applied to other observations on the same night .",
    "this is one of the motivations for generalizing the method to any zenith angle .",
    "the relative throughput calibration method as described above already allows us to correct for changes in the telescope which affect the light collection efficiency , as well as helping with data selection .",
    "nevertheless , it is based on data obtained at a fixed zenith angle , which can not be strictly contemporaneous with the astronomical observations of interest .",
    "therefore it can not be used with confidence to make corrections to the data .",
    "it is , in principle , possible to apply the same method to compare data obtained at different zenith angles .",
    "the value of @xmath2 then results from differences in atmospheric transparency as well as differences in the detection geometry which affect both the energy threshold and the effective @xmath0-ray collection area .",
    "when observations are made at lower zenith angles the atmospheric showers produce a cherenkov light pool which extends over a larger area @xcite .",
    "figure  [ principle ] shows how the throughput factor @xmath2 corresponds to a combination of two effects .",
    "factor @xmath13 measures the horizontal shift in the distribution caused by changes in the light collection efficiency which result from changes in the instrument and atmospheric conditions as well as from differences in zenith angle .",
    "factor @xmath7 measures the vertical shift ( a change in the number of showers observed with a given luminosity ) caused by changes in the effective @xmath0-ray collection area due to different source zenith angles . only the factor @xmath2 can be directly measured from the event luminosity distributions .",
    "as the radius of the cherenkov light pool is defined only by the atmospheric density profile and source zenith angle , factors @xmath13 and @xmath7 should show the same zenith angle dependence for both @xmath0-ray and cosmic - ray initiated showers as long as most of the cherenkov light is emitted from the core of the shower .",
    "this allows us to use a generalized throughput factor in our analysis of @xmath0-ray signals .      in figure  [ zendep ]",
    "the throughput factor is shown as a function of @xmath14 , the distance from the zenith .",
    "the reference data were taken at @xmath15 from the zenith and so @xmath2 is close to one at this point .",
    "it can be shown that if the atmospheric density profile is assumed isothermal , the area of the cherenkov light pool is proportional to @xmath16 ( see appendix ) . using this , for a luminosity distribution of differential power law index @xmath17 ,",
    "the throughput factor is expected to vary as    @xmath18    [ zen1 ]    where the exponential term is used to describe the atmospheric attenuation of cherenkov light . for our observed @xmath19",
    "we have    @xmath20    [ zen2 ]    this function gives the curves shown on figure  [ zendep ] for three different empirically derived values of @xmath21 .",
    "points falling near the upper curve would correspond to data obtained under the best atmospheric conditions while points on the lower curve correspond to data obtained under poorer conditions .",
    "we can see on this figure that variations of @xmath22 arise in the event luminosity even when the observer estimated the sky quality to be good ( more than 90% of these observations where graded as @xmath7 or @xmath8 weather by the observer ) .",
    "variations of this magnitude must be corrected for in order to establish accurate @xmath0-ray fluxes , particularly in the case of sources with steep spectra .    in order to use the throughput value to correct the measured @xmath0-ray rate",
    ", we must verify that the @xmath0-ray showers are affected by changes in zenith angle , instrument efficiency and atmospheric transparency in approximately the same way as the background cosmic ray showers which are used to derive the throughput factor .",
    "we do this by looking at the @xmath0-ray rate observed in the direction of the crab nebula : the crab is the standard candle of tev @xmath0-ray astronomy and dedicated studies ( using selected data taken close to zenith and under good weather conditions ) have shown its emission at these energies to be constant over a timescale of years @xcite .",
    "if the throughput factor is applied correctly , the crab nebula @xmath0-ray rate after correction should remain stable within statistical errors over all elevations and weather conditions    there are different ways in which one could apply the correction .",
    "one possible method is to apply the throughput correction directly to the measured cherenkov photon yield in each pmt , prior to parameterization of the images .",
    "the drawback here is that the signal to noise ratio will not remain constant over the range of throughput factors and zenith angles , and so the efficiency of the @xmath0-ray selection cuts will also change . in addition , for observations where the correction factor is large , the hardware trigger threshold will bias the number of images which pass the selection cuts .",
    "because of this , we prefer to apply the correction directly to the measured rate .",
    "this is only strictly accurate if the spectrum of @xmath0-rays from the source follows a simple power law of known spectral index .",
    "we try here to correct the @xmath0-ray rate separately for the zenith angle and atmospheric transparency effects .",
    "the zenith angle dependence of the @xmath0-ray rate is ideally calculated using monte carlo simulations ; here we use a simple analytical model which provides a good approximation .",
    "the effective collection area , @xmath7 , and threshold energy , @xmath23 , are both proportional to @xmath24 and so the @xmath0-ray rate @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the integral @xmath0-ray power law spectral index . for the crab nebula , @xmath27 @xcite and so @xmath28 .",
    "this can be used to correct the measured @xmath0-ray rate to the rate expected at a fixed zenith angle ; we choose to calculate the corrected rate for a zenith angle of @xmath29 , @xmath30 .    to apply the throughput correction",
    "we first calculate the expected throughput factor , @xmath31 , normalized to a zenith angle of @xmath29 ( because the measured throughput factor @xmath32 has been calculated with reference to an observation taken at a zenith angle of @xmath29 ) such that :    @xmath33    [ fexp ]    this is equivalent to equation  2 but without atmospheric attenuation .",
    "the effects of atmospheric attenuation are automatically incorporated in the throughput correction , which we use to calculate the corrected rate as follows :    @xmath34    [ tp ]    figure  [ crab_tp ] shows @xmath30 as a function of zenith angle and of @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath0-ray rate is constant with zenith angle after the zenith angle correction , while there is clearly still a correlation with the throughput correction which is well fit by a power law of index @xmath27 , as expected for the crab .",
    "figure  [ crab_el ] shows the reduction in the width of the rate distributions at each stage of the correction .",
    "we note , however , that the width of this distribution is not the best measure of the effectiveness of the correction .",
    "observations at large zenith angles often result in a measurement which is not statistically significant and so the width of the distribution for these runs will be dominated by statistical fluctuations .",
    "most of these crab data were taken under good weather conditions ; the throughput correction will play an even stronger role when trying to analyse data taken under poorer conditions .",
    "markarian 421 ( mrk421 ) is a bright tev @xmath0-ray source which has been well studied and is known to be extremely variable @xcite . during the 2000/2001 observing season this source",
    "was in the most active state yet observed @xcite , with an average tev @xmath0-ray flux of 1.5 times the steady flux from the crab nebula .",
    "measurements in the @xmath36 x - ray region were also made by the all sky monitor ( asm ) on board the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) .",
    "multiwavelength studies of the variable emission from agn are extremely important to our understanding of the nature of the particles and acceleration mechanisms in jets . in the 2000/2001 whipple observations of mrk421",
    ", data were taken whenever possible , including at low zenith angles and during poor weather , so as to provide the best possible sampling of the @xmath0-ray light curve .",
    "the throughput factor provides us with a method to treat these data in a consistent fashion .",
    "observations of mrk421 for the night of march @xmath37 2001 are shown in figure  [ flare ] .",
    "the source was in a very high state and so we observed continuously from a source zenith angle of @xmath38 down to @xmath39 .",
    "the difference between the results before and after throughput factor correction illustrates the importance of this correction when studying the detailed structure of flares .",
    "figure  [ mrk421 ] shows the correlation between x - ray and @xmath0-ray measurements both with and without a throughput correction applied to the @xmath0-ray data .",
    "the correlation , as defined by the linear correlation coefficient , @xmath40 , improves slightly when the throughput correction is applied .",
    "the correlation is not perfect ; the remaining scatter may be due to the fact that the measurements are daily average fluxes , where the x - ray and @xmath0-ray observations which have been used to calculate the averages are not exactly contemporaneous .",
    "alternatively , it may be due to the details of the @xmath0-ray production mechanism in the source .",
    "clearly though , the magnitude of the effect of the throughput correction on the measured @xmath0-ray flux shows the importance of the correction in this type of study .",
    "in this section we consider a different use of the cosmic ray background . rather than attempting to correct for temporal changes in the efficiency of a single telescope we are interested in calculating a relative calibration between the different elements of an array .",
    "the celeste experiment @xcite , situated in the french pyrenees , uses forty movable @xmath41 mirrors ( known as heliostats ) of a former solar electrical plant to reflect cherenkov light from air showers to a detector package at the top of a @xmath42 tall tower .",
    "the detector package consists of a single photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) equipped with a fast analog - to - digital converter ( fadc ) for each heliostat , providing a measure of the arrival time and photon density of the cherenkov light at ground level .",
    "this type of cherenkov wavefront sampling experiment provides a massive total mirror area which allows us to reach an energy threshold of @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the fundamental problem still exists however ; there is no test beam with which to calibrate the experiment .",
    "furthermore , in the case of a heliostat array it is necessary to calculate a relative calibration of the different heliostats which , for a solar plant experiment like celeste , will vary as the source position is tracked across the sky and the mirrors present a changing area of reflecting surface to the detector .    for each event which triggers the experiment , the luminosity @xmath1 for each heliostat",
    "is simply given by the charge measured by the single pmt .",
    "the histograms of @xmath1 can then be used to calculate a throughput factor for each heliostat in a similar fashion to that described above for the whipple telescope .",
    "the difference in this case is that the throughput factor describes the relative gains of the forty heliostats .",
    "in fact , the throughput calculation has been made in a simplified way for celeste by simply integrating the @xmath1 histograms and measuring the values of @xmath1 at two constant fraction levels ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) of the total number of events .",
    "these fractions were chosen so as to be distant from the regions of the histograms affected by saturation of the adcs at the higher end and by the trigger conditions at the lower .",
    "we then normalize the difference in @xmath1 at these two levels to provide the throughput measurement for each heliostat .",
    "if the distribution of @xmath1 is a perfect power law this method should produce identical results to the @xmath46 minimization used for the whipple telescope data .",
    "we have compared the two methods using whipple data taken over a range of elevations and find the results to be consistent to within @xmath47 .",
    "the results of this section illustrate relative changes in the heliostat response and so are not strongly affected by this discrepency .",
    "an example of the use of this measurement is shown in figure  [ celeste ] .",
    "the upper plot shows the layout of the celeste heliostat array and the tower which houses the detector package .",
    "also shown are the five groups of heliostats whose signals are summed and used to trigger the experiment and the position of the cherenkov imaging experiment , cat .",
    "the three central plots show the throughput measurements for three heliostats at different positions in the heliostat array as a function of the azimuth angle of the source in the sky .",
    "as the source moves across the sky , the heliostat efficiency changes , and this change will be greatest for heliostats which reflect the cherenkov light through the largest angle to the detector in the tower .",
    "the three plots correspond to heliostats located on the far left ( west ) , centrally and on the far right ( east ) of the array .",
    "the slope of the measured change in throughput with azimuth angle reflects these positions .",
    "this is illustrated further in the lower plot which shows the slope of the throughput change with azimuth angle as a function of the heliostat s angular position in the array defined by the angle heliostat - tower - north .",
    "a heliostat due north of the tower has an angular position of @xmath48 , while those to the east and west of the tower have positive and negative angular positions , respectively .",
    "the measured change in throughput with source position has been used to verify the simulation of the rather complex telescope optics with good results @xcite .",
    "also , the heliostat throughput factors , calculated with the heliostats observing a point due south of the experiment , have been used to calculate an adjustment to the high voltage supply of each pmt such that the relative gain after the adjustment is approximately the same for each heliostat / pmt pair .",
    "this correction smooths out the largest differences between the different groups of heliostats which are used to trigger the experiment and prevents the experiment energy threshold being defined by a few very sensitive detectors .",
    "the throughput factors have also been used to identify heliostats with erratic behaviour ; for example , heliostats with large tracking errors , which can then be repaired .",
    "we have shown that cosmic ray background events observed at fixed zenith angle can be used to establish a relative calibration for a single atmospheric cherenkov imaging telescope in order to account for the many unavoidable temporal changes in light collection efficiency , gain and , most importantly , atmospheric conditions . generalizing the method ,",
    "we have shown that it can be used for the relative calibration of data obtained at different zenith angles , taking into account both the geometrical effects due to zenith angle and the variations in atmospheric conditions .",
    "this calibration method can be used to introduce corrections at various levels . at the most basic level",
    ", it can be used to select which data were taken under good conditions .",
    "we have also shown that it can be used to rescale the measured @xmath0-ray fluxes in order to make observations taken under different conditions more comparable .",
    "one method of estimating the background due to cosmic rays for @xmath0-ray observations taken without dedicated background control observations is to choose archival background observations taken under conditions as similar as possible to the source observation being considered .",
    "the throughput factor can be used as one of the criteria to judge which background runs are most suitable @xcite .",
    "the application of the throughput calibration to celeste observations shows how useful it may be when considering telescope arrays .",
    "the next generation of cherenkov imaging telescopes are currently being developed ; the veritas @xcite , hess @xcite and cangaroo iii @xcite projects all involve using multiple telescopes on the same site .",
    "inter - calibration of these telescopes will be difficult without a dedicated test beam .",
    "for veritas , simulations indicate that an energy resolution of @xmath49 should be possible ; in practice , this will require a relative calibration accurate to @xmath50 .",
    "the throughput method described here may well prove to be the best solution",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the veritas and celeste collaborations for the use of their data .",
    "we would also like to thank philippe bruel for his help in developing the celeste calibration .",
