    "@xmath0 ``  numerical ranges and @xmath0 ''  numerical radii @xcite naturally relate to optimization problems on the unitary orbit of a given matrix .",
    "a particularly interesting class of applications concerns quantum systems as shown in more detail in the accompanying paper @xcite .",
    "this is because quantum dynamics and quantum control of closed hamiltonian systems are governed by the unitary group of the underlying hilbert space and its subgroups .",
    "for instance , in quantum information and quantum computation , where spin-@xmath9 two - level systems are exploited as elementary units  called quantum bits or qubits for short  the full dynamics of @xmath5 qubits take place on the unitary group @xmath10 .",
    "this includes two types of coherent time evolutions , ( i ) _ within _ each individual qubit independently as well as ( ii ) _ between _ coupled qubits .",
    "the former is brought about by so - called _",
    "local actions_. hence , we refer to the corresponding subgroup as the subgroup of local time evolution @xmath11 .",
    "it takes the form of an @xmath5-fold tensor product of @xmath6 with itself .",
    "clearly , matrices ( states ) that are themselves @xmath5-fold tensor - products remain in this product form under conjugation with elements of @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , quantum optimization problems which can be expressed via local actions motivate in a most natural way the study of a subset of the classical @xmath0 \"  numerical range , namely the _ local @xmath0 \"  numerical range_. it is but a special instance of the more general structure which we introduce here as the _ relative @xmath0 \"  numerical range _",
    ", where the full unitary group is restricted to some arbitrary compact connected subgroup .    to be mathematically precise , let @xmath2 denote the compact and connected lie group of all unitary matrices of size @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath13 if and only if @xmath14 with @xmath15 , where @xmath16 stands for the conjugate transpose .",
    "moreover , let @xmath17 be the subgroup of all special unitary matrices , i.e. @xmath18 if and only if @xmath13 with @xmath19 .",
    "finally , let @xmath20 be the @xmath5-fold tensor product of @xmath6 , which consists of all @xmath5-fold kronecker products of the from @xmath21 for all @xmath22 .",
    "following terminology from quantum information  as mentioned above  we refer to @xmath11 as the subgroup of _ local _ unitary transformations .",
    "now , for arbitrary complex matrices @xmath23 the _ local @xmath0 \"  numerical range _ of @xmath24 is defined as @xmath25 obviously , @xmath26 is a subset of the classical @xmath0 \"  numerical range of @xmath24 , denoted @xmath27 .",
    "however , its geometry is significantly more intricate than in the classical case and has yet not been studied in any systematic way , cf .",
    "analysing its basic properties leads naturally to the following slightly more general object @xmath28which we call the _ relative @xmath0 \"  numerical range _ of @xmath24 .",
    "here , @xmath29 may be any compact and connected subgroup of @xmath2 .",
    "clearly , @xmath1 is invariant under unitary similarities of @xmath24 and @xmath0 by elements of @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , with @xmath1 being a continuous image of @xmath29 , it is compact and connected .",
    "however , in contrast to the classical @xmath0 \"  numerical range , cf .",
    "@xcite , counterexamples show that @xmath1 is neither star - shaped nor simply connected . in general , the actual size and shape of @xmath1 are mostly unknown .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to initiate the study of the relative @xmath0 ``  numerical range and in particular its geometry . starting points for our investigations",
    "are well - known results on the classical @xmath0 ''  numerical range .",
    "therefore , we have summarized the fundamental geometric properties of @xmath27 at the beginning of section [ sec:2 ] .",
    "subsequently , the above mentioned counterexamples and straightforward consequences of ( [ def : relnumrange ] ) are collected in subsection [ subsec:2.1 ] .",
    "the main result , a generalisation on rotationally symmetric @xmath0-umerical ranges , is presented in subsection [ subsec:2.2 ] . particularly , the original work by li and tsing @xcite is recovered as a immediate corollary . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we return to local @xmath0 ``  numerical ranges . here",
    ", the central conclusion is that rotationally symmetric local @xmath0 ''  numerical ranges are essentially circular discs .",
    "finally , we illustrate the previous results by determining all complex @xmath30-matrices , the local @xmath0 \"  numerical range of which is a circular disc centered at the origin of the complex plane .",
    "these computations lead to a conjecture on unitray similarity to block - shift form of such matrices .",
    "some concluding remarks on numerical issuse and perspectives for future work can be found in section [ sec:4 ] .",
    "in section [ intro ] , we introduced the @xmath0 \"  numerical range of @xmath31 relative to a compact and connected subgroup @xmath29 of @xmath2 as follows @xmath32 for simplicity , we call @xmath33 _ the relative @xmath0 \"  numerical range _ whenever any misinterpretation is excluded .    below , we aim at a better understanding of the geometry of the relative @xmath0 ``  numerical range .",
    "in particular , we focus on geometric properties of the classical @xmath0 ''  numerical range which are preserved by passing to the relative one .",
    "for this reason , we first recall some basic facts about the classical @xmath0 \"  numerical range .",
    "let @xmath34 be any complex matrix .",
    "the classical numerical and @xmath0 \"  numerical range of @xmath35 are defined by @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively . since any unitary transformation @xmath38",
    "can be factored in the form @xmath39 with @xmath40 , the set @xmath27 does not change , if we restrict @xmath38 to @xmath17 . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath41 for some @xmath42 with @xmath43 we have @xmath44 hence @xmath27 coincides with @xmath45 , if @xmath0 is of the above form . here",
    ", we used the fact , that @xmath2 acts transitively on the unit sphere of @xmath46 .",
    "this will be of interest later on , if one wants to define a numerical range of @xmath24 relative to @xmath29 , see also section [ sec:3 ] , remark [ rem:3.1 ] .",
    "probably the most basic geometric properties of the numerical and @xmath0 ``  numerical range are compactness and connectedness , both following from the fact that @xmath45 and @xmath27 are continuous images of compact and connected sets .",
    "the first deep result on the geometry of the numerical range , its convexity , was obtained independently by hausdorff @xcite and toeplitz @xcite . for a proof in a modern textbook we refer to @xcite .",
    "later , the result was extended by westwick @xcite and poon @xcite to @xmath0 ''  numerical ranges for one of the operators @xmath24 or @xmath0 being hermitian . yet , in general @xmath0 \"  numerical ranges are non - convex except for @xmath47 , and even for normal matrices convexity may fail for @xmath48 , cf .",
    "however , by a result of cheung and tsing @xcite , they are always star - shaped with respect to the star - center @xmath49 .",
    "the above mentioned theorems describe features which are in common to all @xmath0 ``  numerical ranges .",
    "another type of results aims at characterising @xmath0 ''  numerical ranges @xmath27 of particularly simple form such as an interval or a circular disc . here",
