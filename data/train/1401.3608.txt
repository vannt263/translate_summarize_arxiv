    "unlike to nucleons , a hyperon is not pauli blocked owing to strangeness quantum number and resides at the centre of the nucleus .",
    "hyperons are used as an impurity in nuclear systems to reveal many of the nuclear properties in the dimension of strangeness  @xcite . for this",
    ", a slightly unbound normal nucleus can be bound by addition of @xmath2 particle  @xcite .    to understand the structure of strange system , it is necessary to evaluate the contribution of yn interaction .",
    "but , due to short life - time of hyperon , only limited information on yn scattering data is available which is a major consequence of the experimental difficulties  @xcite . for this purpose ,",
    "more theoretical data are needed to explore the strangeness physics .",
    "however , extensive efforts on theoretical basis have been made to enrich the knowledge about yn interaction using relativistic and non - relativistic mean field approaches .",

    "to deal with hypernuclei , one has to incorporate the meson - hyperon interaction to the relativistic lagrangian",
    ". the most successful rmf model of boguta and bodmer , included the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6mesons along with the nonlinear coupling of @xmath4meson , which simulates the three - body interaction  @xcite .",

    "@xcite .    here , we are not interested to make a new parameter by inclusion of this interaction but our motive is just to extract the contribution of @xmath0meson in hypernuclei and corresponding normal nuclei . for this",

    "it is necessary to check the reliability of the parameter which is going to be used . for this purpose",
    ", we calculate the total binding energy ( be ) , single lambda binding energy ( @xmath3 ) and radii for some selected hypernuclei whose experimental data are available . after analyzing table  [ tab1 ]",

    "it is obvious that the @xmath2 hyperon exhibits its strange behaviour and enhance the binding of nucleons in hypernucleus .",
