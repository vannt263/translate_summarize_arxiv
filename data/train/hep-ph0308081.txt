    "at this conference , the organizer asked to review on the axion  @xcite as the cdm candidate  @xcite .",
    "therefore , i will review the qcd axion and the related problem , the strong cp problem . with supersymmetrization , an o(gev ) axino can be a cdm candidate also  @xcite in addition to the axion cdm , but we will not discuss this interesting class of cdm candidate here .",
    "it was reviewed in another dm conference  @xcite . out of several cdm candidates ,",
    "the axion is most attractive since it arises from the need to solve the strong cp problem",
    ". one crucial difference of the axion cdm from most other cdm candidates is that the axion is a classical field oscillation  @xcite while many other cdm candidates rely on their heavy particle nature .",
    "the classical axion potential is extremely flat as shown in fig .",
    "1 . the axion value @xmath0 stays at some point(the bullet ) for a long time before it starts to oscillates , which occurs at @xmath1 1  gev when the hubble time @xmath2 becomes larger than the oscillation period @xmath3 .",

    "the   parameter is the final low energy value , taking into account the weak cp violation .",
    "it can be split into two pieces = +  where  is the parameter determined at high energy scale and @xmath10 is the one generated at the electroweak scale .",
    "since  contributes to the neutron electric dipole moment(nedm ) , the experimental upper bound on nedm constrains @xmath11 , which is a fine - tuning problem : the so - called _ strong cp problem_.    one may argue that there is no strong cp problem from the beginning .",
    "one such argument is a 5d extension where there is no 5d instanton solution  @xcite .",
    "however , i think that in the 4d effective theory language where 5d is hidden one should consider the @xmath12 term at low energy , and the strong cp problem reappears .",
    "so , in this talk i will review the solutions of the strong cp problem first on ,    * the calculable , * the massless up quark solution , and * the very light axion ,    and then go on to discuss an axion - like particle ,    * the quintessential axion  @xcite .",

    "is supposed to be zero , which can be implemented by assuming the cp invariance of the lagrangian .",
    "thus , the weak cp violation can be introduced only spontaneously  @xcite .",
    "after the weak cp violation is introduced spontaneously ,  can be calculated . in the beginning , this kind of models were proposed by changing the weak interactions  @xcite .",
    "however , the kobayashi - maskawa(km ) type weak cp violation seems to be working , and the above spontaneous weak cp violations are not working . in this",
    "regards , the nelson - barr approach  @xcite of the spontaneous cp violation at a very high energy scale with a calculable   has attracted a great deal of attention since at low energy it leads to the km type weak cp violation .",
    "however , it needs superheavy particles with a vectorlike representation at high energy scale .",
    "suppose that we chiral - transform a quark field @xmath13 , @xmath14 it is equivalent to changing @xmath15@xmath16 .",
    "thus , if a theory admits such a transformation , i.e. if there exists a massless quark , then the strong cp problem is not present .",
    "the up quark is most promising for the massless quark possibility .",
    "it was known from the very early days of the  vacuum that a massless up quark solves the strong cp problem .",

    "leutwyler  @xcite attempted to compute @xmath32 using the qcd sum rule with the @xmath40(the su(3 ) singlet meson ) dominance , in analogy with the vector dominance model , and obtained @xmath41 .",
    "if leutwyler s calculation is correct , the @xmath18 possibility is ruled out .",
    "however , there are arguments con leutwyler . for example",
    ", the @xmath40 dominance can be questioned . to answer this problem ,",
    "choi  @xcite followed the modern interpretation for the @xmath40 mass , i.e. the instanton contribution to the @xmath40 mass , in which case he showed that he could change the sign of @xmath32 , to @xmath42 .",
    "choi s result is obtained by semiclassical approximation supplemented by gluon condensate which may be the only unreliable point .",
    "anyway , it was noted that instanton effects suppress @xmath40 contribution to @xmath32 .",
    "so , it is fair to say that the problem is not completely settled in the chiral perturbation theory .    there has been a new development in the lattice calculation of the chiral perturbation parameter .",
    "for example , a lattice calculation  @xcite gives  @xcite @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "if it is true , the @xmath18 possibility is closed .",
    "however , there can be questions on the lattice calculation such as the small number of lattice sites and no inclusion of the instanton effects .",
    "anyway , the possibility of @xmath18 is raised from the instanton contribution to the up quark mass .",
    "therefore , it is fair to say that the @xmath18 possibility is not closed yet from lattice calculation .",
    "axion was noted  @xcite from the spontaneously broken peccei - quinn symmetry  @xcite .",

    "this has led to the invention of the invisible axions  @xcite , but it is proper to call them as very light axions since in the sikivie type cavity experiments  @xcite one may detect the galactic axions .",

    "+ the above laboratory experiments restrict the decay constant of the very light axion to @xmath69 however , the laboratory bound is not as strong as the supernova bound which is discussed in the following section .",
    "a stringent lower bound on the axion decay constant comes from the study of stellar objects such as sun , red giant stars , and supernovae  @xcite .    in the hot plasma in stars , there exist high energy particles : @xmath70 , and even gluons and quarks if the interior temperature is high enough .",
    "the hot plasma of the interior of stars , even axions can be produced .",
    "but the axion interaction rate is suppressed by @xmath47 . bigger stars seemed to give stronger constraint . for example",
    ", the red giant gave a stronger constraint than sun , and the supernovae gave even more stronger constraint than red giant stars  @xcite .",
    "even before the discovery of sn1987a , there was a prophetic paper on supernovae by iwamoto  @xcite , and furthermore most stars are surveyed by pantziris and kang  @xcite . in this study ,",
    "the red giant constraint was the strongest , giving a bound @xmath71  gev .",
    "unfortunately , pantziris and kang did not give a useful bound from supernovae , presumably from the ill - treated pion - nucleon couplings .",
    "the lucky observation of sn1987a gave the strongest lower limit on @xmath47 , @xmath72  gev  @xcite .",
    "in the actual calculation , a correct treatment of the interactions is needed .",
    "for example , for the pion - nucleon coupling one can use pseudo - vector derivative couplings and pseudo - scalar couplings .",

    "the oscillation of this axionic string can be damped by creating axions .",
    "this was used to restrict the bound on @xmath47  @xcite , to less than @xmath77  gev .",
    "another interesting object created by axion background is the axionic domain walls  @xcite , which can be problematic in the standard big bang cosmology .",

    "supersymmetry seems to be the most popular extension beyond the standard model , and the inflationary idea seems to be needed for the flatness and homogeneity problems . in this case , the gravitino cosmology is inescapable and the reheating temperature after inflation is better to be less than @xmath75  gev  @xcite .",

    "1 . the axion vacuum starts to oscillate when the hubble expansion rate(@xmath2 ) became small enough to be comparable as the classical axion oscillation rate(@xmath103 ) , which happens when the temperature of the universe falls to around @xmath104  gev  @xcite .",

    "4 , we summarize the current status of the axion search experiments .",
    "there are two points to be clarified here .",
    "one is that there are many very light axion models , in ksvz type and in dfsz type .",
    "the definition of the notation is given in kim  @xcite .",
    "for example , an arbitrary choice of @xmath79 can not fulfil the unification of couplings , and hence should not be considered toward unification of elementary particle forces  @xcite .",
    "another point is that these estimates are based on closing the universe by axions .",
    "if it is required that only 25% of the critical energy is closed by the axions , the constraint on the axion density is strengthened by a factor of 4 .",
    "it is noted that still there is a lot of room to allow the very light axion as cdm .",
    "typa 1a supernova data and wmap data hints that 73% of the energy of the universe is homogeneous dark energy  @xcite , and hence does not contribute the galaxy formation unlike the cdm candidates . in this section , we try to introduce an axionlike particle for the dark energy , which is called a quintessential axion or quintaxion . as this name suggest quintaxion is a kind of pseudo goldstone boson whose potential arises from instanton effects .",
    "this kind of extremely light ( @xmath117  ev ) pseudo - goldstone boson was suggested sometime ago  @xcite .",
    "the attempt to incoorporate it in superstring or m - theory was also tried  @xcite .",
    "there have been another kind of scalars whose present vacuum energy is required to be @xmath118 , which are generally called quintessence  @xcite .",

    "1 , it is very tempting to use some kind of almost massless quarks for the extremely flat quintessential potential . since a hidden sector is needed for supersymmetry breaking , we will attempt the hidden - sector quarks(h - quarks ) as fulfilling this purpose . before presenting a quintaxion along this line ,",
    "let me comment a few words on the superstring axion .    among several possibilities of the qcd axion given in table 1",
    ", the superstring axion seems to be the most attractive realization .",
    "the axion is definitely the most attractive solution of the strong cp problem , because it arises by automatically solving the strong cp problem .",
    "it relies only on the @xmath127 coupling . on the other hand",
    ", the other solutions should massage the theory much , by postulating specific forms of couplings .",
    "for example , @xmath18 possibility is not that simple theoretically .",
    "it requires that det .",
    "@xmath128 , which is a highly nontrivial requirement for the nine complex entries of @xmath129 .",
    "similarly , superstring axions is the most attractive since all string compactifications render a plenty of axions . for the other axions , one massage",
    "the theory more compared to the string axions . in this regards , if the model - independent axion were acceptable as the qcd axion , then it might have given a very reliable axion candidate .",
    "however , the model - independent axion failed miserably because of a too large axion decay constant  @xcite .",
    "so , as the first principle the string axion as the qcd axion failed . one must remove this model - independent axion at high energy .",
    "indeed , it is possible to do so , if there exists the anomalous @xmath76 gauge symmetry so that the @xmath76 gauge boson eats up the model - independent axion as its longitudinal degree  @xcite .",
    "but , then there must survive a global symmetry which must be broken at the intermediate scale  @xcite . in another context",
    ", some discrete symmetries were invoked to obtain an approximate global symmetry , approximate in the sense that the global symmetry breaking operators are allowed at dimension 13 and higher  @xcite . in these cases",
    ", string models can allow a qcd axion .    here , we are interested in obtaining the qcd axion also together with a quintaxion in string inspired models  @xcite .",
    "we are arrived at this kind of scenario from old solutions of the @xmath130 problem  @xcite through the composite qcd axion  @xcite .",
    "the superstring axions couples to both the qcd anomaly and the hidden sector anomaly . in this case , we must consider two @xmath116 angles , @xmath131 and @xmath132 . to have the vacuum at @xmath133 , we need two axions . here , we want to introduce two such axions as the composite one from the hidden - sector squark condensation and a superstring axion . in this case",
