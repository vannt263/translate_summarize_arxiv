    "the accurate determination of the distances to local group galaxies is critical in the study of the extragalactic distance scale .",
    "in particular two spiral galaxies in the local group , m31 and m33 , are primary calibrators for several secondary distance indicators including the tully - fisher relation .",
    "while the distance to m31 has been measured extensively , relatively less attention has been paid to the distance determination of m33 @xcite .",
    "recently the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) , a population ii distance indicator , has frequently been used for the determination of distances to resolved galaxies in the local group ; in addition , another population ii distance indicator , the red clump ( rc ) , has come to be used quite often as well .",
    "these two methods have an advantage over the classical primary distance indicators such as cepheids and rr lyraes in that the distances to galaxies can be determined reliably from single epoch observations .",
    "the trgb has been known to be an excellent standard candle for resolved galaxies , because the @xmath11-band magnitude of the trgb for stars older than a few gyrs with metallicity @xmath12\\le-0.7 $ ] is essentially independent of age and metallicity @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the rc was not widely recognized as a potentially good standard candle until @xcite recently suggested its use . since then the reliability of the rc as a standard candle has been controversial ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "@xcite showed that the mean @xmath11-band magnitude @xmath13 of red clump stars is independent of their color in the range @xmath14 and has a small dispersion(@xmath15 mag ) , suggesting that the rc can be a good standard candle as originally pointed out by @xcite .",
    "however , the distance to the large magellanic cloud obtained using the rc by @xcite and @xcite was much shorter than that based on other methods , which became a starting point for debate focused on the accuracy of the rc method .",
    "@xcite claimed that the @xmath13 has a weak dependence on metallicity and no dependence on age for an intermediate age population ( 210 gyrs ) of stars . on the contrary",
    ", @xcite analyzed several galactic open clusters with intermediate - ages and compared the properties of their rcs with the predictions of stellar evolution models ; this comparison indicates that the @xmath13 becomes significantly fainter as the cluster gets older .",
    "in addition , a number of studies have argued that stellar evolutionary theory predicts a significant dependence of @xmath13 on the combination of the age and metallicity of the stellar population @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the input physics and the dependence of various evolutionary codes should be considered to clarify this discrepancy .",
    "observationally it is also important to attack this problem by investigating the effect of age and metallicity on the rc in other nearby galaxies where the properties of the rc can be studied in detail .    in this paper",
    "we present an analysis designed to determine the distance to m33 using the trgb and the rc based on photometry of stars in ten m33 fields obtained from @xmath1 images .",
    "m33 is an ideal target to apply both the trgb and rc methods of distance determination using @xmath1 data .",
    "this paper is composed as follows . in ",
    "2 we present the data and reduction technique .  3 displays the color - magnitude diagrams of the measured stars , and estimates the distance to m33 using the trgb and rc methods .",
    "primary results are discussed in  4 and are summarized in  5 .",
    "we have analyzed @xmath1 data for ten fields in m33 obtained for @xcite s cycle 5 program ( go-5914 ) .",
    "each field was observed for four orbits , yielding a total exposure time of 4800 seconds for @xmath16 and 5200 seconds for @xmath17 .",
    "these data were obtained originally for the study of globular clusters in m33 , and a globular cluster is centered in each pc chip .",
    "the data from the pc chip were presented by @xcite and @xcite . in this study",
    "we use all field stars in the wf2 , wf3 , and wf4 chips as well as in the pc chip .",
    "hereafter we refer to each observed region using the globular cluster s designation .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the location of the regions in m33 used in this study .",
    "considering the number of fields and the deep exposures , these data are ideal for studying the field stars as well as the globular clusters in m33 .",
    "table 1 lists the positions , galactocentric distances , deprojected radial distances , and the reddening values of all the regions used in this study .",
    "the position of the region in table 1 is the center of the wfpc2 .",
    "the galactocentric distance is the distance from the center of m33 ( ra(2000 ) = 01@xmath1833@xmath1951@xmath20.02 , dec(2000 ) = + 30@xmath2139@xmath2236@xmath23.7 ) @xcite .",
    "all the regions were assumed to be in the plane of m33 s disk and were deprojected to estimate the actual radial distance .",
    "an inclination of @xmath24 and a position angle of @xmath25 for m33 were used for deprojection of the positions @xcite . for foreground",
    "reddening correction , the cobe / iras extinction maps of @xcite are used .",
    "the reddening values of all the regions are as low as @xmath26 ( @xmath3 ) . the extinction laws for @xmath273.3 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite ,",
    "are adopted in this study .",
    "the photometry of the stars in the ccd images has been obtained using the _ multiphot _ routine of the hstphot package @xcite .",
    "the hstphot package was designed for photometry of @xmath1 data and employs a library of tiny tim point - spread - functions ( psfs ) for psf fitting to account for variations in the psf due to location on the chip and the centering within a pixel .",
    "after psf - fitting , corrections are also made for geometric distortion , cte effect , and the 34@xmath30 row effect @xcite .",
    "the _ multiphot _",
    "routine gives the magnitudes transformed to the standard system as well as instrumental magnitudes .",
    "the hstphot photometry used zero points from @xcite which provides corrections to the @xcite values .",
    "the number of the measured stars in each region is many tens of thousands ( from @xmath31 to @xmath32 stars ) which are too many to plot in a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "therefore , as an example , fig .",
    "2 shows the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for one field . in the case of the pc chip , at the center of which",
    "a globular cluster is located , the stars at @xmath33 arcsec from the center of the cluster are considered to be members while those at @xmath34 arcsec are considered to be field stars .",
    "figure 2 shows a cmd for the measured stars in the c20-region , which happens to be our most distant field from the center of m33 .",
    "several features are seen in figure 2 .",
    "( a ) there is a broad red giant branch ( rgb ) , the tip of which is seen at @xmath35 mag .",
    "the mean color of the rgb of these field stars is redder than that of the globular cluster c20 in the same region ( represented by the solid line ) .",
    "the locus of c20 was derived from the median color of the stars at @xmath33 arcsec from the center of c20 .",
    "( b ) a red clump is distinctively seen at @xmath36 mag and @xmath37 ; ( c ) asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars are also seen along and above the rgb ; and ( d ) there is a blue plume at @xmath38 extending up to @xmath39 mag , which consists of massive main sequence stars and evolved supergiants .",
    "these features are also seen in the cmds of the other regions .    in figure 3 ,",
    "the cmds of all the regions are shown in number density contour maps ( hess diagrams ) .",
    "the density contour maps are constructed on @xmath40 grids in the cmd domain ( the size of each grid is @xmath41 ) , and are smoothed using gaussian filters of @xmath42 grid width .",
    "basic features seen in figure 3 are similar to those in figure 2 .",
    "number density contour maps are useful for revealing the areas with the highest stellar density .",
    "all cmds in figure 3 show a strong peak at the position of the red clump ( marked by the crosses ) .",
    "the photometry of the stars in the r14- and r12-regions is significantly affected by crowding , because they are located close to the center of m33 .",
    "therefore only the stars in the pc chip ( which has higher spatial resolution than the wf chips ) are used to measure the magnitude of the red clump in these regions in the following .        we have determined the distance to m33 using the @xmath11-band magnitude of the trgb , following the description given in @xcite .",
    "figure 4 displays the @xmath11-band luminosity functions of red stars including the rgb and agb stars . in figure 4",
    "there is a sudden increase at @xmath43 in all the regions as marked by the arrow , which corresponds to the trgb .",
    "we have measured the @xmath11-band magnitude of the trgb using this feature in the luminosity function by eye detection ( supplemented by using the edge - detection filters @xcite ) .",
    "the values of the @xmath44 thus derived for all the regions are listed in table 2 .",
    "the distance modulus is given by    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the dereddened @xmath11-band magnitude of the trgb .",
    "@xmath47 is the bolometric correction to the i magnitude which depends on color as follows : @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the dereddened color of the trgb .",
    "the bolometric magnitude of the trgb , @xmath50 , is given as a function of metallicity [ fe / h ] by :    @xmath51 -3.81.\\ ] ]    metallicity can be estimated from the @xmath52 color at the absolute @xmath11-band magnitude of @xmath53 given by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) as follows :    @xmath54 = -12.64 + 12.6(v - i)_{0 , -3.5 } -3.3(v - i)^2_{0 , -3.5}.\\ ] ]    we have employed an iterative procedure in which an initial guess at the distance is used to estimate the metallicity which is in turn used to refine the distance until the solution converges , which occurs after only a few iterations .",
    "it is important to note that the regions used for this study are located in various environments including young to old stellar populations ; thus , the broad rgbs seen in the cmds are actually a mixture of intermediate - age to old populations , as well as a range of metallicities .",
    "if we simply use the mean color [ @xmath55 of the entire apparent rgb in this case , the resulting metallicity will be an underestimate , because there are younger populations with bluer color on the blue side of the rgb .",
    "for this reason we tried to use the median value of the color of the stars along the rgb to reduce the effect of intermediate - age populations . as a check of our method ,",
    "we have also derived the mean metallicity using the slope of the rgb as calibrated by @xcite , obtaining very similar results to those from the median color of the rgb stars .",
    "the mean metallicities resulting from this procedure are listed in table 2 .",
    "the mean metallicity ranges from [ fe / h ] @xmath56 0.6 to 0.9 dex .",
    "figure 5 displays the mean metallicity versus the deprojected radial distance of the regions ( filled circles ) . in figure 5",
    "there is clearly a negative radial gradient of the metallicity .",
    "the mean metallicity data are fit by [ fe / h ] @xmath57 r_{dp } - 0.55[\\pm0.02]$ ] ( [ fe / h ] @xmath58 r_{dp } - 0.51[\\pm0.06]$ ] , using the metallicity obtained with the rgb slope method ) for all the data , where @xmath59 is given in terms of kpc ( @xmath60 kpc is assumed ) .",
    "if we exclude the two innermost regions where the crowding is severe , we obtain a fit , [ fe / h ] @xmath61 r_{dp } - 0.48[\\pm0.04]$ ] ( [ fe / h ] @xmath62 r_{dp } - 0.34[\\pm0.10]$ ] using the metallicity obtained with the rgb slope method ) , similar to values found in our galaxy s disk using open clusters and field giants ( @xmath63/dr = - 0.050 \\pm 0.008 $ ] kpc@xmath64 ) @xcite . in figure 5 the metallicity of the red giants is compared with that of hii regions in m33 .",
    "the metallicity of the hii regions was converted from [ o / h ] values given in the literature @xcite using the following relation taken from @xcite : @xmath65=-0.184[fe / h]+0.019 $ ] .",
    "the deprojected radius for the hii regions was calculated as above .",
    "the metallicity of the hii regions is fit by [ fe / h ] @xmath66 r_{dp } + 0.33[\\pm0.07]$ ] , which is somewhat steeper than that for the field red giants .",
    "the relation for the hii regions shows a trend that is similar to that of the field red giants , but with a larger scatter .",
    "it is natural that the mean metallicity of the field red giants is lower than that of the hii regions , because the red giants are much older than the hii regions .",
    "then we derive the distance modulus of each region using the information given above .",
    "table 2 lists the parameters related to the trgb method ; the observed @xmath11-band magnitude of the trgb ( @xmath44 ) , the extinction corrected @xmath11-band magnitude of the trgb ( @xmath67 ) , the mean color of the trgb [ @xmath68 , the mean color measured at @xmath53 [ @xmath55 , the mean metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) of the rgb , the absolute magnitude of the trgb ( @xmath69 ) , and the distance modulus [ @xmath70 .",
    "figure 6 displays @xmath44 versus [ fe / h ] for the ten regions in m33 .",
    "the value of @xmath44 varies little , with no obvious net metallicity dependence .",
    "the mean value of @xmath44 for the ten regions is @xmath71 , showing a remarkably small dispersion .",
    "the average value of the distance moduli for all of the fields is calculated to be @xmath72(random)@xmath5(systematic ) .",
    "the errors for the distance modulus are based on the error budget listed in table 3 .",
    "the calibration of the trgb is based on galactic globular clusters with [ fe / h ] = 2.1 to 0.7 dex , yet the derived mean metallicities of the four inner regions in our sample ( [ fe / h ] = 0.61 to 0.68 dex ) are slightly larger than the upper boundary of the calibration range .",
    "if we use only the six other regions , excluding these four inner ones , we obtain an average distance modulus of @xmath73(random)@xmath5(systematic ) .",
    "if the theoretical calibration given by @xcite is adopted ( @xmath74 + 0.147[m / h]^2 $ ] and @xmath75=-39.270 + 64.687[(v - i)_{0,-3.5 } ] -36.351[(v - i)_{0,-3.5}]^2   + 6.838 [ ( v - i)_{0,-3.5}]^3 $ ] ) , the average distance modulus will be @xmath76(statistical ) , which is 0.2 mag fainter than that derived using the empirical calibration of @xcite .",
    "however , it has been found that the distance obtained with the theoretical calibration is not consistent with other results as shown by @xcite in ic 1613 .",
    "so we prefer to use the empirical calibration rather than the theoretical one in this study .",
    "finally we adopt @xmath72(random)@xmath5(systematic ) as the trgb distance modulus to m33 .",
    "we have determined the distance to m33 using the red clump as well .",
    "red clumps are clearly found in the cmds of all the regions , as seen in figure 3 .",
    "it is important to note that implicit in the subsequent analysis is the assumption that the metallicity determined from the rgb stars can be applied to the red clump stars as well .",
    "this is based on two assertions .",
    "first , based on the absence of a vertical structure of stars blueward of the rc @xcite , we claim that the age of the rc stars is likely to be older than @xmath771 gyr .",
    "second , the chemical enrichment in the disk of m33 is assumed to have been small in the period between 10 gyr and a few gyr ago .    to check the variation of the mean magnitude of the red clump on the color , we have selected red clump stars with colors and magnitudes in the range @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "figure 7 displays the mean magnitude of these stars ( @xmath80 ) versus their @xmath52 colors .",
    "the horizontal bars on the filled circles represent the size of the color bin .",
    "two thousand stars are included in each color bin .",
    "figure 7 shows that the variation of the mean magnitudes for the color range of @xmath81 in a given region ( the same range as used for m31 by @xcite ) is smaller than 0.1 mag in all of the regions ; fig .",
    "7 also indicates that the variation of the mean magnitudes among the regions is remarkably small ( less than 0.1 mag ) .",
    "it is rather surprising that the variation of the mean magnitudes of the rc is smaller than 0.1 mag , considering that the regions used are located at a large range of distances from the center of m33 with diverse star formation histories and a varying metallicity .",
    "however , we note that the metal abundances vary over a range of less than 0.3 dex .",
    "such a small abundance range has a correspondingly small effect on the i - band rc luminosity ( less than 0.04 mag)@xcite .",
    "the rc is also sensitive to age , which further suggests that the dominant stellar populations in our m33 disk fields are all probably similar in age . in uniform populations such as this ,",
    "the red clump can potentially be a good standard candle .",
    "we derive then the @xmath11-band luminosity functions of these red clump stars with @xmath81 , as displayed in figure 8 .",
    "figure 8 shows that there is a strong single peak above the slowly varying background in the @xmath11-band luminosity functions in all the regions .",
    "we measure the peak magnitude of the red clumps fitting the @xmath11-band luminosity functions with the combination of a gaussian function ( for the red clump ) and a parabolic function ( for the red giants and subgiants ) as follows @xcite :    @xmath82 } } .\\ ] ]    figure 8 shows that the data for the @xmath11-band luminosity functions are well fit by the equations ( the solid lines ) , and the fitting parameters thus derived are listed in table 4 . for the r14 and r12 regions in figure 8 ,",
    "in which only the stars in the pc chip are used because of crowding , the luminosity functions are arbitrarily multiplied by a factor of 5 for plotting . remarkably , the peak magnitudes of the red clumps of all the regions turn out to be within a very narrow range from @xmath83 to 24.57 .    then we need to know the absolute magnitude of the red clump to derive the distance modulus .",
    "calibration of the absolute magnitude of the red clump is a matter of considerable debate ( see @xcite and references therein ) . as a result",
    ", the calibrations of the relation between the @xmath11-band magnitude and metallicity of the red clump continue to change .",
    "in fact , these relations should include the effects of age , but rarely do because of the difficulty in estimating the ages of individual field stars .",
    "two of the most recent empirical calibrations are    @xmath84[fe / h]-0.23[\\pm0.03]\\ ] ]    given by @xcite with the metallicity range of @xmath85\\leq0.0 $ ] , and    @xmath86[fe / h]-0.23[\\pm0.02].\\ ] ]    given by @xcite with the metallicity range of @xmath87\\leq0.05 $ ] .    assuming that the mean metallicity of the red clump in all the regions in our study is similar to that of the red giants and that the eqs.(6 ) and ( 7 ) are universal",
    ", we derive the distance to m33 using the above calibrations .",
    "the results thus obtained are summarized in table 4 .",

    "we have investigated the relations between these parameters in figure 9 wherein ( a ) illustrates the mean color of the red clump stars as a function of [ fe / h ] .",

    "@xmath89 is almost constant at @xmath93 for [ fe / h ] @xmath94 dex , and increases significantly for [ fe / h ] @xmath95 dex .",
