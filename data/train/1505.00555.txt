    "grover s algorithm demostrates that in the quantum model searching can be done faster than classical computation ; in fact its time complexity @xmath186 is asymptotically the fastest possible for searching an unsorted database in the linear quantum model .",
    "however , it only provides a quadratic speedup rather than exponential speedup over their classical counterparts .",

    ", the classical fields of state @xmath188 pass through a gate array as shown in fig",
    "then we obtain the mode status matrix by using the quadrature demodulation : @xmath198finally , it is easy to search only corresponding sequence permutation @xmath199 . if we choose @xmath200 , we can obtain the mode status matrix @xmath201 in the mode status matrix , we can not search any corresponding sequence permutation",
