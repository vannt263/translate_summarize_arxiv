    "current sheets are generically unstable to resistive reconnecting instabilities , the archetype of which is the tearing mode  @xcite . in the tearing mode instability",
    "the fastest growing perturbations have wavelengths along the current sheet which are much greater than the thickness of the sheet itself , identified with the shear scale - length of the equilibrium magnetic field .",
    "magnetic islands develop in a small region around the neutral line ( or , more generally , for a current sheet with a non - vanishing axial field , on surfaces where the wave vector is such that @xmath5 ) and grow on time scales intermediate between the diffusion time scale of the equilibrium and the alfvn time scale as measured on the current sheet thickness .",
    "though the tearing mode has been studied extensively over the past decades , its role in triggering fast magnetic energy release and current sheet disruption has attracted recent research focusing on the stability of thin current sheets , starting from the sweet - parker steady state reconnecting configuration ( which is found to be unstable to the plasmoid instability  @xcite ) , and on the role of kinetic effects in speeding up reconnection compared to the slow growth rates originally found in  @xcite .",
    "it was recently suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that the use of the sweet - parker current sheet as potential initial configuration leading to fast instability was misleading in the limit of very large lundquist numbers , because of the fast plasmoid instability whose growth rate diverges as the lundquist number , based on the macroscopic scale , tends to infinity . in that paper",
    "it was shown that a current sheet with a limiting aspect ratio much smaller than that of the sweet - parker sheet , scaling as @xmath6 ( @xmath0 being the lundquist number ) , separates slowly growing resistively reconnecting sheets from those exhibiting fast plasmoid instabilities , and that this provides the proper convergence properties to ideal mhd , which is a singular limit of the resistive mhd equations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the tearing mode instability is studied for a family of current sheets with aspect ratios scaling as @xmath7 .",
    "interestingly , if @xmath8 , the sweet - parker value , static equilibria may be constructed that do not diffuse , while flows in the sweet - parker model are required , as the current sheet would otherwise diffuse on an ideal time - scale based on the macroscopic current sheet length .",
    "@xcite find that as @xmath9 from below , the growth rate becomes independent of @xmath0 itself , reaching a value of order unity . as such , that aspect ratio provides a physical upper limit to current sheet aspect ratios that may form naturally in plasmas .",
    "otherwise , at large @xmath0 , the instability time - scale would become faster than the time required to set - up the equilibrium in the first place .",
    "the linear study of reconnection instabilities as described above is intended as a useful schematization to inspect the local evolution of quasi singular current layers which , in fact , naturally form when embedded in a far richer and dynamical context such as , for example , in the field line - tangling of the parker nanoflare model of coronal heating  @xcite , or the propagation of waves around x - points or along separatrix surfaces in 3d fields , e.g. , at the boundaries of closed and open fields in the so - called streamer and pseudo - streamer configurations in the solar corona .    therefore , the question arises as to which other effects limit the aspect ratios of current sheets that can be formed before they disrupt on ideal time scales .",
    "also , given the extremely large aspect ratios of ideally  reconnecting current sheets , microscopic processes , such as two - fluid and kinetic effects , might be fundamental in the initial stages of the fast current disruption  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on the effects of viscosity in determining limiting values for current sheet dimensions , i.e. , in determining at which aspect ratios the growth rate of reconnection instabilities reaches ideal values assuming a scaling of the aspect ratio with the macroscopic lundquist and prandtl number . in the magnetized limit",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 being the ion ( electron ) larmor frequency and collision time , respectively , there are two different viscous transport coefficients of the plasma , along the direction parallel and perpendicular to the mean magnetic field  @xcite . indicating with @xmath13 and @xmath14 perpendicular and parallel ( ion ) kinematic viscosity , and with @xmath15 the parallel magnetic diffusivity , the prandtl numbers are given by @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the ratio of ion thermal pressure to magnetic pressure , @xmath19 the number density , and @xmath20 are the ion and electron temperatures , respectively . as a consequence , in many astrophysical environments",
    "the prandtl number may range from small values to values of order one or larger  @xcite : in table  [ table1 ] we list for reference some examples of magnetized plasmas that can be found in space , and their order of magnitude parameters .",
    "it is therefore of interest to study viscous effects on the stability of thin current sheets over a broad range of prandtl numbers .",
    "we will begin in section  [ uno ] by introducing the basic set of equations describing the tearing mode and by clarifying the notation used throughout the paper .",
    "section  [ classic ] and  [ para ] follow with a detailed description of the classic  visco - resistive tearing instability ( i.e. , current sheets of a given thickness ) , providing a unified framework summarizing previous results scattered in the literature and setting the stage for the subsequent focus on the scalings of growth rates and singular layer thickness with lundquist and prandtl ( or magnetic reynolds ) numbers for arbitrary aspect ratios .",
    "the latter are discussed in section  [ collapsing ] , where we also consider the possible consequences of the onset of reconnection at high prandtl numbers .",
    "conclusions are in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "we consider the visco - resistive tearing instability of a current sheet within the framework of incompressible mhd . in general ,",
    "viscous forces in a magnetized plasma are described by the divergence of a stress tensor which involves both the parallel and perpendicular viscous coefficients @xmath13 and @xmath14  @xcite . moreover",
    ", the complete stress tensor contains also non - dissipative finite larmor radius terms , sometimes called _ gyroviscosity _ terms , proportional to @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "we will neglect them here , with the reminder that in future generalizations to kinetic reconnection regimes gyroviscosity must be taken into account .",
    "we schematize the current sheet with a sheared magnetic field @xmath22 in slab geometry , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is its width , and we assume a uniform mass density @xmath25 .",
    "the gradient of the magnetic pressure may be balanced either by a pressure gradient or by an inhomogeneous component of the guide field , along the @xmath26 axis , which may vary in such a way as to maintain a force - free configuration .",
    "the resulting set of incompressible mhd equations for a 2d geometry in the limit of strong guide field is    @xmath27    @xmath28    [ strong ]    where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the plasma velocity and magnetic field . in the opposite limit of weak guide field",

    "we will discuss in section  [ para ] some of the effects of large parallel viscosity , and in which limit the set of equations  ( [ strong ] ) may approximate equations  ( [ weak ] ) .",
    "we introduce in the equations to be discussed below a macroscopic length scale @xmath33  @xcite which represents the relevant spatial scale of the system , e.g. , the length of the sheet , with respect to which we define the three time scales of the system : the ideal alfvn ( @xmath34 ) , the diffusive ( @xmath35 ) , and the resistive ( @xmath36 ) time scale , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the alfvn speed . following the usual notation ,",
    "we have introduced the lundquist number @xmath0 , and we labeled the kinematic reynolds number ( defined using the alfvn velocity ) with @xmath39 .    for the sake of clarity , we will refer throughout the text to the classic  tearing instability when time scales are measured with respect to the shear length @xmath24 , which is achieved by setting @xmath40 .    by assuming that small perturbations are functions of the form @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 being the wave vector and growth rate of a given mode , respectively , linearization of the parent system of equations around the prescribed equilibrium leads to two coupled equations for the ( normalized ) velocity and magnetic field perturbations @xmath44 and @xmath45 : @xmath46\\\\ & + r^{-1}[(\\hat u^{\\text{\\sc iv}}-\\hat",

    "magnetic fields are normalized to @xmath50 , thus @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and the normalized velocity is @xmath53 .",
    "there are a number of previous studies analyzing the effect of viscosity on classic  tearing modes .",
    "while exact solutions to equations  ( [ mom])([fara ] ) could not be found , approximated solutions in the constant-@xmath54 and non constant-@xmath54 ( resistive internal kink ) regimes  @xcite , showed that even a moderate value of the viscosity has non negligible effects .",
    "in particular , viscosity becomes more important for increasing wave vectors , towards marginal stability ( @xmath55 ) : as is intuitive , viscosity , on the one hand tends to slow down the instability with respect to the inviscid case , and , on the other hand , it prevents the reconnective layer @xmath56 from shrinking indefinitely as marginal stability is approached , @xmath57 ( or , for our equilibrium , @xmath58 )  @xcite .",
    "@xcite provides the most interesting and relevant results concerning visco - resistive tearing .",
    "he shows that the growth rate scales as @xmath59 in the constant-@xmath54 regime , and @xmath60 in the non constant-@xmath54 one , whereas the inner reconnective layer scales as @xmath61 in both regimes .",
    "in addition , both analytical and numerical calculations confirmed that viscosity removes the singularity at @xmath55 and allows for the existence of non - singular marginal modes at finite values of @xmath62 ( i.e. , @xmath63 ) .    in the next section",
    "we carry out a more comprehensive analysis in parameter space , and we consider asymptotic scalings with @xmath0 and  @xmath39 .",
    "in this section we describe our main numerical results on the classic  viscoresistive tearing instability , where , following the historical approach , the time scales @xmath34 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 are defined via the shear length @xmath24 .",
    "equations  ( [ mom])([fara ] )  have been integrated numerically with an adaptive finite difference scheme , based on newton iteration , which was designed by lentini and pereira in the seventies to solve two - point boundary value problems for systems of ode  @xcite .",
    "the maximum absolute error on the solution is specified and the boundary layer structure of the solution is solved by increasing the mesh points in that region .",
    "this method has become a standard numerical technique supplementing the asymptotic analysis for linear plasma stability problems ( see e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "we integrated the eigenmode equations for a given wavevector @xmath66 by imposing at the boundaries to the left and to the right of the magnetic neutral line where both viscosity and resistivity can be neglected , the outer layer solution of the tearing mode which goes to zero for @xmath67  @xcite .",

    "the prandtl number @xmath68 is allowed to vary from high values , @xmath69 , all the way down to @xmath70 , by changing either the lundquist number @xmath0 at fixed reynolds number @xmath39 or , vice - versa , by varying @xmath39 at fixed @xmath0 .",

    "it can be seen that a small , but finite , viscosity affects modes with relatively large wave vectors , about @xmath78 : the growth rate is reduced and , as will be discussed below , there exists a critical wave vector @xmath79 above which the equilibrium is stable ( @xmath80 ) . on the contrary ,",

    "almost all the curves have a slope equal to @xmath166 , with the exception of those points at very large @xmath71 and narrow aspect ratio .",

    "for the sake of completeness , we show also in light blue circles the growth rates obtained from equations  ( [ mompara])([farapara ] ) with parameters relevant to the solar corona and solar flares , @xmath135 and @xmath136 . growth rates at values of @xmath69 are instead appropriate for the solar wind , and the interstellar and intracluster medium ( cfr .  table  [ table1 ] ) .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ ga ] , and as can be seen by inspection of equation  ( [ scaling ] ) , ideal growth rates can now be reached for much larger aspect ratios than in the inviscid case ( @xmath82 in the plot ) , since large viscosity inhibits the growth of the instability .",
    "in addition , while in the inviscid case it has been shown that the sweet - parker current sheet may not be created naturally , as it turns out that it is much thinner than the critical width of the tearing instability ( @xmath168 ) , now there exists a range of prandtl numbers for which the viscous sweet - parker current sheet width , @xmath169  @xcite , is smaller than , or equal to , the critical width of the visco - tearing instability . to show this point , we represent with asterisks in the plot the maximum growth rate of current sheets having the same inverse aspect ratio of the viscous sweet - parker current sheet , @xmath170 . in particular , for high prandtl numbers , the critical aspect ratio equals the aspect ratio of the viscous sweet - parker current sheet when @xmath171 , i.e. , for @xmath172 . as a consequence , one may expect that for @xmath173 tearing instability is disruptive on current sheets thinner than the sweet - parker one .",

    "large viscosity inhibits the growth of the instability so as to allow for the formation of quasi - stable current sheets thinner with respect to the inviscid case .",
    "this may be important in two respects .",
    "on the one hand we have shown that the viscous sweet - parker quasi stationary reconnecting configuration is stable for prandtl numbers @xmath174 , for instance , if @xmath161 then for @xmath175 ( cfr .",
    "[ ga ] ) . as a consequence",
    ", viscous stabilization may be important in the solar wind , where reconnection exhausts reminiscent of the sweet - parker or petschek - like configuration are observed in regions of relatively large prandtl numbers @xmath176  @xcite .",

    "<S> we extend their analysis to include the effects of viscosity , ( always present in numerical simulations along with resistivity ) and which may play a role in the solar corona and other astrophysical environments . </S>",
    "<S> a finite prandtl number allows current sheets to reach larger aspect ratios before becoming rapidly unstable in pile - up type regimes . </S>",
    "<S> scalings with lundquist and prandtl numbers are discussed as well as the transition to kinetic reconnection . </S>"
