    "along the last decades , the emergence of quantum information @xcite raised a singular outlook in the physical science towards the development of a solid - state quantum engineering.@xcite this was supported by the contemporary progress of mesoscopic physics , where the modern laboratory techniques gave a comprehensive access to quantum phenomena in solid - state structures at the nanoscale .",
    "presently , many efforts are devoted to the design of nanostructured devices for the controlled manipulation of light and matter in the search for functional quantum phenomena .",
    "a paradigmatic example is quantum _ entanglement _ , non - local correlations considered a precious resource for quantum - information processing .    among the artificial nanostructures",
    "stand out the so - called _",
    "quantum corrals_. these are arrays of adatoms deposited on the surface of nobel metals , forming a nearly closed structure within which surface electrons can remain confined .",
    "quantum corrals have allowed the observation of outstanding effects such as quantum mirages , @xcite where the introduction of an impurity on one of the foci of an elliptic structure forms a ghost image in the empty one.@xcite several authors have analyzed these experiments with one or more impurities considering different configurations.@xcite it was suggested that two impurities which are located at the foci of the system will interact strongly as a consequence of the focalizing properties of quantum elliptic corrals .",
    "@xcite ( alternative locations apart from the foci were also suggested@xcite for the production of quantum mirages ) .",
    "this depends on the competition between rkky and kondo interactions.@xcite a preliminary study of quantum entanglement in such systems was done in ref . .",
    "there , it was found that the localized spins develop a strong mutual entanglement for a small superexchange coupling to the surface electronic states , whereas they disentangle for a strong coupling ( when compared to the corresponding kondo temperature ) .",
    "these results suggest that quantum corrals are suitable for essaying possible applications in quantum information and spintronics.@xcite for instance , magnetic impurities added on the foci could be used as quantum units of information ( qubits ) where quantum correlations ( entanglement ) mediated by delocalized electronic states are favored by focusing and confinement effects.@xcite eventually , quantum corrals could serve as elementary prototypes for quantum - information processors provided that logical gates can be implemented by controlled manipulation of the interaction between the magnetic qubits.@xcite    here we study the entanglement developed between two magnetic impurities embedded in a confined electronic environment .",
    "this corresponds to a nanostructured kondo system , where localized magnetic impurities are subject to an effective ( rkky - like @xcite ) exchange interaction mediated by electron - in - a - box states coupled antiferromagnetically ( afm ) to the impurities .",
    "the key element in our discussion is the electron confinement.@xcite here , in contrast to extended systems with electrons organized in a fermi sea,@xcite the strength of the quantum correlations is determined by the electron _",
    "filling_. for an extended kondo model , the ground state of the composed two - impurity / electron system forms a spin singlet .",
    "@xcite cho and mckenzie @xcite have shown that this reduces the two - impurity subsystem to a ( mixed ) rotationally invariant werner state.@xcite this is a particular family of ( mainly mixed ) states characterized by a single parameter identified with the impurity - spin correlation function , defining a one - dimensional phase space running continuously from a fully uncorrelated classical ensamble to a fully entangled ( singlet ) state .",
    "we shall see that confined kondo systems with even electronic filling share similar properties .",
    "an odd electronic filling , instead , takes the two - impurity subsystem away from the werner - state family to a region of the hilbert space with broken rotational symmetry and richer entanglement characteristics .",
    "such an extended family can not be fully described by a single observable . instead",
    ", as we shall see , it unfolds a two - dimensional phase space .",
    "moreover , it is known that entanglement does not guarantee _ non - locality _ : while the former refers to the ( non)separability of a quantum state , the latter is defined only by the violation of bell - like inequalities ( meaning that quantum correlations can not be modeled by a hidden classical - variable theory ) . within the werner - state family , indeed , there exists a subclass of entangled states which do not violate bell s inequalities .",
    "the development of non - locality requires to overcome a minimal amount of entanglement ( measured in terms of , e.g. , the _ concurrence _",
    "we shall see that an odd electronic filling generally constrains the impurity - spin system to develop a larger amount of entanglement for the violation of bell s inequalities when compared to the case of even electronic filling .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ iesiss ] we discuss the role played by the electronic filling on the reduced impurity - spin system based on symmetry arguments , only . in sec .",
    "[ entan ] we introduce a phase - space diagram classifying the entanglement properties of the impurity - spin system and discuss the conditions necessary for the development of non - local correlations .",

    "we study the complementary entanglement arising between the impurity - spins and a confined electronic bath . finally , in sec .",
    "[ nsqc ] we present numerical results corresponding to kondo - model simulations for an elliptic quantum corral discussing the distribution of solutions over the entanglement phase - space diagram .",
    "we start by considering a generic pure state @xmath0 of the composed system @xmath1 with a definite @xmath2-projection of the total spin @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 name the impurity spins and @xmath6 identifies a set of @xmath7 electrons confined within an arbitrary nanoscopic system ( see fig .",

    "further consequences follow from considering those symmetry constraints present in ( though not limited to ) elliptic quantum corrals with magnetic impurities at the foci .",
    "the reflection symmetry along the minor axis implies that @xmath23 must be invariant under magnetic impurity interchange .",
