    "according to general relativity , an object of nuclear density and more than 2.8 m@xmath2 would be a black hole ( kalogera & baym 1996 , friedman & ipser 1987 ) .",
    "several black hole candidates ( bhcs ) have been found in x - ray binary systems . at this time",
    "there are ten galactic x - ray sources known to exceed the neutron star ( ns ) mass limit .",
    "only two of these , cyg x-1 and lmc x-3 , are not in low mass binary systems .",
    "perhaps twenty more candidates have been identified via spectral similarities ( e.g. see barret , mcclintock & grindlay 1996 ) .",
    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are also generally believed to exceed a schwarzschild mass limit , however , they will be considered here only in passing in order to restrict the scope of a lengthy article .",
    "in addition , their radii are less well constrained than those of the x - ray novae .",
    "nevertheless , it should be noted that there are strong spectral similarities between nss , bhcs and agns .",
    "campana et al .",
    "( 1998a ) , becker & trmper ( 1998 ) and van der klis ( 1994 ) have recently reviewed ns properties , while poutanen ( 1998 ) has reviewed bhcs and agns .",
    "x - ray novae display a rich mix of spectral and timing characteristics .",
    "many of them are keyed to the luminosity level .",
    "luminosity generally derives from accretion of mass from a companion star via an accretion disk .",
    "flares are caused by instabilities of the flow either from the companion or through the disk .",
    "maximum luminosities during major flares are often @xmath3 times quiescent luminosities .",
    "maximum luminosities are often near the eddington limit ( @xmath4 erg / s for a canonical 1.4 m@xmath2 ns ) .",
    "complex changes of luminosities in soft x - rays ( 0.1 - 4.0 kev ) , hard x - rays ( 4 - 20 kev ) and hard tails , ( 20 - 200 kev ) occur during flares",
    ". hard tail luminosity with an inverse power law dependence on photon energy is prominent during the initial rise of luminosity and also during the decay . in most cases",
    "this power law component weakens substantially at high overall luminosities .",
    "`` ultrasoft '' radiation ( white & marshall 1984 ) with a general brehmsstrahlung shape and a peak near 1 - 3 kev is often , but not always , seen at high luminosities .",
    "observations during `` dips '' where some sources , seen at large inclination through absorbing materials , provide some spatial resolution , show that the soft peaks arise near the center of the the disk .",
    "bhcs simultaneously show hard tails and softer , more luminous peaks more commonly than nss .",
    "spectral state switches occur between soft `` high '' luminosity states and the harder `` low '' states that are characterized by power law spectral features .",
    "hard low states typically have luminosities below @xmath5 erg / s for nss and below @xmath6 erg / s for bhcs .",
    "campana et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and zhang , yu & zhang ( 1998 ) have attributed the spectral state switch to `` propeller effects '' ( illarianov & sunyaev 1975 ) of magnetic fields for nss .",
    "black hole models usually attribute the switch to accretion disk instabilities . in either case",
    ", it is generally accepted that the hard spectrum of the low state originates in the accretion disk and that it persists , usually becoming harder , as quiescence is approached .",
    "there is no consensus about how it is produced .",
    "the strong similarities of quiescent nss and bhcs ( tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ) suggest that a common mechanism produces the quiescent luminosity .",
    "low frequency , @xmath7 6 hz , quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) often appear in suitably high states ( fortner , lamb & miller 1989 , miyamoto , kimura & kitamoto 1991 , makishima et al .",
    "1986 ) of both nss and bhcs .",
    "large amplitude flickering ( @xmath7 10@xmath8 - 10 s luminosity variation ) occurs when power law components are dominant , particularly at intermediate luminosity ( balucinska - church et al .",
    "1997 , tennant , fabian & shafer 1986 , stella et al .",
    "the variations of hard and soft x - rays are often correlated ( usually with delayed hard photons ) on short time scales ( @xmath9 s ) , but are uncorrelated ( pan et al . 1995 ) or anti - correlated on scales of hours or more .",
    "all of these features , some of which were once thought to be black hole signatures , have been observed in both bhcs and nss ( e.g. , see singh et al .",
    "1994 , barret , et al .",
    "1992 , churazov , et al .",
    "1995 , stella et al . 1985 , tanaka 1989 , van der klis 1994 ) .",
    "cir x-1 , which was dropped from the bhc list after displaying surface thermonuclear bursts , shows most of these characteristics .",
    "its wide array of spectral characteristics is likely due to a rather wide variation of accretion rates associated with an eccentric orbit .",
    "some nss show some features that are not obviously shared by bhcs .",
    "radio or x - ray pulsations , and surface thermonuclear bursts are ns signatures that have only been found in erstwhile bhcs such as cir x-1 .",
    "nss usually show bursts or pulses but not both .",
    "the accepted explanation for this dichotomy is a magnetic field , a ns signature , that can concentrate accreting matter in magnetic pole regions where fusion proceeds at rates high enough to suppress bursts ( taam & picklum 1978 ) .",
    "bursts are generally not observed for pulsars with @xmath10 g magnetic fields , but have been observed for millisecond pulsars , which have weaker fields .",
    "interaction of the accretion flow with the ns magnetic field is believed to account for the characteristics of color - color diagrams and hardness - intensity diagrams of `` atoll '' and `` z '' type nss .",
    "these sources have magnetic fields of @xmath11 g and @xmath12 g , respectively ( white and zhang 1997 ) .",
    "the peak accretion rates of zs are near eddington limits , while those of atolls are much lower .",
    "van der klis ( 1994 ) , who developed much of the atoll - z phenomenology has provided a review and a discussion of the similarities between the various states of bhcs and nss ; particularly the strikingly similar time - resolved power density spectra of flickering atolls and bhcs .",
    "the presence of a hard spectral tail at overall luminosity levels above @xmath6 erg / s is considered to be a reliable signature of a bhc ( barret , mcclintock & grindlay 1996 ) .",
    "why an accreting black hole should have this property is not understood ( kusunose , minishige & yamada 1996 , s.n .",
    "zhang , et al .",
    "1997 ) . with this exception ,",
    "the lack of spectral or timing signatures of black holes has left mass determination as the only way to certify a bhc ( mcclintock 1998 ) . until signatures of event horizons are found , it remains feasible to suppose that the bhcs might simply be massive neutron stars .",
    "the point of this work is to explore this possibility .",
    "bhcs as compact , massive nss could possess magnetic fields , and should have large surface binding energies and substantial redshifts of surface radiations .",
    "magnetic fields would permit a common mechanism for the spectral state switches of bhcs and nss .",
    "larger surface binding energies and redshifts for the more massive bhcs would make their surface emissions both brighter and softer .",
    "it would seem necessary to reject these possibilities before acceptance of the reality of event horizons for the bhcs . in order to pursue these possibilities in a quantitative way",
    ", a space - time metric that has no event horizon is needed .",
    "the yilmaz metric ( ym ) has been adopted here for this purpose .",
    "the massive ns hypothesis discussed here is only weakly dependent on metric properties in general , but depends crucially on the distinctions between surfaces and magnetic fields _ vs _ event horizons .",
    "it is shown here that ym and sm accretion disks have such similar properties that they essentially differ only by the presence / absence of a surface .",
    "although most of the mathematical details have been placed in an appendix , a comparison of the two metrics is given in section 2 .",
    "results for the two metrics for a simple model of a star of constant proper density ( clapp 1973 ) are also given .",
    "an object of this sort with a density in its outer layers corresponding to nuclear saturation density provides a rough approximation of a neutron star with a fairly stiff equation of state .",
    "it provides very conservative estimates of the radiant energy and redshifts to be expected for accretion reaching a massive ns surface .",
    "magnetic field phenomena that affect the accretion flow and spectral characteristic are outlined in section 3 .",
    "section 4 discusses magnetic and strong - field gravitational effects in nss and bhcs .",
    "section 5 considers the origins of various spectral characteristics and the implications for massive ns models .",
    "while not widely known , the yilmaz theory ( yilmaz 1958 , 1971 , 1975 , 1992 , 1994 , 1995 ) has some interesting positive features that may help to resolve the hiatus between general relativity and quantum mechanics . at this time , it is quite clear that one or both of these landmark theories of the twentieth century must be modified before they can be fully compatible .",
    "the yilmaz theory modifies general relativity primarily by the explicit inclusion of the stress - energy of the gravitational field as a source of space - time curvature . with a true field stress - energy the yilmaz theory possesses a field lagrangian and",
    "can be quantized ( yilmaz 1995 ) .",
    "although the yilmaz theory has been criticized , ( will 1981 ) the criticism appears to be based on an incorrect assumed form of the metric ( yilmaz 1981 ) .",
    "for the present purposes , the essential features of any alternative metric would be lack of event horizons and readily calculable ns characteristics . nevertheless , the yilmaz theory passes the four classic weak - field tests .",
    "it permits local energy - momentum conservation and has no adjustable parameters , no singularities and no event horizons ( alley 1995 , yilmaz 1994 ) .",
    "gravitationally compact objects can exist in the ym but they are not black holes .",
    "radially directed photons can always escape .",
    "the metric of space - time in the vicinity of neutron stars is dominated by the gravity of the star which is considered here to be a static object .",
    "the static limit interval in the yilmaz exponential metric is : @xmath13 + where : @xmath14 and u(r ) is the gravitational potential . in the sm : @xmath15 and : @xmath16 the gravitational potential at distance r from mass m , @xmath17 reaches @xmath18 at the photosphere of the sun , @xmath19 in the solar system relative to the great attractor , @xmath20 at the smallest agn radii of which we can be certain , @xmath21 at the innermost marginally stable orbit of a ns or bhc , @xmath22 at the surface of a maximum mass ns in the sm and 0.5 at the event horizon of a black hole .",
    "the five orders of magnitude jump from the solar system testing ground to the neutron star regime is good reason for caution about the acceptance of any strong - field theory of gravitation .",
    "the exponential metric can be inferred from special relativity and the principle of equivalence applied to frames co - moving with an accelerated particle ( einstein 1907 , rindler 1969 , yilmaz 1975 ) .",
    "this is a strong indication that the exponential metric is the proper static limit for gravitation . that this metric does not satisfy the field equations of general relativity was one of the motivations for the earliest version of the yilmaz theory ( yilmaz 1958 ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the the exponential metric is merely rescaled by addition of an arbitrary constant to the potential whereas the sm depends on an absolute potential . without this dependence ,",
    "event horizons could be transformed away . with the conventional choice of zero potential at infinity ,",
    "however , the two metrics are the same to first order in u(r ) .",
    "this is sufficient to insure that they give the same results in the four classic weak - field tests of general relativity .",
    "gravitational redshift of radiation observed distantly is given by ( rindler 1969 ) : @xmath23 and in the sm : @xmath24    \\(i ) accretion mechanics + in either metric there is an innermost marginally stable orbit that can be reached by an accreting particle .",
    "the orbital radius is ( see appendix ) @xmath25 in the ym . thus @xmath26 . in the sm @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "an accreting particle starts from a large radial distance , with essentially zero momentum and @xmath29 .",
    "its energy is @xmath30 . at @xmath31 in the ym ,",
    "the energy is @xmath32 ( see appendix ) .",
    "the binding energy at @xmath31 is the difference , @xmath33 .",
    "whether this is radiated or advected depends on the opacity of the accretion disk and the viscous dissipation mechanisms . for any circular orbit in the disk ,",
    "the particle energy in the ym can be shown to be @xmath34 .",
    "thus , in the ym the maximum fraction of accretion mass energy which can be observed as radiation from the disk is : @xmath35 limited to u @xmath36 0.191 . for the sm",
    "the maximum fraction of accretion mass energy which can be radiated from the disk , limited to u @xmath36 1/6 and 0.057m@xmath37 , is : @xmath38 if the innermost marginally stable orbit is the inner disk boundary , disk mechanics and disk luminosity should be only weakly mass dependent and very nearly the same for the two metrics . the binding energy at @xmath31 differs by only 3.6% in the two metrics .",
    "it is independent of both the mass of the central object and @xmath31 . for the star model used here",
    ", disks would terminate at r@xmath39 above the surface for nss with masses above 2.1 m@xmath2 ( ym ) or 1.7 m@xmath2 ( sm ) . for stars with sufficiently weak magnetic fields ( @xmath40 )",
    "this `` gap accretion '' would produce a hard power - law spectrum ( kluzniak & wilson 1991 , hanawa 1991 , walker 1992 ) arising from bulk flow comptonization in a boundary layer .",
    "in fact , however , radiation ( miller , lamb & psaltis 1997 ) and/or magnetic torques ( lai 1998 ) on the disk appear to cause the inner disk radius of nss to be larger yet . at present",
    "it seems likely that khz qpos may be generated at the sonic point just inside the disk ( miller , lamb & psaltis 1997 ) .",
    "the observed qpo frequencies indicate that the sonic radius is generally larger than @xmath31 , but may approach @xmath31 as a limit at sufficiently high accretion rates ( zhang , et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the keplerian frequency of the innermost marginally stable orbit is of considerable interest . in the ym ,",
    "keplerian frequencies are given by : @xmath41 for the innermost marginally stable orbit , u = 0.191 and @xmath42 , this yields @xmath43 hz , compared to 2200 m@xmath44 hz in the sm ; a mere 7% difference .",
    "for neutron stars there is additional energy dissipated as accreting particles are brought to rest on the surface . neglecting the effects of star spin and evaluating",
    "the energy - momentum four - vector for zero momentum shows the energy of a particle at rest on a star of radius r to be e = m@xmath45 .",
    "thus the total accretion energy , external to the star , which may be directly radiated to distant observers is @xmath46 .",
    "the fraction radiated from the star surface itself ( neglecting fusion , which can be considered as part of the binding to the star ) would be : @xmath47 + in the strong - field cases to be considered here , over half of the energy release exterior to the star occurs within 3r and @xmath7 90% from within 10r .",
    "\\(ii ) compact objects + a compact object of constant proper density ( clapp 1973 ) is considered here .",
    "the details are straightforward , but tedious , and have been placed in the appendix .",
    "the proper density is @xmath48 = @xmath49 , a constant .",
    "these compact objects have a characteristic radius and mass that are given by : @xmath50 @xmath51    as shown in table 3 , g(r ) reaches 0.25 at the surface of a maximum mass ns in the sm . assuming that @xmath52 @xmath53 , the nuclear saturation density , and using @xmath54 yields @xmath55 .",
    "this value of @xmath49 yields : @xmath56 km and @xmath57 . in turn , these yield a maximum mass of @xmath58 for 14.3 km radius and a maximum radius of 15.5 km for the sm .",
    "independent of the choice of @xmath49 , nss in the upper one third of the mass range permitted by the sm would have u(r ) @xmath59 1/6 and have radii small enough for gap accretion .",
    "for the same @xmath49 in ym , the maximum mass is 9 m@xmath2 at a radius of 13.5 km .",
    "a maximum radius of 18.8 km occurs for about 5.1 m@xmath2 .",
    "mass vs.radius curves are similar in shape to those obtained by friedman & ipser ( 1987 ) for their core model .",
    "although the constant proper density model fails to properly account for the softer exterior layers for low mass objects , this will be of no concern here .",
    "the effects of stellar rotation may increase maximum masses ( friedman & ipser 1987 ) by about 25% , to about 3 m@xmath2 for the sm and 11 m@xmath2 for the ym . figure 1 shows comparisons of mass , radius and surface redshift for ym and sm .",
    "it is interesting that there exists a maximum mass for the ym that is dependent on density . for nuclear density ,",
    "an 11 m@xmath2 maximum mass may be adequate to cover the range of masses that have been found for the galactic bhcs .",
    "figure 2 shows properties for the sm in more detail .",
    "tables 2 and 3 give masses , radii , surface potentials , surface redshifts , etc for the two metrics . with these quantities , the necessary binding fractions of the disk and surface can be calculated using equations 7 - 9 .",
    "figure 3 shows these binding fractions . a profound effect of a neutron star surface is implied by fig 3 .",
    "up to about @xmath7 1.4 m@xmath2 , the luminosity would be fairly evenly divided between disk and surface , but for the largest masses in the schwarzschild metric up to 80% of the luminosity might arise inside the last stable orbit ; near or on the star surface . in the ym",
    "as much as 90% of the luminosity could originate from the star surface .",
    "the binding fractions at the star surface can reach 70% for large masses in the ym .",
    "large binding fractions and redshifts would make their surface radiations very prominent and very soft .",
    "\\(iii ) internal processes + after accreted matter reaches the surface there is still energy to be produced by fusion and a need for additional gravitational binding energy to be released for stability of the star . in order to properly account for all of the energy available , one needs to consider the difference between free baryon mass and mass bound gravitationally within the star .",
    "the total gravitational energy release as rest mass @xmath60 falls from a large distance and becomes bound in the star would be @xmath61 , or @xmath62 . the term in parentheses being the maximum possible fraction of accreted rest mass to be converted to radiations seen by a distant observer .",
    "it is plotted in figure 4 as the gravitational binding fraction of the object . for a neutron star in the sm",
    ", it actually diverges shortly after it reaches 1.0 just below 2.35 m@xmath2 . at this point",
    "the constant intrinsic density model fails in the sm .",
    "the addition of more mass simply causes a core collapse , though it may be possible that some of the binding energy would escape through neutrino emission , pair production and gravitational radiation .    in the ym",
    "there is no discontinuity of binding fraction but after trapped baryons produce a maximum gravitational mass , the star can become more tightly bound .",
    "the more massive neutron stars permitted in either metric swallow baryons but must radiate their mass equivalents for stability .",
    "it is apparent that the overall binding fraction is much larger than the binding fraction at the surface .",
    "some substantial additional radiations of internal origin should be seen from accreting nss in either metric .",
    "it is possible that this energy would appear as copious photon , pair production or neutrino emissions , or gravitational radiation .",
    "pair plasma emissions might be part of the jets observed for some nss and bhcs ( gliozzi , bodo , & ghisellini 1998 ) . whether or not accretion energy might be transiently stored has not been considered here , but it should be noted that mass - energy can be trapped inside the photon sphere for @xmath63 ( ym ) or 1/3 ( sm ) .",
    "spectral qualities of surface radiations should also be affected when the surface lies inside the photon sphere , however , this would involve analysis well beyond the scope appropriate for this work .",
    "the magnetosphere radius can be estimated as the radius for which the impact pressure of accreting matter is some fraction , @xmath64 , of magnetic pressure ( e.g. , lamb , pethick & pines 1973 ) .",
    "for dipole fields and disk accretion , with keplerian motion outside the magnetopause , this criterion yields : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the ratio of radial flow velocity to free fall velocity in a spherical flow , @xmath67 is the ratio of disk thickness to radius and b is the magnetic field at r. a choice of @xmath68 brings the magnetospheric radius into close agreement with that of the much more complicated model of ghosh & lamb ( 1992 ) . using @xmath69 cm and @xmath70 g / s",
    "this becomes : @xmath71 the magnetosphere radius shrinks to accomodate higher impact pressure .",
    "it is relatively impermeable to diamagnetic plasma , but unstable for curvature perturbations ( rayleigh - taylor ) .",
    "arons et al .",
    "( 1984 ) have described shot penetrations of the magnetopause and their further fragmentation via kelvin - helmholtz processes as they fall through the co - rotating magnetosphere . at relatively low accretion rates",
    "individual shots may produce considerable flickering . the larger surface binding fractions for more massive objects in the ym might explain the larger amplitude flickering observed for bhcs . for recent reviews of magnetospheric phenomena ,",
    "see campana et al .",
    "( 1998a ) and becker and trmper ( 1997 ) .",
    "it is well - known that pulsars can generate very hard spectra via magnetospheric effects ( michel 1991 , becker & trmper 1997 ) and surface impact ( alme & wilson 1973 ) as well as in shock fronts where magnetospherically expelled matter impinges on nebulae .",
    "the star spin frequency determines the co - rotation radius , @xmath72 , for which the magnetospheric equator rotates at the keplerian orbit frequency . in ( sm ) , @xmath73 .",
    "when the magnetospheric radius lies outside the co - rotation radius , accreting matter receives a super - keplerian push at the magnetopause .",
    "it is swept outward and is unable to penetrate the magnetosphere until a boundary layer with sufficient pressure builds .",
    "this is the well - known `` propeller effect '' ( illarianov & sunyaev 1975 ) .",
    "when the magnetosphere is forced inside the co - rotation radius , the spectrum changes from a hard , low state to a state of higher luminosity and softer spectrum due to greater surface contributions .",
    "if the transition radius is large there may be a large flare as mass strikes the star . since the co - rotation radius is determined by the spin",
    ", there is a strong luminosity - spin correlation for these flares ( stella , white & rosner 1986 ) .",
    "additional evidence has recently been found ( cui 1997 ) for propeller effects in the accreting x - ray pulsars , gx 1 + 4 and gro j1744 - 28 .",
    "sharp transitions were observed at luminosities of @xmath74 erg / s , for which x - ray pulsations ceased , but became re - established at slightly higher luminosity levels .",
    "zhang , yu & zhang ( 1998 ) and campana , et al .",
    "( campana , s. et al .",
    "1998b ) have independently analyzed the decline of the 1997 outburst of aql x-1 and found strong evidence of a propeller effect and an accompanying spectral state transition with very little luminosity change .",
    "the transition was followed by a rapid cutoff of luminosity that was arrested only briefly as radiation pressure from the surface emissions ceased .    for sufficiently large @xmath72",
    ", the maximum luminosity that can be achieved without surface contributions corresponds to @xmath75 and @xmath76 : @xmath77 or @xmath78where @xmath79 hz .",
    "campana et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have produced the same equation for spherical accretion except for a multiplier of 20 in place of the 1.2 used here .",
    "the smaller multiplier merely reflects the smaller magnetospheric area impacted by a disk .    for objects more massive than @xmath80 , classical physics expressions for surface luminosity are inadequate , however",
    ", we can use @xmath81 , where y is the fraction of mass reaching the magnetopause that penetrates to the surface . using this to evaluate @xmath82 and setting @xmath75 in eq .",
    "13 provides a relation of the luminosity for accretion at the co - rotation radius to the magnetic field and spin of the star : @xmath83 or @xmath84 eqs .",
    "16 and 18 should yield identical results for y = 0 , however , since the classical and relativistic binding energies differ slightly for the inner disk , there can be spurious small differences .    @xmath85 will be used to designate the accretion rate for which y=1 , @xmath86 , and all of the accreting matter reaches the star .",
    "if the co - rotation radius is relatively large compared to the star radius , large luminosity changes can occur at the transition from @xmath87 to @xmath85 , even if the accretion rate changes very little .",
    "even slight departures from y = 0 might produce such strong radiation pressure that the full transition to @xmath85 is prevented .",
    "the magnetosphere is limited by the light cylinder radius , @xmath88 , at which a co - rotating magnetosphere equator would move at the speed of light . for fast spinners with @xmath89 can be less than @xmath90 .",
    "when the magnetospheric radius lies beyond @xmath88 the radio pulsar mechanism may become active .",
    "both pulsed point source x - ray emissions and diffuse harder radiation at lower luminosity from a synchrotron nebula have been observed for the isolated @xmath91-ray pulsar psr 1055 - 52 ( shibata et al.1997 apj 483 , 843 ) .",
    "the maximum quiescent luminosity that can be produced solely by disk accretion corresponds to @xmath92 . with @xmath93 ,",
    "this yields : @xmath94 or @xmath95 if a pulsar wind drives the quiescent luminosity , the rotational energy loss rate is ( bhattacharya & srinivasan 1995 ) : @xmath96 where i is the moment of inertia of the star .",
    "the right member of this equation is empirical , lacking magnetic axis inclination dependence and perhaps factors of @xmath64 and @xmath66 , however , it and the middle member have been taken as an operational definition of the magnetic moment , @xmath97 , for nss with @xmath98 .",
    "becker and trmper ( 1997 ) have provided a tight correlation between x - ray luminosity and rotational energy loss rate for which the x - ray luminosity is @xmath99 again with fixed i = @xmath100 g @xmath101 . while most of the correlated sample likely consists of stars near @xmath102 , what has really been correlated is x - ray luminosity and @xmath103 .",
    "had a different value of i been used in the calculation of @xmath104 , the multiplier that would correlate with the x - ray luminosity would be @xmath105 .",
    "for use with the ym , @xmath106 , appropriate for @xmath102 and @xmath107 will be used here . in this way",
    "the ym model can be satisfied while maintaining relatively accurate x - ray luminosities . combining this with the right member of eq .",
    "21 yields : @xmath108 in contrast to previous equations , this is merely a well grounded empricicism that represents some loosely defined x - ray luminosity rather than a bolometric luminosity .",
    "still it is to be preferred over @xmath109 for quiescent luminosity .    for accretion to reach",
    "the star surface , with quiescent luminosities of @xmath110 erg / s being above @xmath87 , would require a combination of very weak field and small co - rotation radius ( fast spin ) .",
    "if most nss reach a spin equilibrium for long time average luminosities near those in accord with eq . 18 with y = 1 , ( white & zhang 1997 ) then their quiescent luminosities are highly unlikely to derive from either surface accretion or accretion at the light cylinder radius .",
    "becker and trmper s ( 1997 ) strong correlation of x - ray luminosity with magnetic field strength and spin rate down to luminosities well below @xmath111 erg / s strongly suggests that a preponderance of the quiescent luminosity is magnetospheric .",
    "there are reasons for believing that the power - law portions of quiescent emissions originate near the magnetopause ( see below ) .",
    "nevertheless , some quiescent luminosity may derive from a cooling ns surface .",

    "mbb spectral fits ( belloni et al 1997 ) show that @xmath181 oscillates between about 20 km and 80 km , but occasionally reaches only 55 km , followed immediately by another burst .",
    "55 km would be the innermost marginally stable orbit radius ( ym ) for @xmath159 , which is therefore adopted as the mass .",
    "a 67 hz qpo has been observed ( remillard et al 1997 , remillard & morgan 1998 ) that is sharp ( @xmath238 ) , stable for factors of 5 luminosity change and stable over six months time .",

    "speculating that this is the spin frequency , a co - rotation radius of 163 km ( ym ) is implied .",
    "the speculative 67 hz spin frequency must be tested by further observations .",
    "there are two sources of drifts and broadening for this qpo .",
    "orbital characteristics may imprint cyclical variations on it .",
    "observing it at high luminosities with radial expansion of the surface layers may broaden it .",
    "if some of the hard secondary bursts that have been observed ( taam , chen and swank 1997 ) originate on the surface , as seems to be implied by the small radii determined for them , they may also show identifiable spin qpos .",
    "the low state between flares reached about @xmath239 erg / s for a radius of about 80 km .",
    "evaluating @xmath201 for 80 and 163 km , calculating @xmath240 g / s for the 80 km radius and scaling it for 163 km , ( @xmath241 ) permits the calculation of @xmath242 erg / s .",
    "if the accretion rate of @xmath243 g / s for the cutoff state were to impact the surface after refilling the inner disk , the luminosity could be driven to @xmath244 erg / s , if not for the eddington limit ( @xmath245 erg / s ) .",
    "the excess energy above the observed @xmath246 erg / s may well be what drives the jets . in the 10 - 50",

    "eq 22 yields an expected quiescent x - ray luminosity of @xmath250 erg / s . in all parameters ,",
    "grs 1915 + 105 seems to be like gro j1655 - 40 and cir x-1 , both of which are also chaotically variable in both x - ray and radio regimes .",
    "it should be clear from the low value of @xmath87 , that accreting mass should have reached the surface at all times for the observed oscillation luminosities under consideration .",
    "that it apparently did not , judging by the hard spectrum after a burst , is due to the empty inner disk after the burst .",
    "the star behaves as a relaxation oscillator between the super - eddington flares and innermost marginally stable orbit . for oscillations ,",
    "it is critical that the magnetic field be of the right strength to just require flows near the eddington limit to drive the magnetosphere near the marginally stable orbit . massive stars with very large surface efficiencies can then provide a strong burst as mass hits the surface .",
    "the oscillating state might require a balance of fields and accretion rates too delicate for achievement by low mass neutron stars that have no accretion gaps .",
    "for this discussion it must be remembered that there are only two reliable distinguishing spectral characteristics of bhcs .",
    "these are the simultaneous presence of hard spectral tails and ultrasoft spectral components above @xmath6 erg / s and larger amplitude flickering for some bhcs .",
    "both are indicators of larger masses for bhcs in the massive ns model .",
    "no event horizon explanation has been proposed for them for black hole models .",
    "flickering can be explained by shot penetrations of the magnetopause , as illustrated by the flickering pulsar , vo332 + 53 .",
    "a shot mechanism has the virtue of being able to account for the strong coherence ( nowak et al .",
    "1998 ) of soft and hard emissions during flickering .",
    "stronger flickering of the bhcs is due to their larger surface binding energies .",
    "the quenching of the hard spectral tail of the low mass nss is due to the fact that @xmath6 erg / s is a much larger fraction of the eddington limit for low mass nss . at this and higher luminosities",
    ", radiation pressure inflates the inner disk and the flood of soft photons cools the comptonization region .",
    "the magnetosphere would not be inside the co - rotation radius for many bhcs at @xmath6 erg / s .",
    "these would automatically have hard spectra at this luminosity .",
    "three separate regions contribute to the spectra of nss .",
    "these are the surface and co - rotating magnetosphere , the inner disk - magnetopause , and the outer disk .",
    "it is accepted that blackbody and/or thermal brehmsstrahlung spectra of @xmath251 2 kev arises from the region near the surface .",
    "hard power - law radiations seem to come from the inner disk - magnetopause region , and soft excess themal radiations @xmath251 0.1 - 0.6 kev originate from the outer disk .",
    "not only are these spectrally different regions , they have been spatially resolved in dip observations .",
    "morley et al . (",
    "1998 ) have analyzed deep ( 100% ) dips in the high state spectrum of xb 1916 - 053 to show that @xmath252 kev blackbody emissions arise from a rapidly covered central ns while a strong power - law spectrum beyond 100 kev with photon index of 1.75 was produced by a larger emission region .",
    "observations of hard , low states show dominant power - law spectra along with a low temperature soft excess that produces a few percent of the luminosity .",
    "exactly the same spectral features and some of the same spatial features have been observed for bhcs . for bhcs , however , the strong soft radiations are attributed to the disk and are usually represented by mbb radiation functions .",
    "it is a stroke of good fortune that mbb functions represent the central soft sources of both nss and bhcs , but certainly no proof of an event horizon . a similar analysis of high state dips of the bhc gro j1655 - 40 ( kuulkers et al .",
    "1997 ) revealed a bright , but unresolved central region that produced a power - law and a mbb of 1.1 kev temperature .",
    "the entire x - ray emitting region was found to be smaller than @xmath253 km .",
    "the disk diameter at the co - rotation radius found here for this source would be 550 km .",
    "the inner disk would have to be smaller than this for a ns to produce the high state . in a similar way , the times of ingress and egress for dips of cygnus x-1 ( kitamoto et al .",
    "1984 ) constrain the size of the region of origin of its low state hard spectrum to be of order 4000 km for luminosities for which the disk inner diameter would be near 3400 km ( misra & melia 1997 ) .",
    "thus the inner disk - magnetopause region is a likely site of hard photon production",
    ". this would be consistent with the large solid angles relative to the disk seen for reflected x - rays as disk radii expand in decline .",
    "zhang , yu & zhang ( 1998 ) have suggested that flow reversal at the magnetopause could produce a hard power - law spectrum by the same bulk comptonization mechanism examined by kluzniak & wilson ( 1991 ) , hanawa ( 1991 ) , and walker ( 1992 ) for flow into a boundary layer .",
    "whether or not flow reversal bulk comptonization or magnetospherically driven return flows ( arons et al .",
    "1984 ) are related to the hard spectrum , the energy requirements for the power - law strongly suggests that it would have to originate in the inner disk .    for both cygnus x-1 ( balucinska - church et al .",
    "1997 ) and gro j1655 - 40 , ( kuulkers et al .",
    "1997 ) a soft excess was found to comprise @xmath254 6 - 8% of disk emissions .",
    "it was modeled as a blackbody in both cases .",
    "temperatures of 0.13 kev and 0.60 kev , respectively , were found for the soft excesses of the two sources .",
    "balucinska - church et al ( 1995 ) identified the soft excess as disk emissions .",
    "the relatively stronger presence of the soft excess in the deeper dips of gro j1655 - 40 confirms that they must arise from the outer disk .",
    "it is unlikely that all of the gravitational binding energy available from the outer disk is used in producing a soft excess luminosity .",
    "the soft excess is quite small compared to the power - law which also originates in the disk .",
    "however if the fraction of binding energy that produces the soft excess is roughly independent of radius , the disk temperature will still scale as @xmath255 .",
    "the temperature of 0.13 kev for cygnus x-1 at 1700 km scales up to 0.58 kev at the 230 km of gro j1655 - 40 .",
    "this provides additional confirmation of the outer disk as the source of much of the soft excess .",
    "an ultrasoft spectrum was first recognized for bhcs by white & marshall ( 1984 ) for lmc x-1 and lmc x-3 .",
    "analysis of rossi observations ( wilms et al .",
    "1998 ) of these persistent , high state sources have shown that their spectra can be fitted with a mbb ( or blackbody as well for lmc x-1 ) of temperature , @xmath256 = 1.0 and 1.25 kev , respectively for these sources , along with a power law .",
    "a 5 - 9 m@xmath2 yilmaz ns emitting as a blackbody would have a surface redshift of @xmath257 ( fig . 1 , table 2 )",
    ". a local surface temperature of 2.3 kev would produce a distantly observed apparent temperature of t/(1+z ) = 2 kev for a low mass ns and 1.3 - 0.7 kev for the bhc .",
    "thus bright , ultrasoft peaks are well explained for massive nss .",
    "we conclude that all of the distinguishing characteristics of bhcs are encompassed by the massive ns hypothesis .",
    "if a suitable model for nss were available , we might apply it with some confidence to the bhcs . unfortunately",
    ", none is available .",
    "blackbody or thermal brehmsstrahlung might be expected from near the star surfaces .",
    "such simple models ( as well as apparently inappropriate high temperature mbbs ) do a fair job of representing the soft spectral components of both bhcs and low mass nss .",
    "what is lacking is an understanding of the power - law emissions .",
    "they so dominate the low state spectra , leaving only small soft excesses , that an optically thick , viscosity dominated disk ( with its associated lower temperature mbb spectrum ) may not be an adequate starting point for the hard x - ray spectrum .",
    "it is not certain that an optically thick disk at the temperature of the soft excess could generate a sufficiently energized corona to produce the power - law component",
    ".    the low state disk may be optically thin for x - rays and/or advective , i.e. , not dominated by viscosity .",
    "an advective accretion flow ( adaf ) model was proposed ( narayan et al 1997 ) to explain the hard quiescent radiations of bhcs . in this model ,",
    "the disk is optically thin and very hot , and accretion rates above @xmath258 g / s are needed to produce quiescent luminosity . according to eq .",
    "14 , atoll sources with magnetic fields of @xmath259 g would have magnetospheric radii of 50 - 100 km for these accretion rates ( or less , accepting dong lai s suggestion ) . with spins of @xmath260",
    "hz they would produce @xmath261 erg / s for these accretion rates without any surface contributions and much more unless propeller effects block surface emissions completely . since quiescent luminosities of atolls",
    "are far below these levels , the high accretion rate adaf model is simply inapplicable to quiescent nss . recall that adaf models with transitions to the conventional optically thick , geometrically thin , disk ( esin , mcclintock & narayan 1997 ) at radii beyond @xmath262 have been shown ( @xmath180ycki , done & smith 1997 ) to fail for bhcs as well .",
    "finally , the presence of a hard spectrum for 1e1740.7 - 2942 for an inner disk radius of only 225 km shows that the adaf model simply can not be taken seriously .",
    "while there seems to be little to recommend pure adaf models , a combination of partially advective and magnetospheric effects can not be ruled out . an advective disk with a magnetospherically driven return flow ( arons et al .",
    "1984 ) might have some merit .",
    "advective flows can have positive energy for the return .",
    "the nature of the spectrum that would arise from within the magnetosphere for luminosities above @xmath87 is also unclear .",
    "the production of soft photons via cyclotron emission would be difficult to quantify .",
    "the spectrum of photons arising from the surface might be blackbody or thermal brehmsstrahlung .",
    "psaltis , lamb & miller ( 1995 ) have calculated spectra and successfully reproduced the color - color diagram for a z - source with an accretion disk - central corona - magnetosphere model .",
    "it possible that this model might be extended to encompass the hard spectrum of the propeller regime , for which the hot corona might be located at the magnetopause .",
    "the hard spectrum of sax j1808.4 - 3658 illustrates an additional difficulty for spectral models .",
    "the emergent observed spectrum may be strongly affected by inclination effects .",
    "black hole models must necessarily use an optically thick disk to produce soft peaks and some comptonization of soft photons to produce power - laws .",
    "although current models with central black holes and accretions disks have had some success in representing static spectra for some states of the bhcs , most models rely on features such as a hot central corona introduced in a purely _ ad hoc _ fashion .",
    "it remains to be shown rigorously that a hot central corona would develop for keplerian flow into an event horizon .",
    "the current `` sombrero '' models ( poutanen 1998 ) do a good job of representing some bhc spectra but require that the accretion disk intrusion into the central corona be `` just so '' to let just the right number of seed photons be compton scattered to produce the hard spectrum .",
    "it is not clear that such a model can account for the timing signatures within the spectrum .",
    "it must be acknowledged that active galactic nuclei pose an interesting challenge for any alternative theory of gravity .",
    "spectral state switches have been observed for them ( mannheim et al 1995 ) .",
    "they likely do not possess star cluster cores ( maoz 1995 ) .",
    "massive single objects with accretion disks might be possible but they would be most unusual astronomical objects .",
    "it can be readily seen from eqs .",
    "11 and 12 that a mean density of @xmath263 could correspond to a very compact object of @xmath264 that would not necessarily be a black hole , even in sm . given the extremely high efficiency of conversion of gravitational mass - energy to luminosity , there should be no problem modeling agn levels of radiation .",
    "but the constant proper density model is wholly inadequate .",
    "realistically , an object of such low density might need to be supported internally by radiation pressure ( but see graber 1998 ) and would likely have large density gradients and strong magnetic stresses .",
    "this is clearly a topic for another time , but one that should be pursued .",
    "black holes would certainly be simpler , but we should confirm them among the galactic bhcs , where we can strongly constrain masses and radii , if at all possible .",
    "the issue is clearly that of the existence or non - existence of an event horizon .",
    "ym objects with @xmath63 are more compact than black holes of the same mass and might well be of low luminosity with their surfaces inside the photon orbit .",
    "the characteristics of bhcs appear to be compatible with a massive ns model .",
    "the signatures of this model are strong magnetic fields , large surface binding energies and large redshifts of surface emissions .",
    "the field can produce power - law and gamma emissions , jets , spectral state switches and cyclotron emissions and the surfaces can produce ultrasoft peaks and large rms flickering .",
    "the magnetic field strengths and spins proposed here for bhcs are reasonably near the spin - up trend line from radio pulsars to millisecond pulsars . where co - rotation radii can be determined from spectral fit parameters , the corresponding spin rates and subsequently found magnetic field strengths imply quiescent luminosities in agreement with observations . due to their slower spins ,",
    "the magnetospheric contributions to the quiescent luminosities of the bhcs appear to be somehat smaller than those of the low mass atoll and z nss .",
    "the work of @xmath180ycki , done and smith ( 1998a ) describes a spectral state switch in exact accord with the magnetic propeller mechanism cutting off the flow to the surface with little change of inner disk radius .",
    "cir x-1 , the ns most like a bhc , has been found to have spin and magnetic field similar to many of the bhcs .",
    "the ubiquitous slow @xmath265 hz qpos found in high states of both bhcs and nss ( miyamoto , kimura & kitamoto 1991 , makishima et al .",
    "1986 ) . can be explained as accretion disk flow and opacity oscillations driven by surface radiations ( fortner , lamb & miller 1989 ) .",
    "it is not known how a black hole might produce them .",
    "a clear implication of the massive ns model is that hard spectral features arise from the inner disk ( magnetopause ? ) while soft spectral features can arise from both the disk and the surface .",
    "the strong reflected x - rays seen in hard states with fairly large solid angles subtended as the disk radius expands in decline , suggests that the magnetopause might be a primary site of hard photon production .",
    "adoption of the massive ns hypothesis would eliminate many difficulties for accretion disk theory .",
    "spectral state switches would no longer require discontinuous disk behavior for transitions between high and low states .",
    "an additional burden for disk theory is removed by no longer requiring disk explanations for occasional bhc failures to produce ultrasoft peaks at high luminosities .",
    "the massive ns hypothesis explains these as either magnetic axis orientation effects or failure of the inner disk to penetrate the co - rotation radius . the structure of the transition region near the magnetopause is likely to be much more complex than previously implied here .",
    "it is likely to be involved in a complicated , inclination dependent way in the production of the pairs of khz qpos .",
    "three of the bhc cases examined here , including cyg x-1 , seem to have spins below 10 hz and very strong magnetic fields .",
    "all are above the `` death line '' for pulsars , while v0332 + 53 , the original flickering pulsar , is not .",
    "cyg x-1 is a wind accreter that appears to be delicately balanced between intermediate and low states .",
    "its large co - rotation radius permits a large energy release and consequent large radiation pressure increase when mass does reach the star surface .",
    "the net effect is a somewhat self - regulated luminosity .",
    "it is likely near spin secular equilibrium , as are the zs and atolls .",
    "aside from their spins being revealed during bursts , the zs and atolls are not x - ray or radio pulsars .",
    "magnetic fields of order @xmath0 g and higher may be sufficient to suppress bursts , however , cir x-1 has exhibited bursts . the similarly weak magnetic fields of gro j1655 - 40 , a0620 - 00 and grs 1915 + 105 suggests that they should be carefully monitored for bursts ; indeed this last source may have already produced some ( taam , chen , & swank 1997 ) . that the stronger - field bhcs are not bursters would be expected .",
    "the lack of pulses requires near - coincident magnetic and spin axes or extreme magnetic fields .",
    "such a configuration is likely necessary for efficient production of jets and may enhance gamma emissions .",
    "khz qpos corresponding to the keplerian frequencies of the inner disk imply that the accretion disks of both nss and bhcs can reach to near the innermost marginally stable orbit . with a fixed binding energy for this orbit it seems clear that we must look for the differences between nss and bhcs inside this orbit .",
    "black hole disk models that are differentiated from ns disks without explicitly incorporating the differences between event horizons and star surfaces should have little credibility .",
    "a tremendous amount of detailed modeling will be necessary to extend the massive ns hypothesis beyond this introduction .",
    "the yilmaz modifications of general relativity have provided an acceptable basis for the explorations of the differences between surfaces and event horizons . the simplicity of the yilmaz theory , both mathematically and conceptually , warrants its continued use",
    ". its strong metric similarities to general relativity below @xmath266 and the lack of an event horizon beyond @xmath267 will provide for stringent comparisons of black hole vs ns models .",
    "the recent discovery of nss of approximately 2 m@xmath2 ( zhang et al .",
    "1998 ) should permit detailed comparisons of the two theories for nss in a range where differences might first appear .",
    "for example , the amplitudes of qpos generated from bursts might be expected to differ due to differences of gravitational curvature of photon trajectories .",
    "comparisons of this sort might be complicated for masses large enough for the surfaces to be inside the photon orbit .",
    "the important point , however , is that the yilmaz metric provides a sharp tool that should eventually decide the question of the existence of event horizons .",

    "the encouragement of prof .",

    "<S> recent work has linked the quiescent luminosities and hard / soft spectral state switches of neutron stars ( nss ) to their spinning magnetic fields . it is shown here that the quiescent luminosities and spectral state switches of galactic black hole candidates ( bhcs ) could be produced in the same way for spin rates below 100 hz and magnetic fields above @xmath0 g. it is also shown that the ultrasoft peaks and large flickering amplitudes of the bhcs would be expected from the surfaces of massive nss . </S>",
    "<S> none of the few spectral characteristics that distinguish bhcs from low mass nss have been explained in terms of event horizons </S>",
    "<S> . serious consideration of the possibility that they might simply be massive nss opens an avenue for proof of event horizons by negation , but requires the use of a space - time metric that has no event horizon . </S>",
    "<S> the yilmaz exponential metric used here is shown to have an innermost marginally stable orbit with radius , binding energy and keplerian frequency that are within a few percent of the same quantities for the schwarzschild metric . </S>",
    "<S> a maximum ns mass of @xmath1 is found for the yilmaz metric . </S>",
    "<S> the two metrics essentially differ only by the presence / absence of a surface for the bhcs , thus enabling proof or disproof of the existence of event horizons . </S>"
