    "parker ( 1966 ) demonstrated that the equilibrium state of interstellar gas , magnetic field , and cosmic - rays under the vertical gravity could be unstable to long wavelength perturbations along the direction of the equilibrium magnetic field .",
    "since then , many authors have studied the details of this instability . for instance , two - dimensional , nonlinear equilibrium states resulting from the parker instability under a uniform gravity were derived by mouschovias ( 1974 ) .",
    "the effects of rotation ( shu 1974 ; zweibel & kulsrud 1975 ; foglizzo & tagger 1994 ) , non - uniform gravity ( horiuchi 1988 ; matsumoto 1988 ; giz & shu 1993 ) , and skewed magnetic field ( hanawa 1992 ) on the parker instability were discussed .",
    "the parker instability was considered to be a plausible mechanism for the formation of large - scale interstellar clouds ( appenzeller 1974 ; mouschovias 1974 ; blitz & shu 1980 ; shibata & matsumoto 1991 ; gomez de castro & pudritz 1992 ) , a possible process for dynamo in accretion disks ( tout & pringle 1992 ) , and the force driving emergent flux tubes which are closely related to the active phenomena of the sun ( shibata 1989a , 1989b ; kaisig 1990 ; nozawa 1992 ) .",
    "the original analysis of the instability by parker ( 1966 ) was performed under a uniform gravity , although he commented on the effects of a non - uniform , linear gravity .",
    "since the uniform gravity has a jump at the mid - plane , the physical quantities should have a cusp .",
    "because of this , the perturbations in the upper hemisphere can not communicate with those in the lower hemisphere .",
    "so parker s analysis should have been restricted to the `` symmetric '' mode where the vertical velocity perturbation vanishes at the mid - plane . in order to remove this difficulty , a non - uniform gravity which changes smoothly at the mid - plane",
    "should be introduced .",
    "giz & shu ( 1993 ) considered the parker instability under a gravity whose functional form is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are constants , and @xmath7 is the vertical distance from the mid - plane . with the scale height of stars for @xmath6 , this gravity closely represents the galactic gravitational field . in the limit @xmath8",
    "it is reduced to a uniform gravity , while in @xmath9 it is reduced to a linear gravity . with this gravity ,",
    "giz & shu obtained a dispersion relation which matches that under the uniform gravity .",
    "they called it the `` continuum '' family .",
    "but , in addition , they found a dispersion relation which has no correspondence in the uniform gravity .",
    "they called the latter the `` discrete '' family . before giz & shu , horiuchi ( 1988 ) considered the parker instability under a point - mass - dominated gravity , which is continuous across the mid - plane .",
    "it is a good model for the gravitational field in accretion disks .",
    "they considered isothermal perturbations with the effective adiabatic index @xmath10 and obtained dispersion relations for both the symmetric and antisymmetric modes .",
    "their solutions correspond to the continuum family by the giz & shu classification .",
    "they did not see the solutions of the discrete family , since their analysis was restricted to isothermal perturbations .    in this paper , we consider a linear gravity whose functional form is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a constant .",
    "the linear gravity represents fairly well the @xmath7-dependence of the galactic gravity up to 500 pc ( oort 1965 ) , as well as the `` vertical '' gravity of accretion disks .",
    "it is also easier to handle than those introduced by giz & shu ( 1993 ) and horiuchi ( 1988 ) .",
    "although parker ( 1966 ) considered a linear gravity , all he did was to show that the equilibrium state of an interstellar gas - field system becomes also unstable under it . here , we investigate the resulting eigensolutions in detail : we classify them into the continuum and discrete families , discuss their nature , and give criteria for the existence of the unstable continuum and discrete families .",
    "although the existence of the discrete family was already discussed by giz & shu ( 1993 ) , our work would serve to get a better insight to its nature and its possible roles in astrophysics .",
    "several authors have reported that there exist corrugations in our galaxy ( quiroga & schlosser 1977 ; lockman 1977 ; spicker & feitzinger 1986 ; alfaro 1992 ; malhotra 1994 ) and external galaxies ( florido 1991 ) as well . nelson ( 1976 ) suggested that the corrugations may be a manifestation of hydrodynamic acoustic - gravity waves .",
    "the difficulties with nelson s suggestion are that the characteristic scale does not come out naturally and that the structures formed by the acoustic - gravity waves should be oscillatory and transient . instead ,",
    "in this paper we suggest that the corrugations may be formed as the results of the unstable discrete mode .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 the classification of the eigensolutions into the continuum and discrete families is given . in ",
    "3 the dispersion relations of the eigensolutions are analyzed in details .",
    "we first consider the dispersion relations of non - magnetized disks and then move to those of magnetized disks . in ",
    "4 a summary and discussion are given .",
    "the derivation of eigenvalue equations and the method we used to obtain the dispersion relation of the continuum family are described in appendices .",
    "we consider the stability of a disk composed of gas , magnetic field , and cosmic - rays under a linear gravity .",
    "for the unperturbed equilibrium state , we follow parker ( 1966 ) to assume that the gas is isothermal and that the ratio of magnetic pressure to gas pressure , @xmath13 , and the ratio of cosmic - ray pressure to gas pressure , @xmath14 , are spatially constant .",
    "then , the unperturbed gas density , gas pressure , cosmic - ray pressure , and magnetic pressure are given by a gaussian distribution in @xmath7 .",
    "the equations for the stability analysis are obtained by introducing an infinitesimal perturbation to the unperturbed equilibrium state .",
    "those equations can be combined into a single eigenvalue equation , which is a second - order differential equation .",
    "the detailed manipulation of the equations is described in appendix a. the resulting eigenvalue equation is @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are defined by @xmath18\\omega^2 + 2\\alpha\\gamma ( \\nu_x^2+\\nu_y^2)\\nu_y^2}{(2\\alpha+\\gamma)\\omega^2 - 2\\alpha\\gamma\\nu_y^2 } , \\eqnum{\\ref{e}}\\ ] ] @xmath19 } + \\frac{(1+\\alpha+\\beta ) ( 1+\\alpha+\\beta-\\gamma)(\\nu_x^2+\\nu_y^2 ) } { ( 2\\alpha+\\gamma ) \\omega^2 - 2\\alpha\\gamma\\nu_y^2}. \\eqnum{\\ref{v_o}}\\ ] ] here @xmath20 is a normalized @xmath7-coordinate , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are normalized radial and azimuthal wavenumbers , @xmath23 is a normalized angular frequency , and @xmath24 is a quantity proportional to the normalized vertical velocity multiplied by the square root of the unperturbed normalized gas density ( see eqs .  [",
    "[ vzdefine ] ] and [ [ norm_vari ] ] ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that @xmath25 is the kinetic energy density associated with the motion in the @xmath7-direction .",
    "normalization units are the disk scale height @xmath26 , sound speed of unperturbed state @xmath27 , and unperturbed gas density at the mid - plane @xmath28 . due to the simple functional form of the gravity we used ,",
    "we could get an eigenvalue equation which resembles the schrdinger equation with the potential of a harmonic oscillator . as the boundary condition",
    ", we assume that @xmath24 stays finite as @xmath29 .",
    "that is , the energy density perturbation does not diverge at infinite .",
    "the solutions of the eigenvalue equation can be classified into four different types by the signs of @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( figure  1 ) . if @xmath30 and @xmath31 so that @xmath16 is greater than @xmath32 in the whole range of @xmath20 , @xmath33 , all the positive values are allowed as the eigenvalue @xmath16 ( type i ) . in this case , the eigenfunction @xmath24 oscillates as @xmath34 increases . if @xmath35 and @xmath31 so that @xmath16 is smaller than @xmath32 in a finite interval which includes @xmath36 and greater than @xmath32 in the rest , all the negative values are allowed as the eigenvalue ( type ii ) .",
    "the eigenfunction declines exponentially in the finite interval but stays oscillatory outside it .",
    "if @xmath30 and @xmath37 so that @xmath16 is greater than @xmath32 in a finite interval but smaller than @xmath32 in the rest , only discrete positive values are allowed as the eigenvalue ( type iii ) .",
    "the eigenfunction oscillates in the interval but declines exponentially outside it . if @xmath35 and @xmath37 so that @xmath16 is smaller than @xmath32 in the whole interval , there are no physically meaningful solutions satisfying the boundary condition ( type iv ) . with the tangent hyperbolic gravity ,",
    "giz & shu ( 1993 ) also obtained an equation similar to eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) and classified its solutions into the continuum and discrete families . according to the giz & shu s classification , the solutions of type i and ii correspond to the continuum family and those of type iii to the discrete family .      for the continuum family with negative @xmath17",
    ", we introduce a new variable @xmath38 defined by @xmath39 and transform eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) into that for the parabolic cylinder function ( abramowitz & stegun 1970 ) : @xmath40 @xmath41 as @xmath42 increases , the parabolic cylinder function oscillates in the interval between nodal points . for @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "so the energy density perturbation of the continuum family decreases as @xmath45 at large @xmath42 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , for @xmath43 , the @xmath7 wavelength decreases as @xmath45 , hence the group velocity along the @xmath7-direction increases as @xmath42 .",
    "consequently the energy flux of the continuum family stays constant at large @xmath42 .",
    "the dispersion relations for the symmetric mode can be calculated by considering the lower boundary condition at the mid - plane , @xmath46 , while the dispersion relations for the antisymmetric mode by taking @xmath47 ( see appendix b ) . with the condition @xmath48 finite at @xmath43 , there exists , for a given pair of wavenumbers @xmath49 and @xmath50 , an interval of @xmath51 values . here , we find solutions with the energy density perturbation zero at the upper boundary which is identified to the first nodal point from the mid - plane , @xmath52 .",
    "then , the value of @xmath51 is uniquely determined for the given nodal point .",
    "since the nodal point indicates the position where the vertical velocity goes to zero , the distance to this nodal point may be considered as an `` effective '' wavelength along the @xmath7-direction . a method to find the value of @xmath51 with a chosen nodal point",
    "is described in appendix b.      for the discrete family with positive @xmath17 and positive @xmath16 , eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) has exactly the same form as the schrdinger equation with the potential of a harmonic oscillator .",
    "the solution of the harmonic oscillator problem is well known : the eigenfunctions are @xmath53 and the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the hermite polynomial of degree @xmath56 , and @xmath56 takes values @xmath57 .",
    "in this case , @xmath24 decreases exponentially at large @xmath34 , so the energy density perturbation of the discrete family does as well .",
    "the eigenfunctions for @xmath58 which have @xmath59 at @xmath36 represent the symmetric mode , while the eigenfunctions for @xmath60 which have @xmath61 at @xmath36 represent the antisymmetric mode .",
    "the eigenvalue relation of eq .",
    "( [ d_dispersion ] ) gives the dispersion relation , , @xmath51 as a function of @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath56 .",
    "here , @xmath56 indicates the number of nodal points along the @xmath7-direction , so it may be considered as the `` effective '' wavenumber in the @xmath7-direction .",
    "in this section , we explore the nature of the continuum and discrete families in detail by analyzing both the stable ( waves ) modes and the unstable ( instability ) modes .",
    "we first consider the case of non - magnetized disks , then include a magnetic field and cosmic - rays .      without a magnetic field ,",
    "the cosmic - rays are ignored , so @xmath62 . without a magnetic field , there is no preferred direction in the @xmath63 plane , and we can set @xmath64 without losing any generality .",
    "then , @xmath16 and @xmath17 become @xmath65 @xmath66 eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) with the above @xmath16 and @xmath17 is exactly the one nelson ( 1976 ) derived to study hydrodynamic acoustic - gravity waves under a linear gravity .    in the case of @xmath10 for isothermal perturbations",
    ", @xmath67 is always positive .",
    "so , eq .  ( [ master ] ) has only two types of solutions , type iii and type iv , depending on the sign of @xmath16 .",
    "the locus of @xmath68 is drawn with a dashed line in the phase space of @xmath50 and @xmath51 in figure  2a .",
    "we are interested only in the upper region of the line with @xmath30 where the solutions of type iii exist .",

    "( [ iso_dispersion ] ) reduces to the dispersion relation @xmath71 of sound waves for @xmath72 .",
    "so the dispersion relations are of the acoustic - gravity waves which have the characteristics of sound waves modulated by the vertical gravity , as was pointed out by nelson ( 1976 ) . in figure  2b ,",
    "the dispersion relations of the acoustic - gravity waves with @xmath73 are plotted with solid lines . in this case , no convective mode exits , so all the modes are stable .    if @xmath74 , the signs of both @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be positive or negative . in figures  3a and 4a , three loci of @xmath68 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 are drawn for @xmath77 and @xmath78 with a dashed line ( @xmath68 ) , a dotted line ( @xmath75 ) , and a long - dashed line ( @xmath76 ) .",

    "the solutions of the continuum family , which can be identified as the convective mode , are stable if @xmath80 , but unstable if @xmath81 , developing into the convective instability ( ryu & goodman 1992 ) .",
    "the mode with a larger @xmath82 is more unstable , because the gravity is a linearly increasing function of @xmath20 .    in the case of a uniform gravity ,",
    "the square of the maximum growth rate of the convective instability is @xmath83 ( ryu & goodman 1992 ) .",
    "for @xmath77 , it is @xmath84 . except at small wavenumbers , the growth rate of the convective instability under the linear gravity in figure  3b is larger than the maximum growth rate under the uniform gravity .",
    "the dispersion relations of the continuum family solutions shown in figures  3b and 4b are for the symmetric mode . in order to see the effects of the boundary condition at the mid - plane",
    ", we have also calculated the dispersion relations of the antisymmetric mode .",
    "figure  5 shows the resulting dispersion relations with nodal points at @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",

    "the growth rates of the both modes are nearly the same , unless @xmath87 .",
    "this is true , even if the magnetic field is included .",
    "the reason for this is that the gravity is small near the mid - plane .",
    "so the details around the mid - plane are not important unless @xmath87 . in the rest of the paper",
    ", we then present only the dispersion relation of the symmetric mode for the continuum family solutions .        taking the limit @xmath88 means also making @xmath89 .",
    "so the problem reduces to that of finding the dispersion relation in a uniform medium without gravity . since the perturbation of cosmic - ray pressure is zero in the uniform medium ( see [ [ o_cosmic ] ] )",

    "the above dispersion relation can be decoupled into one for the alfvn waves @xmath92 and the other for the slow and the fast mhd waves @xmath93 here , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the alfvn and adiabatic sound speeds .",
    "it is known that the growth rate of the parker instability is larger for perturbations with larger @xmath97 wavenumbers ( parker 1967 ) . however , in this subsection we first consider the case of @xmath64 in detail , since the equations involved are much simple and yet most important physical aspects are included .",
    "we comment briefly on the general case of @xmath98 in the next subsection .    in the case of @xmath64 ,",

    ", the unstable modes of the continuum solution may , however , develop within the life time .",
    "therefore , developments of the unstable modes of the continuum solution of the parker instability under the linear gravity are not confined to spiral arms but ubiquitous in the galaxy .",
    "we also suggest that the corrugations observed in our galaxy and external galaxies may have been formed by the unstable discrete mode . for parameters , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath119 , and @xmath64 , the growth time of the most unstable discrete solution with @xmath135",
    "is @xmath136 years at the wavelength of @xmath137 kpc .",
    "this time scale is comfortably shorter than the age of the galaxies , and the length scale is consistent with the characteristic wavelength of the vertical structure of the carina - sagittarius spiral arm ( alfaro 1992 ) .",
    "furthermore , the antisymmetric nature of the @xmath135 solution is also consistent with the corrugations found by alfaro ( 1992 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we have neglected the effects of rotation on the parker instability .",
    "although the effects of differential rotation which occurs in accretion disks as well as galactic disks are difficult to work with analytically , those of rigid - body rotation can be included in the frame of the present work .",
    "the inclusion of rigid - body rotation is expected to have two major effects on our results .",
    "first , although it does not change the criterion of the instability , the inclusion of rigid - body rotation reduces the growth rate as already pointed in shu ( 1974 ) and zweibel & kulsrud ( 1975 ) .",
    "second , also as pointed in shu ( 1974 ) , with rigid - body rotation the lindblad oscillation enters to the problem making the classification , for instance the one in figure 10 , more complicated .",

    "the mhd equations for gas with cosmic - rays are given by @xmath150 @xmath151 @xmath152 @xmath153 @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the cosmic ray pressure .",
    "for cosmic - rays we use the equation which was employed in the study of the effect of rotation on the parker instability by shu ( 1974 ) .",
    "it is valid on the assumption that cosmic - rays adjust themselves to flows with an infinite speed along magnetic field lines .",
    "if the detail dynamics of cosmic - rays is important , for instance , around the shocks where they are accelerated , it can be treated either by the diffusion - advection equation such as derived by skilling ( 1975 ) or by the two - fluid model ( drury & vlk 1981 ) . in the two - fluid model , cosmic - rays",
    "are represented by a fluid with an adiabatic index between 4/3 and 5/3 . with these more realistic treatments of cosmic - rays",
    ", it was shown that fluids with cosmic - rays are subject to cosmic - ray induced instabilities with a scale comparable to the diffusion length of cosmic - rays ( see ,  drury & falle 1986 ; zank , axford , & mckenzie 1990 ; kang , jones , & ryu 1992 ; ryu , kang , & jones 1993 ; begelman & zweibel 1994 ) .",
    "however , since here we are interested in the parker instability which occurs in a much larger scale mainly by the coupling of magnetic field with gravity , the above simpler equation for cosmic - rays should be enough .    to describe the local behavior of the parker instability in magnetized disks , we introduce cartesian coordinates @xmath156 whose directions are radial , azimuthal and vertical , respectively .",
