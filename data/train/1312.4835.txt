    "the presence of a large amount of dark matter ( dm ) in the universe is now supported by means of a numerous and converging astrophysical and cosmological probes .",
    "these probes allow to determine that the average , horizon - scale , dm contribution to the energy density of the universe is six times larger than the baryonic density . in a spatially flat @xmath0cdm scenario",
    "the dm energy density is about 25% of the critical density of the universe @xcite . on smaller scales ,",
    "the dm is observed to be distributed quite anisotropically : it forms a hierarchical network of cosmic structures , from the large - scale galaxy clusters down to the small - scale galaxies and their inner parts .",
    "this observational picture is consistent with the theoretical understanding of cosmic structure formation through gravitational instability , based on a dm component which is relatively cold .",
    "the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm , with cdm evolving in an expanding universe is able to reproduce the statistical properties of the large scale structure ( lss ) of the universe , and predicts a galaxy formation pattern which is consistent , at least to a large extent , to observations .",
    "although the common picture of cdm structure formation may be posed under discussion at very small scales , and even though the true role of baryons if the galaxy formation process has only recently started to be investigated , nevertheless the general picture of the lss formation is robust ( for recent reviews on the subject , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    the most common interpretation of the dm in the universe relies on the simple and quite natural paradigm of particle excitation in the hot early plasma , with subsequent decoupling and formation of a cosmological abundance of dm particles .",
    "cdm is then naturally explained in terms of relic particles which need to be relatively massive ( in order to be cold at decoupling ) and weakly interacting ( such that they freeze - out with the correct relic abundance ) . although alternative hypothesis are possible ( axions or axion - like particles , non - thermal or non - symmetric dm production ) the wimp mechanism offers a viable and natural solution to the presence of dm in the universe .",
    "dm evidence is currently of pure gravitational origin : galaxy - cluster dynamics , rotational curves of spiral galaxies , gravitational lensing observations , hydrodynamical equilibrium of hot gas in galaxy clusters , the same energy budget of the universe and the theory of structure formation , are all probes based on the gravitational effects induced by the presence of large amounts of dm .",
    "however , if dm is composed by elementary particles , vestiges of the early thermal phase , it is expected to produce also non - gravitational signals , specifically related to its particle - physics nature .",
    "a large number of astrophysical dm signals are currently explored : except for direct detection , which relies on the direct scattering of the dm particles with a low - background detector in an underground laboratory , all other foreseen signals are of indirect origin and rely on the products of annihilation ( or decay ) of the dm particle in the astrophysical environment , either galactic or extra - galactic .",
    "these indirect signals comprise charged galactic exotic cosmic - rays species ( electrons / positrons , antiprotons , antideuterons ) , the whole spectrum of electromagnetic emission ( from radio to gamma - rays ) and neutrinos .",
    "the indirect detection signals are intrinsically anisotropic , since they are produced by dm structures in the universe , and structures are present potentially at any scale : galaxy clusters on the largest scales , individual galaxies inside clusters , subhalos inside galaxies . especially electromagnetic signals , which more directly trace the distribution of the dm that produces them , are expected to exhibit some level of anisotropy .",
    "bright enough dm objects ( at any given wavelength ) would appear as resolved sources : an example could be a radio or gamma - ray halo surrounding and comprising a galaxy cluster or a single galaxy ( dwarf galaxies , being dm dominated objects , are interesting targets for this search ) or even galactic subhalos which could appear as isolated objects in the radio or gamma - rays sky ) .",
    "unresolved dm sources , i.e. with brightnesses below the detector sensitivity , produce instead a diffuse flux of photons which contains a subdominant level of anisotropy , due to the sum of a large number of faint sources related to the anisotropic dm distribution . in this case , the effect of anisotropies could be identified on a statistical basis , by means of studying observables related to angular correlations of the spatial map of the signal , the most typical and relevant one being the two - point angular power spectrum .",
    "we comment that also the diffuse neutrino signal would be endowed of the anisotropic feature , since neutrinos are necessarily produced in the same processes that lead also to prompt gamma - rays : however , the mechanisms of neutrino detection introduce a larger spatial uncertainty , as compared to photon detectors , and moreover the detection rates for neutrinos are significantly lower than for photons , due to the weak nature of neutrino interactions .",
    "indirect detection searches of the anisotropic dm sky can follow three directions : the study of anisotropies of a single electromagnetic signal , which represents an auto - correlation observable ; the cross - correlation of anisotropies in two different electromagnetic signals ; the cross - correlation of an electromagnetic signal with gravitational tracers of the dm distribution in the universe .",
    "the first option has already been attempted both for gamma - rays @xcite ( also on the data recently reported by the fermi collaboration  @xcite ) and for the radio signal @xcite ( for some discussions in the x - ray band , see @xcite ) .",
    "different wavelengths are emitted by dm through different physical mechanisms : gamma - rays may be promptly produced in the dm annihilation / decay event through production of mesons ( mostly neutral pions ) or baryons , which subsequently decay , or as final - state radiation of charged particles ; x - rays ( and gamma - rays ) are produced by inverse - compton scattering of the electrons / positrons produced by dm annihilation / decay on the interstellar radiation fields and on the cmb ; radio waves are due to synchrotron emission of the same electrons / positrons in the magnetic fields present in the cosmic structure where they are produced .",
    "the different electromagnetic signal therefore probe differently the astrophysical properties of the emitting dm structure .",
    "prompt gamma - ray emissions most directly retain the spatial features of the dm density field , while the radiative signals feel also the electrons / positrons spatial diffusion and energy loss , as well as the distribution of magnetic fields . on the other hand ,",
    "the angular resolution of gamma - rays detectors is lesser than the one accessible to radio ( and x - ray ) telescopes .",
    "each signal has therefore different features , and the possibility to exploit all types of signal can potentially help in extracting a true dm signal .",
    "let us notice here that the relative size of the electromagnetic emission at different wavelengths from dm particles , can significantly change depending on the particle dm properties .",
    "for example , a dm particle that can annihilate into hadrons , typically produces softer spectra both of gamma - rays and of electrons / positrons , as compared to leptonic annihilations : this reflects on the spectral features of both the prompt and radiative signals , and to some extent also on the spatial features of the radiative signal , since diffusion and energy losses of electrons / positrons depend on energy .",
    "similar arguments apply to the case of decaying dm .",
    "the spectral features then depend also on the dm mass , since non - relativistic annihilations ( or decays ) set an upper bound on the maximal accessible energy at the value of the dm mass ( or half the value of the dm mass for dm decay ) .",
    "all these features can then affect differently the relative size also of the auto - correlation signals .    the second possibility ,",
    "i.e. cross - correlation between different electromagnetic signal , has not yet been studied : by employing the signal coming at two different wavelengths , we can probe in an independent and richer way the different responses of a dm signal to the dm particle properties ( as discussed above ) , and to some extent also to the properties of the dm structures ( again , for the reasons discussed above on the way an electromagnetic signal is produced ) . in the following",
    "we will therefore discuss the potentialities for a dm signal in the different cross - correlation channels and try to quantify the mutual impact in the signal extraction .",
    "we will explicitly discuss radio - gamma , radio - x and x - gamma cross - correlations .",
    "the third option is potentially the most relevant one , since it attempts to directly correlate two distinctive features of particle dm : an electromagnetic signal , which is a typical and unambiguous manifestation of the dm being an elementary particle , from one side ; the direct probe of the existence of dm in the universe , which is seen through the gravitational effects induced by the presence of dm in the universe , on the other side .",
    "a positive signal in this cross - correlation channel would provide direct evidence that what is measured by means of gravitational probes is indeed due to dm in terms of an elementary particle and is not , e.g. , a manifestation of alternative theories of gravity .",
    "this third approach has been pioneered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the cross - correlation of the gamma - rays emission with the weak - lensing cosmic shear has been studied and shown to represent a viable and promising novel channel of investigation . in this paper",
    "we extend the cross - correlation studies to two additional gravitational probes : tracers of the large scale structure and the very recent observation of the cmb lensing signal .",
    "we also extend the analyses to comprise not only gamma - rays , but also the radio and x - rays emissions from dm , in order to establish the potentialities of the full range of possibilities .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the theory of extragalactic dm anisotropies .",
    "we discuss the features , sizes and comparisons of the various auto- and cross - correlation signals in the anisotropic sky , for dm annihilations and decays and looking into the whole electromagnetic spectrum , with the aim of exploring the full range of possible signals and correlations , and of setting the ground for future analyses .",
    "first , we will carefully outline the formalism needed to perform computations of extragalactic dm anisotropies .",
    "we then review some channels already discussed in the literature ( gamma - rays autocorrelations , radio autocorrelations and gamma rays / cosmic shear cross - correlation ) , and extend the range of investigation to propose new channels : for the signals related to the particle physics nature of dm , we explicitly discuss the auto- and mutual cross - correlations in the whole electromagnetic spectrum , by adding to the study the gamma / radio case and the auto- and cross - correlation signals involving x - rays ; for the signals able to correlate the gravitational probes of dm in the universe to the particle - physics ability to produce photon fluxes , we extend the idea to investigate the gamma - rays / cosmic - shear correlation , originally proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , to further adopt radio and x - rays emissions from one side , and to embrace large - scale - structure tracers @xcite and cmb lensing from the other side .",
    "a second step of this complex type of analysis will be a detailed study of the different , various and intricate astrophysical emitters at the different wavelengths ( like active galactic nuclei , star forming galaxies , etc . ) which also contribute to the anisotropic sky and represent the background over which the signal we are discussing have to be confronted , as well as an accurate assessment of the observational capabilities .",
    "we leave these parts of the analysis to future works .",
    "the paper starts with a review of the general formalism apt to derive the two - point angular power spectrum of correlation signals , and details the steps relevant for studying both dm annihilation ( which depends on the square of the dm density field ) and dm decay ( which instead depends linearly on the dm density ) cases . then discusses the features of the relevant ingredients which enter the correlation signal : the three - dimensional power spectrum , both for the auto- and cross - correlation , and the window functions for each electromagnetic and gravitational signal .",
    "angular power spectrum predictions are then shown and discussed for all types of correlations signals : auto correlations in the radio , x and gamma - rays bands ; cross - correlations among them ; cross - correlations between the radio or gamma - rays emission and the gravitational probes ( cosmic shear , cmb lensing , lss observables ) .",
    "results will be presented for benchmark cases and for both annihilating and decaying dm .",
    "in this section we review the general formalism to derive the angular power spectrum of the auto- and cross - correlation of any given pair of intensity fields , which in our analysis are given by the radio , x - ray , gamma - ray dm fluxes , or the cosmic shear , lss , cmb - lensing maps .",
    "the source intensity @xmath1 along a given direction @xmath2 can be written as : i_g ( n ) = d g(,n)w ( ) [ eq : int ] where @xmath3 denotes the radial comoving distance ( function of the redshift @xmath4 ) , @xmath5 is the density field of the source , and @xmath6 is the window function ( which is function of the distance but does not depend on the specific direction @xmath2 ) .",
    "we can also define a normalized version of the window function as @xmath7 , such that the average intensity is obtained by integration of the normalized window function along the distance : @xmath8 .",
    "the window function brings the information on how the actual observable related of the signal under study is distributed in redshift .",
    "it will act as a weight for the different redshift contributions of the 3d power spectrum when computing the angular power spectrum .",
    "its specific form varies depending on whether we are studying the cosmological emission of an electromagnetic signal from dm annihilation ( or decay ) , or instead the images of background galaxies ( which are lensed by the structures ) in the case of cosmic shear , or the cmb flux at the large scattering surface in the case of cmb lensing , or the distribution of astrophysical sources and of their light emission ( typically in the visible , infrared or radio wavelength ) in the case of lss tracers .",
    "the specific form of @xmath9 for all the cases under study will be reported in a dedicated section below .    by defining the intensity fluctuation as @xmath10 and expanding the fluctuation field in terms of spherical harmonics , @xmath11 , the ( dimensionless ) @xmath12 coefficients",

    "thus using @xmath49 , we finally arrive at the decomposition of the 3d power - spectrum into the one - halo and two - halo terms : p_ij(k ) = p_ij^1h(k ) + p_ij^2h(k ) where : p_ij^1h(k ) & = & dm   f_i^(k|m)f_j(k|m ) [ eq : ps1halo ] + p_ij^2h(k ) & = & p^lin(k)[eq : ps2halo ] notice that the average @xmath50 of the density field of the source is given by : |g(z)=g(z , n ) = dmd^3x  g(x|m , z ) , [ eq : gave ] which implies that at small @xmath51 ( where @xmath52 ) the terms in the square - brackets in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ps2halo ] ) are of order 1 ( except in the case of a significant bias ) .",
    "the 2-halo term is thus normalized to the standard linear matter ps at small @xmath51 , which motivates the normalization of the window function introduced above .    in principle , instead of adopting the above halo - model formalism , one could directly take the results from n - body simulations , generate the corresponding maps of the emissions and then extract the angular power spectrum .",
    "on the other hand , the small scales are currently not covered by simulations and in order to make a realistic prediction of the signal ( in particular in the annihilating dm scenario ) one has to introduce some prescription to include them .",
    "results based on simulations only ( without the introduction of small scales ) can be significantly biased .",
    "the halo - model approach is instead based on tuning three - functions ( describing the number of halos @xmath53 , the mass concentration of halos @xmath54 , and the halo profile @xmath55 ) to the simulation results , where they exist , and defining some appropriate extrapolations in the unsampled regime .",
    "the computation is therefore quite neat once those functions have been drawn , and allows for an easier physical insight .",
    "since it is probably unlikely that n - body simulations will cover scales corresponding to the wimp free - streaming mass in the forthcoming years , such a phenomenological approach will remain a prime way to compute the wimp angular ps .",
    "the next step is to explicitly derive the three - dimensional power spectra , defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pss ] ) , for the different cases of auto - correlation and cross - correlation involving particle dm signals .",
    "this requires to adopt , for each specific case , the appropriate intensity - field function @xmath56 .",
    "we will only consider a dm source with a spatial profile directly tracing the dm density profile ( or its square in the annihilating scenario ) .",
    "this is typically the case for prompt emission of gamma - rays , while for the radio emission , and for the x - ray or gamma - ray signal produced by inverse compton processes , the radiative emissions associated to electrons and positrons injected by dm can have a different shape either because of the spatial profile of the fields of interaction ( the magnetic field for the synchrotron emission which produces the radio signal ; the radiation fields , like cmb or starlight , which are responsible for the x - ray , or also gamma - rays , production through inverse compton scattering ; both fields contribute to energy losses ) , or because of the diffusion of @xmath57 before emission . in this case",
    "the density field of the emission is no longer proportional to the dm density ( or its square ) and has to be accordingly modified .",
    "this modification typically affects only anisotropies on very small scales ( see the full formalism in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and , for simplicity , will be neglected here except for some approximate estimate in the case of the radio emission .      in the cases of lensing and decaying dm , the density field of the source",
    "is directly given by the density distribution @xmath58 : @xmath59 , and therefore @xmath60 , where the @xmath61 is the density contrast .",

    "the x - ray flux instead arises from inverse compton ( ic ) of the same electrons and positrons on the cmb , with ensuing up - scatter of the cmb photons .",

    "the reference frequencies are : @xmath131 ghz for radio , @xmath94 kev for x - rays , @xmath95 gev for gamma - rays .",
    "the plot shows that a multi - wavelength approach can be quite powerful .",
    "indeed , the different emissions exhibit rather different window functions : each one therefore can provide different and complementary information . in particular , the radio case is more peaked at low redshift , while the x - ray window function has a flatter shape , with the gamma - ray case being somewhat in between .",
    "this is due to the fact that the cmb becomes much more dense in the past ( the photon energy - density goes with the well known @xmath132 scaling ) , making the energy losses for ic very effective at higher redshifts : this depletes the radio signal at high @xmath4 , while , in the x - ray case , the corresponding increase of the ic emissivity compensates the effect .",
    "we also notice that the decaying and annihilating dm cases produce very similar window functions for radio emission , while for x - rays and gamma - rays the window function is flatter in the annihilating case as compared to the decaying case .",
    "this occurs because of the effect of clustering , which enhances the signal at larger redshifts .",
    "the window functions for weak - lensing shear ( des and euclid populations ) , cmb lensing , and lss ( 2mass and nvss galaxy catalogs ) are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : winfun ] .",
    "they have quite different shapes , as a consequence of the different redshift evolution of the relevant tracers which produce the observed signal . since the cross - correlation power spectrum depends on the overlap of the window functions of the two correlated signals , as is shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : clfin ] ) , the different gravitational tracers will be more / less efficient in the cross - correlation with particle dm signals . comparing the two panels of fig .  [",
    "fig : winfun ] allows to understand which cross - correlation combinations could be optimal ( although experimental limitations may occur , like limited statistics in one observational channel or angular resolutions ) .",
    "notice that 2mass and nvss are sort of two opposite limits for galaxy tracers ( and this is the why we choose these examples ) : 2mass coverage peaks at very low - redshifts , below 0.2 , while nvss has a broad redshift distribution .",
    "the weak - lensing shear is peaked at intermediate - low redshift , which makes this observables a good candidate for cross - correlation with particle dm signals , as proposed in  ref .",
    "the cmb window function instead extends over a very wide range of redshift ( in principle , up to the last scattering ) : this is also why it appears significantly lower , as compared to the other cases in fig . [",

    "we also normalize all the angular ps to the total averaged intensity , as reported in eq .",
    "( [ eq : clfin ] ) , in order to make the various cases more easily comparable .",

    "[ fig : corr1],[fig : corr2],[fig : corr3 ] , while the decaying cases are reported in the right panels of the same figures . fig .",
    "[ fig : corr1 ] shows the auto- and cross - correlations of the electromagnetic signals .",
    "the most anisotropic cases involve the radio emission .",
    "this is because the radio window function is peaked at low - redshift : the signal therefore comes from a relatively low number of halos and thus is quite anisotropic .",
    "the flatter window function of x - rays implies that in this case the number of objects contributing to the intensity field is larger , thus making the emission smoother and the ensuing ps smaller .",
    "the gamma - rays case is intermediate to radio and x - rays : as shown by its window function in fig .",
    "[ fig : winfun ] , the gamma - rays emission is peaked at low - to - intermediate redshifts and this implies a relatively larger anisotropy in the intensity , as compared to x - rays .",
    "we also notice that the radio ps flattens more rapidly at @xmath134 with respect to gamma and x - ray ps .",
    "the 1-halo term takes over at large multipoles and leads to constant @xmath135 ( poisson - noise ) when sources are point - like , while instead it leads to a decreasing @xmath135 when structures start to be resolved .",
    "the flattening is therefore again related to the redshift distribution .",
    "indeed the inner structure of closer objects , which are more important in the radio case , is resolved at larger angular scale with respect to more distant objects which contribute to the bulk of the emission in the gamma and x - ray cases .",
    "we finally notice that at small angular scales , annihilating dm provides much more anisotropy as compared to decaying dm , due to its dependence on @xmath115 and to the subhalo scheme adopted .",
    "as mentioned above , we are taking an approximate description for radiative emissions ( both ic and synchrotron ) where all the power is radiated at the same place of @xmath57 injection , and therefore the density field of the emission is proportional to the dm density ( for decaying dm ) or dm density squared ( for annihilating dm ) .",
    "one of the neglected effects is the diffusion of @xmath57 , which might lead to a smoothing of the cuspy behaviour of the density profile into a more cored profile ( for a more extended discussion on the impact of this approximation on radio anisotropies , see ref .",
    "if we still assume that all the power is radiated within the object , we can model the effect of diffusion on the final @xmath57 distribution by replacing the nfw profile @xmath136 ( where @xmath137 and @xmath138 is the scale radius ) with a cored density , like e.g. , @xmath139 .",
    "the thick and thin dotted lines in the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : corr1 ] show the case with an nfw and cored distribution , respectively .",
    "the difference is not dramatic ( notice that this can also be seen as an estimate for the case where the dm distribution itself is cored , although the power spectrum we have been using is based on results of n - body simulations , thus fully consistent only with a cuspy profile ) .    summarizing the behavior of the auto- and cross - correlation power spectra of the electromagnetic signals among themselves",
    ", we can state that the radio emission exhibits the strongest anisotropy , both among the auto - correlation signals and in combination with the other emissions .",
    "there are almost two orders of magnitude between the radio / radio auto - correlation signal as compared to the x - rays / x - rays auto - correlation ( which exhibit also the smallest among all the correlations of electromagnetic signals ) and one order of magnitude larger than the gamma / gamma autocorrelation .",
    "interesting prospects are present for the cross - correlation radio / gamma , which is a factor of 3 - 5 larger than the gamma / gamma case .",
    "these general features occur both for the annihilating and decaying dm signals , with more power at large multipoles for annihilating dm as compared to the decaying case , and with slightly more separation among the different cases again for annihilating dm as compared to decaying dm .",
    "since we are dealing here with angular power spectra normalized to the average intensity , the actual feasibility of detection will depend also on the absolute normalization level accessible by the different detectors , which is detector specific .",
    "being concerned in this paper with the theoretical properties of the auto- and cross - correlation signals and with the assessment of their mutual impact , we are not adopting here any specific experimental figure of merit : results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr1],[fig : corr2],[fig : corr3 ] can then be folded with the individual detector capabilities .",
    "in fact , the experimental ability to disentangle an anisotropy signal will also depend on the specific features of the detectors and on the astrophysical backgrounds , which also produce an anisotropic electromagnetic emission .",
    "photon detectors at different wavelengths have intrinsically different angular resolution : e.g. radio telescopes can resolve very fine details , and have an angular resolution which is much better than gamma - rays detectors .",
    "they will therefore be a suitable instrument for studying large multipoles @xmath140 .",
    "on the other hand , at lower multipoles gamma - rays detector may be more suitable than interferometric radio telescopes .",
    "the combination of the information coming from the auto - correlation signal at different wavelengths , as well as cross - correlations of different signals , may therefore be a relevant tool to identify and characterize a dm signal .",

    "<S> anisotropies in the electromagnetic emission produced by dark matter annihilation or decay in the extragalactic sky are a recent tool in the quest for a particle dark matter evidence . </S>",
    "<S> we review the formalism to compute the two - point angular power spectrum in the halo - model approach and discuss the features and the relative size of the various auto- and cross - correlation signals that can be envisaged for anisotropy studies . from the side of particle dark matter signals , we consider the full multi - wavelength spectrum , from the radio emission to x - ray and gamma - ray productions . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the angular power spectra of the auto - correlation of each of these signals and of the cross - correlation between any pair of them . </S>",
    "<S> we then extend the search to comprise specific gravitational tracers of dark matter distribution in the universe : weak - lensing cosmic shear , large - scale - structure matter distribution and cmb - lensing . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that cross - correlating a multi - wavelength dark matter signal ( which is a direct manifestation of its particle physics nature ) with a gravitational tracer ( which is a manifestation of the presence of large amounts of unseen matter in the universe ) may offer a promising tool to demonstrate that what we call dm is indeed formed by elementary particles . </S>"
