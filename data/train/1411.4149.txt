    "white dwarf stars are the end product of evolution of all stars with progenitor masses below 810.5  @xmath2 , depending on metallicity @xcite .",
    "the first full white dwarf catalogue from sloan digital sky survey data @xcite was based on sdss data release 1 ( dr1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . using data from the sdss data release 4 ( dr4 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite reported over 9000 spectroscopically - confirmed white dwarfs stars . in the latest white dwarf catalogue based on the sdss data release  7 , ( dr7 , * ? ? ? * ) classified the spectra of 19713 white dwarf stars , of which 12831 were hydrogen atmosphere white dwarf stars ( das ) and 922 helium atmosphere white dwarf stars ( dbs ) , including the ( re)analysis of stars from previous releases .    the sdss data massively increased the number of known white dwarfs , which had an enormous impact on the knowledge of these stars .",
    "however , target selection considerations of the original sdss implied that white dwarf selection for spectroscopy was incomplete .",
    "white dwarf stars were targeted in sdss - iii s @xcite baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) by the ancillary project white dwarf and hot subdwarfs @xcite . by dr10",
    "the ancillary target programme obtained the spectra of @xmath3 colour selected white dwarf candidates that were missed by prior sdss spectroscopic surveys . here",
    ", we report on our full search for new white dwarfs from the sdss data release 10 @xcite .",
    "our catalogue does not include stars from the earlier catalogues .",
    "sdss multi - colour imaging separates hot white dwarf and subdwarf stars from the bulk of the stellar and quasar loci in colour - colour space @xcite .",
    "special target classes in sdss produced the world s largest spectroscopic samples of white dwarfs .",
    "however , much of sdss white dwarf targeting required that the objects be unblended , which caused many brighter white dwarfs to be skipped ( for a detailed discussion , see section 5.6 of eisenstein et al .",
    "2006 ) . the boss ancillary targeting programme @xcite relaxed this requirement and imposed colour cuts to focus on warm and hot white dwarfs .",
    "importantly , the boss spectral range extends further into the uv , allowing full coverage of the balmer lines .",
    "the targeted white dwarfs were required to be point sources with clean photometry , and to have usno - b catalog counterparts @xcite .",
    "they were also restricted to regions inside the dr7 imaging footprint and required to have colours within the ranges @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and to have low galactic extinction @xmath8  mag .",
    "additionally , targets that did not have @xmath9 and @xmath10 were required to have usno proper motions larger than 2 arcsec per century .",
    "objects satisfying the selection criteria that had not been observed previously by the sdss were denoted by the whitedwarf_new target flag , while those with prior sdss spectra are assigned the whitedwarf_sdss flag .",
    "some of the latter were re - observed with boss in order to obtain the extended wavelength coverage that the boss spectrograph offers .",
    "the colour selection used includes da stars with temperatures above @xmath11  k , helium atmosphere white dwarfs above @xmath12  k , as well as many rarer classes of white dwarfs . hot subdwarfs ( sdb and sdo ) were targeted as well .",
    "sdss - iii boss @xcite optical spectra extends from 3610    to 10140   , with spectral resolution 1560 - 2270 in the blue channel , and 1850 - 2650 in the red channel @xcite .",
    "the data were reduced by the spectroscopic reduction pipeline of @xcite .",
    "in addition to the 3104 targeted new white dwarf candidates , we selected the spectra of any object classified by the elodie pipeline @xcite as a white dwarf , which returned 27372 spectra .",
    "our general colour selection from @xcite returned 265633 spectra of which 42154 had already been examined in @xcite . from these , we examined the spectra of additional @xmath13 with @xmath14 and no quasi stellar object ( qso ) flag . on top of those",
    ", we analyzed another 35000 spectra selected on the sdss 3358200 optical spectra reported by dr10 with an automated search algorithm loosely based on @xcite , estimating local averages at 75 pre - selected wavelengths sampling white dwarf strong lines , and found another 1010 stars .",
    "of the @xmath3 objects targeted specifically as new white dwarf spectra by boss as an ancillary programme , 574 were not identified as white dwarfs or subdwarfs by us . from the total inspected by eye , around 37% of the selected spectra",
    "are in fact confirmed white dwarfs , of which 20% were already known .",
    "@xcite reported 47% of their colour selected sample are white dwarf stars .",
    "of the ancillary program 43 of whitedwarf_sdss already observed , 157 in 2432 colour selected stars are in fact quasars .",
    "these fractions must be considered when using samples of photometrically selected white dwarfs , for example , to calculate luminosity functions .",
    "we applied automated selection techniques supplemented by complete , consistent human identifications of each candidate white dwarf spectrum .",
    "after visual identification of the spectra as a probable white dwarf , we first fitted the optical spectra to da and db local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) grids of synthetic non - magnetic spectra derived from model atmospheres @xcite .",
    "the da model grid uses the ml2@xmath15 approximation , and for the dbs we use the ml2/@xmath16 approximation , to be consistent with @xcite .",
    "our da grid extends up to @xmath17  k , considering @xcite concluded pure hydrogen atmospheres of da white dwarfs are well represented by lte calculations for effective temperatures up to 80000  k. only when traces of helium are present , non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) effects on the balmer lines occur , down to effective temperatures of 40000  k , recommending the neglect of traces of helium in the lte models for the analysis of da white dwarfs .",
    "we fitted all candidate white dwarf spectra and colours with the autofit code described in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "autofit fits only clean da and db models , so it does not recognize other types of white dwarf stars .",
    "in addition to the best fitting model parameters , it also outputs a goodness of fit estimate and several quality control checks and flags for other features noted in the spectrum or fit .",
    "the automatic fits include sdss imaging photometry and allow for refluxing of the models by a low - order polynomial to incorporate effects of unknown reddening and spectrophotometric flux calibration errors .",
    "in addition , we have also fitted the spectral lines and photometry separately @xcite , selecting between the hot and cool solutions using photometry as an indicator .",
    "we make use of the latest sdss reductions for photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "the white dwarf model atmospheres in our autofit spectral fits , providing reliable @xmath18 and @xmath1 determinations for each identified clean da and db are the same used in @xcite .",
    "we use the word _",
    "clean _ to identify spectra that show only features of non - magnetic , non - mixed , da or db ( and dba ) stars .",
    "we did not further restrict our sample by magnitude .",
    "the sdss spectra we classified as white dwarfs or subdwarfs have a g - band signal  to  noise ratio @xmath19 , with an average of 15 .",
    "the lowest s / n in the g - band occurs for stars cooler than @xmath20  k , but they have significant s / n in the red part of the spectrum .      because we are interested in obtaining accurate mass distributions for our da and db stars , we were conservative in labelling a spectrum as a clean da or db , adding additional subtypes and uncertainty notations if we saw signs of other elements , companions , or magnetic fields in the spectra . while some of our mixed white dwarf subtypes would probably be identified as clean das or dbs with better signal - to - noise spectra , few of our identified clean das or dbs",
    "would likely be found to have additional spectral features within our detection limit .",
    "we looked for the following features to aid in the classification for each specified white dwarf subtype :    * balmer lines  normally broad and with a balmer decrement [ da but also dab , dba , dza , and subdwarfs ] * hei @xmath21  [ db , subdwarfs ] * heii @xmath22  [ do , pg1159 , subdwarfs ] * c2 swan band or atomic ci lines [ dq ] * caii h & k [ dz , daz ] * cii @xmath23  [ hotdq ] * zeeman splitting [ magnetic white dwarfs ] * featureless spectrum with significant proper motion [ dc ] * flux increasing in the red [ binary , most probably m companion ] * oi @xmath24  [ dox ]    we also found a group of stars to have a very steep balmer decrement ( i.e. only a broad h@xmath25 and sometimes h@xmath26 is observed while the other lines are absent ) that could not be fit with a pure hydrogen grid , or indicated extremely high gravities .",
    "we find that these objects are best explained as helium - rich das , and denote them da - he .",
    "we finally note that the white dwarf colour space also contains many hot subdwarfs .",
    "it is difficult , just by looking at a spectrum , to tell a low mass white dwarf from a subdwarf , as they are both dominated by hydrogen lines and the small differences in surface gravity can not be spotted by visual inspection alone .",
    "we therefore extended the model grid to @xmath27 to separate white dwarfs , hot subdwarfs and main sequence stars ( see section [ section : masses ] and [ section : sub ] ) , but the differences in the line widths for das cooler than @xmath28  k and hotter than @xmath29  k are minor with changing gravity .",

    "> , < \" , ]",
    "we have identified @xmath0 new white dwarf and subdwarf stars in the dr 10 of the sdss , and estimated the mean masses for das and dbs , as well as the calcium contamination in dzs and carbon in dqs .",
    "we were able to extend our identifications down to @xmath30  k , although certainly not complete , as we relied also on proper motion measurements , which are incomplete below @xmath31 .",
    "the substantial increase in the number of spectroscopically confirmed white dwarfs is important because it allows the discovery of the rare objects , like the massive white dwarfs and oxygen spectrum over helium dominated atmosphere ones .",
    "the improvements in the signal to noise and spectral coverage of boss spectra versus the sdss spectrograph also allowed for improvements in the stellar parameters , though systematic effects mainly due to flux calibration must be explored .",
