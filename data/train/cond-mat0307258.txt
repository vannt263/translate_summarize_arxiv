    "a recent electronic analog of the hanbury brown - twiss photon - effect experiment samuelsson and bttiker  @xcite  strongly suggest electron pairs in a normal / superconductor junction to be bosons , although further work seems needed to provide compelling empirical proof . on the other hand ,",
    "assuming cooper pairs ( cps ) to be bosons , it was recently proved @xcite within a generalized bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) model that includes the bcs - bose crossover theory @xcite-@xcite as a special case , that a bcs condensate is precisely a bose - einstein ( be ) condensate consisting of equal numbers of particle- and hole - cps , at least for the cooper / bcs @xcite  model interfermion interaction in the limit of weak coupling when the crossover picture reduces to bcs theory .",
    "this is significant since bcs argued ( ref .",
    "@xcite , footnote 18 ) that `` _ _ our transition is not analogous to a bose - einstein condensation _ _ ( bec ) . '' somewhat later , bardeen wrote @xcite that `` _ _ ... the picture by schafroth ( 1955) ... of electron pairs ... which at low temperature undergo a bec , is not valid . _",
    "_ '' in contrast , both feynman @xciteand josephson @xcite  referred without proof to cps  as bosons .",
    "on the other hand , a long - standing common objection to attempts tolma , pla2,cmt02,dellrev to unify bcs and bec theories for a description of _ superconductivity _ has been that cps , strictly speaking , can not be considered bosons . in this letter",
    "we establish a clear distinction between bcs pairs and cps , showing that while the former are not bosons the latter very definitely are , at least insofar as they obey be statistics . the distinction , though elementary , is hardly if ever mentioned in the superconductivity literature , though it appears not to be as unacceptable among the neutral - fermion _ superfluidity _ community where it is also applied , albeit with a different interfermion interaction , to the bcs and cooper pairs as in liquid @xmath0he @xcite and in ultracold trapped alkali fermi gases such as @xmath1k @xcite and @xmath2li @xcite .",
    "recent studies @xcite-@xcite have also appearedaddressing superfluidity in degenerate fermi gases .",
    "indeed , a be - like condensate of dimers formed from neutral @xmath1k  @xcite  or @xmath2li @xcite-@xcite fermionic atoms via magnetically - tunable `` feshbach resonances '' has only recently finally been observed .",
    "the original or ordinary cps @xcite emerge by solving a schrdinger - like equation in momentum space for two _ particles _ above the ideal - fermi - gas ( ifg ) sea of the remaining @xmath3 system fermions . if two - hole pairs are also included",
    ", the extended cooper eigenvalue equation yields @xcite@xcite  purely imaginary values .",
    "this precludes defining cps relative to an ifg sea .",
    "however , a more both general and self - consistent treatment starts with an unperturbed hamiltonian representing not the fermi sea but bcs - correlated ground state in the bethe - salpeter ( bs )  integral equations _ with _ hole propagation .",
    "when solved @xcite-@xcite  in the ladder approximation for bound two - particle and two - hole states , non - purely - imaginary eigenvalues are restored for what has been called the `` moving cp '' solution of the bs equations .",
    "the bs results in 3d @xcite , 2d @xcite , and 1d 1d  are consistent with each other , as expected .    unlike the fermi - atom case , the interfermionic interactions in ( especially cuprate ) superconductors are a deep , problematic and highly controversial issue @xcite-@xcite .",
    "so , we confine ourselves to an electron gas interacting pairwise via the ingeniously simple cooper / bcs model interfermion interaction @xcite @xmath4where @xmath5 is the double fourier transform of @xmath6 the ( possibly nonlocal ) interaction in @xmath7-dimensional coordinate space , with @xmath8 the relative coordinate of the two electrons .",
    "here @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the maximum energy of a phonon associated with the vibrating ionic lattice underlying the electron gas , while @xmath11 is the fermi energy and @xmath12 is the effective electron mass . in ref .",
    "@xcite there are no hole pairs ( viz . , below @xmath13 )  so the lower limit in ( [ bcsint ] ) was @xmath14 , while in ref .",
    "@xcite it is @xmath15 . in the simpler cooper case",
    "it means that two electrons with momentum wavevectors @xmath16 and @xmath17  interact with a constant net attraction @xmath18 when the tip of    -space ( shading ) where the tip of the relative pair wavevector @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 must point for the attractive cooper / bcs model interaction ( [ bcsint ] ) to be nonzero for a pair of total ( or center - of - mass ) momentum @xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "the tail of @xmath19 is at the midpoint of @xmath24 . ]",
    "their relative - momentum wavevector @xmath25 points anywhere inside the shaded overlap volume in @xmath26-space of the two spherical shells in fig . 1 whose center - to - center separation is @xmath27 , the total ( or center - of - mass ) momentum wavevector for the pair .  otherwise , there is no interaction and hence no pairing . for neutral - fermion systems",
    "there is no cutoff @xmath28 and @xmath29 is _ not _ constant in @xmath19 and @xmath30 , except when the interaction range is much shorter than the average fermion spacing as in a trapped fermi gas where it has become customary to employ contact ( or @xmath31 ) interactions .",
    "such are a special case of the more general finite - ranged , separable interaction , as is ( [ bcsint ] ) , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , and for which the conclusions below will continue to apply .",
    "vectors @xmath19  ending at all points of a simple - cubic lattice in @xmath26-space  ( in the 3d case ) with lattice spacing @xmath32 with @xmath33 the system size , ensure that the interaction ( [ bcsint ] )  is nonzero provided such points are in the shaded overlap volume of figure 1 .",
    "the endpoints of two vectors @xmath19  and @xmath30  are illustrated in figure 2 . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "there are infinitely many acceptable @xmath34  values allowed for each fixed value of @xmath24 for the @xmath35 cp eigenvalue equation @xcite@xcite with interaction ( [ bcsint ] ) , namely @xmath36    and @xmath37 ( dashed lines ) whose tips are within the overlap volume of figure 1 .",
    "they contribute to the summation in ( [ cpkeqn ] ) or to the integral in ( [ mcp ] ) to determine a cp energy @xmath38 .",
    "this illustrates why the @xmath39 term for bcs pairs in ( bb+ ) is _ always _ zero for cps , with the pauli principle being strictly satisfied . ]",
    "the prime on the summation sign signifies the restrictions in ( [ bcsint ] ) using @xmath14 as lower limit . for cps consisting of equal and opposite momentum electrons @xmath40 , solving ( [ cpkeqn ] )",

    "{ d}e^{-2/\\lambda }   \\label{coopere}\\]]where @xmath43 with @xmath44 the density of electronic states at the fermi energy .",
    "the first expression for @xmath45 is exact for all values @xmath46 in 2d [ where @xmath47 is constant ] and is otherwise a good approximation if @xmath48 as occurs in metals .  if hole cps are included in the bs scheme along with electron cps as in ( [ cpkeqn ] ) and ( [ coopere ] ) , instead of ( coopere ) one obtains the evidently unphysical purely - imaginary result@xmath49(see detailed treatment in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . replacing the ifg sea by the bcs ground - state sea , instead of ( [ cpkeqn ] )",
    "the eigenvalue equation for @xmath38 in 2d @xcite ( and a very similar one in 3d honolulu and in 1d @xcite ) is rather @xmath50where @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the angle between @xmath53 and @xmath19 , @xmath54 is defined by @xmath55 , @xmath56 with @xmath57 and@xmath58 is the electronic gap , while @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the usual bogoliubov functions @xcite .",
    "note that the lower limit in ( [ bcsint ] ) is being taken as @xmath61 as in bcs theory @xcite which does not exclude hole pairings .",
    "besides endowing cps with the physically expected _",
    "finite _ lifetimes , the more general bs treatment yields the nontrivial eigenvalue solution for @xmath40 given by @xmath62 , with @xmath63 @xmath64  @xmath65  the single - electron bcs energy gap , as opposed to the ordinary cp problem giving ( [ coopere ] ) .",
    "[ note the factor of two difference in the exponential compared with ( coopere ) due to excluding @xcite or not @xcite hole pairs . ]",
    "the nontrivial ( new ) bs solution governed by ( [ mcp ] )  has been called honolulu-@xcite a `` moving cp '' composite - boson excitation mode to distinguish it from another ( a trivial or known ) sound wave solution sometimes called the anderson - bogoliubov - higgs ( @xcite p. 44 ) , @xcite , @xcite excitation mode which in contrast with the moving cp mode vanishes as @xmath66 for any finite coupling , i.e. , is gapless , and is governed by another eigenvalue equation @xcite@xcitedifferent from ( [ mcp ] ) . in the pure boson gas , on the other hand , both `` particle '' and `` sound '' solutions are indistinguishable @xcite@xcite . in the fermion case of interest here",
    "it should be feasible to search for , identify and distinguish both particle and sound modes experimentally , e.g. , see ref .",
    "whether the pairwise interfermion interaction is between charge carriers or between neutral atoms , a cp state of energy @xmath38 ,  defined via eigenvalue equation ( [ cpkeqn ] ) or ( [ mcp ] ) ,  will clearly be characterized _ only by a definite _ @xmath24 but _ not _ definite @xmath19 . although elementary , this is our main point .",
    "it contrasts with that of a `` bcs pair '' defined as a dimer with fixed  @xmath53 and @xmath19 ( or equivalently fixed @xmath67  and @xmath68 ) , even though only the case @xmath69 is considered in ref .",

    ". it also applies to the generalized bs cps defined  more consistently without excluding two - hole pairs when the lower limit in ( [ bcsint ] ) is taken as @xmath61 as in bcs theory @xcite .",
    "the bcs - pair annihilation and creation operators for any @xmath83 @xmath84 can be defined quite generally as @xmath85where @xmath80  and @xmath76 obey ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 3a ] ) , and  as before @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the relative and total ( or center - of - mass ) momentum wavevectors , respectively , associated with two fermions with wavevectors @xmath88using the same techniques to derive ( [ bb+0 ] ) to ( [ pseudofermion0 ] ) valid for @xmath69 , the operators @xmath89 and @xmath90 are found  to satisfy : a ) the `` pseudo - boson '' commutation relations @xmath91 = ( 1-n_{\\mathbf{k}/2-\\mathbf{k}\\downarrow } -n_{\\mathbf{k}/2+\\mathbf{k}% \\uparrow } ) \\delta _ { \\mathbf{kk}^{\\prime } }   \\label{bb+}\\]]@xmath92 = \\left [ b_{\\mathbf{kk}},b_{\\mathbf{k}^{\\prime } \\mathbf{k}}\\right ] = 0 \\label{bb}\\]]where @xmath93 are fermion number operators ; as well as b ) a `` pseudo - fermion '' anti - commutation relation @xmath94our only restriction was that @xmath95 .",

    "so , neither bcs pairs with @xmath98 @xmath84  are _ _",
    "_ _ bosons as the relation ( [ bb+ ] ) contains additional terms not schrieffer64  present in the the usual boson commutation relations analogous to ( [ bosecomm ] ) .    to our knowledge",

    "@xcite in a generalized bec theory that contains bcs theory as a special case .",
    "this postulation is grounded in magnetic - flux quantization experiments  classical-@xcite that establish the presence of charged pairs  albeit without being able @xcite  to specify the _ sign _ of those charges .  however , although the eigenvalues of @xmath100 are @xmath84 or @xmath101 in keeping with the pauli exclusion principle , those of @xmath102 are evidently @xmath103 because of the indefinitely many values taken on by the summation index @xmath104 this implies be statistics and corroborates the qualitative conclusions reached above .",
    "a discussion in greater detail of this is found in refs . @xcite@xcite .",
    "in conclusion , in the thermodynamic limit _ any _ number of cps with a definite total ( or center - of - mass ) wavevector @xmath24 can occupy a _",

    "hence , cps can undergo a bec .",
    "all this holds for _ any _ coupling , i.e. , regardless of the size of the cps and of their mutual overlap .",
    "as in liquid @xmath105he ,  the bec statistical mechanism may serve as a starting point  even before the effects of interboson interactions ( excluded also in bcs theory ) are accounted @xcite  for  in constructing a microscopic theory of superconductivity , or of neutral - fermion superfluidity , that will eventually lead to @xmath106 values calculated from first principles  without adjustable parameters  and that hopefully  agree with observed ones .",
