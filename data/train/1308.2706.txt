    "recently , space - time with anisotropic scaling has become a popular subject in theoretical and mathematical physics .",
    "largely , this is due to the influential paper by hoava @xcite where a candidate for the possible uv completion of quantum gravity was suggested .",
    "this work is a non - trivial development of lifshitz earlier idea @xcite ( hence the common name for this type of models - hoava - lifshitz ( hl ) models ) .",
    "since then the area has attracted considerable attention .",
    "the developments have been along several different directions : study of the possible experimental consequences , theoretical study of the structure of the model , different generalizations etc .",
    "for some recent reviews , see @xcite .",
    "our interest in hl model lies in the detailed study of this model from the point of view of spectral ( or non - commutative geometry ) @xcite .",
    "the possible advantages of this approach were discussed in @xcite where one of the first steps in this direction had been made .",
    "namely , in @xcite we calculated the spectral dimension of the hl model of arbitrary curvature using the methods of spectral geometry .",
    "the result was in complete agreement with the earlier calculation for the flat case @xcite . to perform this analysis , we introduced a notion of a generalized laplacian , which is an appropriate generalization of the usual laplacian on a manifold .",
    "this modification is needed to incorporate the information about the anisotropic scaling .",
    "this generalized laplacian ( or its counterpart in the form of a generalized dirac operator ) is one of the main ingredients in the spectral approach to the hl gravity .",
    "this is due to a couple of reasons :    \\1 ) it is well known that the information about the usual commutative geometry can be extracted from the so - called spectral triple @xcite .",
    "dirac operator is an essential component of this triple ( the other two being the algebra of functions and the hilbert space of spinors ) . in the same way",
    ", we can construct generalized geometries by using the generalized spectral triples . in the case of the hl models , what is really modified is _ physical _ geometry , i.e. the geometry as seen by the physical objects ( fields etc . ) , see the discussion in @xcite .",
    "the generalized dirac or laplace operators encode the information about this physical geometry : a ) the space - time is a foliated manifold ( as in adm approach ) ; b ) the time scales differently from the space .",
    "\\2 ) at the same time , the dirac operator contains the information about the dynamics of both geometry and matter . essentially , this is the main idea behind the spectral action principle @xcite .",
    "the great advantage of this approach is in the fact that the same object ( dirac operator ) controls both geometric and matter part of the action .",
    "and we see this as a very promising for applications to hl models where the action contains huge ambiguity .",
    "the success of the spectral action principle applied to the standard model @xcite is very encouraging .    while in @xcite the calculation",
    "was motivated by the first type of the reasonings - we calculated some geometrical characteristics of the typical hl space - time ( spectral dimension ) , here we would like to make some initial steps in the other direction .",
    "the knowledge of the heat kernel of the dirac operator is essential for the calculation of the geometric part of the spectral action @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to start with the heat kernel for the flat generalizations of laplacian ( as we will see , already this is not a completely trivial task ) .",
    "the result is not just of some methodological interest .",
    "rather it should serve as a starting point for the analysis of the general curved case , which is currently under study .",
    "the final outcome of this line of research should be purely algebraic derivation of the action for the hl gravity via the spectral action principle",
    ". this will be the focus of our future research .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section",
    "[ 1 ] , we study in details the case of a uv generalization of laplacian .",
    "section [ 2 ] is devoted to thorough analysis of the general flat case .",
    "multiple analytic results are obtained in complete agreement with previous studies as well as with physical intuition . in conclusions",
    "we discuss the importance of the obtained results and outline the future directions .",
    "finally , in appendix , we briefly review some properties of the fox - wright psi - function , providing some proofs of the facts used in the main text .",
    "the heat kernel technique is quite powerful and has been applied with great success in many different areas of theoretical and mathematical physics as well as in pure mathematics ( see , e.g. , @xcite for review ) .",
    "our interest in heat kernel is due to its intimate relation to the spectral action @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , one can say that knowing the heat kernel of some relevant dirac ( or laplace ) operator is equivalent to knowing what is the geometrical part of the physical action .",
    "there are two important points in this statement :    \\1 ) what is this physically relevant operator ?",
    "by now , it is well known that for the standard choice of the dirac operator one recovers the einstein - hilbert - yang - mills action @xcite .",
    "but what should be our choice if we want to employ this technique for some generalizations , like hl gravity ?",
    "\\2 ) even if the relevant operator has been chosen , it is still a non - trivial task to find a heat kernel for this operator .",
    "in fact , even in the case of the standard choice , this result can be found only in the form of some asymptotic series ( which is enough to produce the spectral action ! ) .",
    "the knowledge of the exact results for some specific cases is essential for this calculation @xcite .",
    "based on these two points , it should be clear that the most natural first step would be to start with some appropriate generalization of the _ flat _ laplacian . in @xcite",
    ", it was argued that such operator for the case of the foliated geometry with anisotropic scaling between space and time should be of the following form @xmath0 the index @xmath1 takes values @xmath2 and @xmath3 is used to contract the indices .",
    "@xmath4 is the anisotropic scaling exponent , i.e. under @xmath5 @xmath6 has a well - defined scaling : @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath8 factor in front of @xmath9 in ( [ heatkernel ] ) is to insure the generalized ellipticity ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "so , we would like to find a solution to the following problem : @xmath10 the formal solution of ( [ heatkernel ] ) is given by @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the standard generalized eigen - vector of @xmath13 , while @xmath14 . because in the momentum representation @xmath15 we have ( as usual , @xmath16 ) @xmath17 note that the generalized ellipticity condition is crucial for the convergence of this integral .",
    "the integral over @xmath18 is trivially taken producing the standard result for the 1-d kernel : @xmath19 using the @xmath20 symmetry , the expression for @xmath21 can be written in the following form @xmath22 we need to calculate the following integral @xmath23 this is done by expanding @xmath24 @xmath25 using the gauss multiplication formula for gamma - function , we can write for @xmath26 @xmath27 this allows us to re - write ( [ expansion ] ) in the following form @xmath28 the sum in ( [ final1 ] ) is immediately recognized as ( 1,1 ) fox - wright psi - function , @xmath29 @xcite , so the final answer for ( [ i ] ) takes the form ) leads to this non - trivial result in terms of a relatively rare special function . as a curious observation",
    ", we note that this seems to be absent even in @xcite . ]",

    "what we expect physically is that in both limits the spectral dimension will be given by the formula ( [ hld ] ) , with the only difference that in ir instead of @xmath4 the dimension should be controlled by @xmath74",

    "in this work we have studied heat kernels for a class of the generalized flat laplacians . this problem is of interest both mathematically and physically .    mathematically , in addition to that it is always interesting to find some new solutions of the heat kernel equation , our results of a great interest due to the their connection to generalized geometries . in our particular case ,",

    "along with obtaining ( or , probably re - deriving ? ) some properties of these functions , such as mentioned in section [ 2 ] re - summation formula or expression for the integral ( [ i ] ) in terms of a psi - function , the main point , in our opinion , is that we bring to the attention of broader scientific community such a powerful yet less known object as the fox - wright psi - function .",

    "this , taking into account the well - studied properties of fox - wright psi - functions , might help finding analytic solutions that have been missed before .",
    "the future directions quite naturally follow from the main goal of this line of the research : application of the spectral action principle to hl gravity .",
    "the next step should be the study of the heat kernel equation for some less trivial ( non - flat ) but still not general geometry .",
    "the complexity of our flat solutions shows that already this step will be technically a serious challenge and our preliminary study absolutely proves this .",
    "having the solution to this problem , one should try to reproduce hl action as a spectral action for this specific geometry .",
    "ultimately , this should lead to the complete spectral action .",
