    "the direction of kerr rotation is referred to the polarization direction of reflected light s central wave vector . generally speaking , under the condition of h polarization , the polarization direction of reflected",
    "light s central wave vector acquires no rotation for the absence of axion coupling .",
    "so there is no kerr effect .",
    "when time reversal breaking perturbation is introduced on the tis surface , the material becomes fully gapped and the axion coupling effect happens , which induces the kerr effect .",

    "next we numerically discuss this effect and reveal the unusual results caused by the axion coupling . the spin - dependent splitting rotation angle manifesting for the relationship @xmath76 is discussed in the fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "it represents some interesting properties with different axion angles .",
    "the results can be explained by considering the in - plane and transverse spin - dependent splitting , respectively .",
    "first , we analyze the in - plane one . in the past work",
    ", the in - plane spin - dependent splitting can not be observed in the case of horizontal polarization or vertical polarization  @xcite .",
    "however , in present research , this effect surprisingly happens in these two polarized states .",
    "the reason is ascribed to the axion coupling effect induced nonzero cross - polarized reflection coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath26 from eq .  ( [ srm ] ) . however , at the usual air - glass interface , the cross - polarized reflection coefficients are equal to zero so that the in - plane spin - dependent splitting can not be observed . remarkably , as we will investigate in the follows , the in - plane shifts are very sensitive to the value of axion angle .",
    "so the tunable value and sign of the axion angle allow us to describe a method for modulating the in - plane spin - dependent splitting .",
    "figure  [ fig2](c ) shows the in - plane shifts in photonic she changing with the incident angle and the axion angle .",
    "here we just consider the left - circularly polarized component and the polarized state is chosen as horizontal polarization .",
    "for a positive ( or negative ) axion anlge ( @xmath79 ) , the absolute values of the in - plane shifts first rise with the increasing of incident angle .",
    "then the displacements decrease after leaving away from the maximum and reach the negative maximum value .",
    "for a fixed incident angle , the absolute values of the displacements increase when the axion angle grows ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "when the axion angle changes its sign , the in - plane shifts reverse its direction too . obviously , the in - plane spin - dependent splitting is sensitive to the variations of axion angle .",
    "therefore we can determine the values of the axion coupling by detecting the in - plane shifts of photonic she or modulate the in - plane displacments by manipulating the magnitude of axion angle .",
    "it should be noted that , as for the tis , the in - plane spin - dependent splitting origin from the axion coupling effect . if we set the axion angle @xmath81 , the fresnel coefficients obtaining from eq .",
    "( [ tirm ] ) can reduce to the result of usual media such as bk-7 glass and the in - plane spin - dependent splitting disappear .",
    "the transverse spin - dependent splitting in photonic she is described in fig .  [ fig2](d ) .",
    "we also calculate the transverse shifts varying with the incident angle @xmath3 and axion angle @xmath2 . for a given axion angle , the transverse displacements firstly rise with the increase of @xmath3 . after reaching the peak value at the incident angle about @xmath82 ,",
    "the shift decreases rapidly and then get the negative maximum value . as shown ,",
    "the transverse displacements can be tuned to a negative or positive value by adjusting the incident angle , which represents a switchable property . however , with the variations of axion angle @xmath2 , the transverse shifts are almost identical .",
    "that is to say , the transverse spin - dependent splitting is insensitive to the axion coupling effect .",
    "in fact , there really exists tiny differences between various displacement curves .",
    "but these differences are too small to be distinguished in the picture .",
    "it should be noted that , however , the transverse displacements can represent a significant variation when the axion angle is chosen as a large value .",

    "however , it also affects the polarization structure of kerr effect for certain incident angle ranges .",
    "and the other electric field component @xmath58 takes the great role in kerr rotation .",
    "figures  [ fig3](a)-[fig3](d ) show the electric field intensity and polarization distribution of these two components . here",
    "the incident angle is chosen as @xmath83 or @xmath84 and the axion angle is selected as @xmath85 . from figs .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and  [ fig3](c ) , we can see that the polarization is mainly in vertical direction .",
    "when the incident angle is less than about @xmath72 , the electric field component @xmath58 represent a tiny value and the first spin - orbit coupling electric field component can affect the kerr rotation .",
    "therefore the kerr angle shows a small rotation .",
    "as the incident angle increasing , the second component plays the major role in the kerr rotation and kerr angle can reach a huge value ( about @xmath74 ) .",
    "figures  [ fig3](b ) and  [ fig3](d ) describe the electric field intensity of the spin - orbit coupling component . here , the blue arrows , circles , and ellipses represent the polarization distribution .",
    "when the spin - dependent splitting occurs , the photons with opposite helicities accumulated at the opposite edges of the beam .",
    "generally speaking , the photonic she including in - plane and transverse spin - dependent splitting can be explained by the cross - polarized effect  @xcite .",
    "the superposition of the main electric field and cross - polarized electric field components finally cause the photons with opposite helicities accumulated at the opposite edges of the beam , which is the feature for the spin - dependent splitting . in this work , owing to the axion coupling effect , the polarization direction of reflected light s central wave vector changes a tiny value showing a difference with the initial polarization direction .",
    "so the direction of the cross - polarized electric field vector is also not perpendicular to initial polarization direction .",
    "it is perpendicular to the polarization direction of reflected light s central wave vector .",
    "we note that the analysis of the cross - polarized effect is useful for studying of both kerr rotation and photonic she .",

    "figures  [ fig4](a ) ,  [ fig4](c ) , and  [ fig4](e ) show the main electric field distribution of reflected beam .",
    "we draw not only the electric field intensity but also the electric field vector . in the above analysis",
    ", we know that the direction of kerr rotation can be registered in the polarization direction of reflected light s central wave vector . from the picture , we can see that the direction of central electric field vector ( the tiny arrows ) undergoes a rotation with different incident angles .",
    "so the kerr effect also rotates its direction ( the solid arrows ) .",
