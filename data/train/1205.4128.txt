    "the advantage of performing the experiments at high magnetic field , so that @xmath40 , is that the signal @xmath35 has a clear form : for most values of @xmath15 , the depth of the signal modulation @xmath112 is small , of order of @xmath113 . here , the axes @xmath29 and @xmath30 are practically parallel and the nuclear spin undergoes an unconditional rotation ( fig 1(d ) ) .",
    "the modulation is only strong when the decoupling sequence is precisely resonant with the nuclear spin dynamics . at resonance , the axes @xmath29 and @xmath30 are anti - parallel , i.e. @xmath114 , leading to a conditional rotation of the nuclear spin ( fig .",

    "for the fits in the main text we take the overall decay of the signal due to the relaxation and dephasing of the electron spin into account .",
    "the equation relating the obtained signal @xmath8 to the modulation @xmath35 due to the interaction with the nuclear spins becomes : @xmath132 in which @xmath133 and @xmath134 are two phenomenological time constants .",
