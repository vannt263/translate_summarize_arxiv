    "online social networks are ubiquitous , as is the realization that our times are being reshaped by them . on the more successful of these platforms ,",
    "vast user bases distributed around the world are in continuous conversation , transacting information , thoughts and ideas  we use the term _ topic _ in this paper  in a variety of formats .",
    "sometimes these transactions lead an otherwise obscure notion to global fame .",
    "this possibility of a rags - to - riches story in the world of memes is the wellspring of much of the excitement surrounding osns , an excitement captured in the coinage `` going viral '' .",
    "understanding the processes which make certain topics go viral while others do not is crucial , and could have wideranging economic , social and political consequences . in this paper",
    "we present and study a model of topic diffusion on social networks , along with a model - driven study of a real data set , in order to shed some light on these processes .",
    "our main insight is that virality on social networks is _ not _ helped by long range links .",
    "virality , in fact , occurs when several close knit communities of users get interested in a topic to such an extent that they merge to form a very large cluster , causing the popularity of the topic to soar .",
    "we define a stochastic model whose dynamics are inspired by real user behavior , and whose macro characteristics closely resemble those of real osns .",
    "this model , the first comprehensive attempt of its kind to our knowledge , could be extremely useful in generating traces of topic diffusion in osns for a multitude of applications like infrastructure provisioning , viral marketing , disaster management etc , but our goal in defining this model is more fundamental : we hope that studying the mechanisms that engender virality in our model will lead to a basic understanding of the phenomenon of virality in social networks .    our model is a time - evolving stochastic model that captures some of the key features of the diffusion of topics in a social network .",
    "a stream of exogenous topics , we call this the _ global list _ ,",
    "is presented to the network s users as global list .",
    "the times of appearance of these topics is given by a poisson point process .",
    "each exogenous topic has a weight that decays exponentially with the passage of time , reflecting the way in which interest in topics decreases as they get older .",
    "the users also perform actions at times whose distribution follows a poisson process independent of the time distribution of other users and of the global list . at each poisson time",
    "the user decides to talk on a topic picked randomly from the global list or from one of the topics in the lists of its neighbors .",
    "this action creates an instance of that topic in the user s list .",
    "this instance has a weight that also decays exponentially .",
    "the probability distribution by which the user decides which topic to speak on is determined by the weights of the topics in the global list and the weights of instances in its neighbors lists .",
    "the decay in weights of older topics and older instances of topics means that the model has an inherent bias towards newer topics .",
    "older topics retain or grow in strength in local neighborhoods only if those neighborhoods see a growth in instances being created in the neighborhood , capturing the notion that users in a social network are often peer pressured into responding to a particular topic if their connections are interested in it .",
    "our model is , therefore , implicitly a competitive model .",
    "the competition between topics here is not explicit , but it is real in a sense that advertisers and political parties will immediately recognize : it is a competition for the limited mindspace of the user base .",
    "our model ends up capturing this notion of a limited mindspace by ensuring that the total weight of instances resident on a node is stationary ( in a probabilistic sense ) i.e. it might be elastic to some extent but on average over a long period of time it is bounded .    in this study",
    "we have used a small - world network to model the social network graph .",
    "the reason for this is that we are focusing on ordinary users whose connections show small world properties and have a high degree of reciprocity .",
    "the very high impact users that are present on osns like twitter  news media , celebrities  are not present in our network .",
    "we abstract their influence into the global list . in doing",
    "so we take the focus away from those topics whose wide spread is due to overwhelming promotion by high impact users and turn the lens on those topics whose virality is a consequence of the interest shown in them by the larger network of ordinary users .",
    "the small world network respects constraints on the number of connections a normal person can maintain similar to those suggested by dunbar  @xcite .",
    "the fundamental contribution of this paper is the model mentioned above .",
    "we describe this in detail in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "this model does not show behavior similar to a real - world osn for all settings of its parameters but we do find a parameter regime , we call it the _ viral regime _ , for which it does . to study this regime",
    "we proceed with a very simple notion of a viral topic : a topic which sees a very large number of instances created at any point of time is deemed viral .",
    "we use the vague notion `` very large '' to allow us greater flexibility while conforming to a popular notion of what constitutes a viral topic . in section",
    "[ sec : virality ] we describe the characteristics of a viral topic in the viral regime , particularly emphasizing the emergence of a giant component in the subgraph induced by users that have spoken on the topic . in section  [ sec : merging ] we discuss how the growth of the topic in several strongly - linked neighborhoods  we call them _",
    "lattice clusters_leads to viral behavior when these strongly - linked neighborhoods merge , through strong links ( as opposed to weak long - range links ) , to form a very large lattice cluster that forms the backbone for the wide spread of the topic .",
    "this narrative of ascent to virality is the main contribution of our paper .    in section  [ sec :",
    "preliminaries ] we describe our simulation set - up and the measurement study whose results we use to validate our model .",
    "we discuss some important strands of the literature in section  [ sec : intro : related ] .",
    "finally , we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] with some discussion of the implications of our work and future directions .",
    "there have been several studies on information diffusion through social networks , in an attempt to understand the dynamics behind such networks and explore virality .",

    "@xcite study a stochastic model to explain viral trends in twitter , concluding that retweeting drives virality .",
    "this finding is consistent with our claims since the act of retweeting is an expression of homophily and our surmise is that homophilic clusters drive virality .",
    "the relevance of a local density of links in spreading a contagion has been studied in the past under the header of complex propagation @xcite .",
    "these models show that when simultaneous existence of multiple activators is required for a node to get infected , long range links and randomness can slow down the propagation .",
    "the relevance of a clustered local community for sustenance has also been propounded by young  @xcite in the context of the spread of innovation .",
    "goldenberg et .",
    "@xcite come to a somewhat contradictory conclusion , claiming that strong and weak ties are equally important in product adoption through word - of - mouth .",
    "an important difference between these contagion - flavoured works and ours is that we operate in a competitive setting where the spread of a topic limits the spread of others .",
    "a similar setting is found in the competitive viral marketing  @xcite , where there is competition between different products .",
    "competitive diffusion is also studied with respect to rumor and anti - rumor  @xcite and good and bad campaigns  @xcite .",
    "our social network is modeled by a watts - strogatz graph  @xcite .",
    "we begin with a regular lattice ring consisting of @xmath0 nodes .",
    "every node has a total degree @xmath1 and is connected to the @xmath2 nearest nodes on either side of it .",
    "we call these local connections , _ lattice edges_. we then consider each lattice edge @xmath3 and rewire the endpoint @xmath4 to a random node @xmath5 with a specific probability , known as the rewiring probability .",
    "the new edge now is @xmath6 .",
    "the graph is constructed in this manner and is known to have structural properties lying between that of a regular graph and a random graph .    to ensure that the time - evolution of the system is a pure jump markov processes ( with the intention of eventually subjecting it to mean - field analysis  @xcite ) we assume that the inter - activity time of each user follows a poisson distribution , as do the inter - arrival times for new topics in the global list .",
    "all these distributions are independent of each other .",
    "the inter - activity times of all users have the same mean , a significant simplification .",
    "we need very high precision floating point numbers to generate activity times of nodes . for this",
    ", we generated random bit strings of length 100 .",
    "each random bit was obtained using the rand ( ) function in c. these bit strings are used to generate high precision random numbers between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we ran all our simulations on intel(r ) xeon(r ) cpu x5550 machine with a 4 gb ram and a 2.67 ghz quad - core processor .",
    "we simulated at three different network sizes ( 1000,10000 and 100000 nodes ) for time - window of 1000 units .",
    "this simulation completed in approximately 9 seconds on average for networks of size 1000 , in approximately 100 seconds for size 10000 and in about 19 minutes for size 100000 .",
    "the data set used in the measurement study in this paper is a part of the data we have engineered for an ongoing measurement project being carried out by our group .",
    "we describe the data set and the methodology only in outline here since the engineering aspects of preparing such a data set are complex and require a long treatment .",
    "the data set we engineered is a part of the ` tweet7 ' data set which was crawled by yang et al .",
    "we use the first three month s ( 11 june , 2009 to 31 august , 2009 ) tweets from this data set .",
    "the ` tweet7 ' data set contains information only about the tweets by each user , not the social relationships between the users .",
    "therefore , to build the social graph of these users , we merged ` tweet7 ' data set with another data set crawled by kwak et al .",
    "they crawled the information on the followers of almost all twitter users during the same period as that of ` tweet7 ' data .",
    "the combined data set contains 196,985,580 tweets and 9,801,062 users .",
    "we used opencalais  @xcite , a text analysis engine , to identify the topics from the remaining 90% of tweets .",
    "using hashtags and opencalais , we are able to extract nearly 6.2 m topics in 52 m tweets . from this set of topics , after a laborious multi - stage manual process whose details we omit here , we picked out a few topics to compare their evolution with those of the topics in the simulations . since our study focuses on topics that go viral due to the larger network of common users we mainly targeted topics that are being talked about by such users and not those being initiated and discussed by users with very high numbers of follows . for each such topic",
    ", we define a subgraph , consisting of only the nodes that have talked on this topic anytime during it s evolution .",
    "we put a directional edge on this subgraph from node @xmath9 to @xmath4 only if @xmath4 talked on this topic after @xmath9 had talked on it and there was an edge from @xmath9 to @xmath4 in the actual twitter graph .",
    "the model is hinged on the concepts of novelty and competition .",
    "novelty implies preference for newer topics over older ones . and competition adds the element of uncertainty to the dominance by newer topics .",
    "since these two concepts are general in nature , our model can be applied to different scenarios .",
    "we , however , focus here on the application of the model to diffusion of topics in a social network .",

    "the user network for microblogging sites such as twitter resemble a scale - free degree distribution with a few users having a large number of links followed by a fat tail of users with a low degree . here",
    "we focus primarily on users constituting the fat tail .",
    "the users ranking higher in the degree distribution behave similar to news media , exposing a large number of users to a topic .",
    "these high ranking users act like sources for the information , their participation in the social network being distinct from that of the larger masses .",
    "the question of relevance for such `` celebrity '' users is when to break a news and at what frequency to keep replenishing it with newer tidbits in order to maximize its spread .",
    "the answer to this question is dependent on understanding how the information spreads through the masses .",
    "we focus here on the masses which resemble a small world network and are the core group behind making a content go viral .",
    "microblogging sites such as twitter have a follower - following relationship .",
    "celebrities , public figures and news media updaters enjoy a high follower count .",
    "the nature of interaction is that of a directed link .",
    "however when we come to the masses , the nature of the links with users which are most frequently used are of a friendship nature  @xcite .",
    "we focus here on topics such as movies , politics , sports , amusing videos , gossip etc . which rely primarily on these friendship links to become the buzz of the town .",

    "these weights decay exponentially with time .",
    "we define the weight parameters later in this section , noting here that we consider a linear model where the weights of @xmath11 instances put together is just the sum of the individual weights of the @xmath11 instances at that time . in a microblogging network like twitter , where the users quickly browse their timeline and retweet or reply to tweets , multiple instances do not act in order to convince the user to speak on a topic .",

    "the efficacy of mean - field analysis in characterizing the evolution in this regime indicates that long - range interactions play no part here .",
    "in the viral regime the mean - field analysis breaks down completely .",
    "this regime is characterized by a marked diversity in the peak heights for various topics .",
    "figure  [ fig : regimes ] shows the evolution of topics in this regime .",
    "the fluctuations in the peak heights are much larger than mere stochastic variances as seen in the sub - viral regime .",
    "the marked distinction in peak heights for some topics allows us to adjudge these topics viral .",
    "we do not put forth any concrete threshold beyond which a topic may be called viral and below which non - viral .",
    "any unusually high peaked topic which can be seen to clearly overpower other topics during its lifetime is taken to be viral and we study such topics for viral characteristics .",
    "thus , the viral regime witnesses a self - attained virality as a result of dynamics through aptly tuned parameters .",
    "moving further in the same direction in the parameter space , we observe the end of the viral regime , marked by increasing similarity in the peak heights for evolution of various topics .",
    "although the evolution pattern resembles the sub - viral regime , the peak heights are much higher .",
    "the dynamics behind the pattern in this regime is different from those of the sub - viral regime , making us classify it as a regime of its own which we call the super - viral regime , and completely ignore for the rest of this paper since it does not show real world - like behavior .",
    "we now turn our focus to the regime of interest , the viral regime , beginning by reporting its characteristics and going on to explain what makes certain topics go viral .",
    "the viral regime has a definite diversity in the peaks achieved by various topics during their evolution .",
    "some topics clearly shoot up much higher than the average peak of other topics .",
    "such topics which have an unusually large number of nodes talking about them simultaneously , are termed viral .",
    "figure [ fig : viral_evolution ] shows an example evolution of topics in the viral regime for a networks of size 100000 .    in this section",
    "we present some statistical and topological studies performed on simulation traces of our model when parametrized in the viral regime .",
    "as expected , topic spread , lifetime and peaks all follow power law distributions .",
    "we also study the effect of the number of topic adopters on the spread of topics and find it to be negligible , which is what we wanted to achieve . on the topological front",
    "we find that viral topics have one large connected component while non - viral topics tend to be highly disconnected .",
    "we also present some topological findings that lay the groundwork for our theories regarding the emergence of virality ( presented in section  [ sec : merging ] . ) in this and the subsequent section we say that a node speaks on topic @xmath25 at time @xmath16 is the most recently created instance in the local list of the node at time @xmath16 is an instance of topic @xmath25 .",
    "figure  [ fig : rank_plot ] shows the rank ordered plot on a log - log scale for the topics in viral regime , with the topic having the highest peak during its evolution ranked first .",
    "the distribution follows a power law with very few topics achieving a high peak during their evolution followed by a fat tail of topics with low peaks .",
    "figure [ fig : lifetime_rank ] shows the rank ordered distribution for the lifetimes of various topics in the network .",

    "figure [ fig : maxspread_rank ] shows the rank ordered distribution for the maximum spread of a topic .",
    "the maximum spread depicts the number of nodes which speak about the topic at some point of time or the other during the evolution of the topic .",
    "the power law indicates that very few topics succeed to reach a high spread while many topics die out after reaching only a small number of nodes .",
    "the lifetime vs maximum spread is shown in figure [ fig : lifetime_maxspread ] .",
    "it supports the deduction that topics which live longer in the network are also able to reach out to a larger section of the network .",
    "the role of number of adopters has been crucial in the study of contagion over the years .",
    "the occurrence of high peaks in the evolution of some topics in the viral regime raises the question of whether these topics enjoy a higher number of adopters . in our model ,",
    "adopters of the topic are the nodes which adopt the topic from the global list .",
    "since these are the nodes which bring the topic into the network , one might be tempted to conclude that the number of adopters for viral topics is higher than that for the non - viral ones .",
    "figure [ fig : maxspread_adopters ] shows the distribution of the maximum spreads achieved by topics along with the number of adopters of the topic .",
    "there is no specific trend in the distribution which can lead us to believe that the topics enjoying higher number of adopters also reach out to a larger fraction of the network during their evolution . since variances in the degree of the adopters",
    "could significantly affect their reach and hence prove crucial , we incorporate them before correlating with the spread .",
    "figure [ fig : maxspread_sumdegree ] shows the distribution of the maximum spread of the topics with the sum of the degrees of the nodes which adopted these topics .",
    "we again see no particular correlation and can thus safely conclude that a higher number of adopters is not the reason for the peaks observed in the topic evolutions in the viral regime of our model .",
    "this demonstrates that our model does indeed eschew the effect of high impact users .",
    "the topics that go viral in our setting are the ones that the network itself promotes .      to study how the graph topology affects the evolution of the topic , we look at the evolution of clusters of nodes speaking on a particular topic simultaneously . figures  [ fig : sim_cluster-1 ] and  [ fig : sim_cluster-2 ] show the evolution of the cluster sizes along with the evolution of the topic for a viral and a non - viral topic .    a non - viral topic is characterized by many small clusters disconnected throughout the lifetime of the topic .",
    "the number of clusters increase when there is a peak in the evolution of the topic indicating that the surplus nodes speaking on the topic belong to clusters different from the existent ones . on the contrary , for a viral topic , we see a significant dip in the number of clusters when the topic peaks in its evolution .",
    "this is because of the formation of a giant cluster which encompasses a large fraction of the nodes speaking on the topic .",
    "the evolution sees similar sized clusters when the topic is young and the formation of a giant cluster when the topic peaks .",
    "figures  [ sim_cluster_fraction-1 ] and  [ sim_cluster_fraction-2 ] show the evolution of the fraction of nodes lying within the largest cluster .",
    "the non - viral sees a very small fraction inside the largest cluster while the viral sees a large fraction when it peaks in its evolution indicating that it is a giant component .    while the nodes speaking on the viral topic during its peak belong to a giant component , it is of interest to investigate whether the nodes have spoken before on the topic or not . in other words ,",
    "we look at how the number of unique nodes speaking on the topic in the largest cluster evolve with time .",
    "we term this as the cumulative size of the largest cluster . in figure",
    "[ fig : component ] we see that for a non - viral topic , the cumulative size grows and saturates at a low value some time during the evolution of the topic . for a viral topic , however , we see a sharp increase in the cumulative cluster size as the topic shoots up .",
    "the following times observe a saturation in the cumulative cluster size while the topic sustains a high peak .",
    "this is representative of the way a viral topic grows .",
    "the rise of the topic is marked by more and more new nodes speaking on the topic while the sustenance is marked by subsequent discussion among the nodes that have already talked on the topic .",
    "this behavior is also observed in real topics taken from the twitter data set .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in figure  [ fig : prob_histogram ] we show the histograms thus obtained for a viral topic and a non - viral topic from the viral regime on a network of size 10000 .",
    "firstly , we observe the difference in the peak heights of the histograms for a viral and a non - viral topic .",
    "this is a result of a viral topic being spoken about many number of times as compared to a non - viral topic . for a non - viral topic ,",
    "the local weights that are achieved maximum number of times hover around 0.2 to 0.4 . beyond 0.5 ,",
    "the peaks begin to dip .",
    "since achieving a high local weight is equivalent to more number of neighbors of the node talking on the topic in quick succession , the dip shows that such scenarios for a non - viral topic are rare . for a viral topic ,",
    "however , we observe a different pattern with the histograms peaking as we move closer to @xmath8 .",
    "this shows that for a viral topic , the scenarios where a node has most of its neighbors talking on the topic at quick successions are huge in number .",
    "in fact , it is this scenario of multiple neighbors talking simultaneously on the topic which makes the neighboring nodes adopt the topic with greater probability driving it viral .",
    "the peak in the local weight for the topic leads to it being chosen with greater probability which acts as a feedback making the topic go further viral and also sustain the virality .",
    "the real data shows a related phenomenon . in figure",
    "[ fig : iranelection_delta ] we see that once the topic `` iranelection '' has reached its peak ( of the order of @xmath32 ) , the change in the number of users is bounded in the order of a few hundred a day , often falling to much lower values . hence virality ,",
    "if sustained , is generally sustained by largely the same user base that caused it to occur in the first place , thereby making us feel that it is at the point of its emergence that a viral topic garners most of the support it is ever going to get .",
    "[ [ discussion ] ] discussion + + + + + + + + + +    the phenomenon of lattice cluster merging exhibits how a topic which is popular in a small group of users sharing homophily need not take over the entire network . if we consider the hops of @xmath2 as being a gradual shift in the subject binding these users closely to each other , the spread of the topic even when it is young shows the need for a few people in different related genres to speak on the topic simultaneously .",
    "these people influence more users to talk and the lattice cluster spreads .",
    "when the lattice clusters from two different genres collide , the intermediary users are encouraged to copy the topic owing to homophily on either side .",
    "both these genres attack the intermediary nodes which then begin to spread the buzz .",
    "the copying then sees both the distinct genres filling up as more and more hardcore users of the genre copy the topic .",
    "the quick filling in shows why most of the users do not seem to hear about the topic at all and then hear a lot about it suddenly and from everywhere , everywhere being a sign of the different genres that the node is a part of .",
    "much has been said in the last two decades about `` six degrees of separation '' and `` small worlds '' and it is true that the world is more closely linked today than it has ever been .",
    "but our results show that virality is not a function of the social network s ability to bring faraway things closer .",
    "it is , in fact , achieved when many smaller homophilic groups discover an interest in a certain topic .",
    "the overlapping of this interest over a large number of such groups leads to virality .",
    "this is , in some sense , an organic narrative of growing popularity , a narrative that those marketing executives who spend time poring over the early sales data of the girl with the dragon tattoo perhaps understand intrinsically .",
    "for those of a less commercial bent , those who want to change the world , also there is a lesson in our findings .",
    "that lesson is if enough people act locally in a large enough number of localities , there is a global impact .",
    "and a sobering thought is that no matter how intensely one community feels about some topic , unless other communities also develop that interest , the topic will die in small disconnected clusters .",
    "the main focus of this work has been on modeling the processes of diffusion although we have adduced results from a small measurement study to back up our claim that our model is a real model and that the artifacts we find in it have echoes in the real world .",
    "one prominent research direction to follow is a large - scale model - driven measurement study .",
    "another direction that remains is to generalize the model by allowing users to act at different times , perhaps act in correlated times rather than independent time , to repose different levels of trust in different neighbors , to view different classes of topics with different levels of interest . in the current work we sacrificed this rich diversity of the topic diffusion setting in order to define a model that was easier to handle while being sufficiently general as to describe a coarser level of behavior , but if a more nuanced view is taken then a richer model emerges .",
    "in such a case further measurement could also help to instantiate different parameter classes .",
