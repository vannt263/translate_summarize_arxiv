    "electromagnetic scattering from large cavities has been studied extensively over the years  @xcite , due to the widespread presence of cavities in practical settings .",
    "it is of particular interest in radar cross section ( rcs ) analysis , both for accentuating a signal ( in tracking a vehicle ) and for its mitigation ( in electromagnetic interference and stealth design ) .",
    "cavities play an important role in these contexts because of the well - known fact that the intensity of the echo wave is often dominated by scattering from cavity - like components  @xcite , such as the exhaust nozzle or engine inlet of an aircraft . in the context of design ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , where rcs enhancement or reduction was carried out through the use of an optimization procedure based on a newton - type method . at each iteration",
    ", a large - scale scattering problem has to be solved , dominating the net cost .",
    "a second application is non - destructive testing to determine the shape of an existing cavity .",
    "the corresponding stability analysis was initially studied in  @xcite . numerical inversion",
    "again requires an efficient solver that works over a range of frequencies . to obtain fine features inside the cavity ,",
    "high frequency measurements are required , making the problems large , oscillatory and progressively more ill - conditioned . in short , efficient and accurate numerical methods for modeling in the presence of _ complex , arbitrarily - shaped cavities _ are becoming essential .",
    "integral equation methods are very natural choices for the solution of scattering problems because they discretize the scatterer alone and are able to impose outgoing radiation conditions without the need for truncating the spatial domain and imposing artificial boundary conditions . in the case of cavities in a conducting half - space , a variety of integral formulations exists and we refer the readers to bao _ et al _",

    ", we simply note that the choice of integral equation has a great impact on the accuracy of the numerical discretization  @xcite and the condition number of the resulting linear system . in this article",
    ", we propose a boundary integral formulation that leads in a straightforward way to a well - posed , high - order discretization . like the formulation of  @xcite",
    ", we impose continuity conditions on a  transparent \" dome covering the cavity , which reduces the problem to one posed in a bounded domain .",
    "a principal difference is that , in our case , we introduce a non - physical charge density on part of the ground plane which permits high order accuracy - avoiding the difficulties introduced by signularities at _ triple - points _ , points that lie at the intersection of more than two subdomains ( see fig . [ figure_cavity_shape ] ) .",
    "historically , the major challenge with integral formulations has been that the corresponding linear system is dense so that solving by conventional linear solvers is expensive , requiring @xmath0 work for a @xmath1 linear system . that complexity barrier was overcome by using iterative techniques based on krylov subspace methods  @xcite , coupled with fast matrix - vector product techniques such as the fast multipole method ( fmm )  @xcite , tree based algorithms  @xcite , panel clustering  @xcite , fft  @xcite , wavelet based methods  @xcite , and a host of others .",
    "though these techniques have a number of attractions , the number of iterations required to achieve a specified accuracy is highly problem - dependent . in the context of electromagnetic scattering ,",
    "if the geometry is complicated and if the frequency of the incident field is high , the number of iterations can be extremely large , so that the methods no longer behave linearly and require large amounts of storage .",
    "recently , there has been an increasing focus on fast direct solvers  @xcite for dense linear systems arising from integral equations .",
    "this is an important and active area of research and we refer the reader to three relevant ( and related ) formualtions - those based on hierarchical off - diagonal low - rank matrices ( hodlr )  @xcite , hierarchically semi - separable ( hss ) or hierarchically block - separable ( hbs ) matrices  @xcite , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 matrices  @xcite . in this article , since the integral equation we are solving is on a @xmath4d manifold , we rely on the fast direct solver discussed in ambikasaran and darve  @xcite , which scales almost linearly ( as @xmath5 ) in the number of unknowns even for problems that are hundreds of wavelengths in size .",
    "we restrict our attention here to time - harmonic scattering over a wide range of frequencies for a @xmath6d cavity embedded in a ground plane , as shown in figure  [ figure_cavity_shape ] , where the boundary of the cavity and the ground plane are perfectly conducting .",
    "the cavity is _ empty _",
    ", i.e. , the permittivity @xmath7 and permeability @xmath8 are constant everywhere inside the cavity and equal to that of the upper half - space .     and",
    "@xmath9 are triple - points .",
    "they lie at the intersection of domains @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . ]",
    "it is well known that , in @xmath6d , the wave can be decomposed into a transverse magnetic ( tm ) polarization component and a transverse electric ( te ) polarization component .",
    "maxwell s equations reduce in this setting to a scalar helmholtz equation for the @xmath14-component the magnetic ( te ) or electric ( tm ) field , respectively .",
    "we restrict our attention to the tm polarization and denote the @xmath14-component of the electric field by @xmath15 , but note that the treatment of the te polarization is very similar .",
    "we seek to determine the unknown scattered wave @xmath16 , emanating from the cavity @xmath10 in response to a known incident wave @xmath17 .",
    "the governing equation is the helmholtz equation : @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the upper half space , @xmath20 is the boundary of the cavity , @xmath21 is the ground plane and @xmath22 is the wavenumber .",
    "the wavenumber @xmath22 depends on the given angular frequency @xmath23 ( time harmonic dependence is @xmath24 ) , i.e. , @xmath25 .",
    "where , as noted above , the permittivity @xmath7 and permeability @xmath8 are assumed to be constant .",
    "the total field @xmath15 is considered as the summation of three parts  @xcite : the incident field @xmath17 , the reflected field @xmath26 and the scattered field @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath27 is known , and typically defined as a plane wave or the wave induced by known sources in the upper half - space .",
    "@xmath28 denotes the wave reflected by a perfectly conducting half - space ( without a cavity ) and can be computed analytically from @xmath27 . the only unknown , therefore , is the scattered field @xmath16 , which satisfies the helmholtz equation   as well as the sommerfeld radiation condition : @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section_formulation ]",
    ", we describe the cavity problem in more detail .",
    "we propose a new second kind integral formulation that leads to a stable numerical algorithm .",
    "in addition , we prove uniqueness for the equation , showing that the the formulation is well - posed .",
    "section  [ section_numerical_discretization ] discusses the numerical discretization of the integral equation , while section  [ section_fast_direct_solver ] discusses the hierarchical , fast , direct solver that relies on specific properties of the matrix arising from discretization of our integral equation .",

    "consider a time - harmonic wave incident on the cavity @xmath10 , embedded in an infinite ground plane @xmath21 , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure_cavity_shape ] . the boundary components @xmath20 and @xmath21 are both assumed to be perfect conductors .",
    "we also assume that @xmath20 is defined by a piecewise smooth curve and that none of the corners between adjacent smooth components involve cusps ( that is , the angle at each corner is greater than @xmath31 and less than @xmath32 ) .",
    "when the incoming field is a plane wave , we have @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the angle of incidence with respect to the positive @xmath36 axis . in this case",
    ", the scattered wave @xmath16 satisfies the equation : @xmath37 along with the sommerfeld radiation condition , where @xmath38 .",
    "a variety of integral formulations have been proposed in the literature for the cavity problem .",
    "those discussed in  @xcite , for example , are based on green s identities .",
    "another formulation , based on the method of images , is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "our formulation is based on potential theory , with the goal of deriving a second kind integral equation that will lead to a high order numerical scheme , even in the presence of sharp corners . in all these approaches , it is convenient to introduce an artificial interface close to the cavity , which we denote here by @xmath39 ( illustrated by the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ figure_cavity_shape ] ) . one does not need to introduce artificial boundary conditions on this interface , however .",
    "one simply imposes continuity conditions so that there is a representation for the scattered wave in the exterior of @xmath39 as an integral over the artificial interface itself .",
    "@xmath39 needs to be chosen so that its reflection with respect to the ground plane , @xmath40 , does not intersect the cavity .",
    "we denote by @xmath41 the part of the ground plane @xmath21 that connects @xmath39 and @xmath20 and define @xmath10 to be the domain enclosed by @xmath42 .",
    "its complement is the unbounded domain @xmath43 .",
    "we let @xmath44 denote the ( radiating ) free space green s function for the helmholtz equation and we let @xmath45 denote the green s function satisfying homogeneous dirichlet conditions on the half space .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the hankel function of the first kind of order zero and @xmath48 is the image point for @xmath49 .",
    "a natural representation for @xmath16 in the unbounded domain @xmath43 is @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are single and double layer potentials , using the half - space green s function : @xmath53 here the unit normal vector @xmath54 on @xmath39 is assumed to be oriented toward the exterior of @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath8 are , for the moment , unknown density functions on the boundary @xmath39 .",
    "by the methods of images , we can rewrite @xmath51 as : @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes single layer potential based on the free - space green s function @xmath58 and for @xmath59 , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the image point for @xmath62 .",
    "clearly , a similar expression holds for @xmath52 using the free - space double layer potential @xmath63    suppose now that we represent the scattered field for @xmath64 by @xmath65    imposing the continuity of the potential @xmath15 and its normal derivative across @xmath39 , and using the representations and , leads to @xmath66 for this , one needs to use standard jump relations for the layer potentials @xmath67 and @xmath68 @xcite . the operators @xmath69 and @xmath70 are defined as the normal derivatives of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively : @xmath71 note that the operator @xmath70 is _ hypersingular _ on @xmath20 , with its value interpreted in the hadamard finite part sense .",
    "similarly , using the representation  , and letting @xmath72 approach the boundary @xmath73 , yields @xmath74    combining eqs .",
    "and   we obtain a closed system for @xmath55 and @xmath8 .",
    "unfortunately , careful analysis shows that it is not a fredholm equation of the second kind .",
    "in particular , the hypersingular operators are unbounded at the _ triple - points _ @xmath75 and @xmath9 in fig .",
    "[ figure_cavity_shape ] .",
    "this leads to a failure of convergence . following the approach of @xcite , we remedy the situation by using a non - physical representation near triple - points so that the resulting integral equation involves only the _ difference _ of two hypersingular kernels , which is easily seen to be compact .",
    "thus , we propose the following , new formulation : @xmath76    we refer to the representation as non - physical because the terms we have added ( @xmath77 for the exterior field and @xmath78 for the interior field ) that involve boundary components that do not actually impinge on the domain .",
    "the advantage we obtain is a cancellation of the hypersingular terms . to see this , imposing the continuity and boundary conditions as above , and using the standard jump relations",
    ", we obtain the system : @xmath79    although the representation   is slightly more involved than and , note that the resulting system of integral equations is actually simpler . in particular , the first two equations in imply that @xmath8 and @xmath55 on @xmath39",
    "are directly determined by the value of @xmath8 on @xmath20 .",
    "more importantly , the system is a fredholm equation of the second kind in a suitably - defined space .",
    "the analysis is somewhat technical , since operators that are compact on smooth domains are only bounded on domains with corners .",
    "that is the case here , and we refer the reader to @xcite for further details . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss existence and uniqueness , followed by a discussion of numerical discretization .    in @xcite ,",
    "a related formulation was developed that used only the unknown @xmath8 on @xmath80 in .",
    "this , however , requires that the cavity remain strictly below the ground plane .",
    "our approach works for an arbitrary cavity shape .      to simplify the analysis",
    ", we assume that the boundary of the cavity @xmath81 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are @xmath82 smooth curves , in which case the solution @xmath15 to eq .",
    "lies in @xmath83 ( see @xcite ) so that the standard fredholm theory applies .",
    "thus , to establish uniqueness for the system , it suffices to show that @xmath84 and @xmath85 if @xmath86 .",
    "extension of the proof to the piecewise - smooth case is straightforward , and consists largely in a switch to the corresponding sobolev space in order that the fredholm theory be applicable .",
    "given @xmath87 , the system @xmath88 has only the trivial solution for @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "motivated by the analysis of @xcite , we let @xmath91 where @xmath11 is the area enclosed by @xmath92 .    combining and eq . , we have @xmath93 and the jump conditions @xmath94|_{\\gamma_1 } & = 0 , \\\\ \\bigg[\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial n}\\bigg]|_{\\gamma_1 } & = 0 , \\end{split } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath95|_{\\gamma_1}$ ] denotes the jump of the function @xmath96 across the boundary @xmath39 .",
    "we first prove @xmath96 is identically zero in @xmath97 .",
    "for this , choose a sufficiently large half disk @xmath98 above the ground plane that contains the boundary @xmath39 .",
    "for the area @xmath99 , the boundary consists of @xmath39 , part of the ground plane ( still denoted by @xmath21 ) and a half circle , denoted by @xmath100 .",
    "applying green s theorem to @xmath96 in @xmath99 and @xmath10 , respectively , we obtain @xmath101 and @xmath102 adding eq . and eq . , together with and , yields @xmath103 which implies that @xmath104 it follows from rellich s theorem @xcite , applied to the half space , and the unique continuation property @xcite , that @xmath105 in @xmath97 .",
    "we next show @xmath106 satisfies the following equation in @xmath11 @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the image curve of @xmath20 with respect to the ground plane and @xmath109 on @xmath108 is the image source of @xmath110 on @xmath20 .",
    "it follows from that we have the following jump condition on @xmath40 : @xmath111_{\\gamma_2 } = \\mu + \\mathcal{d}_{\\gamma}\\mu\\\\ \\bigg[\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial n}\\bigg]_{\\gamma_2 } = -\\sigma + \\mathcal{t}_{\\gamma}\\mu . \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath105 in @xmath97 , by symmetry , @xmath112 in @xmath113 . from , @xmath114 for @xmath115 .",
    "however , by the definition of the image curve @xmath108 and the source @xmath8 on @xmath108 , it is easy to see that @xmath116 .",
    "similarly , one can see that @xmath117 for @xmath115 .",
    "combining eqs and leads to @xmath118 we therefore obtain the first two boundary conditions for @xmath96 in .",

    "\\bigg[\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial n}\\bigg]_{b\\cup \\gamma } = 0\\ , , \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the fact that @xmath96 is zero in @xmath10 .",
    "we now prove that the solution to is identically zero .",
    "let @xmath120 it is easy to see @xmath121 on @xmath21 and @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 denote the limiting function values as @xmath72 approaches @xmath40 from @xmath125 and @xmath11 , respectively .    as in the first part of the proof , we now choose a sufficiently large half disk , still denoted by @xmath98 , in @xmath125 that contains @xmath40 . applying the first green s theorem to @xmath126 and @xmath11 , eq . , and",
    "the various jump conditions above lead to : @xmath127 once again , from rellich s theorem and unique continuation we may conclude that @xmath105 in @xmath11 , which implies that ( a ) @xmath128 on @xmath80 from , and ( b ) @xmath128 , @xmath129 on @xmath39 from .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "the cavity problem can also be solved through a variational formulation .",
    "the corresponding well - posedness was studied in @xcite .",
    "for our numerical simulations , we will make use of nystrm discretization of the integral equation . since the kernels in the integral equation are logarithmically singular , this requires some care .",
    "fortunately , for smooth boundaries , there are by now a host of simple , high - order rules available ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) . here , we use composite gaussian quadrature . following the discussion of @xcite , we divide each smooth component of the boundary into @xmath130 curved panels with @xmath131 points in each panel .",
    "the @xmath131 points are chosen as scaled gaussian - legendre nodes , so that for smooth integrands the order of accuracy is @xmath132 .",
    "more precisely , we replace the integral @xmath133 by the quadrature @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the @xmath136-th gauss - legendre node on panel @xmath137 , @xmath138 is the @xmath139-th gauss - legendre node on panel @xmath140 , @xmath141 is the quadrature weight and @xmath142 is the `` quadrature kernel '' . for non - adjacent panels",
    ", we simply set @xmath143 , for node @xmath135 on panel @xmath137 and node @xmath138 on panel @xmath139 .",
    "the weights @xmath141 in that case are the standard gauss - legendre weights at @xmath138 scaled to the length of the @xmath140-th panel . for the self - interaction of a panel ( @xmath144 ) , or the interaction with an adjacent panel ,",
    "the quadrature kernel is computed by generalized gaussian quadrature  @xcite . from a linear algebra point of view , the self and adjacent panel interactions correspond to the block tridiagonal entries in the matrix . in our direct solver , these elements are precomputed and stored .",
    "all other matrix entries are computed on the fly .    in the presence of corners ,",
    "a graded mesh  @xcite is used to maintain high order accuracy . more specifically , after uniform discretization by panels , we perform a dyadic refinement for the panels that impinges on each corner point . a @xmath131-th order generalized gaussian quadrature",
    "is used on each of the refined panels . the formal error analysis for such discretization",
    "is rather involved , since it depends on the regularity of @xmath55 and @xmath8 .",
    "readers are referred to  @xcite and the references therein for a discussion of the relevant analysis .",
    "typically , if @xmath7 denotes the length of the finest panel in the refinement , then the error is proportional to @xmath145 .",
    "since the mesh is dyadically refined , this requires @xmath146 additional nodes at each corner .    with a total of @xmath130 nodes , solving the linear system corresponding to the above discretization by conventional gaussian elimination requires @xmath0 work - an arduous task if the cavity has a complicated boundary or if the wavenumber of the incoming field is high . if the wave number @xmath147 , for example , and if the length of the boundary is @xmath148 ( in normalized units ) , then the number of unknowns is around @xmath149 , assuming @xmath148 points per wavelength and counting each complex unknown as two real unknowns .",
    "conventional solvers would take a few days to factor this system on a single core machine operating at @xmath150ghz .",
    "the fast direct solver described in the next section takes around @xmath151 minutes .",
    "in this section , we briefly outline the fast direct solver we will use to solve the discretized integral equation  .",
    "it is a simple extension of the method described in  @xcite , to which we refer the reader for a more complete description of the method .",
    "as noted in the introduction , there are two strong arguments in favor of this strategy :    * the performance of the direct solver is insensitive to multiple reflections inside the cavity . at high frequencies ,",
    "this causes the problem to be _ physically _ ill - conditioned and causes severe degradation in the convergence of iterative methods . *",
    "the solver is particularly effective for multiple right hand sides .",
    "it proceeds in two steps : first , the construction of a fast hierarchical factorization , and second the application of the factored inverse to each new right - hand side , at much lower cost .",
    "discretizing the integral equation   along the curve ( a one - dimensional manifold ) and ordering the unknowns and equations sequentially , yields a linear system of the form @xmath152 , where @xmath153 , @xmath154 . because potential - theoretic interactions are smooth in the far field , the matrix @xmath155 has a hierarchical off - diagonal low - rank ( hodlr ) structure , as observed in  @xcite .",
    "( related formalisms that also permit fast solution can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and the references therein . )    for illustration , we note that a @xmath6-level hodlr matrix can be written in the form shown in equation  ( [ equation_hodlr_2_level ] ) .",
    "@xmath156 each off - diagonal block is of low - rank ( i.e. , the rank of these blocks does not grow with the system size ) , although these ranks can all be different .",
    "in general , for a @xmath157-level hodlr matrix @xmath155 , the @xmath158 diagonal block at level @xmath22 , where @xmath159 and @xmath160 , denoted by @xmath161 , can be written as @xmath162 where @xmath163 , and @xmath164 are thin matrices with @xmath165 rows .",
    "a pictorial representation of the matrix @xmath155 is shown in figure  [ figure_hodlr_matrix ] .",
    "for the solver developed here , the low - rank decomposition of the off - diagonal blocks is obtained using the adaptive cross approximation ( aca )  @xcite algorithm , which is a modification of the partially pivoted lu algorithm .",
    "the advantage of aca is that the computational cost of obtaining a low - rank factorization of a low - rank @xmath166 matrix is @xmath167 .",
    "the technique is based entirely on numerical linear algebra , so the low - rank construction of the off - diagonal blocks is independent of the underlying integral operator .",
    "once the low - rank decomposition of the off - diagonal blocks at all levels is obtained , the factorization of the matrix @xmath155 proceeds along the lines described in  @xcite .",
    "in other words , the matrix @xmath155 is factored as shown in eq .  .",
    "@xmath168 where the @xmath169 s are block diagonal matrices with @xmath170 diagonal blocks and each block is a low - rank perturbation of the identity matrix .",
    "the factorization can be obtained at a computational cost of the order @xmath5 by recursive application of the sherman - morrison - woodbury formula .",
    "a pictorial representation of the above factorization for a level @xmath171 hodlr matrix is shown in figure  [ figure_hodlr_factorization ] .    .",
    "]    other fast methods , such as the interpolative decomposition  @xcite can be used in place of aca .",
    "further details can be found in  @xcite and an implementation is available from  @xcite .    as with any direct factorization ,",
    "a principal advantage is the performance of the scheme with multiple right hand sides .",
    "that is , the cost of solving the linear system with ` @xmath172 ' right - hand sides scales as @xmath173 , with a smaller constant than for the factorization step .",
    "this is very attractive in the present context , since it permits the computation of the scattered field for multiple incident angles in a negligible amount of time .",
    "each problem corresponds to a new right - hand side in the integral equation .",
    "in this section , we illustrate the performance of our algorithm on three different cavity shapes . in general , there is no exact solution for the field scattering from a cavity embedded in a ground plane .",
    "we may , however , validate our solver by using ",
    "artificial \" boundary data generated by a collection of point sources , in which case the potential field is known and can be used for comparison with the potential generated by the integral representation on the boundary .",
    "more specifically , we define the following field in the perturbed upper half - space @xmath97 : @xmath174 we then solve the following system of equations @xmath175 where @xmath176 , @xmath177 and the center of the cavity is at @xmath178 .",

' '' ''    in the examples below , when solving the true scattering problem , the incoming field is assumed to be a plane wave and we compute the backscatter radar cross section ( rcs ) for each cavity .",
    "the backscatter rcs is defined as the intensity of the far field pattern in the same direction as the incident angle .",
    "when the boundary of the cavity is strictly below the ground plane , it can be shown the backscatter rcs is given by  @xcite : @xmath186 where @xmath35 is the angle of incidence and @xmath20 is the aperture of the cavity . if part of the boundary is above the ground plane , the rcs can be found from @xmath187 and the asymptotic behavior of the hankel function .",

    "that is , the discrete unknowns are taken to be the physical unknowns multiplied by the square root of the corresponding quadrature weight .",

    "we have presented a new integral formulation for high frequency electromagnetic scattering from a large cavity that leads to a second kind integral equation and which is compatible with a fast and accurate direct solver .",
    "the main novelty is the use of a global density , which is non - physical in the sense that the field in certain domains is determined by layer potential densities that are not necessarily on the boundary of the domain itself .",
    "we have proven well - posedness of the formulation , which implies that the method does not suffer from any spurious resonances .",
    "the equation is discretized by high order quadrature and numerical experiments show that the direct solver is very effective even for large frequencies and arbitrarily - shaped cavities .",
    "future work includes extending the formulation to an impedance boundary , to the full maxwell equations in three dimensions , and to problems of optimal design .",
