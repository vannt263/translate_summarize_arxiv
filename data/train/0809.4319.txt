    "at present there are no doubts that the qualitatively differing types of nuclear excitations co - exist , interact and have defining influence on the structure and parameters of any nucleus .",
    "namely , they are quasiparticle and vibrational ones .",
    "this is the main conclusion of such fundamental nuclear models as qpnm @xcite and different variants of ibm @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the majority of experiments carried out by now gives direct and quite reliable information on the structure of a nucleus only for too small energies of its excitation .",
    "practically , for example , in @xcite even - odd heavy nucleus this region is up to now limited by the excitation energy interval of @xmath31 mev order . up to the present radiative strength functions of @xmath32 gamma - transitions in the whole range of their energies",
    "@xmath33 , appearing at decay of any levels with the excitation energies @xmath34 , have been experimentally studied to the least degree .",
    "main problems of the experiment , which occur at the determination of @xmath35 and @xmath36 consist in the necessity to :    \\(a ) really estimate the most serious systematical errors and to minimize their values as much as possible ;    \\(b ) maximally exclude any model representations , which are unavoidable at extracting the parameters of the process from the registered spectra in an indirect experiment .",
    "first of all , the latter refers to the basic hypothesis @xcite on the independence of the cross section of any reverse reaction from the excitation energy of final nucleus used for the analysis of all the experiments conducted up to the present .    according to particular calculations @xcite of the probabilities of gamma - transitions below @xmath37 mev and experimental data @xcite on the level cascade populating ability of different types of nuclei below @xmath38 , for example",
    ", it is expected that the hypothesis @xcite is completely inapplicable in even - even deformed nuclei .",
    "between the decaying of compound states @xmath39 and a group of the low lying levels @xmath40 of the studied nucleus @xcite both tasks of the experiment are solved to the most possible degree by the registration of two - step cascade intensities @xmath41 with the summed energy 5 - 10 mev .",
    "it is just the analysis of two - step cascade intensities of thermal neutrons radiative capture in the fixed by @xcite @xmath42 energy intervals of their intermediate levels @xmath43 : @xmath44 that first revealed the possibility of the model - free simultaneous determination of @xmath35 and @xmath36 with their guarantee reliability .    in the initial variant @xcite it was performed at assuming the independence of partial radiative widths @xmath45 of the gamma - transitions of given energy and multipolarity from energies of any primary @xmath46 and final @xmath47 levels ( that is , using hypothesis @xcite ) . in contemporary version",
    "@xcite it is accomplished without its use in the region of the low lying levels ( @xmath48 ) .    in order to practically calculate the cascade intensities and compare them with the experiment it is necessary to take into account the real specific character of the studied process . in certain energy interval @xmath49 of the excited levels",
    "there is only the value of @xmath50 sum of partial radiative widths available for comparison with the calculation . for any interval of number @xmath51 excitation energy",
    "this sum may be always mathematically presented as a multiplication of a certain average of partial width @xmath52 at @xmath53 number of excited levels .",
    "equation ( 1 ) is transformed into @xmath54 for any interval number @xmath51 .",
    "since this sum includes partial widths of gamma - transitions between levels of different structure ( see , for example , @xcite ) , the average width of primary @xmath55 and secondary @xmath56 gamma - transitions is an averagely weighted value for any @xmath51 and @xmath57 intervals in the indicated representation .",
    "it is determined by a particular ratio of quasiparticle and phonon components of wave functions of the studied nucleus levels , belonging to the @xmath42j interval .",
    "it is necessary to take into account this circumstance when comparing experimental @xmath36 values with theoretical representations .    system ( 2 ) includes @xmath58 of nonlinear equations and @xmath59 of unknown parameters .",
    "( in case , when the retio of radiative strength functions of primary and secondary gamma - transitions is given on the basis of an additional information @xcite . )",
    "it describes a certain closed surface in the space of @xmath59 sought parameters .",
    "naturally , it is impossible to determine @xmath35 and @xmath36 unambiguous values from ( 2 ) even when all available information on the considered nucleus is used .",
    "however , in principle , it is always possible to determine approximately or precisely the interval of variation of @xmath35 and @xmath36 values , setting given values of @xmath41 , @xmath55 and other parameters of a particular nucleus .",
    "corresponding experiments have been carried out at the thermal neutron capture for 51 and analyzed without using hypothesis @xcite for22 nuclei .",
    "in @xcite techniques the maximum values of errors @xmath60 and @xmath61 of determined parameters are very strongly limited by the type of spectra measured in the experiment . therefore , they always have quite acceptable value @xcite for practically obtainable systematical errors @xmath62 of measured distributions of cascade intensities .",
    "it is just the obtained degree of accuracy of @xmath35 and @xmath36 values determined by @xcite that defines both the reliability of conclusion about factors determining the indicated nuclear parameters and possibilities to extract new information on properties of particular nuclei and , probably , on structure of initial cascade levels fixed by conditions of the experiment .    for the most efficient extraction of data on the influence of nuclear structure on @xmath0 and @xmath35 values from the experiment , it is also necessary to use all the information accumulated by theory on these parameters of nucleus . specifically , it is possible to separate two asymptotic variants of behavior of the congruent radiative strength functions .",
    "they appear when in an amplitude of gamma - transition dominate :    \\a ) quasiparticle components of wave function of initial and final states or    \\b ) their one- or two - phonon components .",
    "such possibility follows from the successful description @xcite of the experimental data for @xmath35 from @xcite by the superposition of partial level densities , determined by @xmath63-quasiparticle excitations with enhancement of the quasiparticle level densities of @xmath64 times at the phonon type excitations expense of the ofdomination .",
    "based on the main principles of fragmentation of nucleus compound - states @xcite , it is impossible to eliminate the probability of dominating of either one or another component in the neutron resonance structure",
    ". it is also impossible not to take into account the specific character of excitations of various types .",
    "quasiparticle excitations ( although with different number of quasiparticles ) are present at any excitation energy of nucleus .",
    "phonon ones , as it follows from the theoretical analysis of a.v .",
    "ignatyuk @xcite , most probably become excited at energies close to those of quadrupole ( octopole ) phonon and phonons of greater multipolarity . in other words the excitations of phonon type may provide a significant increase in radiative strength functions in the limited intervals of nucleus excitation energy .",
    "therefore , the excitations of quasiparticle type may rather well determine the basic part of radiative strength functions when gamma - transition energy is changing ( first of all  primary ) , whereas monophonon ( multiphonon ) one  determine a position of local region and the degree of increasing of strength functions in it .",
    "both variants @xcite of techniques use @xmath65 and @xmath66 unknown independent random functions to extract @xmath35 and @xmath36 from @xmath41 experimental values , as parameters of equation ( 2 ) .",
    "but near @xmath67 ( or smaller energy ) they necessarily fix @xmath68 ratio on the basis of the experimental data .",
    "the same refers to the level densities of positive and negative parity .",
    "unfortunately , variations of the obtained random functions are rather large . however ,",
    "due to the strong anticorrelation of pairs of the listed parameters , their sums fluctuate noticeably weak and , therefore , are quite informative .",
    "namely , these are well described by @xmath69 and @xmath70 functions , the parameters of which differ sufficiently weak at changing of masses of the studied nuclei or when their changing does not contradict the unconditionally set theoretical notions about nucleus .",
    "all practically applicable @xcite models of radiative strength functions consider nucleus as a monocomponent object . owing to the historically prevalent representations",
    ", it is viewed as a system of fermi - particles . moreover , though model @xcite considers nucleus only as fermi - liquid , it reproduces a series of parameters of the cascade gamma - decay process with better accuracy than is made possible by the simplest extrapolation @xcite of cross section of reverse reaction into the region of nucleus excitation below @xmath71 . by this reason ,",
    "it is appropriate to use the representations @xcite as basic in the performed analysis , because they are based on the most realistic notion about nucleus produced by theorists by now .",
    "a fraction of levels with purely dominating vibration components of wave functions ( at least lower than @xmath72 ) is very significant @xcite .",
    "however , the existing and practically used @xcite models of the radiative strength functions do not completely take into account this fact .",
    "therefore , at this stage of the analysis it is necessary to postulate the contribution of the vibrational nucleus excitations into @xmath0 values in a purely phenomenological way .    below it is accepted that for a spherical nucleus fraction of partial radiative width of dipole primary gamma - transitions with energy @xmath33 , specified by the quasiparticle excitations , is described by model @xcite : @xmath73 with two free parameters : @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "for the deformed one  by sum of two lorenz curves , respectively .",
    "fraction @xmath0 , supposedly connected with the vibrational nucleus excitations , is approximated by peak , shape of which is preset by two exponential functions : @xmath76 , @xmath77 for its low and high energy parts .",
    "a resolved single peak ( doublet or multiplet of peaks ) is observed , at least , in 30 out of 40 nuclei in the energy range of primary transitions @xmath78 mev . in these @xmath0 and @xmath35 values",
    "are simultaneously determined from cascade intensities with a moderate systematical error .",
    "exponential dependence of form of its peaks successfully describes all the data obtained by the present .",
    "parameter @xmath74 in ( 3 ) takes into account a possible change of nucleus thermodynamic temperature in form @xmath79 , whereas parameter @xmath75  net effect of changing in retio of levels fraction of quasiparticle and vibration types , both in the region of neutron resonances , and intermediate ( @xmath80 ) levels of nucleus . or it considers the fact of changing in ratio of quasiparticle and vibtation components in the normalization of wave functions of decaying and excited levels , respectively .",
    "such conclusion follows from the strong anticorrelation of amplitudes of local peaks in the experimental data on @xmath0 and their uninterrupted distribution ( approximated by function ( 3 ) ) .",
    "first of all the approximation of the experimental values of @xmath0 sums from @xcite is used in the analysis .",
    "when they are absent , those from @xcite are used .",
    "the results are presented in fig.1 - 4 for the main part of the studied by the present nuclei .",
    "particular values of the parameters by the approximating curve for all nuclei @xcite are given in the table .",
    "upon taking into account the type of compound state established by theory of components of wave function and laws of nuclear states fragmentation determining their value , the value of @xmath75 parameter is to a greater or lesser extent determined by the structure of the wave function of neutron resonance .",
    "this implies that @xmath75 parameter may change from resonance to resonance and , probably , correlate with values of their reduced neutron widths .",
    "proposed for all studied nuclei the simplest form of functional dependence of the sum of radiative strength functions provides rather accurate reproduction of the experimental data @xcite or @xcite in the energy interval of primary gamma - transitions @xmath81 mev . for many of them",
    "it is sufficient to postulate the existence of the single peak .",
    "however , when the experimental data for nuclei close to magic ones is taken into account , most probably there are no less than two local peaks in the radiative strength functions . positions of peaks well correspond to the region of step structure in levels density ( fig.5 ) .",
    "this circumstance in an ensemble with a wide variety of values of the adjusted parameter alpha in different nuclei is the basis for interpretation of increasing of the strength function in regard to model predicted value @xcite for those of @xmath82 mev .",
    "the excitation energy , corresponding to the positions of local peaks in the radiative strength functions of the considered nuclei ( for @xmath83 mev ) is compared with the threshold energy of appearing four ( five)-quasiparticle levels in fig.5 .",
    "taking into account unavoidable errors and ambiguity of the analysis @xcite , their complete compliance with the position of one of the peaks is observed . in the first approximation in the scale of @xmath84 the position of another one",
    "coincides with the energy of quadrupole phonons ( for example , about 1 mev for the deformed even - even nuclei ) or the region of mainly one- or two - particle levels in even - odd and odd - odd nuclei , respectively .",
    "amplitudes of peaks , supposedly caused by phonon excitations , for the most of analyzed nuclei are in a quite limited interval of values ( fig.6 ) . their noticeable increase is observed for @xmath2k , @xmath3co , @xmath85w , @xmath86os , @xmath25ir @xmath28hg .",
    "that is for nuclei close to the double magic ones with nucleon number @xmath87=20 , 28 and for those in the region about @xmath88=82 and @xmath58=126 .",
    "the best values of parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 , as it may be seen from fig.6 , obviously indicate smaller temperature of nucleus than the thermodynamic ones even near @xmath71 and significant decrease of a component @xmath0 by the approximating function ( 3 ) .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath74 and @xmath75 parameters very strongly correlate both with one another and with @xmath89 parameters in the region of the smallest energies of primary gamma - transitions .",
    "there are also no theoretical grounds to regard the form of local peaks as the only possible in strength functions . by this reason it is also impossible to exclude a possibility of an additional systematical error of @xmath74 and @xmath75 parameters .    in the proposed interpretation of the approximation data of radiative strength functions appearing of the local peaks",
    "is postulated by the presence of the amplified gamma - transitions on levels with the large phonon components of wave functions . if that is true , @xmath89 parameter may be determined by change rate of the nucleon correlation function in a heated nucleus . in fig.7 frequency distribution of this parameter",
    "is presented in nuclei of different nucleon parity .",
    "additionally , frequency distribution of @xmath90 value is given for even - even compound nuclei .",
    "( by positioning of maximum and width , it is close to an analogous distribution @xmath91 for nuclei with @xmath92 ) .",
    "the spread in @xmath89 values is maximal for even - odd nuclei and intermediate for odd - odd ones . assuming that @xmath93 , it is possible to determine that two unpaired nucleons of the single type decrease @xmath91 value by 25 - 50% at increasing of correlation function from one to three mev .",
    "a pair of neutron and proton quasiparticles decreases @xmath91 somewhat more intensely .",
    "its most decrease is observed for even - odd nuclei . in other words , in the region below the neutron binding energy the radiative strength function depends on the type and number of nucleons causing the appearance of excitations of quasiparticle type .",
    "by the present the most reliable systematical experimental data on sums of the radiative strength functions of dipole cascade gamma - transitions of the thermal neutrons capture may be approximated in the frames of the experiment unsertain in the @xmath81 mev region by a superposition of two components having rather different form of the dependence on energy of gamma - transition . at the present",
    "they may be interpreted only as a contribution of fermion and boson nucleus excitations into the partial radiative width , respectively .",
    "noticeable variation of the obtained parameters of @xmath94 dependence in nuclei of different masses may be caused by strong influence of the structure of cascade initial level on the correlation of contributions of nuclear common and superfluid states into the probability of gamma - quanta emission .",
    "this effect appears as an addition to the observed in @xcite strong influence of the intermediate level structure on this value .",
    "correspondingly , the radiative strength functions of primary gamma - transitions of the decay of compound states may be determined by the structure of levels connected by them at least up to the energy of neutron binding .",
