    "the behavior of green s functions in the infrared ( ir ) limit of yang - mills theories is of fundamental importance for the understanding of the low - energy properties of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , in particular for the problem of quark and gluon confinement @xcite .",
    "since the evaluation of these functions depends on the gauge condition , it is important to consider different gauges in order to obtain a clear ( possibly gauge - independent ) picture of color confinement .",
    "needless to say , this investigation should be at the nonperturbative level .",
    "a nonperturbative study of the qcd propagators and vertices from first principles is possible using lattice simulations .",
    "of course , on the lattice , the finite size of the system corresponds to an ir cutoff @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the lattice size .",
    "thus , a numerical study of green s functions in the ir limit usually requires a careful extrapolation of the data to the infinite - volume limit @xcite .",
    "another possible limitation for the simulations is the difficulty in finding an efficient numerical implementation of a given gauge condition .",
    "for this reason , most numerical studies of green s functions have been restricted to : landau gauge @xcite , coulomb gauge @xcite , @xmath3-gauge ( a gauge that interpolates between landau and coulomb ) @xcite and maximally abelian gauge @xcite . on the other hand , among the various gauge conditions that are very popular in continuum studies ,",
    "the so - called linear covariant gauge  which is a generalization of landau gauge  proved quite hostile to the lattice approach @xcite .",
    "let us recall that , in the continuum , the linear covariant gauge is defined by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the gluon field and the real - valued functions @xmath6 are generated using a gaussian distribution @xmath7 \\;\\sim\\ ; exp{\\bigl\\ { - \\ , \\sum_b\\ , \\left [ \\lambda^b(x ) \\right]^2 / \\ , ( 2 \\ , \\xi ) \\bigr\\ } } \\;\\mbox{. } \\label{eq : gaussian}\\ ] ] the feynman gauge corresponds to the value @xmath8 , while the landau gauge is obtained in the limit @xmath9 .    in the landau case ,",
    "the gauge condition @xmath10 can be obtained by minimizing the functional @xmath11 ^ 2 \\label{eq : landau}\\ ] ] with respect to the gauge transformations @xmath12 . in ref .  @xcite it was shown that a similar minimizing functional @xmath13 for the linear covariant gauge does not exist .    the no - go theorem proven in @xcite",
    "can of course be avoided by relaxing its hypotheses .",
    "the first possibility , explored in that reference , is to consider a different gauge , i.e.  @xmath14 \\ , = \\ , 0 $ ] with @xmath15=0 $ ] , for which a minimizing functional exists .",
    "in particular it was shown that minimizing the functional @xmath16 ^ 2               \\right\\ } \\label{eq : giusti}\\ ] ] implies the stationarity condition @xmath17 \\ , = \\ , 0 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the covariant derivative .    as noted previously @xcite",
    ", this method presents several problems .",
    "first of all , one can introduce spurious solutions , corresponding to @xmath19=0 $ ] for @xmath20 . in the above case , these solutions are the zeros of the operator @xmath21 .",
    "also , the second derivative of this functional does not correspond to the faddeev - popov operator @xmath22 of the usual linear covariant gauge .",
    "finally , the lattice discretization of the above functional is not linear in the gauge transformation @xmath23 .",
    "this makes the numerical minimization difficult and one has to rely on a specific discretization of the minimizing functional @xcite in order to make the lattice approach feasible .    a second possibility , recently presented in @xcite ,",
    "is based on avoiding the use of a minimizing functional @xmath13 , i.e.  on considering a lattice definition of the linear covariant gauge that coincides with the perturbative definition in the continuum . in this case , one first fixes the gluon field to landau gauge , i.e.  the transformed gauge field satisfies @xmath24 .",
    "then , one solves the equation @xmath25 and uses @xmath26 as a generator of a second gauge transformation . for small @xmath27",
    ", one then has that the gauge - transformed gluon field @xmath28 satisfies the condition @xmath29    the main problem in this case is that the method is correct only for infinitesimal gauge transformations , but usually @xmath26 is not small in a numerical simulation . as a consequence , one finds @xcite that the distribution of @xmath30 does not agree completely with the gaussian distribution of @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , in linear covariant gauge the longitudinal gluon propagator @xmath31 should satisfy the relation @xmath32 . with this approach one finds that , for small momenta , this is not the case @xcite .    here",
    "we present a new implementation of the linear covariant gauge on the lattice that solves the problems illustrated above , afflicting earlier methods .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe our new implementation and we report some tests of the algorithm used for the numerical gauge fixing . in particular , we show that @xmath31 is well described by @xmath33 , where @xmath0 is the gauge parameter , and discuss discretization effects .",
    "we also present preliminary results for the momentum - space transverse gluon propagator @xmath34 for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions .",
    "in order to find a new implementation for the linear covariant gauge on the lattice we notice that , when minimizing a functional @xmath35 , the gauge condition is given by the first variation of @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath37 ref .  @xcite has proven that there is no functional @xmath35 leading to eq .",
    "( [ eq : feynmancontinuo ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , one can remove an implicit hypothesis of the no - go condition , i.e.  that the gauge transformation @xmath23 appears in the minimizing functional in the `` canonical '' way @xmath38 .",
    "thus , we may look for a minimizing functional of the type @xmath39 instead of simply @xmath13 .    if one recalls that solving the system of equations @xmath40 is equivalent to minimizing the quadratic form @xmath41 , then it is clear that we should have @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the minimizing functional for the lattice landau gauge . here , the link variables @xmath44 and the site variable @xmath45 are matrices belonging to the su(@xmath46 ) group ( in the fundamental representation ) .",
    "we also indicate with @xmath47 the real part of a complex number and with @xmath48 the trace in color space .",
    "indeed , the lattice linear covariant gauge condition can be obtained by minimizing the functional @xmath49 to prove that this is the right functional we can consider a one - parameter subgroup @xmath50 $ ] of the gauge transformation @xmath23 . here , @xmath51 are the traceless hermitian generators of the lie algebra of the su(@xmath46 ) gauge group",
    ". they also satisfy the usual normalization condition @xmath52 .",
    "then , it is easy to check that the stationarity condition @xmath53 [ for all @xmath54 implies the lattice linear covariant gauge condition @xmath55 here , @xmath56 and , similarly , @xmath57 with @xmath58_{traceless } \\ ; . \\label{eq : discret}\\ ] ] note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : feynman ] ) implies that @xmath59 .    at the same time",
    ", one can verify that the second term on the r.h.s.of eq .",
    "( [ eq : efeynman ] ) does not contribute to the second variation of the functional @xmath60 with respect to the parameter @xmath61 .",
    "thus , this second variation defines a matrix @xmath62 that is a discretized version of the usual faddeev - popov operator @xmath63 .",
    "let us recall that , due to the gauge condition ( [ eq : feynmancontinuo ] ) above , in linear covariant gauge one has in general @xmath64 .    finally , let us note that the functional @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : efeynman ] ) is indeed linear in the gauge transformation @xmath23 .",
    "also , one can interpret the landau - gauge functional @xmath65 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : elandau2 ] ) above ] as a _ spin - glass _ hamiltonian for the _ spin _ variables @xmath45 with a _ random _ interaction given by @xmath44 .",
    "then , our new functional @xmath66 corresponds to the same spin - glass hamiltonian when a random external _ magnetic field _",
    "@xmath67 is applied .",
    "-14.8 mm -2.5 mm   convergence of the numerical gauge fixing . here",
    "we report the value of @xmath68 ^ 2 $ ] as a function of the number of iterations @xmath69 for @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "note the logarithmic scale on the @xmath73 axis .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] -10 mm    we have performed some numerical tests with the functional ( [ eq : efeynman ] ) , using the so - called _ stochastic - overrelaxation _",
    "algorithm @xcite .",
    "to this end we considered the 4d @xmath74 case at @xmath70 , for @xmath72 and @xmath75 , with @xmath76 and 0.5",
    ". the numerical gauge fixing seems to work very well in these cases ( see plot in figure [ fig : gfix ] ) .",
    "we also checked that the quantity @xmath77 is constant within statistical fluctuations in all cases considered . for @xmath78 and @xmath71 a fit of the type @xmath79 for @xmath31",
    "gives @xmath80 and @xmath81 with a @xmath82 .",
    "similar fits have been obtained in the other cases .",
    "the minimizing functional ( [ eq : efeynman ] ) in principle solves the problem of fixing the gauge condition ( [ eq : feynman ] ) . from the numerical point of view",
    ", however , one has to recall that the gluon field is bounded , at least when using the standard ( compact ) discretization .",
    "thus , while our method works wery well when the functions @xmath6 are generated using a bounded distribution , care must be taken in the usual implementation of the linear covariant gauge , where the functions @xmath6 [ see eqs.([eq : feynmancontinuo ] ) and ( [ eq : gaussian ] ) ] satisfy a gaussian distribution , i.e.  they are unbounded . this can give rise to convergence problems @xcite when a numerical implementation is attempted .",
    "of course the problem gets more severe when @xmath0 is larger .",
    "this is a common problem of all lattice realizations of the linear covariant gauge .    actually , in order to obtain the correct continuum limit @xcite , the functions @xmath6 are generated on the lattice , in the su(@xmath83 ) case , from a gaussian distribution with width @xmath84 , instead of the width @xmath85 .",
    "note that , for @xmath70 and @xmath86 , as in the previous section , one has @xmath87 .",
    "thus , for a given value of @xmath0 one can obtain a sufficiently small value for @xmath88 by considering large values of the lattice coupling @xmath89 .",
    "however , if @xmath89 is too large the physical volume will be too small ( for a given lattice size ) and one can not really probe the ir limit of the theory . on the other hand , for @xmath90 the lattice width @xmath91 is even larger than the continuum width @xmath85 . note that the situation is probably better in the @xmath92 case , since one has @xmath93 for @xmath94 , which corresponds to a reasonably large value of the lattice spacing @xmath95 .    of course , one can try to use different discretizations of the gluon fields in order to improve the convergence of the minimizing algorithms .",
    "besides the usual discretization ( [ eq : discret ] ) , we also did some tests with the `` angle '' projection @xcite and with the recently introduced stereographic projection ( or modified lattice landau gauge ) @xcite , using the so - called _ cornell _ method @xcite . in the last case the gluon field is in principle unbounded even for a finite lattice spacing",
    "indeed , our tests show that with this discretization one is usually able to simulate at slightly larger values of @xmath0 , for a given lattice volume @xmath96 and lattice coupling @xmath89 , compared to the other two cases . in particular , we tested these three discretizations using @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "we found that , while the usual discretization and the `` angle '' projection have problems with @xmath100 already at @xmath101 , the stereographic projection allows one to simulate with @xmath102 for @xmath103 .",
    "note that @xmath102 and @xmath104 corresponds to @xmath105 .",
    "-12 mm   transverse gluon propagator @xmath34 as a function of the momentum @xmath106 ( both in physical units ) for the lattice volume @xmath78 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] -10 mm    -2 mm      using the minimizing functional shown above and the stereographic projection , we have simulated at @xmath110 and @xmath107 for the lattice volumes @xmath111 and @xmath112 , for several values of the gauge parameter @xmath0 in the su(2 ) case . as a test of the gauge - fixing method",
    ", we have checked that the quantity @xmath113 , which should be equal to 1 , has a value of @xmath114 when averaged over all data @xmath31 produced .",
    "preliminary results for the transverse gluon propagator @xmath34 as a function of the momentum @xmath106 are shown in the figures [ fig : dt16 ] and [ fig : dt ] .",
    "there is a clear tendency of getting a more suppressed ir propagator when the lattice volumes increases , as in the landau case , and also when the value of @xmath0 increases .",
    "the latter result is in agreement with ref .",
    "also , the extrapolation to infinite volume , for a given @xmath89 and a fixed value of @xmath0 , seems in this case even harder than in landau gauge . indeed , as @xmath115 , the number of sites characterized by a large value for the function @xmath6 increases , making the convergence of the gauge - fixing method more difficult .",
    "one should recall here that , at the perturbative level , the gluon field @xmath116 and the gauge parameter @xmath0 are ( multiplicatively ) renormalized by the same factor @xmath117 , i.e.  @xmath118 and @xmath119 , where as usual @xmath120 and @xmath121 indicate bare and renormalized quantities respectively . on the lattice this implies that , in the scaling region , data obtained for two different values of @xmath89 , e.g.  @xmath122 and @xmath123 , can be compared and should give the same ( renormalized ) propagator only if the multiplicative factor @xmath124 relating the propagators ( see @xcite for the case of landau gauge ) also relates the gauge parameters @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "since the value of @xmath127 is not known a priori , one has to use some type of `` matching procedure '' in order to find pairs of parameters @xmath128 yielding the same continuum renormalized propagators .",
    "this is left to a future work @xcite .",
    "-12 mm   transverse gluon propagator @xmath34 as a function of the momentum @xmath106 ( both in physical units ) for the gauge coupling @xmath129 , @xmath107 , with the lattice volumes @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] -10 mm",
    "we presented a new lattice implementation of the linear covariant gauge by using a minimizing functional @xmath60 .",
    "tests have been done for the su(2 ) case in four space - time dimensions .",
    "this approach solves most problems encountered in earlier implementations and ensures a good quality for the gauge fixing with a ratio @xmath132 for all cases considered .",
    "we have also reported preliminary results for the transverse gluon propagator @xmath34 .",
    "the only open problem is how to extend these simulations to large lattice volumes , in order to probe the ir limit of the theory when the gauge parameter @xmath0 is also large .",
    "we stress that infinite - volume results for @xmath34 would of course be very important for comparison with analytic studies @xcite in the continuum . in any case , as mentioned above , the discretization effects are probably less severe for the su(3 ) group compared to the su(2 ) case .",
    "we are currently simulating other values of @xmath89 and @xmath0 in the 4d su(2 ) case and considering simulations also of the su(3 ) group and of the 3d case @xcite .",
    "finally , having a minimizing functional for the linear covariant gauge , which extends in a natural way the landau case while preserving all the properties of the continuum formulation , allows a numerical investigation of the effects of gribov copies on green s functions for the case @xmath133 .",
    "these studies will make possible a comparison to recent analytic results @xcite obtained in the limit of small gauge parameter @xmath0 .",
    "they could also be important for understanding how the so - called ( landau ) gribov - zwanwiger confinement scenario @xcite should be modified in the general covariant gauge . to this end",
