    "in the course of an extensive search for very wide , common proper motion companions to nearby hipparcos stars from the nomad catalog @xcite , we came across an optically faint and red star at an angular separation of @xmath5 , position angle @xmath6 from the active and rapidly rotating g9v star hip 115147 ( bd + 78 826 , hd 220140 , v368 cep ) .",
    "this faint star was subsequently identified with lspm j2322 + 7847 , a candidate nearby low - mass dwarf detected by @xcite from the lspm - north catalog @xcite .",
    "the original identification of this star as one with significant proper motion traces to luyten ( 1967 ) where it was reported as a magnitude 17 object with @xmath7 mas  yr@xmath8  at a position angle of @xmath9 and assigned the name lp12 - 90 .    in the present paper",
    "we present new @xmath2 photometry of hip 115147 , its known visual companion hip 115147b and lspm j2322 + 7847 , and obtain preliminary trigonometric parallax astrometry for the latter companion .",
    "then we discuss the possible young age and origin of this interesting triple system .",
    "following the identification of lspm j2322 + 7847 as a potential widely separated common proper motion companion to hip 115147 , @xmath2 photometry on the cousins system was obtained for the fainter star on ut 30 august 2005 using the 1.0-meter reflector at the flagstaff station .",
    "the photometry was calibrated with an instrumental zero point term and a first order airmass term .",
    "the calibration field was the standard field pg2213 - 006 from @xcite .",
    "additional photometric observations were subsequently obtained on ut 16 and 17 june 2007 when the individual components of the brighter system hip 115147ab ( sep .  11 \" ) were also measured .",
    "the photometric results are presented in table 1 along with @xmath10 photometry extracted from 2mass , proper motions from nomad and parallax determinations .",
    "the estimated uncertainties in the @xmath2 measures are @xmath11 mag in the case of lspm j2322 + 7847 and @xmath12 - 0.04 mag for the hip 115147 components where the short exposure times introduced additional error from scintillation and shutter timing .",
    "since the august 2005 photometry indicated that lspm j2322 + 7847 was most likely an m - dwarf at approximately the same distance as hip 115147 , it was added to the trigonometric parallax program at usno s flagstaff station . through june 2007",
    ", a total of 66 acceptable ccd observations have been accumulated on this field , covering an epoch range of 1.65 years .",
    "the same tek2k ccd , observational procedures , and reduction algorithms have been employed as summarized in @xcite . using a total of 29 reference stars , the current preliminary solution yields @xmath13 mas .",
    "this solution appears to be very robust , with the separate solutions for parallax in the ra and dec directions in very satisfactory agreement ( @xmath14 mas versus @xmath15 mas , respectively ) .",
    "correction to absolute parallax was performed using usno @xmath16 photometry for the individual reference stars along with a calibrated @xmath17 versus @xmath18 relationship to derive a mean photometric parallax of @xmath19 mas for the 29 star ensemble . together",
    "this then translates to @xmath20 mas for lspm j2322 + 7847 .",
    "the star hip 115147 was identified with the bright x - ray source h2311 + 77 , which led @xcite to suggest rs cvn - type activity .",
    "it was shown later on that the star is not evolved , and that it is not a short - period spectroscopic binary , justifying the currently accepted classification as a very young ,  naked \" post - t tauri dwarf @xcite .",
    "being one of the most powerful x - ray emitters in the solar neighborhood @xcite at @xmath21 ergs s@xmath8 @xcite , the star has the same space velocity as the local young stream ( or local association , @xcite ) .",
    "this association limits its age to @xmath22 myr .",
    "this stream includes isolated stars , groups and associations of diverse ages , some as young as 1 myr ( e.g. , in lupus and ophiuchus ) .",
    "therefore , the assignment to this stream by itself does not lend a more precise estimation of age .",
    "an x - ray luminosity of @xmath23 is typical of weak - lined tt stars in taurus - auriga - perseus , but significantly larger than that of classical tt stars ; if anything , it points at an age older than a few myr .",
    "hip 115147 is listed as variable star v368 cep @xcite .",
    "the slight variability allowed @xcite to determine the period of rotation of this star , 2.74 d. the fast rotation is responsible for the high degree of chromospheric and coronal activity .",
    "the primary star is identified as the extreme ultraviolet source euve j@xmath24 with strong detections at @xmath25 band , as well as at 250 ev in x - rays @xcite .",
    "hip 115147 is one of the 181 extreme - ultraviolet sources in the rosat wfc all - sky bright source survey identified with late - type main - sequence stars @xcite , with high signal - to noise detections in both @xmath26-@xmath27 and @xmath28-@xmath29 passbands .",
    "an unusually high level of chromospheric activity of @xmath30 was determined by @xcite ; a spectral type k2v is also specified in the latter paper as opposed to g9v given in the simbad database .",
    "since the rate of rotation diminishes fairly quickly with age in single stars , so does x - ray luminosity , and open clusters older than @xmath31 persei ( 50 myr ) are usually more quiescent than the youngest ones ( ic 2602 and ic 2391 ) .",
    "the high degree of chromospheric and extreme ultraviolet activity suggests a very young age , possibly less than 20 myr .",
    "v368 cep is more powerful in x - rays than an average k - type pleiades member by a factor of 10 , indicating an age less than 100 myr .",
    "finally , the equivalent width of at @xmath32    is smaller than the upper limit for the pleiades by @xmath33    according to @xcite , which points at an age similar to the pleiades or older .",
    "however , the lithium surface content is a poor estimator of age for young stars because of the large intrinsic spread of this parameter in stars of the same mass and age .",
    "we are left with the most reliable and frequently used method of age estimation by model isochrones . using the photometric data from the literature and our own ( table  1 ) , we plot hr diagrams in the 2mass @xmath34 and @xmath3 , and @xmath35 passbands in figs .",

    ", the theoretical isochrones at @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 myr are drawn from @xcite . according to the data in @xcite derived from strmgren _",
    "uvby@xmath39 _ photometry , the star hip 115147 has a markedly subsolar metallicity at [ fe / h]@xmath40 .",
    "this determination has to be taken with caution , because the photometrically derived metallicities are sensitive to the color index @xmath41 ( b. nordstrm 2007 , priv .",
    "comm . ) , which may be abnormally high for chromospherically active stars @xcite . a wider range of metal abundances is supplied in the evolution models of @xcite , and we present also a 25 myr isochrone for @xmath42 from their models in fig .  [ jk.fig ] with a dashed line .",
    "we find that the siess et al .",
    "50 myr isochrone ( @xmath43 ) provides the best fit for all three alleged comoving components ( marked with crossed circles ) , including the secondary m dwarf hip 115147 b , separated by @xmath44 from the primary @xcite .",
    "this pair is listed in the wds @xcite as wds 23194@xmath45 ( lds 2035 , discovered by luyten in 1969 ) , at separation @xmath46 and position angle @xmath47 .",
    "the relative position did not change significantly between the first ac2000.2 measures taken in 1901 and the latest epoch 2000 in 2mass ( w. hartkopf & g. wycoff 2007 , priv .",
    "comm . ) , confirming that the inner pair is physical .",
    "the small deviation of the faintest component lspm j2322 + 7847 from the siess 50 myr isochrone appears to arise mostly from a sudden twist of the isochrone at the latest data point corresponding to mass @xmath48 .",
    "we are not in a position to discuss if this twist has a certain physical meaning , but the overall match is good , and the estimated mass of the star is roughly @xmath48 .",
    "the younger isochrones for 16 and 7 myr from @xcite lie significantly higher in fig .",
    "[ jk.fig ] than the matching 50 myr isochrone .",
    "the 25 myr isochrone from @xcite at a lower metallicity provides a poor fit to our stars , predicting much bluer colors , but these models may be strongly biased for young ages as was found by @xcite for solar - type stars in the alpha persei open cluster at 52 myr .",
    "the members of the very young twa association are shown in fig .",
    "[ jk.fig ] with open circles .",
    "these stars are certainly much younger than hip 115147 and its companions .",
    "they appear to be brighter and redder than the 7 myr isochrone corresponding to the probable age of this group ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but this deviation may be the result of the near - infrared @xmath49 and @xmath34 excess commonly observed in classical t tauri stars and attributed to a hot inner rim in their dusty accretion disks @xcite . since our stars under investigation have no accretion disks and their metal abundance may be lower , we need to find a young star with similar parameters .",
    "it was pointed out by @xcite that a few young stars currently in the solar neighborhood , that traveled from the vicinity of the ophiuchus star forming region , share the moderately poor metal abundance of hip 115147 as determined from the _",
    "uvby@xmath39 _ photometry , probably affected by the high degree of chromospheric activity .",
    "one of these stars is the extremely active dwarf pz tel , a likely member of the @xmath39 pic associations estimated to be 12 - 20 myr old .",
    "this star is indicated with an open square in fig .",
    "[ jk.fig ] .",
    "its position matches the 16 myr , @xmath43 isochrone quite well .",
    "pz tel is significantly brighter than hip 115147 in @xmath3 having approximately the same color ; thus , the latter star and its companions are probably older than 16 myr .",
    "it is verified in fig .",
    "[ vk.fig ] that this difference in @xmath50 between the two stars is not originating in a @xmath3-band excess , since both hip 115147 and lspm j2322 + 7847 match best the 52 myr , @xmath43 isochrone in a @xmath50 versus @xmath51 diagram as well . the latter star is brighter in @xmath3 than the empirically determined main sequence for field dwarfs from @xcite by 1 mag . if this star were an unrelated old m6 dwarf , its distance would be only 12 pc .",
    "our trigonometric parallax ( table 1 ) yields a distance @xmath52 pc .",
    "a number of stars with outstanding signs of activity and young age scattered in the solar vicinity can be traced back to their places of origin in , or close to , the ob associations in the sco - cen complex @xcite .",
    "the star hip 115147 has come from the vicinity of the molecular cloud ldn 1709 in the ophiuchus star forming region , flanking the sco - cen complex at @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the closest approach to the estimated center of that association is 10.7 pc , while the separation today is 170 pc .",
    "the closest approach 16 myr ago saw the star flying by at a relative velocity of 10.8 km  s@xmath8 .",
    "if hip 115147 was born in the ophiuchus association , its probable age should be 16 myr , considerably younger than the previous isochrone analysis and the lithium abundance suggest .",
    "because of the high departing velocity , it is more likely that this close fly - by is a chance occurrence .",
    "finally , we note that the difference in proper motion between hip 115147 and lspm j2322 + 7847 , which appears to be statistically significant , may be caused by a systematic error of 5 to 10 mas  yr@xmath8   in the nomad proper motions for very faint stars .",
    "the formal errors specified in nomad may be strongly underestimated for this optically dim star , whose position at the mean epoch 1979 is based on schmidt plates . the proper motion difference , if it is true , implies that the two stars are not gravitationally bound as a truly multiple system .",
    "this is commonly observed among very young stars in the solar neighborhood ; for example , the common proper motion pair at mic and au mic ( approximately 10 myr old ) are separated by at least 0.23 pc and have proper motions different by @xmath54% , but their physical association is not in doubt . at the suggested age ( 20 - 50 myr ) , the hip 115147 companions are likely to stay close to each other as a moving group .",
    "more accurate absolute proper motions for both companions and spectroscopic radial velocities are required to clarify the dynamical status of the system .",
    "the currently available evidence is consistent with lspm j2322 + 7847 being one of the youngest , later - type stars in the near solar neighborhood .",
    "we thank t. tilleman and c. dahn for taking some of the parallax images .",
