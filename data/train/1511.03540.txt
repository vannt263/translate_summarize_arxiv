    "the situation is clearly unsatisfactory and requires clarification .",
    "we did not find any of these results convincing and present in this paper a more detailed analysis of the @xmath13 decays .",

    "so we do not confirm also the factorization results of @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported another estimate for @xmath243 based on naive factorization , neglecting the photon emission from the @xmath1-loop .- loop vanishes for the equal quark masses in the vector meson .",
    "the cancellation between the photon emission from the quark and from the antiquark of the @xmath1-meson occurs for the form factor @xmath113 , whereas for the form factor @xmath109 the amplitudes of these two subprocesses add to each other .",
    "] however , the huge form factors @xmath119 reported in @xcite clearly contradict the results from the large - energy effective theory @xcite and therefore the results of @xcite can not be trusted .    in conclusion , we believe that in comparison with the existing estimates @xcite credit should be given to our results : first , we take into account those contributions which have been neglected in @xcite but which are shown to give sizeable contributions to the amplitude .",
    "second , our calculation of the form factors is based on a more detailed model for the @xmath2-meson structure than the models employed in @xcite .",
    "taking into account the uncertainties mentioned above ( the scale in the wilson coefficients , making use of the factorization approximation for the weak - annihilation amplitude , uncertainties in the form factors ) , we estimate the accuracy of our theoretical predictions for the branching ratios ( [ br1])([br4 ] ) to be at the level of 20%",
