    "here it is necessary to note that ( [ e01 ] ) and ( [ e02 ] ) are defined in the same coordinate system .",
    "further , one can find another argument against the uniqueness of ( [ e01 ] ) .the vacuum einstein equations @xmath6 , @xmath7 are nonlinear second order differential equations .",
    "therefore , according to the general theory of differential equations@xcite one should have at least two constants of integration in the solution , but schwarzschild metric ( [ e01 ] ) has only one .    in this letter",
    "we would like to show that it is possible to construct more general metrics in the spherically symmetric and axially symmetric cases . because of the letter format we have to restrict the consideration only to the main results without proving the theorems , which we plan to do in the next paper .",
    "the question about the applicability of our results in brane models with noncompact extra dimensions and in astrophysics will also be discussed in subsequent publications .",

    "when @xmath11 ( the classical schwarzschild case ) it has the curvature singularity at @xmath14 and the coordinate singularity at @xmath15 ; 2 .   when @xmath16 it has only the coordinate singularity at @xmath17 { a^{3}-b^{3}}$ ] ; 3 .   when @xmath18 metric ( [ e03 ] ) is regular everywhere .",
    "the fulfillment of the last contention can be verified by the transformation to the kruskal - type coordinates @xmath19 where @xmath20{r^{3}+b^{3}}$ ] . accordingly , metric ( [ e03 ] ) takes the form @xmath21    it is necessary to call the reader s attention to the fact that formally ( [ e03 ] ) corresponds to all the metric requirements of the differentiable manifold only in the case @xmath18 . the case @xmath22 requires singular coordinate transformations , and that is not completely correct from the formal mathematical point of view while working with smooth manifolds",
