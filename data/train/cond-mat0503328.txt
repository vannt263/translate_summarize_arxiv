    "<S> evolution of a bose - einstein condensate subject to a time - dependent external perturbation can be described by a time - dependent bogoliubov theory : a condensate initially in its ground state bogoliubov vacuum evolves into a time - dependent excited state which can be formally written as a time - dependent bogoliubov vacuum annihilated by time - dependent quasiparticle annihilation operators . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that any bogoliubov vacuum can be brought to a diagonal form in a time - dependent orthonormal basis . </S>",
    "<S> this diagonal form is tailored for simulations of quantum measurements on an excited condensate . as an example we work out phase imprinting of a dark soliton followed by a density measurement .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum measurements on bose - condensed systems can give quite unexpected results . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the classic paper by javanainen and yoo @xcite a density measurement on a fock state @xmath0 with @xmath1 particles equally divided between two counter - propagating plane waves @xmath2 reveals an interference pattern @xmath3 with a phase @xmath4 chosen randomly in every realization of the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the fock state has a uniform single particle density distribution , but its measurement unexpectedly reveals interference between the two counter - propagating condensates . the fock state is a quantum superposition over @xmath1-particle condensates with different relative phases @xmath4 in their wave functions @xcite , @xmath5 , but every single realization of the experiment reveals such a density distribution as if the state before the density measurement were one of the condensates @xmath6 with a randomly chosen phase @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is best explained @xcite when the density measurement , which is a destructive measurement of all particle positions at the same time , is replaced by an equivalent sequential measurement of one position after another . with an increasing number @xmath7 of measured positions a quantum state of the remaining @xmath8 particles gradually `` collapses '' from the initial uniform superposition over all phases to a state with a more and more localized phase @xmath4 . for a large @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> a measurement of only a small fraction @xmath9 of all particles practically collapses the state of remaining @xmath8 particles to a condensate with phase @xmath4 . the lesson from this instructive </S>",
    "<S> example @xcite is that when we want to predict possible outcomes of measurements on a bose - condensed state , then it is helpful to rewrite the state as a superposition over condensates @xmath10 with different condensate wave functions @xmath11 in a hope that @xmath12 will give an approximate probability for different density measurement outcomes @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the set of all condensates @xmath14 is non - orthogonal and overcomplete , the `` amplitude '' @xmath15 is not unique but depends on coordinates used to parameterize the space of condensate wave functions @xmath11 . in general a special care </S>",
    "<S> should be taken to choose the right parameterization where the simple `` born rule '' @xmath12 gives the correct probability .    </S>",
    "<S> the existing literature about measurements on bose - condensed systems @xcite concentrates on simple most beautiful examples of bose - condensed states . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we construct for the first time a measurement theory able to predict probability of different density measurement outcomes on a realistic bose - einstein condensate of interacting particles evolving under influence of external time - dependent potentials . </S>",
    "<S> this problem is important because in many experiments , like phase imprinting of dark solitons @xcite or condensate splitting in atom interferometers @xcite , manipulation of the condensate generates substantial dynamical depletion which can qualitatively affect measured density patterns . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to being realistic our theory also reveals a beautiful diagonal structure hidden in the quantum state of a condensate excited from its ground state by a time - dependent potential .    a generic bose - einstein condensate consisting of @xmath1 weakly interacting atoms can be described by a number - conserving version of the bogoliubov theory @xcite which assumes that most particles occupy the condensate wave function . </S>",
    "<S> time - dependent problems can be treated with the time - dependent version of the theory where the condensate wave function @xmath16 evolves according to the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) and the bogoliubov modes @xmath17 and @xmath18 solve the time - dependent bogoliubov - de gennes equations ( bdge ) @xcite . in this framework , starting with a condensate in the ground state , time - dependent perturbation excites the condensate to a state which is formally a time - dependent bogoliubov vacuum @xmath19 annihilated by the time - dependent quasiparticle annihilation operators b_m(t )  =   . here the operator @xmath20 annihilates an atom in a condensate wave function @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the modes @xmath17 and @xmath21 are solutions of the time - dependent bdge projected on the subspace orthogonal to @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath23 , and normalized so that @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> in the time - dependent vacuum @xmath19 the reduced single particle density matrix ( r , r)= n_0^*(r)_0(r  )+ _ m=1^v_m(r ) v_m^*(r   ) , [ sing ] has common eigenstates with the operator = _ m=1^|v_mv_m |= </S>",
    "<S> _ n_|_^*_^*|  . </S>",
    "<S> [ drho ] a mode @xmath25 is a non - condensate eigenmode of the density matrix ( [ sing ] ) occupied on average by @xmath26 particles . thanks to the completeness relation _ </S>",
    "<S> m |u_mu_m|-_m |v_m^*v_m^*|=1 , [ complet ] valid in the subspace orthogonal to @xmath27 , the operator @xmath28 has common eigenstates with the _ </S>",
    "<S> m=1^|u_mu_m|= 1+d^*= _ </S>",
    "<S> ( 1+dn _ ) |__| . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore @xmath29 s allow us to get a diagonal form of = _ </S>",
    "<S> m|v_mu_m|= _ </S>",
    "<S> _ |_^*_| , [ hatdelta ] which is a map between the subspace orthogonal to @xmath27 and the subspace orthogonal to @xmath30 . indeed , the property @xmath31 of the bogoliubov modes and eq.([complet ] ) imply a quasi - commutator @xmath32 from which follows the diagonal form in eq.([hatdelta ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> what is more , owing to @xmath33 , one gets @xmath34 in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we have shown that in the stationary case the bogoliubov vacuum has the following form |0_b  ~   ( a_0^a_0^+ _ , = 1^z _ , _ </S>",
    "<S> ^_^ ) ^n/2   |0  , [ nz ] where @xmath35 s annihilate atoms in single particle states @xmath36 orthogonal to the condensate wave function @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> matrix @xmath37 fulfills the equation v_m|_^*=u_m| _ z _ , , [ z ] which is equivalent to the set of the conditions @xmath38 . in the stationary and time reversal invariant case </S>",
    "<S> all modes can be chosen as real functions so that the matrix @xmath39 is real symmetric and can be diagonalized by an orthogonal transformation @xcite . in a generic time - dependent case , or when a stationary @xmath22 breaks the @xmath40-invariance like in e.g. vortex state , </S>",
    "<S> the matrix @xmath41 is complex and symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> however , using only the general properties of @xmath42 and @xmath43 it is easy to show that the choice of @xmath29 s for the modes @xmath44 in eq.([nz ] ) makes the time - dependent bogoliubov vacuum diagonal |0_b  ~   ( a_0^a_0^+ _ = 1^_a_^a_^)^n/2   |0  , [ 0lambda ] where the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath41 are _ = . </S>",
    "<S> [ lam ] indeed , an action of @xmath45 on both sides of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ z ] ) yields @xmath46 equivalent to eq.([lam ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> hence the procedure of time evolution of the bogoliubov vacuum state in the particle representation becomes extremely simple : i ) first one has to evolve bogoliubov modes @xmath47 together with the condensate wave function @xmath22 which is easy because different modes evolve independently from each other . </S>",
    "<S> ii ) next one has to diagonalize the operator @xmath48 ( diagonalization of @xmath49 turns out to be better convergent numerically ) in order to get eigenvalues @xmath26 and eigenvectors @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> iii ) finally one calculates @xmath50 and from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lam ] ) obtains values of @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> note that there is a one to one correspondence between moduli of @xmath51 and the eigenvalues of the single particle density matrix @xmath26 : |_|==. however , the phases of @xmath52 s can not be determined from the single particle matrix only , but they also depend on the eigenvalues @xmath53 , see eq.([lam ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , once the phases are known it is convenient to make the transformation _= |_|  ,   _= _ e^12iarg ( _ )  . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we skip the primes .    for large @xmath1 the diagonal state ( [ 0lambda ] ) can be rewritten as a superposition over @xmath1-particle condensates @xmath54 with the normalized condensate wave functions @xmath55 the gaussian amplitude gives an accurate vacuum state when @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> the gaussian square of the amplitude p(q)~ _ e^-q_^2 [ pq ] is a candidate for the probability distribution for different @xmath57 . if this choice is correct , then simulation of the density measurement amounts to choosing a random set of @xmath57 s which determines the measured density ( r|q)= n|(r|q)|^2  . </S>",
    "<S> [ rhoq ] to show the correctness of eq.([pq ] ) , we average @xmath58 over @xmath59 and for @xmath60 we get the density ( r)= n|_0(r)|^2 + _ |_(r)|^2 [ rhoav ] averaged over different realizations of @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> this average density should be equal to the expectation value of the density operator in the state ( [ 0q ] ) 0_b|^(r)(r)|0_b= n|_0(r)|^2 + _ n_|_(r)|^2 [ rhoexp ] with @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> these two densities are the same for the highly occupied modes with @xmath63 or @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> there are discrepancies for poorly occupied modes but those modes give negligible contribution to the total density . </S>",
    "<S> the probability ( [ pq ] ) accurately reproduces the single particle density matrix . </S>",
    "<S> this accuracy can be best explained when we look at the overlap between condensates n:(r|q)|n:(r|q)= e^-_(q_-q_)^2  . </S>",
    "<S> condensates become orthogonal on the length scale of @xmath65 . for the highly occupied modes the fluctuations of @xmath66 are much greater than the width of the overlap and for these modes the overlap can be replaced by a delta function @xmath67 . with </S>",
    "<S> the delta overlap the condensates are orthogonal and the probability @xmath59 is simply given by the born rule in eq.([pq ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarize , a density measurement , which is a measurement of all atomic positions , can be approximately simulated in two steps . in the first step a condensate wave function ( [ phiq ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is chosen randomly from the gaussian distribution @xmath68 . in the second step atomic positions </S>",
    "<S> are measured in the chosen condensate . </S>",
    "<S> the first step already gives a smoothed density distribution @xmath69 on top of which the second step only adds statistical fluctuations . in most applications </S>",
    "<S> one is not interested in the statistical fluctuations but in the smoothed density obtained after filtering out the statistical noise , compare the histogram and the solid line in fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> thus for most applications the density measurement can be very efficiently and accurately simulated with only the first step of the procedure which immediately gives a smoothed density @xmath70 with randomly chosen @xmath61 s . in the following we give an example of this procedure : density measurement after phase imprinting of a dark soliton .    to describe evolution of the condensate wave function we solve the time - dependent gpe that in harmonic oscillator trap units reads i_t_0= -12_x^2_0 + _ 0 + g|_0|^2_0 + v(t , x)_0  . </S>",
    "<S> [ gpe ] here @xmath71 is an external potential created by the laser beam . as the effective 1d interaction strength </S>",
    "<S> we choose @xmath72 corresponding to parameters of the hannover experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dark soliton is a kink @xmath73 with the wave function winding a phase of @xmath74 as @xmath75 goes from negative to positive . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> the density drops to zero at @xmath76 explaining the name dark soliton . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally the soliton is excited by a short laser pulse which imprints on the wave function a phase that changes by @xmath74 when one goes from negative to positive @xmath75 . to simulate the phase imprinting we started with the ground state of the stationary gpe for a condensate in the harmonic trap , @xmath77 , and applied ( similarly as in ref.@xcite where they use rather small @xmath78 ) the perturbation @xmath79 $ ] ( where @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) that lasted for @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath83 was evolved up to @xmath84 ( or @xmath85ms ) . </S>",
    "<S> the density of the resulting wave function is plotted in fig  [ one](a ) where the dark soliton is clearly visible in the center of the trap .    </S>",
    "<S> the bogoliubov modes solve the time - dependent bdge i_t u_m&=&(h_gp+g|_0(x , t)|^2 ) u_m + g_0 ^ 2 v_m , i_t v_m&=&-(h_gp+g|_0(x , t)|^2)v_m - g_0^*^2 u_m , where @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> we have evolved the bogoliubov modes , starting with the eigenmodes of the stationary bdge for a condensate in the ground state , up to @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> the single particle density @xmath87 is plotted in fig .  [ one](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ one](c ) the densities of condensate , noncondensate atoms and the total single particle density are plotted . at both values of @xmath88 </S>",
    "<S> ( the realistic @xmath72 here and the @xmath78 in ref.@xcite ) the single particle density @xmath89 shows that minimum at the soliton location is gradually filled with particles depleted from the condensate . </S>",
    "<S> these dynamical studies confirm earlier predictions that a static soliton is going to fill up after a few milliseconds @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> after the evolution of the bogoliubov modes was completed we calculated the eigenvalues @xmath51 and the non - condensate eigenmodes @xmath90 at the final time . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the soliton notch is filled up with atoms depleted to only one mode : the @xmath91 with the largest @xmath92 . in fig.[two](d ) the total depletion density @xmath93 ( solid line ) is plotted together with a barely visible dashed plot of the @xmath94 . as the depletion in the soliton notch comes only from @xmath95 and because we would like to know what will be seen in the soliton notch in a single experiment we truncate the final time - dependent bogoliubov vacuum to @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> we made exact simulation of density measurement in the truncated vacuum using the algorithm of ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a typical outcome is shown as the histogram in fig.[two ] . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that every observed histogram can be very well fitted with the density @xmath97 where the only free parameter is @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> the histogram in fig.[two ] is fitted by the density @xmath99 shown in the figure as the solid line . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with our measurement theory predicting the smoothed histograms to be @xmath100 with a random @xmath98 . in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we derived a convenient diagonal form of the time - dependent bogoliubov vacuum which greatly facilitates simulations of quantum measurements on bose - condensed systems . </S>"
