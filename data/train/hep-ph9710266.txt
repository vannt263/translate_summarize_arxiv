    "polarized deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments have shown that the quark spins account for only a rather small fraction of the nucleon spin  @xcite , thus implying an appreciable contribution either from gluon spins or possibly from orbital angular momentum .",
    "competing explanations exist for this result , in which the polarized glue @xmath4 or the negatively polarized strange quarks @xmath5 lower the quark contribution to the nucleon spin . one way to solve this puzzle is to measure @xmath4 directly by studying , for example , polarized semi - inclusive processes , where the gluons enter in the initial state of the hard scattering sub - processes at lowest order in @xmath6 .    since the main hard scattering sub - process in dis is the virtual photo - absorption @xmath7 ( q - event , fig .",
    "[ fig : feydia]a ) , the measurement of inclusive polarized structure functions , like @xmath8 , does not allow the separation of the various parton components , and does not give direct access to the spin - dependent gluon distribution @xmath0 . in principle , the integral @xmath9 can be extracted indirectly from the qcd analysis of the @xmath10 dependence of @xmath11  @xcite .",

    "these qcd effects are not only clearly visible as @xmath12 jets at the hera collider  @xcite , but also in the event shapes and transverse momentum spectra of hadrons produced in dis at typical fixed target energies of @xmath13  @xcite . the unpolarized gluon distribution has been also extracted in a fixed target dis experiment from the event shape analysis of the events  @xcite .",
    "favorable conditions to measure @xmath0 are given , for example , in heavy flavor production  @xcite which proceeds via photon - gluon fusion ( pgf ) , and in the reaction @xmath14 high-@xmath15 jets @xmath16  @xcite which also proceeds via pgf ( fig .  [",

    "the latter measurement requires the detection of two jets with large transverse momenta ( @xmath17 ) . at the moderate energies of fixed target experiments the criteria for identifying jets are not unambiguous ( this is the case also at collider energies ) due to their large angular spread and low particle multiplicity . on the other hand , leading hadrons produced in dis",

    ", therefore far away from the kinematical regions with these collinear divergencies , where also the higher order corrections are presumably larger .",
    "this criterion is basically equivalent to the @xmath48 scheme used to regulate the divergencies in the matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "the most natural scales for the studied process are the transverse momenta @xmath46 of the outgoing partons in the c.m .. typically , they are chosen to be @xmath49 and varied between @xmath50 and 2 times this value .",
    "the parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) in qg- and qq - events are probed at a momentum fraction @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the energy of the virtual photon , and @xmath53 the nucleon mass ( note that @xmath54 ) . with a typical lepton beam energy of 200  gev these pdf s can be accessed in the region @xmath55 .",

    "acquire some transverse momentum , @xmath58 , with respect to the initial quark direction , which in the lund string model is usually parametrized with a gaussian distribution with @xmath59 and a harder tail at the one percent level  @xcite .",
    "hadrons acquire also part of their transverse momentum @xmath15 from the intrinsic transverse momentum , @xmath60 , of the partons in the nucleon ( @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the fraction of the parton energy carried by the hadron ) .",
    "the intrinsic @xmath60 is also parametrized with a gaussian distribution with @xmath63 . for hadrons emerging from q - events",
    "these are the only sources of transverse momentum , and the resulting @xmath15 drops off exponentially with @xmath64 .",
    "the experimental data at low @xmath15 are well reproduced by this description  @xcite .",
    "for example , the fraction of q - events with at least one hadron with @xmath65 is of the order @xmath66 .",
    "in contrast to this scenario , the @xmath15 spectra of hadrons emerging from events with an underlying first order qcd sub - process show a power law dependence and hence fall off much more slowly as seen in the experimental data  @xcite . in this case",
    "a considerable fraction of @xmath15 comes from the transverse momentum @xmath46 of the outgoing partons , and the intrinsic @xmath58 and @xmath60 will have only a minor effect on the @xmath15 s of the leading hadrons , provided that the @xmath15 is sufficiently large .",
    "so the direction of these hadrons in the partonic c.m .",
    "will approximately be that of the fragmenting partons ( see fig .",

    "the contribution to @xmath76 from the leading order diagram ( fig .",

    "simulations have shown that the ratio @xmath98 is rather stable with variations contained to within 10  % to 15  % of its value for different descriptions of the fragmentation process and various parametrizations of the unpolarized parton densities .",
    "the polarized quark densities @xmath188 are already known with a rather good precision of about 10  %  @xcite , and are expected to improve in the near future . assuming a rather generous error of 20  % for @xmath99 and 10  % for @xmath188 , we have estimated a statistical and systematical precision of about 5  % for @xmath75 from the measured @xmath184 and @xmath185 asymmetries for each @xmath159 bin .",
    "the precision on the extraction of @xmath75 is mostly affected by the compton background subtraction , which is larger in the @xmath178 channel compared to the @xmath116 one , where , on the other hand , the event yields are smaller",
    ". the simultaneous use of different charge and flavor combinations , and different kinematics of the hadron pairs will give a better determination of @xmath75 because of the different backgrounds involved , while the gluon densities remain the same .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the measurement of the cross section spin - asymmetry for two azimuthally anti - correlated hadrons of moderate transverse momentum @xmath15 of 11.5  gev/@xmath25 in polarized electroproduction on polarized targets offers a considerable sensitivity on the gluon polarization @xmath75 at momentum fractions @xmath80 around 0.1 .",
    "current models for @xmath4 predict experimental asymmetries of up to 20  % ( 5  % with realistic dilution assumptions ) and sufficiently large cross sections to achieve statistical accuracies in the 1  % region for one year of running of the compass experiment .",
    "this method should be seen as complementary to the measurement of spin asymmetries for open charm production discussed up to now  @xcite , since the systematic effects expected in the two processes are very different .",
    "the pgf process not only gives opposite signs for the asymmetry of the two processes but higher order qcd effects and hadronization effects will be very different .",
    "the new process offers the additional advantage that the parton kinematics can be , at least approximately , reconstructed from the observed hadron pairs",
    ". this will not only allow a direct measurement of the shape of @xmath0 over the range 0.04  0.2 , but also checks and corrections for model dependencies .",
    "the systematics for the @xmath4 determination from the hadron pairs are dominated by the poorly known fraction @xmath99 of pgf events in the total sample .",
    "usage of isoscalar targets reduces this to a dilution effect since the asymmetries of the relevant backgrounds are proportional to @xmath83 , which is very small in the relevant range .",
    "further studies , which are beyond the scope of the present paper , show that the simultaneous use of different selections of charge , flavor , and kinematics will narrow down the systematic error in the quantity @xmath99 .",
    "this can be seen , for instance , from figs .",
    "[ fig : yields ] and  [ fig : gluon ] which show that different selections of the hadron pairs provide us with different values for @xmath99 connecting the same basic quantities in eqn .",
    "[ eq : all2 ] .",
    "another major uncertainty stems from the use of only leading order processes in our estimates .",
    "we expect , however , that higher orders will not change the picture in a dramatic way since the relevant scales are of the order of 10  gev@xmath128 , comparable to the threshold for open charm production , and that the polarization asymmetries survive gluon radiation through helicity conservation .    in summary , the observation of a negative asymmetry in the proposed measurement will be a clear signature for a non - zero positive gluon polarization .",
    "the experiment will be also sensitive to very small gluon polarizations , up to five times smaller as currently discussed models .",
