    "point contacts between two superconductors have attracted interest for a number of reasons : they can be used to study the behaviour of a macroscopic quantum object @xcite as well as quantum transport when the junction consists of few atoms only @xcite .",
    "they may also help to extract information on the order parameter of compounds like the heavy - fermion superconductors , although those experiments are not as easy to interpret as has previously been assumed @xcite .    metallic point contacts of classical superconductors have first been investigated systematically by muller _",
    "they observed that , on reducing the contact area , the residual contact resistance @xmath1 at zero bias becomes finite and the critical current @xmath2 smaller than the theoretical value @xmath3 at a temperature @xmath4 even when the normal - state resistance @xmath5 is far below the quantum limit @xmath6 .",
    "this was attributed to the presence of electrical radio - frequency noise and additional damping of the junctions at high frequencies due to the small impedance ( that is the large capacitance ) of the current and voltage leads @xcite .",
    "the andreev - reflection excess current , on the other hand , was found not to depend on the lateral size of the junctions .",
    "we show here that the behaviour of those josephson junctions can better be described by the small capacitance @xmath7 typical for the three - dimensional point - contact geometry . taking into account the capacitance of the junctions as an adjustable parameter",
    ", we derive relations between @xmath8 and the residual resistance @xmath1 as well as the product @xmath9 , and estimate both the plasma frequency @xmath10 and the josephson coupling energy @xmath11 from the current - voltage @xmath12 characteristic at @xmath13 .",
    "our experiments on the classical superconductors lead , indium , aluminum , and cadmium fit the predictions fairly well . using the horizon model",
    ", the capacitance @xmath7 can be traced back to the properties of vacuum tunneling junctions in the normal state .",
    "the system of cooper pairs in a bulk sample forms one wavefunction @xmath14 .",
    "the gradient of the phase @xmath15 drives the current . according to b.  d.  josephson @xcite , by coupling two superconductors weakly to each other using a thin insulating layer between them , the phase difference @xmath16 across the junction results in a supercurrent",
    "@xmath17 as long as the voltage drop @xmath18 is much smaller than the superconducting energy gap @xmath19 . according to ambegaokar and baratoff @xcite the critical current of a josephson tunnel junction @xmath20 .",
    "the critical current through short metallic junctions between isotropic bcs - type superconductors was derived by kulik and omelyanchuk to be ( ko1 ) @xmath21 @xcite in the dirty limit ( electron mean free path @xmath22 much shorter than the superconducting coherence length @xmath23 ) , and ( ko2 ) @xmath24 @xcite in the clean limit @xmath25 .",
    "we will see below that quantum fluctuations of the josephson plasma can further reduce the critical current .",
    "the superscript 0 denotes then the above intrinsic value .",
    "the current - phase relationship of a metallic josephson junction in the clean limit deviates from the simple sinusoidal of a tunnel junction .",
    "it depends on the transmission coefficient @xmath26 as @xcite @xmath27 with @xmath28 . the normal - state contact resistance in the ballistic limit @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the fermi wave number and @xmath31 the contact radius .",
    "by varying the transmission coefficient , the junction can be tuned from pure metallic ( @xmath32 ) to pure tunnel ( @xmath33 ) behaviour .",
    "note the effects we are going to investigate do not involve an energy cost due to lateral confinement that could suppress the superconducting features in the contact region : although the junctions are rather small  with a typical metallic @xmath34 a @xmath35 junction has a contact radius @xmath31 of about 2 nm ",
    "the heisenberg uncertainty principle yields a spread with respect to momentum , and not one with respect to energy .      when the applied voltage @xmath36 , the phase does not change because @xmath37 , and the current through the junction is constant @xcite .",
    "if the voltage is finite , the phase increases at a rate @xmath38 , and the current has an oscillatory component at extremely high frequencies .",
    "d.  e.  mccumber @xcite and w.  c.  stewart @xcite took into account that besides the supercurrent across the josephson tunnel junction there exist also a normal quasi - particle current , described by a parallel resistance @xmath39 , as well as a displacement current due to a ( stray ) capacitance @xmath7 ( fig .  [ rcsj model ] ) .",
    "this capacitance is important for the properties of the junction because it represents a short circuit for the high - frequency part of the supercurrent .",
    "the total current of such a resistively and capacitively shunted junction ( rcsj ) is @xmath40 or @xmath41 with the plasma frequency @xmath42 and the characteristic frequency @xmath43 .",
    "the quasi - particle resistance @xmath39 is _ a priori _ unknown .",
    "generally , it will depend both on voltage , on current , or on phase .",
    "above @xmath44 , without josephson effect , the quasi - particle resistance equals just the normal - state contact resistance @xmath8 , originating purely from the quasi - particle current through the junction ( we assume there is no external shunt resistance ) . for a tunnel junction , this @xmath45 is proportional to the square modulus of the tunnel matrix element . for a ballistic junction , like the ones we are using",
    ", @xmath45 involves an infinite resummation of multiple quasi - particle transmissions through the contact .",
    "then , energy is not dissipated at the junction itself : electrons equilibriate far away from the junction in the bulk metal . by including non - linear effects like quasi - particle quasi - particle interactions or electron - phonon coupling ,",
    "the contact resistance , and thus @xmath45 , depends on temperature and the applied bias voltage @xmath18 .",
    "below @xmath44 , the situation changes completely as a josephson supercurrent can flow through the junction .",
    "however , well below @xmath44 there is no quasi - particle density of states within the energy gap @xmath46 on both sides of the junction .",
    "therefore , @xmath47 for an ideal junction at low bias voltage @xmath48 . at a josephson tunnel junction ,",
    "@xmath45 can be directly observed by suppressing the supercurrent using a small magnetic field less than the critical field .",
    "tunnel experiments have shown that the damping resistance can be much maller than the intrinsic quasi - particle resistance @xmath45 , see for example ref .",
    "this is probably due to parasitic damping of the high - frequency electromagnetic field generated at the junction .",
    "the quasi - particle resistance of a metallic josephson junction ( or point contact ) can not be measured directly , as far as we know .",
    "but it seems plausible , to apply the same arguing as for the tunnel junctions : for a clean bcs - type superconductor far below @xmath44 , the quasi - particle density of states has vanished in the vicinity of the chemical potential , and therefore the intrinsic @xmath47 .",

    "they are therefore only weakly damped , and anomalies which we have attributed tentatively to the excitation of bloch waves , zener tunneling of the quasi - charge , and zener tunneling of the phase become plausible even though the normal - state resistance of the junctions is less than @xmath316 .",
