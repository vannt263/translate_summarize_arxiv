    "the spin polarization of charge carriers in nanostructures is an important issue for both electronics and new field of condensed matter physics known as spintronics.@xcite one of the problems being actively studied nowadays is the control on spin ( in general , magnetic moment ) degrees of freedom for the carriers participating in the electron transport , optical , magnetization , etc",
    ". phenomena .",
    "the classical and approved way to achieve this goal is the application of external magnetic fields which is successfully used both in fundamental experiments and in commercial device structures . with all its advantages the application of external magnetic field is not always desirable for the technological purposes .",
    "hence , alternative methods of spin control are interesting for both fundamental and applied issues",
    ". one of them is the consideration of the spin - orbit ( so ) coupling in those semiconductor nanostructures where it can produce measurable and potentially usable effects .",
    "one type of the so coupling in heterostructures is the rashba coupling@xcite coming from the structure inversion asymmetry of confining potential and effective mass difference .",
    "it is important for the experimental purposes that the value of rashba coupling strength can be tuned by the external gate voltage@xcite and reaches the value of @xmath0 evm in inas - based structures@xcite with two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) which makes its influence to be quite substantial . besides , the dresselhaus term@xcite originating due to the bulk inversion asymmetry is also present in the most commonly used types of heterostructures .",
    "the ratio between the rashba term with strength @xmath1 and dresselhaus term with strength @xmath2 can be as small as @xmath3 which was reported in the photocurrent experiments.@xcite hence , it seems reasonable to include both rashba and dresselhaus terms for more accurate description of the so coupling in these structures .",
    "the inclusion of both terms will be further justified if one can find an effect which is sensible to the particular form of the so coupling .    in the great variety of spin - dependent properties",
    "the problem of field - induced carrier polarization which accompanies the charge current flow is one of the central ones .",
    "since the pioneer work by datta and das on the concept of spin field - effect transistor@xcite it attracts considerable attention , and one of the key issues is the spin polarization induced by an external electric field in the presence of the so coupling.@xcite apart from the great variety of the results on the challenging problem of spin current , one can mention the calculations of spin susceptibilities,@xcite the spin polarizations in a bar@xcite or in the t - shaped conductor,@xcite the interplay between spin and hall charge current,@xcite the spin accumulation in a quantum wire device,@xcite the pumping of charge current by spin dynamics,@xcite and the dynamics of localized spins coupled to the conduction electrons,@xcite the injected current - control@xcite and detection@xcite of spin accumulation,@xcite the spin gunn effect,@xcite and a recent proposal of the spin current diode.@xcite another important problem is a possible influence of random nanosize domains of the so coupling formed due to the imperfections of the structure @xcite which can give rise to the spatially non - uniform character of so terms leading to the electron spin precession @xcite and the effects referred to the field of spin optics.@xcite    one of possible ways to create a non - uniform spin distribution in a heterostructure is to apply a metal - gated superlattice with tunable amplitude of electric potential to the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with the so coupling .",
    "it was shown by kleinert , bryksin and bleibaum that in the presence of rashba so coupling the external electric field yields and enhanced spin polarization in a superlattice with a single spin - split band.@xcite in addition to the total polarization of the sample , one can be interested in calculating the local polarization ( or spin density ) at the point of a real space which may be actually probed by a detector .",
    "it is known that the states with inhomogeneous distribution of spin density can exist and , which is important , can have long spin relaxation time.@xcite it was shown that such states can be found in a 1d superlattice with rashba so coupling demonstrating a non - uniform distribution of spin density for a given state @xmath4 , i.e. , showing a spin texture.@xcite of course , under the equilibrium conditions the contributions to the local spin density from all states below fermi level cancel each other since the populations of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 states with the opposite spin projections in a system without magnetic order are equal . however , in the presence of symmetry breakup during scattering@xcite or in a non - equilibrium conditions created by an external radiation@xcite one can observe various and controllable spin textures along the superlattice cell .",
    "hence , it seems also promising to look at the spin polarizations of the charge current and the the spin textures created by an external dc field applied to the superlattice .    in the present paper",
    "we study the dc current , the spin polarization , and the spin textures in the 1d gated superlattice with simultaneous presence of both rashba and dresselhaus so terms .",
    "the shape of spin textures is calculated as a function of the applied electric field for fixed values of rashba and dresselhaus so amplitudes @xmath1 and @xmath2 and also as a function of @xmath6 ratio at fixed electric field and in the interval of @xmath6 covering rather wide range of semiconductor materials .",
    "we consider the finite parameters of collision rate and temperature which appear to be non - destructive for the calculated current and spin characteristics depending on all states below the fermi level .",
    "the knowledge of field - induced spin textures in addition to the spin polarization and charge current may be instructive for both fundamental and applied issues of low - dimensional semiconductor structures with strong so coupling .",
    "it will bee seen that the principal results of the paper regarding the generation of spin textures in a superlattice can be obtained in a rather elementary model . in this model",
    "a simple stationary kinetic equation is considered with a constant relaxation time and all the calculations of the physical quantities based on the knowledge of bloch spinors and the miniband spectrum while keeping in mind that a more general formalism of spin density matrix can also be applied for more detailed studies.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we briefly describe quantum states and spin polarizations in the minibands of a superlattice with rashba and dresselhaus so coupling . in sec.iii",
    "we write down the kinetic equation for the distribution function in the presence of the dc electric field and solve it numerically .",
    "the distribution function is used for obtaining the charge current and the mean spin projections as well as the spin textures . in sec.iv",
    "we calculate and discuss the spin textures for both fixed rashba and dresselhaus amplitudes and for varying @xmath6 ratio .",
    "the concluding remarks are given in sec.v .",
    "in this section we shall briefly describe the quantum states of 2deg with rashba and dresselhaus so coupling subject to a one - dimensional ( 1d ) periodic superlattice potential .",
    "a model involving only the rashba contribution to the so coupling and a superlattice potential has been derived previously@xcite and applied to the problem of scattering@xcite and optical excitation of spin textures.@xcite the hamiltonian is the sum of the 2deg kinetic energy operator in a single size quantization band with effective mass @xmath7 , the rashba and dresselhaus so terms with amplitudes @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , and the periodic electrostatic potential of the 1d superlattice :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 and the periodic potential is chosen in the simplest form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the superlattice period and the amplitude @xmath12 can be tuned by the gate voltage .",
    "the eigenstates of hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) are two - component bloch spinors with eigenvalues labeled by the quasimomentum @xmath13 in a one - dimensional brillouin zone @xmath14 , the momentum component @xmath15 , and the miniband index @xmath7 :    @xmath16     evm and the dresselhaus term @xmath17 evm .",
    "the other parameters are the electron effective mass @xmath18 @xmath19 , the superlattice period and amplitude @xmath20 nm and @xmath21 mev.,width=321 ]    here @xmath22 and @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "the energy spectrum of hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) consists of pairs of spin - split minibands .",
    "the spacing between two minibands in a pair is mainly determined by the so parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 while the miniband widths and the gaps in the spectrum are of the order of the superlattice potential amplitude @xmath12 .",
    "an example of the energy spectrum is shown in fig.[figband ] for the four lowest minibands in the inas - based 1d superlattice with rashba parameter @xmath24 evm plus the dresselhaus so term with the amplitude @xmath17 evm . here",
    "the ratio @xmath25 corresponds to the one measured in the photocurrent experiments on inas - based structures.@xcite the cited experiments have shown that the ratio @xmath6 for the most widely used 2d structures varies from @xmath26 for gaas / algaas and @xmath27 for inas / inalas quantum wells to @xmath28 in a single gaas / algaas heterojunction .",
    "one can see from table i in ref.@xcite that none of the samples have shown a negligible impact of the dresselhaus term and hence this contribution should be included in the so part of the hamiltonian .",
    "the other parameters are the inas electron effective mass @xmath18 @xmath19 , the superlattice period @xmath20 nm and the amplitude of the periodic potential @xmath21 mev .",
    "it should be noted that the spectrum in fig.[figband ] is limited to the first brillouin zone of the superlattice in the @xmath13 direction while the cutoff in the @xmath15 direction is shown only to keep the limits along @xmath13 and @xmath15 comparable .",
    "the minibands in fig.[figband ] have an inversion symmetry @xmath29 but they do not have an additional symmetry with respect to the change @xmath30 if both rashba and dresselhaus terms are present .",
    "this feature is very important for the symmetry analysis of the present structure as well as for the induced spin textures since the absence of the additional symmetry plane perpendicular to the @xmath31 axis allows the generation of @xmath32 and @xmath33 components of spin density for the @xmath34-oriented electric field , as we shall see below in sec.iv .",
    "another argument for the consideration of the lowest available symmetry of the so term is the possible influence of random nanosize domains of the so coupling which can be present due to the imperfections of the structure.@xcite    an external electric field changes the occupation distribution in the reciprocal space and thus it may produce a non - compensated impacts from states with different quasimomenta to the local spin densities from the symmetrical points in @xmath4-space .",
    "hence , it is instructive to take a look at the spin polarization described by a vector field @xmath35 in the @xmath36 plane .",
    "each of the mean spin projections is given by    @xmath37    and is calculated for each miniband separately with a given @xmath38 .",
    "the spin vector field is two - dimensional since for both rashba and dresselhaus terms the mean value of @xmath39 is zero .",
    "we are interested in the topological structure of vector field ( [ sk ] ) in each miniband since it can provide a justified estimation about the measurable local spin density which can be induced by an external electric field .",
    "is marked by black circles ) ( a ) in the two lowest and ( b ) in the next miniband of spectrum in fig.[figband ] with the presence of both rashba and dresselhaus so coupling terms with the amplitude ratio @xmath40.,width=321 ]    in fig.[fsk2 ] the vector field @xmath35 is shown schematically for two lowest superlattice minibands with the same parameters as in fig.[figband ] with both rashba and dresselhaus so terms . in can be seen from figures [ figband ] and [ fsk2 ] that the periodicity of the superlattice along @xmath34 leads to the same property in the @xmath4 - space for both energy and spins with the reciprocal lattice vector @xmath41 . in each miniband",
    "the relation    @xmath42    is satisfied , so in equilibrium at each point in the real space the contribution @xmath43 is compensated by the term @xmath44 leaving the sample non - magnetic .",
    "if an external electric field is applied along @xmath34 direction , the relation ( [ seq ] ) is no longer satisfied , and one can find a non - zero spin accumulation at the edges of the sample . in the next sec .",
    "we shall calculate this quantity in the presence of the electric field oriented parallel to the superlattice direction @xmath34 for rashba plus dresselhaus types of so coupling .",
    "the field - induced distribution of spin density and the charge current can be calculated with the non - equilibrium stationary distribution function @xmath45 in the miniband @xmath7 which depends only on the momentum if the stationary and uniform external electric field @xmath46 is applied along the @xmath34 direction of the superlattice .",
    "we shall neglect possible non - uniform character of the distribution function in a real space arising due to the strong non - linearity at high electric field and resulting to the current and the charge domains of instability .",
    "still , our calculations will include the electric fields high enough to see the non - linear dependence of both the induced spin densities and the current on the applied field strength .    in the collision frequency approximation",
    "the kinetic equation for @xmath45 under the conditions described above has a simple form    @xmath47 , \\label{kineq}\\ ] ]    where @xmath48 is the collision rate and @xmath49)$ ] is the fermi equilibrium distribution function in the @xmath7th miniband . in the following",
    "we shall assume that @xmath50 k and @xmath51 @xmath52 which corresponds to the thermal and collision broadening of @xmath53 and @xmath54 mev , respectively .",
    "the position of the fermi level can be tuned by the gate voltage and we assume @xmath55 mev counted from the bottom of the electron size quantization band .",
    "such broadening parameters are typical in the experiments and produce significant smearing of the so - split miniband structure shown in fig.[figband ] . however , the charge current , the mean spin values , and the local spin density are determined by the contributions from all occupied states which makes it survivable under this scale of broadening . by substituting the dispersion relation @xmath56 obtained in the previous sec . for each miniband , the kinetic equation ( [ kineq ] ) can be solved directly for the given strength of the electric field @xmath46 , allowing one finding the charge current and the spin density .",
    "the application of an external electric field generates the charge current through the superlattice . in the presence of the electric field",
    "@xmath46 applied along @xmath34 the charge current @xmath57 and the mean spin values @xmath58 can be calculated directly after obtaining the distribution function from eq.([kineq ] ) :    @xmath59    @xmath60     structure with electron density @xmath61 and with all other parameters as in fig.[figband].,width=321 ]    where @xmath62 , and the summation is performed over all minibands @xmath7 and all values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fjs](a ) for the charge current and in fig.[fjs](b ) for the mean spin values .",
    "the current in fig.[fjs](a ) is calculated for a @xmath63 structure with 2deg concentration @xmath61 and with all other parameters as for the band structures in fig.[figband ] .",
    "it can be seen from fig.[fjs](a ) that the low - field ohmic resistance of such structure is about @xmath64 .",
    "another well - known feature of the plots in fig.[fjs ] is the progressive non - linear dependence of the maximum current and spin amplitude which can be seen at high electric field ( greater than @xmath65 ) .",
    "such non - linearity is common for all field - induced quantities in superlattices and is significant when the stark frequency @xmath66 becomes comparable with the collision frequency @xmath48 .",
    "it is known that in the presence of rashba so term the only non - vanishing component of the @xmath46 electric field - induced accumulated spin is @xmath67.@xcite in the presence of both rashba and dresselhaus terms the @xmath68 component can also be nonzero , as it is evident by looking onto the topology of the spin vector field in fig.[fsk2 ] .",
    "this topological aspect is confirmed by the calculations of mean spin value dependencies on the electric field which are shown in fig.[fjs](b ) .",
    "one can see that @xmath68 and @xmath67 can have an equal magnitude as long as the dresselhaus term is comparable to the rashba term .",
    "thus , the consideration of both rashba and dresselhaus terms seems to be important for the calculation of non - vanishing spin components measured experimentally .",
    "another spin - related quantity that we shall discuss below and which is actually measured in the experiments is the local spin density in a real space determined by all states below the fermi level .",
    "we shall see that this spin densities can be spatially non - uniform in the presence of the superlattice potential .",
    "since the so coupling is present , the spin polarization of charge carriers may also take place , resulting in a spin accumulation in a superlattice.@xcite the spin - related quantity which can actually be probed by a tip in the experiment or possibly utilized in a spintronic nanostructure device is the local spin density in a real space , which manipulation is one of the primary goals of spintronics . the local change of the spin density is often referred to the conception of a spin current which permanently attracts a considerable attention of researchers@xcite ( only few papers from a great number of published articles on the spin current are cited here as an example ) , and where the different definitions have been proposed .",
    "taking into consideration the goals of the present paper , one should mention that the experimental studies of the spin current phenomena are presently focused on the observation of spin accumulation .",
    "indeed , one can observe an equal change of local spin density caused by two different processes : the first one is the transport of spin - polarized charge carriers while the second one is the local `` rotation '' of spins which is not always accompanied by the carrier transfer . in both cases",
    "the actually measured observable is the local spin density which change , as we see , does not strictly require involving the conception of spin current . the problem of the spin current definition remains to be one of the hottest topics on spintronics since the work of rashba@xcite where the possibility of the existence of spin currents even in the equilibrium has been demonstrated .",
    "the different possibilities of local spin evolution are reflected also in the non - conservation of the spin in terms of the continuity equation @xmath69 . if the spin current density is defined as @xmath70 $ ] , than one has to introduce the torque density @xmath71 \\psi \\right]$ ] in the right side of the continuity equation .",
    "it was shown that this equation takes the usual form with zero in the right side if another definition @xmath72 of spin current is considered.@xcite the proper and uniform definition of spin current based on the measurable quantities is still under discussion , and the goal of the present paper is the local measurable spin density rather than the spin current .",
    "hence , below we shall focus on the electric field - induced local spin density which is non - uniform in the superlattice cell and thus can be referred as the spin texture .",
    "it should be stressed that this texture accompanies the charge current and thus provides the information about the tunable spin polarization of the electrical current which is of big importance for possible device applications .",
    "the rashba and dresselhaus so terms in a hamiltonian of the free particle produce a spin polarization for the plane wave spinor @xmath38 with a given @xmath4 which has a uniform spin density distribution in the real space .",
    "if an additional superlattice potential is applied , the spin density for @xmath73 in the @xmath7th miniband becomes non - uniform and forms the spin texture.@xcite in the equilibrium conditions the spin densities from all states below @xmath74 cancel each other which leads to zero spin density in any point of the real space .",
    "if the equilibrium is destroyed by an external electric field , one can expect to measure not only the non - zero spin accumulation@xcite but also the local spin density which varies along the superlattice cell and forms variable spin textures which shape can be modified by manipulating the system parameters .",
    "-component ( b ) @xmath31 -component and ( c ) @xmath75 - component shown in one superlattice cell @xmath76 for the field interval @xmath77 .",
    "the textures for two limiting cases with @xmath78 and @xmath79 as well as for the fixed rashba / dresselhaus ratio @xmath80 corresponding to inas - based structure are shown .",
    "the temperature @xmath50 k , the collision rate @xmath51 @xmath52 , and all other parameters are the same as in fig.[figband].,width=302 ]     and @xmath81 transformations , leading to a high degree of cancellation of the spin textures from the neighboring subbands induced by the electric field @xmath46 .",
    "( b ) the same for the presence of both rashba and dresselhaus terms where the spectra are invariant only with respect to the @xmath82 transformation , leading to the increasing differences in the energy dispersion shapes and creating a much smaller degree of cancellation from the neighboring subbands , thus increasing the spin texture amplitude ( see fig.[frd]).,width=302 ]    in this subsection we are interested in calculating the spin density @xmath83 along the superlattice cell as a function of the electric field strength @xmath46 .",
    "if the electric field is applied along @xmath34 than the density depends only on @xmath34 in the real space since in the @xmath31 direction the system is totally homogeneous . after obtaining the distribution function from eq.([kineq ] ) , one can write    @xmath84    where the summation and integration are performed over all minibands @xmath7 and all values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the results can be presented in a form of a 3d plot showing each of the spin density components @xmath85 separately as a function of the position @xmath34 inside the superlattice cell and the electric field strength @xmath46 .    in fig.[frd",
    "] we show the field - induced spin textures in a 2deg for two limiting cases with @xmath78 and @xmath79 as well as for the fixed rashba / dresselhaus ratio @xmath80 , taking all other system parameters as in fig.[figband ] .",
    "the plots in fig.[frd ] and below in fig.[fratio ] show each component of spin ( @xmath86 in part ( a ) , @xmath87 in part ( b ) and @xmath88 in part ( c ) ) separately on the vertical axis calculated as a @xmath89 function of the position @xmath34 in a superlattice cell ( @xmath34 axis ) and of the applied electric field ( @xmath46 axis in fig.[frd ] ) or of the @xmath6 ratio ( @xmath6 axis in fig.[fratio ] ) . at zero electric field",
    "the structure is maintained in the thermodynamic equilibrium with equal population of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 states in the reciprocal space having the opposite spin projections .",
    "thus , without the electric field - induced imbalance of this population the structure is not expected to demonstrate non - zero spins in any point of the real space , i.e. the spin textures in our system have a non - equilibrium origin .",
    "the most striking feature of spin textures in fig.[frd ] is the big amplitude difference of the field - induced spin texture components @xmath32 and @xmath90 for limiting cases @xmath78 and @xmath79 and for a general case @xmath80 while the @xmath33 amplitude is rather unaffected by the @xmath6 variations .",
    "the explanation of this effect is coming from the symmetry considerations as well as from the analysis of the so superlattice subband energy spectrum which is presented schematically in fig.[fexplain ] .",
    "first of all , it should be mentioned that in the superlattice with so coupling the energy subbands always come in pairs . inside each pair",
    "the dispersion surfaces are relatively weakly split by the so coupling ( see fig.[figband ] ) and their contributions to the induced spin textures are in generally of the opposite sign ( see fig.[fsk2 ] ) . in order to illustrate this we plot in fig.[fexplain](a ) a very simple schematic view of mean spin alignment in the @xmath4-space for two so - split superlattice subbands for pure rashba ( solid arrows ) and pure dresselhaus ( dashed arrows ) so coupling which energy spectra are symmetrical with respect to both @xmath91 and @xmath81 transformations , leading to a high degree of cancellation of the field - induced spin textures from the neighboring subbands . in fig.[fexplain](b )",
    "the same view is shown for the presence of both rashba and dresselhaus terms where the spectra are invariant only with respect to the @xmath82 transformation , leading to the increasing differences in the energy dispersion shapes and creating a much smaller degree of cancellation from the neighboring subbands , thus increasing the spin texture amplitude ( see fig.[frd ] ) .",
    "the treatment of @xmath33 component of spin textures can not be handled in the same way since its mean value for a quantum state of our hamiltonian is zero , meaning that the condition    @xmath92    is always fulfilled .",
    "the local non - zero @xmath88 component is formed by the effective magnetic field @xmath93 $ ] arising due to the superlattice potential @xmath94 .",
    "since this potential is periodic , the mean value of its gradient is zero which is reflected in eq.([szero ] ) .",
    "these general properties of the local non - zero @xmath88 component are related only to the spatial dependence of the superlattice potential and on the applied electric field and thus they should not depend strongly on the precise value of rashba / dresselhaus ratio as long as the so coupling is present .",
    "this expectation is consistent with the plots for @xmath88 in fig.[frd](c ) where the textures for three different sets of parameters are very close to each other . since the local spin density is an actually measurable quantity in the experiments ,",
    "the creation of field - induced spin textures in superlattices with both rashba and dresselhaus so terms should be taken into consideration for possible experimental and device purposes .",
    "now we shall consider the dependence of spin texture components on the ratio @xmath6 of rashba and dresselhaus contributions to the so coupling when the electric field strength @xmath95 v / cm is fixed in a low - field regime of the interval in figures [ fjs],[frd ] which is more desirable for practical purposes .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath6 can be estimated from the actual photocurrent experiments data@xcite where in different structures constructed from different materials this ratio has been reported to vary from @xmath26 to @xmath28 . taking this into consideration",
    ", we shall restrict ourselves to the interval @xmath96 . keeping all other parameters of the system unchanged",
    ", we obtain the @xmath6 - dependencies of spin texture components in a superlattice cell which are shown in fig.[fratio ] .",
    "the point `` a '' on the @xmath6 axis corresponds to the example of inas - based structure with @xmath80 considered in the previous parts of the paper , and the position of the vertical axis is displaced for a better view .     of the spin textures in the superlattice cell @xmath76 for ( a ) @xmath34-component ( b ) @xmath31 -component and ( c ) @xmath75 - component induced at fixed electric field @xmath97 v / cm .",
    "the point `` a '' corresponds to the example of inas - based structure with @xmath80 considered above .",
    "all other parameters are the same as in fig.[frd ] and fig.[figband ] .",
    "the electric field - induced spin textures have the biggest amplitudes in a region of comparable rashba and dresselhaus contributions to spin - orbit coupling.,width=283 ]    first , let us examine the lower part of the interval when @xmath98 , i.e. when the so coupling is dominated by the dresselhaus term in a macroscopically symmetrical semiconductor structure with significant bulk inversion asymmetry ( bia ) and negligible structure inversion asymmetry ( sia ) .",
    "one can see from fig.[fratio ] that the only significant component of spin texture in this limit is @xmath88 although it is always several times smaller in amplitude than the maximum achievable @xmath86 and @xmath87 components at various @xmath6 .",
    "this local component of field - induced spin texture can be non - zero since the structure has a microscopic bia and is non - homogeneous due to the presence of the superlattice .",
    "nevertheless , the mean value of the out - of - plane component @xmath88 is zero for all values of @xmath6 and @xmath46 , i.e. the condition ( [ szero ] ) is always fulfilled , as it can be checked numerically for the textures in fig.[frd](c ) and fig.[fratio](c ) .",
    "another important issue is the symmetry properties of the induced polarization .",
    "the presence of purely dresselhaus so coupling brakes the bulk inversion symmetry , i.e. the @xmath99 element of symmetry is no longer present . for the induced spin texture considered here",
    "the only component of spin is @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath100 . despite the existence of the @xmath101 rotation axis parallel to the @xmath34 direction , the application of this rotation to the particular orientation of the induced spin @xmath102 is equivalent to the inversion @xmath99 which is no longer present as a symmetry element due to the dresselhaus so coupling . as for the pure rashba coupling",
    ", the same effect is produced by the breaking of the @xmath103 symmetry by the sia with the confinement potential @xmath104 .",
    "hence , the existence of the electric field - induced @xmath33 spin component here is consistent with the symmetry relations .",
    "it should be mentioned also that the existence of the out - of - plane spin polarization induced by the in - plane electric field in a system with both rashba and dresselhaus so coupling is a well - known phenomenon in the context of the spin hall effect where the uniformly spaced spin currents of @xmath33 components have been predicted.@xcite    we now consider the general case of non - zero rashba and dresselhaus so terms . as we move along the @xmath6 axis",
    ", it becomes clear that the maximum amplitudes for @xmath86 and @xmath87 components are achieved when rashba and dresselhaus terms become comparable in size while the shape of @xmath88 is only slightly modified .",
    "the @xmath86 and @xmath87 components both have a non - zero mean value which is in the agreement of the calculated spin projections in fig.[fjs ] and is important in the scope of the practical issues of spin accumulation .",
    "the presence of both rashba and dresselhaus terms leads to the appearance of two non - zero components of the accumulated spin instead of one ( @xmath90 only ) when the so coupling is purely of rashba type.@xcite it should be noted that a high degree of spin polarization at equal strengths of rashba and dresselhaus terms is in the agreement with the results of numerous studies of transport and spin hall phenomena in such systems .",
    "hence , the example of @xmath80 for inas - based structure which was studied above in details is promising since the desirable spin properties in such system are manifested on the highest achievable level .",
    "finally , let us consider the limit @xmath105 when the rashba term dominates over the dresselhaus term , although the latter is reported still to be non - zero in practically used structures,@xcite and thus the symmetry of the system on the whole @xmath6 axis remains to be the same ( except for one point @xmath106 ) . here",
    "one can observe a non - zero integral over @xmath87 only which is consistent with previous results on the @xmath90 component of spin accumulation in a system with pure rashba so coupling.@xcite the @xmath86 component tends to vanish while the @xmath88 component has qualitatively the same form on the whole @xmath6 axis and zero mean value .",
    "we see that the shape and the amplitude of @xmath88 are only weakly dependent on the specific value of @xmath6 , as it has been discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "one can see a change of the @xmath88 shape occurring at the transmission trough the point @xmath107 where the function @xmath88 almost vanishes which is in agreement with topological properties of the spin structure .",
    "however , the major part of experimentally studied nanostructures with so coupling are characterized by some intermediate ratio @xmath6 which is far away from any of the special value.@xcite we believe that further theoretical and experimental studies of gated spin - orbit structures are promising since the strength of rashba term can be widely tuned by the gate voltage,@xcite and the generation of spin textures presented in figures [ frd ] and [ fratio ] with different ratios @xmath6 including the special ones seems to be experimentally accessible .",
    "we have studied the dc charge current , the spin polarization , and the spin textures in the 1d gated superlattice with both fixed and varying rashba and dresselhaus so coupling terms and the spectrum consisting of multiple pairs of spin - split minibands .",
    "we have seen how the presence of both dresselhaus and rashba terms with varying ratio is reflected in the so - sensitive spin properties of the electron gas for both mean spin values and spin textures .",
    "it was found that the spin component with zero mean value can have non - vanishing field - induced spin texture in a superlattice cell which can be probed experimentally .",
    "it is shown that the consideration of the finite parameters for collision rate and temperature is non - destructive for the calculated current and spin characteristics depending on all states below the fermi level .",
    "the knowledge of field - induced spin textures in addition to the spin polarization and charge current may be instructive for both fundamental and applied issues of low - dimensional semiconductor structures with strong so coupling .",
