    "mathematical modelling of hydraulically - driven fractures is a highly demanded subject in modern technologies for enhancement of reservoir permeability in hydrocarbon production as well as in geophysical problems related , for instance , to the development of magmatic dykes .",
    "recent progress in the modelling of hydraulic fracture dynamics is described in the review papers @xcite and citations therein .",
    "the early although widely used models by khristianovich , zheltov , geertsma , and de klerk ( kgd ) @xcite and by perkins , kern and nordgen ( pkn ) @xcite assume that the fracture is propagating in infinite elastic medium and the fluid exchange between the fracture and the porous reservoir is modelled as only a fracturing fluid loss ( leakoff ) according to carter s formula @xcite which proposes that the leakoff is inverse proportional to the square root of the wetting time .",
    "more advanced models of the leakoff suppose computation of the pore pressure around the fracture by solving the piezoconduction equation @xcite although still do not considering the influence of the pore fluid to stresses .",
    "theoretical study of the action of the pore pressure to the distribution of stresses near the fracture was carried out in many papers , a detailed review can be found in the introduction of the dissertation by y. yuan @xcite . in particular , the additional stiffness of the rock due to the pressure in the vicinity of the fracture was treated as the backstress @xcite .",
    "it was noted , that the wellbore fluid pressure needed to open the fracture considerably rises due to the backstress .",
    "the same effect leads to the overestimation of the minifrac tests for the _ in situ _ minimal principal stress @xcite .",
    "the mentioned facts indicate that proper account for the action of the pore pressure and proper modelling of the fluid exchange between the fracture and the porous reservoir is principal for the correct description of the fracture dynamics .    in our paper",
    "we propose a mathematical model for propagation of a hydraulic fracture in a poroelastic medium .",
    "the numerical solution of the problem is carried out by the finite element method with the use of a modification of the algorithm suggested in @xcite .",
    "we use an approach of modelling free of explicit tracking of the fracture s tip similar to the one used in @xcite .",
    "the advantage of our model is that we do not need to rebuild the computational mesh according to propagation of the fracture , which is typical for problems of this type .",
    "the rock failure criteria is modelled using the cohesive zone model initially proposed by barenblatt @xcite and dugdale @xcite .",
    "this model allows us to eliminate the stress singularity at the fracture s tip as well as to integrate the computation of the failure criteria into the numerical algorithm .",
    "the correctness of the model is checked by the analysis of the numerical convergence of the algorithm and by comparison with analytic and numerical solutions presented in @xcite . in all observed cases",
    "we have a satisfactory coincidence of the solutions .",
    "the constructed model is used for the analysis of the influence of the pore pressure to the fracture dynamics .",
    "we demonstrate that the dynamics is governed by the two factors : the rate of the medium displacement that modifies the filtration , and by the backstress that significantly increases the pressure inside the fracture . for the relatively high rock permeability these two factors notably increase the leakoff and hence , decrease the length of the fracture .",
    "the demonstrated effect is dumped by high reservoir s storage coefficient or low rock permeability .",
    "let us consider a vertical planar fracture of fixed height @xmath0 , propagating along the straight line denoted as @xmath1-axis ( see figure  [ fig : frac_geometry_3d ] ) .",
    "we direct @xmath2-axis upwards and @xmath3-axis perpendicular to the plane of the fracture propagation .",
    "we suppose that fracture s aperture is constant along the vertical coordinate @xmath2 , so the plain strain approximation is applicable .",
    "this implies , that we can limit ourselves to observing only the central cross - section @xmath4 of the fracture .",
    "the poroelastic medium is characterized by its porosity @xmath5 and permeability @xmath6 , with the solid phase displacement @xmath7 , and the pore pressure @xmath8 .",
    "pores are saturated by a single - phase newtonian fluid with the effective viscosity @xmath9 .",
    "we make use of the linear darcy law for the fluid velocity @xmath10 .",
    "it is supposed that the fluid filtrating from the fracture to the reservoir has the same viscosity as the pore fluid",
    ". however , the fluid within the fracture has different viscosity @xmath11 .",
    "this corresponds to the normal situation in hydraulic fracturing when the fracturing fluid is a high - viscous gel and only its low - viscous base fluid is filtrated into the reservoir .    for the generality ,",
    "the reservoir is initially subjected to a prestress with the stress tensor @xmath12 .",
    "since we observe only straight fractures , tensor @xmath13 satisfies symmetry conditions relative to @xmath1-axis .",
    "the governing equations of the quasi - static poroelasticity model are the following @xcite : @xmath14              \\displaystyle s_\\varepsilon {      \\dfrac{\\partial p}{\\partial t } } = \\operatorname{div}{\\bigl ( \\frac{k_r}{\\eta_r}\\nabla p - \\alpha {      \\dfrac{\\partial { \\mathbf{u}}}{\\partial t } } \\bigr)}.          \\end{array}\\ ] ] here @xmath15 is the cauchy s strain tensor @xmath16 @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the biot coefficient , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are elasticity moduli , @xmath21 is the identity tensor .",
    "the storativity @xmath22 reflects the dependence of the lagrangian porosity @xmath5 on @xmath23 and @xmath24 as in  @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the bulk modulus , @xmath27 is the initial porosity . due to the plane strain approximation ,",
    "the solid phase displacement vector @xmath28 is two - dimensional , all vector operations are also taken in 2d space of independent variables @xmath29 .",
    "symmetry of the problem with respect to @xmath30-axis allows solving equations in domain @xmath31 as shown in figure [ fig : fracture_geometry_2d ] .    ]    ]    over the outer boundary @xmath32 the confining far - field stress @xmath33 is applied and the constant pore pressure @xmath34 is prescribed : @xmath35    henceforth @xmath36 and @xmath37 denotes the outer normal and tangential unit vectors to the boundary of the domain @xmath38 ; the summation over the repeating indices is implied .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the minimal principal _ in situ _ stress .",
    "moreover , we assume that the prestress @xmath13 satisfy the same boundary condition : @xmath41 .    in order to close the model it is supplemented with the initial data at some moment @xmath42 : @xmath43      the line @xmath44 is divided into the part @xmath45 occupied by the fracture , and the remaining part @xmath46 . outside the fracture on @xmath47",
    "the symmetry conditions ( see  @xcite ) are satisfied : @xmath48    with @xmath49 standing for the fluid pressure inside the fracture and @xmath50 denoting the cohesive forces near the fracture s tips ( explained below ) , the force balance over the fracture s wall yields @xmath51 here we neglect the tangential stress due to the fluid friction on the fracture s walls in comparison with the normal stress .",
    "the fluid flow in the fracture is governed by the mass conservation law complemented with the poiseuille formula : @xmath52 here @xmath53 is a half of the fracture aperture , @xmath54 is the fluid velocity in @xmath1-direction .",
    "no fluid lag is assumed at the fracture s tip .",
    "the leakoff velocity @xmath55 is given by the darcy law as @xmath56    the resulting equation governing the flow inside the fracture reads @xmath57    the flow rate ( per unit height ) injected into the fracture upper half - plane is calculated as @xmath58 where the division by 2 shows that the total flow rate is equally distributed between the symmetric fracture parts , and @xmath59 denotes the volumetric flow rate injected into the well .    equation is often referred to as the lubrication theory equation  @xcite .",
    "note that , due to the right - hand side of , equation represents a boundary condition for equations of the main model .",
    "the leakoff rate @xmath55 arises here naturally in the course of the problem s solution , which differentiates the model favourably from the usual artificial approximations like carter s formula or other similar expressions  @xcite .      in order to account for the rock toughness during the fracturing",
    ", we adopt the cohesive zone model initially proposed by barenblatt @xcite and dugdale @xcite . in this approach",
    "it is postulated the existence of cohesive forces @xmath50 ( see figure [ fig : cohesive_zone_sketch ] ) acting in the zone of micro - cracking and plastic deformations in the vicinity of the fracture s tip .",
    "the cohesive forces slow down the fracture opening process at the initial stage of the rock failure . on the computational side ,",
    "presence of the cohesive forces removes the stress singularity at the fracture s tip inherent to the linear elastic fracture mechanics ( lefm ) by making the fracture aperture smoothly vanishing towards the tip .",
    "we use the following traction / separation bi - linear law @xcite to reflect the dependence of @xmath50 on the fracture aperture @xmath60 as shown in figure [ fig : cohesive_law ] : @xmath61 \\sigma_c\\bigl(\\dfrac{w_c - w}{w_c - w_m}\\bigr ) , & w_m\\leqslant w \\leqslant w_c,\\\\[2ex ] 0 , & w \\geqslant w_c.\\\\[2ex ] \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]            the cohesive forces reach their maximum value @xmath62 near the fracture s tip as the fracture s aperture is equal to @xmath63 . the region of the micro - cracking is limited by maximal fracture s aperture @xmath64 .",
    "the value of @xmath64 is calculated from the considerations that the energy released during the creation of the new fracture surface is equal to the work of the cohesive forces on the fracture opening .",
    "hence , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the fracture energy in the griffiths s theory of brittle fractures @xcite .",
    "the elastic region of cohesive forces is small , @xmath67 .",
    "it is required to regularize the cohesive energy near @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "if the cohesive zone is small relative to the fracture s length , the connection with the fracture toughness @xmath69 from lefm is given by irvin s formula @xcite : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the young s modulus and @xmath72 is the poisson s ratio .",
    "for computational reasons , it is convenient to homogenise the conditions over the outer boundary @xmath73",
    ". it can be done by considering the stresses inside the reservoir relative to the prestress state @xmath13 , and taking @xmath74 as a reference pressure .",
    "for the boundary conditions defined in section [ reservoireqs ] the initial deformation @xmath75 due to the prestress has the form @xmath76 at that , @xmath77 similar to @xcite , the following new sought functions are introduced : @xmath78 substituting into equations and taking into account boundary conditions , , , , , we obtain the following problem    : & = -^0 , = + 2 e()- , & [ eq : tild_formul_equilib ] + : & s _",

    "it can be seen that the fracture is slightly shorter in the uncoupled case d. as it follows from the filtration equation , for zero storage coefficient @xmath179 the flow rate of fluid through every closed surface is proportional to the negative rate of the surface deformation .",
    "this implies , that the rock deformation generates the fluid filtration in the direction opposite to the time derivative of the displacement vector .",
    "this effect is dumped by the non - zero material storativity @xmath180 .    in application to the cases",
    "c and d in figure  [ fig : pressureandwidthprofilealphazerononzerohipermlosetimestep200 ] , this implies that in case c deformation of rock in the direction perpendicular to the fracture s wall generate the backflow of fluid towards the fracture , that reduces the overall fluid leakoff and , consequently , increases the volume of the obtained fracture .",
    "the observations above can be summed up in the first thumb rule : `` deformation causes counter filtration '' .",

    "the rock deformation does not change the fluid filtration .",
    "however , in the partially uncoupled case b the pore fluid creates an additional hydrostatic compression of rock that compensates a part of the pressure of fracturing fluid to fracture s walls .",
    "this effect is referred to as the backstress @xcite .",
    "the backstress effectively reduces the pressure applied to fracture s walls by the fracturing fluid . in turn , this causes the increase of fluid pressure inside the fracture in order to maintain the fracture opening required to accommodate the given fluid inflow at the wellbore .",
    "this observation is supported by the comparison of graphs of pressure for cases b and d in figure  [ fig : pressureandwidthprofilealphazerononzerohipermlosetimestep200 ] .",
    "the increase of the pressure inside the fracture leads to the higher fluid loss due to the filtration through fracture s walls , which in turn reduces the effectiveness of fluid and decreases the fracture size ( compare graphs for fracture half - width in figure  [ fig : pressureandwidthprofilealphazerononzerohipermlosetimestep200 ] ) .",
    "the second thumb rule for the action of the pore fluid to the rock deformation is thus `` the pore pressure stiffens the rock '' .      in the fully coupled case",
    "the fracture propagation is governed by the interplay of the two factors : influence of the rock deformation to the fluid filtration and action of the backstress that rises the pressure of fracturing fluid and increases the leakoff . as it can be seen by comparison of graphs a ) @xmath169 , @xmath177 and d ) @xmath178 in figure  [ fig : pressureandwidthprofilealphazerononzerohipermlosetimestep200 ] , the fracture is about 20% wider and longer for the uncoupled case d than in the fully coupled case a.    the reason for the decrease of fracture s volume is twofold .",
    "first , in the coupled case the fluid pressure within the fracture is higher due to the backstress ( the second thumb rule ) , hence , the leakoff rate is higher as well and the fracture volume is lower .",
    "however , this factor alone can not explain the significant difference in the fracture geometry as it follows from the comparison of cases b and d in the previous section .",
    "the second factor is the action of the rock deformation to the filtration .",
    "one could expect that , according to the first thumb rule , the leakoff of fluid from the fracture to the reservoir would be reduced due to the rock displacement as it happened in case c ( see section [ firstthumbrule ] ) .",
    "this effect is really taken place , although not in the fracture direction but towards the area of the maximal rate of rock displacement . indeed , the pore pressure produces an additional stiffness of the rock near the fracture ( the second thumb rule ) that decreases along @xmath3 coordinate .",
    "therefore , the maximum value of the displacement is reached not on the fracture s wall , but at some distance from the fracture .",
    "this effect is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : v3d11and00alphahipermlosetimestep200 ] where we compare the vertical displacement @xmath99 for cases of fully coupled case a ( left ) and uncoupled case d ( right ) . according to the first thumb rule , fluid is attracted to the area of the highest rate of rock displacement , which is located at some distance from the fracture , and causes an extra leakoff from the fracture .     of the displacement in ( a )",
