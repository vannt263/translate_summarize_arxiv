    "as the most common stellar remnants , white dwarfs ( wd ) provide an invaluable tracer of the early evolution of the galaxy .",
    "their current density and distribution reflects the disposition of their progenitor main sequence stars and their colors indicate their ages , which are consistent with many of them having been formed when the galaxy was quite young ( e.g. wood 1992 ) .    until recently , it has been assumed that halo wds contribute a negligible fraction of the total mass of the galaxy ( e.g. gould , flynn & bahcall 1998 ) .",
    "this view is supported by the constraint that the formation of @xmath210.6m@xmath15 wds is accompanied by the release of several solar masses of gas , heavily enriched in cno elements ( e.g. charlot & silk 1995 ; gibson & mould 1997 ; canal , isern & ruiz - lapuente 1997 ) . yet",
    "local stars and interstellar gas , which only comprise @xmath25% of the total galaxy mass , contain only 23 percent of these elements by mass . based on these metalicity arguments , most recently fields , freese & graff ( 2000 )",
    "have argued that @xmath26@xmath27@xmath28 from c and n element abundances , adopting h@xmath29=70kms@xmath5mpc@xmath5 .",
    "wds can therefore not comprise more than 110% percent of the dark matter in the galactic halo within 50  kpc , if @xmath30 ( e.g. bahcall et al . 2000 ) .",
    "however , this argument can be circumvented if significant metal outflow from the galaxy , due to supernovae , accompanies the formation of these wds , thereby removing most of the produced metals from the galaxy ( e.g. fields , mathews & schramm 1997 ) .",
    "these considerations are important because the macho collaboration ( e.g. alcock et al . 2000 ) report a frequency of large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) microlensing events that is suggestive of 850% ( 95% c.l ) of the halo mass in @xmath31m@xmath15 compact objects inside a 50  kpc galacto - centric radius .",
    "faint stars and brown dwarfs seem to comprise only a few percent of the galaxy mass ( e.g. bahcall et al .",
    "1994 ; graff & freese 1996a , 1996b ; mera , chabrier & schaeffer 1996 ; flynn , gould & bahcall 1996 ; freese , fields & graff 1998 ) and are therefore unlikely to be responsible for these microlensing events .",
    "the only remaining candidates with similar masses , known to us , are wds .",
    "alternative explanations for these microlensing events , based on stellar self - lensing in the lmc have been put forward ( wu 1994 ; sahu 1994 ; salati et al . 1999 ; aubourg et al .",
    "1999 ; evans & kerins 2000 ) .",
    "a comparable microlensing survey done by the eros collaboration only claims an upper limit of 40% ( 95% c.l . ) of the halo mass in compact objects with mass less than 1  m@xmath15 ( lasserre et al . 2000 ; see afonso et al .",
    "1999 for smc results ) .",
    "because the eros survey targets the outer regions of the lmc , in contrast to the macho survey , this could indeed suggest some self - lensing contribution .",
    "there have also been claims of a number of high proper - motion objects in the hdf , which were suggested to be old wds in the galactic halo at a distance of @xmath212  kpc ( ibata et al .",
    "1999 ) , with blue colors that were consistent with revised white - dwarf atmosphere models ( hansen 1999 ) .",
    "more locally , ibata et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found two high proper - motion wds . if the hdf results had been confirmed , they alone would have been sufficient to explain the observed microlensing optical depth towards the lmc .",
    "however , recent third - epoch observations have shown that these `` objects '' were misidentifications and _ not _ moving objects ( richer 2001 ) .",
    "the topic has become interesting again , though , with the recent discovery by oppenheimer et al ( 2001 ) of 38 nearby , old wds , with de - projected horizontal velocities in excess of 94  kms@xmath5  ( see sect.2 ) .",
    "they concluded that at least two percent of the halo is composed of these cool wds .",
    "this conclusion has been challenged , however , by reid , sahu & hawley ( 2001 ) , who claim that these wds could be the high - velocity tail of the thick disk .",
    "in addition , hansen ( 2001 ) has argued that these wds follow the same color - magnitude relation as those of the disc , which might be unexpected if they are a halo population .    in this paper , we take the observations of oppenheimer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) at face value and examine their conclusions in more detail .",
    "we assume that the high proper motion objects have correctly been identified as wds and that their inferred distances are statistically unbiased . however , it is important that additional observations be performed to validate this .",
    "we also discuss how to set more precise bounds on the halo wd density .",
    "the high proper motion wds were selected from digitized photographic plates from the supercosmos sky survey ( hambly et al .",
    "2001 ) , covering an effectively searched area of 4165 square degree around the south galactic pole ( sgp ) , upto @xmath32@xmath33@xmath3445@xmath35 . objects with proper motions between @xmath36=0.33 and 10.0  arcsec  yr@xmath5  were selected , that were brighter than @xmath37=19.8 mag and seen at three epochs in each field . from these objects a sample of 126 potential halo wds",
    "was drawn based on their reduced proper motion ( @xmath38=@xmath37 + 5@xmath39 + 5 ) and their color @xmath40 .",
    "after spectroscopic observations of 69 of the 92 wds without spectra ( 34 had published spectra ) , a sample of 99 wds remained . for a full discusion of the sample , its selection criteria and completeness",
    ", we refer to oppenheimer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "distances to each of these wds were ascribed using the photometric parallax relation derived by bergeron et al .",
    "this was checked in two cases using measured distances and the relative uncertainty was estimated at 20  percent . using these distances , oppenheimer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) subsequently performed a velocity selection on the wd sample .",
    "the proper motions were converted into a velocity in galactic coordinates relative to the local standard of rest , ( lsr ) , with @xmath41 directed towards the galactic center ( gc ) , @xmath42 along the direction of the circular velocity and @xmath43 towards the north galactic pole ( ngp ) , see fig.2 .",
    "the absence of a measured radial velocity ( @xmath44 ) was compensated by assuming that @xmath43=0 and deprojecting onto the @xmath45 plane .",
    "it was then argued that 95  percent for a 2d rayleigh distribution .",
    "] of the thick - disc wds have velocities in the plane within 94  km s@xmath5 ( @xmath46 ) from the asymmetric drift point @xmath47=@xmath48 and consequently all such wds were eliminated , leaving a sample of 38 high - velocity wds of which 26 are new discoveries and 14 exhibit hydrogen lines and are believed to be younger .",
    "these wds have velocities in the galactic plane that are enclosed within a circle of radius @xmath49 centered on @xmath50  km s@xmath5 corresponding to a non - rotating halo distribution .",
    "the density of wds in the magnitude - limited sample was then estimated to be @xmath51  m@xmath15  pc@xmath10 , roughly ten times the expected density ( e.g. gould , flynn & bahcall 1998 ) and equivalent to 2  percent of the nominal local halo mass density ( e.g. gates , gyuk & turner 1995 ) .",
    "this procedure has been criticised by reid , sahu & hawley ( 2001 ) who de - project the velocity vector by setting the radial velocity ( @xmath44 ) to zero , thereby reducing the number of high velocity wds .",
    "this procedure , however , also places several lower velocity wds outside the 94  km s@xmath5 cut .",
    "reid et al . ( 2001 ) also note that the high velocity wds are not concentrated around @xmath50  km s@xmath5 as might be expected from a halo population and argue that the wds are mostly associated with the high velocity tail of the thick disc plus a few wds from the traditional halo stellar population .",
    "essentially the same point has been made by graff ( 2001 ) .",
    "in addition , gibson & flynn ( 2001 ) identified a number of errors in the original table of white - dwarf properties and argued that the oppenheimer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) densities are further overestimated by a factor 310 , bringing them more into line with the results from other surveys .    in this paper , we analyse the full sample of 99 wds , not only those 38 with the highest space velocities , thereby avoiding potential pitfalls associated with arbitrary cuts in the sample and analysing only subsamples .",
    "the photometric parallax method to obtain distances hides a potential problem for the oldest wds ( @xmath5210  gyr ) .",
    "although these white dwarfs continue to cool and fade away , their @xmath53 color remains nearly constant at @xmath331.9 for @xmath54@xmath5218 ( fig.1 ; e.g. chabrier et al .",
    "2000 ) . blindly applying the linear color - magnitude relation given in oppenheimer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to the oldest wds would therefore lead to a severe overestimate of their intrinsic luminosity and distance . even if old wds are present in the sample , it might not be surprising that they do nt show up in the color - magnitude relation by hansen ( 2001 ) .",
    "wds that move onto the horizontal branch of the cooling curve have increasingly overestimated luminositities and consequently move up in the color - magnitude diagram much closer to the sequence of younger ( @xmath5510 gyr ) wds .",
    "fortunately , only 5% of the sample of wds have colors  @xmath56@xmath521.8  ( fig.1 ) and it should therefore not create a major problem .    however , it is potentially dangerous to create color - magnitude diagrams , using distances that have been derived by forcing the wds to follow the color - magnitude relation of relatively young wds , and from those to conclude that the wd are young .",
    "this is a circular argument .",
    "a better argument is to plot the age sequence on a two - color diagram ( fig.1 ; see also oppenheimer et al .",
    "again , there is no evidence for wds older than @xmath25  gyr and the high - velocity wds appear to be drawn from the same population as the low - velocity wds which are presumably relics of ongoing star formation in the disc .",
    "this appears to argue against there being a substantial white - dwarf halo population ( e.g. hansen 2001 ) , although if there exists a mechanism that preferentially gives wds a high space - velocity during its formation / evolution one might not expect a correlation between age and velocity .",
    "the latter would only be expected if velocities increased with time due to slower scattering processes .",
    "we return to this in sect.7 .",
    "we should emphasize , however , that the implied ages and distances are only as good as the assumed underlying white - dwarf color - magnitude relation , in this case that from bergeron et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and that independent measurements of their distances are necessary , preferentially through parallax measurements , even though that will be difficult given their large proper motions .",
    "for each wd , we transform its equatorial coordinates ( @xmath57,@xmath58 ) in to galactic coordinates ( @xmath59,@xmath32)=122.932@xmath35 for the galactic longitude of the celestial pole . ] . using the distances ascribed by oppenheimer et al .",
    "2001 , we then transform the observed proper motion vector in galactic coordinates into a vector @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is velocity component along the @xmath59-direction and @xmath62 is the velocity component along the the @xmath32-direction ( fig.2 ) .",
    "the resulting vector is orthogonal to the line - of - sight , i.e. the direction of the radial velocity ( @xmath44 ) , which is unknown to us .",
    "the transformation from the observed velocities to galactic velocities ( @xmath41,@xmath42,@xmath43 ) with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) , is @xmath63 where @xmath64  km s@xmath5 is the solar motion with respect to the lsr ( dehen & binney 1998b ) .",
    "we can use eq.([coordtrans ] ) to transform the velocity distribution function @xmath65 (  4.6 ) in to @xmath66 , or visa versa , at the position of any wd with a measured proper - motion vector and distance .",
    "fig.3 shows velocity vector ( @xmath61,@xmath62 ) for each wd at its corresponding galactic coordinates .",
    "the velocity vectors point preferentially in the direction opposite to galactic rotation , which reflects the asymmetric drift (  4.2 ) , whereby a stellar population that is significantly pressure supported , rotates slower than its lsr .",
    "if many of the high proper motion objects had been misidentied on the photometric plates , one does not expect a collective movement of these objects in the same direction .",
    "before introducing a model for the phase - space density of wds in the solar neighborhood in  4.6 , we first ( i ) describe a simple global potential model that we will employ to derive some of the characteristic orbital parameters of the sample of wds , ( ii ) reprise epicyclic theory , in order to clarify the discussion and some of the concepts that we will use in this paper , ( iii ) derive some characteristic quantities of the white - dwarfs data set , ( iv ) examine the properties of the white - dwarf orbits and ( v ) discuss some general properties of the galactic disc components .      for definiteness",
    "we assume a spherically symmetric potential for the galaxy @xmath67 in cylindrical coordinates , where @xmath68 is the distance from the rotation axis of the galaxy and @xmath69 is the height above the plane .",
    "the simplification of spherical symmetry is not inconsistent with observations of the galaxy and external galaxies , even though a wide range of values for the flattening of the galactic halo is allowed , often strongly dependent on the method used to derive it ( see olling & merrifield 2000 ) .",
    "this potential , although a clear simplification , it is to first order also consistent with the relatively flat galactic rotation curve ( e.g. dehnen & binney 1998a ) and allows us to gain insight in the kinematics and properties of the white - dwarf sample .",
    "the circular velocity @xmath70=@xmath71 in this potential is constant in the plane of the galaxy ( @xmath69=0 ) .",
    "one can subsequently introduce the effective potential @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the angular momentum of a wd and @xmath74 is its tangential velocity in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "if a particle is `` at rest '' in the minimum of the effective potential , i.e. @xmath75=0 , one readily finds that @xmath74=@xmath70 , hence the wd moves on a circular orbit with a constant velocity @xmath70=@xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the angular velocity .",
    "most stars and stellar remnants , however , do not move on perfect circular orbits , but have an additional random velocity and move on orbits around the minimum in their effective potential .",
    "if these excursions have relatively small amplitudes , the taylor expansion of the effective potential around this minimum can be terminated at the second - order derivative and the stars or wds will exhibit sinusoidal ( i.e. epicyclic ) motions around the circular orbit",
    ". the frequency of these epicyclic motions are @xmath78 in the tangential and radial directions and @xmath79 in the direction out of the plane .",
    "the radius of the guiding centre is @xmath80 ( see  4.2 ) .",
    "because these frequencies depend on local higher - order derivatives of the potential , we can not use our simple potential model , eqn.([eq : potentialeff ] ) , but have to rely on observational constraints  (  4.2 ) .",
    "one can introduce the oort s constants @xmath81 and @xmath82 , whose values have observationally been determined to be @xmath81=14.5kms@xmath5kpc@xmath5 and @xmath82=@xmath3412kms@xmath5kpc@xmath5 in the solar neighborhood . ]",
    "( bt87 ) . from this",
    "is follows that @xmath83 , i.e. @xmath84kms@xmath5kpc@xmath5 , and @xmath85 the frequency of the epicyclic motion is therefore constant at 1.3 times its orbital frequency , irrespective of the amplitude of the orbit around the minimum of its effective potential . in comparison ,",
    "the potential given by eq.([eq : potential ] ) gives @xmath86 .    under the epicyclic approximation , stars undergo retrograde , elliptical , orbits in the plane about their guiding centers , which move on circular orbits .",
    "the ratio of the radial velocity amplitude to the azimuthal velocity amplitude is @xmath87 , where @xmath88  km s@xmath5  kpc@xmath5 is the circular angular frequency ( e.g. bt87 ) and @xmath89 is given above .",
    "the individual orbits are elongated azimuthally",
    ". however , at a given point , retrograde motion by stars with interior guiding centers that orbit faster than the lsr , must be combined with prograde motion executed by stars with exterior guiding centers that orbit more slowly .",
    "the net result is that the ratio of the radial velocity dispersion to the azimuthal velocity dispersion is predicted to be @xmath90=@xmath91@xmath331.5 .",
    "this prediction is supported by observations of different stellar populations ( e.g. dehnen & binney 1998b ; dehen 1998 ; chiba & beers 2000 ) .",
    "superimposed on this horizontal motion is a vertical oscillation with angular frequency , @xmath92 , which is uncoupled to the horizontal motion at this level of approximation .",
    "the amplitude of this oscillation is determined by the past history including scattering off molecular clouds and spiral arms , and is measured to be approximately @xmath93@xmath330.5 ( e.g. dehnen & binney 1998b ; dehen 1998 ; chiba & beers 2000 ) .",
    "the velocity ellipsoid appears to maintain these dispersion ratios even for velocities where the epicyclic approximation ought to be quite inaccurate .    at the next level of approximation",
    ", we must include the radial density variation and this will contribute a mean tangential velocity , relative to the lsr , at a point , as there are more stars with interior guiding centers moving backwards than exterior stars moving forwards .",
    "this is the asymmetric drift , @xmath94=@xmath95@xmath42@xmath96=@xmath97 , which is the velocity lag of a population of stars with respect to the lsr .",
    "this can be estimated from the fluid ( jeans ) equations by observing that the circular velocity of a group of stars will be reduced by a quantity proportional to the pressure gradient per unit density .",
    "this should scale @xmath98 and it is found ( dehen & binney 1998b ) that @xmath99 roughly consistent with a calculation using the disc density variation . later in the paper (  5.1 )",
    ", we use this expression as a self - consistency check of our results .",
    "in addition , moving groups or non - axisymmetric density variations ( e.g. spiral structure ) could be responsible for a second effect , a rotation of the velocity ellipsoid in the horizontal plane , known as vertex deviation .",
    "this effect is quite small for old stars ( i.e. @xmath5510@xmath35 ; dehen & binney 1998b ) and we shall therefore ignore it .",
    "we notice here a key simplification that follows from the realization that we can observe stars moving with relative azimuthal sky velocity @xmath100 out to a distance @xmath101 .",
    "by contrast , the amplitude of the radial excursion is @xmath21@xmath102 .",
    "we can therefore ignore curvature of the stellar orbits and spatial gradients in the stellar density over the sample volume .",
    "a corollary is that we can also ignore a small rotational correction when relating the proper motion to the space velocity .",
    "there is a standard procedure for finding the mean velocity of a sample of stars with known proper motions and distances , even when their distribution on the sky is far from isotropic ( bm98 ) .",
    "we define a projection matrix @xmath103 in galactic cartesian coordinates , where @xmath104 is unit vector in the direction of the n - th star .",
    "the velocity that minimises the dispersion about its projection onto the measured tangential velocity @xmath105 is easily shown to be @xmath106_{ij}<p>_j$ ] .",
    "carrying out this operation for the full 99 wd sample gives a mean velocity , essentially the asymmetric drift velocity relative to the lsr , of @xmath107  km s@xmath5 .",
    "this result is fairly robust in the sense that it is not seriously changed if we remove a few very high velocities whose reality could be suspect .",
    "the sample has no significant motion either radially or perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy , but clearly shows the asymmetric drift in @xmath42 .",
    "such an asymmetric drift , according to eqn.([eq : asymdrift ] ) , would naively imply a velocity dispersion for the complete sample of @xmath108kms@xmath5 .",
    "the absence of a velocity drift in the @xmath41 and @xmath43 directions also supports the notion that this wd population is near equilibrium .",
    "the values of the velocity dispersion and asymmetric drift of a kinematically unbiased sample , however , will be lower than found above , because a proper - motion limited sample will preferentially bias toward the high - velocity wds ( see sect.5 ) .      because wds can move distances from the sun that are at least @xmath212 orders of magnitude larger than their observed distances (  4.2 ) , the majority originate far from the lsr . to quantify this",
    ", we have calculated the inner and outermost radii ( @xmath109 and @xmath110 ) of the white - dwarf orbits in the simplified galactic potential , eqn.([eq : potential ] ) , using the velocities @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and explicitly assuming @xmath43=0 ( i.e. the wds move only in the galactic plane ) .",
    "the assumption @xmath43=0 leads to a tight scatter of the wds around the relation @xmath111 , whereas the assumption @xmath44=0 leads to results are similar within a few percent .",
    "statistically , these two different assumptions are therefore expected to lead to only minor differences .",
    "the results , shown in fig .  4 , indicate that as many as 98 , 72 , 29 and 14 of the 99 wds make excursions more than 1 , 3 , 5 and 7  kpc , respectively .",
    "none of the wds have both the inner and outermost radii inside the volume probed by the most distant observed wd ( at @xmath21150pc ) . hence , even under the restrictive assumption that these wds do not move out of the galactic plane , the majority are not of local origin , but come from a volume at is at least 3 to 4 orders of magnitude larger than that probed by the survey .",
    "to illustrate this more graphically , we have plotted the orbits of two white dwarfs in the sample in fig .  5 , assuming firstly that the wds lies in a thin , equatorial disk , i.e. @xmath112 , and secondly that they are drawn from the bi - maxwellian velocity distribution discussed below (  4.6 ) .",
    "one wd has a high velocity and moves on a nearly radial orbit , the other moves on a nearly circular orbit .",
    "it is clear that the epicyclic approximation is unlikely to provide an accurate description for the orbits of most high velocity wds .      in general the disc of our galaxy",
    "is thought to be composed of two major dynamically distrinct components ; the thin disc and a thick stellar disc , which supposedly comprises several percent of the stellar disc mass ( e.g. gilmore & reid 1983 ; gilmore , wyse , & kuijken 1989 ) .    whereas the thin disc has a relatively low velocity dispersion of @xmath113@xmath2120  kms@xmath5  in the vertical direction and is only several hundred pc thick , the thick disc has velocity dispersion that is @xmath113@xmath2145  kms@xmath5  and has an asymmetric drift of @xmath94@xmath2140  kms@xmath5(e.g .",
    "gilmore et al .",
    "1989 ; chiba & beers 2000 ) . if discs are treated as massive self - gravitating slabs , such that @xmath114 , thick - disc stars typically move @xmath115@xmath211  kpc out of the plane for the appropriate galactic disc surface densities @xmath116 , consistent with observations ( e.g. reid & majewski 1993 ; robins et al . 1996 ; ojha 2001 ) .    maybe surprisingly",
    ", recently analyzed observations suggest ( i ) that wds which kinematically appear to belong to the thin disc , have a scale height that might be twice that of the traditional thin disc and ( ii ) that the wd sky - density towards to north galactic pole is an order of magnitude higher than found in previous surveys ( majewski & siegel 2001 ) . in comparison , about @xmath2150% of the high proper - motion wds move at least 4  kpc from the lsr (  4.4 ) .",
    "hence , wds with velocities several times the velocity dispersion of the thick disc with respect to the lsr could , in principle , move many kpc out of the galactic plane as well , if their velocity distribution function is not extremely flattened in the vertical direction .",
    "wds observed in the solar neighborhood are therefore a mixed population from the thin disc and the thick disc .",
    "because of the proper - motion cut , we expect only a few wds from the thin disc in the sample .",
    "if the halo contains a significant population of wds , it will also contribute to the local white - dwarf density .",
    "each of these populations have their own kinematic properties , although there could be a continuous transition , for example , from the thick disc to the halo ( e.g. gilmore et al .",
    "1989 ) .",
    "whereas , epicycle theory (  4.2 ) indicates that excursions in the radial and tangential direction are related through conservations of angular momentum , unfortunately , we have little information about the velocities perpendicular to the plane .",
    "however , if most wds are born in the disc , one expects that scattering processes in the plane of the galaxy result in comparable radial , azimuthal and vertical velocities .",
    "this is observationally borne out by the fact that the velocity ellipsoid is isotropic within a factor @xmath212 (  4.2 ) and not extremely flattened .",
    "similarly , if wds occupy the halo as the result of a merger and/or violent relaxation process , during galaxy formation , or if wds are ejected into the halo from the disc ( see  7.2 ) the velocity ellipsoid is also expected to be nearly isotropic",
    ". theoretically nor observationally is there any evidence or indication that a velocity distribution can be extremely flattened in the vertical direction .    if one accepts this conclusion , it is difficult to escape the consequence that the majority of the observed wds with large @xmath41 and @xmath42 velocities also have large @xmath43 velocities and make comparably large vertical excursions .",
    "even , if we conservatively assume that the vertical excursions are only half that in the radial and tangential direction , one finds that @xmath2150% of these ` local ' wds in the sample are expected to move @xmath117  kpc out of the plane , twice the thick disk scale height of @xmath115@xmath211  kpc , although this conclusion could be modified if a proper potential model for the stellar disc and bulge is included ( e.g.  7.2 ) . in the following subsection",
    "we will examine this in more detail , in the context of a local velocity distribution function and show more generally how these results can be translated into a global halo density of wds .",
    "the small sample of wds and lack of radial velocities does not allow us to derive the phase - space density of this population , @xmath118 , where @xmath119 and @xmath120 are position and velocity vectors , respectively ( e.g. bt87 ) .",
    "we must therefore make some simplifying assumptions : ( i ) the phase - space density is locally separable , such that @xmath121 , ( ii ) the velocity distribution function ( vdf ) with respect to an observer at the lsr can be described by a normalized schwarzschild distribution function ( svdf ) @xmath122 where  @xmath120=@xmath123 and ( iii ) @xmath124 is constant in the volume probed by the survey .",
    "the adopted coordinates system is shown in fig.2 .",
    "both the velocity vector ( @xmath41,@xmath42,@xmath43 ) , with respect to an observer at the lsr , and the velocity dispersions @xmath125,@xmath126 and @xmath113  are defined along the principle axes of the galactic coordinate system . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we adopt a bimodal schwarzschild velocity distribution function ( bsvdf ) model @xmath127 where the definitions are as in eqn.([eq : vdf ] ) and @xmath128 is the number - density ratio of wds in the thick disc and halo .",
    "the velocity dispersions , asymmetric drifts and number - density ratio are free parameters .",
    "we emphasize that the adopted bsvdf model is not a unique choice and the real vdf could be a continuous superposition of svdfs or have a form different from maxwellian .",
    "experiments with more general forms of the vdf ( power laws ) , however , give essentially similar results .",

    "this is quite close to the expect value of 0.5 that we suspect that although incompleteness is present , the distribution in @xmath182 parameter space reflects the whole population , where @xmath183 is the luminosity of the wd .",
    "if we ignore possible photometric incompleteness , our estimator of the total space density is @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the fraction of the sky surveyed and @xmath186 is the estimated spectroscopic incompleteness of the 99 wd sample .",

    "this estimator refers to stars whose luminosities and transverse velocities are actually included in the sample although the variance can be quite large if there are significant contributions from wd near the boundaries of this distribution . from fig.1",
    "it is apparent that this range translates into absolute magnitudes , @xmath18919 and ages in the range of about @xmath190  gyr .",
    "the three brightest wds that dominate the density estimate are most likely part of the thin - disc population .",

    "we therefore remove all wds with observed velocities @xmath193  kms@xmath5  from the sample ( three in total ) , which should remove all thin - disc wds .",

    "we therefore do not expect this sample to be significantly incomplete or biased in a way unknown to us .",
    "concluding , the likelihood result that there are two kinematically distinct populations , at the 99% c.l , gives us confidence that there is indeed a contribution of @xmath216% of the thick - disk wd density or @xmath210.8% of the local halo density , by a population of wds that exhibits kinematic properties that are not dissimilar to that expected from a nearly pressure - supported halo population .      to place the results obtained above in perspective , we now turn to a comparison of the local density of wds that we derived with other local densities .",
    "summarising , the local mass densities of wds , derived in this paper , were @xmath208 , @xmath209 and @xmath210  m@xmath15  pc@xmath10 , respectively , for the halo , thick - disc and total mass density ( including thin disc ) , if we convert number densities to densities using an average wd mass of 0.6  m@xmath15 . the local wd density derived from direct observations is @xmath211  m@xmath15  pc@xmath10 ( holberg , oswalt & sion 2001 ) .",
    "these direct observations compare well with our total wd density estimate . because of the very small volume probed by the proper - motion limited survey of oppenheimer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for the lowest velocity thin - disc wds , the error on our estimate is very large .",
    "we found @xmath213 plausible thin - disc wds ( sect.6 ; fig.8 ) .",
    "if we had found one wd less , with comparable or lower velocities , the total density estimate could easily have halfed .",
    "the low number statistics of thin - disc wds , which dominate the local wd density , makes the integrated density estimate of local wds very uncertain .",
    "this is much less of a problem for both the thick - disc and halo density estimates , because in both cases the probed volume is significantly larger ( 23 orders of magnitude ) and consequently also the number of wds from both populations .",
    "the local stellar density is around @xmath212  m@xmath15  pc@xmath10 ( e.g. pham 1997 ; creze et al .",
    "1998 ; holmberg & flynn 2000 ) . the mass density ratio of wds to stars is therefore about 46% .",
    "this fraction is 23 times less than the @xmath2113% estimated by hansen ( 2001 ) .",

    "the result is almost independent of any assumption , except for the shape and lower mass limit of the imf .",
    "we return to this apparent discrepancy in  7.2 .    the local halo density in dark matter is estimated to be @xmath213  m@xmath15  pc@xmath10 ( gates et al . 1995 ; where we take the result that does _ not _ include the microlensing constraints ) .",
    "this result agrees with those determined by other authors .",

    "our density estimate of wds is therefore @xmath215 times larger than that previously estimated and is comparable in mass to the local stellar halo density .",
    "such a high density in halo wds demands a non - standard explanation , other than that based on simple population synthesis models and/or a standard imf .",
    "we discuss this in more detail in  7.2 .",
    "first , however , we examine the contribution of these high - velocity wds to the non - local halo mass density , which allows us to estimate their total mass contribution to the galaxy , under some simplifying assumptions .",
    "combining the results of sections 5 and 6 we now have a normalised halo distribution function in the form @xmath216 evaluated at the solar radius ( @xmath217  kpc ) .",
    "what does this tell us about the total white - dwarf density throughout the halo ?",
    "the connection is provided by the collisionless boltzmann ( or vlasov ) equation which states that the distribution function does not vary along a dynamical trajectory .",
    "therefore , if we knew the halo potential @xmath218 as well as the local velocity distribution function , we would know the halo distribution function at radius @xmath134 and colatitude @xmath219 for all velocities that connect to the solar radius .",
    "( we assume that the distribution functions is symmetric . )",
    "we now make a further simplification and assume that the galactic potential , @xmath218=@xmath220 , is spherically symmetric .",
    "specifically , we adopt eqn.([eq : potential ] ) although our results are not particularly sensitive to this choice . in making this assumption",
    ", we are ignoring the effects of the disk matter which will retard the wds as they move to high latitude , an effect that is relatively small for the high velocity , halo stars of interest .",
    "however , this is a bad approximation for the two disc components",
    ".    a wd on a high latitude orbit will oscillate in radius between a minimum and a maximum radius determined by energy and angular momentum conservation .",
    "as the orbit does not close , the ap- and perigalacticons ( @xmath221 ) will eventually become arbitrarily close to the galactic disk .",
    "therefore as we are assuming axisymmetry , ( and the orbital precession that would be present in a more realistic non - spherical potential will obviate the need for this assumption ) , we are locally sampling the halo velocity distribution at @xmath222 for halo velocities @xmath223 for which @xmath224 .",

    "similarly , if the luminosity of halo stars is @xmath257  l@xmath15 ( bm98 ; conveniently assuming solar colors for the halo stars ) and @xmath258=4.3 , one finds @xmath259 .",
    "if these values are typical for l@xmath260 galaxies , then the integrated luminosity of halo wds in @xmath68-band will be @xmath215 mag fainter that that of halo stars , both of which are of course significantly fainter than the stellar disc .",
    "we conclude that it will be exceedingly difficult to observed such a faint halo around external galaxies .",
    "this is made even harder , because this emission is spread over a much larger solid angle on the sky than for example the stellar disc .",
    "we now turn the crucial question : if the density of halo wds is as high as the observations , taken at face value , and our subsequent calculations indicate , where did all these wds come from ?",
    "the apparent similarity in magnitude , color and age between the high - velocity halo and low - velocity thick - disc wds ( fig.1 ; hansen 2001 ) , suggests that the halo wds originate in the disc and are subsequently ejected into the halo , through a process yet unknown to us .",
    "their disc - origin is supported by the low density of halo stars ( e.g. gould et al .",
    "if halo stars and wds come from the same ( halo ) population , there should be significantly more stars than wds in the halo for any reasonable imf .",
    "one possibility is that binary or triple star interactions eject stars into the halo with high velocities ( socalled runaway stars ) , although not preferentially wds .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that a large population of wds were born in globular clusters on radial orbits or satellite galaxies that have been destroyed by tidal forces over the past 10  gyr , through which most of their stars end up in the bulge .",
    "both scenarios are speculative and also do not satisfactory explain why the ratio of wds to stars is so high in the halo .",
    "we propose another possible mechanism , in which most of the high - velocity wds orginate from unstable triple stellar systems .",
    "observations indicate that a high fraction ( @xmath2130% ) of binary stars in the solar neighborhood have a companion and are in fact triples ( e.g. petri & batten 1965 ; batten 1967 ) .",
    "if for example the third outer - orbit star , or one of the binary stars , evolves into a wd or goes supernova , or if matter can flow between the different stars ( e.g. through roche - lobe overflows and/or stellar winds ) an initially stable system can change its ratio of orbital periods and at some point become unstable , if the ratio of orbital periods ( @xmath261 , the ratio of the largest over smallest orbital period ) exceeds a critical value ( e.g. anosova & orlov 1989 ; kiseleva , eggleton , & anosova 1994 ; anosova , colin , & kiseleva 1996 ) that depends on the mass ratio of the outer star and the inner binary .",
    "the outer - orbit star , often an evolved star itself , can then be ejected from the triple system with a high spatial velocity ( e.g worrall 1967 ) , giving the inner compact binary system a `` kick '' in opposite direction , with a typical velocity observed for compact binaries in the disc ( e.g. iben & tutukov 1999 ) and comparable to the orbital velocity of the compact binary .",
    "a second possibility is that the most massive star of the inner binary evolves into a wd , without the binary merging ( iben & tutukov 1999 ) , changing the orbital period and making the system unstable .",
    "also in this case the wd can be ejected , leaving behind a recoiled binary .",
    "besides explaining why even young wds ( few gyr ) are observed with high velocities , a consequence of such a mechanism is that the total mass in high - velocity wds ( e.g. those in the halo ) , must be related to the integrated stellar mass in our galaxy and the fraction of the stellar imf in unstable multiple ( e.g. triple ) systems .",
    "the estimated stellar mass in our galaxy is roughly @xmath262  m@xmath15 ( bt87 ) .",
    "if @xmath2115% of the stellar mass equals the total galactic wd mass , based on simple population synthesis models (  6.1 ) , the inferred galactic wd mass should be @xmath263  m@xmath15 . in ",
    "6.1 , we estimated from observations that the local wd mass fraction was only @xmath215% , which then corresponds to @xmath264  m@xmath15 if this fraction holds throughout the disc .",
    "we estimated @xmath265  m@xmath15 for the mass in halo wds ( sect.7 ) , which then adds to a total wd mass of @xmath266  m@xmath15 .",
    "there are , however , a number of difficulties associated with the process described above .",
    "first , it implies that one out of every two wds must be ejected from the disc , with an average rate of one wd every @xmath214 years , for an assumed galactic age of @xmath25  gyr .",
    "second , it is not known what the birth rate and orbital parameters of triple ( or higher - order ) systems are .",
    "in particular , a large fraction of stellar systems could be intrisically unstable when they form .",
    "such systems have been observed ( e.g. ressler & barsony 2001 ) , although their ultimate fate is unknown .",
    "the instability of triple systems is particularly evident when comparing their orbital periods ( e.g. tokovinin 1997 ; iben & tutkov 1999 ) , which shows a complete absence of triple systems with @xmath267 ( i.e. the lowest theoretical limit for stability ; e.g. kiseleva 1994 ) , whereas there is no a priori reason to suspect that systems with these orbital period ratios are not formed .",
    "a more typical ratio @xmath261 where systems becomes unstable is @xmath214 .",
    "examining the distribution of @xmath268 in more detail reveals some clustering of triple stellar systems close to the stability limit for larger orbital periods ( tokovinin 1997 ; iben & tutukov 1999 ) , although it is not clear whether that could be a selection effect . for the lower period systems this clustering is",
    "not the case .",
    "third , because evolving triple stars have not been studied in as much detail as binaries , for example , the velocity of the ejected wds is not well known in these processes , although it can be estimated from analytical models and numerical simulations .    as a rough rule of thumb",
    ", stable triple systems can be separated into a close binary ( masses @xmath269 and @xmath270 ) and a more distant companion ( mass @xmath271 ) with period ratio exceeding @xmath272 ( see above ) .",
    "let us consider two options .",
    "firstly , suppose that @xmath269 is the most massive star and that it evolves to fill its roche lobe and transfer mass , conservatively , onto @xmath270 .",
    "this will initially shrink the orbit and increase the period ratio until @xmath273 when the separation is @xmath274 .",
    "further mass transfer will then lead to an increase of the close binary orbit and a reduction of the period ratio @xmath275 . as the close binary orbit expands , the proto ",
    "wd speed @xmath276 will initially increase @xmath277 and then decrease .",
    "for example , with @xmath278  m@xmath15 , @xmath279  m@xmath15 initially the close binary period could decrease by a factor @xmath247 by the time @xmath280  m@xmath15 and , provided that the companion s orbital radius @xmath281 , the orbit can become unstable at this point . if @xmath269 is ejected by a slingshot effect involving @xmath271 , then a characteristic velocity at infinity is @xmath282 .",
    "higher speeds are possible with favorable orbits , especially retrograde companion orbits .",
    "secondly , suppose that @xmath283 .",
    "the mass transfer is less likely to be conservative although there is likely to be a net loss of orbital angular momentum associated with the loss of mass .",
    "the net result is that the outer binary orbit will initially shrink , again promoting instability .",
    "general analytical and numerical analyses of triple - star systems , randomly placed in a spherical volume , show that most ( @xmath5280% ) systems are unstable and typically eject the lowest mass star with a median velocity comparable to their orbital velocity ( e.g. standish 1972 ; monaghan 1976a , b ; sterzik & durisen 1998 ) , as also indicated above .",
    "a more detailed analysis by sterzik & durisen ( 1998 ) , where the ejection velocity distribution is weighted by the stellar mass function , shows that @xmath2110 percent of the ejected stars ( e.g. wds ) have velocities @xmath523 times the typical orbital velocity .",
    "given their stellar mass function , the typical mass of an evolved triple - star systems is then @xmath215  m@xmath15 . as we saw previously ,",
    "if the orbital radius is of the order of the stellar radius ( i.e. orbital periods of several days ) , escape velocities of several hundred kms@xmath5can be reached . for orbital periods of several hundred days ( e.g. tokovinin 1997 )",
    ", the typical orbital velocity will still be @xmath2180  kms@xmath5 .",
    "wds have to gain a velocity of @xmath21100150  kms@xmath5  ( in addition to their orbital velocity and velocity with respect to their lsr ) to atain velocities comparable to the observed high - velocity wds .",
    "hence , the proposed mechanism quite easily reaches the required velocities . even in those systems with longer orbital periods ( @xmath211000 days )",
    ", several tens of percent of the escaping stars will atain very high velocities ( e.g. sterzik & durisen  1998 ) .",
    "additional support for the notion that these processes might be quite common , could be the good agreement which valtonen ( 1998 ) recently found between the observed mass ratio of binaries and that determined from a statistical theory of three - body disruption ( monaghan 1976a , b ) .",
    "this might indicate that many stars are born in triple or higher - order systems , which become unstable and eject stars until only a stable binary is left .    in order to explore this hypothesis",
    "further , we have constructed a relatively simple model of the galaxy as follows ; we suppose that the mass comprises a spherical halo @xmath284 with @xmath285  kpc , which generates a logarithmic potential , and a disc @xmath286 with @xmath287  kpc and a bulge , which we for simplicity flatten onto the galactic plane , @xmath288 with @xmath289  kpc .",
    "the combination of these potentials gives a nearly flat rotation curve beyond several kpc ( e.g. dehnen & binney 1998a ) , with circular velocity @xmath290  kms@xmath5 .",
    "as the potential is no longer spherically symmetric , the total angular momentum is not an integral of motion .    given this model of the galaxy , it is then a straighforward matter to follow the trajectories of observed wds back in . in order to measure the contemporary wd source velocity distribution ( per unit disk mass , per unit time , per unit speed ) , which we denote by @xmath291",
    ", we must make some assumptions . to keep matters simple ,",
    "we suppose that @xmath291 is independent of radius and decreases with lookback time , @xmath292 $ ] , where @xmath293 as indicated by the data exhibited in fig .  1 .",
    "as individual orbits quickly sample a large range of disk radii it is not easy to derive the radial launch rate from the local wd distribution function .",
    "the best approach utilizing the present data set is to fit the halo distribution function from table .  1",
    ".    we use again jeans theorem to relate the observed vdf @xmath294 to that at the source .",
    "adopt one point in local velocity space and relate to @xmath291 through @xmath295,\\ ] ] where the sum takes account of @xmath296 disk crossings along the orbit .",
    "the weights @xmath297 are given by @xmath298}{4\\pi v_j^2v_{jz}}\\ ] ] and @xmath299 , @xmath300 and @xmath301 are evaluated at the j - th disk crossing .",
    "we next discretize @xmath302 using 50  kms@xmath5  bins and develop a least squares solution to eq.(22 ) @xmath303 where we sample the distribution function at n random points .",
    "the result indicates that the mean speed of the wd at launch is very high , @xmath304=250300  km s@xmath5 , with a birth rate of @xmath2110@xmath305  ( m@xmath15  kms@xmath5  gyr)@xmath5 at these velocities , consistent with @xmath2110% of the stellar mass in the galactic disc having been transformed in wds .",
    "the low rotational velocity of the observed wds requires them to originate in the inner 23  kpc of the galactic disk , so they loose most of their rotational velocity when climbing out of the galactic potential to the solar neighborhood .",
    "the latter result is not unexpected , because most stellar mass ( @xmath2175% for a disk scale length of @xmath3063  kpc ) lies inside the solar radius and in addition @xmath307 peaks at @xmath308 .",
    "hence a typical wd is expected to originate in the disc at @xmath309  kpc .",
    "these calculations are consistent with , though do not require , that the wds are a product of stellar evolution in the disk .",
    "three lines of evidence support this conclusion .",
    "( i ) the age distribution is just about what would be expected from a population of main sequence stars with a reasonable mass function from @xmath210.8  m@xmath15 to @xmath216  m@xmath15 .",
    "the stars are born at a rate consistent with stellar evolution .",
    "the most populous stars are of mass @xmath310  m@xmath15 and take @xmath311  gyr to evolve .",
    "even if the galaxy is @xmath312  gyr old , we do not expect a large proportion of stars with ages @xmath313  gyr .",
    "a more careful , galactic synthesis model is consistent with these statements .",
    "( ii ) the velocities are isotropic with no discernible asymmetric drift .",
    "this is just what would be expected from a disk population that launches wds in random directions .",
    "the median speed observed is @xmath21200300  km s@xmath5 .",
    "( iii ) the radial variation of white - dwarf sources appears to fall with radius in a similar fashion to the the stellar distribution .",
    "of course , the situation is far more complex than this .",
    "however , the similarities between the characteristic escape speed and the halo velocity dispersion , together with the shortage of viable alternatives makes this a scenario that is worth investigating further .",
    "but it should again be emphasized that a much larger sample of halo wds is needed to place the above simple estimates on a more firm basis .",
    "the next question to ask is whether the population of wds in the halo can explain the observed microlensing events towards the large magellanic cloud , with optical depth @xmath314 ( alcock et al .",
    "2000 ) . using the local density and the global density profile of the population of wds in the halo , derived in the previous sections ,",
    "it is possible to integrate over the density profile along the line - of - sight toward to lmc ( @xmath315 , @xmath316 and @xmath317  kpc ) and obtain the optical depth for any arbitrary set of parameters for the local vdf .    for the most likely model , listed in table  1 ( full data set ) , we compute a microlensing optical depth of the halo wds , @xmath318 .",
    "the optical depth of the thick disc is @xmath319 .",
    "hence , even in the most optimistic case , the integrated thick - disc plus halo wds have an optical depth that is still 12 orders of magnitude below that observed .",
    "this difference can not be made up by a , most likely small , incompleteness of high - velocity wds .",
    "if we scale the results in section 6 and 7 to the lmc itself , assuming ( i ) a similar shape of the velocity ellipsoid , ( ii ) velocities that scale with a factor @xmath320 ( @xmath321  kms@xmath5 ; e.g. alves & nelson 2000 ) and distances that scale as @xmath322=constant , and ( iii ) the ratio of total wd mass to stellar mass in the lmc is similar to that inferred in our galaxy ( @xmath219% from @xmath323  m@xmath15 ; e.g. alves & nelson 2000 ) , we find a self - lensing microlensing optical depth for the center of the lmc of @xmath324 , lower than the results from the macho collaboration ( alcock et al .",
    "we find that the results are quite sensitive to the assumped parameters , especially the velocity dispersion .",
    "the wd density is @xmath325 and gets unbounded if the velocity dispersion is lower somewhat .",
    "this illustrates that a `` shroud '' of white dwarfs around the lmc ( e.g. evans & kerins 2000 ) , in principle , could account for the observed optical depth , although it does require that 50% of the halo wd mass is concentrated in the inner 0.7  kpc and rather fine - tuned model parameters .",
    "the latter could be overcome if the mass profile of the lmc has a finite core .",
    "a similarly rough scaling for the edge - on spiral gravitational lens b1600 + 434  where we assume 4 times more mass in wds than in b1600 + 434  suggests @xmath326 along the line - of - sight towards lensed image a , at 6  kpc above the galaxy plane .",
    "this optical depth appears insufficient to explain the apparent radio - microlensing events in this system ( e.g. koopmans & de bruyn 2000 ; koopmans et al . 2001 ) .",
    "we stress the large uncertainties associated with these extrapolated calculations .",
    "as we have discussed , the main reason why it is hard to determine the halo density of the observed wd is that the sample surrounds the sgp and that we have poor resolution of the vertical velocity @xmath43 . in order to choose between various possible local distribution functions , it is necessary to repeat the survey at lower galactic latitude .",
    "we discuss two potential surveys for the near future that allow a rigorous test of some of these underlying assumptions .      in fig.11 , we show the probability distribution of proper motions , seen in the direction of the galactic anti - center ( @xmath327 and @xmath328 ) . for simplicity",
    "we adopt the same survey limits as used by oppenheimer et al ( 2001 ) and a standard - candle wd with an average absolute magnitude @xmath329 .",
    "the latter translates into a maximum survey depth of @xmath21125  pc .",
    "we used our most - likely model in the calculation .",
    "if a wd survey in this particular direction shows a proper - motion distribution similar to that in fig.11 , it would be strong support to the notion that the wds with high velocities in the @xmath45 plane also have high velocities in the @xmath43direction and therefore form a genuine halo population .",
    "a significantly flattened proper - motion distribution would support a thick - disc interpretation of the sample found by oppenheimer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , but requires a rather artificial vdf .      a new opportunity to measure wd proper motions",
    "is presented by the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) .",
    "it is likely that it will be proper - motion limited , rather than magnitude limited .",
    "scaling from the astrometry carried out by ibata et al .",
    "( 1999 ) on the hdf , and requiring that the transverse velocities be measured to an accuracy @xmath2130  kms@xmath5 , we estimate that a `` wide '' survey to a depth @xmath211.2  mag shallower than the hdf(n ) could be carried out to a limit @xmath330 over @xmath331  ster rad ( @xmath210.3 square degree ) and a `` deep '' survey could reach @xmath332 to a depth @xmath333  mag deeper than the hdf(n ) over @xmath334  ster rad ( @xmath21120 square arcmin ) .",
    "the expected number of halo wds in these fields is @xmath335 where @xmath336 measures the distance along the line of sight . evaluating this integral for the direction of the hdf(n )",
    ", we find that @xmath337 for the wide survey and @xmath338 for the deep survey .",
    "evaluating the luminosity for the high - velocity wds , we find that the number density per magnitude is roughly constant in the range 13@xmath27@xmath339@xmath2716  mag .",
    "this gives us @xmath340 the wide survey will typically observe to a distance of @xmath210.5  kpc , whereas the deep survey should see to @xmath211  kpc .",
    "the expected number in the existing wfpc2 observations of the hdf(n ) is @xmath210.1 and the negative report of richer ( 2001 ) is not surprising .",
    "of course , these calculations are only illustrative .",
    "more wds are expected to be found associated with the thick disc and would be seen along lines of sight that look closer to the inner galaxy .",
    "however , it is clear that if we can measure the white - dwarf colors and proper motions over a few directions , then we can use the distribution function approach , outlined above , to measure the wd density throughout a major portion of the halo .",
    "we have analysed the results of oppenheimer et al . ( 2001 ) and argued that there appear to be at least two kinematically distinct populations of wds ( at the @xmath9699% c.l . ) , which one might term a thick disc and a flattened halo population , respectively .",
    "in contrast , these populations are indistinguishable in their luminosity , color and age distribution .",
    "our most likely model indicates that the halo wds constitute @xmath210.8  percent of the nominal local halo density , although this fraction decreases as @xmath341@xmath342 with increasing galacto - centric radius @xmath343 , for an assumed galactic density profile @xmath344 . a more conservative lower limit of 0.3 percent ( 90% c.l .",
    ") can be placed on the local halo mass fraction in wds .",
    "this wd density is 5.0@xmath345 ( 90% c.l . ) times higher than previously thought and comparable to the local stellar halo density ( gould et al .",
    "this is in conflict with the estimates of wd densities , based on population synthesis models and salpeter initial mass functions , and requires a non - standard explanation if one requires these wds to be formed in the halo .",
    "based on the notion that 90% of the wds , found by oppenheimer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , are proper - motion limited ( sect.6 ) , we do not expect the white - dwarf luminosity function to rise sharply beyond the survey magnitude limit ( i.e. wds with ages @xmath9610  gyr ) , although a distinct very faint population of wds with ages @xmath34610  gyr , which are not related to the presently observed population , can not be excluded .",
    "we find that the halo wd population is flattened ( @xmath347 ) , and expect @xmath241 to become somewhat smaller once a more realistic flattened potential of the disk , bulge and halo is used in the models .",
    "the value for @xmath241 that we quote should be regarded as an upper limit .",
    "the microlensing optical depth inferred from the halo wd population is estimated at @xmath348 . even if we include the contribution from the thick disk , the optical depth remains @xmath555% of that observed toward the lmc ( @xmath349 ; alcock et al .",
    "we conclude that the population of halo wds , observed by oppenheimer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and on orbits that are probed by the velocity distribution function in the solar neighborhood , do not contribute significantly to the observed microlensing events toward the lmc .",
    "one avoids this , if either @xmath2125 times more wds are on orbits with perigalacticons well outside the solar neighborhood ( for example a mass shell ) or on resonant orbits .",
    "both types of orbits could be undersampled locally . similarly , as mentioned above , if there exists yet another population of very faint old ( @xmath2115  gyr ) wds in the halo , they could also increase the number of microlensing events towards the lmc .",
    "however , we regard both solutions as unlikely and artificial . in addition",
    ", both solutions would violate constraints from metal abundances ( see sect.1 ) and ( simple ) population synthesis models .",
    "in sect.8 , we showed that a similar `` shroud '' of white dwarfs around the lmc itself , in principle , can account for the observed optical depth , although the result is strongly model dependent .",
    "we have performed a number of consistency checks of the data .",
    "for example , we find excellent agreement between the maximum - likelihood value of the asymmetric drift , the statistical value and the value inferred from other stellar population in the solar neighborhood .",
    "there is also no evidence for either a drift of the wd population in the @xmath41 or @xmath43 direction , which could have indicated that the population was not in dynamic equilibrium or could be part of a stellar stream or group . in both cases",
    "our approach , based on the collisionless boltzmann ( or vlasov ) equation , would have been invalid .",
    "in addition , the thick - disc likelihood results agree well with the empirical relation between the asymmetric drift ( @xmath166 ) and the radial velocity dispersion ( @xmath125 ) , determined from a range of local stellar populations .",
    "we also find that the asymmetric drift of the halo population is close to that ( i.e. @xmath350 ) expected for a population that is mostly pressure supported ( i.e. @xmath351 ) .",
    "if we assume that @xmath125=@xmath126 for the wd population , the likelihood decreases by a factor @xmath352 and the thick - disc result no longer agree with the empiral relation .",
    "a flattened velocity ellipsoid ( @xmath125@xmath27@xmath126 ) naturally explains the relative scarcity of wds in the regions around @xmath50  kms@xmath5  and @xmath167  kms@xmath5 , noticed by reid et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "the absence of any clear correlations of velocity with color , absolute magnitude or age , and the dynamical self - consistency checks give us confidence that the population of wds found by oppenheimer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) does not contain a significantly hidden bias .",
    "especially , the fact that the survey is 90% proper - motion limited , not magnitude - limited , underlines that we do not miss many wds that are too faint ( but see the comments above ) .",
    "the range of luminosities should thus provide a reasonable representation of the underlying luminosity function of this particular population of halo wds .",
    "these internal and external consistency checks should make our results quite robust .",
    "however , there are uncertainties associated with errors in the photometric parallaxes which feed into both the densities and velocities . in addition",
    ", several of the wds in this sample might belong to binaries , although an inspection of the two - color diagram ( fig.1 ) suggests that also this is unlikely to be a major problem .",
    "only a systematic overestimate of distances by a factor @xmath522.5 would move most high - velocity wds into the thick - disc regime , but would also result in a typical velocity dispersion of the sample only half that of the thick disc and average wd luminosities that are too small .",
    "the absence of apparent correlations with the wd velocities , makes it unlikely that distance overestimates would preferentially occur for the highest velocity wds .",
    "another way out of the conclusion that there exists a significant population of halo wds , would be to accept that the velocity ellipsoid of these high proper - motion wds is significantly flattened in the vertical direction .",
    "although , this would be consistent with the observations , as we indicated in sect.5 , it would require a highly unusual vdf , unlike what is observed for both young and old stellar populations in the solar neighborhood .",
    "we have also provided further evidence that the fast and slow wds come from the same population .",
    "this would not be a surprise if they were mostly born in the disk and then deflected dynamically to high altitude .",
    "we have proposed a possible mechanism that could preferentially eject wds from the disc , involving orbital instabilities in evolving multiple ( e.g. triple ) stellar systems (  7.2 ) .",
    "we showed that the total halo plus disc wd mass of the galaxy ( i.e. @xmath2115% of its stellar mass ) is roughly consistent with that expected from the total stellar mass in our galaxy , based on standard population synthesis models .",
    "the agreement suggests that not a re - thinking of galactic starformation models is required , but that the real question is how to eject disc wds into the halo with high velocities .",
    "we propose that this can be achieved through the orbital instabilities in evolving multiple stellar systems .",
    "the key to understanding the wd distribution with more confidence is undoubtedly to measure the component of velocity perpendicular to the galactic disk and this is best accomplished with a proper motion survey at lower latitude .",
    "we have suggested two possible surveys for the near future : one towards to galactic anti - center , similar to the survey discussed in this paper , and one that could be done with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on hst .",
    "the first survey could unambiguously show that the velocity dispersion perpendicular to the disc is comparable to that parallel to the disc . measuring the density of wds as a function of galacto - centric radius ( for example with the acs ) , together with a local wd density calibration , can provide strong constraints on the shape of the galactic potential , as is apparent from eqns ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) in sect.7 .",
    "these constraints improve dramatically if we can also constrain the vdf at the same points in the halo .",
    "this is especially relevant in case of the halo wds , even though they are faint , because their high velocity dispersion allows one to probe large ( tens of kpc ) galacto - centric distances and still be in dynamic contact with the solar neighborhood .",
    "the relation between the vdfs at different radii is then given through the integrals of motion that are conserved along orbits between these points and the galactic potential .",
    "measuring the density and vdfs along these orbits can then , in principle , be used to reconstruct the galactic potential .",
    "it is also surprising that the scale height of wds , kinematically belonging to the thin disc , appears at least twice that previously thought ( majewski & siegel 2001 ) .",
    "could this population form a bridge to a flattened white - dwarf halo population ?    we conclude that the discovery of a surprisingly large population of high velocity , old wds , made possible by advances in understanding their atmospheres and colors , is a significant accomplishment and seems to opens up a new unexpected window into the stellar archaeology of our galaxy . however , to confirm or reject the ideas put forward by oppenheimer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and in this paper a significantly large sample is required , not only out of the galactic plance , but also in the galactic plane .",
    "in addition deeper surveys ( e.g. with the acs ) could probe much farther into the halo and possibly even detect wds that are significantly fainter .",
    "deeper surveys would also be able to probe the transition between thick - disc and halo and be less ` contaminted ' by disc wds .",
