    "@xcite first established that type ia supernovae ( sne ) are _ standardizable _ candles at optical wavelengths : there is a correlation between their absolute magnitudes at maximum light and the rate at which these objects fade .",
    "this fact allowed type ia sne to be used to determine that the expansion of the universe is currently accelerating @xcite .",
    "more recently , we have discovered that in near - infrared ( ir ) photometric bands type ia sne are _ standard _ candles @xcite . except for a fraction of the rapidly declining type ia sne",
    "whose prototype is sn  1991bg @xcite , which peak in the near - ir after the time of @xmath1-band maximum , the near - ir absolute magnitudes at maximum light are at most only slightly dependent on the decline - rate parameter  @xcite .",
    "we do not understand well how to model a type ia sn .",
    "for much of the previous decade we thought that ( most ) type ia sne were carbon - oxygen white dwarfs that approach the chandrasekhar limit ( 1.4 m@xmath8 ) owing to mass transfer from a nearby companion ( for a review , see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "some type ia sne might be mergers of two white dwarfs @xcite . over the past few years",
    "the double - degenerate scenario has gained prominence among many researchers .",
    "unfortunately , it is not yet possible to determine with a high degree of probability that a given type ia sn is a single or double - degenerate event , except perhaps for the few that produced more than a chandrasekhar mass of fusion products ; these would result from double - degenerate mergers .",
    "an excellent summary of evidence for different kinds of progenitors of type ia sne is given by @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic classification scheme stipulates that type i sne do not exhibit obvious hydrogen in their spectra , and that type ii sne do show prominent hydrogen @xcite ; see @xcite for a review .",
    "type ia sne show si  ii in absorption , blueshifted from its rest wavelength at 6355   .",
    "two objects have been shown to have strong si  ii in absorption and h@xmath7 in emission : sn  2002ic @xcite and sn  2005gj @xcite .",
    "the interpretation is that these objects are type ia sne interacting with circumstellar material ( csm ) or ( less likely ) with the general interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "sn  2006x was found to exhibit variable na  i  d absorption @xcite .",
    "two other examples showing variable na  i absorption are sn  1999cl @xcite and sn  2006dd @xcite .",
    "light from the sne is ionizing the circumstellar medium .",
    "this leads to recombination and line variations .",
    "it should be pointed out that sne  1999cl and 2006x have large reddening that may involve multiple scattering as well as normal dust extinction @xcite .",
    "it is possible to relate the peak bolometric luminosity of a type ia sn and the implied amount of radioactive @xmath6ni produced in the explosion .",
    "most events generate between 0.4 and 0.7 m@xmath8 of @xmath6ni @xcite .",
    "the remarkable sn  2003fg ( also known as snls-03d3bb ; * ? ? ?",

    ", the more massive white dwarf can tidally disrupt the less massive white dwarf , which has a larger radius .",
    "a disk or shell of material is created , retarding the expansion of the more massive white dwarf once it explodes . another object with",

    "in this paper we present optical and near - ir photometry , plus a plethora of spectra , of the equally remarkable sn  2001ay .",
    "preliminary analysis of the light curve and spectra of sn  2001ay is given by @xcite .",
    "two _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ stis spectra ( from 2001 may 2 and may 9 ) have already been published by @xcite , in a study of possible luminosity indicators in the ultraviolet ( uv ) spectra of type ia sne .",
    "sn  2001ay was discovered on 2001 april 18.4 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) by @xcite .",
    "its position was @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( j2000 ) , some @xmath14 west and @xmath15 north of the nucleus of the spiral galaxy ic 4423 .",

    "figure [ finder ] shows the host galaxy and sn , and identifies a number of field stars of interest .",
    "a sizable fraction of our optical photometry of sn  2001ay was obtained with the 0.76-m katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ) at lick observatory @xcite .",
    "kait images are @xmath16 in size , with a scale of @xmath17 per pixel .",
    "for the first three nights of photometry with the lick observatory nickel 1-m telescope , the ccd camera had a chip with @xmath18 pixels in @xmath19 readout mode and gave a field size of @xmath20 .",

    "the @xmath24 photometry of some field stars near sn  2001ay is found in table [ ubvri_field ] .",
    "calibration of optical photometry was accomplished from observations carried out on five photometric nights ( two with the ctio 0.9-m , two with the nickel , and one with the ctio 1.5-m telescopes ) using the standard stars of @xcite .",

    "our data presented here were reduced in the iraf environment .",
    "transformation of the data to the system of @xcite was accomplished using equations equivalent to those of @xcite . in their table 1 , the reader will find characteristic color terms used for the transformations .",

    "the @xmath28-band magnitude was determined from aperture photometry ; no @xmath28-band template was available .",

    "computes the time since maximum brightness , and then obtains a rest - frame timescale by dividing the differential times by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the object s heliocentric redshift .",
    "we have worked out the optical k - corrections using actual spectra of sn  2001ay , adopting the @xcite filter profiles as reference ; these are given in table [ opt_kcorrs ] and shown in figure [ kcorr ] .    to account for differences in sn photometry that result from the use of different telescopes , ccd chips , and filters , we use the method of spectroscopic corrections ( s - corrections ) , as outlined by @xcite and @xcite . for optical bands we adopt as reference the filter specifications of @xcite .",
    "_ at minimum _",
    "one constructs the effective filter profiles using the laboratory transmission curves of the filters multiplied by an appropriate atmospheric function that includes atmospheric absorption lines ; then , one multiplies that result by the quantum efficiency of the ccd chip as a function of wavelength .",
    "telescope and instrument optics also contribute to the effective filter profiles . for the kait and nickel 1-m corrections",
    "we have used an atmospheric function appropriate to lick observatory ( elevation 1290 m ) .",
    "for the ctio 0.9-m data we have used a different atmospheric function appropriate to cerro tololo ( elevation 2215 m ) . in practice",
    ", one arbitrarily shifts the effective filter profiles toward longer or shorter wavelengths so that synthetic photometry based on spectra of standard stars gives color terms that match those obtained from actual photometry of photometric standards .",
    "we used spectra of 50 stars from the sample of @xcite to calculate our synthetic magnitudes using an iraf script written by one of us ( n.b.s . ) .",
    "this script was then used to calculate the s - corrections based on spectra of sn  2001ay itself .    in figure [ scorr_bv ]",
    "we show the @xmath1- and @xmath31-band s - corrections for sn  2001ay .",
    "one _ adds _ these corrections to the photometry .",
    "as one can see in figure [ scorr_bv ] , if an object like sn  2001ay were observed with the ctio 0.9-m and nickel 1-m telescopes , there could be photometric discrepancies as large as @xmath32 mag in the @xmath1 band , depending on the epoch . in the @xmath31 band",
    "the corresponding differences are much smaller .    even after the application of the s - corrections",
    ", we find that the nickel 1-m @xmath1-band data based on aperture magnitudes are systematically 0.09 mag fainter than the kait measurements .",
    "for the first three nights of nickel imaging we were able to eliminate these systematic differences by means of template subtraction .",
    "the images subsequently obtained with the nickel 1-m telescope and its newer chip did not lend themselves to image subtraction using the kait templates .",
    "( depending on the number of field stars , the angular size of a nearby galaxy in the field , and the seeing , the image rescaling and remapping algorithm can fail . ) as a result , we have devised a third set of corrections to the photometry based on images with the new chip in the nickel camera . using addstar within the daophot package of iraf , we were able to add an artificial star to the kait image - subtraction templates at the pixel location of the sn .",
    "this artificial star can be scaled to give a standard magnitude of a desired value such as @xmath1 = 17.97 and @xmath31 = 17.14 mag , just about the brightness of the sn on 2001 may 14 ( jd 2,452,043.8 ) , in the middle of the run of nickel 1-m aperture photometry .",
    "artificial stars having the identical psf magnitude as the fake star at the location of the sn are placed at blank places in the kait templates using addstar .",
    "since the nickel 1-m aperture photometry was typically derived with a software aperture of radius 10 pixels ( px ) and a sky annulus ranging from 12 to 20 px , we can then compare the aperture magnitudes of the fake sn with aperture photometry of the fake stars in the blank places of the image .",
    "we use a software aperture radius and sky annulus of identical size in _ arc seconds _ to that used for the nickel 1-m photometry . in this way",
    ", we can obtain an estimate of the systematic errors of the sn aperture photometry .",
    "we determined that the @xmath1-band magnitudes from nickel 1-m aperture photometry of the sn were 0.08 mag fainter than what we would have measured without the presence of the host galaxy .",
    "similarly , in the @xmath31 band we found that the nickel 1-m aperture magnitudes were fainter by 0.05 mag .",
    "for the two nights of ctio 0.9-m aperture photometry , when the sn was more than 1 mag brighter , the sn was too faint by 0.03 mag in @xmath1 and @xmath31 without this correction .",
    "thus , by applying the s - corrections and these additional corrections , we can reconcile almost all systematic differences in the @xmath1- and @xmath31-band photometry obtained with different telescopes , using different cameras , and using different data - reduction methods ( i.e. , psf magnitudes with image - subtraction templates vs. aperture magnitudes without subtractions ) .",
    "further justification of this method comes from a consideration of the optical photometry from the first nickel 1-m chip and the photometry from one night with the ctio 1.5-m telescope .",
    "data from these four nights _ can _ be derived using the kait host - galaxy templates . in the @xmath1 band ,",
    "photometry of the sn using psf magnitudes and image subtraction was 0.07 to 0.16 mag brighter than aperture photometry using an annulus for the subtraction of the sky level . in the @xmath31 band ,",
    "the photometric values of the sn on the first three nickel 1-m nights were 0.06 mag brighter than values derived from aperture photometry .",
    "this result is contrary to typical experience ; normally , aperture photometry of a sn is brighter than expected ( not fainter ) if the sn is located on top of some part of the host galaxy , because the light in the aperture is not entirely due to the sn . that this is not the case here",
    "must be due to the relative distributions of host - galaxy light at the sn position and in the sky annulus .",
    "differences between aperture photometry and psf photometry are _ usually _ larger in redder bands . in fact ,",
    "similar experiments with adding artificial stars to the kait templates of sn  2001ay show that the aperture magnitudes with the nickel 1-m telescope are too bright by 0.01 mag in @xmath33 and @xmath34 for the size of the aperture and annulus used .",
    "we never obtained near - ir subtraction templates with the camera used on the las campanas observatory 1-m telescope , and that camera has since been decommissioned .",
    "so , we must adopt the available near - ir aperture magnitudes .",
    "the @xmath34-band photometry is particularly problematic from 15 to 30  d after the time of @xmath1-band maximum .",
    "consider the effective filter profiles shown in figure [ i_filter ] .",
    "while the kait @xmath34-band filter very well approximates the bessell @xmath34 filter , the filter used on the nickel 1-m telescope does not .",
    "as the sn achieved its reddest optical colors , a significant excess amount of light is let through by the nickel 1-m @xmath34-band filter .",
    "this leads to positive s - corrections ; to correct such photometry to bessell filter photometry requires making the nickel 1-m photometry fainter .",
    "our attempts to reconcile up to 0.35 mag differences between the kait and nickel 1-m photometry were not successful .",
    "apparently , the effective filter profile of the nickel 1-m camera is even more nonstandard than our profile based on laboratory traces of the filter , knowledge of the quantum efficiency as a function of wavelength , and a generic atmospheric function applicable to lick observatory . while we list all of our optical photometry in table [ ubvri ] , the nickel 1-m @xmath34-band photometry is not included in our plots or used in the analysis .",
    "the @xmath33- and @xmath34-band s - corrections are shown in figure [ scorr_ri ] .",
    "note that the photometry in table [ ubvri ] includes the k- and s - corrections , plus the corrections mentioned above for ctio 0.9-m and nickel 1-m photometry reduced using aperture magnitudes . since the k - corrected photometry from one night with the yalo 1-m telescope and four nights with the lco 2.5-m telescope are in good agreement with photometry obtained with other telescopes , and we have no effective transmission curves for the lco 2.5-m filters used , we have derived no further corrections for this small fraction of our photometry .",
    "the interpolated @xmath35 k - corrections and s - corrections are listed in table [ corrections ] .    in spite of the rationale outlined above to reconcile as much of the optical photometry as we can , for a derivation of the maximum brightness and decline rate of sn  2001ay we restrict ourselves to the photometry based on psf magnitudes with image subtraction . after subtracting the derived k - corrections and adding the s - corrections , we scale the time since maximum light to the rest frame by dividing by @xmath36 . we derive a time of @xmath1-band maximum of jd 2,452,022.49 (= 2001 april 23.0 ) , with an uncertainty of perhaps @xmath0 0.8  d. the decline - rate parameter found from our best @xmath1-band data",

    "sne 2001ay , 2005eq , 2006gz , 2007if , and 2009dc had extremely slow decline rates . since it is well established that the energy budget of a type ia sn is related to the decline rate , we naturally wonder if sne  2001ay and 2005eq are also super - chandrasekhar - mass candidates .",
    "the @xmath1- and @xmath31-band light curves of sne  2001ay , 2005eq , and 2009dc are illustrated in figure [ bv_comp ] .",
    "for the first three weeks after maximum light sne  2001ay and 2009dc were remarkably similar , but at @xmath3740  d the light curves diverge . as the peak - to - tail ratio in the @xmath1- and @xmath31-band light curves sheds light on the central density and progenitor mass of single - degenerate explosions @xcite , a comparison of the observational features and modeling of very slow decliners may yield similar insights .    in figure [ 01ay_bv ]",
    "we show the unreddened @xmath38 colors of sn  2001ay , the unreddened locus of @xcite and @xcite , and the  = 0.83 mag locus of @xcite . on the basis of some of the spectra published here , @xcite classified sn  2001ay as a `` broad - line '' type ia sn .",
    "this is the subtype that @xcite suggest is intrinsically redder than normal type ia sne , or occurs in dustier environments , with @xmath39 .",

    "adopting @xmath120 instead could cut these down by a factor of three .",

    "sne  2001ay and 2009dc have almost the same optical decline rate .",
    "sn  2001ay had normal optical peak brightness and high si  ii velocity .",
    "sn  2009dc was overluminous at optical maximum and had much lower si  ii velocity .",
    "their @xmath26-band light curves are unlike those of any other type ia sne observed thus far , except for sn  1999aw .",
    "to investigate the details of our sn spectra , we use the sn spectrum - synthesis code synow @xcite .",
    "although synow has a simple , parametric approach to creating synthetic spectra , it is a powerful tool to aid line identifications which in turn provide insights into the spectral formation of the objects . to generate a synthetic spectrum one inputs a blackbody temperature ( @xmath123 ) , a photospheric velocity ( @xmath124 ) , and for each involved ion , an optical depth at a reference line , an excitation temperature ( @xmath125 ) , and the maximum velocity of the opacity distribution ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "moreover , it assumes that the optical depth declines exponentially for velocities above @xmath124 with an @xmath101-folding scale of @xmath127 .",
    "the strengths of the lines for each ion are determined by oscillator strengths , and the approximation of a boltzmann distribution of the lower level populations is set by the temperature @xmath125 .    in figure [ synow1 ]",
    ", we present our @xmath128  d spectrum of sn  2001ay with a synthetic spectrum generated from synow .",
    "this fit has @xmath129 = 20,500  k and @xmath130  km  s@xmath43 .",
    "the majority of the observed features are well fit by the synthetic spectrum .",
    "the ions used in the fit , as labeled in the figure , are commonly observed in the near - maximum spectra of type ia sne @xcite with the exception of c  ii .",
    "although the inclusion of c  ii in the fit produces an absorption feature at @xmath131    ( due to c  ii @xmath526580 ) that is too strong compared to the observed spectrum , it nonetheless yields a better fit to the absorption feature at @xmath132    ( due to c  ii @xmath524745 ) , so we conclude that the inclusion of c  ii marginally improves the synow fit .",
    "we attempt synow fits to the sn 2001ay spectra at @xmath133  d and 23  d. figure [ synow2 ] shows the result for the @xmath133  d spectrum .",
    "the model spectrum has @xmath123 = 14,000  k and @xmath134 = 11,000  km  s@xmath43 , and has all the regular ions observed in a type ia sn .",
    "c  ii is no longer needed , but a relatively strong na  i line is now observed at @xmath135   . a synow fit for the @xmath136  d spectrum ( not shown ) requires @xmath137  k and @xmath138  km  s@xmath43 .",
    "finally , in figure [ synapps ] we show a model fit to our keck spectrum using the synapps code of @xcite .",
    "the physical assumptions synapps uses match those of synow @xcite , so findings are restricted to identification of features and not quantitative abundances .",
    "but where synow is completely interactive , synapps is automated .",
    "this relieves the user from iterative adjustment of a large number of parameters ( over 50 variables ) to gain fit agreement and assures more exhaustive searching of the parameter space .",
    "synapps can be thought of as the hybridization of a synow - like calculation with a parallel optimization framework , where spectral fit quality serves as the objective function to optimize .",
    "a good fit constrains explosion models through interpretive spectral feature identification , with the main result being the detection or exclusion of specific chemical elements .",
    "the velocity distribution of detected species within the ejecta can also be constrained .",
    "synapps indicates that sn  2001ay had a photospheric velocity of 10,800  at @xmath41 d , which should be robust , as it is derived from 11 ions , namely c  ii , o  i , mg  ii , si  ii , si  iii , s  ii , ca  ii , fe  ii , fe  iii , co  ii , and ni  ii .",
    "we are confident of the presence of c  ii .",
    "we have presented the available spectra , as well as optical and near - ir photometry , of sn  2001ay .    while sn  2001ay is the most slowly declining type ia sn ever discovered , it was not overluminous in optical bandpasses . in near - ir bands it was overluminous only at the 2@xmath5 level at most . unlike other very slow decliners such as sne 2003fg , 2007if , and 2009dc ,",
    "which were significantly overluminous , we do not have any evidence that sn  2001ay was a super - chandrasekhar - mass explosion .",
    "sn  2001ay showed evidence for c  ii , but it was much weaker than in sn  2009dc . at early times",
    "mg  ii and si  ii were observed in sn   2001ay at high velocity ( 14,000  and higher ) . by contrast , spectra of sn 2009dc did not show large velocities for mg  ii and si  ii . on the basis of a small number of super - chandrasekhar - mass candidates",
    ", it seems that these objects exhibit rather low velocities , possibly the result of retardation due to a shell of material arising from the disruption of the less massive white dwarf in a double - degenerate system .",
    "sn  2001ay produced ( 0.58 @xmath0 0.15)/@xmath7 m@xmath8 of @xmath6ni , considerably less than a chandrasekhar mass .",
    "the value of @xmath7 probably lies in the range 1.0 to 1.2 .",
    "naively , one might conclude that sn  2001ay was a single - degenerate explosion , but this is hardly a firm conclusion .",

    "<S> sn  2001ay had @xmath3 and @xmath4 mag at maximum light ; thus , it was _ not _ overluminous in optical bands . in near - infrared bands it was overluminous only at the 2@xmath5 level at most . for a rise time of 18  d ( explosion to bolometric maximum ) </S>",

    "<S> the `` normal '' @xmath6ni yield and the typical peak optical brightness suggest that the very broad optical light curve is explained by the trapping of the @xmath10 rays in the inner regions . </S>"
