    "in this work , we consider the initial value problem for the nonlinear schrdinger equation in two spatial dimensions @xmath8 this classical equation has been studied intensively for the past fifty years and many problems regarding local well - posedness , global existence , blowup and asymptotic behaviour have very complete answers ( see the monographs @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the most standard framework where one studies this initial value problem is based on the following @xmath6 local well - posedness result : for any @xmath9 , there exists a unique maximal solution @xmath10 of , which depends continuously on the initial data .",
    "moreover , if @xmath11 , one has @xmath12 as @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath6 framework allows one to used certain conserved quantities ( mass , energy , variance , etc . ) to obtain precise results on the dynamical behaviour of solutions .",
    "apart from this , few nonstandard frameworks have been developed ( see , for example , @xcite , for a theory on zhidkov spaces ) .    here",
    ", we shall introduce new functional spaces and study local well - posedness , global existence and stability ( in a way that will be clear further ahead ) .",
    "these spaces do not lie within @xmath5 : in fact , the first one will lie in @xmath14 , but not in @xmath15 , for any @xmath16 ; the second will lie in @xmath17 , but not in @xmath15 , @xmath18 .",
    "the most simple example of these spaces appeared for the first time in a previous work , @xcite , in the context of the hyperbolic nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "we shall generalize the results of @xcite in the context of the ( nls ) for two reasons : to our knowledge , there are no results of this type for ( nls ) ; secondly , even though one may prove similar results for more general equations , that would increase needlessly the complexity of the exposition and deviate the attention of the reader from the essential ideas .",
    "the first step is to take any @xmath19 and consider solutions of ( nls ) of the form @xmath20 ( we call these solutions _ spatial plane waves _ : the number @xmath21 is the _ speed _ and the function @xmath22 is the _ profile _ of the wave ) . introducing this ansatz ,",
    "one arrives to @xmath23 which one may solve using the standard @xmath6 theory .",
    "it is clear that spatial plane waves are not @xmath24 solutions of ( nls ) , for any @xmath16 , even though they lie in @xmath25 .",
    "based on these solutions , consider the space of spatial plane waves @xmath26 then the initial value problem for ( nls ) is well - posed over @xmath27 , simply because the problem reduces to the local theory in one spatial dimension .",
    "now consider @xmath28 notice that , due to the lack of decay of elements in @xmath27 , the sum is indeed a direct sum .",
    "then the initial value problem for @xmath29 can be proven to be equivalent to the initial value problem for the system @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the profile of @xmath32 .",
    "notice that the second equation is independent on @xmath33 .",
    "this means that one may solve it and introduce the solution onto the first equation .",
    "thus , to prove local well - posedness on @xmath34 , it suffices to show an @xmath6 local well - posedness result for the first equation .",
    "this is achieved by making the crucial observation that the nonlinear terms lie in @xmath35 ( even though they involve @xmath36 ) .",
    "with such a local well - posedness result , consider the following situation : take a spatial plane wave @xmath36 with initial data @xmath32 , and assume @xmath36 is globally defined . if one introduces an @xmath6 perturbation on the initial data , @xmath37 , the corresponding solution is given by @xmath38 ( since @xmath36 only depends on the plane wave part of the initial data ) .",
    "then a natural question is the following :    _ stability problem : if @xmath39 is sufficiently small , does @xmath40 stay close to @xmath36 ? _",
    "this question corresponds to a global existence result for @xmath33 that insures that @xmath33 stays small for all times .",
    "results of such nature are indeed valid for ( nls ) in @xmath6 ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) in the @xmath7-supercritical case . here , however , the question is not that clear : first , if one develops the nonlinear terms in the equation for @xmath33 , one sees that lower order terms in @xmath33 are present ; second , the plane wave component @xmath36 , which even has `` infinite mass '' and `` infinite energy '' ( due to the lack of integrability ) might act as a forcing term , pushing @xmath33 to grow indefinitely . in @xcite ,",
    "such a result was proven for @xmath41 an even power greater or equal to 4 , in the context of the hyperbolic nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "now we advance to the next level of complexity .",
    "take a sequence of wave speeds @xmath42 , with @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and consider the space @xmath45 endowed with the induced norm ( which , as we will check , is well - defined ) . as before ,",
    "we look for a local well - posedness result in @xmath46 which turns out to be equivalent to a local well - posedness result for the infinite system @xmath47 the equations for the profiles @xmath48 are solved using the @xmath49 local well - posedness result ( here , one must be careful to ensure that _ all _ profiles exist up to some time @xmath50 ) . once again , it remains to prove that one may solve the equation for @xmath33 in @xmath4 , which amounts to check that the nonlinear terms are in @xmath51 . under the additional hypothesis @xmath52 ,",
    "this can be shown to be true : heuristically , if one develops the nonlinear terms , one obtains some terms with @xmath33 , which are well - behaved , and some products of diferent @xmath53 s .",
    "remarkably , these terms lie in @xmath5 : take , for example , @xmath54 , @xmath55 . then @xmath56 however , since one has an infinite sum of such terms , one must be able to control @xmath57 the above quantity turns out to be preserved by the flow of the infinite system , since one has conservation of the @xmath7 norm of each @xmath48 , and therefore it can controlled by the initial data . hence we shall restrict ourselves to @xmath58 one finally concludes that it is possible to solve the equation for @xmath33 and arrives to the local well - posedness result over @xmath59 :    [ existnumeravel ] fix @xmath52 and @xmath60 .",
    "then there exists a unique maximal solution @xmath61 ( cf . ) of ( nls ) such that @xmath62 .",
    "the solution depends continuously of @xmath63 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath64 , then @xmath65    as in the single plane wave case , the stability problem may be studied . here , we present the following result :    [ estabilidadenumeravel ] set @xmath66 even . given @xmath67",
    ", there exist @xmath68 and @xmath69 , with @xmath70 as @xmath71 , such that , if @xmath72 and @xmath73 satisfy @xmath74 @xmath75 then the solutions of ( nls ) @xmath40 and @xmath76 with initial data @xmath77 and @xmath32 , respectively , are both globally defined and satisfy @xmath78    we now arrive to the last generalization , more complex and with interesting properties .",
    "the idea is simply to pass from a discrete sum of plane waves to an _ integration over a continuum of plane waves_. that is , we consider @xmath79 endowed with the norm @xmath80 .",
    "one may actually define an integral transform , the _ plane wave transform _ , mapping functions in two _ speed _ variables to functions in two _ physical _ variables @xmath81 before we study the initial value problem for ( nls ) in this context , we shall study some very interesting properties related to the plane wave transform . among them , one may prove that :    * @xmath82 , @xmath83 under suitable conditions on @xmath22 ( proposition [ integrabilidadelp ] and corollary [ integrabilidadel2 ] ) ; * @xmath84 if @xmath85 is positive ( corollary [ naointegrabilidadel2 ] ) ; * the convolution of two functions , the fourier transform and the laplace transform may be obtained using the plane wave transform transform ( corollary [ convolucao ] and examples [ calor ] and [ schrodinger ] ) ; * several classical linear equations , such as the heat equation , the schrdinger equation and the wave equation , may be solved by means of this transform ( section [ resolverequacoes ] ) .",
    "one should regard all the previous definitions in analogy to the fourier series and transform : one starts with a simple periodic function with a given frequency , superposes a numerable family of functions with different frequencies to arrive to the fourier series and passes to the continuous case to obtain the fourier transform , where one also has the concepts of physical and frequency variables .    evidently , our construction is not the same as the fourier one and many properties will differ .",
    "one aspect is that , while the fourier construction makes all sense in one variable ( and its multidimensional version is simply the application of the one - dimensional case to each variable ) , the plane wave construction needs ( at least ) a two - dimensional setting . in another perspective",
    ", the fourier transform is based on the solutions of the ode @xmath86 while the plane wave theory is based on solutions of the transport equation @xmath87    with this new transform in hand , we try to obtain some results in the spirit of the numerable case .",
    "that is , look for local well - posedness and stability results in @xmath88 .",
    "the main difference is that now the ( nls ) may be decoupled into @xmath89 surprisingly , when one passes to the continuous case , there exists a decoupling such that the equation for the plane wave component is linear .",
    "we now state our main results .",
    "[ existenciacontinuo ] fix @xmath52 and @xmath90 .",
    "then there exists a unique maximal solution @xmath91 of ( nls ) ( cf . definition [ defisolucao ] ) such that @xmath62 .",
    "the solution depends continuously on the initial data .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath64 , then @xmath92    [ estabilidadecontinuo ] set @xmath93 even .",

    "moreover , if @xmath99 is the free schrdinger group in dimension two , @xmath100    as a consequence of theorem [ estabilidadecontinuo ] , we have    [ grandesdados ] set @xmath93 even .",

    ". therefore the energy of these solutions will always be positive and so there is no possible contradiction with the usual virial blowup result by glassey @xcite .",
