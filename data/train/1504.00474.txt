    "developing efficient methods to prevent epidemic outbreaks or accelerate information dissemination is the ultimate goal of research on spreading dynamics across various domains @xcite . for diseases and information that spread through social networks",
    ", the structure of underlying contact network can greatly affect the spreading processes @xcite .",
    "previous studies have inspected the role of topology in epidemic threshold and critical behavior .",
    "for example , in uncorrelated networks , the epidemic threshold is @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the first and second moments of the degree distribution @xcite .",
    "later on , in view of the wide occurrence of intrinsic heterogeneous complex networks in real world , researchers started to investigate the effect of microstructure on spreading dynamics in more detailed perspectives : the community structure appearing in social networks @xcite , @xmath0-shell decomposition of networks for identification of influential spreaders @xcite , link salience skeleton correlated with the frequency of a link s appearance in infection hierarchies @xcite , as well as weak ties which is significant for information dissemination @xcite .    due to the existence of complex microstructure , individuals with different topological features should play distinct roles during the spreading processes .",
    "previous studies mainly focus on the spreading ability of individuals .",
    "many topological measures are employed to identify influential spreaders in networks , such as degree @xcite , betweenness @xcite , @xmath0-shell index @xcite , pagerank @xcite , etc .",
    "in fact , individuals situated in different positions of the contact network will also vary in susceptibility to epidemics . identifying the highly susceptible individuals in contact networks",
    "is of great significance in controlling epidemic outbreaks .",
    "therefore , it is indispensable to explore the factors that affect people s susceptibility .    in this paper",
    ", we study the susceptibility of individuals in sir and rumor spreading dynamics through extensive simulations in real - world social networks .",
    "first , we explore the impact of community structure on people s susceptibility .",
    "even though the community structure can diminish the infected population and slow down the spreading processes , it is not the pivotal factor affecting nodes susceptibility .",
    "although the location of epidemic source has an impact on the precise infected probability of each single person , there exist a group of nodes that can always get infected with relatively high probabilities no matter where the spreading originates .",
    "we are particularly interested in these populations and consider them as highly susceptible individuals . to quantitatively depict the property of these people , we define the susceptibility of each individual as the average probability to be infected by a randomly chosen spreading source",
    ". then we further explore the topological properties of the highly susceptibility individuals . by examining their topological traits including degree , @xmath0-shell , betweenness centrality and pagerank",
    ", we find the susceptibility of individuals is sensitive to the choice of spreading dynamics . for sir spreading",
    ", the susceptibility is highly correlated to nodes influence .",
    "therefore , nodes located in the core region of networks are more likely to be infected . however , in rumor spreading model , degree can better identify highly susceptible individuals .",
    "our results indicate that it is necessary to acquire the information of spreading mechanism to better locate highly susceptible population in practice .",
    "most of social networks in reality have notable community structure .",
    "we first explore the impact of community structure on individuals probabilities to be infected in spreading processes .",
    "we examine the epidemic flows in two social networks with community structure : ( 1 ) the friendship network between users of the social network facebook ( facebook ) @xcite , ( 2 ) the enron email communication network ( enron ) , in which nodes are email addresses and edges represent email communications @xcite .",
    "these social networks have been used in previous studies .",

    "the solid black dots represent outbreak origins .",
    "the infected probability is obtained by averaging over @xmath11 sir realizations .",
    "the colors indicate the logarithmic values ( base 10 ) of infected probability for corresponding individuals . ]",
    "the community structure is extracted by a fast heuristic method based on modularity optimization @xcite .",
    "the layout of community structure for facebook social network is shown with different colors in fig . [",
    "fig1](a ) . to simulate spreading processes among populations , we first apply susceptible - infectious - recovered ( sir ) @xcite model on the above social networks . in sir model",
    ", the population can be classified into three possible states : susceptible ( s ) , infected ( i ) , or recovered ( r ) .",
    "starting from a single epidemic source node , at each time step , the infected individuals ( i ) would infect their susceptible neighbors ( s ) with probability @xmath9 and then become recovered ( r ) and gain permanent immunity with probability @xmath12 .",
    "such process continues until there are no infected individuals in the system . in our simulations , without loss of generality , we set @xmath13 .",
    "previous studies have adopted this model to describe diffusion of contagious diseases . for information dissemination ,",
    "recent works have shown that , although some information spreading processes are greatly affected by human - related factors @xcite , a few information memes showing viral behavior can also spread like infectious diseases @xcite .",
    "hence the sir model is applicable not only to epidemics but also to those information memes which are not seriously affected by human - related factors .    in simulations ,",
    "the selection of infection rate @xmath9 could significantly affect the spreading outcomes .",
    "below the critical value @xmath14 , the proportion of infected individuals will vanish in the limit of a very large population . for @xmath9",
    "much larger than @xmath7 , the epidemic will infect almost all the people in the network . in our study , we use relatively small values of @xmath9 to guarantee medium scale infection coverage .",
    "otherwise most of the nodes will be infected with high probabilities , making their susceptibility indistinguishable . in table [ tb ] , we report the critical infection rate @xmath7 and adopted value @xmath9 in our simulations .",
    "the infection rate @xmath9 is slightly above its corresponding critical value @xmath7 to generate moderate coverage .    for facebook network ,",
    "we select three nodes in different communities as spreading sources and apply @xmath11 realizations of sir model .",
    "the infected probability of each individual is approximated by the frequency of getting infected in these realizations . in fig.[fig1](b - d ) , we display the distribution of infected probability for facebook social network .",
    "the black dots represent outbreak origins and the infected probability is indicated by colors .",
    "clearly , the epidemic permeates to several communities .",
    "moreover , during all the epidemic spreading , there exist a group of individuals retaining relatively high infected probabilities , regardless of the positions of spreading sources .    .",
    "the evolution of infected proportion @xmath15 is displayed in ( a ) . in ( b ) , we present the infected proportion @xmath15 versus time @xmath16 for rumor spreading model with @xmath17 . ]    in order to check the effect of community structure on spreading processes , we compare the evolution of infected proportion @xmath15 in networks with and without community structure . for facebook network ,",
    "we rewire the links to destroy the community structure . specifically , we randomly select two links @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and then swap the end nodes to @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this procedure breaks down the communities but preserves the degree distribution . in our simulations",
    ", we perform @xmath22 rewire operations .",
    "the result of sir model is shown in fig.[fig2](a ) . under same conditions ,",
    "the rewired facebook network has a much higher infected proportion , which implies the community structure restricts the spreading processes to some extent .",
    "meanwhile , it will take a longer time for facebook network with community structure to achieve a given infected proportion @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , the community structure will slow down the speed of sir spreading .    to examine whether our finding is applicable to other spreading dynamics , we perform the same analysis on rumor spreading model @xcite . in rumor spreading model , each individual can be in three possible states : the spreader ( s ) , ignorant ( i ) , and stifler ( r ) .",
    "spreaders represent nodes that are aware of the rumor and are willing to transmit it .",
    "ignorant people are individuals unaware of the rumor .",
    "stiflers stand for those that already know the rumor but are not willing to spread it anymore . in each time step",
    ", the spreaders contact one of their neighbors randomly and turn the ignorant ones into spreaders with probability @xmath10 .",
    "if the spreaders encounter spreaders or stiflers , they will turn to stiflers with probability @xmath12 .",
    "we also set @xmath13 in our simulations .",
    "we obtain similar results in fig.[fig2](b ) .",
    "during spreading processes , the exact values of infected probability depends on the choice of spreading sources .",
    "but in real - world applications , usually we have no information about the locations of spreading origins , which makes it impractical and intractable to obtain individuals exact infected probability during an epidemic outbreak . in spite of that , there exist a group of nodes exhibiting relatively high infected probability regardless of the position of source ( see fig.[fig1](b - d ) ) . in our work",
    ", we will focus on these persons who would be infected easily from a randomly chosen spreading origin .",
    "we define the source - independent susceptibility @xmath23 of a given individual @xmath24 as the average infected probability over epidemics starting from all the nodes in the network : @xmath25 where @xmath4 is the number of nodes in the network , and @xmath26 is the number of spreading realizations originating from each node . in our research , we set @xmath27 . besides , @xmath28 denotes whether node @xmath24 gets infected ( @xmath29 ) or not ( @xmath30 ) during the @xmath31 spreading realization originating from node @xmath32 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath33 represents the average infected probability of node @xmath24 during the spreading from node @xmath32 .",
    "we should note that this definition of susceptibility is different from that in @xcite , where the susceptibility is defined as the nature of individuals , such as immune system , physical condition or learning ability , etc . according to our definition , on average , nodes with higher susceptibility",
    "@xmath23 are more likely to be infected during an epidemic wherever the contagion starts .    for sir spreading model",
    ", we can calculate the susceptibility with the standard set of equations of sir dynamics . for a network with @xmath4 nodes ,",
    "the topology is recorded by the adjacency matrix @xmath34 , where @xmath35 if node @xmath24 and @xmath32 are connected , and @xmath36 otherwise .",
    "we denote the probability of node @xmath24 being in susceptible , infected and recovered state at time @xmath16 as @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively . for networks without too many short loops , we assume the neighbors of one node can independently get infected at time @xmath16 .",
    "then the evolution of dynamics follows @xmath40 , \\\\",
    "\\frac{dp_{i}^i(t)}{dt}&=&[1-\\prod_{j=1}^n(1-\\beta_s a_{ij}p_{j}^i(t)p_{i}^s(t))]-p_{i}^i(t ) , \\\\    \\frac{dp_{i}^r(t)}{dt}&=&p_{i}^i(t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath41 is the element of adjacency matrix @xmath42 . in case of small infection rate @xmath9 , the term @xmath43 $ ]",
    "can be approximated by @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , there are only two independent equations since @xmath45 .",
    "we discretize the above equations and obtain two independent ones @xmath46    for simplicity , the above equations can be transformed into a matrix form . denote @xmath47 as the vector @xmath48 , @xmath49 as the vector @xmath50 , and @xmath51 as the diagonal matrix @xmath52 .",
    "then we have @xmath53 therefore , we obtain the evolution functions for @xmath47 and @xmath49 . since we select the spreading source randomly , the initial condition is @xmath54 and @xmath55 . the susceptibility vector @xmath56 . here",
    "@xmath57 indicates the spreading dynamic evolves for a long enough period of time so that no infected individuals are left in the system . in case of sparse networks",
    ", the iteration converges very quickly .",
    "therefore the susceptibility can be calculated by this method efficiently .    ,",
    "@xmath58 ) , the simulation values of @xmath23 and theoretical predictions @xmath59 are displayed in ( a ) ( @xmath60 ) and ( b ) ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the slope of simulation values versus theoretical predictions for different @xmath9 is shown in ( c ) .",
    "the inset presents their correlation coefficient . in ( d ) , we show the residual error of theoretical predictions for various @xmath9 . ]",
    "we verify the calculation on erds - rnyi ( er ) random networks .",
    "we construct the er random network with size @xmath62 and average degree @xmath58 by randomly assigning @xmath63 links among @xmath64 nodes .",
    "then we perform sir simulations to obtain simulated susceptibility @xmath23 and calculate the theoretical value @xmath59 through iterations . for @xmath60 ,",
    "the theoretical values agree well with the simulation results ( see fig.[fig3](a ) ) .",
    "however , for @xmath61 , which is above the threshold value @xmath65 , theoretical values are considerably larger than simulation values ( see fig.[fig3](b ) ) .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained by the invalidation of assumptions . for a relatively large infection rate @xmath9",
    ", the epidemic would occupy a macroscopic fraction of population . under this condition ,",
    "the assumption that a node s neighbors are infected independently becomes invalid .",
    "therefore , the exact probability of a node @xmath24 to be infected by its neighbors at time @xmath16 should be smaller than @xmath44 , which implies our method overestimates nodes susceptibility . even though the calculation has the problem of overestimation , the theoretical predictions and simulation values follow a straight line .",
    "we fit this line to @xmath66 for different @xmath67 $ ] and examine the correlation coefficient between @xmath23 and @xmath59 in the inset of fig.[fig3](c ) .",
    "it can be seen that theoretical predictions are highly correlated with simulated susceptibility .",
    "however , the slope @xmath0 varies as @xmath9 increases . for @xmath68 ,",
    "the slope @xmath0 remains around @xmath69 , which means theoretical values are quite accurate . as @xmath9 approaching to @xmath65 , the slope @xmath0 decreases dramatically .",
    "this implies @xmath59 becomes larger than @xmath23 , even though they still have a linear relationship .",
    "this phenomenon is also reflected in fig.[fig3](d ) , in which we display the residual error @xmath70 for different @xmath9 . with @xmath9 increasing to @xmath7 , the residual error @xmath71 rises abruptly .",
    "therefore , our method predicts susceptibility accurately for infection rate @xmath9 smaller than threshold value @xmath7 , and can be used to rank susceptibility for @xmath9 near or larger than @xmath7 .",
    "although we have calculated the susceptibility with the standard set of equations of spreading dynamics , it is still convenient to discern highly susceptible individuals with topological indicators in practice . here",
    "we explore some of the most important topological measures in network theory .",
    "the most straightforward and simple one is degree @xmath0 , i.e. the number of connections a node maintains .",
    "hubs ( high degree nodes ) are believed to play significant roles in many dynamical processes .",
    "more connections may lead to a higher chance to be infected in an epidemic spreading .",
    "however , degree only reflects nodes number of neighbors . in order to check people s global location in networks",
    ", we also examine the @xmath0-shell index @xmath72 by @xmath0-shell decomposition analysis @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-shell decomposition can be described as follows : firstly we start by recursively removing nodes with degree @xmath73 until there are only nodes with degree @xmath74 left in the network .",
    "all the nodes removed in this procedure are assigned with @xmath75 . in a similar way",
    ", we iteratively find out higher @xmath0-shells until all nodes are pruned . in this procedure , each node will be assigned a unique @xmath0-shell index @xmath72 .",
    "nodes belonging to high ( low ) @xmath0-shells are located in the core ( periphery ) area of the network .",
    "another topological measure , betweenness centrality , quantifies the number of shortest paths passing through each node . in social science ,",
    "the betweenness centrality of node @xmath24 , denoted by @xmath76 is defined as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the number of shortest paths between nodes @xmath79 and @xmath16 , and @xmath80 is the number of shortest paths between @xmath79 and @xmath16 which pass through node @xmath24 .",
    "consequently , nodes with large betweenness centrality usually hold the vital positions in the shortest pathways between large numbers of nodes pairs .",
    "in addition , considering the importance of nodes neighbors , pagerank , which is originally introduced to rank web pages , is proposed @xcite .",
    "the pagerank of a node @xmath24 in a network can be calculated from @xmath81 where @xmath41 is the element of adjacency matrix @xmath42 and @xmath82 is the jumping probability . in our calculation , as in many previous studies , we set @xmath83 conventionally . to sum up ,",
    "we have chosen four typical topological measures proposed from different perspectives : degree @xmath0 , @xmath0-shell @xmath72 , betweenness centrality @xmath84 and pagerank .     and degree @xmath0 ( a , d , g ) , betweenness centrality @xmath84 ( b , e , h ) and pagerank ( c , f , i ) respectively .",
    "the infection rate @xmath9 is @xmath85 and @xmath86 for facebook and enron networks .",
    "values are indicated by colors , which are shown in color bars . ]    first , we compare the performance of @xmath0-shell and degree for sir model . for individuals with a given combination of @xmath0-shell and degree @xmath87 , we check the average susceptibility @xmath88 : @xmath89 here @xmath90 is the collection of all nodes with @xmath0-shell and degree @xmath87 , and @xmath91 is the number of nodes in the set @xmath90 . the susceptibility @xmath23 of node @xmath24 is calculated by averaging over @xmath64 sir realizations in each social network .",
    "we display the logarithmic value ( base 10 ) of @xmath88 in fig.[fig4](a ) , ( d ) , ( g ) and ( j ) for facebook , enron , rewired facebook and rewired enron social networks respectively .",
    "it is observed that most highly susceptible individuals occupy high @xmath0-shells . for nodes with a fixed degree @xmath0",
    ", the susceptibility can be either large or small , depending on their @xmath0-shell values .",
    "meanwhile , the individuals located in the same @xmath72 shell have similar susceptibility .",
    "this implies , @xmath0-shell index could better reflect nodes susceptibility than degree @xmath0 .",
    "we also perform same analyses for betweenness centrality @xmath84 ( see fig.[fig4](b),(e),(h),(k ) ) and pagerank ( see fig.[fig4](c),(f),(i),(l ) ) .",
    "consistently , @xmath0-shell index @xmath72 outperforms betweenness centrality and pagerank in predicting the average susceptibility of individuals .",
    "we should also note that our results are not affected by the community structure .",
    "we compare our results in the original and rewired networks in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "the conclusion is not sensitive to the existence of community structure .",
    "no matter where the node locates in the network ( between communities or within communities ) , it is susceptible to sir spreading processes as long as it has a high @xmath0-shell index .     for different fraction @xmath92 in sir model",
    ". for facebook ( a ) , enron ( b ) , rewired facebook ( c ) and rewired enron ( d ) social networks , we display the recognition rate curves @xmath93 for k - shell @xmath72 , degree @xmath0 , betweenness centrality @xmath84 and pagerank .",
    "the fraction @xmath92 ranges from 0.05 to 0.5 .",
    "the infection rate @xmath9 in sir simulations is @xmath85 and @xmath86 for facebook and enron networks . ]",
    "although @xmath0-shell can better predict the average susceptibility of individuals , since the susceptibility for nodes with same topological measures has fluctuations , it is still desirable to explore their accuracy in locating highly susceptible persons . to this end , we use the recognition rate @xmath93 to quantify the efficiency in identifying individuals of high susceptibility @xcite .",
    "the recognition rate @xmath93 is defined as @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the sets of nodes ranking in top @xmath92 percentage by susceptibility and topological measures , and @xmath97 is the number of elements in the set .",
    "in fact , recognition rate @xmath93 indicates the proportion of highly susceptible individuals which can be predicted by each measure .",
    "the higher @xmath93 is , the more accurate the predictor is . in fig.[fig5 ] , we display the recognition rate @xmath93 ( @xmath98 $ ] ) for facebook , enron , rewired facebook and rewired enron networks . in most cases , @xmath0-shell index @xmath72 and degree",
    "@xmath0 outperform betweenness centrality @xmath84 and pagerank .",
    "and @xmath72 performs better than degree @xmath0 in general , except when the fraction @xmath92 is relatively small for facebook and rewired facebook networks .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that in these networks , nodes with extremely large degree tend to locate in the core region .",
    "therefore , if we pick high - degree nodes , they will also have high @xmath72 .",
    "however , the number of such hubs is not too large .",
    "as we increase the fraction @xmath92 , @xmath72 could still identify more highly susceptible individuals .",
    "this phenomenon depends on the exact topological structure of networks .",
    "for instance , for tree - like networks , @xmath72 only contains a few values . under this condition ,",
    "degree @xmath0 can clearly better distinguish highly susceptible individuals .",
    "whereas , such simple topological structure usually does not appear in large scale real - world social networks . on the contrary , realistic social networks posses rather complex structure , in which hubs are not necessarily located in the dense core .",
    "so in real scenario , @xmath72 is still an effective predictor for highly susceptible individuals .     and influence @xmath99 of sir model",
    "is presented in ( a ) .",
    "the infection rate @xmath9 is set to be @xmath85 .",
    "we also display susceptibility @xmath100 versus influence @xmath99 of rumor spreading model in ( b ) .",
    "@xmath10 is set to be @xmath101 . ]    as pointed out in the supporting information of ref.@xcite , for sir model , nodes influence and infected probability are highly correlated .",
    "we present the relationship between susceptibility @xmath100 and influence @xmath99 of sir model in fig.[fig6](a ) .",
    "influence @xmath102 is defined as the average size of the population infected in a spreading process originating at node @xmath24 .",
    "since @xmath0-shell outperforms other topological measures in identifying influential spreaders for sir model @xcite , it should be also effective in locating highly susceptible individuals .",
    "this explains the efficacy of @xmath0-shell for sir model .",
    "in fact , for any independent - interaction spreading models in which susceptibility and influence are closely correlated , such as sir and sis model , @xmath0-shell should be a good topological indicator for highly susceptible people .",
    "however , for rumor spreading model , we find the susceptibility and influence have no clear correlation , as shown in fig.[fig6](b ) . in rumor spreading model ,",
    "influential spreaders are not necessarily highly susceptible to spreading processes .",
    "it has been found that @xmath0-shell can not represent nodes spreading capability in rumor spreading model @xcite . then it is desirable to find the topological indicator of susceptibility in rumor spreading model .",
    "since the figure like fig.[fig4 ] can not distinguish the performance of some measures clearly , we directly display the recognition rate for each topological indicator in fig.[fig7 ] .",
    "for all considered networks , degree is capable of recognizing more high - risk people , which differs from the better performance of @xmath0-shell for sir model .",
    "also , the community structure will not affect the prominent performance of degree .",
    "whereas , after rewiring links , the recognition rates for all indicators are enhanced .",
    "this implies the existence of community structure undermines the effectiveness of topological indicators .     for different fraction @xmath92 in rumor spreading model",
    ". for facebook ( a ) , enron ( b ) , rewired facebook ( c ) and rewired enron ( d ) social networks , we display the recognition rate curves @xmath93 for k - shell @xmath72 , degree @xmath0 , betweenness centrality @xmath84 and pagerank .",
    "the fraction @xmath92 ranges from 0.05 to 0.5 .",
    "the infection rate @xmath10 in rumor spreading simulations is @xmath101 for all networks . ]    in fact , the different results obtained in sir model and rumor spreading model can be explained by the spreading mechanisms . in sir model ,",
    "the superior performance of @xmath0-shell relies on the cascading behavior of spreading processes .",
    "starting from the source , the epidemic will diffuse from person to person contagiously and may eventually spread through the majority of population in a `` viral '' way .",
    "usually , a spreading process will last for many generations before it dies out . for nodes located in the core region , not only their neighbors are prone to be infected , but also their neighbors of neighbors have large chances to be infected , and so forth . consequently , @xmath0-shell can better describe nodes susceptibility in sir model . on the contrary , in rumor spreading model , once a spreader encounters a spreader or stifler neighbor , it will stop spreading the information .",
    "this dramatically restrains the cascading behavior .",
    "it has been found that nodes with high @xmath0-shell values serve as `` firewalls '' of rumor spreading @xcite , i.e. , once these nodes are infected , they will soon turn into stiflers . under this situation , high @xmath0-shell nodes will have lower chances to be infected due to their `` firewall '' neighbors . since the cascading behavior is restricted , it is sufficient to consider only one - step neighbors",
    ". therefore , degree outperforms @xmath0-shell in rumor spreading model .",
    "in this paper , we investigate individual s susceptibility in spreading processes .",
    "we first study the impact of community structure on people s susceptibility . we find that , although the community structure can reduce the infected population and slow down the spreading processes",
    ", it will not affect nodes susceptibility significantly .",
    "for sir model , we find the topological indicator @xmath0-shell can better identify highly susceptible individuals , outperforming degree , betweenness centrality and pagerank .",
    "this can be explained by the high correlation between nodes susceptibility and influence . on the contrary , for rumor spreading model , nodes susceptibility and influence have no clear correlation .",
    "degree performs the best among considered topological measures .",
    "we give an explanation of the different results of sir and rumor spreading models based on spreading mechanisms .",
    "in general , for spreading processes that can trigger large - scale cascading behaviors , such as sir model , nodes in the core region should be more susceptible since they tend to have highly susceptible neighbors , neighbors of neighbors , and so forth .",
    "in contrast , in spreading models that rely on short - range diffusion , degree should be a good choice of indicator for susceptibility .",
