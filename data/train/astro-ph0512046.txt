    "the rotation curve , describing the circular speed of rotating material as a function of galactocentric radius , is a fundamental tool for the study of the kinematics of our galaxy .",
    "it is best derived , because of interstellar extinction , from observations of atomic and molecular gas in radio and mm wavelengths .",
    "the derivation involves determining the _ terminal velocity _ , or maximum absolute radial velocity relative to the sun , toward lines of sight that sample the galaxy within the solar circle ( quadrants i and iv ) .",
    "such terminal velocities correspond , assuming pure circular motion , to the tangent points to circumferences around the galactic center , named _",
    "subcentral points_. these points subtend a circumference that connects the solar position with the galactic center",
    ". a detailed analysis of the rotation curve can reveal important physical characteristics of the rotating material , such as the amount of shear and vorticity at each galactocentric radius .",
    "these physical quantities regulate the gravitational stability of a differentially rotating gaseous disk and , consequently , the large scale distribution and properties of star formation in the galactic disk .    the first derivation of the rotation curve for the iv galactic quadrant that made use of the co(j=1@xmath00 ) line - the best tracer of molecular hydrogen in the interstellar medium - was presented by alvarez , may , & bronfman ( 1990 ) .",
    "the spectral data used to determine the terminal velocities were taken from the columbia - u. de chile surveys @xcite , which have a sampling interval of 0@xmath7.125 ( roughly the beam size ) .",
    "however , the terminal velocities in @xcite were measured only every 0@xmath7.5 in galactic longitude , due to difficulties involved in the visual examination of a very large number of spectra .",
    "a new derivation of the rotation curve , that uses a computer search code to examine all the available spectra ( @xmath815000 ) , is presented here .",
    "the disk kinematic characteristics in the iv galactic quadrant are analyzed in detail , from this new rotation curve .",
    "these characteristics , as a function of galactocentric radius , are compared with the molecular gas density and with the local rate of massive star formation .",
    "a proper derivation of the spiral pattern of our galaxy requires knowledge of the distances to the adopted tracers .",
    "these distances are also required to compute the masses and luminosities of such tracers . for the gas",
    ", kinematical distances can be obtained from radial velocity data of radio line observations , adopting a rotation curve , under the assumption of pure circular motions . for clouds within the solar circle ,",
    "however , there is a two - fold ambiguity in the kinematic distance , that is difficult to circumvent and has to be resolved in a case - by - case basis .",
    "but in the vicinity of the subcentral points such ambiguity is minimal , since at the subcentral points themselves the kinematic distances are univocally defined .",
    "it is worth noting that large scale streaming motions in spiral arms , with amplitude of @xmath910 km / s , which produce deviations from pure rotation , have been observed in a number of regions of the galaxy ( burton et al .",
    "streaming motions of such amplitude may introduce uncertainties of up to 5% in the estimation of galactocentric radii when the streaming is along the line of sight .",
    "in such unfavorable case , the corresponding uncertainties in the estimated distances , for the section of the galaxy analyzed here , may go from of 0.6 kpc to 1.7 kpc . in any case , for objects beyond @xmath93kpc from the sun , because of optical extinction , kinematical distances are usually the only ones available .",
    "massive stars are formed within aggregates of molecular gas and dust of 10@xmath10 - 10@xmath11 solar masses , about 50 - 100 pc in size , which are commonly known as giant molecular clouds , or gmcs for short .",
    "the association between ob stars and the interstellar medium has been established through optical , infrared , and co observations of gmcs close enough to be largely unaffected by extinction ( orion , carina , etc ) .",
    "the physical conditions in gmcs control their rates of ob star formation , and are one of the main agents that regulate the evolution of the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "there is a close relationship between the galactic spiral structure and the formation of gmcs and , hence , with the formation rate of ob stars @xcite .",
    "therefore , the gmcs and the regions of ob star formation provide a very good tool to trace the spiral arm pattern of a galaxy .",
    "an early description of the milky way spiral arm pattern was given by @xcite , who observed the h109@xmath12 line emitted in hii regions associated with young massive stars . a four arm spiral pattern for the southern milky way was later proposed by @xcite , using a larger observational database of hydrogen recombination lines ( h109@xmath12 & h110@xmath12 ) .",
    "the four arm spiral pattern is in general agreement with that obtained from hi and co large scale observations of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "star formation is likely to occur in regions where the gas in the galactic disk is unstable to the growth of gravitational perturbations . in a classical paper ,",
    "@xcite introduced the parametrization of the volume density of star formation and the volume density of gas , relating them through a power law ; such parametrization , known as \" schmidt law  , has been studied observationally @xcite and explained on theoretical grounds @xcite .",
    "a study of the gas stability in the galactic disk must include ( a ) comparison of the gas density with a critical value above which the gaseous aggregates undergo gravitational collapse @xcite and ( b ) examination of the gas shear rate , that governs the process of destruction of molecular clouds ( e.g. kenney , carlstrom , & young 1993 ; wong & blitz 2002 ) , presumably through the injection of turbulent motions @xcite .",
    "the link between massive star formation and kinematical conditions in disks has been studied mostly for external spiral galaxies @xcite , where the spatial resolution that can be achieved by the observations is not as good as for the milky way .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is , therefore , to accurately describe the spiral arm structure in the _ subcentral vicinity _ of our galaxy , focusing on the molecular gas kinematics , density , and on the rate of massive star formation , with the hope of contributing to the understanding of the formation and evolution of disk galaxies in general .",
    "the analysis is carried out for the iv galactic quadrant , where the spiral structure is more evident @xcite than in the i quadrant .",
    "preliminary work has been presented by @xcite and , more recently by @xcite .",
    "section (  2 ) describes the observational datasets used , the most complete available in their kind .",
    "these data are used in section (  3 ) to derive the rotation curve and analyze the relation between molecular gas kinematics , molecular gas surface density , and massive star formation rate .",
    "the validity of schmidt law for the milky way is analyzed in section (  4 ) , and a summary of the results is given in section  5 .",
    "the data used to derive the rotation curve and the molecular gas surface density are part of the columbia - u .",
    "chile @xmath13co(j=1@xmath00 ) surveys .",
    "these surveys provide us with the most extensive and homogeneous observational dataset of co emission in the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "the beam - size of the antenna in the co line is 8@xmath14.8 , and an angular sampling of 0@xmath15.125 was adopted .",
    "the surveys cover the entire iv galactic quadrant in longitude , and @xmath16 in latitude about the galactic equator .",
    "the velocity resolution is 1.3kms@xmath17 , and the typical rms noise antenna temperature of the observations is 0.1k .",
    "main beam temperatures , @xmath18 , are used throughout the analysis , obtained by dividing the antenna temperature @xmath19 by the main beam efficiency , @xmath20/@xmath21 , with @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "hereinafter we refer to the @xmath13co(j=1@xmath00 ) line as co. for a detailed description of the observations see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the rate of massive star formation is estimated from the integrated fir luminosity @xcite of iras point - like sources , with fir colors of uc hii regions @xcite , detected in a cs(j=2@xmath01 ) survey of 1427 sources in the whole galaxy by bronfman , nyman , & may ( 1996 ) .",
    "the cs(j=2@xmath01 ) emission line requires high molecular gas densities , of @xmath23 - @xmath24@xmath25 , to become excited .",
    "therefore , it constitutes a good tracer of massive star forming regions .",
    "the survey used here is the most complete currently available , listing 843 massive star forming regions in the galactic disk ; the observed velocity profiles provide a good estimator of kinematical distances to the sources .",
    "the observations of the cs(j=2@xmath01 ) line toward the iv galactic quadrant were obtained with the sest ( swedish - eso sub - millimeter telescope ) at la silla observatory , in chile , with a beam - size of 50  .",
    "typical rms noise in the spectra is 0.1 k , at a velocity resolution of 0.52kms@xmath17 .",
    "the radial velocity coverage is 260kms@xmath17 , large enough to detect all the sources in the radial velocity range allowed within the solar circle .",
    "hereinafter we refer to the cs(j=2@xmath01 ) transition as cs , and to the iras point - like sources detected in cs as iras / cs sources .",
    "a number of 66 sources from the @xcite survey are used in the present analysis .",
    "this number was complemented with 13 sources , undetected in the original cs survey , yet detected in a new cs survey with three times better sensitivity , completed with the sest telescope , to be published elsewhere .",
    "the present analysis adopts the iau recommended values for the galactocentric distance of the sun and for the solar circular velocity , i.e. @xmath26kpc and @xmath27kms@xmath17 respectively @xcite .",
    "the analysis excludes galactic longitudes from 350@xmath15 to 360@xmath15 , because the method used to derive the kinematical distance is highly uncertain for that region .",
    "furthermore , the kinematics of the central region of the milky way are more complex than those of the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "the rotation curve is derived from _ terminal velocities _ of co spectra at each sampled galactic longitude @xmath28 .",
    "since the emission in the iv quadrant is blue - shifted , the most negative velocity is recorded , as well as the galactic latitude @xmath29 where it occurs ( fig .",
    "1 ) . to define the terminal velocity , following work by @xcite for hi and by @xcite for co , the half intensity point of the blue - shifted side of the emission peak with the most negative velocity",
    "is selected ( fig .",
    "2 ) . to be considered ,",
    "an emission peak is required to be larger than 4 times the noise temperature @xmath30 .",
    "the emission lines thus selected have an average peak temperature of @xmath31k , and an average hwhm of @xmath32kms@xmath17 .",
    "the rotation curve is obtained from the set of terminal velocities by assigning to every longitude a subcentral point of galactocentric distance @xmath33 and heliocentric distance @xmath34 .",
    "the rotational velocity is then derived for each subcentral point , and assigned to the galactocentric radius @xmath33 , under the assumption of ( a ) pure circular motions and ( b ) differential rotation with angular velocity not growing with galactocentric radius @xcite .",
    "the rotation curve obtained , shown in figure 3 ( _ top _ ) , is similar to that derived by @xcite , but more detailed ; the agreement for the longitude range covered in both studies is better than @xmath35kms@xmath17 ( rms ) .",
    "a slight difference is apparent in the radial range @xmath36 [ 0.56,0.62 ] , where their analysis yields a systematic shift in velocity of @xmath37kms@xmath17 .",
    "the distance @xmath38 of the subcentral point to the galactic plane ( fig .",
    "3 _ bottom _ ) is also determined , for each longitude , providing a simple tool to examine the @xmath39 distribution of the co emission as a function of galactocentric radius .",
    "the results obtained compare well with those by @xcite , which adopted the same method , and with those obtained from an axisymmetric analysis of the co emission in the iv quadrant @xcite .",
    "the rotation curve contains vast amount of information about the kinematics of the galactic disk @xcite . among the principal parameters characterizing the kinematics , derived here ,",
    "are @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which describe the radial trends of shear and vorticity , respectively ; these parameters , when evaluated at @xmath40 , correspond to the well known oort s constants .",
    "as observed from a non - inertial coordinate frame , e.g. that centered on the sun ( local standard of rest , lsr ) , the balance between coriolis , centrifugal , and gravitational forces induce non - circular orbits about the galactic center .",
    "these motions can be described as small periodic oscillations superimposed onto circular orbits . in a coordinate frame with its origin in the galactic center and corotating with the solar orbit ,",
    "these periodic oscillations trace small ellipses called _ epicycles _ , with an associated _ epicyclic frequency _",

    "4 _ top _ ) is used in the calculation , in order to provide continuity for the derivative of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath47 .",
    "the size of the smoothing box is 0.5kpc , smaller than the typical width of spiral arms .",
    "there are three galactocentric radial regions , marked in fig .",
    "4 _ top _ , where @xmath48 increases monotonically , so that the radial derivative is positive and roughly constant , i.e. the signature of solid body rotation .",
    "the kinematical parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath2 , and @xmath1 , as functions of galactocentric radius , are shown in figure 4 ( _ bottom _ ) .    the angular velocity , @xmath1 , the epicyclic frequency , @xmath2 , and the parameter @xmath3 , describing the shear , decrease on the average with galactocentric radius . on the contrary , the parameter @xmath4 , describing the vorticity , grows with galactocentric radius .",
    "the shear and vorticity present three relative minima , coincident with local maxima of the epicyclic frequency @xmath2 , at radii 0.39 , 0.47 and 0.73 @xmath49 .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 , directly proportional to the radial derivative of the angular velocity , tends to zero at these radii , so the angular velocity is almost constant , a characteristic of solid body rotation .",
    "the relative maxima in @xmath2 at these three radii can be interpretated also as evidence for solid body rotation ; at a given galactocentric radius , @xmath41 would be @xmath50 times higher for solid body rotation than for a flat rotation curve @xmath51 = constant .",
    "the results of our analysis are consistent with other work in that the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 at @xmath40 , are very close to the values of the oort s constants @xmath52 and @xmath53 recommended by the iau @xcite .",
    "the values derived here are obtained from linear fits to @xmath3 and @xmath4 , within the range 0.83 to @xmath54 , extrapolated to @xmath55 .",
    "our results yield @xmath56 kms@xmath17kpc@xmath17 , and @xmath57 kms@xmath17kpc@xmath17 , in good agreement with those recommended by the iau , @xmath58 kms@xmath17kpc@xmath17 and @xmath59 kms@xmath17kpc@xmath17 . in a similar manner a value of @xmath60kms@xmath17kpc@xmath17",
    "is obtained for the epicyclic frequency at @xmath61 , in agreement with the value of @xmath62 kms@xmath17kpc@xmath17 given by @xcite .",
    "the angular velocity obtained for @xmath61 , @xmath63 kms@xmath17kpc@xmath17 , is comparable with the value of @xmath64 kms@xmath17kpc@xmath17 , derived for the spiral pattern angular velocity ( fernndez , figueras , & torra 2001 ) .",
    "our results therefore suggest that the sun location is close to the corotation radius ( see also discussion in amaral & lepine 1997 ) .      to study the possible relationships between the kinematical characteristics of the galaxy , the molecular gas density distribution and the massive star formation rates ( msfr ) , it is necessary to use consistent data sets .",
    "the densities and msfrs should be estimated , preferentially , for the very same regions for which the kinematics have been inferred .",
    "the rotation curve is obtained using information from the subcentral points of the disk , so the densities and msfrs we wish to examine are evaluated in regions adjacent to the subcentral points .",
    "such procedure advantageously minimizes the two - fold ambiguity in kinematical distance occurring within the solar circle since , at the subcentral points , kinematical distances are univocally defined @xcite .    limiting the analysis to a reduced area of the longitude - velocity space avoids also the azimuthal averaging of physical conditions which pertain both to spiral arms and to inter - arm regions , a difficulty that appears in axisymmetric analysis of the entire longitude - velocity space .",
    "azimuthal averaging , over disk annuli , of the gas surface density and star formation rates , allows derivation of the star formation activity threshold in disk galaxies @xcite ; the detailed information on the spiral structure of the disk , however , is washed out in the azimuthal average .    the `` _ subcentral vicinity _ '' , used to inspect the gas physical conditions and msfr , is defined here , at each galactic longitude , as the velocity span between the terminal velocity and the terminal velocity plus @xmath65kms@xmath17 ( fig .",
    "the value of @xmath66kms@xmath17 is large enough to include all the emission from each co profile component used to select a terminal velocity .",
    "were the emission to be interpreted as originated by a set of clouds at different velocities , the range @xmath67 implied by @xmath65kms@xmath17 would be 0.5 kpc at @xmath68 and 0.2 kpc at @xmath69 , roughly the longitude limits of the analyzed region .",
    "these values of @xmath67 are small compared to the large scale trends with respect to galactocentric radius and therefore do not affect our conclusions .",
    "the properties of the ism , molecular gas face - on surface density and msfr per unit area , are averaged within the subcentral vicinity , to evaluate their dependance on galactocentric radius .",
    "it is assumed that the gas shares the kinematics of the corresponding subcentral point at each longitude .",
    "the molecular gas face - on surface density is computed from the same co database used to derive the rotation curve , while the msfr is computed from the fir luminosity of the iras / cs sources .",
    "the derivation of molecular clouds mass from our co survey data is based on the widely made assumption that the velocity - integrated co intensity is directly proportional to the total h@xmath70 column density in molecular clouds , and is therefore proportional ( with a correction to account for helium ) to the total molecular gas mass column density . @xcite . to evaluate the molecular gas surface density , @xmath71 , the co emission is binned in galactocentric annuli of thickness 0.05@xmath49 and , for each radial bin , integrated over all velocities within the subcentral vicinity and over @xmath72 $ ] in latitude .",
    "the resultant quantity is divided by the sampled face - on area .",
    "the proportionality factor @xmath73 adopted , where n(h@xmath74co ) , is equal to @xmath75 @xmath76 ( kkms@xmath77 , @xcite .",
    "a correction of 1.36 is used to account for helium ( see murphy & may 1991 ) .",
    "the results obtained for the gas surface density in the subcentral vicinity , within the solar circle , are shown in figure 6 ( _ top _ ) .",
    "massive stars form in the dense cores of giant molecular clouds .",
    "the uv radiation from the young stars heats the surrounding dust , which re - radiates the energy principally in the far infrared .",
    "most of these cores are detected as iras point - like sources , with fir colors typical of ultra - compact hii regions @xcite .",
    "the density is high enough for the excitation of the cs line , above @xmath23 - @xmath24@xmath25 @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , the rate of massive star formation as a function of galactocentric radius is computed by adding the fir luminosity of the iras / cs sources that fall within each radial bin .",
    "@xmath78.\\ ] ]    the fir luminosity is evaluated as @xmath79 @xcite , where @xmath80 is the subcentral distance ,    @xmath81    and @xmath82 are the fir fluxes of the iras / cs point - sources in the four iras bands , as published in the point source catalog .",
    "the galactic fir face - on surface luminosity of iras / cs sources as a function of galactocentric radius , for the subcentral vicinity , is presented in figure 6 ( _ bottom _ ) , compared with the axisymmetric analysis of the complete southern galactic disk by @xcite .",
    "the fir surface luminosity estimated here for massive star forming regions constitutes only a lower limit , since the emitting regions powered by embedded massive stars can be more extended than the iras resolution .",
    "but deconvolution of the extended fir continuum emission can be much more difficult because of superposition of sources along the line of sight . for point - like",
    "sources there is no such confusion since all the cs profiles measured have only one velocity component @xcite and , therefore , the derivation of kinematical distances is straightforward .    the derived msfr per unit area ( figure 7_c _ ) has relative maxima at the same galactocentric radial regions than the molecular gas surface density ( fig .",
    "these radial regions are characterized by solid - body like rotation , as shown in the smoothed version of the rotation curve displayed in ( fig .",

    "the toomre criterion for disk stability @xcite , used here , is described through the @xmath83 stability parameter for gas , defined by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the velocity dispersion , g is the gravitational constant , @xmath71 is the gas surface density and @xmath12 is a dimensionless parameter that accounts for deviations of real disks from the idealized toomre thin disk , single fluid model ( tan 2000 ) . when @xmath86 a gaseous disk is gravitationally unstable .",

    "the destruction of clouds by shearing motions , therefore , is an important parameter controlling the large scale star formation in the disk , particularly in the inter - arm regions where shear dominates gravitational stability .",
    "high tidal disruption appears to be the agent for gmc destruction in the inter - arm regions , inhibiting the formation of massive stars , while low tidal disruption facilitates the accumulation of gas in the arms , increasing the gas surface density locally and promoting the higher observed msfr .",
    "regions of solid body rotation should present less collisions due to the low shearing motions and , therefore , the msfr could presumably be limited by a process different from shear .",
    "the relation between solid body motion and enhanced star formation has been also found for external galaxies .",
    "a nearby example of a galaxy in which shear instability may regulate star formation is m33 @xcite . using a shear stability criterion",
    ", they find that the predicted outer threshold radius for star formation is consistent with the observed drop in the h@xmath12 surface brightness .",
    "another example is the central region of ngc3504 .",
    "the molecular gas kinematics are derived by @xcite , and compared with the rate of star formation obtained from the h@xmath12 recombination line .",
    "the central region of ngc3504 is characterized by solid body kinematics and high rate of star formation ; they propose that the behavior of star formation is strongly influenced by the strength of tidal shear , which can help control the star formation rate via cloud destruction . for irregular galaxies , @xcite notice that in slowly raising rotation curves , characteristic of this type of galaxies , the stability parameter derived by @xcite ( eq . 8) , provides a good criterion to describe the boundary between cloud survival and disruption .",
    "the conclusions of these authors are similar to our results for the southern milky way arms , which show solid body kinematics , i.e. that the sf is strongly influenced by tidal shear , and in particular that tidal shear controls the rate of star formation through cloud destruction .",
    "theoretical work in agreement with the present results has been presented by @xcite .",
    "they use a galactic disk model where the ism is simulated by a system of particles , representing clouds , which orbit in a one arm spiral - perturbed gravitational field , and include dissipative cloud - cloud collision .",
    "their conclusion is that the distribution of gmcs and star formation is enhanced across the full finite width of the spiral arm and is not restricted to either the preshock or postshock regions .",
    "the agreement between their theoretical results and our observations implies that the best tracer for molecular gas spiral structure is the kinematical parameter that compares gravitational stability and cloud shear destruction ( @xmath115 , fig .",
    "7_f _ ) , and is also the simplest one , because it involves only kinematical parameters that can be derived directly from the rotation curve .",
    "spiral arm regions can be identified , therefore , as those where shear disruption of clouds has less influence than gravitational instabilities , so that molecular clouds can pile up , increasing their mass and evolving , until they collapse to form stars that will thereby increase the mean kinetic temperature .",
    "such increment in temperature in the spiral arm regions has been preliminarily measured by @xcite .",
    "there is a good correlation , as shown in section 3.7 , between the msfr per unit area ( fig .",
    "7_c _ ) and the molecular gas face - on surface density ( fig .",
    "7_b _ ) in the milky way .",
    "such kind of correlation , formally known as schmidt law , has been explored mostly for external galaxies . in this section",
    "we evaluate , for the subcentral vicinity of the milky way disk , four different enunciations of the schmidt law , whose simplest form @xcite is , in our case ,    @xmath124    previous efforts at deriving the schmidt law for the milky way include those of @xcite , who find values of n between 1.3 and 2.0 , based on the distribution of ob associations , h ii regions , h i , and early co surveys ; and @xcite , who using known gaseous and stellar radial profiles , find that the schmidt law is satisfied for the milky way from r = 4 to 15 kpc .",
    "recently @xcite , in a general theory of turbulence - regulated star formation in galaxies , predict the star formation rate as a function of galactocentric radius for the milky way taking into account the fraction of molecular gas in the form of clouds , and enunciate schmidt law in the assumption that the clouds are virialized and supersonically turbulent .",
    "a second form of the schmidt law , which modulates the gas density by a kinematical parameter , in this case the angular velocity @xmath116 @xcite , is given by    @xmath125    a third derivation of the schmidt law @xcite , can be expressed as    @xmath126    with    @xmath127}{d [ \\ln ( r)]},\\ ] ]    where @xmath128 is the circular velocity at a particular galactocentric radius .",
    "this version of schmidt law has the advantage that the proportionality constant can be derived from theory , and includes evaluation of the mean free path for cloud - cloud collision , the fraction of collisions that lead to star formation , and the fraction of gas transformed into stars in each collision .    a fourth derivation , of theoretical character , that assumes molecular clouds to be virialized and supersonically turbulent , has been given by @xcite , and is expressed here as    @xmath129    where @xmath130 is the fraction of gas in the form of molecular clouds    the four enunciations of schmidt law are tested ( figure 8) using the values of molecular gas face - on surface density and of the msfr per unit area obtained here for galactocentric radial bins in the milky way .",
    "although most derivations of schmidt law include both atomic and molecular gas , our calculations are limited to the molecular gas component of the ism . @xcite",
    "have found , for a set of seven galaxies , that the azimuthally averaged star formation rate per unit area correlates much better with @xmath131 than with @xmath132 .",
    "one should note that they required a large , uncertain correction for extinction to derive the rate of star formation using h@xmath12 images ; however , such correction does not affect their main conclusion , i. e. , that considering the total gas density , rather than h@xmath133 and h@xmath134 separately , may obscure underlying physical processes that are essential to star formation .",
    "the situation may be presumably different in galaxies where the ism is predominantly atomic ; however , even for m33 , with a predominantly atomic ism , @xcite has shown that the star formation rate per unit area still correlates better with @xmath131 than with @xmath132 .",
    "the schmidt law is roughly satisfied in all four cases analyzed , with a power index close to 1 .",
    "the dispersion of the data points is large if all radial bins are taken into account ; however , the relation becomes much tighter if the radial bins that correspond to interarm regions , shown in figure 8 as thin squares , are removed .",
    "for the simplest relation ( fig . 8_a _ ) , @xmath135 , the index value @xmath136 obtained is in good agreement with those derived for extragalactic disks @xcite .",
    "the relation plotted at figure 8_b _ , taking into account the kinematics through the angular velocity @xmath116 , with an index value @xmath137 , is in very good agrement with @xcite .",
    "because they derive an index from disk - averaged values for a set of galaxies , rather than the variation of star formation rate with surface density within a galaxy , presumably describing quite different processes , our results show an underlaying physical link between @xmath71 and @xmath108 that dominates both local and global scales in the process of star formation .",
    "the relation for the schmidt law at figure 8_c _ , dependent on the kinematics , as proposed by @xcite , shows a relation with an index value @xmath138 , consistent with theory .",
    "an index of @xmath139 is obtained when fitting the relation derived by @xcite , using a value of @xmath140 @xcite .",
    "it is apparent that the simplest form ( fig .",
    "8_a _ ) of schmidt law , that normally describes the averaged properties of disks of galaxies @xcite , applies also fairly well to @xmath108 in a scale range which is much smaller , like the radial bins in the milky way .",
    "the galactic disk kinematics , through shear , additionally modulates the global star formation in the galactic disk ; destroys the clouds in the interarm regions and permits the piling up of gas in the spiral arms , allowing gravity or another agents like compression and turbulence ( via supernovas ) , to collapse the clouds into stars ( see recent reviews by @xcite .",
    "the gas depletion timescale due to star formation , @xmath141 , can be crudely estimated from the derived msfr per unit area , @xmath108 , and the molecular gas surface density , @xmath71 ,    @xmath142    the galactocentric trend of @xmath143 is shown in figure 9 ( _ top _ ) .",
    "its average value is 10@xmath144yr , an upper limit since @xmath108 represents a lower limit .",
    "the timescale for growth of gmcs through gravitational instabilities can be expressed as @xmath145q/@xmath41 @xcite .",
    "results here yield timescales of the order @xmath146yr , with relative minima at the location of the spiral arm tangents ( fig .",
    "9 _ middle _ ) . following @xcite , the efficiency of star formation ( @xmath147 ) can be estimated via @xmath141=@xmath148 if the timescales for gravitational instabilities ( @xmath149 ) are similar to the timescale for cloud collapse .",
    "the values of a few tenths of a percent obtained , however , are rather low as compared with values of a few percent typically reported in the literature .",
    "the efficiency for massive star formation , according to @xcite , can be further expressed as    @xmath150    adopting a typical lifetime for an ob star region of @xmath151yr and our results for @xmath108 and @xmath71 we obtain values for @xmath152 of a few percent in the spiral arms , and extremely low values for inter - arm regions , ( fig .",
    "9 _ bottom _ ) .",
    "a comparison of the timescales of gas consumption and growth of gravitational instabilities , as a function of galactocentric radius , suggests that fast star formation is present in regions where rapid cloud growth takes place .",
    "this work analyzes the correlation between molecular gas kinematical properties , molecular gas surface density , and rate of massive star formation in the iv galactic quadrant , using the most complete data bases available .",
    "the analysis is carried out for galactocentric radial bins 0.5 kpc wide , a compromise to avoid arm - interarm confusion while having good statistics .",
    "the data used are restricted to the subcentral vicinity , to avoid the two - fold distance ambiguity within the solar circle .",
    "the main conclusions are :    @xmath153 the rotation curve obtained is similar to that presented by alvarez et al .",
    "since the sampling in longitude is 4 times denser , however , it can be used to calculate , as a function of galactocentric radius , kinematical parameters that require radial derivatives .",
    "@xmath153 the angular velocity , @xmath1 , the epicyclic frequency , @xmath2 , and the parameter @xmath3 describing the gas shear , tend to decrease with galactocentric radius ; the parameter @xmath4 , describing the gas vorticity , tends to grow .",
    "the values derived for oort s constants @xmath52 and @xmath53 , at r = @xmath154 , are consistent with those recommended by the iau .",
    "@xmath153 shear and vorticity have relative minima , and the epicyclic frequency relative maxima , at radii 0.39 , 0.47 and 0.73 @xmath49 , coincident with the known positions of spiral arm tangent regions .",
    "near these radii the kinematics are characteristic of solid body rotation : @xmath3 , proportional to the radial derivative of the angular velocity , tends to zero , so the angular velocity is roughly constant .",
    "the relative maxima in epicyclic frequency are consistent with such scenario since @xmath41 is @xmath50 times higher for solid body rotation than for a flat rotation curve .",
    "@xmath153 differential rotation and shear are weaker for the spiral arm regions than for the interarm regions .",
    "the relative importance of tidal shear w / r to gravitation in the stability of the gas for spiral arm regions , where the rotation curve resembles that of a solid body , is half than for spiral arms , where the rotation curve is nearly flat .    @xmath153",
    "massive star formation occurs in regions of high molecular gas density , roughly coincident with the three lines of sight tangent to spiral arms . in these arms",
    "the formation of massive stars follows the schmidt law , @xmath155^n$ ] , with an index of @xmath156 . while this law is characteristic of spiral galactic disks , here it applies to much smaller spatial scale . a modified version of schmidt law , which modulates the gas density by the angular velocity , @xmath157 , describes better the behavior of the gas at this scale , suggesting that the kinematics , through shear , regulate global star formation in the galactic disk .",
