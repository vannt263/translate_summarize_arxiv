    "our current theoretical and observational understanding of star formation holds that most stars form in multiple systems , with the frequency , mass ratio distribution and period distribution of multiples varying as a function of mass and possibly formation environment ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "dynamics play an important role in multiple formation , as both the fragmentation of collapsing cloud cores @xcite and massive circumstellar disks @xcite give rise to small n groups that either dissolve or stabilize into hierarchical systems .",
    "numerical calculations show that both fragmentation and dynamical evolution of stellar multiples are sensitive to the initial cloud properties  geometry , density , turbulence spectrum , and radiative and external feedback ",
    "so multiplicity statistics provide important tests for star formation theory , on par with the initial mass function , stellar mass segregation and velocity distributions .",
    "the mass dependence of multiplicity among stars is well established , with observed frequencies ranging from @xmath580% for oba dwarfs to @xmath630% for systems with m dwarf primaries @xcite .",
    "the frequency of multiples appears to drop even further in the very low mass ( vlm ; m @xmath7 0.1  m@xmath4 ) stellar and substellar regimes .",
    "resolved imaging studies of field and cluster vlm dwarfs , based on ground - based adaptive optics ( ao ) and hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations , find relatively consistent ( volume - limited ) binary frequencies of 1020% ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , estimates for the frequency of tightly - bound spectroscopic vlm binaries ( roughly 10% of currently known systems ) span a broad range of 125% . as such",
    ", there remains significant uncertainty in the overall vlm binary frequency , which has a direct impact on our understanding of how brown dwarfs form in the first place ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there is also evidence that the orbital characteristics of multiples are mass - dependent , with vlm binaries being on average tighter ( @xmath8 7  au versus @xmath9 30  au ) and more frequently composed of equal - mass components ( @xmath10 versus @xmath9 0.3 ) than their solar - mass counterparts @xcite .",
    "again , these trends may be skewed by biases inherent to the known sample of vlm binaries , identified largely as imaged pairs .",
    "a complete understanding of vlm multiplicity statistics therefore requires more robust constraints on the frequency and characteristics of short - period and low-@xmath11 multiples @xcite .    an alternative method for identifying vlm multiples that avoids separation biases ( both intrinsic and projected ) is through spectral binaries , systems with components of different spectral types whose combined - light spectra exhibit distinct peculiarities .",
    "while this technique is more commonly associated with white dwarf - m dwarf pairs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , spectral binaries containing late m or l dwarf primaries and t dwarf secondaries have also been recognized due to their unique and highly structured near - infrared spectra @xcite .",
    "because blended light systems can be identified at any separation , m / l+t spectral binaries can probe the very closest separations that are inaccessible to direct imaging studies ( @xmath12 50  mas ) .",
    "an illustrative case is the m8.5 + t5 binary 2mass  j03202839@xmath00446358 ( hereafter 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 ) , a system independently identified as both a spectral binary @xcite and a radial velocity ( rv ) variable with a period of 0.68  yr and primary semi - major axis @xmath13 = 0.157@xmath10.003  au @xcite . with a projected separation of @xmath917  mas ,",
    "this system is unresolvable with current imaging and interferometric technology .",
    "moreover , the significant difference in component magnitudes ( @xmath14 = 4.3@xmath10.6 ) makes this system a potential low @xmath11 pair .",
    "the independent constraints provided by the component classifications and rv orbit yield robust limits on the age ( @xmath152  gyr ) and orbital inclination ( @xmath16 ) of this system @xcite .    in an effort to confirm and characterize spectral binaries identified in low - resolution near - infrared spectroscopy , we have identified a new vlm system exhibiting significant rv variability . the source , sdss  j000649.16@xmath0085246.3 ( hereafter sdss  j0006@xmath00852 ; @xcite ) is an optically - classified m9 which appears to be both a short - period ( 0.4  yr ) binary with m8.5 and t5@xmath11 components , and a co - moving wide companion to the inactive m7 dwarf lp  704 - 48 .",
    "together , this system comprises the lowest - mass triple confirmed to date . in section  2",
    "we describe our optical and near - infrared imaging and spectroscopic observations of this system using the 1 m lick observatory nickel direct imaging camera , the 3 m nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) spex spectrograph @xcite , the 4 m kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) rc spectrograph , and the 10 m keck ii nirspec spectrograph @xcite . in section  3",
    "we examine the properties of the sdss  j0006@xmath00852 and lp  704 - 48 pair , assessing their common proper motion , distance and probability of chance alignment ; as well as the age and metallicity of both components as derived from spectroscopic and kinematic indicators . in section  4",
    "we analyze the low - resolution near - infrared spectrum of sdss  j0006@xmath00852 to infer the presence of , and characterize , its t dwarf companion . in section  5",
    "we analyze our rv measurements which allow us to extract both the orbital properties ( including constraints on the orbital inclination ) and verify the relatively old age for this system . in section  6",
    "we discuss lp  704 - 48/sdss  j0006@xmath00852ab in the context of other hierarchical low - mass triples , and examine whether current star formation theories or three - body interactions can create such systems .",
    "our results are summarized in section  7 .",

    "data were reduced using custom idl scripts that removed the bias voltage , median - combined and normalized the flat field frames ; divided the science data by the flat ; masked bad pixels ; generated a median sky frame that was subtracted from the science data ; and registered and median - stacked the science frames to a single final image , shown in figure  [ fig : nickelim ] .    pixel positions for sources in the final stacked frame were measured using a centroiding algorithm routine attached to the _ atv _ program @xcite . using astrometry of 13 field stars drawn from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) , we determined a linear astrometric transformation frame with residuals of 0@xmath173 in right ascension and 0@xmath172 and declination ; i.e. , @xmath620% of the seeing radius .",

    "given the now established existence of a handful of vlm triples like lp  704 - 48/sdss  j0006@xmath00852ab , it is worth examining whether such systems and their characteristics match the predictions of star and brown dwarf formation models .",
    "we emphasize that current samples are far from statistically robust or complete , and detection biases may be significant .    despite the low production rate of vlm multiples in general , current models do produce vlm higher - order systems .",

    "most of these systems were widely separated and hierarchical , typically with the distant companion being of low mass ( in systems containing two brown dwarfs , the distant companion was a brown dwarf in 90% of cases ) .",

    "accretion plays an important role in the formation of multiple systems , as a mechanism for angular momentum exchange and dissipation , and driving binaries to near - equal masses ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite recently examined vlm multiplicity in radiative hydrodynamic simulations of molecular cloud collapse , which incorporates both gas accretion ( with some radiative feedback ) and dynamics , albeit over shorter periods than pure n - body simulations due to computational constraints .",

    "no analysis was made of higher - order multiples .",
    "the fragmentation of circumstellar disks around massive stars is another proposed mechanism for forming vlm stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "unfortunately , the predicted binary rate for vlm systems created in these environments is very low ( @xmath68% for ejected systems ) and no low - mass triples have been created in simulations to date .",
    "furthermore , while the separation distribution of simulated substellar pairs peaks in a range that is close to that inferred for sdss  j0006@xmath00852ab ( 0.3 @xmath148 0.6  au ) , these binaries tend to have very large eccentricities ( @xmath149 ) , a feature not seen in any of the vlm spectroscopic binaries identified to date . as such , disk fragmentation does not appear to be a viable mechanism for making triples like lp  704 - 48/sdss  j0006@xmath00852ab .",
    "it is important to emphasize that current models fall short in reproducing very short - period , low - eccentricity vlm pairs like sdss  j0006@xmath00852ab and 2mass  j0320@xmath00446ab .",
    "such systems are necessarily the product of dynamical and dissipative evolution , as opacity - limited fragmentation constrains the initial separations of self - gravitating masses to @xmath1510  au @xcite .",

    ", three - body encounters more often than not disrupt vlm multiples @xcite . a more intriguing mechanism for sdss  j0006@xmath00852ab is kozai - lidov eccentricity perturbations induced by lp  704 - 48 , followed by circularization through tidal friction ( kctf ; @xcite ) .",
    "this mechanism has been proposed to explain the high fraction of spectroscopic binaries with tertiary companions ( 96% for sbs with @xmath1503  dy ; ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "kctf predicts end states with roughly circular inner orbits and large period ratios ( @xmath151 ; @xcite ) , similar to sdss  j0006@xmath00852ab .",
    "unfortunately , the timescale for eccentricity pumping is long for lp  704 - 48/sdss  j0006@xmath00852ab ( @xmath152 @xmath9 3  gyr ) , while tidal circularization is extremely inefficient at the current orbital separation of sdss  j0006@xmath00852ab ] where @xmath153 is the primary s love number , @xmath11 the mass ratio , @xmath154 and @xmath155 the final semimajor axis and period , @xmath156 the primary s radius and @xmath39 the tidal lag with respect to the displacement between primary and secondary . assuming @xmath157 ( i.e.",

    "a final possibility is that lp  704 - 48 has played no role in the evolution of the sdss  j0006@xmath00852ab binary , which could have shrunk and circularized through dissipative interactions with an early circumbinary disk or a closer encounter resulting in an ejection .",
    "the wider pairing with lp  704 - 48 may simply be a normal ( albeit rare ) outcome of cloud fragmentation or parallel trajectories during the dissolution of the natal cluster @xcite .",
    "lp  704 - 48 and sdss  j0006@xmath00852ab may be more akin to stellar cousins that stellar siblings .",
    "we have identified a hierarchical triple system , lp  704 - 48/sdss  j0006@xmath00852ab , composed of a tight ( @xmath163  au ) m9 plus t5@xmath11 binary straddling the hydrogen burning mass limit , with a wide ( @xmath164 820  au ) , inactive m7 co - moving companion .",
    "the inner pair is found to be both a spectral ( blended light ) binary and a radial velocity variable . by combining model - dependent mass constraints from the component spectral types , the radial velocity of lp  704 - 48 , and orbit model fits of the rv data ( spanning more than three orbital periods ) , we have determined the orbital parameters of sdss  j0006@xmath00852ab , including constraints on the orbit inclination and the system s age ( @xmath153  gyr ) .",
    "the latter is consistent with the age inferred for lp  704 - 48 based on its lack of h@xmath3 emission ( 8@xmath55  gyr ) .",
    "sdss  j0006@xmath00852ab is currently the third tightest vlm binary known , and its identification verifies that the spectral binary method can probe a relatively unexplored separation range among vlm multiples . with lp  704 - 48 ,",
    "this system forms the lowest - mass triple identified to date whose tertiary is unambiguously detected , and is one of seven confirmed and candidate vlm triples whose total mass is @xmath70.3  m@xmath4 .",
    "while current star formation models are capable of producing triples with substellar components , we find that they do not yet produce systems that replicate vlm triples like lp  704 - 48/sdss  j0006@xmath00852ab .",
    "in particular , dynamical interactions alone do not appear to be responsible for the close separation of the sdss  j0006@xmath00852ab pair , while disk fragmentation and hydrodynamic models have yet to produce comparable systems .",
    "we also rule out kozai - lidov perturbations and tidal circularization for the current configuration of this system . as most of the @xmath165  yr vlm binaries found to date are isolated pairs , we speculate that lp  704 - 48 and sdss  j0006@xmath00852ab formed as two separate systems bound only by proximity and/or common motion after cluster dissolution .",

    "<S> we report the identification of the m9 dwarf sdss  j000649.16@xmath0085246.3 as a spectral binary and radial velocity variable with components straddling the hydrogen burning mass limit . </S>",
    "<S> low - resolution near - infrared spectroscopy reveals spectral features indicative of a t dwarf companion , and spectral template fitting yields component types of m8.5@xmath10.5 and t5@xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> high - resolution near - infrared spectroscopy with keck / nirspec reveals pronounced radial velocity variations with a semi - amplitude of 8.2@xmath10.4  km  s@xmath2 . from these </S>",
    "<S> we determine an orbital period of 147.6@xmath11.5  days and eccentricity of 0.10@xmath10.07 , making sdss  j0006@xmath00852ab the third tightest very low mass binary known . </S>",
    "<S> this system is also found to have a common proper motion companion , the inactive m7 dwarf lp  704 - 48 , at a projected separation of 820@xmath1120  au . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of h@xmath3 emission in both m dwarf components indicates that this system is relatively old , as confirmed by evolutionary model analysis of the tight binary . </S>",
    "<S> lp  704 - 48/sdss  j0006@xmath00852ab is the lowest - mass confirmed triple identified to date , and one of only seven candidate and confirmed triples with total masses below 0.3  m@xmath4 currently known . we show that current star and brown dwarf formation models can not produce triple systems like lp  704 - 48/sdss  j0006@xmath00852ab , and we rule out kozai - lidov perturbations and tidal circularization as a viable mechanism to shrink the inner orbit . the similarities between this system and the recently uncovered low - mass eclipsing triples nltt  41135ab/41136 and lhs  6343abc suggest that substellar tertiaries may be common in wide m dwarf pairs . </S>"
