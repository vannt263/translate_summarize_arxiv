    "the effective action approach  @xcite can be seen as an elegant way of defining a generating functional for one - particle - irreducible green s functions . following wilson s idea  @xcite one can study the effect of integrated quantum degrees of freedom at different scales @xmath0 .",
    "the scale dependent effective action @xmath2 is to be understood as interpolation between the ultraviolet ( uv ) bare action @xmath3 and the fully integrated action in the ir @xmath4 as it is sketched in figure  [ fig : schema ] .",
    "effective action @xmath2 in theory space where ideally @xmath5 and the dotted line indicates an integration of @xmath6 over momentum degrees of freedom with @xmath7.,width=377 ]    @xmath2 contains scale dependent couplings @xmath8 which are obtained from a suitable flow equation @xmath9  .",
    "the space of solutions @xmath8 is called the `` coupling flow ''  @xcite .",
    "a specific trajectory is selected out of this flow by imposing conditions for the couplings at an initial scale @xmath10 .",
    "the evaluation of the effective action @xmath2 is typically hampered by various technical difficulties such as singularities , anomalies , and non - localities .",
    "however , in many cases those difficulties can be overcome by the `` regularization - renormalization '' technique , where infinities are absorbed in the initial conditions at a scale @xmath10 .",
    "the technical details of this procedure will not be presented here , since they are not relevant for the following discussion .",
    "it will be assumed that the effective action @xmath2 has already been calculated .",
    "minimizing a given effective action with respect to variations of its ( average ) field content @xmath6 gives the equations of motion of the effective action [ gap0 ] = 0 .",
    "those equations are typically non - linear and sometimes non - local differential equations and are frequently referred to as `` gap equations ''  @xcite .",
    "solutions of those equations have minimal energy ( gibbs free energy in statistical mechanics ) .",
    "therefore , finding solutions for the `` gap equations '' is highly relevant for defining a self - consistent background in quantum field theory .",
    "however , even if it is technically possible to solve the `` gap equations '' , the physical interpretation of such a solution is still biased by the way the scale @xmath0 is related to the quantities @xmath11 ( for example positions and charges ) that are used to describe the physical system . choosing a relation @xmath12",
    "is called `` scale setting '' .",
    "the main focus of this article is on the role of scale setting in the quest of finding self - consistent solutions of ( [ gap0 ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : imp ] the approach of improving classical solutions , is studied and a criterion for scale setting is proposed .",
    "section [ sec : ssproposed ] goes beyond improving classical solutions by studying the `` gap equations '' .",
    "a scale setting is proposed in terms of an additional equation of motion . the self - consistency and predictively of this approach",
    "is then studied for specific examples such as scalar @xmath1 theory in section [ sec : phi4 ] and the einstein - hilbert - maxwell action in section [ sec : ehm ] .",
    "conclusions can be found in section [ sec : sum ] .",
    "the method of improving solutions has been successfully applied in many different contexts @xcite .",
    "this intuitive method is potentially useful when perturbation theory has limited reliability such as for strong coupling or for non - renormalizable theories .    instead of turning to one of the particular examples",
    ", this approach will be discussed in quite generic fashion .",
    "lets assume a quite general @xmath1 quantum field theory with bare fields @xmath13 and generic couplings @xmath14 with the equations of motion [ eomgen00 ] ( _ a)+ g^abcd ( _ b_c_d)=0 , where @xmath15 is some differential operator ( for example @xmath16 ) .",
    "lets further assume that the classical solution of ( [ eomgen00 ] ) is given by _",
    "a=^0_a(r,,g_n , a ) , where @xmath17 are the coordinates and @xmath18 are integration constants .",
    "renormalization methods allow to calculate quantum corrections to the couplings at arbitrary scale @xmath0 , such that the couplings of the bare theory become scale dependent quantities ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "how , do those supposedly small quantum corrections modify the form of the classical solution ?",
    "one approach to address this question is given the improving solutions procedure  @xcite , where one assumes that the classical solution is actually the quantum solution at a certain scale say @xmath20 .",
    "for the case of simplicity lets choose @xmath21 , just as it is done for the electromagnetic coupling in the standard model . at this scale the classical equation of motion [ eomgen0 ] ( _ 0 ^0_a)+ g_0^abcd ( ^0_b^0_c^0_d)=0 ,",
    "is solved by @xmath22 and the @xmath0 dependence is a small correction to this solution . in this scheme",
    "one assumes that at first order , the functional form of the solution stays unchanged , and only the couplings have to be replaced by the scale dependent couplings in @xmath23 [ improveansatz ] ( _ 0 , g_0)(_k , g_k ) .",
    "now one makes the ansatz that the classical solution obtains its first order quantum correction only due to the scale dependence of the couplings [ improved1 ] _ a & = & _ a^0(r,_0,g_0,a ) + _ a(r,_k , g_k , a)|_k=0 k + ( k^2 ) , + _",
    "k&=&_0 + _ k |_k=0 k + ( k^2 ) , + g_k&=&g_0 + g_k |_k=0 k + ( k^2 ) .",
    "the second step is perform a scale setting which relates the arbitrary scale @xmath0 to the physical coordinates [ scaleset0 ] k k(r ) .",
    "the explicit form for this scale setting is however a priory not uniquely determined ( in static spherically symmetric problems it has for example been proposed to use @xmath24 ) .",
    "one first consistency check for this procedure would be to improve the equations of motion ( [ eomgen00 ] ) in the same way and to check whether the improved solution ( [ improved1 ] ) is actually a solution ( up to order @xmath25 ) of those equations . inserting ( [ improved1 ] ) into ( [ eomgen00 ] )",
    "one obtains [ eomsecondline ] 0&= & ( _ 0 ^0_a)+ g_0^abcd ( ^0_b^0_c^0_d ) + & & + + ( k ) g_k^abcd ( ^k_b^k_c^k_d)|_k=0 + ( k^2 ) . using ( [ eomgen0 ] ) the first line is identically zero and one obtains that the second line has to be zero too , if one wants to insist on the improved equations . in most of the articles cited above",
    "it was not imposed that the improved equations of motion stay valid and the scale setting was performed basically based on dimensional analysis . at this point",
    "an important questions arises : `` is the coupling @xmath26 inside or outside the square brackets of the differential operator @xmath15 ? ''",
    "this is a priory not clear since starting from the equation of motion ( [ eomgen0 ] ) both alternatives would be equally possible .",
    "however , this question can be `` answered '' ( or say evaded ) if one imposes a particular scale setting ( [ scaleset0 ] ) such that the differential operator commutes with the scale function [ commutesetting ] = 0 . in this case",
    "the second line of ( [ eomsecondline ] ) is equivalent to [ eomsecondline2 ] 0&=&(k ) .|_k=0 + ( k^2 ) .",
    "thus , the remaining task would be first solving ( [ commutesetting ] ) for @xmath0 and then solving ( [ eomsecondline2 ] ) for @xmath27 .    the fact that ( [ commutesetting ] ) can actually serve as a useful way of defining a scale setting can be seen from a simple example :",
    "for the three dimensional laplace operator with spherical symmetry , the condition ( [ commutesetting ] ) reads [ laplacesample ] = 0 .",
    "it is solved for @xmath28 by k(r)= , which indeed agrees perfectly with the ad - hoc intuition coming from a dimensional analysis .",
    "however , there is ( at least ) one other consistency condition one would like to impose , the conservation of the stress - energy tensor , even at the quantum - improved level .",
    "let @xmath29 be the classically conserved stress - energy tensor [ tmunu0 ] ^t^0_=0 , then the straight forward improved stress - energy tensor would be taken to be [ tmunuexp ] t_=t^0_+(t^k_|_k=0)k + ( k^2 ) . imposing conservation of ( [ tmunuexp ] ) and using ( [ tmunu0 ] ) one finds to leading order in @xmath0 [ tmunucond ] ^t_= ^ ( ( t^k_|_k=0)k ) 0 .",
    "if one would try to solve this problem in the same spirit as ( [ commutesetting ] ) by imposing @xmath30\\equiv 0 $ ] one easily finds that this is overly restrictive allowing only for trivial solutions . to circumvent this problem",
    "one can modify the definition ( [ improveansatz ] ) of the stress - energy tensor ( for example by using a different equation of state  @xcite ) but such an ad - hoc redefinition is not completely satisfactory .    to summarize",
    ", one sees that the method of improved solutions ( [ eomsecondline ] ) can be made consistent , even at the level of improved equations of motions if one imposes an adequate scale setting ( [ commutesetting ] ) ( for example @xmath24 for the spherical symmetric laplacian ) . however , it has limitations in the sense that this procedure raises questions in the context of symmetries and conservation laws and that it is restricted to first order corrections only .",
    "this can be taken as motivation for seeking a more elegant way for obtaining a description in the context of scale dependent couplings .",
    "in the previous section it was shown how scale setting can be realized in the improving solutions approach . in this section a more general scale setting at the level of effective action will be proposed .",
    "lets assume that within the quantum field theoretical model it was possible , to evaluate the corresponding coupling flow and to select a particular trajectory due to the choice of initial conditions ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "thus , one can start with the effective quantum action  @xcite _ k(_a(x),_a(x),g^a_k)=d^4x ( _ a(x),_a(x),g^a_k ) , where @xmath6 are actually the expectation values of the quantum fields and @xmath8 are the scale dependent couplings , including the coupling multiplying the kinetic term that is frequently expressed in terms of field renormalization ( see the first two subsections of [ sec : phi4 ] ) .    note that doing this , one frequently has to truncate higher order- or nonlocal couplings  @xcite from the model , that might appear due to the quantum integration procedure . in the following discussion it will however be assumed that all relevant couplings are taken into account .",
    "now , one can derive the equations of motion for the average quantum fields @xmath6 from = 0 . as mentioned in the introduction , the solutions @xmath32 of those `` gap equations '' will also be functions of the arbitrary scale @xmath0 . from a physical point of view",
    "this is however not yet satisfactory since no possible observable can be a function of an a priory arbitrary scale . in order to obtain a physical quantity one has to define some kind of scale setting procedure , that establishes a relation between the physical quantities ( charges @xmath33 and positions @xmath34 ) of a given problem and the scale @xmath0 .",
    "when doing this one can borrow an idea from the calculation of observables @xmath35 in standard quantum field theory .",
    "also there , the observables turn out to be scale `` @xmath0 '' dependent quantities dependence is an artifact of the truncation in the loop expansion ] .",
    "subsequently , the scale setting for those observables in terms of initial conditions and kinematical variables @xmath36 is chosen such that any @xmath0 dependence of the time ordered correlation function ( or some other observable ) is minimized [ qftcond0 ] .t _ 1(x_1 ) _",
    "2(x_2 )  _ k|_k = k_opt0 .",
    "this is the key philosophy that is used when deriving the `` callan - symanzik '' equations  @xcite , the  principal of minimal sensitivity  @xcite , or the `` principle of maximal conformality ''  @xcite .",
    "it is proposed to implement an analogous philosophy at the level of the effective action @xmath2 .",
    "this means that one should choose an optimal scale setting prescription for which a variation of @xmath0 has a minimal impact on the self - consistent background @xmath37 .",
    "this principle can be implemented by promoting the a priory arbitrary scale to a physical scale - field in the effective quantum action [ pres ] _",
    "k(_a(x),_a(x),g^a_k)(_a(x),_a(x),k(x),g^a_k ) .",
    "this leads to the coupled equations of motion [ eomgen ] = 0 , .",
    "( _ a(x),_a(x),k(x),g^a_k)|_k = k_opt=0 .",
    "clearly it is not guaranteed that a solution for ( [ eomgen ] ) can be found , but such a prescription is not limited to be a variation of a classical solution or to a saddle point approximation . the procedure ( [ eomgen ] )",
    "has already been applied for some particular gravitational actions @xcite but in this work it is discussed in a broader context .",
    "a nice feature of such a procedure is that any solution of the equations ( [ eomgen ] ) is automatically independent of @xmath0 , which is actually the fundamental precondition for a physical observable in the language of the renormalization group approach .",
    "promoting the scale @xmath0 to a scale - field @xmath38 raises the question whether this new field only appears in the couplings @xmath39 , or whether it has to be equipped with other additional couplings , for instance a proper kinetic term . a standard procedure when introducing new fields into a lagrangian",
    "is to incorporate actually all couplings that are in agreement with the symmetry of the lagrangian .",
    "this abundant freedom is then restricted by imposing some other additional conditions such as renormalizability , simplicity , and/or agreement with experimental constraints . however , in the presented approach the philosophy is different .",
    "the scale - field @xmath0 is understood to have its origin in the process of renormalization and throughout this process , no such extra couplings are taken into account .",
    "in particular , the beta functions of the couplings @xmath39 are calculated without any additional couplings .",
    "therefore , the presented version of scale - field setting is chosen in a sense `` minimal '' , since it contemplates the appearance of @xmath38 only as dictated by the running couplings @xmath39",
    ".    even though the prescription ( [ pres ] ) looks quite convincing from this perspective , it might be insufficient for example in the sense that the space of solutions of ( [ eomgen ] ) is actually empty , apart from a trivial configuration or it is insufficient in the sense that the conservation of the stress - energy tensor can not be guaranteed either .",
    "therefore , the idea will be studied for some examples , where self - consistency of the approach can be shown explicitly .",
    "as most simple example without any further complications due to gauge symmetry lets study the scale - field setting procedure for scalar @xmath1 theory .",
    "there are various ways of writing the effective action for @xmath1 theory .",
    "one of them is in terms of a scale dependent wave function renormalization @xmath40 , running mass @xmath41 , and running quartic coupling @xmath42 .",
    "the other way of writing this action is terms of separate couplings for every term appearing in the lagrangian , which are a coupling for the kinetic term @xmath26 , a coupling for the @xmath43 term @xmath44 , and a coupling for the quartic term @xmath45 .",
    "as long as the scale @xmath0 is assumed to be fixed , the formalism for both is exactly equivalent .",
    "however , in the context of scale - field setting @xmath46 , derivatives do not necessarily commute with @xmath38 and both formulations could to be treated differently .",
    "this subtlety will be exemplified in the following subsection , before applying the scale setting to @xmath1 theory at the one loop level .",
    "if one works with separate couplings for every term appearing in the lagrangian , including the kinetic term , the effective action is [ scalars ] = d^4x ( ( ) ^2- ^2-^4 ) with two fields @xmath23 and @xmath0 .",
    "the couplings @xmath26 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are functions of the field @xmath0 .",
    "this implies an equation of motion for @xmath47 : [ eomphi ] _",
    "( _ k ^)+ m^2_k ^+ ^3=0 and an other equation of motion for @xmath0 : [ eomkphi ] _ k ( ) ^2- ( m^2_k) ^2- g_k ^4=0 , where @xmath48 .",
    "the conserved energy momentum tensor is obtained as variation with respect to the metric tensor [ tmunuphi ] t_=_k ( _ ) ( _ ) - g _ ( ( ) ^2- ^2-^4 ) .",
    "the corresponding conservation law reads [ const ] 0&=&^t _ + & = & ^(_k _ ) _ + _ k ( _ ) ^_-_(_k()^2- m^2_k ^2-^4 ) + & = & -(_k ( ) ^2- ( m^2_k) ^2- g_k ^4 ) _ k , where in the second line the @xmath23 equation of motion ( [ eomphi ] ) was used .",
    "one easily observes that ( [ const ] ) is identical to the equation of motion for @xmath0 ( [ eomkphi ] ) .",
    "this shows that the approach at the level of effective action ( [ eomgen ] ) is on the one hand implementing the idea of minimal scale dependence and on the other hand maintaining the validity of improved equations of motion and the fundamental conservation law ( see section [ sec : imp ] )",
    ".    instead of writing a coupling for the kinetic term one frequently works with wave function renormalization where the bare field is @xmath49 . in this case",
    "one could simply identify @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 and observe that the corresponding effective action is completely equivalent to ( [ scalars ] ) .",
    "however , if one allows for field valued scales @xmath53 , this identification is not the only possibility , since the derivatives of the kinetic term , acting on the scale field might contribute to the action .",
    "still , even in this case it can be shown that the scale setting procedure is consistent with the conservation law , just like in ( [ const ] ) .",
    "the loop expansion of @xmath1 theory has been calculated up to high order in perturbation theory  @xcite . for the following example",
    "will be restricted to the one - loop expansion of the beta functions ( see  @xcite ) _ z & = & = 0 , + _ g & = & = g_k^2 , + _ m^2 & = & = ( - 2 + ) m_k^2 .",
    "now one can integrate those flow equations with initial conditions for @xmath20 [ initialk0 ] z_k_01 g_k_0= g_0 m^2_k_0=m^2_0 .",
    "this determines the particular flow trajectory [ scal1loopcouplpesk ] z_k&=&1 , + g_k&= & , + m^2_k&= & = ( ) ^1/3 .",
    "in order to maintain legibility , the subscript of the scale dependent couplings will be omitted ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) in the following calculation . due to the constant wave function renormalization , the equation of motion for @xmath23 simplifies to [ eomphisimppesk ] ^2 + m^2 + ^3=0 and the scale setting equation of motion ( [ eomkphi ] ) simplifies to [ eomphikpesk ] ^3 g + 12 ( m^2) = 0 .",
    "the two equations of motion ( [ eomphisimppesk ] ) and ( [ eomphikpesk ] ) have to be solved for the two functions @xmath0 and @xmath23 .",
    "one way to approach this , is to first solve ( [ eomphikpesk ] ) as non - differential equation for @xmath43 giving [ phisol ] ^2=4 ( ) ^(1/3 ) .",

    "will now be exemplified for a specific system :    for static spherical symmetry the only allowed coordinate dependence is with respect to the radial distance @xmath57 . in this case ( [ eomkdiffpesk ] ) reads [ eomkdiffpeskrad ] k_0 ^ 2 m_0 ^ 2 ( 64 ^2 - 3 g_0 - 56 g_0 ( k / k_0 ) ) - 6 g_0 ( _ r k)^2 + ( 2 r _",
    "r k+ r^2 _ r^2 k ) = 0 . due to the non - trivial structure of the differential operator it is hard to find a general solution of ( [ eomkdiffpeskrad ] ) but",
    "one observes that , if @xmath58 , this equation has actually a constant solution , [ kii ] k_i = k_0 ( -+ ) . from this expression",
    "one finds that demanding that @xmath59 would imply @xmath60 , which is clearly not in the validity range of the small @xmath56 approximation .",
    "thus , it is safe to say that @xmath61 .",
    "one can now investigate the scale setting in the vicinity of this constant scale @xmath62 [ sepak ] k(r)=k_i + k(r)+(k^2 ) . inserting this in ( [ eomkdiffpeskrad ] ) and expanding to first order in @xmath63",
    "one obtains a simpler differential equation for the radial dependence of the scale - field 56 m_0 ^ 2 r k-3 ( 2 _ r k + r_r^2 k)=0 .",
    "this differential equation can be directly solved by k(r)= ( -2 m_0 r ) + ( + 2 m_0 r ) , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the constants of integration .",
    "they have to be set by additional conditions , for example one might impose that @xmath63 does not diverge for large radii , which implies that @xmath66 .",
    "the scale - field setting is then [ krsol ] k(r)=k_i + ( -2 m_0 r ) .",
    "one notes that ( [ krsol ] ) actually reproduces the standard @xmath67 behavior for very small radii , but it has two additional features with respect to the naive guess .",
    "the first difference consists in the constant factor , which might be suppressed for the case of a small scale @xmath10 in the initial conditions ( [ initialk0 ] ) .",
    "the second difference is an exponential suppression factor which is controlled by the mass @xmath68 and by the value of @xmath56 . in figure",

    "please note that the exercise was made in order to study the scale setting @xmath73 and that in a more complete analysis , also the stability and the finiteness of the corresponding solution for @xmath74 has to be studied .",
    "in order to show the consistency of the proposed scale setting , with conservation laws in a less - trivial example , one can study the approach for gravity coupled to a @xmath75 gauge field and to a cosmological constant .",
    "gravity is exemplary for a non - trivial field theory that is notoriously perturbatively not renormalizable and the situation becomes even less favorable when it is coupled to matter .",
    "still , there exist non - perturbative methods that allow to calculate effective actions and scale dependent couplings for this theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to investigate the proposed scale setting procedure in the context of a gravitational action coupled to matter .",
    "as example for such a coupled gravitational system the einstein - hilbert - maxwell action will be discussed @xmath76&=&\\int_{m }   d^4 x   \\sqrt{-g}\\left(\\frac{r-2\\lambda _ { k}}{16\\pi g _ { k}}-\\frac{1}{4 e_{k}^2}f_{\\mu \\nu}f^{\\mu \\nu}\\right ) \\quad , \\label{ehaction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the ricci scalar and @xmath78 is the antisymmetric electromagnetic field strength tensor .",
    "the scale dependent couplings are thus , newtons coupling @xmath79 , the cosmological coupling @xmath80 , and the electromagnetic coupling @xmath81",
    ". please note that the flow of those couplings has been derived non - perturbatively in @xcite . as in ( [ pres ] ,",
    "[ eomgen ] ) the scale @xmath82 will be considered as field without kinetic term .",
    "the equations of motion for the metric field in ( [ ehaction ] ) are @xmath83 where the possible coordinate dependence of @xmath79 induces an additional contribution to the stress - energy tensor @xcite t_=g _ k(g_- _ _ ) .",
    "further , the stress - energy tensor for the electromagnetic part is given by t_=f_^ f_- g _ f_f^. the equations of motion ( maxwell equations ) for this @xmath75 gauge field are [ eoma ] d _ ( f^)=0 , and finally the equations of motion for the scale - field @xmath0 are [ eomk ] ( ^k ) = 0 .",
    "the above equations of motion are complemented by the relations corresponding to gauge invariance of the system . for the case of diffeomorphism invariance one",

    "please note that one has to work with ( [ maxwhom ] ) and not with @xmath84}=0 $ ] since the factor @xmath85 appears explicitly in the action ( [ ehaction ] ) and not in the covariant derivatives .",
    "the new ingredient due to the scale - field is the equation ( [ eomk ] ) , therefore it is important to check whether this equation is actually non - trivial and consistent with the equations ( [ eomg ] and [ eoma ] ) .",
    "the consistency can be shown by explicitly deriving ( [ eomk ] ) from ( [ eomg ] and [ eoma ] ) and further imposing that the gauge symmetries reflected by ( [ diffeo ] and [ maxwhom ] ) are maintained .",

    "thus , one has 0=(^ k ) . since in this proof , there has no scale setting @xmath90 been applied yet , one can choose any direction for the vector @xmath91 and still the above relation has to hold .",
    "the only non - trivial way for this to happen is that the quantity in squared brackets has to vanish . tracing this quantity over its two indices",
    "one gets 0= 2 + + 4 ( ( e_k^-2) f^2 ) , which is indeed identical to ( [ eomk ] ) .",
    "therefore , the equation of motion ( [ eomk ] ) is indeed consistent with the other equations of motion of the system ( [ eomg ] and [ eoma ] ) in combination with the symmetry relations ( [ diffeo ] and [ maxwhom ] ) .",
    "this consistency does not guarantee that the system has physically reasonable and non - trivial solutions .",
    "but it confirms again that , even for gauge and gravitational systems , the approach at the level of effective action ( [ eomgen ] ) is on the one hand an elegant way of minimizing scale setting ambiguities and on the other hand maintaining the validity of improved equations of motion and the fundamental conservation laws of the effective action ( see section [ sec : imp ] ) .",

    ", the method ( [ pres ] ) can actually be used in order to construct a scale - independent effective action @xmath92 , by integrating out @xmath38 of the scale dependent action @xmath2 . in a general setting one proceeds by first solving the equation of motion for @xmath0 in momentum space = _ , giving @xmath93 .",

    "other trajectories either run into a landau pole type of divergence at finite k , or they run to vanishing values of @xmath97 at infinite @xmath0  @xcite [ uve1 ] _ k(k^2)^b . the value of the exponentiating factor @xmath98 for the second fixed point depends on the method of calculation . since the numerical value of @xmath98 ranges from @xmath99 to @xmath100  @xcite , in this example the simplest possibility of @xmath101 will be chosen .",
    "the behavior of this flow projection using the functions of  @xcite is shown in figure [ fig : eg ] .",
    "coupling flow projected to the dimensionless gravitational coupling @xmath102 and the electromagnetic coupling @xmath103 .",
    "the arrows point in direction of increasing @xmath0.,width=377 ]    one observes three fixed points in this flow : apart from the gaussian fixed point at vanishing couplings one sees , one fixed point with finite @xmath104 but vanishing @xmath103 ( labeled @xmath105 ) , which corresponds to the limit ( [ uve1 ] ) , and an other fixed point with finite @xmath104 and @xmath103 ( labeled @xmath106 ) , which corresponds to the limit ( [ uve ] ) . in order to integrate out the scale - field from the effective action ( [ ehaction ] ) one has to solve the corresponding equation of motion ( [ eomk ] ) for @xmath82 . in the uv limit ( [ uvgl ] )",
    "one finds for the fixed point in ( [ uve ] ) [ ss2 ] k^2_2|_uv = and for the asymptotic behavior ( [ uve1 ] ) one finds in the same limit [ ss1 ] k^2_1|_uv=. those field - scale settings relate the uv scale @xmath82 proportional to the curvature scalar @xmath77 , in agreement to what is frequently intuited in the literature @xcite .",
    "but the relations ( [ ss2 ] , [ ss1 ] ) go beyond this intuition since they also determine the constant proportionality factor and possible modifications due to the electromagnetic field strength .",
    "now follows the `` integrating out '' ( [ intoutcond ] ) , where the scale - field is eliminated from the original action .",
    "the effective actions valid in the deep uv are obtained , from ( [ ehaction ] ) after using again the approximation ( [ uvgl ] ) . for the fixed point in ( [ uve ] ) and",
    "the corresponding scale setting ( [ ss2 ] ) this gives _",
    "uv,2=d^4x . for the asymptotic behavior ( [ uve1 ] ) and the corresponding scale setting ( [ ss1 ] ) the uv effective action results to be [ tildegamma ] _",
    "one observes that for vanishing @xmath107 , the @xmath108 dependence of the uv effective action in asymptotic safe gravity , which is indeed renormalizable  @xcite , is recovered in agreement with other studies in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , in addition to this expectable result , the scale - field procedure in combination with integrating out the additional @xmath0-field dependence , allowed to predict a generalization of those results to the coupling to a finite electromagnetic field strength @xmath109 .",
    "those uv results confirm that the fixed points ( [ uve ] ) and ( [ uve1 ] ) correspond to different physical systems with different effective equations of motion for the background .",
    "therefore , the uv behavior of the self - consistent background , which is solution of one of those equations of motion , can be largely different for different trajectories , depending on the fixed point which is approached by a specific trajectory in the rg flow ( see figure [ fig : eg ] ) .",
    "in this paper the problem of scale setting in the context of finding self - consistent solutions of the effective action - `` gap equations '' was discussed .",
    "first , the procedure of improving solutions for non - perturbative problems was reviewed by the use of a quite generic example .",
    "it was shown that one might define a scale setting ( [ commutesetting ] ) that keeps consistency at the level of improved equations of motion , but it was also shown that usually the conservation of the stress - energy tensor can not be guaranteed throughout the improving solutions procedure .",
    "then , in section [ sec : ssproposed ] a novel procedure for the scale setting is proposed , by promoting the scale @xmath0 to a scale - field @xmath38 at the level of effective action @xmath110 . this proposal is the essential idea of the presented work .    in order to demonstrate the functionality of the new procedure , the following sections are devoted to discuss the approach for emblematic field theories . as first example scalar @xmath1 theory is discussed and the consistent conservation of the stress - energy tensor , even after the scale setting , is shown explicitly .",
    "the self - consistency is shown for two common forms of the @xmath1 effective action . in order to complement this general result , by a more practical example , an approximated self - consistent scale setting for spherically symmetric backgrounds in @xmath1 theory is calculated at the one loop level .    in its generality",
    "the scale - field method is not limited to the simple scalar @xmath1 model .",
    "instead it is expected to work for a very broad class of theories .",
    "for example , it also is meant to work in the context of much richer gauge theories .",
    "this much broader applicability is exemplified by studying the scale setting prescription in gravity coupled to an electromagnetic stress - energy tensor , represented by einstein - hilbert - maxwell theory .",
    "it is explicitly shown that also in this example the conservation of a generalized stress - energy tensor is guaranteed by the scale - field setting . as application , the uv scale - field setting of asymptotically safe gravity coupled to an electromagnetic field strength",
    "is calculated and the scale independent effective action ( valid in the uv ) of this theory is derived by integrating the scale - field out .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that the idea is not limited to background calculations , but it should also be applicable to scale setting problems in scattering theory in the conventional feynman sense .",
