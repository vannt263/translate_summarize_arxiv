    "a powerful concept that threads the spin liquid phase in both its classical and quantum forms is that of spin chirality , specifically the scalar spin chirality . originally proposed as a tool to characterize a novel time - reversal symmetry - broken ground state of high-@xmath0 cuprates  @xcite , it is formed from the configuration of three neighboring spins @xmath1 at the @xmath2 sites by their triple product @xmath3 .",
    "it is odd , by construction , under the time - reversal operation that takes the spin @xmath4 to its negative , @xmath5 , and has zero average value for states that respect the time - reversal symmetry .    for the magnetically disordered state",
    "where @xmath6 , one might conclude that spin chirality must also be zero , @xmath7 , by virtue of the mean - field argument .",
    "this is not always the case , however , and one good way to identify a spin liquid is as a spin - disordered phase in which the chirality remains ordered , or at least have a much more extended correlation length than is expected in the uncorrelated , paramagnetic state .    in this review",
    "we will take look at the spin chirality from a pragmatic vantage point , focusing on experimentally accessible consequences of spin states with significant amount of spin chirality order or correlations .",
    "specifically we are going to focus on insulating magnets where conduction electrons as carriers of energy and spin are absent and the sole transport carriers are the spins .",
    "a number of recent experiments have found thermal hall conductivity in insulating magnets with ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic couplings , in both ordered and disordered regimes of the phase space  @xcite . some of these materials have the ferromagnetic ground state  @xcite , others are believed to be in the quantum spin ice phase  @xcite or in the spin liquid phase  @xcite .",
    "we will outline a linear - response formulation of the thermal transport suggesting that hall effects in purely spin systems must be closely tied to significant spin chirality correlations .",
    "often , the symmetry is broken and the spin chirality is reduced to a simpler order . for one , a non - coplanar spin order can give @xmath8 purely from mean - field argument .",
    "under an applied magnetic field @xmath9 , scalar spin chirality turns into a vector spin chirality @xmath10 . despite the differences , we will allude to hall - like transport in all these systems as chirality - driven .",
    "recent rapid advances on skyrmion research  @xcite has spurred interests in magnon transport through the skyrmionic spin texture background  @xcite . since skyrmion is but a quantized form of spin chirality which acts as a source of emergent magnetic flux on the magnon particles , magnon transport in the skyrmion matter is an excellent example of chirality - driven spin transport phenomena which is gaining attention as a new frontier in magnonics  @xcite .",
    "the transport manifestation of the spin chirality can be pictured as follows .",
    "say a given cluster of spins fluctuate in such manner as to maintain a definite spin chirality .",
    "if one of the spins in that cluster is perturbed , the other two spins must be moved in some coordinated dance , such that the same spin chirality is maintained at all times . viewed from the apex of the three - spin umbrella",
    ", such a collective motion should appear as either clockwise or counter - clockwise rotation of the spin cluster around the umbrella s edge .",
    "there is a sense of vorticity built into such a constrained motion , which translates ultimately into a magnetic flux of emergent nature for the spin excitation .",
    "this kind of emergent magnetism can be manifested as the formation of topologically non - trivial bands of magnons  @xcite in the momentum space , or as localized emergent magnetic fields in real space  @xcite . while ideas of this sort have been around for some time now , what makes these concepts exciting now and warrants the writing of a review is the interesting breakthroughs that have taken place over the past few years , which have made them real and experimentally accessible concepts .",
    "we formulate the rest of the review by starting with a theory of thermally driven spin transport in purely spin systems and cascading down to the magnon picture by making mean - field approximations .",
    "contacts with many existing magnon - based theories of thermal hall transport can be established this way",
    ". then we will cover several exciting experiments that came out in the last few years in light of the theoretical picture . in the last phase of the review we discuss the real - space manifestation of the chirality - driven magnon dynamics in the context of skyrmion matter .",
    "a summary and perspective section is devoted to the very latest development on the experimental front and some speculations on the future of theory .",
    "we are concerned with developing a theory of spin transport in purely spin systems , mostly focused on , but by no means confined to magnetically ordered phases where magnons are the quasi - particle carriers of spin , energy , and possibly information itself .",
    "electrical currents in a conductor are generated by a voltage difference , irradiation by electromagnetic wave , and temperature or chemical potential gradients .",
    "spin excitations in insulating magnets are made possible by coupling to the electromagnetic wave , temperature gradient , and possibly the magnetization gradient .",
    "the generation of spin and heat currents has been successfully demonstrated by microwave  @xcite and temperature gradient@xcite techniques , calling for developments of theory of transport in magnetic insulators  @xcite . in this review",
    "we will be particularly concerned with spin transport in _ topological magnets _ , in which some form of topological effects influence the spin dynamics .",
    "there are several ways of developing a transport theory .",
    "one can start from the microscopic landau - lifshitz - gilbert dynamical equations and work one s way up to derive some phenomenological equations of magnons , as exemplified in the work of ref . . alternatively , there is a linear response approach set forth by kubo , in which the aim is to obtain transport coefficients directly from the underlying microscopic model .",
    "transport coefficients such as the thermal hall conductivity are written as integrals of some equilibrium - averaged physical quantities .",
    "we will discuss how the linear response approach can be applied to derive transport coefficients when the only physical degrees of freedom are spins",
    ".    in the linear response theory one ( i ) begins with a proper definition of the current operator for a given microscopic model , and ( ii ) identifies the classical source that couples to it . for the electronic system",
    "this is done by asking how the density operator at the site @xmath11 ( omitting spin indices ) @xmath12 evolves over time    @xmath13   = - \\sum_{j \\neq i } j_{i\\rightarrow j } .\\ ] ]    in all subsequent formulas we set @xmath14 .",

    "thus , by a straightforward application of the commutator algebra one obtains the current operator @xmath17 , which completes the task ( i ) of the linear response program .",
    "the spin current operator projected along , say , the @xmath18-direction can be deduced in the same way .",

    "understanding why these two putative quantum spin ice materials should show very different thermal responses is a challenging problem .",
    "recall that previous observations of thermal hall effects  @xcite in magnetic insulators were understood to originate from the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction in the model hamiltonian . on the face of it the quantum spin ice hamiltonian ( [ eq : qsi ] )",

    "the field is still growing at a rapid pace , with the ultimate hope of realizing a skyrmion - based spintronics device where each skyrmion can be created , destroyed , transported , detected , and manipulated individually . aside from device interests , an intrinsic physics tied to the emergent electromagnetism has attracted considerable attention  @xcite . in short ,",
    "it means that the spin texture of a skyrmion acts as a source of magnetic field @xmath145 ,    @xmath146    to the electrons whose spins are tightly locked to the localized moment through the hund s coupling .",

    "while an electron sees the skyrmion as carrying one unit of flux quantum , magnon sees it as roughly two units of quanta ( more on this point later ) .",

    "the first term for @xmath175 in eq . ( [ eq : a - to - n ] ) indeed suggests that a skyrmion is seen to carry two units of flux quanta for magnons .",

    "figure [ fig:9 ] shows the skewed trajectory of a magnon hitting off a skyrmion , taken from ref . .",
    "other works  @xcite identified a similar scattering process .",
    "the idea of emergent magnetic field for magnons can be carried over naturally to the skyrmion lattice . on average magnons",
    "would see the skyrmion lattice as uniform magnetic field and form landau levels .",
    "the inhomogeneous , but periodic part of the emergent field perturbs the landau level picture and gives rise to a set of dispersive bands carrying nonzero chern numbers  @xcite .",
    "a recent work has derived the magnon spectra in the bulk and the edge modes for the triangular lattice of skyrmion  @xcite .",
    "the thermal hall conductivity of magnons in the skyrmion background can then be calculated using the formula worked out in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kappa - mf ] )  @xcite .",
    "it will be possible , then , to observe magnon thermal hall effect in the insulating skyrmion crystal such as cu@xmath109oseo@xmath131  @xcite .",
    "the simple picture described above , however , does not take into account the  back action \" of the skyrmion in response to the magnon .",
    "as noted by several authors  @xcite , magnon current creates a skyrmion motion both against the magnon flow ( longitudinal back - action ) and perpendicular to it ( transverse back - action ) .",
    "the longitudinal part of the skyrmion back - action can be pictured as a horse racing on an extended treadmill . as the horse ( magnon )",
    "gallops forward , the treadmill ( skyrmion ) is pushed backwards in keeping with the momentum conservation .",
    "the spin transfer torque is mediating the exchange of momentum between the two parts of the spin system .",
    "measurement of the thermal conductivity in an insulating skyrmion crystal can be quite hard to interpret , in reality , due to the fact that both magnons and skyrmions will be set in motion in response to the thermal gradient .",
    "in particular the longitudinal part of the thermal transport seems to have one positive contribution from magnons flowing from high to low temperature ends , and another _ negative _ contribution from the skyrmions which move towards the higher temperature end of the contacts !    a smart way to avoid the complications of the longitudinal back - action of the skyrmion , and to focus sharply on the magnon hall transport in the skyrmion crystal , is to confine the skyrmions in a restricted geometry .",
    "a laser beam , for instance , can create a temperature gradient that points radially from the center of the laser spot where it would be hottest .",
    "the magnon current generated by the temperature gradient has a hall component because it sees the skyrmion lattice background as magnetic field , directed tangentially to the droplet .",
    "the tangential magnon flow will then  kick back \" the skyrmions and set them in a ferris wheel motion , and a feynman s ratchet will be realized .",
    "the ratchet motion of the skyrmion crystal beautifully observed in the lorentz tem experiment ( where the laser spot is replaced by an electron beam ) is interpreted in this way  @xcite , and amounts to the observation of magnon hall effect in the skyrmion crystal .",
    "it is amusing to speculate that the same novel phenomena we are discussing in the context of magnon - skyrmion scattering may arise in the phonon - vortex scattering in superfluids as well .",
    "the lagrangian for the vortex motion shares the same berry phase term as the skyrmion  @xcite .",
    "the ability to drive skyrmions by spin waves ( magnons ) is of importance from the practical importance as well .",
    "following the insightful suggestion in ref .",
    ", the authors of ref . considered the magnon - driven motion of skyrmion on a nano - sized strip whose width is a few times the skyrmion radius .",
    "interestingly , the skyrmion was driven forward by the magnon and not backwards as in refs . .",
    "somehow the confining potential of the nanostrip plays a role in the skyrmion motion as well .",
    "hall - like transport phenomena of spin excitations in insulating magnets have been reviewed with emphasis on  paramagnetic \" thermal hall effects seen in two - dimensional ferromagnetic insulator cu(2,1-bdc ) and putative quantum spin ice ti@xmath109ti@xmath109o@xmath110 .",
    "both cases showed a substantial thermal hall conductivity over temperatures significantly above the ordering temperature @xmath0 ( if ordering exists at all , in the case of ti@xmath109ti@xmath109o@xmath110 ) .",
    "formal theories of spin thermal transport without assuming magnetic order , hence different from the magnon picture , have been outlined .",
    "an attractive venue to look for spin thermal transport in the absence of magnetic order is the spin liquid insulator .",
    "thermal hall conductivity measurement on the triangular spin liquid material etme@xmath131sb[pd(dmit)@xmath109]@xmath109 did not show a discernible thermal hall signal  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "another candidate spin liquid material cu@xmath131v@xmath109o@xmath110(oh)@xmath1772h@xmath109o ( volborthite ) was recently found to have finite @xmath115 over the temperature region where significant spin - spin correlations exist  @xcite but no magnetic order is present .",
    "another promising candidate spin system to look for thermal hall effect is the antiferromagnetic insulator on a frustrated lattice ( e.g. kagome ) with dm exchange .",
    "the heisenberg exchange alone leads to planar spin order without spin chirality , but the addition of suitably chosen dm vector is known to ca nt the spins out of plane , leading to an umbrella - like structure that has finite spin chirality  @xcite .",
    "it is possible , according to known rules of classical statistical mechanics that ising order is harder to destroy than a continuous one , to have a phase where the long - range antiferromagnetic order is destroyed but the ising - like spin chirality order survives .",
    "such will be a phase in which time - reversal symmetry remains spontaneously broken , where one can expect the thermal hall effect without applying the magnetic field .",
    "a recent report  @xcite of the spin - canted order in the antiferromagnetic insulator in nd@xmath131sb@xmath131mg@xmath109o@xmath178 , in which nd @xmath179 moments sitting on kagome sites were found to be in a canted antiferromagnetic phase , is a promising material avenue to look for  spontaneous \" thermal hall effect in the paramagnetic regime . a large canting angle and",
    "the estimate of a large dm interaction @xmath180 , together with a significant amount of spin - spin correlations observed above the neel temperature , further suggests that a thermally driven spin liquid phase may well exist in this material .",
    "observation of the thermal hall signal in such a phase would further highlight the spin - chirality origin of thermal transport in magnetic insulators .    on the theoretical front , calculation of the fully spin - based thermal hall conductivity formula ( [ eq : full - kappa - e ] ) , without the recourse to mean - field theory , will be challenging but interesting to carry out .",
    "even the classical simulation of spin dynamics can give the thermal hall coefficient through the well - known green - kubo formula  @xcite        we also reviewed the chirality - driven magnon transport phenomena in the syrmionic matter .",
    "emergent gauge field induced by the non - trivial spin background results in the local chirality functioning as the magnetic field .",
    "consequently , the itinerant magnon feels the emergent magnetic field , resulting in such phenomena as the skew scattering off a localized skyrmion and hall - like thermal transport . a three - dimensional analogue of the skyrmion - driven hall effect can take place if the magnon band structure assumes the weyl form , with a linear dispersion around points in the three - dimensional brillouin zone and a non - zero monopole number . an interesting proposal for weyl magnons and the thermal hall effect in such system",

    "<S> experimental and theoretical aspects of hall - type transport of spins in magnetic insulators are reviewed , with emphasis on their spin chirality origin . </S>",
    "<S> a general formalism for linear response theory of thermal hall transport in the spin model is developed , which can be applied to both the magnon and the paramagnetic , spin - liquid regimes . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments on magnon - mediated thermal hall transport in the two - dimensional kagome , and three - dimensional pyrochlore ferromagnetic insulators are reviewed in light of the multi - band magnon theory of hall transport , and compared to the more mysterious thermal hall transport found in the putative quantum spin ice material . </S>",
    "<S> as realizations of spin - chirality driven magnon transport in the real space , we review the general theory of emergent gauge fields governing the magnon dynamics in the textured magnet , and discuss its application to the magnon - skyrmion scattering problem . </S>",
    "<S> topological magnon hall effect driven by the skyrmion texture is discussed . </S>"
