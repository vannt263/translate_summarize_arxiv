    "since their discovery in 1991 @xcite , carbon nanotubes have attracted massive attention from both experimental and theoretical physicists .",
    "their remarkable mechanical and electronic properties , extreme mechanical strength @xcite , and elasticity @xcite as well as conductivity @xcite make their use in future electronic devices very promising @xcite .",
    "carbon nanotubes are also relevant as a low - dimensional test field of fundamental physical theories . for instance , the klein tunneling , a well known phenomenon in relativistic quantum theory @xcite , has not been observed for elementary particles so far . however , it was predicted and observed in carbon nanotubes where it stays behind the absence of backscattering on impurities @xcite .",
    "the single - wall carbon nanotubes are small cylinders with atom - thick shells , that can be created by rolling up graphene nanoribbons @xcite . despite their structural simplicity ( as quasi one - dimensional objects ) ,",
    "the nanotubes exhibit a remarkable variety of electronic properties",
    ". they can be either metallic or semiconducting , depending on the orientation of the hexagonal lattice in the nanotube .",
    "the gap between the valence and conduction band can be regulated by either external fields @xcite or by mechanical deformations @xcite .",
    "this paves the way to strain engineering @xcite where graphene - based devices would be fine - tuned by deformations .    in the present paper",
    ", we will consider a class of exactly solvable models of single - wall carbon nanotubes subject to radial twist ( axial torsion ) .",
    "the systems will be studied in the low - energy regime where the dynamics of charge carriers is well approximated by a @xmath0-dimensional dirac equation @xcite .",
    "in particular , the twist configurations under investigation will be described by a finite - gap hamiltonian .    besides the analysis of the spectral properties",
    ", the computation of the local density of states ( ldos ) of the systems will be addressed .",
    "this quantity is measurable by means of scanning tunneling microscopy experiments @xcite and is very important for the specification of the electronic properties of nanostructures .",
    "when integrated spatially , it provides the density of states ( dos ) that reflects the probability of inserting an electron at given energy into the system .    in general , it is a rather complicated task to analytically compute the local density of states .",
    "however , as it was suggested in @xcite and demonstrated later in @xcite , the computation can be considerably simplified for a broad class of dirac and bogoliubov - de gennes hamiltonians that are characterized by a finite number of gaps in the spectrum .",
    "this approach is based on the intrinsic properties of the finite - gap systems that arise from the stationary akns ( ablowitz - kaup - newell - segur ) hierarchies of integrable systems @xcite .    in the next section",
    ", we will set up the theoretical framework in which the twisted nanotubes will be analyzed .",
    "it will be explained how the dirac hamiltonian emerges in the description of twisted carbon ( and boron - nitride ) nanotubes . in sec .",
    "[ aknsldos ] , the relevant points of the construction of the akns hierarchies are summarized and the closed formula for the ldos is discussed . section [ examples ] is devoted to the presentation of explicit examples of carbon and boron - nitride nanotubes where the ldos and dos will be computed explicitly",
    ". we will show in sec .",
    "[ susy ] that the singular points of dos , so - called van hove singularities , are closely related to the nonlinear supersymmetry that arises naturally for the nanotubes with finite - gap twists and conserved time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the last section is left for the discussion and outlook .",
    "carbon atoms have four valence electrons ; three of them are tightly bound in the interatomic bonds while the fourth one is free and can contribute to the electronic properties of the crystal .",
    "the properties of the collective excitations of these electrons in graphene are well described by the tight - binding hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the interactions between the nearest neighbors are only assumed , being specified by a constant hopping parameter .",
    "the spin degree of freedom of electrons can be neglected ; it is irrelevant in the considered interactions .",
    "the analysis of the band structure displays the specific feature of graphene : the fermi surface is formed by six discrete points where valence and conduction bands meet .",
    "they are located at the corners of the hexagonal first brillouin zone and are called dirac points .",
    "only two of them are inequivalent and correspond to different electronic states .",
    "let us denote them as @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in the close vicinity of the dirac points , the energy surface acquires conelike shape .",
    "it suggests that the dispersion relation is linear in this region . indeed , taking @xmath3 with @xmath4 and expanding the tight - binding hamiltonian up to the terms linear in @xmath5",
    ", we get the stationary equation for the two - dimensional massless dirac particle @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian acquires the same form in both valleys of @xmath1 and @xmath6 . in the coordinate representation",
    ", we have .",
    "@xmath7 where @xmath8 is energy and @xmath9 the fermi velocity of the quasi - particle . ] @xmath10 the spinorial degree of freedom in ( [ singlevalleyhd ] ) , the pseudospin , arises due to the two carbon atoms in the elementary cell ; the hexagonal lattice can be thought of as assembled from two triangular lattices .",
    "the spin - up or down components of the wave functions are non - vanishing only on one of the two triangular sublattices .",
    "the operator @xmath11 acts on the spinors @xmath12 , while @xmath13 on the spinors @xmath14 . here",
    ", the first index denotes the valley , the second distinguishes between the sublattices @xmath15 and @xmath16 and @xmath17 denotes transposition .",
    "the formula ( [ singlevalleyhd ] ) was introduced already in 1984 by semenoff @xcite and makes the basis for considering the condensed matter system as a convenient test field for a low - dimensional quantum field theory .",
    "indeed , it makes it possible to observe phenomena in this condensed matter system that are native in high - energy quantum physics , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a single - wall carbon nanotube is rolled up from a straight graphene strip .",
    "the actual orientation of the hexagonal lattice in the strip is uniquely determined by the chiral ( circumference ) vector @xmath18 , which is a linear combination of the translation vectors of the lattice @xcite .",
    "its length corresponds to the diameter of the nanotube .",
    "we can fix the coordinates such that @xmath19 goes in the circumference direction .",
    "then the chiral vector gets the simple form , @xmath20 .",
    "the effect of rolling up the strip is reflected by the periodic boundary condition imposed on the wave functions , @xmath21 .",
    "it leads to the quantization of the momentum in the circumference direction which acquires discrete values @xmath22 . in the low - energy approximation ,",
    "only the value of @xmath22 that minimizes the energy is relevant .",
    "the system is then governed by a truly one - dimensional hamiltonian @xmath23 . the actual value of this fixed @xmath22 depends on the character of the nanotube . instead of going into more details that can be found , for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite , let us notice that @xmath24 corresponds to metallic nanotubes as there is no gap in the spectrum .",
    "when @xmath25 , there is a small gap in the spectrum and the nanotube is semiconducting . for purposes of our current analysis",
    ", we can suppose that the nanotubes are metallic ( i.e. the angular momentum is vanishing , @xmath24 ) and are infinitely long .",
    "the latter approximation is rather reasonable due to the recent experiments where ultralong single - wall nanotubes were created @xcite .    up to now , we considered systems where neither external fields nor any strains were present . by deforming the crystal mechanically ,",
    "the interatomic distances in the lattice are modified .",
    "thus , the hopping parameter ceases to be constant and becomes position dependent .",
    "this leads to the appearance of gauge fields in the tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "it can be approximated in the low - energy limit by dirac operator with nonvanishing vector potential @xcite .",
    "we shall consider radial twist of the nanotubes .",
    "let us mention that both single - wall and multi - wall carbon nanotubes with radial twist were used in construction of nanoelectromechanical devices , e.g. single - molecule torsional pendulum @xcite , abacus - type resonators @xcite or even rotors @xcite .",
    "in these systems , the nanotube served as the torsional string that was twisted by deflection of small paddles attached to it ; see also @xcite for a brief review .",
    "the radial twist shifts the atoms in the lattice perpendicularly to the axis , preserving the tubular shape of the nanotube . the displacement is reflected by a deformation vector , which measures the difference between actual and equilibrium position of atoms .",
    "it can be written in our specific case as @xmath26 .",
    "we consider the situation where the displacement is smooth and small on the scale of the interatomic distance .",
    "then the interaction does not mix the valleys of @xmath1 and @xmath6 , and the system can be studied in the vicinity of one dirac point only .",
    "the stationary equation for low energy dirac fermions in the @xmath1-valley acquires the following simple form @xcite , @xcite , @xmath27 where the vector potential @xmath28 reflects the twist .",
    "it is related to the displacement vector by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a constant dependent on the crystal characteristics .",
    "where @xmath17 is the hopping parameter and @xmath31 is the lattice constant .",
    "see @xcite for more details . ] in this framework , the constant vector potential @xmath32 would reflect a linear displacement @xmath33 .",
    "finally , let us consider the following generalization of ( [ eq1 ] ) , where a mass term is included , @xmath34 the analogue of ( [ singlevalleyhd ] ) with the mass term @xmath35 was proposed by semenoff for description of the quasiparticles in the boron - nitride crystal in the low - energy approximation @xcite .",
    "the boron - nitride crystal has the same hexagonal structure as graphene .",
    "however , the atoms in the elementary cell of the crystal cease to be equivalent .",
    "it gives rise to the potential term with @xmath36 that distinguishes between the two triangular sublattices @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we will consider ( [ eq1 m ] ) as the hamiltonian of radially twisted carbon ( @xmath37 ) or boron - nitride ( @xmath38 ) , depending on the value of @xmath35 , nanotubes .",
    "boron - nitride nanotubes were studied theoretically and observed experimentally , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite .",
    "contrary to the carbon nanotubes , they are always semiconducting .",
    "we shall consider the scenario where the term @xmath39 in ( [ eq1 m ] ) belongs to the broad class of the finite - gap potentials . in the next section",
    ", we will show how the peculiar properties of finite - gap systems can be utilized for computation of the local density of states .",
    "we review here some properties of the integrable anks hierarchies associated with the dirac hamiltonian ( [ eq1 m ] ) .",
    "to explain more easily the main features , we use the following unitarily transformed hamiltonian , @xmath40 where @xmath41 . this form with diagonal derivative term , the bogoliubov - de gennes type hamiltonian ,",
    "is used frequently in the analysis of gross - neveu and nambu - jona - lasinio models @xcite , @xcite and will make the presentation more coherent with the specialized literature @xcite .",
    "the vector potential @xmath42 in ( [ h1 ] ) is called finite gap ( or algebro - geometric in the mathematical literature ) when it solves one of the equations from the stationary akns hierarchy of the nonlinear differential equations , namely akns@xmath43 .",
    "one of the most intriguing properties of the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) with a finite gap potential is manifested in its spectrum ; it consists of a finite number of bands @xcite , @xcite . the actual number of bands ( or gaps )",
    "is fixed by the akns@xmath43 equation solved by @xmath44 .",
    "the values of band - edge energies of a finite - gap system can be obtained in purely algebraic manner ; see @xcite .",
    "these features are intimately related with the existence of an integral of motion of the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) .",
    "nonperiodic finite - gap systems can be obtained as the infinite - period limit of the periodic ones . in this context , the nonperiodic systems are known as kink or kink antikink models in analogy with the soliton solutions in the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) hierarchy .",
    "another relevant feature of this class of models is that they can approximate very well any condensed matter systems described , in the low - energy approximation , by the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) with a generic periodic potential .",
    "the hamiltonian with a generic periodic potential has an infinite number of spectral gaps , the width of which decreases rapidly with the increasing absolute value of energy .",
    "hence , the spectrum of such system can be fitted well by a finite- gap one .",

    "the formulas for ldos and dos computed in the third section with the use of the formula ( [ poly ] ) have to be multiplied by four to get the correct form for the corresponding twisted nanotubes .",
    "indeed , we have to take into account the valley degeneracy that we discussed in this section , as well the double degeneracy of energy levels due to ( real ) spin@xmath239 of the particle that was neglected up this moment .",

    "however , in the second valley the finite - gap potential is violated in general by the changed sign of @xmath240 .",
    "curiously enough , we can still get a finite - gap configuration for each valley by the fine - tuning of the external field . as an example , let us consider the situation when the low - energy dynamics in the @xmath1 valley is described by @xmath243 which is an infinite - period limit of the three - gap system ( [ crystal2 ] ) .",
    "let us suppose that the vector potential in ( [ twistmg1 ] ) is induced both by radial twist and by external magnetic field , where @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",
    "then the subsystem in the @xmath246-valley is described by @xmath247 which is just the trivial one - gap system . in the current",
    "setting , deformation associated with @xmath183 is asymptotically uniform but gets changed in the localized region where the ( asymptotically vanishing ) external magnetic field is nonzero .",
    "the spectrum of the corresponding total hamiltonian @xmath188 has two singlet discrete energy levels corresponding to the bound states and two doubly degenerate levels @xmath248 corresponding to the threshold of the positive and negative continuum .",
    "the other energy levels are four - fold degenerate .",
    "it is worth noticing that the discussed framework can be understood in the context of ( planar ) graphene crystal in the presence of the external magnetic field and strain , both of which depend on @xmath249 only . due to separability of the stationary equation",
    ", the one - dimensional hamiltonian can be written as @xmath250 where @xmath22 corresponds to the momentum that is parallel with the ( pseudo- ) magnetic barrier .",
    "the operator ( [ plane ] ) describes a massless dirac particle that moves with fixed direction in the presence of vector potential @xmath251 , associated with the strain and the external magnetic field . in this context , the setting with the single - valley hamiltonians ( [ twistmg1 ] ) and ( [ twistmg2 ] ) with the inhomogeneous external magnetic field perpendicular to the surface and given by @xmath240 is rather realistic .",
    "the one - dimensional dirac operator with finite - gap potential appears in a variety of physically interesting models @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in the present paper , we illustrated how the machinery of the akns hierarchy can be used in the analysis of the twisted nanotubes in the low - energy regime , particularly , for the computation of the local density of states .",
    "we showed that the finite - gap , time - reversal invariant configurations possess a hidden nonlinear supersymmetry that is associated with the kramer s degeneracy of energy levels .",
    "physics of these systems , namely the presence of the two valleys at @xmath1 and @xmath6 and the preserved time - reversal symmetry , is responsible for the form of the hamiltonian ( [ totalh ] ) which consists of two copies of the ( unitarily ) equivalent single - valley energy operators .",
    "the current situation differs from the quantum models with bosonized supersymmetry @xcite , where a nonlocal integral of motion was identified as the grading operator .",
    "both the hamiltonian ( [ totalh ] ) and its integrals of motion ( [ q03 ] ) and ( [ set3 ] ) , forming @xmath203 lie algebra , can be graded by a local operator , e.g. by the valley index operator @xmath213 .",
    "this framework represents a nontrivial example of the hidden supersymmetry in the sense that it naturally emerges within the unextended , physical hamiltonian ( [ totalh ] ) .",
    "the explicit results for the presented finite - gap systems can be extended with the use of darboux transformation @xcite . within this framework",
    ", one can construct new finite - gap hamiltonians @xmath252 from a known one , namely @xmath253 .",
    "the transformation is given in terms of a matrix differential operator @xmath254 , which intertwines two one - dimensional dirac hamiltonians , @xmath255 .",
    "it maps the eigenstates of @xmath253 into those of @xmath252 , keeping the operators ( almost ) isospectral .",
    "moreover , the diagonal resolvent of @xmath252 can be computed directly from the diagonal resolvent of @xmath253 with the use of @xmath254 , see @xcite for details .    in the paper ,",
    "the operator ( [ eq1 m ] ) was almost exclusively interpreted as the effective hamiltonian of the twisted carbon ( or boron - nitride ) nanotube . as we discussed in the end of the preceding section",
    ", the results can be also used in the analysis of the dirac electrons in graphene in the presence of ( pseudo-)magnetic barriers . such systems with kronig - penney or a piece - wise constant ( pseudo- ) magnetic fields induced by either external field or strains were considered in the literature , see @xcite or @xcite . in this context , the dos computed for the twisted nanotubes can be interpreted as the partial density of states in graphene for the @xmath24 channel .",
    "it could facilitate the computation of the transition coefficient in the normal direction to the magnetic barrier .",
    "the known results @xcite on the relation between one - dimensional dos and the phase of the transmission amplitude could be particularly helpful in this context .",
    "considering dirac electrons in graphene , it is desirable to extend the analysis for @xmath25 as well .",
    "keeping in mind @xcite or @xcite , the infinite - period limit of the finite - gap models could be a feasible starting point in this respect .",
    "the analysis of periodic systems could make it possible to observe the phenomena that appear in graphene superlattices , the new generation of dirac points in particular @xcite , @xcite .",
    "study of the finite - gap configurations of electrostatic potential represents another possible direction for future research .",
    "spectral properties of dirac electron in graphene in presence of both periodic electrostatic and magnetic fields were discussed in various works , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in this context , the mapping between the systems with magnetic and electrostatic field @xcite could provide an interesting way to extend our results .",
    "the finite - gap systems are an approximation of more realistic settings .",
    "they can serve as a test field for numerical or perturbative methods and can also provide qualitative insight into the experimental data . although , to our best knowledge , the experiments with the single - wall carbon nanotubes with the periodically modulated twist have not been prepared yet , the building blocks of such settings seem to be available , see e.g. @xcite-@xcite .    as an experimental implementation of the proposed models",
    ", we can imagine a long suspended nanotube anchored to a substrate at the ends and a periodic array of small paddles attached to it .",
    "by deflection of the paddles , the twist of the nanotube could be altered .",
    "let us mention that the latter configuration ( with one paddle ) was employed in @xcite for measurement of the torsional properties of the nanotubes .",
    "in the presented finite - gap models , the possible interaction of the nanotube with the anchors and the paddles is not taken into account .",
    "still , we think that the results ( e.g. the suggested dependence of the central gap on the average twist ) might provide interesting qualitative insight into the spectral properties of the settings realized in the experiments .",
