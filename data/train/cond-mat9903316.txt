    "recently a population of neurons in the cat visual cortex has been reported to exhibit synchronized firings in a stimulus dependent manner@xcite .",
    "the occurrence of correlations in firing times of neurons seems to be a ubiquitous phenomenon in real nervous systems .",
    "the role of such synchronized firings for information processing in the brain has been attracting growing interest of researchers , and several authors have suggested neural network models based on the concept of temporal coding , where information of a neuron is represented by its firing times .",
    "indeed , to explain the experimental findings that visual information of an external object is processed with being divided into several pieces of information , several authors@xcite have suggested that the synchronized firings of neurons may serve as a linker for those pieces of information .",
    "the problem of investigating how an associative memory is realized in real nervous systems as well as of constructing biologically relevant models is of central concern of neuroscientists . since the establishment of systematic theories of associative memory for networks with an energy function that is ensured by assuming symmetric synaptic couplings@xcite , several attempts have been made to make models as biologically plausible as possible@xcite .",
    "previously we investigated the effects of asymmetric couplings@xcite for memorizing pre - synaptic and post - synaptic activities , which are incorporated into the standard symmetric hebb learning rule@xcite , by studying networks of analog neurons@xcite , whose continuous - time dynamics involves a positive - valued transfer function representing the mean firing rates of a neuron as a function of membrane potential .    instead of working with the concept of rate coding based on the idea that neuronal information is represented by mean firing rate of a single neuron , one",
    "may be concerned with the concept of temporal coding , when considering that spatio - temporal patterns of neuronal firings will make information carried by a population of neurons much richer than spatial patterns alone .",
    "a spiking neuron is considered to be one of the candidates for implementation of temporal coding@xcite .",
    "the time evolution of membrane potential that is generated in response to an injected synaptic electric current of a spiking neuron is described by such nonlinear dynamics as hodgkin - huxley equation@xcite , fitzhugh - nagumo equation@xcite , or the equation of an integrated - and - fire neuron . spiking neurons in a network",
    "are generally supposed to interact with each other via pulses generated in the firing events occurring in the pre - synaptic neuron .",
    "we have shown previously that even in the presence of time delays in transmission of the pulses an associative memory based on a network of spiking neurons can be realized by assuming a simple hebb - type learning rule alone , and that the memory retrieval accompanies synchronized firings of neurons .",
    "the dynamics of such associative memory was analyzed by means of sublattice method in our previous paper@xcite .    in the previous analysis@xcite we assumed that every neuron shares identical characteristics to exhibit the same reaction in response to the same injected current .",
    "in real nervous systems , however , neurons in a network may have their own individual characteristics .",
    "the problem of whether temporal coding functions robustly in the presence of certain heterogeneties of neurons will be of particular interest .",
    "for the purpose of investigating such a problem for the phenomenon of synchronized oscillations in associative memory neural networks , we consider it appropriate to deal with simple models of coupled oscillators with distributed natural frequencies and external noise .",
    "it is well known that , under certain conditions , a population of oscillators with distributed natural frequencies is allowed to get partially entrained in such a way that oscillators with a natural frequency near the central frequency become to oscillate synchronously at identical frequency as a result of cooperative interactions@xcite .",
    "kuramoto@xcite showed that the dynamics of this kind of network of oscillators with sufficiently week interactions can be reduced to a simple phase dynamics .",
    "supposing that neurons in a network are treated as phase oscillators , associative memory has been shown to be realized under a simple learning rule of the hebb - type either in the case of a finite number of stored patterns@xcite or in the case with a single natural frequency@xcite .",
    "satisfactory analysis of the case with a distribution of natural frequency and extensively many stored patterns has been far less conducted .",
    "quite recently we have reported the study of a deterministic phase oscillator network with a distribution of natural frequencies where an extensive number of binary patterns ( @xmath1 ) are stored with use of the hebb learning rule@xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the present study is the theoretical analysis of associative memory based on temporal coding with use of networks of phase oscillators in the more general case where the number of stored patterns that are given by uniformly distributed random numbers on @xmath0 is extensive , natural frequencies of the oscillators are distributed according to a certain distribution function , and furthermore external white noise is added to the system .    while one can analyze a phase oscillator network with a single natural frequency by means of the replica method that makes full use of its associated energy function",
    ", one can not resort any more to the standard method of statistical physics based on the existence of an energy function in the case of networks with a distribution of natural frequencies .",
    "one can , however , use the self - consistent signal - to - noise analysis ( scsna)@xcite to deal with general cases without energy functions . to apply the scsna it is necessary to know fixed - point equations describing the equilibrium states of the network .",
    "when considering such equations in stochastic systems , we may take advantage of the concept of the tap equation@xcite .",
    "the tap equation is known to exist for the sk model of spin glasses@xcite and the hopfield model of an ising spin neural networks@xcite , and to represent a functional relationship between the thermal or time average of each spin in equilibrium and its corresponding effective local field that involves the so called onsager reaction term@xcite .",
    "usefulness of the tap equation in deriving the order parameter equations of associative memory networks is attributed to the fact that the resulting equations of the replica calculations by ags is recovered by the result of application of the scsna to the tap equation@xcite , where the onsager reaction term is canceled exactly by the appearance of the renormalized output term of the scsna@xcite .",
    "we note that the tap equation of the naive mean field model with the interactions given by the hebb learning rule defines to an analog network equation with the transfer function @xmath2@xcite .",
    "we first evaluate an analogue of the tap equation of the naive mean field type for our model with a distribution of natural frequencies by dealing with the fokker - plank equation . in order to obtain the onsager reaction term",
    "we compute the free energy of the network without a distribution of natural frequencies to derive the tap equation by following the method of plefka@xcite and nakanishi@xcite .",
    "then we assume that the tap - like equation also exists with the onsager reaction term remaining the same even for networks with a distribution of natural frequencies , and that such tap - like equation defines an effective transfer function to which the scsna is applicable to obtain the order parameter equations .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section  [ model ]",
    "we introduce a neural network of simple phase oscillators and describe how the network functions as an associative memory based on a simple learning rule of the hebb - type . in section  [ derivation ]",
    "we give a theoretical analysis to derive the macroscopic order parameter equations describing the long time behavior of the system . on the basis of the order parameter equations , in section  [ application ] we investigate properties of memory retrieval accompanying synchronization in the networks by assuming a discrete symmetric natural frequency distribution with three frequency components .",

    "[ derivation ]    behaviors of associative memory networks depend crucially on the nature of the local fields or the neurons of oscillators , because the updating rule for the time evolution of the system is based on the local fields as is seen in eq .",

    "when the long time behavior of a network is described by fixed point type attractors , the relation between the resulting output state of a neuron and the corresponding local fields becomes essential for determining equilibrium properties of the networks .",

    "equilibrium fixed - point equations called the tap equations are known to exist as expressing the relation between time average of each output of a neuron and its corresponding effective local fields involving the so called onsager reaction term that is proportional to the time - averaged output .",
    "once the tap - like equation level description is available , the scsna , in which one compute the variance of the cross - talk noises in the local field as a result of storing an extensive number of patterns , can be applied to obtain the order parameter equations in the limit @xmath41 .",

    "the assumption of this form of the onsager reaction term yields @xmath131 , which leads to @xmath187 in eqs .",
    "( [ scm])-([scu ] ) .",
    "meanwhile the theoretical result we have obtained here is recovered by the tap - like equation evaluated by simply replacing the local fields @xmath185 in eq .",

    "note that , by use of this assumption , we can derive the order parameter equations without knowing the form of @xmath83 . in the present case",
    "both procedures give the same result , however , in some cases it seems that the later procedure gives the more accurate form of the transfer function .",
    "we will discuss details on this point somewhere else .",
    "some special cases of the present model have also been investigated by several authors other than cook .",
    "arenas et al .",
    "@xcite have investigated the case with @xmath39 , where the natural frequency distribution is assumed to obey a gaussian distribution .",
    "the result of this case can also be recovered by the present analysis .    to our knowledge",
    "the case with distributed natural frequencies and @xmath40 was first studied by park et al .",
    "@xcite for different synaptic couplings by means of replica calculations based on the energy that is defined so as to satisfy @xmath190 . in our case",
    "the @xmath191 takes the form @xmath192 .",
    "however this energy does not make any sense because the equilibrium distribution @xmath193 does not satisfy the periodical boundary condition @xmath194 .",
    "aonishi et al .",
    "@xcite studied the case with @xmath21 and a gaussian distribution for natural frequencies by considering that @xmath154 holds in the set of scsna eqs .",
    "based on a different scheme from ours even in the presence of the group of the desynchronized oscillators .",
    "yamana et al .  also studied the deterministic oscillator network ( @xmath21 ) with a discrete distribution of natural frequencies that stores binary patterns by making an approximation that the motions of the group of desynchronized oscillators do not exert an influence on the behavior of the synchronized oscillators .",
    "discarding the effect of desynchronized oscillators corresponds to considering the transfer function that takes the value zero inside the circle with radius @xmath164 ( see fig .  [ field ] ) . for a wide class of natural frequency distributions",
    "this scheme seems to work to a good approximation in the case with @xmath21 , because the contribution of the desynchronized oscillators to such order parameters as @xmath149 and @xmath86 is small .",
    "it is noted , however , that , in the case of @xmath42 , the phase of every oscillator with @xmath161 evolves with a certain non - zero time - averaged velocity and hence one can not distinguish between synchronized and desynchronized oscillators .",
    "accordingly for stochastic networks with @xmath42 methods based on neglecting the effect of the desynchronized oscillators will not make sense and one has to deal with all of the oscillators equally as in the present analysis .    finally , we briefly discuss the relevance of our results to biologically related models of associative memory .",
    "biologically relevant models@xcite should be based on such spiking neurons as the hodgkin - huxley type@xcite and integrate - and - fire type neurons@xcite .",
    "a simple integrate - and - fire neuron that is defined by 1-dimensional linear equation except for firing event can be described in terms of phase that is obtained by properly scaling the 1-dimensional output variable .",
    "synaptic couplings implimented into spiking neural networks are often assumed to incorporate the so called alpha function@xcite or its variant represented by the dynamics of a certain gating variable@xcite .",
    "so , major differences between the simple phase oscillator model we have dealt with on the basis of the diffusive couplings among the oscillators and the spiking model will be the form of the synaptic couplings together with symmetry of an individual oscillator with respect to rotation of the phase variable . while the present model is assumed to take a sinusoidal phase interaction for simplicity , a spiking model with a synaptic interaction based on the alpha function takes the form of pulse like couplings@xcite , which will lead to considering higher harmonics in the phase interaction .",
    "a spiking neural network model of associative memory we previously studied using fitzhugh - nagumo neurons exhibits a nearly comparable size of the storage capacity to that of the standard analog network with the transfer function @xmath195 that is larger than the storage capacity of the present model@xcite .",
    "it will then be of interest to observe the outcome of introducing higher harmonics in the phase interaction of the simple phase oscillator model .",
    "we expect the storage capacity of the phase oscillator network to increase when the higher harmonics is taken into account .",
    "such analysis is now under way .",
    "the problem of investigating properties of neurons synchronizing the envelope of a burst of spikes is also of interest , but is beyond the scope of the present paper , which aims studying the effects of such heterogeneities as a natural frequency distribution and external noise on the robustness of temporal coding in the oscillator network of associative memory .",
    "we consider that taking not only phase but also amplitude as variables for oscillatory neurons will provide a solvable model suitable for studying the case with such synchronization in networks of bursting neurons , which is also under way .",
