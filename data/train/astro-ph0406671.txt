    "white dwarfs ( wds ) are the final stage of stellar evolution for the vast majority of stars .",
    "wds are known to exist in open clusters with main - sequence turnoff masses of @xmath2 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and may have progenitors with zero - age main sequence masses as large as @xmath3 . however , the wd population of the shows a deficit of wds compared with the number that would be expected given the present - day mass function and reasonable assumptions for the shape of the initial - mass function ( imf ) @xcite , and no hyades wds have inferred progenitor masses @xmath4 ( claver et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter * ? ? ?",
    "there are at least three explanations for this white dwarf deficit .",
    "first , the `` missing '' wds may be hidden in unresolved binary star systems .",
    "a calculation of the number of hidden wds finds that this can explain many , but not all , of the missing wds ( williams 2004 , hereafter * ? ? ?",
    "second , dynamical evolution of the open cluster may remove wds from the cluster @xcite .",
    "this effect is enhanced if the wds receive a velocity `` kick '' during the mass - loss phase of the progenitor star @xcite .",
    "third , the higher - mass end of the initial - mass function ( imf ) in the hyades may have been steeper than commonly - observed imfs , lacking stars with @xmath5 .    in part to address this issue , @xcite studied the wd population of the praesepe open cluster .",
    "praesepe has an age ( @xmath6 myr ) and metallicity ( @xmath7 ) indistinguishable from that of the hyades @xcite .",
    "praesepe has a total mass of @xmath8 and a half - mass radius @xmath9 pc @xcite , more massive and more compact than the hyades , which has a total mass @xmath10 and a half - mass radius of @xmath11 pc @xcite , so losses of wds due to dynamical evolution should be less in praesepe than in the hyades .    in praesepe",
    ", @xcite found one wd with a massive progenitor , = , @xmath12 , and four wds with less - massive progenitors .",
    "four other praesepe wd candidates were not observed spectroscopically in that study due to their faintness ; two of these ( and ) have photometric properties consistent with cluster membership , a large wd mass and a progenitor mass @xmath13 .",
    "if these objects are indeed cluster member wds , they would be useful objects for exploring the value of @xmath14and would mostly resolve the praesepe wd deficit at these higher masses @xcite .",
    "as part of our ongoing study of open cluster wds , we have obtained spectra of these four objects .",
    " 2 details the observations and spectroscopic identifications of each object , and  3 discusses the implications of this study .",

    "[ spectra.fig ] .",
    "as can be seen , none of the four objects are wds ; all are qsos .",
    "redshifts for the qsos were determined by cross - correlating the object spectrum with the sdss composite qso spectrum of @xcite using the _ fxcor _ package in _",

    "the coordinates for this object in simbad and @xcite are from @xcite ; however , the object at these coordinates is not a blue object but a k star . in order to find any nearby blue objects , we blinked the blue and red second - generation digitized sky survey plates from the eso online dss server .",
    "a point source @xmath20 west of the given coordinates stands out as being far bluer than anything else in the field .",
    "a spectrum of the blue source obtained at magellan reveals it to be a qso .",
    "we therefore identify this blue object as lb 6037 and give these coordinates in table [ ids.tab ] .",

    "was identified by @xcite as a proper motion member of praesepe , though it is actually a qso .",
    "as quasars have zero proper motion , this is an obvious error in the proper motion measurement .",
    "measurements of `` significant '' proper motions for qsos have been noted in a cross - correlation of the usno - b and sdss catalogs @xcite and merely illustrate the difficulty in measuring small proper motions of faint objects .",
    "any conclusions about the praesepe wd population will depend on the completeness of the wd candidate lists .",
    "clbk01 do not discuss the completeness of their sample .",
    "they also included a few previously known wd candidates outside their survey area ( outlined in figure 4 ) .",
    "however , the clbk01 photometry is complete to @xmath22 , more than 1 mag fainter than the faintest praesepe wd , so it is not unreasonable to assume that the sample is complete ( aside from the complication of wds in binary systems ) in the central 2.1 square degrees ( @xmath23 radius ) of praesepe .",
    "members of praesepe are known to exist out to a radius of @xmath24 @xcite , so it is quite possible that more cluster wds exist in the outer regions of the cluster , just as the wd population in the open cluster m67 is observed to extend to the largest cluster radii @xcite .",
    "the potential number of praesepe wds outside the surveyed area can be estimated by several means . using the parameters of the best - fitting king model determined by @xcite , we find that @xmath25 of the stellar content of praesepe is outside the central @xmath26 .",
    "using the profile of @xmath1 stars in @xcite , we estimate that @xmath27 of the stellar content is outside the surveyed regions .",
    "therefore , _ if _ the wd population of praesepe has the same radial distribution as that of the majority of the stellar population ( discussed in  [ sec.kicks ] ) , praesepe may have a total population of @xmath28 to 30 wds .",
    "the number of expected , observable wds in praesepe was calculated in @xcite to be seven to 21 wds .",
    "this calculation used the luminosity function of @xcite , which covered the central @xmath29 sq .",
    "degrees of praesepe .",
    "the large range in the number of expected wds arises primarily from the assumed imf .",
    "if this calculation is scaled by the radial profile of @xcite under the assumption that the wd radial profile follows that of the @xmath1 stars , we estimate that @xmath30 to 5 wds should be found in the central region studied by @xcite , in agreement with the five known praesepe wds .",
    "if , however , these five known praesepe wds represent the _ entire _ wd population of the cluster , then praesepe suffers from the same deficit of wds as the hyades @xcite .",
    "one explanation for the deficit of wds in open clusters is that during the mass - loss phase of the progenitor star s stellar evolution , the future wd is accelerated due to asymmetric mass loss , resulting in a small net velocity `` kick '' @xcite .",
    "a net velocity of just a few km / s is sufficient to remove the majority of wds from an open cluster on short time scales @xcite . in n - body simulations not considering velocity kicks , the wd populations of open clusters with ages similar to praesepe have radial profiles very similar to those of the luminous stars and subgiants @xcite .",
    "figure  [ praesepe.fig ] shows the location of the five praesepe wd candidates with respect to the cluster .",
    "the figure shows a @xmath31 region centered on praesepe , which agrees well with the cluster core radius of @xmath32 @xcite",
    ". also indicated on the figure is the region of sky studied by @xcite .",
    "all of the cluster member wds are located within @xmath33 of the cluster center , even though the region studied in @xcite extends @xmath34 out from the center .    figure  [ praesepe_dist.fig]a compares the cumulative distribution of wds as a function of radius from the cluster center to the distribution of cluster stars interior to @xmath26 from data by @xcite . from the figure it appears that the wd distribution follows that of the massive cluster stars , exactly as predicted for a wd population with no net velocity kick .",
    "a k - s test comparing the wd radial distribution to that of the stars finds that the wd distribution is consistent with that of the stars with masses @xmath35 and weakly inconsistent with the distribution of lower mass stars .    to test further the significance of the wd radial distribution",
    ", two monte carlo simulation were performed . in the first",
    ", five stars were drawn from the central @xmath26 radial distribution of the @xmath36 stars in @xcite .",
    "out of 10,000 realizations , 13% had all five selected stars interior to the @xmath37 extent of the known wd population .",
    "the second monte carlo simulation drew stars from the radial distribution of @xmath38 stars from the entire @xcite sample until five stars interior to @xmath37 were found .",
    "of these , only 15% of the realizations were found to have no additional stars in the annulus between @xmath37 and @xmath26 .",
    "these simulations hint that the wd population is more consistent with the giants and subgiants of praesepe than with the lower mass , as - yet unevolved cluster members , as predicted by the n - body calculations that do not include a velocity kick .",
    "figure  [ praesepe_dist.fig]b shows the resulting radial distribution of wds compared with those for other praesepe stars if the five known wds represent the entire wd population of praesepe . in this case , the similarity of the wds with subgiant and giant praesepe members is even more striking",
    ".    the concentration of wds toward the center of the cluster may not be inconsistent with the concept of velocity kicks if all the wds with non - zero kicks have already been lost from the cluster ( or are at larger radii )",
    ". it would be useful for n - body simulations of open clusters to explore how the apparent radial distribution of wds varies with the strength of the applied kick .",
    "we also note that the pleiad wd ( ) is located @xmath39 away from the tightly - concentrated core of the cluster , well outside the half - mass radius ( @xmath40 ) but within the pleiades tidal radius ( @xmath41 ) @xcite .",
    "this contrasts with the central concentration of wds observed in praesepe and further serves to muddy the waters .",
    "it is also possible that the dearth of wds in praesepe could be due to a steeper imf than normally considered . to explore this possibility",
    ", we use the code from @xcite to calculate the wd population of praesepe for various imf slopes .",
    "the parameters used to normalize the imf and the wd detection criteria are the same as those for praesepe presented in @xcite ; @xmath42 is taken to be @xmath3 , and the binary fraction is taken to be 0.4 .",
    "two different imfs were explored  a power - law imf of the form @xmath43 and the broken power - law imf from @xcite , with a steep high - mass power law imf ( @xmath44 for @xmath45 ) and a flat low - mass slope ( @xmath46 for @xmath47 ) .",
    "the praesepe member has a progenitor mass @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "we therefore calculate the likelihood that , for a given imf slope @xmath49 , no wds with progenitor masses @xmath50 are observed .",
    "the value of @xmath49 was then varied to find the slopes corresponding to confidence levels of 60% , 90% , and 95% .",
    "results are given in table [ calculations.tab ] .",
    "the calculations show that the lack of high - progenitor - mass wds , the lack of wds observed in binary systems , and the overall deficit of wds in praesepe can be explained by a steep high - mass imf .",
    "assuming poisson statistics , both the @xmath51 power - law imf and the @xmath52 broken power - law imf are remarkably consistent with the praesepe wd population , though such steep imfs are contrary to what is observed in younger open clusters @xcite .",
