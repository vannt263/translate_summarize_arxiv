    "direct detection of exoplanets with polarimetry opens the prospect for probing their atmospheres . a reflecting planet breaks the symmetry of the stellar radiation and conspicuously marks its presence in polarized light ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a very high statistics of the data ( about 100 nightly measurements ) and an even distribution over orbital phases have enabled the detection of variable , phase - locked polarization of maximum @xmath32@xmath1110@xmath13 and best - fit amplitudes in stokes @xmath9 and @xmath10 of ( 1.5@xmath140.3)@xmath1110@xmath13 and ( 1.1@xmath140.4)@xmath1110@xmath13 , respectively , for binned data .",

    "the new observations were carried out in 2008 april 1824 and august 29 with the turpol @xmath16 polarimeter mounted in the cassegrain focus at the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) .",
    "the polarimeter was designed by @xcite .",
    "it consists of a half- ( or quarter- ) wave plate as retarder , calcite block , diaphragms , chopper , filter wheel , dichroic mirrors , and five photomultipliers as detectors for the @xmath16 bands .",
    "the calcite block splits the light onto parallel ordinary and extraordinary beams .",
    "thus , the sky contributes to both beams and its polarization ( e.g. , due to dust in the earth atmosphere or moonlight ) can be exactly compensated .",
    "this is a great advantage of turpol to the polarimeters planetpol of @xcite and its copy polish of w09 which have to monitor very accurately a variable sky polarization .",
    "the rapidly rotating chopper ( 25hz ) alternates integration of the ordinary and extraordinary beams at the same detector for each band simultaneously , which strongly diminishes systematic effects due to instrumental sensitivity , seeing and variable sky transparency . to measure linear polarization ,",
    "the retarder was rotated at 22.5  intervals .",
    "each pair of the observed stokes @xmath9 and @xmath10 was calculated from eight exposures at different orientations of the retarder , which allowed us to avoid systematic errors due to imperfections of the retarder .",
    "our definition of the @xmath17-system is in accordance with the common agreement that positive and negative @xmath9 are in the north - south and east - west directions , respectively , while positive and negative @xmath10 are at an angle of 45  counter - clockwise from the positive and negative @xmath9 .    to determine the instrumental polarization , we observed 26 nearby , bright , nonvariable , and nonpeculiar stars ( @xmath5=4@xmath186@xmath18 , @xmath19pc ) of spectral classes a",

    "some stars were observed a few times on different nights to ensure the stability .",
    "in addition , for calibration of the polarization angle zero point , we observed highly polarized standard stars hd132052 , hd161056 , and hd204827 .",

    "l09 reported that sahara dust can produce sky polarization of order 10@xmath15 at large zenith distances .",
    "this is at the noise level of our measurements .",
    "also , as explained above , the construction of the turpol enables exact compensation of any background polarization which is not variable within the time of alternation between the ordinary and extraordinary beams ( 1/25s in our case ) .",
    "the very good agreement between the measurements of the instrumental polarization in april and august proves that this technique works very well .",
    "moreover , since we increased total integration time in august due to increased opacity of the sky , the accuracy achieved in august was on average better than that in april .",
    "therefore , we conclude that sahara dust has not changed the polarization noise or introduced bias into our observations .",
    "our science targets were a number of nearby systems with hot jupiters .",
    "here we report results for hd189733b only , while data for other systems will be analyzed in subsequent papers .",
    "we made 10s exposures in the @xmath0 passbands simultaneously during 34 hours every clear night and obtained 1@xmath282 measurements per night in each band ( 35 in total ) with individual errors of ( 46)@xmath1110@xmath15 in the @xmath2 band and ( 24)@xmath1110@xmath15 in the @xmath1 and @xmath5 bands .",

    "the uncertainties were calculated as standard deviations from the best fits .",
    "the @xmath1 amplitude is in agreement with the previously reported polarization by b08 within the standard deviation . in stokes",
    "@xmath9 the largest difference is seen only in one b08 binned data point near the phase 0.7 , while all other points agree well with the new data . in stokes @xmath10 only two points deviate near the phases 0.2 and 0.65 , but they are still within about one standard deviation .",
    "as the @xmath2 and @xmath1 amplitudes are similar , we can improve the statistics by binning together the new @xmath29-band data and the @xmath1-band data of b08 ( lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : pol ] ) .",
    "the standard deviation is then reduced down to 1.1@xmath1110@xmath15 .",
    "we also find a consistency between our measurements in the @xmath5 band and those of w09 , which were centered at about the same wavelength ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pol ] ) .",
    "one can see that only one of the six w09 measurements ( which provided the upper limit ) is at a phase near elongation where a polarization signal of about 5@xmath1110@xmath15 is expected .",
    "it matches perfectly the w09 upper limit .",
    "therefore , the `` null '' result concluded by w09 is misleading due to the overlooked wavelength dependence of polarization .",
    "our primary hypothesis is that the observed polarization is due to scattering in the planetary atmosphere .",
    "the shape of the phase curve with two peaks near elongations is a strong argument in favor of this ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pol ] ) .",
    "it can be reproduced with a simple reflecting model ( sect .",
    "[ sec : mod ] ) .",
    "however , one can imagine alternative scenarios for the origin of the observed polarization .",
    "for example , starspots detected on the host star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter p07 ) when appear near the limb may cause incomplete cancellation of the stellar limb polarization .",
    "assuming typical parameters of starspots on a k dwarf @xcite and computing its most probable limb polarization at 400 nm @xcite , we evaluated a possible effect for the large spot feature a detected by p07 .",
    "such a spot near the limb would cause maximum 5@xmath1110@xmath30 polarization . if its area is artificially increased up to 1% , which is the maximum spot area observed on the stellar disk @xcite , the polarization can be 3@xmath1110@xmath12 .",
    "note that the projected spot area is strongly reduced toward the limb , and can not be as large as 1% near the limb ( this is in contrast , e.g. , to transits , when the projected area of the planet does not depend on the limb distance ) . also , due to possible simultaneous presence of several spots near different parts of the limb , an expected effect is even smaller .",
    "these calculations demonstrate that the spot area on hd189733 is simply too small to be responsible for the 10@xmath13 effect in linear polarization .",
    "a transversal zeeman effect due to starspot magnetic fields is also excluded at the level above 10@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "another symmetry breaking effect resulting in a non - zero polarization could be due to tidal interaction of the planet with the star .",
    "following @xcite we have evaluated the height of tidal bumps on the stellar surface to be about 1 km .",
    "this results in the ellipticity of the star of 2@xmath1110@xmath12 and the maximum residual limb polarization of 10@xmath31 , which is totally negligible .",
    "we therefore concentrate our efforts on modeling the observed polarization under the assumption that it is caused by scattering in the planetary atmosphere .",

    "note that extrapolation of the planet radius using this model to the near infrared fits well the corresponding transit measurements @xcite , but it underestimates the radius in the @xmath1 band ( and probably in @xmath2 ) .",
