    "surface plasmon - polaritons , often referred to as plasmons for brevity , are hybrid excitations that can arise from the interaction of the electron plasma in good conductors with external electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "plasmonics , the field of study of plasmon dynamics , has attracted considerable interest in recent years as a promising path towards the miniaturization of nanophotonics @xcite .",
    "conventionally , noble metals are considered as plasmonic materials , with diverse applications such as integrated photonic systems @xcite , magneto - photonic structures @xcite , metamaterials and cloaking @xcite , biosensing @xcite and photovoltaic devices @xcite in the visible to near - infrared spectrum @xcite . however , at thz to mid - infrared frequencies , which have various applications @xcite in information and communication , biology , chemical and biological sensing , homeland security , and spectroscopy , metal plasmonic materials are quite lossy .",
    "therefore , there is considerable interest in low - loss plasmonic materials at these frequencies @xcite .",
    "graphene , the two - dimensional allotrope of carbon @xcite , is a promising plasmonic material @xcite .",
    "its resonance typically falls in the thz to mid - infrared range @xcite and it shows significantly different screening properties and collective excitations than the quasi-2d systems with parabolic electron dispersions @xcite .",
    "moreoever , graphene s carrier density is easily tunable by an external gate voltage @xcite , which enables electrostatic control of its electronic and optical properties .",
    "plasmons in graphene have been experimentally excited and visualized by several methods , such as the electron energy - loss spectroscopy ( eels ) @xcite , fourier - transform infrared spectroscopy ( ftir ) @xcite , and scanning near - filed optical microscopy ( snom ) @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies have also been performed : the momentum - independent graphene conductivity was calculated within the local phase approximation used along with finite - element @xcite and transfer matrix methods @xcite in order to solve the electromagnetic equations for the plasmon modes .",
    "however , plasmons are in the nonretarded regime at mid - infrared frequencies , so the momentum dependence of the optical response should be considered .",
    "the lindhard dielectric function @xmath1 @xcite has a dependence on both frequency ( @xmath2 ) and wave vector ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "it captures interband transitions due to the electromagnetic field and is based on the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "the rpa can also explain the coupling between graphene plasmons and surface optical ( so ) phonons on polar substrates @xcite , a phenomenon that has been captured experimentally @xcite .",
    "graphene plasmon modes have much shorter wave lengths than light with the same frequencies , and their propagation length is very sensitive to the damping pathways , such as intrinsic phonons @xcite , ionized impurities @xcite , and so phonons on polar substrates @xcite .",
    "the damping of graphene plasmons has been calculated based on the mermin - lindhard ( ml ) dielectric function @xcite and its simplified version , the drude dielectric function @xcite .",
    "the ml dielectric function stems from mermin s derivation @xcite of the lindhard expression based on a master equation and within the relaxation - time approximation ( rta ) , with a single effective relaxation time accounting for all scattering .",
    "however , the ml dielectric function was derived for electronic systems with a parabolic band dispersion and is also only valid when intraband dissipation mechanisms dominate . in the case of nanostructures with nonparabolic dispersions , densely spaced energy subbands , or in the presence of efficient interband dissipation mechanisms ( e.g. , optical phonons )",
    ", the ml dielectric function provides an incomplete picture .    with multiple concurrent scattering mechanisms ,",
    "it is common to extract an averaged relaxation time corresponding to each mechanism separately and then calculate the total relaxation time based on mattheissen s rule @xcite .",
    "however , matthiessen s rule technically holds only when all mechanisms have the same relaxation time vs energy dependence @xcite .",
    "also , employing a single energy - independent relaxation time is generally not a good approximation for systems with pronounced non - coulomb scattering mechanisms @xcite , such as phonons in nonpolar materials ; indeed , the use of a single relaxation time has been shown not to accurately capture the loss mechanisms in suspended and , to a lower degree , supported graphene @xcite .",
    "what is needed is an accurate ( and , ideally , computationally inexpensive ) theoretical approach that can treat the interaction of light with charge carries in graphene ( and in related nanomaterials ) in the presence of both interband and intraband transitions due to multiple competing scattering mechanisms , where the transition rates can have pronounced and widely differing dependencies on both carrier energy and momentum .    in this paper , we present a method for calculating the dielectric function of a dissipative electronic system with an arbitrary band dispersion and bloch wave functions by a self - consistent - field approach within an open - system markovian master - equation formalism ( scf - mmef ) coupled with full - wave electromagnetic equations ( sec .",
    "[ sect2 ] ) .",
    "we derive a generalized markovian master equation @xcite of the lindblad form ( i.e. , conserving the positivity of the density matrix ) , which includes the interaction of the electronic system with an external electromagnetic field ( to first order ) and with a dissipative environment ( to second order ) .",
    "we solve for the time evolution of coherences and calculate the induced charge density as a function of the self - consistent field within linear response .",
    "based on the electrodynamic relation between the induced charge density and the induced potential , we obtain the expressions for the polarization , dielectric function , and conductivity ( sec .",
    "[ sect2 ] ) .",
    "numerical implementation is achieved with the aid of brillouin - zone discretization , and the resulting matrix equations are readily solved using modern linear solvers ( sec . [ numerics ] ) .",
    "we use the scf - mmef to calculate the graphene dielectric function , complex conductivity , and loss function ( sec .",
    "[ sect3 ] ) .",
    "the complex conductivity agrees well with experiment and its dc limit shows a well - known sublinearity at high carrier densities . at low carrier densities ,",
    "the screening length depends on the impurity density , which is a phenomenon that the ml approach can not capture ( sec . [ sect3a ] ) .",
    "the plasmon modes and their propagation length are obtained from the loss - function maximum ( sec .",
    "[ sect3c ] ) .",
    "we did our calculations for three substrates : diamondlike carbon ( dlc ) @xcite as a non - polar substrate , and @xmath4 @xcite and hbn @xcite as polar substrates , with the effect of so phonons captured via a weak frhlich term .",
    "we investigate the effects of substrate type , substrate impurity density , carrier density , and temperature on the dielectric function and plasmon characteristics .",
    "plasmon dispersion is fairly insensitive to varying impurity density or temperature , but is pushed towards shorter wave vectors with increasing carrier density .",
    "plasmons are strongly suppressed on polar substrates below the substrate optical - phonon energies .",
    "plasmon damping  inversely proportional to the number of wave lengths that a plasmon propagates before dying out  worsens with more pronounced scattering , such as when the impurity density or temperature are increased .",
    "however , damping drops with increasing carrier density , benefiting plasmon propagation .",
    "overall , the plasmon propagation length in absolute units improves on substrates with fewer impurities , and is better at low temperatures and at higher carrier densities .",
    "plasmon propagation lengths on polar and nonpolar substrates are comparable and in the tens of nanometers , an order of magnitude lower than previously reported @xcite . we conclude with sec .",
    "[ sect4 ] .",
    "in this section , we present a detailed derivation of the scf - mmef in order to calculate the dielectric function and the conductivity of graphene , a two - dimensional material .",
    "we note that the scf - mmef is quite general and can be applied to electronic systems of arbitrary dimensionality ( see appendix [ app ] for quasi - one - dimensional materials ) .",
    "single - layer graphene has a density - independent wigner - seitz radius @xmath5 ( @xmath6 for graphene on sio@xmath0 @xcite ) , owing to linear electron dispersion .",
    "therefore , it can be considered a weakly interacting system in which the random - phase approximation ( rpa , the equivalent of the scf approximation we use here ) is valid . intuitively , the question is whether the carriers in graphene are effective at screening .",
    "for graphene on a substrate , the affirmative answer is supported by experimental observations of drudelike behavior of the electronic system in frequency - dependent conductivity measurements @xcite .",
    "this holds even at low carrier densities , as electrons and holes form puddles , so the carrier density locally exceeds the impurity density @xcite .",
    "( we note that , in bilayer graphene and at low carrier densities , the scf / rpa approximation becomes more difficult to justify @xcite . )",
