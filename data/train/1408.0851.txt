    "the light - curve synthesis indicates a detached configuration for the binary system though the secondary component is very nearly filling its roche lobe .",
    "it means that oo dra could not be a member of the oea ( mkrtichian et al .",
    "2004 ) class .",
    "since the number of @xmath58 sct stars in confirmed detached algols is very small ( liakos et al . 2012 ) , this star could be an important object in studying of pulsating eclipsing binaries .    with results from the photometric solution ,",
