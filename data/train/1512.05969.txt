    "we consider the dynamics of a beam of charged particles described by its distribution @xmath0 in phase space . under the assumption that the collisions are neglected , this dynamics is described by the vlasov equation for the distribution @xmath1 : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the force driving the particles , potentially of electromagnetic nature . in realistic plasma configurations ,",
    "the numerical integration of such an equation is challenging .",
    "in addition , it provides information in phase space which is sometimes difficult to interpret physically .",
    "this kind of models lends itself very well to reduced models which display the physical phenomena with much more clarity ( to the expense of loosing quantitative agreement in general ) .",
    "there has been a rather extensive emphasis on fluid reductions which means that the dynamical variables are functions of the position @xmath4 only , no more on the velocity @xmath5 .",
    "this is for instance obtained by considering fluid moments of the distribution function @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the resulting fluid equations are much more tractable than kinetic equations like the vlasov equations , and are widely used in fluid and plasma physics .",
    "the difficulty in using these fluid equations in plasma physics is that they do not sufficiently take into account kinetic effects . in order to remedy this problem ,",
    "there is a need to include a high number of fluid moments which , as a result , complexifies the analysis of the resulting physical phenomena , since it involves a high number of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations .",
    "an alternative approach is to consider phase space moments for which the reduced models become finite dimensional ( i.e. , described by ordinary differential equations ) which facilitates the analysis .",
    "the phase space moments are defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "we notice that @xmath11 is the total number of particles and @xmath12 , with @xmath13 , is the @xmath14th component of the average distance ( also called beam centroid ) and @xmath15 with @xmath16 , is the @xmath14th component of the average velocity associated with the distribution function",
    ". some of these phase space moments are directly measurable quantities which make them appropriate variables to describe the dynamics .",
    "there is a rather extensive literature of phase space moment reductions , especially in the field of beam dynamics in linear plasma - based accelerators  @xcite .",
    "the principle of the reduction is the following one : a reduced set of phase space moments @xmath17 , relevant to the problem at hand , has to be identified .",
    "we denote the set of indices @xmath18 of these relevant moments @xmath19 . in general",
    ", the dynamics of these relevant moments depend on additional moments whose set of indices is denoted @xmath20 .",
    "the closure on @xmath17 for @xmath21 is a specific function of the dynamical variables @xmath22 for @xmath23 which preserves the hamiltonian properties of the parent model , i.e. , the vlasov equation .",
    "the dynamics of any observable @xmath24 , scalar function of the variables @xmath17 for @xmath25 , is described by a hamiltonian @xmath26 and a poisson bracket @xmath27 as @xmath28 and the poisson bracket is a bilinear operator satisfying the antisymmetry property @xmath29 the leibniz rule , @xmath30 and the jacobi identity , @xmath31 for any observables @xmath24 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . as usual , the last property is the crucial one and also the most difficult one to satisfy .",
    "it leads to a very specific subset of possible closures . as a result",
    ", it drastically constrains the phase space of the reduced dynamics .",
    "in particular , the jacobi identity imposes the foliation of phase space by a set of casimir invariants which are observables @xmath34 which poisson - commute with all the other observables , i.e. , @xmath35 for all observables @xmath24 . for an introduction on hamiltonian systems and poisson algebras , we refer to refs .",

    "some hamiltonian fluid closures were investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite using the fluid moments defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fm ] ) .",
    "in particular it was noticed that some @xmath36-moment fluid closures were obtained using the waterbag distribution functions or by dimensional analysis by solving the jacobi identity .",
    "one of the objectives of the present work is to follow the same procedure for the phase space moments defined by eq .",

    "sec : close ] , we provide some general results on the possible closures , and list some examples , by considering specific subsets of variables .",
    "we consider the one - dimensional ( @xmath37 ) vlasov equation @xmath38 the dynamical field variable is @xmath39 and we consider the algebra of functionals of @xmath0 .",
    "the poisson bracket is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the functional derivative of @xmath24 with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "we recall that the casimir invariants of the bracket  ( [ eq : pbv ] ) are given by @xmath42 for any scalar function @xmath43 .",
    "the choice of the hamiltonian depends on the problem at hand .",
    "for instance , for the one - dimensional vlasov - poisson equation for which @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the hamiltonian is given by @xmath46=\\frac{1}{2}\\iint { \\rm d}x{\\rm d } v~ \\left(v^2",
    "f + f{\\cal l } f\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath47 ( defined using proper boundary conditions ) .",
    "however the specific expression of the hamiltonian is not particularly relevant for the analysis presented below .",
    "in particular the expression of the hamiltonian as a function of the phase space moments does not present any major difficulty .",
    "it might involve a truncation in order to have the hamiltonian in the finite - dimensional poisson algebra , but this truncation doe not affect the poisson structure of the resulting truncated model . on the contrary ,",
    "truncating the poisson bracket results in general in the break - up of the hamiltonian structure of the model , since the jacobi identity is in general not satisfied . as we shall see below , this",
    "drastically affects the resulting dynamics .",
    "expressed in the phase space moments , i.e. , moving from functionals of @xmath0 to functions of @xmath48 defined as @xmath49 the poisson bracket becomes  @xcite @xmath50 with implicit summation over repeated indices @xmath51 .",
    "we notice that @xmath11 ( which is the total number of particles ) is a casimir invariant of the poisson bracket  ( [ eq : pb_p ] ) . in what follows",
    ", we assume @xmath52 without loss of generality , by rescaling the distribution function by the total number of particles .",
    "first we identify several poisson sub - algebras :    * subalgebra 1 : the set of observables @xmath53 .",
    "the poisson bracket is the canonical one @xmath54 the coordinate centroid is canonically conjugate to the momentum centroid which is very reasonable from a macroscopic viewpoint .",
    "* subalgebra 2 : the set of observables @xmath55 .",
    "the poisson bracket is @xmath56 this poisson bracket has one casimir invariant @xmath57 , the covariance of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "this subalgebra is not particularly interesting since it reduces the dynamics to one degree of freedom [ the macroscopic degree of freedom @xmath60 on each leaf defined by the value of the casimir invariant . like subalgebra 1",
    ", it does not possess any degree of freedom related to the shape of the beam .",
    "* subalgebra 3 : the set of observables @xmath61 for any arbitrary @xmath62 .",
    "the poisson bracket is @xmath63 where the implicit summation over @xmath64 goes from 2 to @xmath36 .",
    "this poisson bracket has @xmath65 casimir invariants @xmath66 given by @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "we notice that the first three subalgebras do not contain the kinetic energy @xmath69 .",
    "indeed hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h ] ) is rewritten as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is an arbitrary function .",
    "therefore , in order to close the system , we need to express @xmath72 as a function of the other variables . a common way of doing it is to decompose @xmath73 by @xmath74 ( the macroscopic kinetic energy ) and a fluctuating term corresponding to an internal energy @xmath75 which is a well - chosen function of all the other dynamical variables ( see the example provided in subalgebra 4 ) , accounting for the microscopic dynamics .",
    "subalgebra 3 is particularly interesting since it allows the treatment of arbitrary nonlinearities in the potential created , e.g. , by the elements of a particle accelerator , in a closed form .",
    "in addition , given the number of dynamical variables and the number of casimir invariants , the system is equivalent to a two degrees of freedom hamiltonian system in terms of effective phase space dimension : there is one macroscopic degree of freedom associated with the position of the beam , namely @xmath76 , and one microscopic degree of freedom associated with the shape of the beam .",
    "+ the corresponding bracket @xmath77 in the variables @xmath78 is non - canonical . in order to make the bracket canonical",
    ", we perform the non - canonical change of variables @xmath79 we notice that for non - zero @xmath0 , the variance @xmath80 is always strictly positive .",
    "the last two variables in the above expression are the two canonically conjugate variables describing the degree of freedom associated with the shape of the beam : @xmath81 is the standard deviation of the beam and @xmath82 its canonically conjugate momentum .",
    "+ there is also another subalgebra which is related to this one by inverting the roles of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the poisson bracket is the same as the one above up to a change of sign .",
    "* subalgebra 4 : the set of observables @xmath83 .",
    "the poisson bracket is @xmath84 this subalgebra and this bracket correspond to the ones identified in refs .",
    "the poisson bracket has one casimir invariant given by @xmath85 which is called the emittance in accelerator physics .",
    "it corresponds to the determinant of the covariance matrix .",
    "this subalgebra allows the inclusion of the full kinetic energy @xmath73 , even though it is restricted to quadratic potential ( i.e. , linear forces ) .",
    "this subalgebra is not fundamentally different from subalgebra 3 since both of them have only one degree of freedom associated with the shape of the beam .",
    "given a value of the casimir invariant , both subalgebras lead to the same dynamics provided the kinetic term @xmath73 is replaced by @xmath86 where the second term on the right hand side of the above equation is the internal energy .",
    "in particular , the consequence is that the resulting hamiltonian , derived from hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h2 ] ) using eq .",
    "( [ eq : k2 ] ) , presents an explicit ( quadratic ) dependence on @xmath87 which is the canonically conjugate momentum of the standard deviation of the distribution function .",
    "* subalgebra 5 : the set of observables @xmath88 .",
    "this is not a finite - dimensional subalgebra since it contains an infinite set of variables .",
    "this subalgebra corresponds to the subalgebra in the fluid case where the observables are functions of the fluid density and the fluid velocity only .",
    "the poisson bracket writes @xmath89 with the implicit summation over @xmath64 and @xmath90 from 0 to infinity .",
    "this poisson bracket has @xmath11 as casimir invariant . in particular",
    "we notice that subalgebra 3 is a poisson subalgebra of subalgebra 5 .",
    "the main drawback of this subalgebra is that it does not have the second order moment in velocity , @xmath72 , linked to the kinetic energy term in the hamiltonian , among its variables .",
    "the casimir invariants associated with the above families of subalgebras , in particular subalgebra 3 , evidence a particularly well suited change of variables , the central moments which will be considered in what follows .",
    "these poisson subalgebras are the most obvious ones , but not the only ones . in the next section ,",
    "we identify additional non - trivial poisson subalgebras which are more obvious in the other set of variables , the central moments .",
    "we introduce the phase - space central moments defined by @xmath91 we notice that the covariant matrix elements are @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the expressions of @xmath95 with respect to @xmath48 are given by @xmath96 this expression is invertible  : @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the expression of the poisson bracket  ( [ eq : pb_p ] ) is @xmath100 with @xmath101 the implicit summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : brackw ] ) excludes @xmath102 ( or @xmath103 ) equal to @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 . in order to obtain the expression of bracket  ( [ eq : brackw ] ) , we used the vandermonde s identity .",
    "we notice that the tensor @xmath107 is symmetric , in the sense that @xmath108 in order to ensure the antisymmetry of the poisson bracket .",
    "the expression of the poisson bracket in this set of variables is particularly interesting since it decouples the macroscopic degree of freedom @xmath76 from the microscopic degrees of freedom , represented by the variables @xmath95 , regulating the shape of the beam . in particular ,",
    "the set of observables @xmath109 is a poisson subalgebra , since the coefficient of @xmath107 do not depend on @xmath110 and @xmath111 .    we notice that the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha ] ) contain a linear part in the @xmath112s whose expression is identical to the one of the bracket in @xmath113s in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pb_p ] ) .",
    "however a noticeable difference between the bracket expressed in the variables @xmath113s with the one expressed in the variables @xmath112s is that the bracket in @xmath112s contains quadratic terms which drastically complicate the analysis and the reduction procedure as we shall see below .",
    "the problem of the closure is to select a _ finite _ number of moments @xmath48 for the problem at hand , i.e. , select a finite subset @xmath114 of @xmath115 in which @xmath48 is a variable when @xmath116 .",
    "when the set of observables @xmath24 depending on these relevant variables are considered , the poisson bracket explicitly depends on a finite number of additional @xmath48 which are not considered as relevant dynamical variables .",
    "the set of these additional phase space moments is denoted @xmath117 .",
    "therefore the bracket has to be closed , i.e. , for all @xmath118 , we assume that @xmath119      finite dimensional lie - poisson approximations of the infinite dimensional lie - poisson structure of the vlasov equation have been proposed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the set of moments @xmath48 with @xmath120 is a poisson algebra if @xmath121 for all @xmath122 and @xmath123 . in particular , this reduction removes ad hoc the macroscopic degree of freedom @xmath76 , hypothesizing that this macroscopic degree of freedom is decoupled from the internal degrees of freedom regulating the shape of the beam .",
    "these closures leading to finite dimensional lie - poisson algebras were used to devise numerical algorithms to integrate the vlasov equation using phase - space moments of the vlasov distribution  @xcite , using the symplectic integration algorithms developed for finite dimensional lie - poisson algebras .",
    "the main ingredient behind these finite - dimensional lie - poisson algebras is the linearity of the coefficients in bracket  ( [ eq : pb_p ] ) .",
    "the simplest example is when the dynamical variables are @xmath124 ( i.e. , @xmath125 ) .",
    "the poisson bracket writes @xmath126 in this case , there is no need to close the system since the set of observables of @xmath124 is a poisson subalgebra ( which is actually a subalgebra of subalgebra 4 in sec .",
    "[ sec : sub ] ) .",
    "it has the beam emittance @xmath127 as casimir invariant .",
    "the first non - trivial case corresponds to a system whose dynamical variables are @xmath128 , i.e. , @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the poisson bracket is given by @xmath131 where @xmath132 the finite - dimensional lie - poisson argument consists in setting @xmath133 , i.e. , removing @xmath134 from bracket  ( [ eq : lp4 ] ) .",
    "the resulting bracket  ( [ eq : lp4 ] ) satisfies the jacobi identity .",
    "it has one casimir invariant : @xmath135 which is the equivalent of the beam emittance for the case @xmath125 .",
    "more generally , it can be shown that the jacobi identity restricted to the observables @xmath136 is a linear function of @xmath48 with @xmath122 , for all @xmath137 . by setting @xmath121 for @xmath122 ,",
    "the resulting bracket satisfies the jacobi identity .",
    "in fact , only those closures result in a poisson bracket , so @xmath121 for @xmath122 is a necessary and sufficient condition for the truncated system to be hamiltonian",
    ".    however , the truncation @xmath121 for @xmath122 might not be a reasonable approximation of the vlasov dynamics even though it is a truncation which leads to a hamiltonian system . as a matter of fact",
    ", the construction of the truncated system relies on an ad hoc assumption of decoupling between the macroscopic and the microscopic degrees of freedom which is in general not valid . in the variables @xmath113s",
    ", these degrees of freedom are naturally coupled .",
    "we have seen above that a more rigorous way of decoupling these degrees of freedom is to move to the central moments .",
    "restricting the relevant dynamical variables to @xmath48 with @xmath120 , even though practical from a theoretical perspective , might not be optimal to model / approximate the dynamics of the vlasov equation with a finite set of variables . in principle",
    ", it would be best to first decouple the macroscopic degree of freedom from the microscopic ones , i.e. , moving to the phase space central moments , before applying the reduction procedure .",
    "however the main obstacle is that the coefficients in the bracket are no longer linear in the dynamical variables , so the above lie - poisson reduction can not be applied .",
    "the strategy we adopt in this article is different : first , the set of relevant variables is chosen , e.g. , by taking into account the physical problem at hand . in other terms , a finite subset @xmath114 of @xmath115 is given so that @xmath48 belongs to the relevant dynamical variables for @xmath116 .",
    "the expression of bracket  ( [ eq : pb_p ] ) shows that it explicitly depends on a finite number of moments ( whose indices belong to a finite subset @xmath117 of @xmath115 ) which do not belong to the dynamical variables . these functions need to be closed , i.e. , one needs to determine the functions @xmath138 for @xmath118 , in order to obtain a finite - dimensional algebra .",
    "it should be noticed that , in general , these closures do not satisfy the jacobi identity , and therefore do not lead to poisson algebras .",
    "here we determine the specific conditions on the closures in order to satisfy the jacobi identity and lead to a reduced system which is of the poisson type .",
    "in particular , taking higher order @xmath113s equal to zero does not lead in general to a poisson algebra .",
    "some examples are shown in the following sections .    in order to simplify the calculations ,",
    "the general idea is to decouple the location from the shape of a lump of density in phase space in the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite . to this purpose",
    ", we use the central moments as dynamical variables .",
    "the problem of closure is now to find the closures @xmath139 for all @xmath118 , leading to a poisson algebra . from a physical point of view , it would be desirable to have at least @xmath140 in order to include the kinetic energy term of the hamiltonian as a dynamical variable , and @xmath141 for sufficiently large @xmath64 in order to include higher order nonlinearities in the potential .    given the expression of the coefficients @xmath107 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha ] ) , we notice that the truncated bracket is always linear in the closure functions @xmath95 where @xmath118 .",
    "we consider the following bracket : @xmath142 which is obtained by truncating bracket  ( [ eq : brackw ] ) , reducing the set of dynamical variables to a finite set of @xmath112s .",
    "we notice that @xmath143 depends on @xmath112s which are not dynamical variables .",
    "this dependence on extra @xmath95 for @xmath144 comes from the linear term in @xmath107 , namely @xmath145 .",
    "we close the system by assuming that these extra @xmath112s depend on the dynamical variables @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath146 for @xmath147 .    in order to satisfy the jacobi identity ,",
    "a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition is to have @xmath148 independent of @xmath110 and @xmath111 for all @xmath102 and @xmath103 belonging to @xmath114 , i.e. , all the closures only depend on @xmath95 for @xmath116 . in order to show this , we consider @xmath149 and @xmath32 and @xmath33 only functions of @xmath112s . from @xmath150 ,",
    "the jacobi identity reduces to imposing @xmath151 .",
    "taking respectively @xmath152 and @xmath153 leads to @xmath143 independent of @xmath111 and @xmath110 respectively .",
    "this means that the decoupling between the macroscopic degree of freedom and the microscopic ones is preserved in bracket  ( [ eq : brackwt ] ) by the truncation , and directly results from the jacobi identity .",
    "these degrees of freedom are , of course , coupled through the hamiltonian .    as a consequence ,",
    "the jacobi identity reduces to the following identities @xmath154 where the summation over @xmath155 is implicit , and this identity should be true for all @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath103 in @xmath114 .",
    "first we assume that @xmath158 , i.e. , @xmath94 is a dynamical variable , and we consider the case where @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 where @xmath162 .",

    "( [ eq : rescalew ] ) are obtained by rescaling .",
    "for instance , if @xmath140 , i.e. , if @xmath93 is a dynamical variable , then the closures @xmath165 are functions of the rescaled variables @xmath168 , i.e. , written as @xmath169 for all @xmath162 .",

    "these examples illustrate the complexity of finding hamiltonian closures , i.e. , solving the jacobi identity . on each example",
    ", we will see how the jacobi identity suggests relevant variables and creates a certain number of casimir invariants which foliate the phase space of the truncated hamiltonian system .",
    "the simplest example is when the dynamical variables are @xmath174 and the closure has to be on @xmath94 .",
    "bracket  ( [ eq : brackwt ] ) reads @xmath175 it is rather straightforward to check that this bracket is a poisson bracket for any function @xmath94 .",
    "a trivial remark is that if @xmath176 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are casimir invariants .",

    "the resulting dynamical system has one macroscopic degree of freedom @xmath76 and one microscopic one @xmath179 , provided @xmath177 .",
