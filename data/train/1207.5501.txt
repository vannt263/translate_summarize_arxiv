    "in december 2011 the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations reported the result of their updated search for the higgs boson  @xcite which showed indications of a signal around the @xmath1 level .",
    "these results lead to considerable theoretical activity to extract the implications of the signal  @xcite .",
    "more recently the analyses of  @xcite have received further support from the tevatron analyses  @xcite and from the combined 7  tev and 8  tev cms and atlas data  @xcite . thus the cms collaboration indicates a signal for a boson with mass of @xmath2 at @xmath3 and the atlas collaboration indicates a signal for a boson with a mass @xmath4 at @xmath5 in the combined 7  tev and 8  tev analysis  @xcite which confirm the previous indication of the boson signal by atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite .",
    "the properties of the boson still need to be fully established including its spin . assuming the particle discovered is a spin 0 cp even boson , it is pertinent to ask if it is indeed the higgs particle which enters in spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry and gives mass to gauge bosons and to quarks and leptons@xcite .",
    "further , if indeed the discovered particle is the higgs boson , it is of interest to determine its properties and any possible deviations from the standard model predictions which would be indicators of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "definitive answers to these questions will have to wait for much more data .",
    "however , partial answers already exist in the data from the tevatron and from the cms / atlas experiments .",
    "thus there is evidence already that the observed particle emulates the most obvious property of the higgs boson , i.e. , that its coupling to heavier fermions is larger than its coupling to lighter fermions .",
    "thus , if the higgs boson coupled with equal strength to fermions one would have seen an equal abundance of @xmath6 as of @xmath7 .",
    "however , the tevatron data suggests otherwise . while there is evidence of @xmath7 decay of the higgs there is no evidence of higgs decaying into @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "an experimental determination of the higgs couplings are essential in testing the standard model and to find any deviations from the standard model prediction which would be an indication of new physics .",
    "the relevant couplings to test are the higgs boson couplings to femion - anti - fermion pairs and to dibosons , i.e. , @xmath8 thus at the lhc with @xmath9 tev , and @xmath10 fb@xmath11 up to @xmath12 accuracy for couplings of @xmath13 with dibosons @xmath14 and up to @xmath15 for couplings to b , @xmath16 appear possible  @xcite .",
    "additionally , of course , one needs to test the overall consistency of the total production cross - section with the sm prediction and here currently cms has @xmath17 and atlas has @xmath18",
    "important clues to new physics can emerge by looking at deviations of the higgs boson couplings from the standard model predictions .",
    "the possibility that cms and atlas data may have an excess in the diphoton channel has already led to significant interest in the diphoton decay of the higgs . in the sm",
    "the higgs boson can decay into photons via @xmath19 and @xmath20 loops .",
    "the w - loop gives the larger contribution which is partially cancelled by the top - loop . to enhance the decay one could add extra charged particles in the loops and various works have appeared along these lines ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) more data is needed to confirm the diphoton excess as the result could be due to qcd uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "+ we discuss now the implications of the 125 gev higgs for supersymmetry ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "there are cogent arguments for the 125 gev higgs being the first evidence for supersymmetry at the lhc .",
    "the argument assumes the following : ( i ) perturbative physics up to the grand unification scale ; ( ii ) no large hierarchy problem . item ( i )",
    "disfavors composite higgs models which require non - perturbative physics below the grand unification scale .",
    "thus under constraint ( i ) the standard model is a possible candidate since the sm is a renormalizable theory and is valid up to the grand unification scale .",
    "however , the sm gives large loop corrections to the higgs mass , so that at one loop one has @xmath21 since @xmath22 gev a large fine tuning is involved , i.e. , one part in @xmath23 .",
    "thus the sm while satisfying ( i ) does not satisfy ( ii ) . on the other hand sugra models have all the merits of the sm , but are free of the large hierarchy problem and give perturbative physics up to the gut scale . here",
    "@xmath24 is essentially replaced by the stop masses .",
    "+ the second strong hint that the newly discovered particle is a susy higgs is its mass . in the standard model",
    "the upper limit on the higgs mass could be much larger .",
    "using the condition that the weak interactions not become strong one derives roughly the upper bound  @xcite @xmath25 . in susy ,",
    "the higgs quartic couplings are governed by gauge interactions and there is an upper limit which is much smaller , i.e. , @xmath26  gev  @xcite and in well motivated models such as msugra , gmsb , amsb it is even smaller . specifically in msugra  @xcite @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "it is important to realize that susy could have been excluded or come under a shadow if the higgs mass was found to be , say 200 gev . thus it is very meaningful that experimentally the higgs mass ended up below the upper limit predicted in susy and more specifically below the upper limit predicted in sugra models . in sugra",
    "the dominant one loop contribution to the higgs mass arises from the top / stop sector and is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29  gev , @xmath30 is an average stop mass , and @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 ( for a review see  @xcite ) .",
    "the loop correction is maximized when @xmath33 thus the large higgs mass , i.e. , 125 gev points to the susy scale being rather high .",
    "indeed most of the allowed parameter space consistent with all the experimental constraints appears to lie on the hyperbolic branch  @xcite , and specifically on focal curves and on focal surfaces  @xcite ( see sec.4 ) which is another indication of the overall susy scale being high .",
    "the 125 gev higgs boson also strongly constrains the sparticle landscape  @xcite ) ( for a review see  @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis of the sparticle spectra under the constraints of the high higgs boson mass allows for light sparticle masses , i.e. , the neutralino , the chargino , the gluino , the stau and the stop .",
    "the light gluino possibility has been extensively discussed in the literature ( see .",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus a low lying gluino along with the neutralino , the chargino , and the stop appear prime candidates for discovery at the lhc , although a more quantitative analysis is needed correlated with the energy of the future runs at the lhc .",
    "the discovery potential for susy in msugra at lhc at @xmath9 tev and at high luminosity with 300 ( 3000 ) fb@xmath11 of integrated luminosity is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "gauge symmetry based on @xmath34 provides a framework for unifying the @xmath35 gauge groups and for unifying quarks and leptons in a single @xmath36plet spinor representation .",
    "additionally , the 16plet also contains a right  handed singlet state , which is needed to give mass to the neutrino via the seesaw mechanism .",
    "supersymmetric @xmath34 models  @xcite have the added attraction that they predict correctly the unification of gauge couplings , and solve the hierarchy problem by virtue of supersymmetry .",
    "however , susy @xmath34 models , as usually constructed , have two drawbacks , both related to the symmetry breaking sector .",
    "first , two different mass scales are involved in breaking of the gut symmetry , one to reduce the rank and the other to reduce the symmetry all the way to @xmath35 .",
    "thus typically three types of higgs fields are needed ( for a review see  @xcite ) e.g. , @xmath37 or @xmath38 for rank reduction , and a @xmath39 , @xmath40 or @xmath41 for breaking the symmetry down to the standard model symmetry , and a 10-plet for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "multiple step breaking requires additional assumptions relating vevs of different breakings to explain gauge coupling unification of the electroweak and the strong interactions .",
    "a single step breaking does not require such an assumption and can be achieved with @xmath42  @xcite of higgs fields .",
    "the reason for this is easily understood by looking at the decomposition of @xmath43 and @xmath44 multiplets under @xmath45 . thus one has @xmath46 .",
    "now the 24-plet carries a @xmath47 quantum number and thus a vev formation of it will reduce the rank of the group as well as break @xmath48 .",
    "additionally , one can obtain a pair of light higgs doublets needed for electroweak symmetry breaking from the same irreducible @xmath42 higgs multiplet .",
    "thus @xmath34 reduces to @xmath49 with just one pair of @xmath50 multiplets .",
    "+ second , gut theories typically have the doublet - triplet problem , i.e. , one must do an extreme fine  tuning at the level of one part in @xmath23 to get the higgs doublets of mssm light , while color - triplets remain superheavy .",
    "some possible solutions to the doublet - triplet problem include ( i ) missing vev mechanism where @xmath34 breaks in the b - l direction , ( ii ) flipped @xmath45 , ( iii ) missing partner mechanism , ( iv ) orbifold guts .",
    "the flipped @xmath45 , missing partner mechanism and the orbifold guts are rather compelling in that some doublets are forced to be massless",
    ". we will focus on the missing partner mechanism  @xcite and discuss how it works in @xmath48 and then discuss how one can extend to @xmath34 . in su(5 ) to obtain higgs doublets which are naturally light one uses an array of light and heavy higgs multiplets so that the heavy multplets consist of @xmath51 multiplets and the light multiplets consist of @xmath52 , i.e. , one has mass terms for @xmath53 and no mass terms for @xmath54 .",
    "the 75-plet breaks the gut symmetry to @xmath55 .",
    "the key element is that @xmath56 have no doublet pairs ( d ) and only triplet / anti - triplet pairs ( t ) .",
    "thus @xmath57 have @xmath58 while @xmath59 have @xmath60 .",
    "the higgs triplets / anti - triplets of @xmath56 mix with the higgs triplets / anti - triplets of @xmath54 to become heavy .",
    "this is accomplished via the superpotential @xmath61 .",
    "the doublets in @xmath62 have nothing to pair up with and remain light .",
    "next we extend the missing partner mechanism to @xmath34 . here",
    "one case has previously been worked out , i.e. , the case with the heavy sector consisting of @xmath38 and the light sector consisting of @xmath63  @xcite . in recent works several other cases",
    "have been found  @xcite .",
    "these models are anchored in @xmath64 or @xmath65 which play the role of @xmath66 .",
    "analysis of these larger representations require special tools which utilize oscillator techniques  @xcite .",
    "+ however , to connect the high scale physics to low energies we need to break supersymmetry . as is well known in global supersymmetry , it is difficult to achieve the breaking of supersymmetry in a phenomenologically acceptable fashion .",
    "to do so one must consider local supersymmetry which involves gravity   @xcite .",
    "thus one needs to construct supergravity grand unified models  @xcite , coupled with radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry ( for a review see  @xcite ) using renormalization group evolution of gauge , yukawa and of soft terms  @xcite .",
    "a broad class of models fall under this rubric .",
    "these include msugra ( cmssm ) , and sugra models with non - universalities in the higgs sector and in the gaugino sector .",
    "msugra has the parameter space @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the universal scalar mass , @xmath69 is the universal gaugino mass , @xmath70 is the universal trilinear coupling , @xmath71 is the ratio @xmath72 where , @xmath73 gives mass to the up quarks and @xmath74 gives mass to the down quarks and leptons and @xmath75 is the higgs mixing parameter .",
    "the msugra model assumes a flavor independent kahler potential .",
    "however , the nature of physics at the planck scale is not fully understood .",
    "thus it is useful to consider more general kahler potentials , and indeed in string models and in d brane models one often encounters more general kahler potentials ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "such choices give rise to non - universal supergravity models which we may label as nusugra models .",
    "these include models with non - universal gaugino masses  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) where the gaugino sector is characterized by the three parameters @xmath76 which characterize the gaugino masses for the gauge groups @xmath47 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "similarly , one could have non - uinversality in the higgs boson sector  @xcite with different masses @xmath79 for the higgses @xmath80 and @xmath81 , as well as non - universalities in the scalar sector .",
    "radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry naturally allows tev size scalars without the necessity of excessive fine tuning . to illustrate this phenomenon we consider the generic form of the radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry ( rewsb ) which can be written in the form @xmath82 with a redefinition of parameters one can write this equation in the form @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85",
    ". to simplify matters one can go the renormatlization group ( rg ) scale @xmath86 where the loop contribution is minimized ( and ideally vanishes ) . in this case",
    "we can use the tree part of the rewsb reliably . typically @xmath87 are all positive which implies that the soft parameters sit on the surface of an ellipsoid given by the rewsb equation . thus for fixed @xmath75 none of the soft parameters can get too large .",
    "one may call this the ellipsoidal branch  @xcite .",
    "suppose now that for certain choices of the inputs such as the top yukawa , @xmath71 , the gauge couplings etc .",
    ", that the co - efficient @xmath88 turns negative . in this case large value of @xmath89 can occur due to the possibility of cancellation of the @xmath88 term with the rest of the terms in rewsb .",
    "this is the hyperbolic branch  @xcite which contains the focal point ( hb / fp ) , focal curves ( hb / fc ) , and focal surfaces ( hb / fs ) .",
    "the focal point corresponds to the case when @xmath88 vanishes  @xcite , focal curves are when two parameters get large , i.e. , @xmath90 ( hb / fc1 ) or @xmath91 ( hb / fc2 ) , and focal surfaces ( hb / fs ) occur when all the three soft parameters @xmath92 get large while @xmath75 remains fixed and small . in all these cases",
    "one finds that large scalar masses exist . using the lhc constraints the hb / fp region",
    "is seen to be depleted @xcite while most of the remaining parameter space appears to lie on focal curves and focal surfaces  @xcite .",
    "in supergravity models the neutralino is the lightest r parity odd particle over most of the parameter space of the model and with r parity it is a possible candidate for dark matter .",
    "the annihilation of dark matter proceeds via the @xmath93 and the higgs poles ( @xmath94 ) in the s - channel and via the sfermion exchange in the t - channel .",
    "thus the relic density is sensitive to the higgs masses as well as to the masses of the sfermions .",
    "similarly , the spin independent neutralino - proton cross - section arises from the scattering of the neutralino from quarks in a nucleus and the scattering proceeds via squark poles in the s - channel and via the @xmath95 poles in the t - channel .",
    "consequently again the spin independent neutralino - proton cross - section is sensitive to the scale of squark masses and to the higgs masses .",
    "thus one might ask as to the impact of the lightest higgs mass at 125 gev on dark matter . as discussed above , the direct implication of a 125 gev higgs mass is to raise the scale of supersymmetry .",
    "the larger scale leads to heavier sfermion masses which implies that the relic density will be governed mostly by the s - channel z and higgs poles and by coannihilation .",
    "analogously the spin independent neutralino - proton cross - section will be largely governed by the t - channel z and higgs pole exchanges .",
    "these constraints lead to further limits on the allowed parameter space of the model consistent with wmap  @xcite . in this context",
    "we mention that often the upper limit wmap constraint is imposed so as to allow for the possibility of multicomponent dark matter  @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the higgs constraint on the spin independent neutralino - proton cross - section was given in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) and it is found that most of the allowed parameter space of msugra model lies between the current sensitivity of the xenon100 experiment  @xcite and the expected sensitivity in the xenon-1 t  @xcite and supercdms  @xcite .",
    "thus the prospects for the discovery of dark matter look bright if the proposed sensitivities in the new generation of dark matter experiments can be reached .",
    "the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xmath96 is a sensitive test of new physics . in supersymetric models",
    "@xmath96 can receive important contributions from supersymmetric loops . in the standard model electroweak contributions arise from the exchange of the w and z boson .",
    "analogously in supersymmtric models one has contributions arising from the exchange of charginos and sneutrinos , and from the exchange of neutralinos and smuons  @xcite .",
    "if the sparticle spectrum is light , one finds that these contributions can be comparable to or even exceed the standard model contribution . the experimental determination of the correction to @xmath96 or to @xmath97 defined by @xmath98 , i.e.",
    ", @xmath99 is sensitively dependent on the hadronic corrections in the standard model .",
    "thus there are two main estimations of the hadronic error : one using the @xmath100 annihilation and the other using @xmath16 decay .",
    "the analysis using @xmath100 estimation of hadronic corrections gives  @xcite @xmath101 which is a @xmath102 deviation from the standard model , while the analysis using @xmath16 decay gives  @xcite @xmath103 which is @xmath104 deviation from the standard model result .",
    "as discussed above the high higgs mass leads to a high scale for the sfermions and with universal boundary conditions on soft parameters they lead to a rather small correction to @xmath97 .",
    "thus there is a tension between the @xmath96 experimental result and the high higgs mass . assuming the @xmath96 result does not undergo further oscillations",
    ", this tension could be relieved if one assumes that part of the higgs mass arises from sources other than from mssm .",
    "thus extra matter could give additional contribution to the higgs mass  @xcite effectively lowering the component of the higgs mass arising from mssm which would allow an @xmath97 correction consistent with experiment .",
    "similarly , the presence of an extra gauge group under which the higgs is charged would lead to a contribution from the d term to the higgs mass again effectively lowering the mssm higgs mass . yet",
    "another possibility is that @xmath96 contribution arises from new physics other than susy .",
    "thus , for example , a @xmath105 which couples to the muon will produce a contribution to @xmath97 .",
    "for , instance a @xmath105 arising from a gauged @xmath106 can have a significantly lower mass than the current experimental limits on a generic @xmath105 and can generate a correction to @xmath96 of the right size  @xcite ( see the discussion in sec.7 ) .",
    "an interesting cosmic coincidences is the fact that the ratio of dark matter to baryonic matter is roughly 5 , or more precisely @xmath107  @xcite .",
    "the fact that they are about the same size points to a possible common origin for them .",
    "the so called asymmetric dark matter ( asydm ) idea proposes that dark matter originated from baryonic matter in the early universe by the transfer of a net @xmath0 charge from the visible sector to the dark sector  @xcite ( for a review see  @xcite ) .",
    "the implementation of this idea has two basic ingredients : first is to find a mechanism for the transfer of @xmath0 from the visible sector to the dark sector , and second to find a mechanism to deplete the symmetric component of dark matter produced by thermal processes .",
    "the standard procedure for the transfer of @xmath0 from the visible sector to the dark sector is to consider an interactions of the type  @xcite @xmath108 which is operative at temperatures @xmath109 so that @xmath110 where @xmath111 is constituted of only standard model particles and @xmath112 is constituted of dark matter fields and they have opposite @xmath0 charges so that overall the interaction is @xmath0 charge neutral .",
    "concerning the depletion of the symmetric component of dark matter , one needs a mechanism for an efficient annihilation of the thermally produced dark matter .",
    "+ the early universe can be viewed as a weakly interacting plasma in which each particle carries a chemical potential @xmath113 .",
    "in such a plasma the particle - anti - particle asymmetries are given by @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the degrees of freedom , and @xmath116 .",
    "the chemical potentials are constrained by ( i)sphaleron interactions , ( ii ) conservation of charge and hypercharge , ( iii ) yukawa and gauge interactions .",
    "when the transfer interaction is in equilibrium ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , one can solve for the ratio @xmath117 so that @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the dark matter number density and @xmath120 is the baryon number density .",
    "one can generate a variety of models such as models where the visible sector is taken to be the standard model , the two higgs doublet model , or the mssm  @xcite .",
    "for the mssm many variations are possible depending on the scale of sparticle masses . for each model",
    "there are various interactions that allow a transfer of the @xmath0 asymmetry from the standard model sector to the dark matter sector .",
    "the relic density in asydm will have two components : a thermal and a non - thermal component .",
    "thus one may write the total as a sum @xmath121 .",
    "for asydm to work we need @xmath122 .",
    "thus we need an efficient mechanism for the annihilation of thermally produced dark matter .",
    "we accomplish this via the exchange of a gauge field using the stueckelberg  formalism where the gauge field couples to @xmath123  @xcite . in the unitary gauge the massive vector boson field",
    "will be called @xmath105 and its interaction with fermions is given by @xmath124 where @xmath125 runs over @xmath75 and @xmath16 families and @xmath126 .",
    "the lep constraints on the @xmath127 mass are not valid since @xmath105 does not couple with the first generation leptons .",
    "this result also holds at the loop level to a good approximation .",
    "the strongest constraint comes from @xmath96 .",
    "thus the correction to @xmath96 arising from the exchange of @xmath105 boson associated with the @xmath106 symmetry is given by @xmath128 imposing the constraints @xmath129 one finds the restriction @xmath130 the above constraint allows for a low lying @xmath105 which couples only to muons and taus and allows for a rapid annihilation of symmetric dark matter via the @xmath105 pole .",
    "+ to obtain relic densities at current temperatures for @xmath131 and @xmath132 one must solve the boltzman equations in the presence of asymmetries .",
    "the boltzmann equations obeyed by @xmath133 and @xmath134 take the form @xmath135 @xmath136 where @xmath137 and @xmath138 where h is the entropy degrees of freedom .",
    "one finds that @xmath139 is a constant independent of temperature .",
    "the relic densities for @xmath131 and @xmath132 are then given by @xmath140 as @xmath141 , where @xmath142 and where @xmath143 is a numerical constant and @xmath144 .",
    "similarly , @xmath145 as @xmath141 .",
    "we need to show that @xmath146 and that @xmath147 is the major component of wmap .",
    "this has been exhibited explicitly in  @xcite .",
    "we discuss now collider implications of the model . in a muon collider there would be final states with muons and taus and their neutrinos but no @xmath100 final states providing a smoking gun signature for the model  @xcite .",
    "the analysis is done including one loop corrections arising from the first and the second generation leptons in the loop .",
    "one can carry out a direct extension of asydm to the supersymmetric case .",
    "the basic interaction responsible for the asymmetry has the form @xmath148 in general there are many possibilities for the operators @xmath149 such as @xmath150 or any product thereof",
    ". obviously @xmath151 will carry the opposite quantum numbers to those of @xmath149 . in this case",
    "there are two dark matter particles , i.e. , @xmath131 and the neutralino @xmath152 and here the total relic density is @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the relic density from the neutralino .",
    "one must show that the neutralino contribution is subdominant , i.e. , it is no more than 10% of the wmap value .",
    "an interesting question is if a subdominant neutralino is detectable .",
    "this appears to be the case as demonstrated in  @xcite .",
    "r parity is needed to get rid of baryon and lepton number violating dimension 4 operators which can generate unacceptably fast proton decay . within mssm r parity is ad hoc .",
    "further , r parity as a global symmetry is not desirable since it can be broken by wormhole effects .",
    "this problem can be evaded if a model possesses a gauge symmetry so that @xmath155 parity arises as a discrete remnant of this gauge symmetry ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . since @xmath156",
    "the obvious extended symmetry is @xmath157 . in this case",
    "the @xmath158 gauge symmetry will forbid r parity violating interactions such as @xmath159 .",
    "now an unbroken @xmath158 gauge symmetry is undesirable since there would be associated with it a massless gauge boson which can generate an unacceptable long range force and thus one must generate a mass for the @xmath0 gauge boson . if the @xmath0 gauge symmetry is broken spontaneously , r parity is no longer guaranteed .",
    "specifically r parity is protected if @xmath160 is an even integer but is not protected if @xmath160 is an odd integer . to illustrate this point in a specific example",
    "one may consider an extension of mssm with a @xmath158 symmetry which includes three right handed neutrinos fields @xmath161 for anomaly cancellation .",
    "the extended superpotential in this case is @xmath162 where the new fields are assigned the @xmath0 quantum numbers as @xmath163 . since the @xmath0 of the @xmath164 field is even , a vev growth for it will not violate r parity .",
    "however , the vev growth for @xmath161 for which @xmath0 is odd , will violate r parity .",
    "it turns out that the latter possibility can be realized in radiative breaking .",
    "this is so because the beta functions due to the coupling of the @xmath164 and @xmath161 can turn the mass of @xmath161 tachyonic which leads to a vev growth for @xmath161 and a violation of r parity  @xcite . +",
    "a violation of r parity by the @xmath161 vev growth can be avoided if one uses the stueckelberg  mechanism  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) for the mass growth of the @xmath0 gauge boson rather than spontaneous breaking .",
    "specifically let us assume a stueckelberg  mechanism for the @xmath0 gauge boson mass growth with the additional assumptions @xmath165 which are just the conditions for charge conservation .",
    "since @xmath166 and @xmath167 belong to the same @xmath77 multiplet , the vanishing of @xmath168 also implies the vanishing of @xmath169 , i.e. , @xmath170 since the rg evolution of @xmath171 and of @xmath172 are very similar .",
    "it then follows after integrating over the remaining stueckelberg  fields that the scalar potential takes the form @xmath173 ( \\tilde \\nu^{c\\dag } \\tilde\\nu^c)^2.$ ] in this case there are no beta functions to turn @xmath174 negative in the renormalization group evolution . as a consequently the potential can not support spontaneous breaking to generate a vev of @xmath175 and @xmath176 . thus with the stueckelberg  mechanism the @xmath0 gauge boson gains a mass but r parity remains unbroken .",
    "+ we discuss now briefly proton decay . while r parity can eliminate baryon and lepton number violating dimension 4 operators , baryon and lepton number violating dimension five and dimension six operators do exist in unified models .",
    "the baryon and lepton number violating dimension five operators arise from color higgsino exchange while the baryon and lepton number violating dimension six operators arise from the exchange of lepto - quarks .",
    "the baryon and lepton number violating dimension six operators lead to the dominant proton decay mode @xmath177 and estimates give a lifetime which could be in the @xmath178 yrs range ( for a recent review see  @xcite ) . the current experimental limit from superkamiokande for this mode is @xmath179 .",
    "it is expected that at hyper - kamiokande  @xcite one will reach the limit @xmath180 , and thus there is a chance for the observation of the @xmath181 mode .",
    "proton decay from baryon and lepton number violating dimension five operators is more model dependent . thus the baryon and lepton number violating dimension five operators must be dressed by chargino , gluino , and neutralino exchanges to produce baryon and lepton number violating dimension six operators responsible for proton decay .",
    "since the sparticle spectrum enters in the dressing loops , the proton lifetime is dependent on the nature of the sparticle spectrum as well on cp phases ( for a review see  @xcite ) and thus proton decay provides a test of models of strings and branes via proton decay branching ratios ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite,@xcite ) . specifically a light sparticle spectrum will lead to a shorter proton decay while a heavier spectrum will lead to a longer proton decay lifetime . the current experimental limit on p decay from superkamiokande gives @xmath182 which puts severe constraints on supersymmetric models .",
    "these constraints can be relieved either by gut models which invoke a cancellation mechanism for the baryon and lepton number violating dimension five operators or a heavy sparticle spectrum .",
    "the data from the large hadron collider which indicates that the scale of susy breaking for the scalar sector may be large helps stabilize the proton against too fast a decay from dimension five operators .",
    "it is expected that hyper - kamiokande  @xcite will reach a sensitivity of @xmath183 for the @xmath184 mode . in any case proton decay from dimension",
    "five operators could become visible even with modest increase in sensitivity for the detection of this mode in the future .",
    "we have given a brief summary of the current status of supergravity grand unification .",
    "a very significant constraint on the model arises from the recent discovery of the higgs boson by the atlas and cms detectors and the determination that the mass of the higgs is high , i.e. , around 125 gev .",
    "it has been known for some time that in msugra the mass of the higgs must lie below 130 gev , and thus it is interesting that the mass of the higgs as determined by experiment lies below the predicted limit .",
    "however , the high mass of the higgs implies typically that the average mass of the stops must be significantly large and further that the trilinear coupling @xmath70 typically must be large .",
    "these results imply that the part of the parameter space of msugra which gives rise to the large higgs mass would lie on the hyperbolic branch of radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry and more specifically on focal curves or focal surfaces . a theoretical analysis using the higgs mass as a constraint also implies that there is a significant region of the parameter space consistent with all experimental constraints where the gaugino masses are relatively light .",
    "additionally in some restricted regions of the parameter space on may also have relatively light stops and staus .",
    "thus several light sparticles appear to be prime candidates for discovery at the lhc .",
    "these include the neutralino , the chargino , the gluino , and the stop .",
    "another implication of the heavy higgs mass pertains to neutralino dark matter .",
    "the higgs mass constraint significantly restricts the allowed range of the spin independent neutralino - proton cross section .",
    "interestingly most of the allowed range lies between the current sensitivity of the xenon100 and the expected sensitivity of xenon-1 t and supercdms experiments .",
    "this result is very encouraging for the discovery of supersymmetric dark matter .",
    "the issue of the @xmath96 constraint was also discussed .",
    "the excess of @xmath96 over the standard model result is dependent on the hadronic corrections .",
    "the @xmath100 annihilation data and the @xmath16 decay data give somewhat different results for this quantity leading to either @xmath185 or @xmath104 discrepancy .",
    "if the deviation from the standard model stays there would be tension between the @xmath96 result and the high higgs mass in models with universal boundary conditions on the soft parameters .",
    "this tension can be relieved in several ways , such as by having part of the higgs mass arise from extra matter at the loop level , or from d terms if there is an extra gauge group under which the higgs is charged .",
    "alternately flavored supergravity models with non - universalities in the flavor sector could account for the discrepancy .",
    "+ also discussed was the status of grand unification .",
    "currently @xmath34 is the favored group for the unification of the electroweak and the strong interactions .",
    "@xmath34 has the advantage over @xmath48 in that it unifies a full generation of quarks and leptons in a single 16-plet representation .",
    "however , the current models based on @xmath34 suffer from a couple of drawbacks .",
    "the first one concerns the breaking of the gut group .",
    "here in conventional models more than one scale enters in the breaking of the group .",
    "thus one scale enters in reducing the rank and the other to break the symmetry all the way down to the standard model gauge group .",
    "this drawback can be overcome if one considers @xmath186 of higgs whose vev formation can break the group down to the standard model gauge group in one step .",
    "a second draw back which is a generic problem in gut models concerns the doublet - triple splitting problem . a new class of @xmath34 models using @xmath187 of higgs fields not only break the gauge symmetry at one scale they also solve the doublet - triplet problem by the missing partner mechanism .",
    "further , work using these models is thus desirable .",
    "the baryon and lepton number violating dimension five and dimension six operatos which give rise to proton decay and the prospects for the discovery of proton decay in future experiments were discussed .",
    "finally we discussed the so called cosmic coincidence which pertains to the fact that the dark matter and the baryonic matter are in the ratio @xmath188 .",
    "the realization of this possibility in the context of superymmetry was discussed in a multicomponent dark matter framework consisting of a dirac fermion ( carrying @xmath0 charge ) and a majorana fermion ( the neutralino ) . +",

    "<S> a brief review is given of recent developments related to the higgs signal and its implications for supersymmetry in the supergravity grand unification framework . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs data indicates that the allowed parameter space largely lies on focal curves and focal surfaces of the hyperbolic branch of radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry where tev size scalars naturally arise . </S>",
    "<S> the high mass of the higgs leads to a more precise prediction for the allowed range of the spin independent neutralino - proton cross - section which is encouraging for the detection of dark matter in future experiments with greater sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> also discussed is the status of grand unification and a natural solution to breaking the gut group at one scale and resolving the doublet - triplet problem . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the cosmic coincidence can be compatible within a supersymmetric framework in a muticomponent dark matter picture with one component charged under @xmath0 while the other component is the conventional supersymmetric dark matter candidate , the neutralino . </S>"
