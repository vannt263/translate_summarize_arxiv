    "at the expected location we detect a redshifted  k - line at @xmath47 significance level in the afterglow+galaxy spectrum ( @xmath48 in the afterglow only ) , while the  h - line only at @xmath49 ( and @xmath50 .",

    "our second and third imaging epochs do not show any clear sign of the afterglow either in the single exposures nor in coadded ones . assuming that the afterglow completely faded below our detection limit at @xmath52 days we subtract from our first epoch of imaging this `` reference '' to measure the afterglow flux at the time of our initial observation . using the hotpants code and nearby point sources from sdss for calibration , we measure the following , extinction corrected , ab magnitudes : @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "we derive , at @xmath55 days , an afterglow brightness of @xmath56 , after correcting for galactic extinction ( @xmath57(b - v ) = 0.02 ) : this value is similar to other optically - detected short grbs observed around the same epoch @xcite .",
    "moreover , using the data from june 16 as a `` reference '' does not change these results , while a similar procedure operated between our second and third epochs , allows us to place stringent upper limits on the afterglow brightness at @xmath58 days ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) , confirming our assumption that indeed the optical afterglow was undetectable by gemini .",
    "interestingly , almost at similar time of our latest gemini observation , a near - ir counterpart was still visible in the @xmath61 data as reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the peak of the galaxy emission and the centroid of the afterglow emission derived from the subtracted image ( see last panel on the right in fig .",
    "[ fig : finder ] ) are separated by @xmath62 , corresponding to a projected distance of 4.8kpc ( @xmath35 ) at @xmath3 . at this redshift",
    "the probability of a random association between the galaxy and the grb at such distance @xmath63 is very small ( @xmath64 ; see also * ? ? ?",

    "therefore , using our second epoch observations we derive = 20.76 @xmath68mag for the grb host and we estimate a rest - frame , @xmath69-corrected , absolute @xmath70-band magnitude ( ab ) of @xmath71 . despite the brightness of this galaxy ( @xmath72 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the derived luminosity is not unusual among the short - grb hosts population ( figure [ fig : sfr ] , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . using the late - time multiband photometry and the idl package _ kcorrect _ @xcite in a similar fashion to @xcite we estimate the mass of the host galaxy as @xmath73 .    the gmos spectra from the first two nights and",
    "the deimos data cover key nebular emission lines .",
    "we measured the fluxes of these lines using the latter data , but for the ones also detected in the gmos spectra we obtain similar results ( table  [ tab : host ] ) .",
    "we apply standard emission - line analysis to derive intrinsic galaxy properties .",
    "we have estimated the optical extinction using the balmer lines decrement and assuming case - b recombination @xcite : we derived e(b - v ) = 0.43 ( @xmath74 mag , assuming a milky - way extinction curve ) . using the calibration of @xcite ,",
    "the [ oii ] line luminosity gives a sfr([oii ] )  @xmath75 yr@xmath22 .",
    "similarly , from the  luminosity we derive sfr ( ) @xmath76 @xmath5 . together with the @xmath70-band lumiosity , we derive a specific sfr : ssfr = sfr@xmath77 yr@xmath78 . as in other many short grb hosts ,",
    "this value is consistent with a star - forming galaxy ( see fig.[fig : sfr ] , berger 2009 ) .",
    "also , collisionally - excited oxygen and the  and  balmer series recombination lines provide an estimate of the gas - phase oxygen abundances of the host galaxy .",
    "we adopt the @xmath79)/@xmath80 metallicity indicator @xcite , which depends on both the metallicity and the ionization state of the gas .",
    "to help disentangle a degeneracy in the values , we use the @xmath81 indicator ( @xmath82/@xmath83 ) .",
    "however , our measured fluxes still allow for two solutions : @xmath84 for the upper @xmath85 branch and @xmath86 for the lower branch .",
    "the typical error in this measurement , due to systematic uncertainty in the calibration of these metallicity relations is typically @xmath87 dex .",
    "no field galaxy at @xmath88 with a similar brightness to  exhibits metallicities consistent with the lower - branch of our @xmath85 analysis .",
    "furthermore , based on the detection of  and @xmath89 lines in the deimos spectrum we place a lower limit on the metallicity of 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath90 .",
    "so we can conclude the galaxy has approximately solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "grb130603b marks one of the best cases in which , for a short grb , an afterglow - dominated spectrum has been obtained .",
    "overall , the extracted grb afterglow spectrum presents a smooth , almost featureless continuum ( figure [ fig : comparis ] lower panels ) . despite the absence of strong spectral features",
    ", we can still constrain the grb redshift from these data alone : 1 ) the lack of a  forest requires that the grb exploded at @xmath91 ; 2 ) the appearance of weak h+k absorption lines ( see figure [ fig : hk ] ) as also seen by @xcite and @xcite , gives a strong indication that the grb redshift is at least a the the emission line redshift ( @xmath92 ) ; 3 ) if one assumes the afterglow spectrum will exhibit significant ( @xmath93 )  absorption from the surrounding interstellar or circumgalactic medium then we set an upper limit @xmath94 based on its non - detection .",
    "all of these constraints are consistent with  having occurred within the coincident galaxy .",
    "ultimately , an indisputable measurement of @xmath95 from an afterglow spectrum may require the detection of fine - structure transitions excited by the grb itself @xcite and/or the observed termination of the  forest .",
    "unfortunately , our wavelength coverage and the small number of this kind of features that would have been redshifted in our observed window ( and therefore detected ) prevent us to obtain such a secure measurement .",
    "furthermore , analysis of these transitions would reveal physical properties of the progenitor environment ( e.g.  metallicity , size ) and may offer new insight into the progenitors of sgrbs .    associating  to the neighboring galaxy , we may place an upper limit to the star - formation rate at the position of the event .",
    "no strong emission lines are identified , in contrast to the putative host spectrum : the striking difference can be seen at the location of the  and @xmath424959,5007 lines ( insets in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparis ] ) .",
    "this indicates that , unlike the majority of long - duration grbs , exploded in a region of very minimal , if not negligible , star - formation .",
    "based on the integrated flux at the location of the  line , we place an upper limit sfr ( ) @xmath96 yr@xmath22 .",

    "we repeated similar observations the following night .    based on our absorption lines analysis and the very small probability of a random association with such a bright galaxy ( @xmath97=0.00064 )",
    "we conclude that this is the host of .",
    "our optical images provide firm evidence that this event occurred in the outskirt of a star - forming galaxy ( @xmath98 ) , around 4.8kpc from its center ( at the grb redshift of @xmath99 ) . while this offset is not unusual for long duration grbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the lack of blue light at the location is very unlike long - duration grb locations @xcite .",
    "deep @xmath61 observations also confirm this findings @xcite .",
    "the early - time spectra present a bright afterglow continuum superimposed upon a fainter galaxy .",
    "this represents one of the few cases where an afterglow - dominated spectrum for a short grb has been recorded .",
    "the host is an @xmath72 galaxy , and the spectrum shows strong nebular emission lines as well as recombination features .",
    "we measure a dust - corrected sfr @xmath76@xmath5 and solar metallicity .",
    "nevertheless , we were able to extract the grb spectrum and constrain the properties of the host galaxy at its location : the grb spectrum present a smooth continuum showing almost no sign of emission lines throughout the wavelength coverage .",
    "also , at the same redshift we identify  absorption lines , which place a strong constraint to the grb redshift , despite the lack of fine - structure transitions .",
    "therefore , at the grb location , the star - formation activity is almost negligible ( sfr ( ) @xmath96 yr@xmath22 ) .",
    "this last result , once more , emphasizes the importance of rapid follow - up observations with large aperture facilities in order to firmly identify the faint afterglows of these short - lived events . only with a larger sample of data similar to those presented in this work",
