    "the most commonly used technique for attempting to approximate the spectrum of a linear operator is the finite - section method : we choose a finite - dimensional subspace @xmath8 with corresponding orthogonal projection @xmath9 , and calculate the eigenvalues of @xmath10 . if @xmath11 is a sequence of finite - dimensional subspaces such that the corresponding orthogonal projections @xmath12 converge strongly to the identity operator , then we write @xmath13 .",
    "for such a sequence we define the following limit set @xmath14 for a bounded self - adjoint operator we have @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the closed convex hull ( see for example ( * ? ? ? * theorem 6.1 ) ) .",
    "that the limit set contains @xmath3 is encouraging ; however , this containment can be strict .",
    "we say that a @xmath17 is a point of spectral pollution for @xmath13 if @xmath18 belongs to the limit set .",
    "this constitutes a serious problem since spectral pollution can occur anywhere inside a gap in the essential spectrum ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.1 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.1 ) , ( * ? ? ? * theorem 6.1 ) ) .",
    "consequently , the finite - section method often fails to identify eigenvalues in such gaps ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the situation for normal operators can be far worse as the following example shows .",
    "[ ex1]let @xmath0 be the bilateral shift operator acting on @xmath19 : @xmath20 the operator @xmath0 is unitary and @xmath21 .",

    "the method can be traced back to @xcite and has been successfully applied to self - adjoint operators from solid state physics @xcite , relativistic quantum mechanics @xcite , stokes systems @xcite , and magnetohydrodynamics @xcite . applying this method to normal operators",
    "does not seem encouraging as the following example shows .",

    "the solutions to the quadratic eigenvalue problem @xmath45 have received very little attention ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the failure in example [ ex2 ] of the solutions to converge to any points in the spectrum of the operator is highly unsatisfactory and motivates the following definition .",

    "the second order spectrum of @xmath0 relative to @xmath8 is the set @xmath46    this is a generalisation of the definition which appears in @xcite for self - adjoint operators .",
    "if @xmath0 is bounded , then the second order spectrum of @xmath0 relative to @xmath8 is precisely the solutions to the quadratic eigenvalue problem @xmath47 for @xmath31 .",
    "we note that for non - self - adjoint operators this definition differs from that which appears in @xcite .",
    "in section 2 we discuss some geometric issues which will cast light on the geometry of the second order relative spectrum . in section 3",
    "we linearise the quadratic eigenvalue problem which arises from definition [ eugenelevitin ] . by doing this we are better able to understand how and why the method converges to both eigenvalues and eigenspaces . in section 4",
