    "<S> cooperative phenomena arising due to the coupling of individual atoms via the radiation field are a cornerstone of modern quantum and optical physics . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments on x - ray quantum optics added a new twist to this line of research by exploiting superradiance in order to construct artificial quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> however , so far , systematic approaches to deliberately design superradiance properties are lacking , impeding the desired implementation of more advanced quantum optical schemes . here </S>",
    "<S> , we develop an analytical framework for the engineering of single - photon superradiance in extended media applicable across the entire electromagnetic spectrum , and show how it can be used to tailor the properties of an artificial quantum system . </S>",
    "<S> this `` reverse engineering '' of superradiance not only provides an avenue towards non - linear and quantum mechanical phenomena at x - ray energies , but also leads to a unified view on and a better understanding of superradiance across different physical systems .    </S>",
    "<S> a single atom coupled to an environment is usually subject to spontaneous emission and experiences a frequency shift referred to as the lamb shift . in an aggregation of atoms coupled via the radiation field , collective effects </S>",
    "<S> can significantly alter the properties compared to a single emitter . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , this was realised by dicke @xcite , who showed that  @xmath0 identical atoms confined to a volume much smaller than a wavelength cubed collectively behave as one `` super atom '' . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to exaggerated properties such as an acceleration of spontaneous decay by a factor of @xmath1 ( known as superradiance ) or an enhanced frequency shift ( sometimes also termed `` collective lamb shift '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> recently , also the correlated emission from _ extended _ ensembles of emitters has become the focus of experimental and theoretical @xcite investigations , where either the system size and/or the minimal interatomic distance  @xmath2 exceeds the scale of the characteristic wavelength @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the systems considered cover a wide range of possible realisations , including atoms near a nanofiber  @xcite , thin vapor layers  @xcite , cold atomic ensembles  @xcite , or thin - film cavities with embedded mssbauer nuclei in the realm of x - ray quantum optics  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the present work is motivated by the observation that in particular the latter experiments in the field of nuclear quantum optics exploited a deliberate control of superradiance properties , going beyond a mere characterisation . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the observation of electromagnetically induced transparency at x - ray frequencies  @xcite was enabled by the engineering of two distinct ensembles with different superradiance properties in a single sample . </S>",
    "<S> another example is the implementation of spontaneously generated coherences  @xcite , which relied on the realization of a spatially anisotropic electromagnetic environment via superradiance . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> superradiance was employed to design an artificial quantum system , which in turn enabled the observation of the desired effect .    </S>",
    "<S> this raises the question whether a systematic and constructive approach could be established to exploit superradiance for the design of artificial quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> such design capabilities could overcome the limited resources accessible in state - of - the - art experiments , and thereby enable more advanced level schemes required , e.g. , for the exploration of non - linear and quantum effects at x - ray energies .    here , we address this question by developing an analytical framework for superradiance in extended media encompassing different system dimensionalities , interatomic couplings , and environments . as our main result , </S>",
    "<S> we then derive expressions describing how collective decay rates and frequency shifts can be controlled in extended media , and show how they can be used for the design of an artificial optical transition .    </S>",
    "<S> we start with a single two - level atom ( bare transition frequency @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the speed of light ) which is embedded in an electromagnetic environment ( , free space ) and is characterised by its spontaneous decay rate @xmath7 ( assuming markovian reservoirs  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling to the environment also results in a frequency shift @xmath8 ( single - atom lamb shift ) . in the presence of an identical , second atom , photons </S>",
    "<S> can be exchanged between the two atoms . </S>",
    "<S> due to irreversible loss to the reservoir , the inter - atomic coupling @xmath9 is complex  @xcite . here , @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath11 ) represents the real - valued cross - damping ( cross - coupling ) term for two atoms located at positions @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . considering all pair - wise couplings in an ensemble of @xmath14 atoms , we find  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the complex eigenenergy of the collective single - excitation atomic state @xmath17 ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 signify the atomic raising operator for atom  @xmath20 and the vacuum state , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ eq : eigenproblem ] ) is valid for all dimensions @xmath21 of the atomic arrangement and for all ( physically reasonable ) couplings @xmath22 . </S>",

    "<S> * a @xmath21-dimensional lattice of atoms is embedded into an electromagnetic reservoir that mediates an inter - atomic coupling @xmath25 , where atoms are separated by a distance @xmath26 and the coefficient @xmath27 characterises the distance - dependence ( see eq .  ( [ eq : gencoupling ] ) ) . we show that the resulting collective eigenstates can be utilised for the implementation of an artificial transition with tunable decay rate and transition frequency . ]    in dicke s small - volume limit , all atoms couple to each other with equal strength , leading to a collective decay rate @xmath28 and a frequency shift @xmath29 with an enhancement factor @xmath30 ( see methods ) . to describe an extended sample , we consider ordered atomic arrangements , and focus on chains ( @xmath31 ) , square lattices </S>",

    "<S> such ordered arrays are naturally provided by crystalline samples ( , solid state targets employed in x - ray quantum optics  @xcite , optical lattices of atoms  @xcite , or atom  cavity networks  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we consider a generic class of inter - atomic couplings @xmath34 which depend on the distance @xmath26 between atom pairs . here </S>",
