    "this theory has several pleasing features .",
    "there are no dimensionful parameters , so all of those arise from a unique source , namely the gauge fixing of the weyl symmetry such as , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a dimensionful constant of the order of the planck scale",
    ". then the gravitational constant is @xmath19 , the electroweak scale is @xmath20 while dark energy , and masses for quarks , leptons , gauge bosons , neutrinos and dark matter arise from interactions with the scalars @xmath21 the hierarchy of mass scales is put in by hand through a hierarchy of dimensionless parameters . a deeper theory is needed to explain this hierarchy , but in the present effective theory it is at least possible to maintain it under renormalization since dimensionless constants receive only logarithmic quantum corrections ( no need for low energy supersymmetry for the purpose of naturalness ) . to preserve the local scale symmetry in the quantum theory",
    "one must adopt a weyl invariant renormalization scheme in which @xmath22 is the only renormalization scale , and consequently dimensionless constants receive only weyl invariant logarithmic renormalizations of the form @xmath23 etc .",
    "with such a renormalization scheme the scale anomaly of all matter cancels against the scale anomaly of @xmath22 @xcite , thus not spoiling the local symmetry .",
    "then the unbroken weyl symmetry in the renormalized theory plays a central role in explaining the smallness of dark energy as shown in @xcite .",
    "this also suggests a definite relation between the electroweak vacuum and dark energy both of which fill the entire universe .",
    "the scalar @xmath22 is compensated by the weyl symmetry , so @xmath22 is not a true additional physical degree of freedom but , as a conformally coupled scalar , participates in an important structure of the weyl symmetry that has further physical consequences involving antigravity spacetime regions in cosmology and black holes as discussed in the following sections .",
    "the structure of interest , that leads to the central discussion in the rest of this paper , is the relative minus sign in @xmath24 and in the scalar kinetic terms in ( [ action ] ) .",
    "these signs are compulsory and play an important role in the geodesic completeness of the theory . with the given sign patterns , @xmath10 has the correct sign for its kinetic term but @xmath22 has the wrong sign . if @xmath22 had the same sign of kinetic energy as @xmath25 then the conformal coupling to @xmath26 would become purely negative which would lead to a negative gravitational constant .",
    "so , to generate a positive gravitational constant , @xmath22 must come with the opposite sign to @xmath27 this makes @xmath22 a ghost , but this is harmless since the weyl symmetry can remove this ghost by a gauge fixing .",
    "this scheme has a straightforward generalization to supersymmetry / supergravity and grand unification , but all scalars @xmath28 must be conformally coupled , @xmath29 although some generalization is permitted as long as the geodesically complete feature ( related to signs ) is maintained @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we point out that in all supergravity theories , the curvature term has the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the khler potential and @xmath32 represents the einstein - hilbert term @xcite .",
    "this is again of the form @xmath33 with complex @xmath34 where a complex version of @xmath22 has been gauge fixed to 1 in a weyl invariant formulation of supergravity @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "finally we emphasize that the same relative minus sign occurs also in a weyl invariant reformulation of low energy string theory ( st ) but with a different interpretation of @xmath35 related to the dilaton @xcite .",
    "hence the structure @xmath36 is ubiquitous , but was overlooked because it was commonly assumed that the gravitational constant , or an effective structure that replaces it , could not or should not become negative .",
    "at the outset of this approach in 2008 @xcite the immediate question was whether the dynamics would allow @xmath37 to remain always positive .",
    "it was eventually determined by bars , chen , steinhardt and turok , in a series of papers during 2010 - 2012 ( summary in @xcite ) , that the solutions of the field equations that do not switch sign for this quantity are non - generic and of measure zero in the phase space of initial conditions for the fields @xmath38 .",
    "so , according to the dynamics , it is untenable to insist on a limited patch @xmath39 of field space .",
    "by contrast , it was found that the theory becomes geodesically complete when all field configurations are included , thus solving generally the basic problem of geodesic incompleteness .",
    "the other side of the coin is that solving geodesic incompleteness comes with the prediction that there would be antigravity sectors in the theory since the effective gravitational constant that is proportional to @xmath40 would dynamically become negative in some spacetime regions . in view of the pleasing features of the theory outlined in the second paragraph above , these antigravity sectors",
    "must then be taken seriously and the corresponding new physics must be understood . in our investigations",
    "so far , we discovered that the antigravity sectors are geodesically connected to our own gravity sector at gravitational singularities , like the big bang / crunch or black holes , which occur precisely at the same spacetime points where @xmath41 vanishes or goes to infinity .",
    "the related dynamical string tension @xcite @xmath42 goes to zero or infinity simultaneously .",
    "so we need to figure out the physical effects that can be observed in our universe due to the presence of antigravity sectors behind cosmological @xcite and black hole singularities @xcite . after overcoming several conceptual as well as technical challenges",
    "we have been able to discuss some new physics problems and developed new cosmological scenarios that involve an antigravity period in the history of the universe @xcite@xcite .",
    "a remaining conceptual puzzle is an apparent possible instability in the antigravity sector that is addressed and resolved in the remainder of this paper .",
    "our conclusion is that there are no fundamental problems but only interesting physics of crucial significance .",
    "the classical or quantum analysis of this theory is best conducted in a weyl gauge we called the @xmath43-gauge  @xcite@xcite@xcite which amounts to @xmath44 this allows the sign@xmath45 to be determined by the dynamics .",
    "note that the sign is gauge invariant , so if the sign switches dynamically in one gauge it has to also switch in all gauges .",
    "if one wishes to use the traditional einstein gauge  ( e ) or the string gauge  ( s ) one can err by choosing an illegitimate gauge that corresponds to a geodesically incomplete patch , such as@xmath15{l}\\text{e}^{+}\\text{-gauge:\\ } \\frac{1}{12}\\left (   \\phi_{e+}^{2}-s_{e+}^{2}\\right )   = \\frac{+1}{16\\pi g_{n}},\\\\ \\text{s}^{+}\\text{-gauge:\\ } \\frac{d-2}{8\\left (   d-1\\right )   } \\left (   \\phi _ { s+}^{2}-s_{s+}^{2}\\right )   = \\frac{+1}{2\\kappa_{d}^{2}}e^{-2\\phi},\\;\\phi=\\text{dilaton.}\\end{array } \\label{esguages}\\ ] ] the @xmath46 or @xmath35 subscripts on the fields indicate the gauge fixed form of the corresponding field .",
    "if this were all , then there would be nothing new , and the weyl symmetry could be regarded as fake  @xcite . however , the fact is that conventional general relativity and string theory are geodesically incomplete because the gauge choices just shown are valid only in the field patch in which @xmath47 .",
    "the dynamics contradict the assumption of gauge fixing to only the positive patch . in the negative regions one may choose again the einstein or string gauge , but now with a negative gravitational constant , @xmath48 or @xmath49 . in those spacetime regions gravity",
    "is repulsive ( antigravity ) .",
    "the same situation arises in string theory . in the worldsheet formulation of string theory",
    "the string tension is promoted to a background field @xmath50 by connecting it directly to the features of the weyl invariant low energy string theory @xcite .",
    "then the string tension @xmath51 switches sign together with the corresponding gravitational constant @xcite .",
    "thus the weyl symmetric ( sm+gr ) and st predict that , in the einstein or string gauges , one should expect a _ sudden sign switch _ of the effective planck mass @xmath52 at certain spacetime points that typically correspond to singularities ( e.g. big bang , black holes ) encountered in the einstein or string frames .    one may choose better weyl gauges ( e.g. @xmath53-gauge , choose @xmath54 , or @xmath55-gauge , choose @xmath56 constant@xmath57 that cover globally all the positive and negative patches . then",
    "the sign switch of the effective planck mass @xmath58 is smooth rather than abrupt .    however , if one wishes to work in the more familiar einstein or string frames , to recover the geodesically complete theory one must allow for the gravitational constant to switch sign at singularities , and connect solutions for fields across gravity / antigravity patches",
    ". in the @xmath59 einstein gauges shown above , the last term in eq.([action ] ) becomes @xmath60 where the @xmath59 for the gravity / antigravity regions can be absorbed into a redefinition of the signature of the metric , @xmath61 where the _ continuous _",
    "@xmath62 is the geometry in the _ union _ of the gravity / antigravity patches .",
    "the same @xmath59 gauge choice is applied to every term in the sm+gr action in eq.([action ] ) . under the replacement @xmath63 in the _ antigravity sector _",
    "some terms in the action flip sign and some do nt @xcite , e.g. @xmath64 does not , but @xmath12 does as in eq.([pmg ] ) .",
    "one may be concerned that the sign switches of the gravitational constant or the string tension may lead to problems like unitarity or negative kinetic energy ghosts .",
    "we mention that @xcite has already argued that there are no unitarity problems due to sign flips in field / string theories .",
    "there remains the question of possible instability due to negative kinetic energy in the antigravity region .",
    "we show in this paper that its presence is not a problem of principle for observers in the gravity region and that those observers can detect interesting physical effects related to the geodesically connected regions of antigravity .",
    "there is a general impression that negative kinetic energy in field or string theory implies ghosts associated with negative norm states .",
    "it is not generally appreciated that negative norms ( hence negative probabilities ) are automatically avoided by insisting on a strictly unitary quantization of the theory .",
    "this has been illustrated in the quantization of the relativistic harmonic oscillator @xcite with a timelike direction that appears with the opposite sign to the spacelike directions , just like the @xmath22 field as compared to the @xmath10 field in the sm+gr action in eq.([action ] ) .",
    "similar situations occur in the antigravity region where some fields may appear with the wrong sign as described after eq.([pmg ] ) .",
    "the first duty in quantization should be maintaining sanity in the meaning of probability , as in @xcite , by avoiding a quantization procedure that introduces negative norm states .",
    "of course , there exist successful cases , such as string theory in the covariant quantization  procedure , that at first admits negative norms to later kill them by applying constraints that select the positive norm states . in principle , the relativistic oscillators in string theory could also be treated as in @xcite and very likely still recover the same gauge invariant physical states without ever introducing negative norm states in string theory",
    ". it would be preferable to quantize without negative norm states at all from the very beginning .    when there is not enough gauge symmetry to remove a degree of freedom that has the wrong sign of kinetic energy , a unitary quantization procedure like @xcite maintains unitarity .",
    "however , the effect of the negative kinetic energy is to cause an instability ( not unlike a tachyonic mass term , or a bottomless potential , would ) , so that there may not be a ground state for that degree of freedom while it propagates in the antigravity region .",
    "this is the negative kinetic energy issue in the antigravity sector .",
    "perhaps some complete theory as a whole conspires to have a ground state even in antigravity .",
    "although this would be reassuring , it appears that this is not necessary in order to make sense of the physics as detected by observers in the gravity sector .",
    "such observers can verify that the same degree of freedom does have a ground state in the gravity region while they can never experience directly the negative kinetic energy in the antigravity sector .",
    "the only physics questions that make sense for those observers is what can be learned about the existence of antigravity through scattering experiments that involve in / out states as defined in the gravity region . for those questions",
    "the issue of whether there is a ground state in the antigravity region does not matter , but unitarity continues to matter .",
    "therefore we point out how this works in the case of cosmology that admits an antigravity region .",
    "the wheeler de witt ( wdw ) equation is the quantum version of the @xmath65 and @xmath66 component of the einstein equation , @xmath67 this is a constraint applied on physical states in covariant quantization of general relativity @xcite .",
    "the mini superspace  consists of only time dependent ( homogeneous ) scalar fields @xmath68 and the frw metric , @xmath69 with @xmath70 describing spacial curvature and anisotropies , while @xmath71 includes the radiation density , @xmath72 from the action in eq.([action ] ) we can derive a wheeler de witt equation that is invariant under weyl rescalings @xmath73 with a time dependent @xmath74 ; this allows us to choose a gauge . to allow @xmath75 to have any sign dynamically",
    ", we prefer the @xmath53-gauge given by @xmath76 we concentrate here on the simplest frw geometry in the @xmath43-gauge , @xmath77 with no anisotropy or inhomogeneities , but with a positive constant spatial curvature @xmath78 .",
    "this is not realistic , but it is the easiest case to illustrate the unitarity properties of the quantum theory that includes antigravity regions ( more degrees of freedom , and negative or zero @xmath31 would be treated in a similar manner ) .",
    "the mini superspace is just @xmath79 while the constraint @xmath80 derived from ( [ action ] ) is , @xmath81 this is recognized as the hamiltonian for the relativistic harmonic oscillator , @xmath82 with @xmath83 subject to the constraint , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a constant .",
    "note that this hamiltonian contains negative energy for the ( time - like ) @xmath86 degree of freedom .",
    "recall that we have already used up the weyl symmetry so this degree of freedom can not be removed and its negative energy must be dealt with .",
    "the naive quantization of the relativistic harmonic oscillator would introduce negative norm states for the @xmath87 degree of freedom ( as in string theory ) , so it appears there may be trouble with unitarity .",
    "however , this is not the case , because this system ( and similar cases ) can be quantized by respecting unitarity without ever introducing negative norms as shown in @xcite .",
    "this goes as follows : the quantum system obeys the constraint equation @xmath88 this is the wdw equation that takes the form@xmath89 this is recognized as the klein - gordon equation for the quantized relativistic harmonic oscillator .",

    "one defines relativistic creation / annihilation operators @xmath105 and a vacuum state that satisfies @xmath106 then the quantum states at level @xmath107 are given by applying @xmath107 creation operators , @xmath108 the vacuum state is lorentz invariant , while the states at level @xmath107 form a collection of _ finite dimensional _ irreducible representations of the lorentz group .",

    "we contrast this result to ours in eq.([relho ] ) where we have displayed an infinite , rather than finite , number of states and a gaussian factor @xmath115 that converges in all directions , rather than the non - convergent lorentz invariant form @xmath116 there is no lorentz invariant vacuum state . as shown in @xcite , our states in eq.([relho ] ) form an _ infinite dimensional unitary representation _ of the lorentz group for which all the states have positive norm .",
    "furthermore , those that satisfy the constraint have positive total energy , @xmath117 as long as @xmath85 is positive .",
    "however , as seen in eq.([complete ] ) , there are _ off - shell states _ of positive as well as negative energy .",

    ", typically the tension appears together with the metric @xmath352 or antisymmetric tensor @xmath353 in the weyl invariant combination , @xmath354 or @xmath355 the requirement of exact _ worldsheet _ conformal symmetry constrains these target - space weyl invariant combinations .",
    "perturbative worldsheet conformal symmetry ( vanishing beta functions ) is captured by the properties of the low energy effective string action . from the study of the weyl invariant and geodesically complete formalism of the low energy string action",
    "@xcite we have learned that the tension ( closely connected to the gravitational constant ) switches sign generically near the singularities in the classical solutions of this theory .",
    "if we fix the target space weyl symmetry by choosing the string gauge as in eq.([esguages ] ) , then in those generic solutions , the tension becomes @xmath356 on the two sides of the singularity as it appears _ in the string gauge_. those two sides are identified as the gravity / antigravity sectors of the low energy theory as discussed in section ( [ frames ] ) . from the perspective of the worldsheet string theory these observations lead to a simple prescription to capture all these effects in the string gauge , namely replace the weyl invariant structures @xmath357 by @xmath358 where the capital @xmath359 are the background fields on the gravity / antigravity patches that are joined at the singularities _ as they appear in the string gauge_. we may absorb the overall @xmath59 due to the signs of the tension into a redefinition of the background fields , and as we did for the einstein gauge in eq.([g - hat ] ) , define @xmath360 as the full set of background fields in the union of the gravity / antigravity sectors of the worldsheet string theory .",
    "of course , @xmath361 are required to satisfy worldsheet conformal invariance at the quantum level as usual .",
    "what is new is the geodesic completeness of the background fields @xmath362 which is achieved by the sign flipping tension and the union of the corresponding gravity / antigravity sectors .",
    "a simple example of a conformally exact worldsheet cft , that includes a dynamical string tension that flips signs , is the flat string background @xmath363 modified only by a time dependent string tension @xmath364sign@xmath365 this can also be presented in the string gauge by absorbing the sign of the tension into a redefined metric@xmath366 where @xmath345 is a constant .",
    "note the similarity to eq.([hparticle ] ) or sections ( [ nomass],[mass ] ) .",
    "thus the tension is positive when @xmath367 and negative when @xmath368 this is also similar to the cosmological example with an antigravity loop given in @xcite , but we have greatly simplified it here by keeping only the signs but not the magnitude of the tension , thus defining a conformally exact rather than a conformally approximate cft on the worldsheet .",
    "the corresponding worldsheet string model is @xmath369    we should mention that it is also possible to consider a model , at least at the classical level , by inserting in the action ( [ newflatstring ] ) the inverse of the sign function @xmath370 in this case the tension flips sign when it is infinite rather than zero .",
    "both of these possibilities occur smoothly rather than suddenly in cosmological backgrounds in string theory ( see eq.(30 ) in @xcite or its generalizations ) .",
    "both behaviors are significant from the perspective of string theory because perturbative versus non - perturbative methods would be needed to understand fully the physics in the vicinity of the gravity / antigravity transitions .",
    "namely , when the tension at the transition is large the string would be close to being pointlike , so the stringy corrections would be small and perturbative in the vicinity of the gravity / antigravity transitions ; by contrast when the tension at the transition is small the string would be floppy so stringy corrections could be significant . in the latter case ,",
    "high spin fields @xcite may be an interesting tool to investigate the gravity / antigravity transition in our setting .    from the form of the action in eq.([newflatstring ] )",
    "it is evident that the string action is invariant under reparametrizations of the worldsheet at the classical level .",
    "we will use this symmetry to choose a gauge to perform the classical analysis below .",
    "but eventually we also need to know if this symmetry is valid also at the quantum level .",
    "the generator of this gauge symmetry is the stress tensor , so the stress tensor vanishes as a constraint to impose the gauge invariance . at the classical level",
    "the stress tensor does vanish as part of the solution of the classical equations and constraints ( see below ) . at the quantum level , in ",
    "covariant quantization , the stress tensor does not vanish on all states but only on the gauge invariant physical states . for consistency of covariant quantization",
    "one must verify that the constraints form a set of first class constraints that close under quantum operator products .",
    "in our case the stress tensor derived from ( [ newflatstring ] ) has the form @xmath371sign)@xmath372 , where @xmath373 is the usual worldsheet stress tensor in the flat background @xmath363 , while the sign factor switches signs at the kinks @xmath374 . in the positive ( gravity , sign=+ ) region , we have symbolically the operator products , @xmath375 where the standard cft result on the right hand side is computed exactly for the flat string .",
    "similarly , in the negative ( antigravity , sign=@xmath376 ) region we have , @xmath377 so the algebra is closed like the standard cft locally in the positive and negative regions away from the kinks . there remains analyzing the operator products at the kinks @xmath378 ( worldsheet analogs of the kinks in fig.1 ) .",
    "the operator products involving the sign factor non - trivially introduce delta functions and derivatives of delta functions multiplied by the sign factor or its derivatives that have support only at the kinks . at one contraction ( order @xmath379 effects )",
    "the coefficient of the delta function includes the flat @xmath373 or its derivatives evaluated at the kinks . since @xmath373 or its derivatives are in the list of first class constraints ( virasoro operators ) , this is still a closed algebra of first class constraints all of which vanish on physical states . at two contractions ( order @xmath380 in quantum effects )",
    "there are again some terms that contain @xmath373 or its derivatives , which again are of no concern since these still vanish on physical states . however , there are also additional operators of the form of @xmath381 multiplying products of the sign function , delta function , or its derivatives , all evaluated at the kinks . we have analyzed these complicated distributions and found that they vanish when integrated with @xmath382 ,",
    "so they do not seem to contribute .",
    "similarly we can drop several similar terms due to the properties of the distributions .",
    "the analysis at the kinks becomes harder at higher contractions ( @xmath383 and beyond in quantum effects ) , and we leave this for future analysis to be reported at a later stage .",
    "the main point is that if there are additional constraints that must be imposed at the kinks they will show up in this type of operator product analysis .",
    "so far , we have not found new constraints up to two contractions in the operator products .",
    "thus , the algebra of the operator products is basically the standard algebra of a conformal field theory ( cft ) locally in the positive and negative regions away from the kinks .",
    "the modification of the cft algebra at the kinks with terms that are proportional to virasoro operators does not change the validity of the gauge symmetry at the quantum level , since those terms vanish on physical states anyway .",
    "although we have not yet found other operator modifications of the algebra at the kinks , conceptually it is possible that such terms may arise at higher contractions or in other models that include gravity / antigravity transitions .",
    "when and if such terms appear , they must be included in an enlarged list of constraints that should form a closed algebra under operator products , then this will  define the proper quantum theory .    in this paper",
    "our aim is to first understand the classical theory of a string described by the action in ( [ newflatstring ] ) , so we do not need to be concerned here about the subtleties described in the previous paragraph . in fact the classical analysis that we give below is helpful in further developing the right approach for the quantum theory .",
    "thus , setting aside temporarily the possible stringy corrections , we are at first interested in the classical behavior of strings as they propagate in the union of the gravity / antigravity regions , and later try to figure out the possible additional effects due to interactions at those transitions by using more sophisticated methods , such as string field theory , or others , as outlined in section [ sft ] .      in this section",
    "we will discuss the properties of the model in eq.([newflatstring ] ) .",
    "the main objective is to show that there are no problems due to the negative tension during antigravity from the point of view of fundamental principles , such as unitarity or possible instability due to negative kinetic energy .",
    "the unitarity of this string model was already established in @xcite more generally for any time dependent tension @xmath384 and more general metric , so we will not repeat it here . we will concentrate on the effect of the antigravity period on the propagation of the string and the corresponding signals that observers in gravity may detect . as we will demonstrate , as compared to the complete absence of antigravity , the presence of an antigravity period for a certain amount of time causes only a time delay in the propagation of an open or closed free string of any configuration .",
    "this may seem surprising since , at first thought , one may think that string bits would fly apart under an instability caused by a negative string tension .",
    "in fact , this does not happen because a negative tension is simply an overall sign in the action of a free string , and this does not change the equations of motion and constraints of a free string during antigravity .",
    "we work in the conformal gauge at the classical level .",
    "there is a remaining reparametrization symmetry that permits the further choice of the following time - like gauge@xmath385 where @xmath10 is the total time dependent hamiltonian of the string while @xmath386 is time independent .",
    "this is similar to the massless free field in section ( [ nomass ] ) . in this gauge",
    "the remaining degrees of freedom satisfy the following equations of motion and constraints @xmath15{c}\\left (   \\partial_{\\tau}^{2}-\\partial_{\\sigma}^{2}\\right )   \\vec{x}\\left ( \\tau,\\sigma\\right )   = 0,\\\\ h^{2}=\\left (   \\partial_{\\tau}\\vec{x}\\pm\\partial_{\\sigma}\\vec{x}\\right )   ^{2 } , \\end{array}\\ ] ] to be solved in each time region @xmath387 defined by @xmath388 furthermore , the solutions for @xmath389 and the canonical momenta @xmath390sign@xmath391 should be continuous at the boundaries @xmath392 the method of solution follows the simple model in eq.([method ] ) or the massive field in eq.([mass ] ) .",

    "in the neighborhood of the gravity / antigravity transition , which occurs typically at a gravitational singularity , a proper understanding of the physics would be incomplete without the input of quantum gravity that may possibly contribute large quantum effects .",
    "how should we estimate the effects of quantum gravity ?",
    "we first point out that attempting to use an effective low energy field theory that includes higher powers of curvature , such as those computed from string theory , is the wrong approach .",
    "higher powers of curvature capture approximations to quantum gravity that are valid at momenta much smaller than the planck scale ; those can not be used to investigate the phenomena of interest that are at the planck scale close to the singularity . for investigating the gravity / antigravity transition",
    "more closely , we do not see an alternative to using directly an appropriate theory of quantum gravity that can incorporate the geodesically complete spacetime that includes both gravity and antigravity regions .",
    "hence we first need to define the proper theory of quantum gravity that is consistent with geodesic completeness . as far as we know this notion of quantum gravity was first considered in @xcite .",
    "assuming that quantum string theory is a suitable approach to quantum gravity , we outline here how string field theory may be modified to take into account geodesic completeness and the presence of an antigravity sector , so that it can be used as a proper tool to answer the relevant questions .",
    "open and closed string field theory ( sft ) is a formalism for computing string - string interactions , including those that involve stringy gravitons . as in standard field theory , in principle",
    "the sft formalism is suitable for both perturbative and non - perturbative computations .",
    "technically sft is hard to compute with , but it has the advantage of being a self consistent and conceptually complete definition of quantum gravity and the interactions with matter .",
    "it is therefore crucial to see how antigravity fits in sft and therefore how the pertinent questions involving antigravity can be addressed in a self consistent manner .    in the context of sft , gravitational and other backgrounds in which strings propagate are incorporated through the brst operator @xmath463 that appears in the quadratic part of the action @xcite @xmath464   .",
    "\\label{sftaction}\\ ] ] the complete sft action must also include closed strings , @xmath465 the supersymmetric versions of these may also be considered . here",
    "@xmath466 is the string field , the product @xmath467 describes string joining or splitting , and the brst operator @xmath463 is given by@xmath468 where @xmath469 are the fadeev - popov ghosts , which is a device of covariant quantization , while @xmath470 is the stress tensor for left / right moving strings , associated to any conformal field theory ( cft ) on the worldsheet that is conformally exact at the quantum level .",
    "the gravitational and other backgrounds , including a dynamical tension that flips signs ( i.e. incorporating antigravity ) of the type we discussed in the previous sections , are included in the stress tensor @xmath471 if these backgrounds are not geodesically complete we expect that the sft theory is incomplete since even at the classical level on the worldsheet there would be string solutions that would be incomplete just like particle geodesics that would be incomplete .",
    "thus for a geodesically complete sft we need to make sure that @xmath472 belongs to a geodesically complete worldsheet string model as described in the previous section .",
    "examples of such string models were provided in sections ( [ flat],[2dbh ] ) .",
    "similarly one can construct many more geodesically complete backgrounds by allowing the string tension to change sign at singularities ( and perhaps more generally ) as long as the cft conditions , that amount to @xmath473 are satisfied .",
    "if the interactions in the sft action ( [ sftaction ] ) are neglected we do not expect dramatic effects due to the presence of antigravity since we have seen in the previous section the effect is only a time delay as compared to the complete absence of antigravity ( as in sections [ delayedparticle],[nomass],[flat ] ) . by including the interactions either perturbatively or non - perturbatively we can explore the effects of antigravity in the context of the quantum theory . in the previous sections ,",
    "we have obtained a glimpse of the phenomena that could happen , including particle ( or string ) production ( as in section [ mass ] ) , excitations of various string states ( as in section [ interact ] ) , and more dramatic phenomena that remain to be explored .    from the discussion in the first part of section ( [ flat ] )",
    "one may gather that we are still in the process of addressing some technicalities in the construction of the brst operator @xmath463 for the simple model in that section .",
    "so we are not yet in a position to perform explicit computations , but we hope we have provided an outline of how one may formulate an appropriate theory to address and answer the relevant questions",
    ".    there may be alternative formalisms that could provide answers more easily than sft , and of course those should be explored , but the advantage of sft for being a conceptually complete and self consistent definition of the system , including the presence of antigravity as outlined above , is likely to remain as an important feature of this approach because of the overall perspective that it provides .",
    "we have argued that a fundamental theory that could address the physical phenomena close to gravitational singularities , either in the form of field theory or string theory , is unlikely to be complete without incorporating geodesic completeness .",
    "the weyl symmetric approach to the standard model coupled to gravity in eq.([action ] ) , and the similar treatment of string theory @xcite , generally solves this problem and naturally requires that antigravity regions of spacetime should appear on the other side of gravitational singularities as integral parts of the spacetime described by a fundamental theory .",
    "there are other views that the notion of spacetime may not even exist at the extremes close to singularities .",
    "while acknowledging that there may be other scenarios that are little understood at this time , we believe that our concrete proposal merits further investigation .    while emphasizing that there are nicer weyl gauges , we have shown how gravitational theories and string theories can be formulated in their traditional einstein or string frames to include effects of a weyl symmetry that renders them geodesically complete . a prediction of the weyl symmetry is to naturally include an antigravity region of field space and spacetime that is geodesically connected to the traditional gravity spacetime at gravitational singularities . precisely at the singularities that appear in the einstein or string frames the gravitational constant or string tension flip sign suddenly ( but smoothly in nicer weyl gauges ) . as shown in section ( [ frames ] ) , this sign can be absorbed into a redefinition of the metric in the einstein or string frame , @xmath474 where @xmath475 describes the spacetime in the union of the gravity and antigravity regions .",
    "this definition of the complete spacetime may then be used to perform computations in the geodesically complete theory .",
    "the appearance of negative kinetic energy terms for some degrees of freedom during antigravity was a source of concern .",
    "the arguments presented here show that this was a false alarm .",
    "we argued that unitarity is not an issue either in gravity or antigravity and that negative energy does not imply an instability of the theory as seen by observers in the gravity region ( namely , observers like us , analyzing the universe ) .",
    "we made this point by studying many simple examples and we showed that observers in the gravity sector can deduce the existence and at least some properties of antigravity .",
    "we have thus eliminated the initial concerns regarding unitarity or instability of the complete theory when there is an antigravity sector with negative kinetic energy .",
    "we have also demonstrated that there are very interesting physical phenomena associated with antigravity that remain to be explored concerning fundamental physics at the extremities of spacetime .",
    "these will have applications in cosmology as in @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite and black hole physics as in @xcite@xcite .",
