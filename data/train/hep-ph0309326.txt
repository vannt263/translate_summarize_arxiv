    "the formation of jets is the most prominent feature of perturbative qcd in @xmath0 annihilation into hadrons .",
    "jets can be visualized as large portions of hadronic energy or , equivalently , as a set of hadrons confined to an angular region in the detector . in the past , this qualitative definition was replaced by quantitatively precise schemes to define and measure jets , such as the cone algorithms of the weinberg ",
    "sterman @xcite type or clustering algorithms , e.g. the jade @xcite or the durham scheme ( @xmath1 scheme ) @xcite .",
    "a refinement of the latter one is provided by the cambridge algorithm @xcite .",
    "equipped with a precise jet definition the determination of jet production cross sections and their intrinsic properties is one of the traditional tools to investigate the structure of the strong interaction and to deduce its fundamental parameters . in the past decade , precision measurements , especially in @xmath0 annihilation , have established both the gauge group structure underlying qcd and the running of its coupling constant @xmath2 over a wide range of scales . in a similar way ,",
    "also the quark masses should vary with the scale .    a typical strategy to determine the mass of , say , the bottom - quark at the centre - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy of the collider is to compare the ratio of three - jet production cross sections for heavy and light quarks @xcite . at jet resolution",
    "scales below the mass of the quark , i.e. for gluons emitted by the quark with a relative transverse momentum @xmath1 smaller than the mass , the collinear divergences are regularized by the quark mass . in this region",
    "mass effects are enhanced by large logarithms @xmath3 , increasing the significance of the measurement .",
    "indeed , this leads to a multiscale problem since in this kinematical region also large logarithms @xmath4 appear such that both logarithms need to be resummed simultaneously . a solution to a somewhat similar two - scale problem , namely for the average sub - jet multiplicities in two- and three - jet events in @xmath0 annihilation was given in  @xcite .",
    "we report here on the resummation of such logarithms in the @xmath1-like jet algorithms  @xcite and provide some predictions for heavy quark production .",
    "a preliminary comparison with next - to - leading order calculations of the three - jet rate  @xcite is presented .",
    "a clustering according to the relative transverse momenta has a number of properties that minimize the effect of hadronization corrections and allow an exponentiation of leading ( ll ) and next - to - leading logarithms ( nll )  @xcite stemming from soft and collinear emission of secondary partons .",
    "jet rates in @xmath1 algorithms can be expressed , up to nll accuracy , via integrated splitting functions and sudakov form factors  @xcite . for a better description of the jet properties ,",
    "however , the matching with fixed order calculations is mandatory .",
    "such a matching procedure was first defined for event shapes in  @xcite .",
    "later applications include the matching of fixed - order and resummed expressions for the four - jet rate in @xmath0 annihilation into massless quarks  @xcite .",
    "a similar scheme for the matching of tree - level matrix elements with resummed expressions in the framework of monte carlo event generators for @xmath0 processes was suggested in  @xcite and extended to general collision types in  @xcite .",
    "we shall recall here the results obtained in  @xcite for heavy quark production in @xmath0 annihilation . in the quasi - collinear limit",
    "@xcite , the squared amplitude at tree - level fulfils a factorization formula , where the splitting functions @xmath5 for the branching processes @xmath6 , with at least one of the partons being a heavy quark , are given by @xmath7~ , \\nnb \\\\",

    "as expected , these splitting functions match the massless splitting functions in the limit @xmath10 for @xmath9 fixed .",

    "the jet rates add up to one at nll accuracy .",
    "this statement is obviously realized in the result above order by order in @xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding massless result  @xcite is obtained from eqs .",

    "( [ coef1 ] ) and  ( [ coef2 ] ) are valid only for @xmath27 and therefore @xmath10 does not reproduce the correct limit , which has to be smooth as given by eq.([jetrates ] ) .",
    "let us also mention that for @xmath28 there is a strong cancellation of leading logarithms and therefore subleading effects become more pronounced .",
    "an approximate way of including mass effects in massless calculations , that is sometimes used , is the `` dead cone ''  @xcite approximation .",
    "the dead cone relies on the observation that , at leading logarithmic order , there is no radiation of soft and collinear gluons off heavy quarks .",
    "this effect can be easily understood from the splitting function @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pqq ] ) . for @xmath30",

    "the massless splitting function has been used , which is integrated with the additional constraint @xmath32 .",
    "we also compare our results with this approximation .",
    "the impact of mass effects can be highlighted by two examples , namely by the effect of the bottom quark mass in @xmath0 annihilation at the @xmath33-pole , and by the effect of the top quark mass at a potential linear collider operating in the tev region .    with @xmath34 gev , @xmath35 gev , and @xmath36 , the effect of the @xmath37-mass at the @xmath33-pole on the two- and three - jet rates",
    "is depicted in fig .",
    "[ bb91 ] ( left ) .",
    "the result obtained in the dead cone approximation is shown in fig .",
    "[ bb91 ] ( right ) .",
    "clearly , by using the full massive splitting function , the onset of mass effects in the jet rates is not abrupt as in the dead cone case and becomes visible much earlier .",
    "already at the rather modest value of the jet resolution parameters of @xmath38 , the two - jet rate , including mass effects , is enhanced by roughly @xmath39 with respect to the massless case , whereas the three - jet rate is decreased by roughly @xmath40 . for even smaller jet resolution parameters , the two - jet rate experiences an increasing enhancement , whereas the massive three - jet rate starts being larger than the massless one at values of the jet resolution parameters of the order of @xmath41 .",
    "the curves have been obtained by numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ jetrates ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in order to obtain physical result the branching probabilities have been set to one whenever they exceed one or to zero whenever they become negative .    while in the case of bottom quarks at lep1 energies the overall effect of the quark mass is at the few - per - cent level , this effect becomes tremendous for top quarks at the linear collider ( fig .",
    "[ t1 ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ b91 ] , leading order ( lo ) and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) predictions for three - jet rates are compared with the nll result showed in the previous plots .",
    "fixed order predictions for @xmath37-quark production clearly fail at very low values of @xmath42 , by giving unphysical values for the jet rate , while the nll predictions keep physical and reveal the correct shape .",
    "the latter is an indication of the necessity for performing such kind of resummations .",
    "fixed order predictions work well for top production at the linear collider , a consequence of the strong cancellation of leading logarithmic corrections , and are fully compatible with our nll result .",
    "sudakov form factors involving heavy quarks have been employed to estimate the size of mass effects in jet rates in @xmath0 annihilation into hadrons .",
    "these effects are sizeable and therefore observable in the experimentally relevant region .",
    "a preliminary comparison with fixed order results have been presented , and showed good agreement .",
