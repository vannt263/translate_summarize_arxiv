    "the consensus in these models is a rapid evolution in the density of massive haloes at @xmath6 that should be observationally evident in galaxy luminosity and mass functions .    until recently , observations of the highest - redshift galaxies were limited to a small number of massive individual galaxies and quasars at @xmath7 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the recent advent of high - redshift surveys including the cosmic assembly near - infrared deep extragalactic survey ( candels ; @xcite ) and the spitzer large area survey with hyper - suprime - cam ( splash ; capak et al . in prep . ) now allows us to probe the galaxy luminosity and mass functions , and by implication the corresponding halo mass function , across a range of masses from @xmath8 . in particular , splash has the broad sky coverage required to measure the number density of relatively rare , massive galaxies , while candels is a deeper survey over a smaller area , more suited to finding lower - mass galaxies .",
    "a range of work has estimated halo masses for @xmath6 galaxies and pointed out the tension between the expected evolution of the halo mass function and galaxy luminosity and mass function ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . here",
    "we assemble this previous work and update it with more recent measurements of the galaxy luminosity function , our knowledge of the @xmath6 galaxy population , and stellar synthesis models .",
    "we begin by showing that the rapid evolution of the high - mass end of the halo mass function at @xmath1 allows the rare , most luminous and/or massive galaxies in large surveys to provide stringent constraints on galaxy evolution in the hierarchical merging paradigm .",
    "the most straightforward prediction comes from the mass and number density of the most massive halos that have formed as a function of redshift .",
    "furthermore , the consensus @xmath0cdm model combined with our understanding of galaxy evolution also predicts a sharp drop in the number density of high - luminosity galaxies at fixed @xmath9 and a rapid decline in the luminosity of massive galaxies at fixed number density towards high redshift .",

    "using these tests , in   [ subsec : lum ] , we show that high - luminosity galaxies do not exhibit the rapid evolution in number density at fixed @xmath9 expected from hierarchical merging .",

    "the timespan of 0.9 gyr over this redshift range means that we likely observe these galaxies within at most a few dynamical times of their initial assembly .",
    "since galaxies are expected to form after their halos assemble , the number density of massive systems and its redshift evolution can provide a good probe of the initial formation of the their dark matter halos .",
    "the broad redshift range over a relatively small amount of time allows for more precise cosmic epoch measurements than are easily obtainable at lower redshift .    however , at these high redshifts there are a limited number of tools available for estimating halo masses .",
    "the most robust are galaxy clustering based methods that infer the halo masses from the spatial distribution of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "clustering methods have the advantage of not requiring assumptions about the physical properties of the galaxies , but must assume a model for the dark matter from simulations .",

    "a key feature of a luminosity or mass function , such as the knee of the luminosity function , to a feature halo mass function , then matches the galaxy density and the dark matter halo density to derive halo masses .",
    "the main shortcoming of this method is that it will reproduce the halo mass function by definition and is sensitive to the point at which the two functions are tied together .",
    "finally , one can assume a luminosity or stellar mass to dark matter mass ratio measured at lower redshifts where better estimators of dark matter are available @xcite .",
    "in the past , only a handful of @xmath6 , galaxies were known , far too few to estimate the corresponding halo mass function using any of these methods . however , recent infrared observations by the candels collaboration @xcite and the spitzer large area survey with hyper - suprime - cam ( splash ; @xcite ) provide a much larger sample of high - redshift galaxies with stellar mass estimates and can now be used to estimate the halo mass function at @xmath2 .",

    "specifically , we find that observational halo mass function estimates correspond to a higher number density of massive halos than should have been able to form through the rapid collapse and evolution of rare , highly - overdense regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : z6data ] ) .",
    "one possible explanation is that the @xmath17 ratio in massive galaxies sharply decreases at @xmath6 , leading to overestimated halo masses for high - redshift galaxies .",
    "if so , we might hope that this rapid evolution should be evident from other measured properties of the galaxy population . in ",
    "[ subsec : normal ] , we will use scaling relations to probe this possibility , instead finding that this rapid evolution is not observed .",
    "we have shown that there appears to be a sharp conflict between the halo mass function inferred from observations at @xmath1 and the theoretical production of halos in the early universe .",
    "we term this the _ impossibly early _ galaxy problem .",
    "however , many of these estimates critically depend on galaxy spectral energy distribution templates and scaling relations derived at lower redshift . as a result",
    ", the possibility that these assumptions have broken down by @xmath1 is a major concern ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and such a breakdown would provide an easy solution to the impossibly early galaxy problem .",
    "lower - redshift galaxies are much more robustly understood , and follow several trends and scaling relations , both at fixed redshift and in their redshift evolution .",
    "a good test of whether high - redshift galaxies are truly similar to low - redshift galaxies , as has been strongly assumed , is to check whether they lie on the high - redshift extrapolation of this behavior .",
    "as summarized below , we indeed find that early , high - redshift galaxies appear to be ` normal ' , including the most massive early galaxies that provide the sharpest disagreement with theoretical halo production .    over the past few decades , there have been a series of observational results indicating that many processes in the most massive and luminous galaxies , including star formation @xcite and quasar accretion @xcite , occur earlier than in less massive galaxies .",
    "the early evolution of star forming galaxies is further supported by the existence of a population of massive , passive galaxies at @xmath18 @xcite , which must have been massive star - forming galaxies at high redshift similar to those reported by splash and candels @xcite .",
    "furthermore , feii / mgii ratios in high - redshift quasars @xcite and ages derived from template fitting @xcite suggest that early , massive galaxies indeed form their stars very rapidly .",
    "in contrast , @xmath0cdm theory requires that more massive haloes generally assemble later than less massive ones .",
    "so , reconciling the theory and observations requires that more massive galaxies must evolve far more rapidly than less massive ones . because the dynamical time increases with mass",
    ", this rapid evolution would require a change in the baryonic processes that dominate star formation at lower redshifts .",
    "such a model would predict that the redshift @xmath1 universe is a period of rapid transition between the initial assembly of massive halos and the quick growth of their stellar populations .      to date ,",
    "splash and candels find no apparent deviation from properties derived at lower redshift .",
    "instead , they find that the trend towards more and more massive galaxies evolving earlier continues out to @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , at @xmath19 it has been shown that star - forming galaxies lie on a `` main sequence '' , with a tight correlation between the existing stellar mass and their star - formation rate ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "an analysis of over two dozen studies of star - forming galaxies using different techniques for selection , for measuring stellar mass , and for measuring star formation rate shows strong agreement in both slope and redshift evolution @xcite .",
    "early , high - redshift galaxies lie on the extrapolation of this main sequence to @xmath20 .",
    "the star - forming main sequence is well - measured for lower - mass objects at @xmath21 , with agreement between splash @xcite and candels @xcite . where stellar masses are available , the most massive early galaxies lie directly on the high - mass extrapolation of this main sequence .",
    "because the stellar mass and star formation rates are measured using different wavelengths , systematic errors from incorrect template fitting would produce incorrect inferred quantities in different ways , and likely produce a population inconsistent with the main sequence .",
    "similarly , arbitrary deblending problems would produce outliers lying somewhere arbitrary , and thus likely off this main sequence .",
    "the redshift evolution of the star - forming main sequence is also well understood at @xmath19 , and the observed @xmath22 star - forming main sequence has the properties produced by extrapolating that time - dependence . the increase in mass towards high redshift of the @xmath23 most massive star - forming galaxies",
    "( one component of what has been termed the `` downsizing '' problem ) is also well measured @xcite , and the most massive star - forming galaxies at @xmath24 lie on the extrapolation of the best - fit time - dependence at @xmath19 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : speagle2014 ] ) .    at some point",
    "stellar templates derived from low redshift will cease to be valid , but this has yet to be observed .",
    "it might be expected that this occurs only when the physics of star formation have changed , perhaps due to very low metallicities producing a very top - heavy imf and even population iii stars .",
    "if so , templates may continue to be valid well above @xmath2 . at a minimum",
    ", it seems clear that they have not become catastrophically incorrect in the redshift range where impossibly early galaxies have been measured .      a final test of consistency for early",
    ", massive star - forming galaxies comes from quasar accretion .",
    "it is believed that there is coevolution between a galaxy and its central supermassive black hole .",
    "quasar accretion exhibits similar behavior to star - forming galaxies in the sense that there is `` main sequence''-like behavior @xcite with the most luminous quasars becoming more luminous and having larger black hole masses towards higher redshift .",
    "indeed , there has historically been an `` impossibly early black hole '' problem similar to the impossibly early galaxies presented in this work ( @xcite ; cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , although as we discuss in this work the star formation problem appears to be more difficult to solve .",
    "one parameterization of the similarity between the redshift evolution of quasars and star - forming galaxies is to note that the ratio of @xmath25 for most massive star - forming galaxies to @xmath26 for the most massive quasars is observed to be approximately 30:1 at all fixed redshifts ( as shown by @xcite from a literature compilation ) .",
    "the @xmath27 galaxies at @xmath24 in splash have a similar ratio with early , massive quasars such as the @xmath28 quasar recently reported at @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "because virial black hole mass estimates have very different systematic uncertainties than stellar mass estimates , this ratio continuing to hold is additional evidence that the properties inferred for impossibly early galaxies are likely reasonable .    certainly at some sufficiently high redshift , these various scaling relations and correlations should break down , but again this has yet to be observed .",
    "the key point is that the observed high - redshift population of star - forming galaxies follows the expected redshift evolution determined observationally from many lower - redshift surveys .",
    "even the most massive , highest - redshift objects are found and analyzed using the same standard techniques that have been verified to be successful at lower redshift , and are remarkable solely because of the discrepancy between observation and @xmath0cdm , not because of the data .",
    "uv luminosity functions are one of the cheapest and most robust observations to obtain at high redshift , and can be converted to halo masses by assuming a halo mass - to - light ratio .",
    "indeed , most of the high - redshift data shown in fig . [",
    "fig : z6data ] and all of those at @xmath7 are derived from monochromatic uv luminosity functions @xcite , the only observations available .",
    "the main advantage of this technique over mass functions is that it places most of the potentially large uncertainty into the halo mass - to - light ratio , which can be parameterized in a single model where it can be analyzed more clearly .",
    "in contrast , mass functions place much of the uncertainty in the details of the diverse set of spectral energy distribution models fit to each individual galaxy where they can be difficult to understand @xcite .    in addition to uncertainty in the correspondance between halo mass and uv luminosity , comparing observation with theory also requires matching observations of galaxies in the midst of star formation with theoretical predictions about the time at which their halo was formed .",
    "after all , galaxies likely do not emerge fully - formed at the moment a halo virializes ; the dark matter merely has to collapse gravitationally , while baryons get a later start at small masses ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and must clump and cool in order to form stars . if this process typically takes , e.g. , 300 myr for every galaxy due to dynamical considerations , then a sharp rise in the halo mass function as predicted from redshift 8.0 to 4.0 would lead to a sharp rise in the uv luminosity function for corresponding galaxies from redshift 6.0 to 3.4 . more generally , in a matter - dominated universe , @xmath30 .",
    "thus , delays between halo ( smaller @xmath31 ) and galaxy formation ( larger @xmath31 ) lead to the uv luminosity function evolving equally rapidly with time but _ over a smaller range in redshift _ , producing a more noticeable effect observationally ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zt ] ) .",
    "these two uncertainties  how to match star - forming galaxy uv luminosities to halo formation in both mass and time  both lie at the heart of the key open questions concerning early galactic evolution .",
    "determining these two parameters requires a better understanding of several key aspects of galactic evolution .",
    "the time delay between assembly and later evolution depends upon the relationship between halo formation and the evolution of the galaxies that evolve inside those halos . constraining the luminosity to halo mass ratio involves constraining the high - redshift initial mass function , dust content , and other processes involved in the formation of the first large stellar populations made by galaxies .",
    "because there is very little degeneracy between shifts in mass and time , if both the uv luminosity function and halo mass function are well measured independently , it should be possible to determine both shifts .",
    "indeed , such a determination is the core idea behind abundance matching , using a combination of theoretical predictions and measurements of number density to ` match ' halos with galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite . what we find , however , is that this matching process seems to fail at high redshift . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : z6data ] , matching halos with galaxies would require that galaxies live in halos so small as to be unphysical , in extreme cases less than a factor of three higher than stellar masses .",
    "further , the sharp high - mass evolution in the halo mass function has no observed counterpart in luminosity functions , either at high redshift or over a similar period of time at lower redshift .      out to @xmath32 ,",
    "several studies @xcite ) are consistent with a nearly constant halo mass - to - light ratio .",
    "however , this ratio must evolve at higher redshifts to reconcile the uv luminosity function with hierarchical merging ( fig . [",
    "fig : z6data ] ) .",
    "there are two ways this might occur : halos might be more efficient at producing stars than previously believed or stars might produce more uv light per unit stellar mass than at lower redshift .    in order to determine the best explanation , consider the size of the change in the halo mass to luminosity ratio that would be required to reconcile observation with theory . at a fixed monochromatic luminosity of , for example , @xmath33 , there is a 1.5 dex decrease in number density from @xmath15 to @xmath34 @xcite . at @xmath35",
    ", clustering analysis shows that this corresponds to a halo mass of @xmath36 @xcite . in the most ( very likely overly ) optimistic scenario ,",
    "in which stars instantly come into existence so that there is no time delay between halo and galaxy formation , the observed number density for @xmath33 galaxies at @xmath37 corresponds to the number density of @xmath38 halos .",
    "thus , a sharp evolution of 0.8 dex in @xmath39 would be required from @xmath13 to @xmath34 .",
    "we consider in the remainder of this section whether this evolution is plausible .",
    "evolution in the halo mass to light ratio could be considered to be dominated by four effects :    1 .",
    "* stellar evolution : * in a typical stellar population , the luminosity is dominated by massive stars , but the stellar mass ( which is used to estimate the halo mass ) is dominated by low - mass stars . as a result , the mass to light ratio is higher for older stellar populations . assuming galaxies at @xmath37 have younger stellar populations than @xmath13 , this effect acts in the direction of reconciling observation with theory .",
    "increasing metallicity associated with maturing stellar populations enhances this effect .",
    "* changing imf : * if the initial mass function ( imf ) is top - heavy at high redshift , as expected for pop .",
    "iii stars , this would again act to decrease the mass to light ratio . however , the imf is expected to be similar at all @xmath40 based upon seemingly analagous low - redshift systems @xcite , and therefore to have no impact on impossibly early galaxies (   [ subsubsec : imf ] ) .",
    "3 .   * evolving dust corrections : * very few galaxies with photometric @xmath41 are selected as highly dusty ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , so a strong reduction in extinction from current models is not plausible .",
    "however , if they were dusty , an increase in extinction would increase the halo mass to monochromatic uv luminosity ratio , making the halos containing early galaxies even more massive than currently measured .",
    "* merging and time delays : * clustering and merging results in the addition of both halo mass and stellar mass to galaxies , as well as additional gas that will eventually form stars",
    ". a merger of two large objects with the same mass - to - light ratio will yield a galaxy with that same ratio .",
    "however , more gradual accretion of both dark matter and gas capable of forming stars will produce an immediate increase in halo mass but delayed increase in stellar mass , making the typical halo mass - to - light ratio larger at @xmath37 than at @xmath13 .",
    "this would act in the direction of making the problem worse , because galaxies at the same luminosity would now reside in even more massive halos , which have a lower number density and later virialization time .",
    "for example , @xcite find that a @xmath42 galaxy at @xmath43 should correspond to a @xmath44 halo , whereas we have assumed based upon lower - redshift measurements that its halo was below @xmath45 .    the best - case realistic scenario for producing early , luminous galaxies , then , is one in which an isolated stellar population is aging as rapidly as possible ( # 1 ) and there is no evolution in dust ( # 3 ) or time delay between infall and star formation ( # 4 ) .",
    "we model the halo mass to light ratio ( fig .",
    "[ fig : realistic]a ) from an initial stellar population that formed in one rapid burst , perhaps as early as @xmath46 @xcite , followed by evolution along the star - forming main sequence until observed at @xmath47 .",
    "if the time dependence of the star - forming main sequence at @xmath7 can be extrapolated from the best - fit evolution at @xmath48 ( as determined by , e.g. , @xcite ) , it will be nearly constant at higher redshifts because of the short gap in elapsed time . thus , sfr @xmath49 , with the stellar age increasing from an initial small value to asymptotically approach 50 - 150 myr .",
    "depending upon redshift .",
    "this is insufficient to reconcile observation with theory ( fig .",
    "[ fig : realistic]b ) .",
    "the most likely scenarios are even more difficult to reconcile with theory .",
    "we model the evolution of the halo mass to light ratio ( fig .",
    "[ fig : morerealistic]a ) as above , but further include a 300 myr delay ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) between merging and resulting star formation motivated by dynamical timescales , so that the luminosity function at time @xmath31 is used to predict the halo mass function at @xmath50 myr . the halo mass functions in fig .",
    "[ fig : morerealistic]b are colored to match the redshift of the corresponding luminosity function , so that the yellow @xmath51 ( @xmath52 gyr ) observationally - derived halo masses are matched with a yellow @xmath53 ( @xmath54 gyr ) halo mass function .",
    "we additionally include dust evolution as in @xcite from @xmath37 to @xmath13 .",
    "this has no effect on halo mass estimates derived from clustering and from template fitting that already includes extinction , but will alter halo masses estimated from uv luminosities . for the purposes of this model , we take the @xmath13 abundance matching - derived halo mass to uv luminosity ratios as correct , then apply an additional correction at higher redshift to account for evolution in the mean extinction at that luminosity between that redshift and @xmath13 . the resulting comparison between observation and theory ( fig .",
    "[ fig : morerealistic]b ) is likely our best model given current data , and produces a larger disagreement than the models previously discussed .",
    "perhaps the most realistic idea along these lines would be to create all of the stars directly at @xmath55 , in which case the age - zero stellar population decreases the halo mass - to - light ratio sufficiently to produce a match between the @xmath55 halo mass and uv luminosity function .",
    "however , this would require these galaxies by @xmath13 to have stellar populations nearly 1 gyr old ( and thus appear passive ) , and there should be a significant population of high - redshift starbursting galaxies . instead ,",
    "massive galaxies at these redshifts are almost exclusively star - forming @xcite , typically with @xmath56 myr old stellar populations .",
    "furthermore , there is an apparent drop in the density of extreme starburst galaxies towards higher redshift @xcite , contradicting the required evolution .    even discarding these apparently contradictory observations ,",
    "this sharp shift is not quite enough to reconcile observed luminosities with halo mass functions because these stellar populations must then age .",
    "it is possible in this unphysical model to drive the inferred stellar masses low enough to avoid a problem directly at the redshift when all of the star formation is assumed to take place ( @xmath37 in this example ) , but it will reappear a short time later and is as sharp of a conflict as before by @xmath57 .    another approach is to allow an inconsistency between halo masses and inferred baryon masses in order to match halo mass with light .",
    "@xcite used mass - to - light ratios to determine @xmath25 and abundance matching to determine @xmath58 from candels , which requires that @xmath59 appears to evolve from @xmath60 at @xmath61 to @xmath62 by @xmath35 , similar to the overall ratio of 70:1 by low redshift @xcite . in the absence of exotic high - energy physics",
    ", dark matter would collapse at least as early as baryons .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to explain how this ratio can increase over time",
    ".    however , a stellar population aging due to evolution along the star - forming main sequence provides an alternative explanation .",
    "consider a low - metallicity galaxy beginning with a rapid starburst at @xmath63 followed by main sequence star formation .",
    "as the galaxy grows , the average age of the stellar population increases as well , and @xmath64 increases from @xmath37 to @xmath13 . using the @xmath13 value of @xmath64 at all redshifts will correctly estimate @xmath25 at @xmath13 , but overestimate @xmath25 by a factor of 23 at @xmath65 .",
    "assuming that @xmath66 remains constant , correcting the stellar masses would produce @xmath67 at @xmath37 .",
    "thus , a reasonable evolution in the age of stellar populations could reconcile abundance matching with our expectation of constant @xmath59 and @xmath66 if the problems with relative density and assembly time of the halos are ignored .      are there other ways to rapidly change the halo mass to uv luminosity ratio in order to explain the observed mismatch ?",
    "one possibility is to allow for rapid evolution in the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the imf is expected to be substantially the same across cosmic time , even at @xmath68 , similar to what is seen in the lowest - metallicity stellar populations in nearby dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , a much top - heavier imf would either require a new understanding of early star formation or even the possibility that at @xmath57 , there remain residual massive stars from early stellar populations that formed at even lower - metallicities .",
    "because massive main sequence stars have very short lifetimes , this is also unlikely .",
    "the other possibility is that the halo mass to stellar mass ratio might have evolved .",
    "the standard ratio comes from a combination of expecting that 10% of baryons have condensed into stars @xcite and that there is a 6:1 dark matter to baryonic matter ratio @xcite . to change",
    "this ratio by 0.8 dex would either require a complete absence of dark matter at @xmath37 or that nearly 100% of baryons end up in stars at high redshift , both of which would likely require new physics that alters halo mass functions as well .    in conclusion , a possible solution for the disagreement between hierarchical merging and observation is a change in our theory of early star formation , so that we can not easily convert between observed luminosities and halo mass . such a solution would be intriguing in its own right , with implications discussed further in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "abundance matching compels agreement between observation and theory , even though it often comes at the expense of having a strong physical motivation for such a model .",
    "as a result , it can be difficult to understand exactly what it means for abundance matching to have succeeded or failed .",
    "since any pair of continuous functions can be matched in a way that is empirically correct at that redshift , in some sense abundance matching will always be successful , and it is difficult to select only the physically meaningful matches from a technique that includes no underlying physics .",
    "perhaps , then , abundance matching should really be thought of as an extension of the physical model that produces a halo mass function .",
    "combining that model with observations produces additional constraints that essentially become part of the theory , and must be predicted for that theory to be complete .",
    "for example , in this work we have shown that @xmath0cdm requires rapid , major changes in the properties of star - forming galaxies between @xmath13 and @xmath37 .",
    "a logical conclusion is that either a mechanism for those changes must be incorporated into @xmath0cdm or the model must be rejected .",
    "as shown earlier in this section , producing such a mechanism appears difficult , but there is also a large space of possible models that could be developed .",
    "one of the reasons for that large parameter space is that the galaxy luminosity function is a degenerate combination of many different properties .",
    "this is why we can conclude that @xmath0cdm requires a sharp break in typical galactic properties between @xmath13 and @xmath37 , but can not specify precisely which properties must change rapidly .",
    "many parameters , including the initial mass function , stellar population age , star formation efficiency , extinction and differential clustering between baryons and dark matter combine to produce this discontinuous behavior . as a result , it is possible to pick nearly any subset of these parameters and abundance match in a way that avoids rapid evolution , but always at the cost of sharp changes in some of the others .",
    "for example , @xcite report that the star formation efficiency is sharply variable as a function of both mass and redshift , and @xcite instead express it as an increasing baryon fraction ( see also   [ subsec : asp ] ) .",
    "@xcite choose to report an overall halo mass - to - light ratio , allowing that to vary sharply with both mass and redshift .",
    "in an alternative approach , @xcite match observation with theory in order to make prediction at @xmath69 by removing the continuity requirement , so that galaxies have no consistent history , allowing mass to be both added and subtracted in any quantities necessary to match halo mass functions at each redshift .    in this work , galactic evolution",
    "is expressed with respect to redshift , but because observations at different redshifts are also viewing different ranges in both stellar and ( presumably ) halo mass , we note that in many studies this has instead been expressed with respect to a combination of both mass and redshift .",
    "similarly , where necessary we compare different quantities by assuming that galactic scaling ratios determined at lower redshift continue to hold , even though sharp changes in those relations might also be consistent with all existing observations .",
    "ultimately , the proper way to express this effect depends upon its cause , and as we have shown , the most likely astrophysical effects seem incapable of producing such rapid evolution given our current understanding .",
    "having considered the extent to which observations of high - redshift galaxies might allow multiple interpretations , it is important to do the same for our theoretical understanding of hierarchical merging . although the baryonic physics involved in star formation is quite complex and there are multiple definitions of halo mass used in describing the results of simulations , there is broad consensus on how dark matter behaves and on the number density and size of the massive halos that they form .",
    "explaining an observed number density of galaxies in terms of the density of formed halos depends upon three parameters : ( 1 ) the fraction of halos containing a galaxy , or halo occupation rate which is measured to be @xmath7040% at @xmath71 @xcite ; ( 2 ) the fraction of baryons converted into stars , which can be parameterized and is 10% at low redshift @xcite ; and ( 3 ) the amount of time required after virialization for those stars to have formed which will translate into a halo - mass to light ratio and is parameterized by stellar population models .",
    "we display in table 1 various combinations of these parameters could produce the observed number density of @xmath72 for @xmath73 galaxies at @xmath74 .",
    ".various combinations of parameters producing the observed number density of @xmath75 galaxies at @xmath74 , as described in ",
    "[ sec : models ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : combos ]    we find that each of these combinations requires implausible physics , such as 100% of baryons being turned into stars instantly upon halo virialization or 10% of baryons forming stars over 1 gyr before the dark matter halo virializes , or contradicts other observational results .",
    "for example , several combinations require halo masses below @xmath45 .",
    "however , at @xmath76 , @xcite used clustering measurements in cfhtls to find that galaxies at 25.5 mag are found in halos of @xmath77 .",
    "a similar ratio would yield @xmath78 for massive galaxies at @xmath57 .",
    "@xcite use candels observations to argue that the dark matter to baryon ratio decreases towards higher redshift , so that the halo mass to stellar mass ratio is 50:1 at @xmath57 and 40:1 at @xmath79",
    ". this would correspond to @xmath80 .    in summary ,",
    "solutions that give a plausible halo occupation fraction require an implausibly short timescale for star formation , a much higher fraction of baryons to be converted into stars than the 10% in current models , or both .",
    "any solution with a standard ratio between the halo mass and stellar mass of between 50:1 and 100:1 ( @xmath81 ) requires most of the star formation to occur well in advance of initial collapse and virialization .",
    "extensive effort has been put into studying the formation of massive galaxies and their dark matter halos through numerical simulations . the vast difference in both scale and dominant physical processes between hierarchical merging and star formation means that simulations can not investigate both processes directly , but rather use semi - analytical prescriptions for connecting the properties of massive galaxies to their halos .",
    "these prescriptions attempt to model baryonic physics on a very macroscopic level and are drawn from lower - redshift relationships observed between galaxies and their host halos . however , extrapolating these relationships often leads to unphysical results : the millennium simulation @xcite can produce @xmath82 galaxies at @xmath57 , but they live in dark matter halos with @xmath83 .",
    "this is a very small halo mass to stellar mass ratio on several fronts : theoretically , it would require the baryons to cluster in advance of much of the dark matter , as well as very nearly all baryons to have ended up in stars by @xmath57 .",
    "observationally , it would be in conflict with the @xcite and @xcite halo mass to stellar mass ratios discussed in the previous section .",
    "the illustris simulation @xcite picks a set of baryonic relationships that avoids these unphysical extrapolations , resulting in a stellar mass function and luminosity function that look similar to the halo mass function . as a result ,",
    "the simulated number densities of massive galaxies are consistent with observation out to @xmath84 at @xmath85 , but very few galaxies are produced with @xmath86 , disagreeing with the observed number densities at that mass and redshift .",
    "the conclusion from these simulations is that there is broad consensus on the halo mass function , but considerable freedom in matching those halo masses to galactic properties .",
    "even given that freedom , matching observations would require that either stellar masses are vastly overestimated or there is a sharp disconnect between the baryons in massive galaxies and their dark matter halos .",
    "specifically , simulations are consistent with typical galaxies at these redshifts , but can not produce the earliest , most massive galaxies seen at @xmath41 with the introduction of reasonable physics .",
    "rather , then , understanding these galaxies appears to require additional physics not yet included in these simulations , whether baryonic physics relating to star formation or high - energy physics altering the timing of massive halo formation .",
    "we have shown that recent observations of high - redshift galaxies are inconsistent with current theoretical models of galactic assembly . as a general principle , when theory and observation disagree , it is historically best to believe the observational result . however , in this case the observations also rely on untested theoretical assumptions about stellar evolution .",
    "thus , something is wrong , but what ? we can divide the possible flaws and explanations into three possible categories :    1 .   *",
    "failed template fitting or redshift determination * : if the measurements are wrong , it is most likely not in the redshifts ( as spectroscopic redshifts exist for many , albeit less massive galaxies at @xmath87 ) but rather in the assumption that templates derived from lower - redshift galaxies can be used at @xmath57 .",
    "this implies that the halo mass to monochromatic luminosity ratio changes sharply above @xmath15 . as discussed in ",
    "[ subsec : mlevolve ] , the most likely explanation for this evolution would be a sharply top - heavier imf at higher redshifts .",
    "this can potentially be tested in the near future using supernova rates , and certainly following the launch of jwst .",
    "+ later spectroscopy confirmed that low - redshift templates yielded correct results for inferred quantities such as stellar mass out to @xmath88 .",
    "if this breaks down by @xmath24 , it would mean that purely photometric surveys are now insufficient , as new models must be developed and observationally tested by jwst .",
    "it is inevitable that at some point astronomers must encounter this problem , but would be unpleasant to discover that it happens at a lower redshift than currently believed .",
    "* new clustering physics * : another possibility is that halos indeed collapse earlier than allowed by current models , something that would simultaneously solve the high - redshift massive quasar problem as well .",
    "current collapse times are derived from gravity acting on perturbations that can be confirmed using cosmic microwave background measurements , and therefore a much more rapid collapse of the halos would require the introduction of new high - energy physics .",
    "possible solutions here might then provide exciting new constraints on the nature of dark energy or dark matter .",
    "it should be noted that many dark matter models under current consideration are warm dark matter , which would suppress the @xmath24 halo mass function rather than enhance it @xcite .",
    "dark energy with @xmath5 could enhance early structure formation , although cosmic microwave background observations @xcite create considerable tension with the @xmath89 required to solve this problem @xcite 3 .",
    "* early star formation * : a baryonic solution is instead to allow main sequence star formation much earlier than the initial collapse of halos .",
    "such ideas would need to evade difficult constraints from both low - redshift observations , as well as solve the problem of cooling to form small stars at low metallicities .",
    "we further note that if initial stars form in small clumps rather than in fully - formed protogalaxies , the `` clumpyness factor '' in reionization @xcite will be much higher than expected , resulting in far more rapid reionization from star formation alone than currently expected .",
    "if so , this will be evident in infrared background fluctuation measurements .",
    "all three answers carry major consequences for both our current understanding of the initial stages of galactic formation and our future plans for studying high - redshift galaxies .",
    "so , better observations are needed .",
    "there is considerable hope that followup observations will help to determine whether the first of these three explanations is the right one .    rather than speculate as to",
    "which explanation is best , we instead stress that the high - mass objects coming out of high - redshift surveys are now critically important .",
    "future surveys should concentrate on finding and characterizing these objects in sufficient numbers to constrain how these galaxies and their halos co - evolve . since the earliest , most massive galaxies are rare , wide area surveys on the @xmath90 degree scale will be needed .",
    "these objects are no longer merely an extra point or two in the last panel of a figure , but rather pose a key problem at the heart of high - redshift extragalactic astronomy , and need to be given corresponding attention",
