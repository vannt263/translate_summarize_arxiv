    "mimo systems implemented via _ distributed antennas _ , connected via a wireless or wired backbone , have been recently advocated as a viable solution to provide multiplexing , array and micro- or macro - diversity gains in infrastructure or mesh/ ad hoc networks ( see , e.g. , @xcite - katz and references therein ) . in such systems with non - colocated antennas , the main challenge in realizing the full gains of mimo systems is the efficient use of the channel resources needed to coordinate the participating antennas at the transmit and/ or receive sides into effective multi - antenna arrays .",
    "these channel resources can be either _ in - band , _ that is , in the same time and frequency band of the main end - to - end transmission @xcite @xcite , or _ out - of - band _ , i.e. , over orthogonal channels , possibly realized via wired connections or different wireless radio interfaces @xcite @xcite .",
    "moreover , the feasibility of different transmission schemes depends on the amount of information that the available transceivers have regarding the encoding functions shared by the sources and destinations of the transmitted data .",
    "for example , decode - and - forward - type schemes require full knowledge of the codebooks used to encode the received data , while compress - and - forward or amplify - and - forward strategies do not have this requirement .",
    "basic @xmath1 distributed mimo systems with full codebook information and with in - band signalling between transmit antennas , at one end , and receive antennas , at the other , were considered in @xcite and host for half and full - duplex transceivers , respectively .",
    "reference sanderovich - new studies a general mimo system with infinite - capacity out - of - band links connecting the transmit - side antennas and finite - capacity links at the receive side , where antennas are assumed to be either codebook - unaware ( i.e. , _ oblivious _ ) or informed .",
    "another line of work that is of interest here deals with distributed - antenna transmitters or receivers in a cellular scenario in the presence of non - ideal out - of - band links connecting the cooperating ( transmit or receive ) antennas ( base stations ) , which can be either oblivious or not @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the scenario depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] in which a single source @xmath2 has data to communicate to a remote destination @xmath3 communication takes place via a distributed @xmath4  mimo system constructed by connecting the source to the @xmath5 transmitting antennas through ( equal ) finite - capacity links and likewise the @xmath5 receiving antennas to the destination .",
    "the finite - capacity links are assumed to be orthogonal among themselves and out - of - band .",
    "this is the case when the source and destination are connected to the transmitters and receivers , respectively , via a wired backbone or via orthogonal wireless interfaces . targeting a scenario where the infrastructure of transmitting and receiving antennas is meant to serve different communication standards",
    ", we assume that transmitters and receivers are _ oblivious _ to the encoding function shared by source and destination as inshamai - review @xcite .",
    "our interest is in obtaining analytical insights into the role of finite capacities @xmath6 and @xmath7 at the transmit and receive sides , respectively , on the performance of the distributed mimo  system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . to this end",
    ", we adopt a simplified channel model for the mimo channel between transmitters and receivers that corresponds to a gaussian interference network described by a single parameter @xmath8 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . beside allowing analytical tractability ,",
    "this channel is a variant of the wyner model for infrastructure networks @xcite that has been studied in a number of works ( see @xcite and @xcite for a review ) .",
    "an upper bound and achievable rates are derived .",
    "it is shown that , in certain asymptotic and non - asymptotic regimes , no loss of optimality is incurred in designing the system for nomadic applications ( i.e. , assuming oblivious transmitters and receivers ) .",
    "a source is connected via finite - capacity ( error - free ) links of capacity @xmath6 [ bit/ symbol ] to @xmath5 distributed transmitters .",
    "each transmitter has power constraint @xmath9 .",
    "the source aims at communicating with a remote destination which is in turn connected to @xmath5 distributed receivers via links of capacity @xmath10 targeting nomadic applications , transmitters and receivers are assumed to be _ oblivious _ to the encoding function shared by source and destination more specifically : ( _ i _ ) each transmitter is equipped with an independently generated standard complex gaussian codebook of size @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the length of the transmission block ) with average power @xmath9 , which is known to the source .",
    "these @xmath5 codebooks can be obtained by via , e.g. , a local public database . through the finite - capacity link ,",
    "the source selects which codeword in the codebook should be sent by each antenna in a given transmission block .",
    "in other words , no processing is carried out at the transmitters , except simple _ mapping between the index received by the source and the codebook _ ; ( _ ii _ ) each receiver is unaware of the processing carried out at the source and of the codebooks of the transmitters , and merely performs quantization of the received signals , which are then relayed to the destination ; ( _ iii _ ) the destination is assumed to be aware of the quantization scheme used at the receivers .",
    "moreover , we consider both cases in which the destination knows and does not know the codebooks of the transmitters . finally , perfect block and symbol synchronization is assumed .",
    "the complex gaussian channel between transmitters and receivers is described by a gaussian interference network as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which is further described by an interference parameter @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "this channel corresponds to the circulant version of the wyner model @xcite for cellular networks considered in various works ( see @xcite   @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "accordingly , the received signal at any given time instant by the @xmath14th receiver is given by @xmath15}+z_{m } ,   \\label{rx_signal}\\]]where @xmath16 is the complex symbol transmitted by the @xmath14th transmitter , @xmath17 $ ] represents the modulo-@xmath5 operation , and @xmath18 is complex gaussian noise with unit power ( @xmath19 ) .",

    "results will be stated here without formal proof .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for proofs and further discussion .",
    "in this section , we review some basic definitions and establish a reference result . at first , we recall that for @xmath25 and perfectly cooperating receivers ( @xmath26 ) , the signal ( rx_signal ) received by the destination of the network in fig . [ fig1 ] can be interpreted in the spatial domain as an inter - symbol - interference channel with impulse response @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is the kronecker delta function ) and frequency response wyner ( see also @xcite):@xmath29we then present two basic definitions and related results .    _ definition 1 _ : we define the waterfilling power spectral density with respect to the sum - power constraint @xmath9 and the snr power spectral density @xmath30 as @xmath31 with @xmath32 and the corresponding rate as@xmath33for short , we also define @xmath34    in @xcite , the result below is proved , following @xcite .",
    "_ lemma 1 _ : if @xmath35 , then we have:@xmath36where equality holds for @xmath37    having set the basic definitions above , we can now present an upper bound on the achievable rate between the source and destination for the network in fig .",
    "the bound also holds for the case where the transmitters and receivers are informed about the codebooks used by source and destination , and it is a straightforward consequence of cut - set arguments .    _ proposition 1 _ : the achievable rate @xmath23 is upper bounded by @xmath38with equality in ( [ upper large p ] ) for @xmath39    it should be noted that while the waterfilling solution ( [ wf ] ) is based on the total power constraint , due to the symmetry of the channel at hand ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , it also satisfies the assumed per - transmitter power constraint for any @xmath5 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the result ( [ upper large p ] ) is a consequence of lemma 1 .",
    "in this section , we consider the case in which @xmath6 is finite and @xmath40 , and derive achievable rates under the assumptions discussed above of oblivious antennas .",
    "it is noted that , due to the infinite - capacity links at the receiver side , the assumption of oblivious receivers has no impact on the results of this section .",
    "two achievable rates are derived , one that assumes knowledge at the destination of the transmitters codebooks and one that does not require such assumption .      in this section ,",
    "we consider a simple scheme that assumes that the destination is aware of the codebooks available at the transmitters .",
    "the source splits its message ( of rate @xmath41 ) into @xmath5 equal - rate messages , and delivers each to one transmitter via the finite capacity links .",
    "each transmitter then maps the rate-@xmath23 message into a codeword , using a mapping which is known at both source and destination .",
    "the destination performs joint decoding .",
    "it is noted that here the codebooks available at the sources are used directly as channel codes .",
    "the following rate is achievable .",
    "_ proposition 2 _ : let @xmath42 then , the following rate is achievable by transmitting independent messages ( i m ) from each transmitter @xmath43where @xmath44 is the maximum rate achievable with no cooperation ( nc ) among the transmitters and @xmath26 , which is given by @xmath45    _ remark 1 _ : it is easy to see that this scheme is optimal ( i.e. , it achieves the upper bound ( [ upper ] ) ) if @xmath46 ( and thus in particular if @xmath47 instead , when @xmath48 , the rate achievable by this scheme does not achieve the upper bound ( [ upper ] ) , suffering from the performance penalty caused by independent encoding as compared to the waterfilling solution ( [ wf ] ) @xcite .",
    "here we consider an alternative transmission scheme in which the transmitters codewords are assumed to be unknown to the destination , and thus are exploited by the source merely as quantization codebooks ( of size @xmath49 as explained in the following .",
    "the source performs encoding for the @xmath5-antenna transmitter according to the waterfilling solution ( [ wf ] ) , then it quantizes the obtained codewords using the codebooks available at the transmitters , and send the corresponding index to the given transmitter .",
    "any transmitter simply transmits the codeword corresponding to the received indices , following our assumptions .",
    "the performance of this scheme can be proved to correspond to that of a fully cooperative mimo system with additional ( colored ) noise due to quantization , as stated in the following proposition .",

    "moreover , for large capacity @xmath55 , it is easy to see from ( [ robl_tx ] ) that we have @xmath56 this contrasts with the case of independent message transmission studied above , where the upper bound was not achievable for large @xmath57",
    "in this section , we focus on the scenario characterized by finite @xmath58 and @xmath59 it is noted that , dually to the scenario considered in sec .",
    "[ sec_finite_tx ] , here the assumption of oblivious transmitters has no impact on the results .",
    "we recall that we assume oblivious receivers in the sense specified in sec .",
    "[ sec sys ] .",
    "following @xcite , we consider achievable rates with two quantization strategies carried out at the receivers , in order of complexity .",
    "the first is based on elementary compression , whereby correlation between the signals received by different antennas is not exploited for compression , and the second is based on distributed compression techniques . in both cases ,",
    "we use gaussian test channels for compression .      with elementary compression ,",
    "correlation among the received signals is not exploited in the design of the quantization functions .",

    "remark 3 _ : from ( [ rec ] ) , it can be seen that for extremely large snr@xmath65 ( and if the condition on @xmath7 stated above holds)@xmath66 the rate achieved with elementary compression is@xmath67which is smaller than the upper bound ( [ upper ] ) @xmath68 for @xmath69 this shows that there is a penalty to be paid for obliviousness at the receive side , at least if elementary compression is employed , even when @xmath70 .",
    "moreover , for large capacity @xmath26 , we clearly have optimal performance @xmath71      the premise of the scheme discussed in this section is the observation that , since decoding of all quantization codewords takes place at the destination , the correlation of the signals observed at the receivers can be leveraged in order to decrease the equivalent quantization noise .",

    "finally , it can be seen that for large capacity @xmath26 , we have @xmath81",
    "in the two previous sections , we have considered the two limiting cases @xmath82 ( sec .",
    "[ sec_finite_tx ] ) and @xmath83 ( sec .",
    "[ sec_finite_rx ] ) , and constructed basic transmission and reception strategies based on oblivious antennas , namely , transmission of independent messages ( i m ) versus quantized waterfilling ( qw ) at the transmit side , and elementary ( ec )  versus distributed compression ( dc ) at the receive side .",
    "these techniques can be combined giving rise to four transmission/ reception strategies ( im - ec , im - dc , qw - ec and qw - dc ) , as discussed below .",
    "it is recalled that , when using transmission of independent messages , it is assumed that the destination is aware of the codebooks available at the transmitters .    _ proposition 6 _ : the following rate is achievable by transmitting independent messages ( i m ) and using elementary compression ( ec ) at the receive side:@xmath84with @xmath85 and @xmath86 as in ( [ nec ] ) ( we have dropped the dependence on @xmath87 @xmath7 for the sake of legibility ) .",
    "_ remark 5 _ : the result in proposition 2 can be found as a special case of proposition 6 for @xmath42 moreover , this scheme is optimal whenever the second term in ( [ imec ] ) is larger than @xmath88 for @xmath89as shown in @xcite , the scheme is not optimal and when @xmath90 @xmath26 , the we have @xmath91 thus suffering from the performance loss due to transmission of independent messages ( see  remark 2 ) .      _ proposition 7 _ : the following rate is achievable by transmitting independent messages ( i m ) and using distributed compression ( dc ) at the receive side:@xmath92with @xmath93 ( @xmath94 and @xmath95    _ remark 6 _ : proposition 2 follows from proposition 7 when @xmath96 moreover , as for the previous scheme , optimality is guaranteed if the second term in ( [ r_imdc ] ) is larger than the capacity @xmath97 .",
    "however , optimality is also attained with @xmath70 ( see also remark 4 ) , while for @xmath6 and @xmath98 we have @xmath99      we recall that , unlike the previous two subsections , the scheme considered here , based on quantized waterfilling , does not require the destination to be aware of the codebooks available at the transmitters .",
