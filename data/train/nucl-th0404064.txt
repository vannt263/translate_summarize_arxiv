    "the study of the properties of hadrons in a hot and dense medium is an important problem in strong interaction physics .",
    "it is a topic of active research interest as it has direct implications in heavy - ion collision experiments , as well as in the study of astrophysical compact objects like neutron stars .",
    "the medium modifications of hadrons are probed in the relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments . in particular , at cern - sps , the experimentally observed dilepton spectra @xcite have been attributed to the medium modifications of the spectral properties of the vector mesons , especially of the @xmath6-meson @xcite and can not be explained by the vacuum hadronic properties .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath7 production from nuclear collisions at gsi - sis energies of 1 - 2 agev have shown that in - medium properties of the kaons have been seen in the collective flow pattern of @xmath8 mesons as well as in the abundancy and spectra of antikaons @xcite .",
    "the medium modifications of @xmath0(@xmath9 ) mesons , which show analogy to the @xmath10(@xmath11 ) mesons resulting from replacing s - quark ( s - antiquark ) by the c - quark ( c - antiquark ) , have also become a subject of recent interest @xcite . the medium changes for @xmath0-mesons can have important consequences for the open charm enhancement in nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite as well as for j/@xmath12 suppression as observed at the sps @xcite .",
    "the na50 collaboration has claimed to see an open charm enhancement by up to a factor of three in central @xmath13 collisions at 158 a@xmath14gev @xcite .",
    "the medium modifications of the open charm mesons ( @xmath0(@xmath9 ) ) can also modify the high mass ( @xmath15 ) dilepton spectra @xcite since they can be produced abundantly in high energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "transverse momentum spectra of electrons from @xmath16 collisions at @xmath17 gev have been measured at midrapidity by the phenix experiment at rhic @xcite .",
    "the spectra show an excess above the background from decays of light hadrons and photon conversion . the observed signal is consistent with that expected from semi - leptonic decays of charmed mesons .    in high energy heavy - ion collisions at rhic ( @xmath18 200 gev ) , an appreciable contribution of j/@xmath12 suppression",
    "is expected to be due to the formation of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "however , the medium modification of @xmath0-mesons should modify the @xmath19 absorption in hot and dense nuclear medium and can provide a possible explanation for @xmath19 suppression .",
    "the effect of the hadron absorption of j/@xmath12 s is found to be not negligible @xcite .",
    "it is thus of importance to understand the interactions of the @xmath0-mesons in the hadronic medium for @xmath19 production as well .    at finite densities ,",
    "the medium modification of the @xmath0-meson mass has been studied using the qcd sum rule ( qsr ) approach @xcite . due to the presence of a light quark in the d - meson",
    ", the mass modification of the @xmath0-meson has a large contribution from the light quark condensates .",
    "the large shift of mass ( @xmath20 50 mev at nuclear matter density , @xmath21 ) in the @xmath0-mesons is originated from the contribution of the @xmath22 term in the operator product expansion .",
    "the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model predicts a mass drop of the @xmath0-meson to be of the order of 60 mev at @xmath23 @xcite , which is very similar to the value obtained in the qcd sum rule calculations of refs .  @xcite . at finite temperatures , the studies of quarkonium dissociation @xcite using heavy quark potential from lattice qcd",
    "@xcite suggest a similar drop of the @xmath0-meson mass .    in a recent work ,",
    "the mass modification of the @xmath0-meson in hot and dense matter , arising due to its interaction with the light hadron sector , was studied in a chiral effective model @xcite .",
    "the chiral su(3 ) model , used to study the hadronic properties in the hot hyperonic matter @xcite was generalized to su(4 ) to include the charmed mesons .",
    "interactions of the @xmath0-meson with the light hadron sector were derived to study the in - medium mass of the @xmath0-meson .    in all these investigations ,",
    "the spectral features of a @xmath0-meson embedded in hot and dense matter have not been studied .",
    "coupled - channel effects as well as dressing of intermediate propagators have been completely ignored , which turned out to be crucial for describing the strange counter part of the @xmath0-meson , the @xmath10 meson in the nuclear medium . in the present investigation , the spectral density for the @xmath0-meson is calculated using a self - consistent coupled - channel g - matrix calculation .",
    "the medium effects like the pauli blocking on the nucleons in the intermediate states and the effects from the dressing of the @xmath0-mesons , nucleons as well as pions are investigated .",
    "the coupled - channel formalism generates dynamically the @xmath5 resonance , like the @xmath24 resonance for the case of antikaons .",
    "we have organized the present paper as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] we first review our formalism .",
    "our results are presented and discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] and the concluding remarks are given in sect .  [",
    "sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we present the formalism to obtain the self - energy or single - particle potential of a d - meson embedded in infinite symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "this self - energy accounts for the interaction of the d - meson with the nucleons and its calculation requires the knowledge of the in - medium @xmath25 interaction , which will be described by a @xmath26-matrix .",
    "the medium effects incorporated in this @xmath26-matrix include the pauli blocking on the nucleons in the intermediate states as well as the dressing of the d - meson , nucleons and pions .",
    "the effective @xmath25 interaction in the nuclear medium or @xmath26-matrix is obtained from the bare @xmath25 interaction , in a similiar way as done in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath27 interaction .",
    "however , in this case , only the in - medium s - wave @xmath25 interaction is considered taking , as a bare interaction , a separable potential model as done for the @xmath28 interaction in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the separable potential we use the following ansatz in momentum space @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the coupling constant and @xmath3 the cutoff .",
    "these two parameters will be determined by fixing the position and the width of the @xmath5 resonance , the analogous to the @xmath24 resonance in the charm sector . for the interaction matrix @xmath31 ,",
    "we use the standard result derived from su(3 ) flavor symmetry (  @xcite ) .",
    "this bare interaction allows for the transition from @xmath25 to other channels , namely , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , all having charm @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , we are confronted with a coupled - channel problem . in principle , one should use su(4 ) symmetry as we incorporate charmed mesons .",
    "however , channels with a strange and charm quarks such as @xmath37 , @xmath38 or @xmath39 have not been considered due to the fact that their respective masses are well above the @xmath25 threshold ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dmeson0 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we only consider channels with up , down and charm - quark content keeping the su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "the resultant meson - baryon @xmath26-matrices can be grouped in a matrix notation , where each box corresponds to one channel .",
    "the @xmath25 channel can have isospin @xmath40 or @xmath41 . in the first case , it couples to the @xmath33 and @xmath34 channels and the corresponding matrix has the following structure    @xmath42    while for @xmath41 it can couple to the @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath35 channels    @xmath43    keeping this structure in mind , the @xmath26-matrix is formally given by    @xmath44    in eq .",

    "the function @xmath51 stands for the pauli operator which allows only intermediate nucleon states compatible with the pauli principle .",
    "the energy variable @xmath52 is the so - called starting energy while @xmath53 is the invariant center - of - mass energy , i.e. , @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the total meson - baryon four momentum in a frame in which nuclear matter is at rest .    the former equation for the @xmath26-matrix has to be considered together with a prescription for the single - particle energies of all the mesons and baryons participating in the reaction and in the intermediate states .",
    "these energies can be written as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the single - particle potential of each meson ( baryon ) calculated at the real quasiparticle energy @xmath58 . for baryons ,",
    "this quasiparticle - energy is given by @xmath59 while , for mesons , it is obtained by solving the following equation @xmath60    in the present paper we have considered the single - particle potential for the @xmath0-meson , nucleons and pions together with the decay width of the @xmath50 meson .",
    "the reason for the inclusion of this width will be clarified in the results section .    for nucleons , as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have used a relativistic @xmath61 model , where the scalar and vector coupling constants , @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively , are density dependent @xcite .",
    "one of the most important modifications comes from the introduction of the pion self - energy , @xmath64 , in the intermediate @xmath65 and @xmath66 states present in the construction of the effective @xmath1 interaction .",
    "the pion is dressed with the momentum and energy - dependent self - energy @xcite which was also studied in ref .",
    "this self - energy incorporates a p - wave piece built up from the coupling to @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 excitations , together with short - range correlations .",
    "the model also contains a small and constant s - wave part .",
    "the @xmath0-meson single - particle potential in the brueckner - hartree - fock approach is schematically given by @xmath70 where the summation over nucleon states is limited by the nucleon fermi momentum . as it can be easily seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : self ] ) , since the effective @xmath1 interaction ( @xmath26-matrix ) depends on the @xmath0-meson single - particle energy , which in turn depends on the @xmath0-meson potential , we are confronted with a self - consistent problem .",
    "we also note that the @xmath26-matrix in the above equation becomes complex due to the possibility of @xmath0@xmath49 state decaying into the @xmath65 and @xmath66 channels . as a consequence ,",
    "the potential @xmath71 is also a complex quantity .",
    "further details are given in the next section .",
    "the @xmath26-matrix equation for the s - wave in - medium @xmath1 interaction in the partial wave basis using the quantum numbers of the relative and center - of - mass motion reads @xmath72 where the variables @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 are the relative momenta and @xmath76 is the linear center - of - mass momentum .",
    "the functions @xmath77 and @xmath78 are , respectively , the square of the momentum of the baryon and that of the meson in the intermediate states , averaged over the angle between the total momentum @xmath79 and the relative momentum @xmath80 ( see appendix a in ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath81 the angle average of the pauli operator , @xmath82 , differs from unity only for the @xmath83 channel ( for details see appendix a in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "for the s - wave component of the @xmath25 interaction , the brueckner - hartree - fock approximation to the single - particle potential of a @xmath0-meson embedded in a fermi sea of nucleons [ eq .  ( [ eq : self ] ) ] becomes @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the square of the center - of - mass momentum and nucleon momentum , respectively , averaged over the angle between the external @xmath87-meson momentum in the lab system , @xmath88 , and the @xmath83 relative momentum , @xmath89 , used as integration variable in eq .",
    "( [ eq : upot1 ] ) ( see appendix b in ref .",

    "( [ eq : upot1 ] ) by @xmath99 .",
    "this self - energy can then be used to determine the @xmath0-meson single - particle propagator in the medium , @xmath100 and the corresponding spectral density @xmath101    in fact , only the value of the potential @xmath71 at the quasiparticle energy @xmath102 is determined self - consistently .",
    "this amounts to taking , in the subsequent iterations leading to self - consistency , the so - called  quasiparticle \" approximation to the @xmath87-meson propagator @xmath103 which gives rise to a simplified spectral strength @xmath104 the location and width of the peak in this distribution are determined , respectively , by the real and imaginary parts of @xmath105 .",
    "this self - consistent scheme was also used in previous works for the @xmath106 meson @xcite and , although it represents a simplification with respect to the more sophiscated scheme followed in refs .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath10 case where the full energy dependence of the @xmath10 self - energy is self - consistent determined , the approximation is sufficiently good as already shown in refs .",
    "we start this section by showing the mass distribution of the @xmath33 state in fig .  [",
    "fig : dmeson1 ] .",
    "the mass distribution is given by @xmath107 where c is related to the particular reaction generating the @xmath33 state prior to final state interactions , @xmath108 is the @xmath33 relative momentum and @xmath109 is the isospin zero component of the on - shell s - wave t - matrix for the @xmath33 channel .",
    "the study of the mass distribution of the @xmath33 state in the @xmath40 channel reflects the @xmath5 resonance as seen in fig .",

    "the mass distribution of the @xmath33 state for @xmath40 is displayed as a function of the c.m .",
    "energy for different sets of coupling constants @xmath30 and cutoffs @xmath3 .",
    "we observe that our coupled - channel calculation generates dynamically the @xmath5 resonance .",
    "the position ( @xmath110 mev ) and width ( @xmath111 mev ) are obtained for a given set of coupling constants and cutoffs in the range between 0.8 and 1.4 gev .",
    "this resonance was also obtained in the framework of the @xmath112-bs(3 ) approach based on the chiral su(3 ) lagrangian and formulated in terms of the bethe - salpeter equation @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the set of coupling constants and cuttoffs that generate the resonance are very similar to the ones used in the @xmath113 sector to reproduce dynamically the @xmath24 resonance @xcite .",
    "once the position and width of the @xmath5 resonance are reproduced dynamically , we study the effect of the different medium modifications on the resonance .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the resulting in - medium s - wave @xmath25 amplitudes in the @xmath40 channel for @xmath114 gev and @xmath115=13.4 and for a total momentum @xmath116 are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmeson2 ] as a function of the invariant center - of - mass energy for different approaches : t - matrix calculation ( dotted lines ) , including pauli blocking ( dot - dashed lines ) and self - consistent calculation for the @xmath0-meson ( solid lines ) at nuclear matter saturation density @xmath117 @xmath118 . due to the fact that the resonance lies just few mev above the @xmath33 threshold",
    ", we have included the decay width of the @xmath50 baryon in our calculations by considering the corresponding imaginary part for the @xmath50 self - energy . in this way",
    ", the resonance is reproduced in a more realistic way , even below the @xmath33 state .",
    "we clearly see , as noticed already for the @xmath24 resonance , the repulsive effect of the pauli blocking on the resonance , being generated at higher energies .",
    "however , as already pointed out for the @xmath119 interaction , the shift in energy of the @xmath5 resonance is intimately connected with the energy dependence of the @xmath25 interaction and changes are expected from a self - consistent incorporation of the @xmath0-meson properties in the @xmath1 interaction .",
    "therefore , the effect of dressing the @xmath0-meson with the complete complex self - energy on the in - medium @xmath25 amplitude makes the resonance peak stay pretty close or even at lower energies than its free space location .",
    "this is due to the attraction felt by the @xmath0-meson that compensates the repulsive effect induced by pauli blocking on the nucleon , as already seen for the @xmath24 resonance in refs .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath25 amplitude become much smoother because of the @xmath0-meson strength being spread out over energies .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmeson3 ] we display the previous plot of the real and imaginary parts of the s - wave @xmath40 @xmath1 amplitude together with the @xmath41 channel for a larger energy scale and a smaller range in the y - axis .",
    "apart from the previous three approaches , t - matrix calculation ( dotted lines ) , in - medium calculation only including pauli blocking effects ( dot - dashed lines ) and self - consistent calculation for the @xmath0- meson potential ( solid lines ) , we also include the in - medium properties of the nucleons together with the pion self - energy in the self - consistent process for the d - meson potential ( long - dashed lines ) .",
    "while the nucleon dressing only shifts the @xmath5 resonance in energy , as seen for the @xmath24 resonance , the pion dressing could introduce important changes to the previous self - consistent procedure . in this approach and for @xmath40 ,",
    "the imaginary part of the @xmath25 interaction becomes smoother in the region of energies where the @xmath5 resonance was generated in the previous three approaches . for energies below the @xmath33 threshold ,",
    "we observe a bump around 2.5 gev that , in our self - consistent many - body approach , can decay to states such as @xmath120 or @xmath121 , where in parentheses we have denoted an example for the component of the @xmath47 and @xmath0-meson that show up at energies below @xmath33 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also interesting to observe a second structure in the @xmath40 amplitude , already seen for the three initial approaches , which lies below the @xmath1 threshold of 2.806 gev .",
    "this feature in the imaginary part around 2.75 gev seems to be enhanced in the full self - consistent procedure .",
    "this structure , like the previous one , is also a state with the @xmath2-like quantum numbers and , in this case , it can decay to the @xmath33 state . whether the first resonant structure is the in - medium @xmath5 resonance and",
    "the second bump is a new resonance is something that deserves further studies .",
    "note that the energy region of interest for the calculation of the @xmath0-meson potential for @xmath40 lies on the right - hand side of the free @xmath5 resonance where this second structure shows up for all approaches . actually , this is a different feature of the @xmath25 interaction compared to the case of the @xmath119 interaction .",
    "the @xmath119 interaction was basically determined by the behaviour of the s - wave @xmath1220 @xmath24 resonance in the medium . for the @xmath41 component of the @xmath1 interaction , the self - consistent calculation tends to dilute any structure present in the t - matrix .",
    "it is seen that for the full self - consistent calculation , the @xmath41 component is considerably reduced . a more detailed analysis concerning the @xmath25 interaction and , hence",
    ", the @xmath0-meson potential is presented in the following plots .    in fig .  [",
    "fig : dmeson4 ] we plot the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath0-meson potential at @xmath123 as a function of density for @xmath124 gev and @xmath12513.4 and for the three previous in - medium calculations : in - medium calculation with only pauli blocking ( dot - dashed lines ) , self - consistent calculation for the @xmath0-meson ( solid lines ) and self - consistent calculation for the @xmath0-meson including the dressing of nucleons and the self - energy of pions ( long - dashed lines ) .",
    "the @xmath0-meson potential becomes more attractive as we increase the density in all three approaches , showing a less smooth behaviour in the case when nucleons and pions are dressed both in the real and imaginary parts .",
    "however , the potential turns out to be more attractive for a self - consistent calculation with respect to the case when only pauli blocking is considered .",
    "if we compare these results to the case of the @xmath10 potential , the picture depicted here is different . for the @xmath10 meson case , the shift of the @xmath24 resonance in energy due to the pauli blocking changes the @xmath119 scattering amplitude at the threshold from being repulsive to attractive giving rise to an attractive @xmath10 potential .",
    "however , when the properties of @xmath10 were incorporated self - consistently , the attraction was drastically reduced @xcite . for the @xmath0-meson ,",
    "the @xmath25 threshold is 2.806 gev and , therefore , the @xmath25 amplitude is studied for energies on the right - hand side of the free @xmath5 resonance , away from this resonant structure .",
    "furthermore , in the @xmath10 meson case , the s - wave @xmath40 @xmath119 amplitude turns out to be the main contribution to the @xmath10 potential due to the presence of the @xmath24 resonance . for the @xmath0-meson , as the energy region of interest is not sitting on the resonance , the @xmath41 could also become important in the calculation of the @xmath0-meson potential . in order to study the isospin dependence of in - medium @xmath25 interaction in more detail as well as the dependence on the chosen set of coupling constants and cutoffs , in fig .",

    "[ fig : dmeson5 ] ) , the real parts of the @xmath40 and @xmath41 components turn out to be of the same order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , it is not clear which isospin will determine the behaviour of the @xmath0-meson potential . actually , the potential depends on the exact value of both contributions taking into account the isospin factor @xmath126 for each isospin component ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : upot1 ] ) ) . for @xmath124 gev ,",
    "the main contribution for the potential at @xmath23 comes from the @xmath41 component , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmeson7 ] . on the other hand",
    ", we note that for @xmath127 gev , the @xmath40 component moves from attraction to repulsion as the energy increases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dmeson5 ] ) . nevertheless , the region of integration to obtain the @xmath0-meson potential for all the sets of parameters of coupling constants and cutoffs lies around 2.80 - 2.84 gev at @xmath23 and , therefore , we obtain a repulsive effect for @xmath40 and an attractive effect for @xmath41 in the potential at @xmath23 for all sets ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dmeson7 ] for @xmath124 gev ) .",
    "the imaginary part displays a smoother behaviour than in the case of the full self - consistent calculation . when the full calculation is performed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dmeson6 ] ) , the peak observed around energies of 2.75 gev gets diluted with increasing cutoff .",
    "however , the real part shows more structure than in the previous self - consistent approach and the @xmath40 component becomes more important with respect to the previous case . this effect together with a less important contribution of the @xmath41 component makes the @xmath40 govern the @xmath0-meson potential for densities larger than @xmath128 for all sets . for @xmath23 and @xmath124 gev",
    ", the attractive @xmath41 component still dominates . what it is not so clear is whether the @xmath40 will be attractive or repulsive for all the sets as the region of integration lies around 2.71 - 2.78 , where the @xmath40 real part changes in sign .",
    "the different region of the integration in this last case with respect to the case where only the @xmath0-meson is dressed is mainly due to the inclusion of an attractive potential for the nucleons as the value of the @xmath0-meson potential does not change by a great amount for both self - consistent processes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dmeson7 ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmeson7 ] we observe that , in the case where only the @xmath0-meson is dressed and for @xmath124 gev , the real part of the @xmath0-meson potential is governed by the @xmath41 component as density grows .",
    "this is also seen for the other set of parameters studied . on the other hand , for the full calculation , the @xmath40 component controls the behaviour of the @xmath0-meson potential as we increase the density not only for @xmath124 gev but also for the other sets .",
    "this is due to the resonant structure seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmeson6 ] that also causes a less smooth behaviour of the @xmath0-meson potential .    in order to study the dependence on the cutoff and coupling",
    "constant , we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : dmeson8 ] the @xmath0-meson potential at @xmath123 as a function of the density for different sets of coupling constants and cutoffs and for the two approaches mentioned before .",
    "when only the @xmath0-meson is dressed , higher densities are required in order to obtain an attractive potential with respect to the full self - consistent calculation . in both cases , the @xmath0-meson potential tends to get more attractive as density increases .",
    "the reason is that , in order to obtain the @xmath0-meson potential as density increases , we are integrating over a larger energy region where the interaction is attractive .",
    "however , as mentioned in the previous plot , the isospin component responsible for that behaviour is different depending on the approach . on the other hand ,",
    "the value of the potential turns out to be slightly sensitive to the chosen set of parameters .",
    "there is , however , in both cases a density for which all sets give the same value for the @xmath0-meson potential .",
    "when only the @xmath0-meson is dressed , we obtain a range of values for the @xmath0-meson potential at @xmath23 between 8.6 mev for @xmath127 gev and -11.2 mev for @xmath129 gev . for the full self - consistent calculation ,",
    "the range of values covered lies in between 2.6 mev for @xmath127 gev and -12.3 mev for @xmath129 gev .",
    "this result would indicate that our self - consistent coupled - channel calculation gives a different prediction for the @xmath0-meson potential as compared to the calculations based on the qcd sum - rule approach @xcite , the quark - meson coupling model @xcite , lattice calculations @xcite and a recent work based on a chiral model that obtains the medium modification of the mass of d - meson due to its interaction with the light hadron sector @xcite .",
    "the calculations based on the qcd sum rule approach as well as quark - meson coupling model predict the mass drop of the d - meson to be of the order of 50 - 60 mev at nuclear matter density .",

    "an interaction lagrangian based on chiral perturbation theory also gives a similar shift at nuclear matter density , when the tomozawa - weinberg interaction is supplemented by the attractive dn sigma term and the charm content of the nucleon is ignored @xcite . on the other hand , the effective chiral lagrangian approach @xcite is seen to yield a larger drop of the d - meson masses ( @xmath20 200 mev at nuclear matter density ) . in the present calculation ,",
    "the coupled - channel effects seem to result in an overall drastic reduction of the in - medium effects independent of the parameters ( @xmath30,@xmath3 ) and the in - medium properties of the intermediate states compared to the previous works .    finally , once",
    "self - consistency is reached , we calculate the full energy dependence of the @xmath0-meson self - energy which defines the in - medium @xmath0-meson single - particle propagator and its spectral density ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : prop]-[eq : spec ] ) ) . the spectral density at zero momentum is shown in fig .  [ fig : dmeson9 ] for @xmath124 gev and for several densities in the two approaches considered before .",
    "in the case when only the @xmath0-meson is dressed in the self - consistent process , the peak of the @xmath0-meson pole moves towards lower energies as density increases since the @xmath0-meson potential becomes more attractive for @xmath124 gev ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dmeson8 ] ) .",
    "moreover , it is observed that the @xmath0-meson spectral density falls off more slowly on the left - hand side of the quasiparticle peak as density increases .",
    "this is due to the @xmath41 component of the off - shell @xmath0-meson self - energy , which is related to the @xmath0-meson potential through eq .",
    "( [ eq : relation ] ) . as density increases",
    ", we have already discussed that the @xmath41 component governs the behaviour of the potential and , hence , the self - energy . therefore , any structure lying close the quasiparticle peak is enhanced and clearly visible in the spectral density . on the other hand",
    ", we also notice some structure of the spectral density to the left of the quasiparticle peak at energies of the @xmath0-meson of around 1.63 - 1.65 gev , the origin of which could be traced back to the presence of the @xmath5 resonance .    for the full self - consistent calculation , the quasiparticle peak moves towards lower energies as density increases according to the behaviour of the @xmath0-meson potential seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmeson8 ] , although there is region of densities around @xmath130 where the @xmath0-meson potential turns out to be repulsive .",
    "for densities between @xmath21 and 1.5 @xmath21 , the quasiparticle peak mixes with a structure , already noticed on the left - hand side of the quasiparticle peak for 0.5 @xmath21 , making it more difficult to separate the contribution of the quasiparticle peak and the effect of this structure .",
    "this bump in the spectral density is due to the structure observed in the imaginary part of the @xmath40 component of the in - medium @xmath25 interaction which lies close to the @xmath25 threshold .",
    "the nature of this structure and in - medium changes of the d - meson production could probably be studied experimentally in the near future with the panda experiment at the gsi international facility in darmstadt @xcite .",
    "we have performed a microscopic self - consistent coupled - channel calculation of the single - particle potential of the @xmath0-meson and , hence the @xmath0-meson spectral density , embedded in symmetric nuclear matter assuming a separable potential for the s - wave @xmath1 interaction .",
    "the @xmath5 resonance , which is the counterpart of the @xmath24 in the charm sector , has been generated dynamically for a given set of coupling constants @xmath30 and cutoffs @xmath3 .",
    "we have also studied the medium effects on the @xmath5 resonance and , hence on the @xmath0-meson potential , due to the pauli blocking of the intermediate nucleonic states as well as due to the dressing of nucleons and pions .",
    "the @xmath0-meson optical potential has been obtained for different approaches : in - medium calculation including only pauli blocking on the intermediate nucleonic states , self - consistent calculation for the @xmath0-meson and self - consistent calculation for the @xmath0-meson including the dressing of nucleons and the pion self - energy .",
    "we observe that the two self - consistent schemes show a stronger density dependence compared to the case when only pauli blocking effects are included .",
    "when only the @xmath0-meson is dressed in the self - consistent procedure , the @xmath0-meson potential at @xmath23 stays between 8.6 mev for @xmath127 gev and -11.2 mev for @xmath129 gev . for the full self - consistent calculation",
    ", the range of values covered lies in between 2.6 mev for @xmath127 gev and -12.3 mev for @xmath129 gev .",
    "we conclude that the coupled - channel effects seem to result in an overall reduction of the in - medium effects independent of the set of parameters ( @xmath30,@xmath3 ) and the in - medium properties of the intermediate states compared to previous work .",
    "the isospin dependence of the @xmath0-meson in both approaches have been also analyzed . while the @xmath41 amplitude governs the behaviour of the @xmath0-meson potential when only @xmath0-mesons are dressed , the @xmath0-meson",
    "is basically determined by the @xmath40 component in the full self - consistent calculation .",
    "the @xmath0-meson spectral density has been finally obtained for both self - consistent schemes .",
    "although the quasiparticle peak stays closer to its free position in both cases for nuclear matter saturation density , the features of the low - energy region on the left - hand side of the quasiparticle peak are different according to the different in - medium behaviour of the @xmath5 resonance in both approaches .",
    "the in - medium effects devised in this work can be studied in heavy - ion experiments at the future international facility at gsi .",
    "the panda experiment at gsi @xcite will measure hadrons with charm by antiproton beams on nuclei with its microvertex detector .",
    "in - medium changes of open charm hadrons can be addressed by the study of the excitation function and the correlation function of @xmath0- and @xmath9-mesons .",
    "we stress that , although the in - medium potential for @xmath0-mesons has turned out to be quite small in our investigation , the production of @xmath0-meson in the nuclear medium will be still enhanced due to the additional strength of the @xmath0-meson spectral function below the quasiparticlepeak .",
    "this effect is similar to the one extracted for the enhanced @xmath10 production in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the present coupled - channel approach to the @xmath0-meson properties in the nuclear medium is , as the first of its kind , exploratory and can be improved by incorporating relativistic potentials as well as chiral constraints on the bare hadronic interactions",
    ". it will be also interesting to explore the in - medium effects for @xmath0-mesons in dynamical approaches for studying e.g.  the excitation function , which we will leave for future work .",
