    "near - infrared ( nir ) observations ( 0.92.5@xmath0 ) are important in practically all areas of astronomy and astrophysics .",
    "for example , low - mass stars and brown dwarfs emit a substantial fraction of their light at these wavelengths and nir spectroscopy is the most efficient way to study these objects .",
    "nir spectroscopy is also one of the best ways to study the early universe because optical and ultraviolet emission lines from distant galaxies are redshifted to nir wavelengths due to hubble expansion .",
    "unfortunately , deep nir observations from the ground are extremely difficult to make due to the presence of a bright atmospheric background .",
    "the background in the range 0.91.8@xmath0 is predominantly from the de - excitation of atmospheric hydroxyl ( oh ) molecules at an altitude of @xmath1 90 km @xcite .",
    "the nir background is @xmath1 1000 times brighter than the optical background and can not be simply subtracted from astronomical observations @xcite because its brightness fluctuates on short timescales @xcite .",
    "solving the nir sky background problem is an important challenge in observational astronomy .",
    "previous attempts at a ground - based solution have not been able to suppress oh emission lines over a broad wavelength range while maintaining high throughput between the lines , which is critical for a wide range of science cases .",
    "for example , observations may be made in a very narrow wavelength range between oh emission lines using ultra - narrow band filters @xcite .",
    "however , this requires a specific unambiguously identifiable feature within the narrow wavelength range from the object . as a result",
    ", the number and nature of objects that may be observed by this technique is severely limited .",
    "more sophisticated approaches attempt to remove oh emission lines by dispersing the light with a diffraction grating at high resolution , selectively masking out the oh lines , and then recombining the light @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the diffraction grating and the system optics ( which the light must pass through twice ) unavoidably scatters the bright oh light and the scattered portions can not be effectively removed .",
    "thus , oh emission lines are better dealt with before the light reaches any dispersing element .",
    "there have been attempts to use holographic filters for this purpose .",
    "@xcite demonstrated a device with 10 notches 10db deep and 0.1 nm wide with 85% throughput between the notches .",
    "using several of these holographic filters in series would be sufficient to suppress on the order of 100 oh doublets pre - dispersion , but the internotch throughput would be very low in this configuration .",
    "see @xcite for an in - depth comparison of these oh suppression techniques .",
    "oh suppression using aperiodic fiber bragg gratings @xcite overcomes many of the shortcomings of these previous approaches and is the best available solution to the nir sky background problem from the ground @xcite .",
    "fiber bragg gratings ( fbgs ) are common photonic devices widely used in telecommunications .",
    "basic fbgs are single - mode fibers ( smfs ) with a periodic refractive index modulation written into the fiber core by exposing it to ultraviolet light .",
    "the periodic refractive index modulation induces strong reflections at the bragg wavelength , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the spatial period of the refractive index modulation , and @xmath4 is the effective index of the core .",
    "reflectivities close to 100% and narrow bandwidths of 0.1 nm are possible with simple periodic fbgs @xcite .    however , basic periodic fbgs have limited use for oh suppression .",
    "each periodic index modulation can be thought of as producing a single notch .",
    "a very large number of periodic index modulations would be required to suppress the dense forest of oh lines in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands .",
    "writing multiple periodic index modulations in succession in the same fiber results in high loss in the spectral regions between the notches because of the excessive exposure to ultraviolet light @xcite .",
    "aperiodic fbgs are designed with all notches treated simultaneously resulting in a single complex refractive index modulation that encodes @xmath150 irregularly spaced notches over a span of @xmath1100 nm with high internotch throughput .",
    "figure [ fig : afbgresponse ] shows the wavelength response of a single aperiodic fbg with 50 notches between 1.47 and 1.58@xmath0 .",
    "aperiodic fbgs are an attractive means of filtering atmospheric oh lines . however , when used in astronomy , where the wavefront exiting the telescope is distorted by atmospheric turbulence , coupling light into small core diameter smfs is challenging . as a result ,",
    "large core diameter multi - mode fibers ( mmfs ) are more commonly used in astronomy .",
    "unfortunately , mmfs smear out the narrow notches of fbgs into broad , shallow notches because the bragg condition is different for each fiber mode .",
    "oh suppression requires a fiber with the light collecting ability of an mmf and the suppression characteristics of an smf fbg .",
    "the solution to this problem is a device called a photonic lantern @xcite .",
    "the device consists of a multi - mode ( mm ) port connected to an array of smfs by a taper transition .",
    "the photonic lantern converts the modes of the mm port into the supermodes of the smf array and vice versa . by splicing photonic lanterns to an array of fbgs",
    ", we have an `` oh suppression fiber '' that is easy to couple light into and exhibits the exact same transmission characteristics as an fbg in an smf .",
    "the gnosis grating unit is the first oh suppression unit to utilize these oh suppression fibers .",
    "it is independent of telescope and spectrograph but we commissioned the unit at the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) at siding spring observatory with the existing iris2 infrared imaging spectrograph @xcite to demonstrate the potential of oh suppression fibers .",
    "in addition to the grating unit , gnosis consists of a fore - optics unit and an iris2 interface unit , which connects the grating unit to the telescope and spectrograph , respectively .",
    "the optical light path is shown in figure [ fig : opticalpath ] .",
    "light exiting the back of the aat is collected by a 7 element integral field unit ( ifu ) spanning 1.2@xmath7 mounted inside the fore - optics unit .",
    "the light is transported by a fiber bundle to the grating unit , where oh suppression occurs .",
    "the oh suppressed light is transported by another fiber bundle to the iris2 spectrograph for measurement .    in this paper",
    ", we present the design and performance of each gnosis subsystem and as a whole .",
    "we begin by discussing the two components of our oh suppression fibers , the fbgs and the photonic lanterns in sections [ section : fbg ] and [ section : photoniclantern ] .",
    "the oh suppression fibers are housed in the gnosis grating unit , which is described in section [ section : gratingunit ] . in sections [ section : foreoptics ] and [ section : iris2interface ] we discuss the gnosis fore - optics unit and iris2 interface unit , which connects the grating unit to the telescope and iris2 , respectively . section [ section : onsky ] summarizes the on - sky performance of gnosis and section [ section : discussion ] contains a discussion on the future of oh suppression fibers .     with the best - fitting butterworth profile ( red line ) .",
    "the notch is deep , narrow , and square , which is ideal for oh suppression.[fig : h1notch],scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "the gnosis oh suppression fibers utilize two complex , multi - notch aperiodic fbgs @xcite in series to suppress oh lines over two - thirds of the @xmath6 band ( 1.471.7@xmath0 ) .",
    "the fbgs were manufactured by redfern optical components based on our design to suppress the 103 brightest oh doublets using the line positions and strengths from @xcite .",
    "the h1 fbg has notches in the first portion of the @xmath6 band ( 1.471.58@xmath0 ) and the h2 fbg has notches in the second portion ( 1.581.7@xmath0 ) .",
    "the fbgs are printed in a custom photosensitive smf ( nufern cms8 ) .",
    "fbgs are highly sensitive to both strain and temperature variations , which induce wavelength shifts .",
    "the h1 and h2 fbgs are packaged in 304 stainless steel tubes designed to induce a strain in the fiber that varies with temperature in such a way that it cancels the intrinsic thermal wavelength shift of the fbgs , allowing the notches to remain aligned with the oh lines over the temperature range between -10 and + 25@xmath8c .",

    "the doublet mean is the same , but the fbg notch is not wide enough to suppress the doublet according to @xcite .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ fig : abrams ] for the 31 q1(4.5 ) transition , which shows the @xcite values in red and the @xcite values in blue .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    nevertheless , this is a clear demonstration that fbgs can cleanly remove oh lines while maintaining relatively high throughput between the lines .",
    "the integrated background in the range 1.51.7@xmath0 was reduced by a factor of @xmath18 , but there was no significant reduction in the interline background as predicted by @xcite .",
    "this is unexpected given that @xcite recently found that scattered oh dominates the interline background in their @xmath6-band spectrum .",
    "the blank sky observations made with gnosis thus far are detector noise - dominated in the interline regions .",
    "the faintness of the interline background and low system throughput of our current configuration requires 30 minute exposures for an interline background of @xmath110adu per pixel , which corresponds to @xmath145@xmath44 per pixel . of this , approximately 27@xmath44 per pixel are from the detector dark current and the other 18@xmath44 per pixel are from the sky .",
    "thus , the detector s 8@xmath44 per pixel read noise gives @xmath117% uncertainty in the interline background .",
    "thus , it is possible that our oh suppression fibers are reducing the interline background , but we were unable to observe the reduction of the low interline signal among the detector noise .",
    "alternatively , there may be no reduction because of physical sources , but it is impossible to tell without observations that are not detector noise - dominated .",
    "the sensitivity of gnosis was measured from an observation of a low surface brightness galaxy hizoa j0836 - 43 ( @xmath6-band surface brightness of 17.3magarcsec@xmath39 ) .",
    "the galaxy is larger than the gnosis fov and the unknown aperture losses were not an issue .",
    "the sky - subtracted spectrum was divided by the square root of the non - subtracted spectrum to obtain the signal to noise per pixel .",
    "the median signal to noise per pixel was @xmath110 for a 30 minute exposure . the same analysis on the spectrum through the control fiber yields the same result , surprisingly indicating that there was no improvement in signal to noise per pixel when using gnosis oh suppression .",
    "this is because oh suppression mainly improves the signal to noise near the oh lines . in between the lines ( the region that dominates the sensitivity calculation ) the reduction in the background was much smaller than expected",
    "in this paper , we have given a thorough description of each subsystem of gnosis , the first instrument to use fiber bragg grating oh suppression fibers .",
    "these fibers were designed to demonstrate a reduction of the interline background increasing sensitivity by a factor of 40 or more when suppressing the brightest oh doublets in the @xmath6-band .",
    "the line spread function of iris2 shows that the spectrograph s diffraction grating scatters light many pixels from the line center and simulations show that the cumulative contribution from multiple lines leads to a continuum of scattered light that dominates the interline background @xcite .",
    "if the emission lines are suppressed before the light has the opportunity to be scattered by the spectrograph , the continuum of scattered light and therefore the interline background will be reduced .     with the oh lines corresponding to @xmath48 transitions from @xcite shown by the dashed blue lines .",
    "these @xmath48 lines were not suppressed by design based on their relative strengths in @xcite but they match up well with the residual features in the spectrum.[fig : abramsr],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to demonstrate this effect , we carried out observations of blank sky with gnosis at the 3.9 m aat with the iris2 spectrograph .",
    "although the oh suppression fibers successfully suppressed most of the brightest oh doublets in the range 1.51.7@xmath0 at the target level or greater and reduced the integrated background by a factor of @xmath110 , the spectra showed no significant reduction in the interline background and thus the same median signal to noise per pixel when compared to a control fiber without oh suppression . a reduction in the interline background and the associated increase in sensitivity would led to oh suppression fibers having an impact on astronomy at the level of adaptive optics or greater . therefore , it is critically important to identify why no reduction was observed in these experiments and determine if improvements can be made to realize the full benefit of oh suppression .",
    "only observations that are detector noise - dominated have been made with oh suppression fibers .",
    "if no interline background reduction is seen in oh - suppressed observations that are not detector noise - dominated it would indicate either oh suppression fibers do not suppress scattered light or the atmosphere is more complex than modeled by @xcite .",
    "specifically , the oh spectrum may be different than the model of @xcite used to design the fbgs , which would result in poor suppression .",
    "we have presented evidence of this above and poorly suppressed lines such as these would scatter more light into the interline regions .",
    "alternatively , there may be unaccounted for atmospheric continuum sources from other molecular species that creates a continuum floor .",
    "it may also be possible that the unsuppressed oh lines are not as weak as indicated by @xcite and they scatter more light into the interline regions . as evidence , we found that the @xmath48 transitions found in @xcite match up well with residual features in our oh - suppressed spectrum of the sky as seen in figure [ fig : abramsr ] .",
    "these doublets according to @xcite are stronger than indicated by @xcite and would contribute more scattered light to the interline region .",
    "the evidence that inaccuracies in the fbg design because of inaccuracies in the oh line model of @xcite , which may result in more scattered light in the interline region than expected , is certainly suggestive . however , this is based on the assumption that oh suppression fibers suppress scattered light , which has yet to be demonstrated .",
    "thus , it is critically important that the next step be a clear demonstration of scattered light suppression with observations that are not detector noise - dominated .",
    "such observations require that the interline signal is greater and/or the detector noise is lower . in general , this may be accomplished by increasing the brightness of the source , increasing the throughput of the system and/or utilizing a low - noise detector",
    ". the system throughput may be increased mostly significantly by optimizing the oh suppression fibers and/or the spectrograph .",
    "presently , without first demonstrating that oh suppression fibers suppress scattered light , fabricating optimized fibers would be difficult to justify .",
    "thus , @xcite suggested that pairing gnosis with a fiber - fed spectrograph with a high efficiency volume phase holographic ( vph ) grating is the best way to go about improving system throughput . if a high - performance detector , a 1.7@xmath0 cutoff hawaii-2rg for example , were included the spectrograph would simultaneously increase throughput and lower detector noise , which would be ideal for oh - suppressed observations of blank sky .",
    "the australian astronomical observatory has plans to build such a spectrograph called praxis for further testing of oh suppression fibers on - sky by early 2014 @xcite .",
    "however , for the purpose of demonstrating scattered light suppression , observations of blank sky are not ideal because the sky spectrum may be considerably more complex than the spectrum the fbgs are designed to suppress .",
    "thus , the ideal source would be an oh line source in the laboratory , such as that created by @xcite .",
    "this would remove any complications from additional atmospheric sources , but the weaker suppressed oh lines are still present .",
    "alternatively , scattered light suppression may also be demonstrated with a single emission line from a bright arc lamp ( xenon has at least one line at 1.6733@xmath0 that coincides with one of the fbg notches ) .",
    "these observations only require gnosis and the iris2 spectrograph without any telescope , which is advantageous because they do not require building a new spectrograph .    regardless of whether or not oh suppression fibers can be used to reduce the interline background and increase sensitivity , they provide real benefits for observations at low resolving powers ( 500@xmath493000 ) , which was shown by @xcite using observations of [ ] emission lines in seyfert galaxies and ch@xmath50 absorption in brown dwarfs .",
    "previously , observations at these resolving powers have been too low to resolve out the oh lines , but that is no longer necessary with oh suppression fibers .",
    "the performance of the oh suppression fibers is very good , but there is room for improvement especially the throughput .",
    "the biggest single loss in the oh suppression fibers comes from mm to sm conversion of the input photonic lantern .",
    "the beam feeding the delivery fiber of the input photonic lanterns is @xmath1@xmath32/5 and we argued in section [ section : photoniclantern ] that the oh suppression fibers must be fed at @xmath35 @xmath32/7 to avoid overfilling the mm port ( @xmath32/5.8 ) of the 1@xmath2419 photonic lanterns .",
    "thus , the mm to sm conversion throughput will increase if we slow the beam feeding the oh suppression fiber from @xmath32/5 to @xmath32/7 . for a back - to - back system with 1@xmath2419 photonic lanterns , the total throughput increases by @xmath10.5db ( 11% ) when slowing the input beam from @xmath32/5 to @xmath32/7 @xcite .",
    "however , doing so will decrease the fiber s fov . by conservation of tendue ,",
    "the product of the fiber fov on - sky and the telescope diameter is proportional to the product of the fiber input na and the fiber core diameter .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to underfill the photonic lantern mm port by reducing the core diameter or input na without sacrificing the fiber s fov .    as an alternative to slowing the input beam from @xmath32/5 to @xmath32/7 to avoid overfilling the mm port",
    ", we may increase the mm port na to match the input @xmath32/5 beam .",
    "if we keep the core diameter fixed , this corresponds to increasing @xmath25 , the number of smfs in the photonic lantern . based on equation ( [ equation : lanternna ] ) an mm port na of 0.12 ( the @xmath32/5 beam arrives at the mm port at @xmath32/4.2 due to frd ) with @xmath30 corresponds to @xmath51 .",
    "thus , a back - to - back system with 1@xmath2437 photonic lanterns fed at f/5 would be equivalent to a system with 1@xmath2419 photonic lanterns fed at @xmath32/7 and should yield a similar increase in throughput over the current configuration .",
    "the wavelength - dependent loss of a symmetric photonic lantern system may be addressed by designing the mm port of the input and output photonic lanterns to have different nas .",
    "if @xmath25 is the number of smfs then the mm port of the input photonic lantern should be designed to support @xmath52 modes at the blue end of the suppression range .",
    "as @xmath53 there will be @xmath54 modes at the red end of the suppression range and no penalty will be incurred in the mm to sm conversion at any wavelength .",
    "the mm port of the output photonic lantern should be designed to support @xmath55 modes at the red end of the suppression range , which would correspond to @xmath56 modes at the blue end of the suppression range .",
    "thus , in the sm to mm conversion , none of the modes will be lost at any wavelength .",
    "photonic lanterns with large @xmath25 are very cumbersome to handle and the gnosis grating unit is rather bulky and heavy ( 100 kg ) .",
    "a significant reduction in size and weight may be possible with oh suppression fibers consisting of fbgs printed in multi - core fibers ( mcfs ) with each end tapered down into an mmf .",
    "@xcite demonstrated such a device with an mcf containing @xmath1120 cores within a 230@xmath0 cladding and a single notch .",
    "mcfs with 37 cores can be manufactured and it should be a simple matter to taper down each end of the mcf into a 50@xmath0 mmf following a similar process for the manufacturing of the photonic lanterns .",
    "in addition to the reduction in size and weight no splices would be required boosting the throughput by @xmath10.35db ( 8% ) .",
    "assuming complex refractive index modulations can be imprinted into each mcf core with the same level of performance as the current gnosis fbgs and incorporating all the suggestions above would result in a throughput of at least @xmath10.73 .",
    "these next - generation oh suppression fibers are currently under development @xcite .    thus far we have discussed improvements to the oh suppression fibers themselves but the other subsystems also require optimization .",
    "retrofitting gnosis to the existing iris2 spectrograph was acceptable for an initial demonstration of oh suppression fibers , but a fiber - fed spectrograph like praxis would be ideal for future science observations . in the current configuration ,",
    "the instrument thermal background is high ( see figure [ fig : cold ] ) and emanates almost entirely from the slit block of the iris2 interface unit reducing the sensitivity of observations .",
    "a spectrograph with a vacuum feed - through would make the iris2 interface unit unnecessary and significantly reduce the thermal background .",
    "also , it would reduce the number of optical surfaces and there would be no slit block alignment errors , which would increase the system throughput by @xmath115% in addition to the increase in throughput due to the high efficiency vph grating and the increase in sensitivity due to the high performance detector .",
    "oh suppression fibers have the potential to significantly expand our window to the universe from the ground if their suppression of scattered light can be confirmed and the atmosphere does not contain bright continuum sources that are un - filterable .",
    "nevertheless , these fibers provide real benefits for spectroscopic observations at low resolving powers and optimized systems utilizing these types of fibers are very feasible .",
