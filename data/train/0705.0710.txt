    "the purpose of this article is to prove the following :    [ big ] if @xmath8 is the compact complex surface obtained from @xmath11 by blowing up two distinct points , then @xmath8 admits an einstein metric @xmath9 of positive ricci curvature which is hermitian with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "the complex surface figuring in this result is diffeomorphic to @xmath12 , and can also be obtained by blowing up @xmath13 at one point .",
    "this manifold has @xmath14 , in the sense that its first chern class is the khler class of a khler metric ; thus , it is an example of a del pezzo surface ",
    "i.e . a fano manifold of complex dimension @xmath15 . however , by a result of matsushima @xcite , it can not admit a khler - einstein metric , because its automorphism group is non - reductive .",
    "our strategy for proving theorem [ big ] was originally motivated by the work of derdziski @xcite on einstein metrics which are _ conformally _ khler . by extending derdziski s results ,",
    "the second author has shown elsewhere @xcite that if a hermitian metric @xmath9 on a compact complex surface @xmath16 is einstein , then @xmath9 is necessarily conformal to a khler metric @xmath17 , and that , unless @xmath9 is itself khler , then    * @xmath8 has @xmath18 , and is obtained from @xmath11 by blowing up @xmath19 , @xmath15 , or @xmath20 points in general position ; * @xmath9 has positive ricci curvature ; * @xmath17 is an extremal khler metric in the sense of calabi @xcite ; * the scalar curvature @xmath21 of @xmath17 is everywhere positive ; and * after appropriate normalization , @xmath22 .",
    "these observations conversely motivate the proof of theorem [ big ] , which proceeds by constructing an extremal khler metric @xmath17 with the property that @xmath22 is einstein .",
    "this is done by using a weak compactness result of the first and third authors to produce large deformations of certain extremal khler metrics constructed by arezzo , pacard and singer @xcite . for a concise summary of the proof , see  [ stratego ] below .",

    "theorem [ big ] exactly fills in the missing puzzle - piece needed to prove the following :    [ free ] let @xmath16 be a compact complex surface . then @xmath6 admits an einstein metric which is hermitian with respect to @xmath7 if and only if @xmath24\\ ] ] for some real constant @xmath5 and some khler class @xmath25 \\in h^2 ( m , \\rr)$ ] .",
    "theorem [ big ] also completes the solution of a slightly different problem .",
    "let us instead focus on the underlying @xmath26-manifold @xmath6 of a compact complex surface , and , without supposing anything about the relationship between the metric and complex structure , ask when this smooth manifold admits an einstein metric with positive @xmath5 . by the hitchin - thorpe inequality @xcite , the existence of such a metric implies that @xmath6 has @xmath27 .",
    "however , the latter ensures @xcite that the seiberg - witten invariant @xcite is well - defined , and the existence of a positive - scalar - curvature metric then forces the invariant to vanish .",
    "but since @xmath28 , the kodaira classification @xcite says that the complex surface @xmath6 is either rational or of general type .",
    "since the seiberg - witten invariant of @xmath6 would be non - zero if it were of general type , we therefore conclude that @xmath6 can obtained from either @xmath11 or a rational ruled surface by blowing up ; and since @xmath28 , we thus conclude that @xmath6 is diffeomorphic to either @xmath29 , @xmath30 , or to @xmath31 .",
    "similarly , one can reach this same conclusion if the assumption that @xmath6 admits a complex structure is replaced with the hypothesis that it admits a symplectic form @xcite . in conjunction with the results of tian - yau @xcite ,",
    "theorem [ big ] therefore implies the following :    let @xmath6 be a smooth compact oriented @xmath26-manifold which either admits a complex structure or admits a symplectic structure .",
    "then @xmath6 carries an einstein metric of positive scalar curvature if and only if it is orientedly diffeomorphic to either a connected sum @xmath29 , where @xmath30 , or else to @xmath31 .",
    "we now outline the proof of theorem [ big ] .",
    "arezzo , pacard , and singer @xcite have shown that if @xmath32 is blown up at a point , the resulting complex surface @xmath6    ( 240,80)(0,3 ) ( -7,70)(1,0)54 ( 40,75)(2,-3)28 ( 0,75)(-2,-3)28 ( 68,44)(-1,-1)52 ( -28,44)(1,-1)52 ( 20,77)(0,0)@xmath33 ( -21,13)(0,0)@xmath34 ( 60,13)(0,0)@xmath35 ( 100,40)(1,0)50 ( 210,0)(1,1)45 ( 220,0)(-1,1)45 ( 210,80)(1,-1)45 ( 220,80)(-1,-1)45 ( 215,75 )    admits extremal khler metrics ; in particular , their work shows that such metrics can be found in the khler classes @xmath36 for any sufficiently small @xmath37 , where @xmath33 is the poincar dual of the exceptional divisor introduced by blowing up , and where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the poincar duals of the factor @xmath38 s of @xmath32 .",
    "we note in passing that the homology classes @xmath39 and @xmath40 are also represented by @xmath41-curves , and that blowing these two exceptional divisors down    ( 240,80)(0,3 ) ( -7,70)(1,0)54 ( 40,75)(2,-3)28 ( 0,75)(-2,-3)28 ( 68,44)(-1,-1)52 ( -28,44)(1,-1)52 ( 20,77)(0,0)@xmath33 ( -21,13)(0,0)@xmath34 ( 60,13)(0,0)@xmath35 ( 100,40)(1,0)50 ( 210,0)(2,3)52 ( 220,0)(-2,3)52 ( 165,70)(1,0)100 ( 172.6,70.5 ) ( 257.4,70.5 )    results in @xmath11 ; thus @xmath6 may also be described as @xmath12 .",
    "we also note that the khler classes we are choosing to study are ones for which @xmath34 and @xmath35 have equal areas , even though the arezzo - pacard - singer result would also construct extremal khler metrics for which the ratios of these areas is quite arbitrary . by the uniqueness of extremal khler metrics in a given khler class @xcite",
    ", the metrics we are considering therefore not only have an isometric @xmath42-action , but also admit an additional isometric @xmath43 action which interchanges @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this leads to major technical simplifications which will play a crucial rle in our proof .",
    "we thus introduce the term _ bilaterally symmetric _ to describe both those khler classes which are invariant under the interchange @xmath44 , as well as the extremal khler metrics we will find in many such classes .    by a general result @xcite proved via the inverse - function theorem , the _ extremal cone _ , consisting of the khler classes of all extremal khler metrics on @xmath8 is automatically open in @xmath45 ; consequently , the set of @xmath46 for which the relevant khler class contains an extremal khler metric is open .",
    "as we increase @xmath46 , we can then use the futaki invariant to show that the value of the calabi functional @xmath47 on these extremal metrics initially decreases , but would eventually reach a minimum and then increase if we could simply take @xmath46 to be sufficiently large .",
    "if we can simply arrange for @xmath46 to achieve a value which extremizes @xmath48 , we show in  [ fugue ] that the corresponding extremal metric will then actually be conformally einstein .",
    "thus , the problem essentially boils down to showing that , within a certain range , the set of @xmath46 achieved by extremal khler metrics is actually closed as well as open .",
    "our method of showing this is based on an orbifold compactness result proved elsewhere by the first and third authors @xcite . in order to apply this",
    ", we must first prove a uniform estimate for the sobolev constant of the metrics involved ; this is done in  [ sobstory ] .",
    "next , we must show that orbifold singularities can not form in the limit .",
    "this is done by showing that curvature can never concentrate in too small a region , since , upon rescaling , this would result in an asymptotically locally flat manifold which , given the topological and symmetry conditions imposed by our situation , would ultimately require the concentration of more curvature than is actually available .",
    "if @xmath49 is an extremal khler metric on a compact complex surface , the calabi functional takes the value @xmath50)^2}{[\\omega ] ^2 } -{\\cal f}(\\xi , [ \\omega ] ) \\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the average value of the scalar curvature , @xmath52 denotes the futaki invariant , and @xmath53 is the extremal vector field of the class @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "it is crucial for our purposes that @xmath55 may be determined @xcite up to conjugation even without knowing that an extremal metric exists .",

    "this section will now begin with a discussion of the problem , first explored in @xcite , of finding a critical point of @xmath59 , considered as a function on the khler cone . to do this",
    ", we will use computations of the futaki invariant first given in @xcite for the blow - up of @xmath60 at @xmath61 points in general position .",
    "any extremal khler metric is invariant @xcite under a maximal compact subgroup of the identity component of the complex automorphism group , and since such subgroups are unique up to conjugation , we may simply choose one ; in the present case , this means that we may consider only metrics which are invariant under the @xmath15-torus @xmath62 of automorphisms of @xmath6 induced by @xmath63 , [ v_1:v_2 ] ) \\mapsto ( [ u_1:e^{i\\theta } u_2 ] , [ v_1:e^{i\\phi } v_2 ] ) ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is thought of as the blow - up of @xmath32 at @xmath64 , [ 0:1])$ ] .",

    "since @xmath6 is compact , we may assume that these points converge to a point @xmath517 in @xmath6 ; similarly , by again passing to a subsequence , we may also assume that the images of the orthogonal subspaces @xmath518 converge to give an orthogonal decomposition of @xmath519 .",
    "once this is done , we then obtain a limit isometric action of the @xmath15-torus on @xmath203 by pushing forward the corresponding rotations of @xmath519 and conjugating with the exponential map of @xmath17 .",
    "since the push - forwards @xmath520 converge to a complex structure @xmath521 which is parallel with respect to @xmath17 , we moreover conclude that this limit torus action is holomorphic with respect to @xmath521 .",
    "now each of the holomorphic curves @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath33 in @xmath12 is the fixed point set of the isometric action of some circle in the @xmath15-torus , so each is totally geodesic with respect to the @xmath215 . by looking at the corresponding fixed point sets of the limiting action of circle subgroups , we can therefore find totally geodesic @xmath15-spheres in @xmath203 which are the limits of the images of these submanifolds .",
    "these limit @xmath15-spheres are moreover holomorphic curves with respect to @xmath521 , and have the same homological intersection numbers as the original curves @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath33 . by blowing down the image of @xmath33 and applying surface classification ,",
    "we thus conclude that @xmath522 is biholomorphic to the blow - up of @xmath13 at a point .",
    "moreover , since the areas of these totally geodesic @xmath15-spheres are the limits of the areas of the corresponding @xmath38 s with respect to the @xmath498 , the khler class of @xmath17 on @xmath523 must be the limit of the @xmath54_{i_j}$ ] .",

    "this shows that @xmath527 .",
    "thus @xmath511 is closed , and the result follows .",

    "it therefore follows that @xmath81_{x_0}= ( 1+x_0)(f_1+f_2)- x_0 e\\ ] ] is the khler class of an extremal khler metric @xmath17 .",
    "however , corollary [ suite ] then tells us that the conformally related metric @xmath22 is einstein , and defined on all of @xmath6 . we have therefore proved the existence of an einstein metric on @xmath12 which is conformally khler , and therefore hermitian , precisely as claimed by theorem [ big ] .",
    "while we have proved the existence of the einstein metrics promised by theorem [ big ] and its corollaries , we have not proved that such metrics are necessarily _ unique _ up to rescaling . on the other hand , in light of @xcite , this would follow @xcite if the critical points of @xmath59 could simply be shown to form a unique ray in the khler cone .",
    "extensive computer calculations by gideon maschler @xcite provide overwhelming evidence to this effect , and could arguably be called a `` computer - assisted proof '' of this assertion .",
    "nonetheless , it might be wiser to simply treat maschler s calculations as strong circumstantial evidence , rather than as a definitive proof . in any case",
    ", a conceptual proof more accessible to the human mind would be prerequisite to any claim that we really understand this phenomenon .",
    "one valiant attempt in this regard was made by simanca and stelling @xcite , who calculated the hessian of the functional and concluded that all critical points must be local minima ; but , contrary to what is tacitly assumed in their paper , this alone does not logically suffice to show that the critical ray is actually unique .",
    "we would therefore like to draw attention to this important gap in our knowledge , in the hope that some interested reader will be inspired to provide a definitive solution to the uniqueness problem .",
    "of course , the results of this paper also prove the existence of extremal khler metrics in a whole range of bilaterally symmetric khler classes on @xmath529 other than the ` target ' class @xmath93 used to construct our conformally khler einstein metric .",
    "for example , it is not difficult to show that @xmath530 actually lies in the interval @xmath508 of proposition [ freeze ] , and this implies that the first chern class @xmath531 is actually the khler class of an extremal khler metric .",
    "in fact , in light of theorem [ leap ] , it seems plausible to us that _ every _ bilaterally symmetric khler class might be represented by such a metric , but one would certainly need to consider many more possible bubbling modes as @xmath218 . nonetheless , since the results of arezzo - pacard - singer @xcite do imply the existence of such metrics for all sufficiently large @xmath98 , such a conjecture might seem quite tempting .",
    "of course , it would also be highly desirable to understand existence for khler classes which do not satisfy our convenient but somewhat arbitrary condition of bilateral symmetry .",
    "however , it is not hard to check that large regions of the khler cone of @xmath529 actually lie outside the controlled cone of  [ sobstory ] , so our method of controlling sobolev constants , leading to theorem [ leap ] , actually exploited the imposition of bilateral symmetry in an essential manner .",
    "the key rle of toric geometry in the present paper may make it seem curious that we have not consistently operated in the toric context throughout , rather than taking limits which are only then proved to be toric at the price of considerable extra effort .",
    "since donaldson @xcite has outlined a beautiful , systematic program for the study of toric extremal khler manifolds , we certainly wonder if some steps in our long argument could be simplified or eliminated altogether through the adoption of a different point of view !",
    "we would like to once again draw the reader s attention to the central rle played by ale scalar - flat khler surfaces in our proof .",
    "although there is a considerable literature @xcite concerning the construction of such metrics , it is apparent that too little is still known about their classification outside the hyper - khler realm so thoroughly mapped out by kronheimer @xcite . in general , this problem seems daunting , but in the toric case it might be feasible to prove that the only possibilities are the metrics constructed explicitly by calderbank and singer @xcite .",
    "a related problem would be to try to classify toric anti - self - dual orbifolds by extending the beautiful paper of fujiki @xcite .",
    "finally , we believe that it would be interesting to extend the techniques used in this paper to construct bach - flat khler metrics which are not globally conformally einstein .",
    "such metrics can certainly sometimes exist when @xmath445 fails to be positive ; for example , the study of extremal khler metrics on hirzebruch surfaces @xcite reveals that the differentiable manifold @xmath532 admits bach - flat conformal structures corresponding to many different critical values of the weyl action @xmath126 .",
    "it would be certainly be interesting to see if this same phenomenon occurs for many other complex surfaces .",
    "we hope that it may prove possible to use our present methods to construct such metrics on certain other surfaces with @xmath28 . in any case",
    ", the convergence of sequences of extremal khler metrics on complex surfaces seems destined to develop into a rich subject of broad interest , ultimately involving issues of algebro - geometric stability @xcite that have played no rle at all in our present story .",
