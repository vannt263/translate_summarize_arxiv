    "the light element beryllium ( be ) has very special origins .",
    "the primordial be abundance ( on the order of @xmath0 , @xcite ) is negligible as predicted by the standard big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "be can not be produced by nuclear fusion in the interiors of stars ; on the opposite , be will be destroyed by this process .",
    "it was first proposed by @xcite that be can be created by spallation reactions between galactic cosmic rays ( gcrs ) and the cno nuclei in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "this model predicts a quadratic relation between the abundances of be and o ( or a slope of 2 in logarithmic plane ) , assuming that the cno abundance is proportional to the cumulative number of type ii supernovae ( sneii ) and the cosmic ray flux is proportional to the instantaneous rate of sneii .",
    "however , recent observational results ( e.g. , @xcite ) showed a linear relation between be and o abundances , which indicates that be may be produced in a primary process instead of the standard secondary gcrs process .",
    "@xcite suggested that be can be produced in a reverse spallation of c and o nuclei onto protons and @xmath1-particles .",
    "this process will lead to a linear dependence of be on o abundances .",
    "the results from the latest big survey by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b99 ) showed that the slope of the be vs. o trend in logarithmic scale is about 1.5 , which makes the be production scenario more complicated and confusing .",
    "in addition , the exact slope of the be vs. o relationship depends on which oxygen indicator is used ( see discussion in sect .  [ oxygen ] ) .",
    "if be is produced in a primary process and the cosmic rays were transported globally across the early galaxy , be abundances should show a very small scatter at a given time .",
    "this makes the be abundance an ideal cosmic chronometer @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that be abundances in globular clusters ngc6397 and ngc6752 are very similar to that of the field stars with the same fe abundances . furthermore , the derived ages from be abundances based on the model of @xcite are in excellent agreement with the ages determined by main - sequence fitting .",
    "they suggested that be is produced in primary spallation of cosmic rays acting on a galactic scale , and therefore can be used as a cosmochronometer .",
    "however , b99 and @xcite found strong evidences for intrinsic spread of be abundances at a given metallicity , which may indicate that there is also local enrichment of be in the galaxy .",
    "but interestingly , @xcite found that stars belonging to the the accretion and dissipative populations ( see @xcite for the exact definitions for these two kinematical classes ) are neatly separated in the [ o / fe ] vs. @xmath2(be / h ) diagram , and especially , the accretion component shows a large scatter in the [ o / fe ] vs. @xmath2(be / h ) diagram .",
    "they proposed that most of the scatter in the be vs. fe ( o ) trend may be attributed to the intrinsic spread of fe and o abundances ( probably due to the inhomogeneous enrichment in fe and o of the protogalactic gas ) , rather than be .    in this work ,",
    "we present be abundances of 25 metal - poor stars , for most of which the be abundances are derived for the first time .",
    "oxygen abundances are also determined from both forbidden line and triplet lines to investigate the chemical evolution of be with o in the galaxy . in sect .",

    "the spectra were obtained during two observation runs : april 812 , 2000 and april 1012 , 2001 ( programme i d 65.l-0507 and 67.d-0439 ) , both with standard dichroic # 1 setting in the blue and red arms .",
    "the blue arm spectra ranged from 3050 to 3850 with a resolution of 48000 , while the red arm spectra ranged from 4800 to 6800 with a resolution of 55000 .",

    "it is well known that beryllium can be destroyed in stars by fusion reactions at a relatively low temperature ( about 3.5 million k ) . in order to avoid contamination of our sample from the effect of depletion process in stars",
    ", we also determined the @xmath3li abundances for our sample stars .",
    "because the destruction temperature for @xmath3li is lower than that of be , if @xmath3li is not depleted , be should not be depleted either .",
    "we adopted the oscillator strengths from the nist data base , namely @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the 6707.76 and 6707.91 lines , respectively .",
    "collisional broadening parameters describing van der waals interaction with hydrogen atoms were taken from @xcite ( see @xcite in detail ) .",
    "li abundances were derived by spectra synthesis in lte .",
    "results from @xcite and @xcite showed that non - lte effects for resonance lines are insignificant .",

    "the solid line is the best linear fitting ( not including hd106038 , hd97916 , hd132475 and hd126681 ) with a slope of 1.1 for our be vs. fe trend , while the dotted lines represents the best fitting for the b99 data.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    encouraged by the agreement of be abundances between our results and literatures , we now turn to investigate the chemical evolution of beryllium in the galaxy . as we have mentioned before",
    ", it is first necessary to investigate whether some of our stars are depleted in be .",
    "[ li_fe ] displays the @xmath3li abundances as a function of metallicity .",
    "we can see that six stars in our sample are obviously depleted in @xmath3li and another two seem to be slightly depleted , while the star hd106038 has an exceptionally high @xmath3li abundance , about 0.3dex higher than the spite plateau ( it also has an abnormally high be abundance , see discussion in sect .",
    "[ spec ] for this star ) . among those stars with depleted @xmath3li , only one ( hd97916 , denoted by filled inverse triangle in fig .",
    "[ be_fe ] and fig .",
    "[ be_o ] ) is also depleted seriously in be , while the rest ( denoted by filled squares in fig .",
    "[ be_fe ] and fig .",
    "[ be_o ] ) seem to have normal be abundances at their metallicities .    excluding hd106038 and hd97916 ( abnormally high be abundance and seriously depleted in be , respectively ; these two stars will not be included in the analysis of be vs. o trend either ) , the relation between be and fe abundances can be well represented by linear fitting @xmath7}-(10.24\\pm0.10)\\ ] ] one may note that hd132475 and hd126681 seem to deviate from the trend far beyond the uncertainties .",
    "if we exclude these two stars ( see discussion in sect .  [ spec ] ) , the relationship will be @xmath8}-(10.37\\pm0.10)\\ ] ] our result is in reasonable agreement with the result @xmath9}-(10.59\\pm0.03)$ ] of b99 , considering the relatively smaller metallicity range of our sample .",
    "the overall increase of be with fe suggests that be is enriched globally in the galaxy .    as the yields of be is believed to be correlated with cno nuclei directly , it s more meaningful to investigate the relationship between be and o abundances .",
    "due to the inconsistent oxygen abundances based on the forbidden and triplet lines in our study , it is necessary to investigate their relations with be abundance separately .",
    "[ be_o ] shows the trend of be with o abundances .",
    "again , the be abundances increase linearly with increasing [ o / h ] both for the forbidden line ( though with relatively large scatter partly due to the small sample number ) and triplet lines .",
    "the relationships are best represented by @xmath10}-(10.29\\pm0.15 ) & [ \\rmn{o}\\,\\rmn{\\scriptstyle{i } } ] \\\\",
    "\\log n\\rmn{(be / h)}=(1.36\\pm0.09)\\,\\rmn{[o / h]}-(10.69\\pm0.08 ) & \\rmn{o}\\,\\rmn{\\scriptstyle{i}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we exclude hd132475 and hd126681 , the relationships will be @xmath11}-(10.42\\pm0.15 ) & [ \\rmn{o}\\,\\rmn{\\scriptstyle{i } } ] \\\\",
    "\\log n\\rmn{(be / h)}=(1.30\\pm0.08)\\,\\rmn{[o / h]}-(10.81\\pm0.08 ) & \\rmn{o}\\,\\rmn{\\scriptstyle{i}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    our result based on triplet lines is slightly flatter than the result @xmath12}-(10.69\\pm0.04)$ ] of b99 .",
    "this can be partly due to our smaller [ fe / h ] range as mentioned above .",
    "besides , the o abundances of b99 were averaged from the uv oh and infrared triplet lines .",
    "they thought that such a result ( a slope of roughly 1.5 for be vs. o ) is neither consistent with the secondary process , nor the primary process .",
    "however , the secondary process added with some chemical evolution effects , such as an outflow of mass from the halo , indicates that there would be a quadratic relation only at the very lowest metallicities and a progressive shallowing of the slope to disc metallicities , for example a slope of 1.5 between @xmath13}=-2 $ ] and @xmath14 ( b99 ) .",
    "so they suggested that this process is most consistent with their results .",
    "as discussed above , forbidden line is the most reliable o abundance indicator for its insensitivity to the adopted stellar parameters as well as the non - lte effects .",
    "our oxygen abundances from 6300 line produces a ` moderate ' slope 1.49 for the be vs. o trend .",
    "however , @xcite studied the effects of 3d model atmospheres on the derived o abundance from forbidden lines .",
    "they found that o abundances based on will decrease if 3d models are applied .",
    "especially , the decreasing amplitude increases with decreasing metallicity ( see fig .  6 and table  6 of @xcite )",
    ". while 3d effects on doublet are negligible according to @xcite",
    "this means that the slope will be closer to one than our present result when the 3d effects were considered for the forbidden lines .",
    "this implies that the be production scenario is probably a primary process .",
    "hd106038 is very special for its exceptionally overabundance in li and be as mentioned before .",
    "its li abundance is 0.3dex higher than the li plateau , while its be abundance is about 1.2dex higher than that of normal stars with the same metallicity .",
    "the be abundance of this star is even similar to the solar meteoritic value .",
    "such a be - rich star is extremely rare .",
    "@xcite derived @xmath15 and @xcite reported a be abundance of @xmath16 for this star , both in good agreement with our results .",
    "in addition to li and be , @xcite showed that this star also has obviously enhanced abundances of si , ni , y , and ba . based on its special abundance pattern",
    ", @xcite suggested that hd106038 is most probably formed in the vicinity of a hypernova ( hne ) .",
    "in addition to hd106038 , another two stars , namely hd132475 and hd126681 , seem to stand out of the be vs. fe and be vs. o trends distinctly .",
    "their be abundances are about 0.6 and 0.5dex higher , respectively , than that of most stars with the same metallicities .",
    "@xcite also found an abnormally high be abundance for hd132475 ( 0.5dex above the normal stars at its metallicity ) .",
    "their sample included another star bd@xmath1723@xmath183912 , which has very similar atmospheric parameters as hd132475 but very different be abundance .",
    "in fact , bd@xmath1723@xmath183912 has a be abundance matching perfectly the linear be vs. fe relation",
    ". combined with another star hd94028 also with excess be abundance found by b99 , @xcite concluded that dispersion in be abundances does exist at a given metallicity , which implies a local enrichment of be in the galaxy .",
    "however , @xcite proposed that such dispersion could be mostly attributed to the scatter of fe and o abundances , rather than be , as we have mentioned in sect .  [ intro ] .",
    "following @xcite , we calculated the space velocities using the method presented by @xcite , and determined the orbital parameters based on the galactic mass model of @xcite for our sample stars .",
    "input parameters , such as radial velocities , parallaxes and proper motions were obtained from the simbad database . according to the criteria of @xcite , fifteen stars in our sample belong to the accretion component ,",
    "nine stars belong to the dissipative component and one star belongs to the thin disc .",
    "[ kin ] shows [ o / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] and [ o / fe ] vs. @xmath19 for our sample stars , based on the results from both forbidden line and triplet lines .",
    "one may find that no clear separation exists between the two components in the [ o / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] diagram , though the accretion component shows a relatively larger scatter than the dissipative component .",
    "however , in the [ o / fe ] vs. @xmath20 diagram , the two populations are distinctly different , and especially , the accretion component shows a much larger scatter compared to the dissipative component .",
    "our results agree well with the findings of @xcite .",
    "they proposed that such results support the idea that the formation of the two components took place under significantly different conditions : an inhomogeneous , rapidly evolving ` halo phase ' for the accretion component , and a more chemically homogeneous , slowly evolving ` thick disc phase ' for the dissipative component .",
    "the large scatter of the accretion component in the [ o / fe ] vs. @xmath20 diagram may reflect the inhomogeneous enrichment in oxygen and iron of the halo gas .",
    "we note that , for our be - rich stars , hd106038 and hd132475 belong to the accretion component , while hd126681 belongs to the dissipative component .",
    "another be - rich star hd94028 , first discovered by b99 and later confirmed by @xcite , is also classified as a dissipative component star according to the definitions of @xcite .",
    "while the deviation of the accretion component stars could be due to the inhomogeneous enrichment in fe and o of the halo gas , hd126681 and hd94028 can not be interpreted in this way .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that stellar kinematics is only of statistical meaning in describing the galactic populations .",
    "it has been shown by many previous work that substantial overlap exists between the halo and thick disc stars .",
    "therefore , it is dangerous to attribute an individual star to one stellar population and accordingly derive a firm conclusion .",
    "moreover , we did nt find any distinct differences in the abundance pattern between hd126681/hd94028 and typical halo stars .",
    "so the possibility that dispersion in be vs. fe and be vs. o trend originates from the inhomogeneous enrichment in fe and o of the protogalactic gas can not be excluded .    as an alternative ,",
    "the scatter in be can be interpreted by the so - called superbubble ( sb ) model ( @xcite ) .",
    "the basic idea of the sb model is that repeated sne occurring in an ob association can generate a superbubble , in which the cno nuclei ( ejected by sne ) mixed with some ambient , metal - poor material are accelerated onto the metal deficient material in the supershell and at the surface of the adjacent molecular cloud , and then broken into smaller atoms like li , be and b. the produced light elements are then mixed with other sne ejecta as well as the ambient , metal - poor gas .",
    "however , such a mixing can not be perfect , and new stars can form before all the massive stars explode or the induced light elements production occurs . as a result , scatter in the abundances of light elements for a given sb may occur @xcite .",
    "@xcite noted that na , mg , si , y , zr , and ba abundances of hd132475 are typically 0.2dex above the mean values of the other stars at that metallicity according to the results of @xcite .",
    "we also noted that y and ba abundances of hd126681 are roughly 0.2 and 0.15dex higher , respectively , than the mean values of the remaining sample as found by @xcite , and the @xmath1-elements of this star are in the upper range of their sample .",
    "na and @xmath1-elements are typical ejecta of sneii , and y , zr , and ba , though not very efficiently , can also be produced by the @xmath21-process in sneii .",
    "it is probably that stars like hd132475 and hd126681 were formed from the material that underwent enrichment of light elements and sneii ejecta but not plenty of dilution process in sbs .",
    "in addition , the sb model also predicts a primary process for the be production , which is consistent with our be vs. o trend .",
    "except for the possibilities stated above , some other scenarios for the overabundance of be can be excluded .",
    "it is unlikely that the be - rich stars were accreted from the satellite systems of our galaxy . @xcite and @xcite found that abundance patterns among the dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies stars are remarkably uniform .",
    "we note that @xmath1-elements and y abundances of the dsph stars are obviously lower than the be - rich stars .",
    "the possibility that the overabundance of be in our be - rich stars could be due to the accretion of a planet or planetesimals debris can also be excluded .",
    "if the excess be in our be - rich stars were accreted from some material having similar composition as chondrites meteorites , then the mass of the accreted iron would be even larger than the total mass of iron in the surface convective zone of the star , which is certainly impossible .",
    "we have derived be abundances for 25 main sequence and subgiant stars spanning the range @xmath22 @xmath23 [ fe / h ] @xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "relations between be and fe as well as be and o are investigated .",
    "the be vs. fe trend can be well represented by a linear relation with a slope of 1.1 .",
    "this result is in good agreement with that of b99 , and suggests that be is enriched globally in the galaxy , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "our be abundances increase linearly with increasing [ o / h ] based on both the 6300 and triplet lines , but with slightly different slopes .",
    "o abundances based on triplet gives a slope of 1.30 between [ be / h ] and [ o / h ] .",
    "this is a little flatter than the result of b99 , which may be partly due to different metallicity range .",
    "the most reliable o abundance indicator , forbidden line gives a steeper relationship ( a slope of 1.49 ) .",
    "however , this slope will decrease if 3d effects are took into account according to the results of @xcite , which means that the production process of be is probably a primary process .",
    "moreover , we find some strong evidences for the intrinsic dispersion of be abundances at a given metallicity .",
    "the special abundance pattern of hd106038 , especially its exceptionally high be abundance , can be interpreted most consistently only if the material which formed hd106038 was contaminated by the nucleosynthetic products of a hne @xcite .",
    "the deviations of hd132475 and hd126681 from the general be vs. fe and be vs. o trend can be interpreted by the sb model . however , the possibility that such dispersion originates from the inhomogeneous enrichment in fe and o of the protogalactic gas can not be excluded .",
