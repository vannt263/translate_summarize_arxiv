    "* sn 2005ay : * sn 2005ay was discovered , in the sc galaxy ngc 3938 , on march 27 by d. rich at magnitude 15.6 on ccd frames taken with a 0.31-m reflector @xcite . a spectrum obtained on march 29.98 ut with the calar alto 2.2-m telescope indicated a type - ii sn nature , taken soon after the explosion @xcite .",
    "fig.1 ( left ) displays the @xmath0 light curves of sn 2005ay .",
    "data of sn iip 1999gi @xcite are shown for comparison .",
    "we shifted the light curves of sn 1999gi along the x - axis to reach the best agreement at the stage of the steep decline after the plateau .",
    "after a clear plateau phase , the light curves show a rapid drop of about 2 mag , followed by a linear tail with an @xmath3band decline rate very close to the standard value of 0.01 mag / day , similar to the radioactive decay of @xmath2co .",
    "the main estimated data are : 1- explosion time : @xmath4march 23 , 2005 ( jd 2453453 ) , 2- total colour excess : @xmath5 , 3- distance modulus : 30.82 , based on the recession velocity of the host corrected for local group infall onto the virgo cluster as reported in the `` leda '' database .",
    "however we note here that the host galaxy ngc 3938 belongs to the @xmath6 group .",
    "the spiral galaxy ngc 3982 , which is also part of the group , has a cepheid calibrated distance modulus of 31.71 @xcite .",
    "if assuming the two galaxies have this same distance , then sn 2005ay would be intrinsically more luminous , which would increase the synthesized @xmath2ni mass by a factor of @xmath42.26 .",
    "+   + * sn 2005cs : * the discovery of sn 2005cs , in the sbc galaxy m51 , was reported by w. kloehr on june 28 at a magnitude of about 14 @xcite .",
    "modjaz et al .",
    "( 2005)@xcite reported the type ii nature of the events based on the spectrum obtained on june 30.23 ut with the f. l. whipple observatory 1.5-m telescope .",
    "nothing was visible at this location on earlier frames taken by w. kloehr on may 11 and 26 .",
    "the photometry data of sn 2005cs , spanning more than a one year observations , are shown in fig .",
    "1(right ) , together with the typical sn iip 1999em @xcite .",
    "the type iip nature of sn 2005cs is clear , with noticeable differences with sn 2005ay .",
    "the early magnitudes from amateurs , taken by different and independent obsevers , may suggest the presence of a narrow peak before the onset of the plateau in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands at jd 2453551 - 552 .",
    "the maximum light in @xmath9 band was reached on jd 2453553 with @xmath10 mag . in the @xmath7 band , sn 2005cs was brightest at a very early epoch , with @xmath11 .",
    "a similar behavior was observed for sn 1999em at the plateau stage , but the increase in brightness was more pronounced for sn 2005cs .",
    "the plateau stage lasted until about day jd 2453660 , and then the light curves display a steep decline with a drop of about 2.8 mag , then the exponential tail started . the main adopted data",
    "are : 1- explosion time : @xmath4june 27.3 , 2005 ( jd 2453548.8 ) , 2- total colour excess : @xmath12 @xcite , 3- distance modulus : @xmath13 @xcite    : @xmath14 light curves of sn 2005ay .",

    "+   + * the ejected @xmath2ni mass : *    the radioactive decay phase of sn 2005cs is clearly not well sampled , nevertheless the last two photometric points show a decline rate close to the @xmath2co decay .",
    "if we rely on these late data , adopting a @xmath2ni mass of 0.075 @xmath28 for sn 1987a @xcite , a direct shift of the light curve tail of sn 1987a to fit late two points indicates a synthesized amount of @xmath2ni of @xmath40.017 @xmath28 .",
    "the first 3 data of the radioactive tail may indicate an even lower @xmath2ni mass ( @xmath49 @xmath29 ) + the observed data of sn 2005ay , around day 230 after explosion , span about 8 days of observations .",
    "these late data are used as above to recover the @xmath2ni mass ( i.e. best fit with sn 1987a radioactive tail ) .",
    "this method leads to @xmath40.023 @xmath28 for the shorter distance and @xmath40.051 @xmath28 for the larger distance .    as a further check of the derived @xmath2ni masses",
    ", we make use of the well established correlation between the @xmath2ni mass and the absolute @xmath30 at the plateau phase @xcite . using our estimates of @xmath30 during the plateau phase ,",
    "i.e. @xmath30 @xmath31 -15.33 for sn 2005cs and @xmath30 @xmath31 -15.72 ; -16.61 for sn 2005ay , the method gives @xmath2ni masses of @xmath40.018 @xmath28 for sn 2005cs and @xmath40.026 @xmath28 for the shorter distance and @xmath40.065 @xmath28 for the larger distance for sn 2005ay .",
    "this indicates that at least sn 2005cs belongs to the faint tail of the luminosity function of type ii sne while the situation for sn 2005ay depends on the adopted distance .",
    "+   + * the progenitor characteristics : *        the type iip - analytical model of popov ( 1993)@xcite , and the hydrodynamic models of litvinova @xmath32 nadezhin ( 1985)@xcite are used to derive physical parameters ( @xmath33 ; @xmath34 and @xmath8 ) .",
    "the duration of the plateau ( @xmath35 ) , the absolute v - magnitude of the plateau ( @xmath36 ) and the photospheric velocity ( @xmath37 ) are the input parameters . + we evaluate the photospheric velocity at 50 days using the correlation : + @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "we use these estimates , and we adopt a range of @xmath39 days based on contraints by the early rise seen in both sn light curves . more precise constraints on @xmath35 should come from integrated bolometric light curves .",
    "the obvious declines seen in @xmath40 and @xmath9 bands would affect the resulting bolometric light curves , indicating shorter plateau than seen in v light curves .",
    "the results are summarized in table 1 .",
