    "transport properties of strongly correlated systems have attracted great theoretical and experimental interest for more than two decades . in particular , low - dimensional systems show significant deviations in transport properties from the usual fermi - liquid quasiparticle description .",
    "it has been revealed that electron correlation and topology play important roles in one - dimensional systems .",
    "recently , the study of transport properties in integrable models has been an active field of research .",
    "the two most studied models are the hubbard model and the spinless fermion(or , equivalently , spin-1/2 heisenberg chain ) model .",
    "several experiments  @xcite have observed persistent currents in mesoscopic metallic and semiconducting rings pierced by a magnetic flux .",
    "these studies have led to many theoretical investigations focusing on the interplay of electron - electron interaction and disorder in such systems .",
    "the persistent current in a ferromagnetic heisenberg ring has been studied in crown - shaped magnetic field  @xcite , which can also be driven by an inhomogeneous electric fields  @xcite due to the aharonov - casher effect  @xcite .",
    "based on a spin - wave approach , the spin current in an antiferromagnetic heisenberg ring with integer spin in an inhomogeneous magnetic field has been investigated very recently  @xcite .    in the first part of this paper we study the ground state persistent current of a spin-1/2 anisotropic heisenberg spin ring pierced by a flux . by solving bethe ansatz equations numerically",
    ", we find that the increasing anisotropy reduces the amplitude of the persistent current",
    ". this phenomenon has also been noticed by g.bouzerar  @xcite using the lanczos method .",
    "we also study the influence of an external magnetic field on the ground - state persistent current , and find that the increasing magnetic field reduces the amplitude of the persistent current .",
    "when the magnetic field is larger than a certain value ( @xmath0 for @xmath1 , when the spins are fully polarized ) , the persistent current vanishes .    quantum entanglement , as exemplified in the singlet state of two spin-1/2 particles @xmath2 , is a correlation between two quantum subsystems .",
    "it bears some resemblance to classical correlation , but differs in important aspects , highlighted by the observation of the violation of bell s inequalities in entanglement systems . for a special case of three binary quantum objects(three qubits ) , a quantitative extension of these inequalities has been proposed in terms of a measure of the entanglement called the  concurrence \" , which takes values between zero and one .",
    "several theoretical studies  @xcite have pointed out , for example , that the square of the concurrence between qubits a and b , plus the square of the concurrence between a and c , can not exceed unity  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , it has been found experimentally that entanglement is crucial to describe magnetic behavior in a quantum spin system  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we hope that the study of the entanglement in heisenberg models will enhance our understanding of the quantum features of magnetic systems",
    ".    we may regard a spin-1/2 chain as a collection of interacting qubits .",
    "this connection has motivated us to carry out the second part of the study to investigate the entanglement in anisotropic spin chains .",
    "there have already been several studies on the entanglement in spin chains  @xcite .",
    "in particular , recent efforts  @xcite have been made to understand the quantum entanglement in the ground states of some many - body models , in the hope that the study of entanglement can provide a new insight into the quantum phase transition  @xcite in these systems .",
    "motivated by a recent work about the entanglement generation in persistent current qubits  @xcite . to this end",
    ", we study the properties of the ground state concurrence and its connections with persistent current .",
    "our numerical results show that the concurrence is a periodic function of @xmath3 .",
    "the locations of the minimum concurrence correspond to those of the maximum persistent current where an energy level crossing occurs . in the presence of the external magnetic field ,",
    "the concurrence increases with the magnetic field , though the minima become less sharp as the magnetic field increases .",

    "the spinless fermionic operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 obey the anticommutation relations , and @xmath18 is the local number operator .",
    "it is well known that the ground state of this model has different phases : a metallic phase when @xmath19 and an insulating phase when @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the anisotropy , or interaction .",
    "the former phase is gapless while the latter gapful .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the flux can be gauged out of the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) , so that solving the schrdinger equation in the presence of a magnetic flux with a periodic boundary condition is equivalent to that in the absence of the flux but with a twisted periodic condition , namely , @xmath22 we emphasize that the characteristic length @xmath23 of the circumference is a mesoscopic scale so that inelastic scattering does not occur .",
    "this justifies the applicability of the bethe ansatz approach for the present problem , because the ansatz embodies nondiffractive scattering .    from the standard quantum inverse scattering methods ( qism )  @xcite , the diagonalization of hamiltonian eq .",
