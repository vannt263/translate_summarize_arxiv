    "there has been much recent activity devoted to the study of parton transverse momentum in high energy hadronic collisions .",
    "observables that are sensitive to parton transverse momentum can potentially provide new insight into the structure of hadrons .",
    "however , to interpret data it is important to understand the extent to which familiar perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) factorization approaches can be extended to situations that involve parton transverse momentum . in this paper , we specifically address recent efforts to apply the usual general framework of pqcd factorization ( with some modifications ) to describe parton transverse momentum in collisions between high energy hadrons with production of a pair of nearly back - to - back high transverse momentum hadrons or jets in the final state : @xmath0 the distribution of transverse momentum inside the colliding hadrons can be probed , for example , by measuring the small imbalance in the distribution of transverse momentum between the final state pair ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "parton transverse momentum also plays a central role in the generation of spin asymmetries .    for a discussion of the relevant issues",
    ", it will be important to first clearly define our terminology .",
    "very generally , a qcd factorization theorem  @xcite is said to be valid if an observable ( such as a cross section ) can be written as a convolution product of factors that describe different regions of parton momentum .",
    "schematically , one expects for process  ( [ eq : reaction ] ) : @xmath1 here , the symbol @xmath2 denotes all relevant convolution integrals and traces , and a sum over different types of partons and subprocesses is understood .",
    "the hard factor @xmath3 describes the short range behavior in the hard collision between partons , while @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) for initial state hadrons @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath9 are fragmentation functions for final state hadrons @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in general , a soft factor may also be needed , though we will not write it explicitly .",
    "the symbol `` p.s.c . ''",
    "indicates that power suppressed corrections are neglected .",
    "a _ transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) _ factorization theorem ( also called unintegrated factorization or @xmath12-factorization ) is said to be valid if the role of parton transverse momentum can be taken into account by using pdfs and ffs in eq .",
    "( [ eq : factorization ] ) which depend explicitly on parton transverse momentum . in a tmd - factorization formula , one therefore refers to tmd pdfs and tmd ffs ( or `` unintegrated '' pdfs and ffs ) .",
    "tmd - factorization should be contrasted with the more common _",
    "factorization theorems , applicable to cases where observables are not sensitive to intrinsic transverse parton momentum . in the collinear factorization theorems ,",
    "transverse momentum is integrated over inside the definitions of the standard pdfs and ffs .",
    "these are the standard `` integrated '' pdfs and ffs which are expressible as well - defined , process - independent operator matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "the process - independence means that the integrated pdfs and ffs can be parameterized by experimental data and then later reused in calculations to make first - principle predictions for future experiments .",
    "thus , this universality property of the standard integrated pdfs and ffs lends great predictive power to the standard pqcd approaches , and is a basic component of the standard collinear factorization theorems .",
    "it is natural to hope that an analogous universality property applies to the tmd pdfs and tmd ffs in a tmd - factorization formula . in that case",
    ", we would say that _ standard _ tmd - factorization is valid , where we will explicitly use the word `` standard '' to refer to the universality condition .",
    "if a standard tmd - factorization formula were valid for the process in  ( [ eq : reaction ] ) , then it would be possible to calculate cross sections using the same tmd pdfs and ffs that are parameterized in other processes like deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) or the drell - yan ( dy ) process .",
    "however , as we will discuss in more detail , tmd - factorization is not generally valid for the process in eq .",
    "( [ eq : reaction ] ) .",
    "the essential complication arises from longitudinally polarized gluons that couple soft and collinear subgraphs to the hard part and which , at first sight , appear to break topological factorization graph - by - graph at leading power .",
    "dealing with these `` extra '' gluons is one of the main issues that must be dealt with in all factorization proofs in pqcd . in dis , for example",
    ", it is found that after summing over all graphs ( and applying appropriate approximations ) , a ward identity argument allows the extra gluon contributions to be factored into contributions which correspond to wilson lines ( also called gauge links ) in the definitions of the pdfs or ffs  @xcite .",
    "however , in order to justify the approximations that allow an application of the ward identity , it is necessary to first perform certain contour deformations on the gluon momentum  @xcite . for dis",
    ", the contour deformations must be consistent with having extra gluon attachments between hadron spectators and a final state struck quark .",
    "similar steps apply to dy , but there the contour deformations should correspond to extra attachments between hadron spectators and an initial state quark .",
    "( see also ref .",
    "the result is that the wilson line for the quark tmd pdf in dis is future pointing while the wilson line for a quark tmd pdf in dy is past pointing  @xcite .",
    "the difference in wilson line direction has been shown to result in a sign flip for the sivers function ( a particular type of tmd pdf ) in dy as compared to dis  @xcite . strictly speaking ,",
    "this could be regarded as a breakdown of standard tmd - factorization because the sivers function is not truly universal in dis and dy . however , since a sign flip is easily accounted for , it is more appropriate to say that the sivers function in dis and dy possesses a type of `` modified '' universality .",
    "the relationship between correlation functions in dis and dy is further discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the problems that occur with tmd - factorization for eq .",
    "( [ eq : reaction ] ) are much more complicated because there one must deal with extra gluons that connect spectators to both initial and final state partons .",
    "the result is that the contour deformations necessary for a factorization proof prevent a direct application of the usual ward identity arguments .",
    "this problem was observed by bomhof , mulders and pijlman  @xcite who found that the wilson lines needed for gauge - invariant tmd pdfs and ffs in hadro - production of hadrons are not generally process - independent .",
    "although the extra gluon attachments eikonalize , the resulting sums of eikonal factors do not correspond to the simple future or past pointing wilson lines that are found in dis and dy . in",
    "@xcite it was shown at the level of a single extra gluon that the tmd pdfs and ffs ( assuming consistent definitions exist ) are non - universal because they require , at a minimum , process dependent wilson lines . hence , there is a violation of the universality property necessary for standard tmd - factorization .",
    "similar problems are encountered in proofs of collinear factorization for hadron - hadron scattering , but there one is saved by cancellations between graphs that occur _ after _ integration over transverse momentum ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and also more recent work in ref .",

    "what is missing is a treatment of non - abelian gluons radiated from different hadrons simultaneously .",
    "if a generalized tmd - factorization approach is possible , then extra gluons radiated from all hadrons simultaneously must be shown to eikonalize and factorize after a sum over graphs .",
    "given the complex color structures that arise in a non - abelian gauge theory , it is unclear that such a procedure is possible in real qcd .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show explicitly that even generalized tmd - factorization breaks down in a non - abelian gauge theory at the level of two extra gluons . in other words ,",

    "it is important to emphasize that the general conclusions of this paper do not depend on this specific model for the hard subprocess .",
    "what is important is that color is carried by both the initial and final state partons .",

    "so , the only contribution to a double sivers effect that violates standard tmd - factorization is from the sum of graphs in fig .",
    "[ fig : violating ] , and these are not accounted for in eq .",
    "( [ eq : modfact ] ) . to recover the factorization anomaly in the dsa",
    ", one would have to somehow allow each tmd pdf to have a non - vanishing factorization anomaly contribution at the level of one extra gluon .",
    "this , however , would contradict the single - extra - gluon treatment of the ssa in sect .  [",
    "sec : onegluon ] .",
    "therefore , a tmd - factorization formula can not be recovered by simply modifying the wilson lines in each tmd pdf separately .",
    "we have thus illustrated a specific example of a violation of generalized tmd - factorization .",
    "one can interpret the breakdown of generalized tmd - factorization visually by imagining the flow of color in the factorized expression , eq .",
    "( [ eq : modfact ] ) , as compared to the original unfactorized graph .",
    "the graph in fig .",
    "[ fig : violating]b , for example , must correspond to the product of two single - gluon contributions to the wilson lines in eq .",
    "( [ eq : modfact ] ) , if that formula is correct .",
    "the resulting color structure can be visualized as in fig .",
    "[ fig : color1 ] .",
    "the narrow double lines represent the wilson lines in each tmd pdf .",
    "the box shaped wilson lines represent the extra color - traced wilson loops in eq .",
    "( [ eq : modfact ] ) .",
    "the color trace over each of the wilson loops means that only a color singlet gluon can be exchanged between a wilson loop and a spectator at the single - gluon level , as illustrated by the factors representing the tmd pdfs in fig .",
    "[ fig : color1 ] .",
    "therefore , these contributions to the tmd pdfs must vanish .",
    "by contrast , in the original unfactorized graph , the interlaced color flow of the two gluons means there is no problem with exchanging non - singlet color , as illustrated by the color flow diagram in fig .  [",
    "fig : color2 ] .",
    "this corresponds to the non - zero color factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : colorfact ] ) .",
    "we have shown that a generalized tmd - factorization formula like eq .",
    "( [ eq : genfactor])/eq .",
    "( [ eq : modfact ] ) does not in general exist for back - to - back hadro - production of high-@xmath33 hadrons due to the non - trivial interplay of gluons that are collinear to both hadron directions .",
    "the failure of generalized tmd - factorization calls into question results that use it as a starting assumption .",
    "this includes calculations of weighted cross sections which retain a memory of the non - universality of the tmd pdfs .",
    "it is interesting to note that the same complications do not seem to arise if the gauge field is abelian . in that case , the abelian `` color factors '' can be identified with coupling constants , such as in the model from ref .",
    "then the contribution to a dsa from graphs like fig .",
    "[ fig : violating ] is indeed just a product of single gluon contributions to wilson loops from separate correlation functions ( which are non - zero in the abelian case ) .",
    "therefore , there is no obvious contradiction with generalized tmd - factorization for the abelian case , at least at the level of graphs discussed here . while a full proof of generalized tmd - factorization for the abelian gauge theory does not yet exist , the breakdown of generalized tmd - factorization that we have found is a specific consequence of the non - abelian nature of qcd .",
    "it is worth stressing that the failure of generalized tmd - factorization occurs in a regime where factorization would ordinarily be expected to apply ; namely for hard processes with large-@xmath33 .",
    "moreover , it should not be thought that the breakdown of generalized tmd - factorization is specific to a dsa or ssa .",
    "we have calculated for a dsa with color singlet boson exchange for the hard part in order to maximize the simplicity of the argument , but the reasons for the breakdown are quite general .",
    "the counter - example we have provided in this paper is sufficient to show that a general proof does not exist .",
    "that is , it is not possible to consistently define tmd pdfs for each hadron separately , even if we allow for process dependence in the wilson line structures . to encounter the same complications with generalized tmd - factorization in an unpolarized cross section",
    ", one needs the type of non - cancellation that was found in sect .",
    "[ sec : stanvio ] ( which comes from having two gluons collinear to one hadron ) , but with at least one more gluon collinear to the opposite hadron .",
    "an example of the type of graph which can produce a violation of generalized tmd - factorization in the unpolarized cross section is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : unpolgen ] .",
    "furthermore , the contribution from extra gluon attachments ( which lead to factorization breaking ) should not be thought of as negligible higher order corrections .",
    "they correspond to soft and collinear divergences in higher order hard scattering calculations . in real qcd , they are non - perturbative gluons in the strong coupling regime . for the perturbation series to have sensible convergence properties , it must be possible to rearrange terms such that the extra soft and collinear gluons are resummed to all orders into tmd pdfs .",
    "we also remark that , at the level of many extra gluons , there are more graphs with gluons collinear to both hadrons simultaneously ( which led to a breakdown of generalized tmd - factorization ) than graphs with gluons radiated from one hadron only .",
    "while the observation of generalized tmd factorization breaking leads to frustrating practical difficulties in cross section calculations , it should not necessarily be regarded as a purely negative result .",
    "the question of whether transverse momentum effects can be meaningfully associated with parton transverse momentum in separate parton correlation functions for each hadron is intrinsically important in the search for an improved fundamental understanding of qcd dynamics in hard collisions .",
    "a counter - proof implies the existence of effects which challenge normal partonic intuition , and suggests new avenues of research . while naive factorization fails , the fact that the extra gluons eikonalize suggests that wilson lines still may play a role .",
    "insight might be gained , for example , from methods currently being applied to small-@xmath89 physics ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "another possibility is to model factorization breaking effects by directly calculating factorization breaking phase contributions in perturbation theory , but with explicit infrared and collinear cutoffs .",
    "it is possible to understand the origin of the generalized tmd - factorization breakdown intuitively as arising from non - linear effects in the phases acquired by partons as they pass through the @xmath90 and @xmath91 fields of the colliding hadrons .",
    "if the overall phase were simply the product of the phases induced by the @xmath90 fields from hadron @xmath6 and the @xmath91 fields from hadron @xmath7 , then one could associate any process - dependent phases induced by the @xmath90 field in hadron @xmath6 with a modified wilson line for the tmd pdf of @xmath6 and , likewise , any process - dependent phases induced by the @xmath91 field from @xmath7 could be associated with a modified wilson line for the tmd pdf of @xmath7 .",
    "however , in the non - abelian theory the role of the @xmath91 gluons in @xmath7 is affected by the presence of the @xmath90 gluons from @xmath6 and visa - versa .",
    "a direct example of this is fig .",
    "[ fig : violating]/eq .",
    "( [ eq : breakingterm2 ] ) , where a single @xmath91 gluon exchanged between @xmath7 and the opposite - side struck quark gives a non - zero contribution , but only because there is simultaneously an @xmath90 gluon exchanged between @xmath6 and the other struck quark .",
    "this means that one can not address the role of phases induced by the @xmath90 and @xmath91 fields independently , but instead must deal with them simultaneously .",
    "the result is a kind of nonperturbative correlation which can not be identified as arising strictly from gluons coming from either hadron independently , but only from the combination .",
