    "is obtained by introducing an intermediate propagator for the meson ( a more fundamental , but at the same time more complicated technical approach would be to couple the photon to the @xmath4 structure of the meson ) . the transition matrix element for a general process",

    "the polarization of the vector meson has been denoted by @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 s ( @xmath30 s ) as usual denote spin ( isospin ) matrices .",
    "the superindex in the spin and isospin operators indicates the quark on which they act .",
    "the value chosen for @xmath35 is 2.82 gev@xmath36 @xcite , quite close to the one obtained from the study of the leptonic decay of @xmath37 in the quark model .",
    "if we assume the su(3 ) constraint , @xmath38 , the only free parameter is the ratio @xmath39 .      as a first application of expression ( [ metotalvmd ] )",
    "it is interesting to analyze the form factors of the nucleon for which we use the breit system of reference . to get the magnetic form factor",
    "we take a transverse polarization vector @xmath40 and compare expression ( [ metotalvmd ] ) with the corresponding matrix element in terms of the form factors of the nucleon .",
    "thus we get :    @xmath41 \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\langle \\chi_{b ' } \\left(\\frac{1}{2 } , - \\frac{1}{2}\\right ) | \\int d\\vec{p}_{\\xi_{1 } } \\ ; d\\vec{p}_{\\xi_{2 } } \\ ; \\psi_{b'}^*(\\vec{p}_{\\xi_{1}},\\vec{p}_{\\xi_{2 } } + \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3 } } \\vec{q}\\ , ) \\psi_{v}^*(-\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3 } } \\vec{p}_{\\xi_{2 } } - \\frac{\\vec{q}}{3 } ) \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\frac{1}{q } \\left [   - q \\sigma^{(3)}_{- } + p_{3_z } \\sigma^{(3)}_{- } - p_{3 - } \\sigma^{(3)}_{z } - p_{3 - } \\right ]   \\psi_{b}(\\vec{p}_{\\xi_{1}},\\vec{p}_{\\xi_{2 } } )          @xmath47 \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\langle \\chi_{b ' } | \\int d\\vec{p}_{\\xi_{1 } } \\ ; d\\vec{p}_{\\xi_{2 } } \\ ; \\psi_{b'}^*(\\vec{p}_{\\xi_{1}},\\vec{p}_{\\xi_{2 } } + \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3 } } \\vec{q}\\ , ) \\psi_{v}^*(-\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3 } } \\vec{p}_{\\xi_{2 } } - \\frac{\\vec{q}}{3 } ) \\nonumber \\\\   & & q \\left [ p_{3_z } - q + \\sigma^{(3)}_{+ } p_{3 - } - \\sigma^{(3)}_{- } p_{3 + } \\right ] \\psi_{b}(\\vec{p}_{\\xi_{1}},\\vec{p}_{\\xi_{2 } } )      symbolically @xmath48 .",
    "let us note that the factor @xmath49 multiplying the last bracket makes the electric form factor to vanish at @xmath50 , what can be interpreted as an indication that the total charge of the mesonic cloud ( @xmath19 , @xmath10 ) in the nucleon is zero .",
    "therefore , in order to get the baryon charge for @xmath51 , vmd can not be the only mechanism for the photon - baryon interaction .",
    "we propose instead an extended vector meson dominance model ( evmd ) as schematically pictured in fig .",
    "1 . the first diagram on the r.h.s . corresponds to vmd as calculated above .",
    "the second diagram on the r.h.s . corresponds to a direct coupling to the baryon for which we shall use a modified elementary emission model @xcite where a convergent @xmath52 instead of a @xmath53 expansion has been applied @xcite .",
    "quite similar assumptions underlie the so called two - phase models @xcite where the electromagnetic properties of the nucleon come from two sources , the vector meson cloud and the core of quarks respectively corresponding to the two diagrams we consider in fig .",
    "1 . hence we can summarize the evmd scenario in the equations :    @xmath54_{\\mbox { \\small eem } } } + { [ g_e^{p , n}(q^2)]_{\\mbox { \\small vmd } } } \\\\ g_m^{p ,",

    "the relative weight is 1 due to the charge conservation ( recall that @xmath58_{\\mbox { \\small vmd } } } = 0 $ ] ) .    to fix the two parameters @xmath59 and @xmath55",
    ", we can use the magnetic moment @xmath60 and the square mean radius of the proton ( @xmath61 ) for instance .",
    "one should be aware however that important contributions to @xmath61 , as the one from the darwin - foldy term @xmath62 , have not been considered .",
    "actually , a value of @xmath61 between 0.5 and 0.6 @xmath63 seems to be a better choice to get a very good fit of most electromagnetic transitions @xcite .    in order to extract some results we shall make use of two potential models @xmath64 , @xmath65 , extensively detailed elsewhere @xcite . for the sake of completeness we only quote here their expressions ( values of the parameters as in ref .",

    "one gets @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "then for the neutron we get @xmath71 ( -1.84 ) and @xmath72 ( -0.002 ) for @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the separate contributions from the two diagrams are shown in table 1 .",
    "let us emphasize that we do not do a completely consistent construction of the transition operator according to the mass operator .",
    "we assume that the wave functions we obtain by solving the schrdinger equation for @xmath64 of @xmath65 represent , through the effective parameters and interactions of the potential a sort of averaged @xmath52 quark core wave function .",
    "one should realize however that the corrections introduced by the @xmath52 expansion in the transition operator get correlated to the model wave functions through the weight parameter .",
    "it is ilustrative to draw the magnetic form factor .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "2 it is clear that the data lie between the predictions of the two models .",
    "this emphasizes the major role of the form of the transition operator ( as it was the case in the strong decays of the roper where the @xmath4 structure of the pion was essential ) leaving a fine tunning effect to the specific quark potential model employed .",
    "in particular , the @xmath3 structure is mostly responsible to get the tendency of experimental data .",
    "the roper transition amplitudes calculated in the evmd model are shown in figs . 3.a and 3.b .",
    "though a clarification of experimental data seems to be necessary , it is worth to emphasize that we reproduce the experimental sign of the transverse amplitude at @xmath73 ( contrary to what happens with an eem calculation ) for what the vmd as provided by the @xmath3 model becomes essential ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the smallness of the eem contribution is related to the use of a @xmath52 expansion instead of a @xmath53 one , combined with the presence of a node in the roper wave function ( note the higher sensitivity of this process as compared to the magnetic nucleon form factor case though the expression for the amplitude is similar ) .",
    "furthermore , we predict a change of sign at @xmath74 gev@xmath75 , a feature suggested by the present data .",
    "the behaviour of our amplitude resembles the one obtained with a light - front formalism @xcite , though we do not have a significant configuration mixing as it was the case in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in order to have a deeper understanding of the nature of the roper a test based on the calculation of the longitudinal amplitudes was proposed @xcite . in figs . 3.c and",
    "3.d we show our results for @xmath76 .",
    "the interpretation of experimental points @xcite in terms of the longitudinal amplitude is controversial ( see for instance refs . @xcite and @xcite ) about the sign of this amplitude .",
    "then no definitive conclusion shoud be extracted before more confident data are available and agreement about its interpretation is reached .",
    "meantime we may conclude that a @xmath2 structure of the roper can not be discarded once the transition operator incorporates the physically relevant ingredients .",
    "the resulting picture of the roper is that of a small quark core dressed by a mesonic cloud of total charge zero .",
    "the contribution of the cloud to the baryon masses can be taken into account quite approximately , through the values of the effective parameters or the potential , in a @xmath2 state .",
    "for the transitions , the cloud contribution has to be considered explicitely ( as an explicit @xmath77 component or in the transition operator as we have done ) .",
    "no exotic explanation of the roper nature seems to be needed , reinforcing the similar conclusions obtained in different frameworks @xcite .",
    "the analysis can be extended to other resonances @xcite .",
    "in particular , for the @xmath78 , the roper of the @xmath79 , the @xmath80 behaviour of the amplitude is depicted in fig .",
    "4 , showing a much more pronounced quark model dependence . in our model",
    "it also corresponds to a radial excitation so the comparison to data when available may be a more stringent test about our conclusions .",
