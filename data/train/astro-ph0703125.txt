    "at the very moment in 1936 that he introduced the concept of gravitational microlensing of one star by another closely aligned along its line of sight , einstein famously dismissed its practical significance . noting that the characteristic scale ( what we now call the `` einstein radius '' ) was extremely small , he concluded that `` there is no great chance of observing this phenomenon , even if dazzling by the light of the much nearer star is disregarded . ''",
    "it is easily shown that the optical depth to microlensing ( the probability that any given star lies projected within the einstein radius of another ) is only about @xmath3 among the @xmath4 stars that were typically cataloged in einstein s day . as there are only a few million such stars altogether , the probability that any of these are microlensed at any given time is much less than one @xcite .",
    "such a calculation may have influenced einstein to resist the determined efforts by hungarian engineer r.  w.  mandl to get einstein to publish his microlensing formulae and perhaps also to compose a letter to the editor of _ science _ to `` thank you for your cooperation with the little publication , which mister mandl squeezed out of me .",
    "it is of little value , but it makes the poor guy happy '' @xcite .    since einstein s 1936 article",
    ", several authors have attempted to resurrect the idea of microlensing ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , microlensing experiments did not actually get underway until the early 1990s @xcite .",
    "these experiments were motivated both by the suggestion of @xcite to simultaneously monitor millions of stars in the dense star fields of nearby galaxies and by contemporaneous advances in technology that made such experiments feasible .    to date , several thousand microlensing events have been discovered toward several lines of sight , including the large and small magellenic clouds @xcite , as well as m31 @xcite .",
    "however , the vast majority of events have been detected toward the galactic bulge @xcite or fields in the galactic plane relatively close to the bulge @xcite .",
    "the source stars of these events have generally been relatively faint , @xmath5 . in these cases ,",
    "the optical depth is of order @xmath6 , i.e.  @xmath7 times higher than for the local stars that einstein would have considered because the targets are about 10 times farther away .",
    "the larger distance makes the area of the einstein ring about 10 times bigger and increases the column density of potential lenses by another factor of 10 .    in the intervening years",
    "since the first microlensing events were discovered , a few authors have revisited the idea of detecting bright and/or nearby microlensing events .",
    "@xcite argued that microlensing events visible to the naked eye are exceedingly rare , occurring at a rate of one per 40,000 yr for lensing by known stars .",
    "microlensing of fainter stars is obviously more common ; the event rate for stars with @xmath8 is roughly one per year @xcite .",
    "this calculation led @xcite and @xcite to point out that only small - aperture instruments are required to discover these brightest microlensing events , and that monitoring the entire sky down to @xmath9 on relatively short timescales would soon be feasible .",
    "@xcite considered in detail a related idea of `` mesolensing '' : microlensing of background stars by nearly lenses with large angular einstein rings and large proper motions .",
    "mesolensing can be used to study the properties of nearby stars , and in particular their planetary companions @xcite . see  [ sec : disc ] for further discussion of the potential of microlensing to discover and study nearby planetary systems .    although , given the typical source distances of @xmath10 for microlensing searches toward the galactic bulge and the magellanic clouds , the majority of the microlenses giving rise to observed events have been located at distances of a kiloparsec or more , there is nevertheless a low - probability tail of more nearby microlenses @xcite . indeed , there is one event for which the lens has been robustly located to within a kiloparsec of the sun , macho - lmc-5 @xcite .",
    "another event , eros2-lmc-8 , is also likely due to a nearby microlens , although this has yet to be confirmed with follow - up observations ( j.p .",
    "beaulieu 2008 , private communication ; see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "thus , nearby lenses can be uncovered and studied in ongoing surveys .",
    "however , these surveys are not very efficient at discovering nearby microlenses ; furthermore , the source stars of these events are necessarily faint , making detailed monitoring and follow - up observations difficult .    here",
    "we report on a microlensing event of the type einstein believed would never be observed : a magnification @xmath11 event of the @xmath12 a - type star gsc 3656 - 1328 , located about 1 kpc from the sun in the disk of the milky way .",
    "although such events are indeed quite rare , microlensing of somewhat fainter nearby stars occurs with reasonable frequency .",
    "while this event was found serendipitously , we argue that with recent technological advances it is now feasible to monitor the sky to deliberately and routinely detect these `` domestic '' microlensing events .",
    "we propose a telescope design to accomplish this , and we argue that it is possible to build two copies of such a telescope that could monitor the majority of the sky down to @xmath13 at modest cost .",
    "monitoring of the discovered microlensing events would enable a novel method to detect nearby planets , allow a search for dark objects in the milky way disk , and permit several days advance warning for potentially hazardous asteroid impacts .",
    "@xcite also report on observations of the transient event in gsc 3656 - 1328 .",
    "a subset of the data presented here is in common with theirs ; however , the analyses were done completely independently .",
    "they also conclude that the brightening seen in gsc 3656 - 1328 is likely due to microlensing .",
    "on 2006 october 31 , a.  tago announced a sudden brightening in the close vicinity of gsc 3656 - 1328 @xcite , a @xmath14 a0v - a1v star . ]",
    "@xmath15 from the galactic plane in cassiopeia with a distance of @xmath0 .",
    "confirmation followed a few hours later in the variable - star newsgroups ; this established that the star was in fact the source of the brightening , and roughly measured the amount and timescale of the brightening ( to v=7.5 , rising in about a week ) .",
    "we began our photometry with the small telescopes of the center for backyard astrophysics ( cba : @xcite ) on november 1 ( = jd@xmath16=jd-2450000=4040 . ) , and found the star at @xmath17 , falling rapidly and smoothly , with no additional variability at the few percent level . in the next few days , we obtained time - series and multicolor photometry with cba telescopes , spectroscopy with the mdm 2.4 m telescope , and a pointed 5000 s x - ray observation with _ swift _ @xcite using the xrt @xcite ; we also searched for x - ray outbursts over the 10-yr lifetime of the all - sky monitor aboard _",
    "rxte_. the basic conclusion from all of these observations was simple : the star had brightened by 4 mag , but with no change in spectrum or color ( @xmath18 ) , no flickering , and no discernible x - ray signature ( with a _",
    "swift _ upper limit in the 0.5 - 10 kev band of @xmath19 ) .",
    "a search of 400 photographic plates during 1964 - 1994 showed no variability in the star @xcite , and we found no x - ray outbursts from this position .",
    "this seemed unlike any known type of intrinsic variable star , and several reports suggested instead that gsc 3656 - 1328 may have microlensed by an intervening passing star @xcite .",
    "after 2 weeks of data , our preliminary fit of the light curve to a microlens model ( see  [ sec : micro ] ) seemed promising .",
    "however , there were only a few very uncertain measurements ( with typical errors of @xmath20 mag ) before the peak , and identifying microlensing events based on falling - only light curves can be problematic @xcite . given the low _ a priori _ likelihood for such a nearby star to be microlensed , we eagerly sought additional data to confirm ( or refute ) the microlensing interpretation .",
    "in particular , we sought data before the apparent peak on october 31 , as well as data covering a wide baseline in wavelength , in order to ascertain whether the variation was both symmetric about the peak and achromatic , as would generally be expected for a short microlensing event of an isolated star .",
    "we were fortunate to find 15 images of the field in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 bands in the test runs of the northern ( hawaii ) station of the all - sky automated survey ( asas ; the southern station is described by @xcite ) .",
    "these images have errors of @xmath23 mag , cover ( athough sparsely ) the rise of the event , and fortuitously include one @xmath22-band measurement obtained almost exactly at the peak , judged by a microlensing fit to the remainder of the data set , as described below . since asas - north had just begun operation , this was mighty lucky .    as for wavelength coverage , we supplemented the cba monitoring with four epochs of uv observations ( on jd@xmath24 , 4055 , 4057 , and 4067 ) using the uvot camera on _ swift _ @xcite , and a long program of infrared monitoring from the peters automated infrared imaging telescope ( pairitel , @xcite ) on mount hopkins .",
    "pairitel is a 1.3 m telescope equipped with the former 2mass @xcite camera that simultaneously images the near infrared @xmath25 bands .",
    "we obtained @xmath26 7.8 s images in each band nearly every night from program start ( jd@xmath27 ) until the event returned to baseline .",
    "since the variations were smooth , we binned the images into 51 separate epochs , and the magnitude of the source at each epoch was determined using differential aperture photometry against a set of reference stars from the 2mass catalog .",
    "the _ swift _ uv data from this bright source were strongly affected by coincidence losses , and to minimize these we used only the m2 band ( centered on 2400 ) and estimated the flux of the source by summing in an annulus centered on the source , with an inner radius of @xmath28 and an outer radius of @xmath29 .",
    "we also obtained seven optical spectra using the ccds instrument on the mdm 2.4 m telescope on kitt peak , two near jd@xmath30 , three near @xmath31 , and two near @xmath32 .",
    "the spectra cover @xmath33 , with a resolution of @xmath34  fwhm , as measured from arc - lamp lines .",
    "they reveal an unremarkable early a star , showing prominent resolved ( fwhm@xmath35 ) balmer lines .",
    "we measured the equivalent widths ( ews ) of h@xmath36 , h@xmath37 , and h@xmath38 in each spectrum by integrating over a window of @xmath39 , fitting a third - order polynomial to estimate the local continuum .",
    "we estimated the uncertainties in the ew measurements by generating a series of mock spectra with identical noise properties , and measuring the ews in these spectra in the same manner as the actual data .",
    "see figure [ fig : ew ] .",
    "figure [ fig : lcurve ] shows the collected uv , optical , and near - ir photometry of gsc 3656 - 1328 during the transient variability . for all of these data except those from the cba , the photometric uncertainties are due to the photon noise from the source and comparison stars . in the case of the cba data sets , we estimated the uncertainties to be equal to the rms variability about a linear fit to the time - series data on the first night ( jd@xmath40 ) .",
    "we align all of the bands to the cba @xmath21-band by subtracting a constant magnitude offset , except for the asas data , which due to the larger point - spread function ( psf ) and photometric aperture include an additional contribution from unresolved neighboring stars . in this case",
    ", we remove this unresolved ( `` blended '' ) light using the microlensing model fit , as described below .",
    "the baseline magnitude of the microlensing source determined in this way is consistent with that measured directly from higher resolution images . as is evident from figure [ fig : lcurve ] , the variability is essentially achromatic ( i.e.  the color of the event is constant ) over nearly a decade in wavelength .",
    "furthermore , although the sampling on the rising side of the event is sparse , the variability is apparently symmetric about the time of peak brightness near jd@xmath41 .",
    "our spectra show no evidence for any emission features , and are completely consistent with that of a normal a0v star .",
    "furthermore , there is no evidence for any change in the spectrum of the star between jd@xmath42 and @xmath43 , during which time the continuum flux decreased by a factor of @xmath44 .",
    "this can be quantified by the ew of the balmer lines , which were constant to within the measurement uncertainties ( typically @xmath45 ) during this period ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ew ] ) .",
    "reports of optical spectra taken by other groups , which span a broader range of epochs , apparently confirm this lack of spectral evolution @xcite .",
    "the target - of - opportunity observation by the _ swift",
    "_ satellite showed no detectable x - ray emission , as would be expected from outbursting variables .",
    "these characteristics of the variability in gsc 3656 - 1328 , namely the precise light curve shape including the apparent symmetry about the peak , achromaticity , and lack of emission features or changes in the absorption features , are expected for microlensing but would be very unusual for outbursting variable stars , which generally change temperature ( and therefore color ) during explosive outbursts . essentially , what is required to reproduce the type of variability seen in gsc 3656 - 1328 is for the angular size of the star to change by a factor of @xmath46 while the temperature remains constant to @xmath47 .",
    "the only way for this to occur is for the apparent area of the star to change , as occurs in a microlensing event .",
    "occultation of the star due to , e.g. , an eclipsing binary companion can also make such a change in the apparent area , but obviously in this case one would expect a dimming , not the brightening that is observed here .    when microlensing surveys were first being planned , a major concern was the potential contamination from intrinsic stellar variability . as a result ,",
    "a number of studies addressed the question of whether there exists a class of variable stars whose variability might be misinterpreted as microlensing .",
    "at least two types of potential contaminants were identified .",
    "`` blue bumpers '' are blue main - sequence stars whose fluxes remain constant for long periods of time , but occasionally undergo brightenings ( `` bumps '' ) that are approximately symmetric about the peak , and have durations that are consistent with the expectations for microlensing events @xcite .",
    "however , closer inspection reveals that these variables have properties that can be used to exclude them as the explanation for the variability seen in gsc 3656 - 1328 .",
    "first , many or perhaps all of these variables are be - type stars , exhibiting balmer line emission @xcite .",
    "second , the brightenings are exclusively low amplitude , with peak brightenings of less than 1.5 times the baseline flux @xcite . finally , detailed light curves typically show slight asymmetries @xcite .",
    "at least some dwarf nova ( dn ) outbursts are characterized by approximately symmetric brightenings with amplitudes and durations that are consistent with that seen in gsc 3656 - 132 @xcite . however , it is unlikely that the gsc 3656 - 132 variability is due to a dn outburst .",
    "first , spectra of dns typically exhibit h or he emission @xcite .",
    "second , while the light curves of novae have properties that are grossly similar to microlensing events , they do not follow the standard @xcite form at the @xmath48 level with which the gsc 3656 - 1328 variability has been measured ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the interval between outbursts of dns is known to be directly related to the strength of the outburst , such that larger outbursts generally have longer intervals between outbursts @xcite .",
    "dn outbursts with amplitudes similar to the brightening seen in gsc 3656 - 132 would be expected to have average recurrence times of tens to hundreds of days @xcite .",
    "it seems unlikely that the kinds of observations that originally discovered the variability discussed here ( e.g. , @xcite ) would have missed previous outbursts ; furthermore , there is no evidence for such outbursts in the photographic plate observations taken during 1964 - 1994 @xcite .",
    "regardless , continued monitoring of gsc 3656 - 1328 would certainly allow one to rule out the dn hypothesis definitively .",
    "it is interesting to note that the source stars of the first two eros microlensing event candidates @xcite are both early - type main - sequence stars .",
    "spectroscopic observations showed that the source of eros - lmc-1 is a be star with balmer emission lines , whereas the source of eros - lmc-2 is a seemingly normal a0 main - sequence star with no apparent emission lines @xcite .",
    "however , eros - lmc-2 also exhibits periodic variability with an amplitude of @xmath49 mag and a period of @xmath50 days , indicative of an eclipsing binary @xcite . in both cases , continued photometric monitoring of the source stars revealed additional brightenings many years later , with amplitudes and timescales similar to those of the original events @xcite , thus excluding the microlensing interpretation of the variability .",
    "given the evidence in favor of microlensing , we first test whether the uv , optical , and ir data can be acceptably fit to a simple microlensing model .",
    "this model has as parameters the einstein timescale @xmath51 , the impact parameter ( closest source - lens approach in units of the angular einstein radius @xmath52 ) @xmath53 , and the time - of - maximum magnification @xmath54 .",
    "in addition , we fit for the baseline flux of the lensed source for each of the eight separate observatory / filter combinations .",
    "since we expect any light in the psf to be completely dominated by the bright source , we do not allow for any flux that is blended with the source but is not microlensed , with the exception of the asas data , which are known to contain light from unresolved stars in the photometric aperture .",
    "thus , this model has @xmath55 parameters .",
    "this best - fit model is shown in figure [ fig : lcurve ] .",
    "we find that the microlensing model provides a reasonable fit to the data : the @xmath56 for the individual data sets ranges from @xmath57 for 2802 data points for the cba @xmath21 data set to @xmath58 for 34 data points in the worst case of the _ swift _ uvm2 dataset . in the latter case ,",
    "the data may be somewhat compromised by the fact that the peak of the source psf was affected by coincidence losses in the first two exposures , although we attempted to circumvent this difficulty by using annular apertures .",
    "the remaining statistically significant deviations from @xmath56 of unity can be traced to large systematic outliers and well - known correlated systematic errors in the photometry . in addition , as we discuss in detail below , the pairitel data show some evidence for a small but non - zero component of blended light which may be due to the lens itself .",
    "we therefore conclude that the microlensing model provides a good representation of the data .    accepting the microlensing interpretation ,",
    "we then refit the microlensing model .",
    "we use an iterative procedure to remove large outliers from the cba data ( @xmath59 for cba @xmath21 and @xmath60 for cba clear ) and re - normalize the uncertainties in each data set by a constant factor to force @xmath61 , except for the uv data , for which we instead add a constant 0.03 mag uncertainty in quadrature . to provide limits on the magnitude of any contribution of light from the lens itself , we now allow for two parameters for each of the eight separate observatory / filter combinations : the flux of the lensed source and a free term for any flux that is blended with the source but is not microlensed .",
    "this model has @xmath62 parameters .",
    "we find @xmath63 days , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "this timescale is unexpectedly short ; for a typical lens velocity relative to the observer - source line of sight of @xmath66 , a lens mass of @xmath67 , and a lens distance of @xmath68 , one would expect @xmath69 .",
    "this implies that the lens is moving fast , is of low mass , is very close to the source or observer , or some combination of these .    in order to provide more quantitative constraints on the nature of the lens",
    ", we perform a bayesian analysis .",
    "we adopt priors for the parameters of microlensing events expected toward the gsc 3656 - 1328 line of sight generated from a galactic model which includes double exponential thin and thick disks , an exponential distribution of dust in the vertical direction , and a mass function of lenses including stars , brown dwarfs , and remnants . we include constraints derived from the measured proper motion of the source , as well as constraints from the analysis of the light curve .",
    "these latter constraints include the measurement of the timescale of the event , as well as limits on the angular size of the source in units of the einstein ring radius , and the flux of the lens .",
    "details of the bayesian analysis , including information about the model assumptions and parameters , as well as the observational constraints , are provided in appendix [ app : lens ] .",
    "figure [ fig : probs ] shows the bayesian probability densities for the properties of the lens star giving rise to the microlensing event seen in gsc 3656 - 1328 . shown",
    "are the results for the lens mass , distance , relative lens - source proper motion @xmath70 , einstein ring radius @xmath71 , and the @xmath72 magnitudes of the lens assuming it is a main - sequence star .",
    "the median and 68.3% confidence intervals are @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "there is an @xmath77 probability that the lens is a main - sequence star , an @xmath78 probability that the lens is a brown dwarf , and an @xmath79 probability that the lens is a white dwarf .",
    "the probability that the lens is a neutron star or black hole is negligible .",
    "the velocity of the lens relative to the observer - source line of sight is @xmath80 , indicating that it is probably a member of the thick disk .",
    "thus the most likely scenario for the lens is that it is a low - mass star or brown dwarf in the thick disk , with a mass near the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "the proper motion is likely to be quite high , with @xmath81 at the 95% confidence level .",
    "the apparent magnitudes of the lens , assuming it is a main sequence star , are @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , light from the lens may be directly detectable in a few years , when it has separated from the source , using high - resolution , near - infrared imaging .    given that the source is quite luminous , and the lens likely to be of relatively low mass , one would generally expect any blended light due to the microlens to be very small by comparison . indeed the measured blend flux values for the cba @xmath22 , cba @xmath21 , and _ swift _ m2 data sets are all consistent with zero and less than 2% of the source flux .",
    "for the asas @xmath22 and @xmath21 datasets , the blending is significant , but as discussed previously , the asas photometric aperture is known to contain light from nearby stars that are unresolved by asas but resolved by the cba data .",
    "surprisingly , we find evidence for significant blended light in the @xmath86 and @xmath87 bands , and marginal evidence in the @xmath88 band .",
    "specifically , we find blend magnitudes of @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 .",
    "the color and magnitude of this blended light are roughly consistent with that of a mid - to - late @xmath92 dwarf located @xmath93 away . although it is _ a priori _ unlikely that the lens would be sufficiently close that its light could be detectable against such a bright source , the short timescale of the event already argues for a somewhat more nearby lens , making the detection of blended light more plausible .",
    "indeed , as can be seen from figure [ fig : probs ] , even ignoring any potential constraints from the @xmath94 flux of the lens , there is a small but non - negligible probability for the flux from the lens to be as large as the measured blended light .",
    "if we assume that the blended light is indeed due to the lens , we can include this information in the bayesian analysis to provide much stronger constraints on the properties of the lens @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : probs_ir ] show the resulting probability densities .",
    "we find that the mass , distance , and proper motion are more tightly constrained , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 , whereas the constraints on the einstein ring radius are quite similar ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "the lens apparent magnitudes are @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 .",
    "we note that the median posterior value of the @xmath87 apparent magnitude differs substantially from the input constraint due to the strong prior that the lens be more distant and less massive , and hence fainter .",
    "if the blended light is real and indeed due to the lens , the lens must be fairly nearby and have a high proper motion ( @xmath103 at 95% confidence ) , and so should be resolved from the source in a few years .",
    "however , there are caveats . the ir data in this event ( as well as other data taken by pairitel )",
    "show evidence for low - level systematic errors at the few percent level that are correlated on the timescale of several days .",
    "furthermore , the early ir data were taken when the source was sufficiently bright that non - linearity may be important .",
    "either of these systematic effects could easily give rise to a spurious blending signal .",
    "regardless , the hypothesis that the lens is nearby should be testable in the near future with high - resolution ir imaging .",
    "a measurement of the lens proper motion and relative lens - source parallax , when combined with the timescale of the microlensing event , would allow for a measurement of the lens mass @xcite .",
    "the rate @xmath104 of microlensing events of a single source lying at a distance @xmath105 by a uniform population of perturbers of number density @xmath106 is @xcite @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the gravitational constant , @xmath109 is the mean square - root mass of the perturbers and @xmath110 is their mean velocity relative to the observer - source line of sight .",
    "adopting @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 , this yields @xmath115 .",
    "since there are of order 2 million stars in the tycho-2 catalog and noting that the source ( gsc 3656 - 1328 ) is near the brightness limit of this catalog , one would expect one microlensing event of a tycho-2 star every @xmath116 yr .",
    "this crude estimate is in rough agreement with the more detailed calculations of @xcite , who finds a rate of one event every @xmath117 yr for stars brighter than @xmath118 .",
    "thus , at first sight , the detection of a microlensing event with a source star with @xmath119 seems very plausible , given that amateur and professional observers have been combing the skies for comets for almost 40 years .",
    "however , it is unlikely that this microlensing event would have stimulated enough interest to generate the high quality follow - up observations that made a convincing case for microlensing if it had not been magnified by at least @xmath120 .",
    "such events are a factor @xmath121 less likely to occur .",
    "furthermore , the fraction of the event duration when the source is magnified by @xmath122 is also @xmath123 . taking these factors into account",
    ", we were probably lucky to observe such a microlensing event , but perhaps not unreasonably so .",
    "the above calculation and the more detailed study by @xcite show that the event rate for sources @xmath124kpc would be quite small , even with a more thorough and aggressive search procedure that detected essentially all lenses that come within 1 einstein radius ( @xmath125 ) of the source .",
    "however , if the search could be extended from 1 to 4 kpc , then the event rate would be increased by @xmath126 times , to roughly 8 per year .",
    "that is , we obtain @xmath127 from equation [ eqn : gamma ] and @xmath128 from the larger volume probed ( since viable targets are effectively confined to the two - dimensionsal structure of the galactic plane ) . such a survey would enable a probe of the matter distribution near the sun that was equally sensitive to dark and luminous objects ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it would also bring microlensing planet searches , which have been successful at detecting some novel planets against distant sources in the galactic bulge @xcite , nearer to home @xcite .    in order to provide an illustrative example of the planet discovery potential of such nearby microlensing events ,",
    "we determine what the sensitivity of this microlensing event to planetary companions would have been had it been discovered well before peak .",
    "specifically , we create a fake data set and then determine the planet detection sensitivity of this data set using the methods outlined in @xcite .",
    "we assume that before jd@xmath129 , the event was sampled at a rate of one point per day . for the time intervals of @xmath130jd@xmath131 and @xmath132jd@xmath133 , we assume one point every 30 minutes , and over the peak , @xmath134hjd@xmath135 , we assume one point per minute .",
    "we assume a photometric uncertainty of 0.4% for each data point .",
    "these assumptions are reasonable given the large number of amateur and professional northern telescopes that are available to follow these events , as well as the bright apparent magnitude of the event .",
    "we then determine the planet detection sensitivity of this simulated data for planet / star mass ratios of @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 .",
    "the finite size of the source will begin to suppress perturbations for mass ratios such that @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the angular size of the source @xmath143 in units of the angular einstein ring radius @xmath52 . the bayesian analysis presented in  [ sec : micro ] predicts a source size in units of the einstein ring radius of @xmath144 , and therefore we expect perturbations from mass ratios of @xmath145 to be suppressed by finite source effects .",
