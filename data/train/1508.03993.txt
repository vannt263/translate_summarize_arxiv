    "many engineering problems are governed by partial differential equations which can only be solved numerically .",
    "the prospect of parallelising such simulations in the time dimension have attracted attention by the scientific community @xcite , and the parareal algorithm @xcite is popular and widely studied .",
    "the parallelism in the time dimension can be achieved by leaving the distinction between time and space , in what is normally referred to as timespace methods .",
    "the technique is often used for solving hyperbolic problems with dicontinuous galerkin ( dg ) formulations @xcite , as demonstrated for the full four dimensional case in the context of rotor flows @xcite . for that application all the complications of a time varying geometry disappear , when switching to a timespace method .",
    "this advantage was also exploited for dynamic stall prediction as simulated with the navier - stokes equations @xcite .",
    "that work utilised spacetime adaptation and , as it is often the case , a compromise was made in the form of timeslabs , which allows for a tunable problem size @xcite .",
    "anisotropic mesh adaptation is an established technique for ensuring computational efficiency in the context of multiscale problems @xcite .",
    "there exists many heuristics methods for applying the technique to transient problems @xcite , but the only way to exploit the anisotropy in the physics as seen in timespace , is by using a timespace method .",
    "this is also a conceptually simple way to avoid the interpolation errors and heuristics associated with combining conventional timestepping algorithms with mesh adaptation .",
    "the benefits of anisotropic mesh adaptation generally increases with dimensionality due to the fact that elements can be stretched in more dimensions , and one could thus expect significant benefits from the use of a four dimensional anisotropic mesh adaptation algorithm , but ( to our knowledge ) anisotropic mesh adaptation has only been demonstrated for two and three dimensions .",
    "we are not aware of any studies involving the use of three dimensional anisotropic meshes for solving a timespace problem .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on a miscible viscous fingering problem , which is transient and has two spatial dimensions .",
    "the problem is known to exhibit chaotic behaviour @xcite , which causes some issues for the combination of a timespace method and anisotropic mesh adaptation .",
    "we attribute this to the fact that the numerical noise can grow in time .",
    "this could mean that a non - linear solver is unable to converge to the error level that one would expect for the computational resources utilised .",
    "we suggest to use the method of timeslabs , where the slab thickness is a kind of timestep size .",
    "the method is used to investigate the relation between the timeslab thickness , the computational resources used and growth of numerical errors .",
    "mesh adaptation is the art of choosing the discretisation that minimises the error level for a given computational cost .",
    "it is important to distinguish between p- and h - adaptation , which relate to the discretisation order and length scale , respectively .",
    "anisotropic mesh adaptation is the most general type of h - adaptation , because it not only considers the local element size , but also the element orientation .",
    "the optimal size and orientation can be expressed in terms of a metric tensor field @xcite , @xmath0 .",
    "this has units of inverse square length , and it can be used to map elements to metric space , where the optimal element has unit edge lengths .",
    "the metric that minimises the interpolation error @xcite of a variable with hessian , @xmath1 , is @xmath2\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2q+d } } { \\underline{\\underline{\\mathbf{\\mathrm{abs}}}}}({\\underline{\\underline{\\mathbf{h } } } } ) \\label{eqn : m } ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the number of dimensions , @xmath4 is the error norm to be minimised , @xmath5 is the determinant , @xmath6 is a scaling factor and @xmath7 takes the absolute value in the principal frame .",
    "the metrics of several variables can be combined with the inner ellipsoid method @xcite , illustrated for two dimensions in figure [ fig : ellipse ] .",
    "we use 1st order polynomials for all fields , so we compute the hessian by first performing a galerkin projection of the gradient onto 1st order polynomials and then repeating the process to get a nodal hessian . the nodal metric can then be calculated explicitly using equation ( [ eqn : m ] ) .",
    "we use the technique of local mesh modifications to adapt the mesh to the metric .",
    "there are four operation types : coarsening , swapping , refinement and smoothing , as shown in figure [ fig : meshmod ] .",
    "coarsening removes edges that are short in metric space without regard to mesh quality , but the other modifications only allow the worst local element quality to go up . the mesh quality is quantified by means of the vassilevski functional @xcite .",
    "we use an octave / matlab implementation , which is suboptimal in terms of performance , especially compared to a similar c++ implementation @xcite .",
    "we consider a simple two - phase miscible problem @xcite , where the viscosity , @xmath8 , depends exponentially on the saturation , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 corresponding to the low and high viscosity fluid , respectively .",
    "@xmath12 where @xmath13 determines the viscosity ratio . the velocity , @xmath14 , is given by the darcy equation , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the pressure and @xmath17 is the permeability .",
    "mass conservation leads to a poisson equation for the pressure , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the density .",
    "this drops out of the equations , because we choose to study the case of equal densities for the two fluids .",
    "the saturation is convected with the velocity given in equation ( [ eqn : darcy ] ) , @xmath20 the equation is treated as a convective equation with a three dimensional velocity vector , and it is stabilised with streamline upwind petrov / galerkin diffusion . the local characteristic length scale for the mesh",
    "is calculated by computing the steiner ellipsoid for every element and projecting this along the velocity direction .    the governing equations ( [ eqn : p ] ) and ( [ eqn : phi ] ) are solved with the boundary conditions illustrated in figure [ fig : setup ] . the use of a 13-sided polygon to approximate a circle avoids extrapolation , when comparing solution fields on different meshes .",
    "the perfect circular initial condition for the saturation makes the solution undefined , which causes the growth of numerical perturbations to become very obvious .",
    "all equations are solved with the finite element method using fenics @xcite , an open source finite element package .",
    "both pressure and saturation is discretised with first order polynomials .",
    "a direct solver ( lu ) is used for equations ( [ eqn : p ] ) and ( [ eqn : phi ] ) , while an iterative solver ( cg+ilu ) is used for galerkin projections .",
    "all computations are single threaded .     and",
    "@xmath11 are prescribed at the inlet.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we non - dimensionalise the equations with @xmath21 as characteristic pressure and @xmath22 as characteristic length scale , @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 are dimensionless space , time and pressure , respectively .",
    "@xmath27 is the simulation time .",
    "@xmath28 is a numerical parameter , which determines the relative resolution of space and time .",
    "we fix it at unity .",
    "another numerical parameters is the norm of the interpolation error to be minimised , and we go with the popular choice of @xmath29 for this .",
    "the saturation at the initial time is imposed by means of a dirichlet boundary condition .",
    "we initialize the non - linear solver with @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32    @xmath33 being the radial coordinate .",
    "we use a segregated fixed point method to deal with the non - linearity of the equations .",
    "the timespace problem is solved in slabs with a thickness of @xmath34 ( omitting the tilde ) , i.e.    * initialise mesh , and set @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "* solve equation ( [ eqn : p ] ) for the pressure with fixed saturation .",
    "* solve equation ( [ eqn : phi ] ) for the saturation by taking the viscosity to be constant using the previous saturation . *",
    "if it is the first iteration at this timeslab , go to # 1 .",
    "otherwise , we calculate metric fields associated with the pressure and the saturation .",
    "these are combined with the inner ellipsoid method ( see figure [ fig : ellipse ] ) , the mesh is updated and the fields are interpolated onto the new mesh .",
    "if it is not the first timeslab , the mesh is fixed at the boundary matching up to the previous timeslab , * if 20 iterations have been carried out with the current timeslab , we proceed to the next one by mirroring the mesh in a plane normal to the time direction , and set @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "we then go to # 1 .",
    "the mesh is changed in every iteration , and therefore the non - linear solver can not converge to machine precision .",
    "a typical timeslab is shown in figure [ fig : funky ] together with the result of a full timespace simulation .",
    "both figures illustrate the value of full timespace anisotropy .     and @xmath35 is plotted in terms of a wireframe of the final iteration with slab # 5 ( left ) and all slabs in terms of the @xmath36 isosurface ( right ) .",
    "the time dimension is from left to right pointing out of the plane .",
    "large elements clearly show up away from the interface , but even at the interface the anisotropy in timespace can be exploited such that very few elements are needed .",

    "figure [ fig : conv](a ) clearly shows that simulations become more accurate as @xmath34 is lowered , but the convergence is different when @xmath6 is decreased , at least in the last half of the simulations : the error seems to scale with @xmath6 , but it scales down to a certain level with @xmath34 . by comparing figure [ fig :",
    "conv](a ) and ( b ) , we can see that this is the level of the overall discretisation error .",
    "we attribute this effect to the fact that perturbations due to the mesh grow with time due to the non - linear nature of the problem .",
    "the extreme case of this is illustrated in figure [ fig : nconv ] , where snapshots of the @xmath39 contour is shown for three different iterations with @xmath40 .",
    "there are significant differences due to the growth of mesh perturbations , particularly between iteration 16 and 20 .",
    "this is to say , that the solution is not well defined and therefore it has an oscillatory component arising from the changing mesh .",
    "the error associated with this component increases with time , so it can be smaller than the overall discretisation error , if @xmath34 is sufficiently small .",
    "focusing on this case with @xmath37 and @xmath41 , it looks like @xmath35 is a good value .",

    "contour is plotted for a simulation with @xmath40 and @xmath37 for iteration numbers 16 , 18 and 20 .",
    "note how different the fingers between iteration 16 and 20 are .",
    "we expect the mean radial position of the contours to be well defined , but not the actual fingers ; they are determined by the mesh at the initial time , which changes at every iteration.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "the results show that it is possible to simulate chaotic phenomena with a timespace method .",
    "a cfl like condition still seems to exists , so the timeslab can not be too thick .",
    "this has to do with the fact that the chaotic nature of the problem allows for a range of solutions and the difference between these solutions , should not exceed the overall discretisation error .",
    "the lower limit for the timeslab thickness , is high enough to indicate that the total number of timesteps can be reduced by orders of magnitude compared to a conventional method .",
    "it would be interesting to compare an established method against an optimised timespace implementation in the context of large scale simulations and anisotropic mesh adaptation .",
