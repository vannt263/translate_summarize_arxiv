    "while the precise value of the hubble constant @xmath1 is still the subject of controversy ( cf .",
    "jacoby  1992 ) , the linearity of the redshift - distance relation is generally not questioned by most astronomers . since its original announcement by hubble ( 1929 ) ,",
    "observational evidence has mounted steadily in its favor ; for recent discussions , see lauer & postman ( 1992 ) , peebles ( 1993 ) , riess , press , & kirshner ( 1996 ) , and perlmutter ( 1996 ) .",
    "however , segal and collaborators have persistently argued for a quadratic redshift - distance relation wherein @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the redshift , @xmath4 is the distance , and @xmath5 ( segal 1993 , hereafter snwz ; segal & nicoll 1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "this relation is predicted for the low - redshift regime in the chronometric cosmology developed by segal ( 1976 ) .    the greatest difficulty both in establishing the hubble law and in measuring @xmath1 is determining the distances to astronomical objects ; this is often accomplished through the use of standard candles .",
    "the approach of segal and collaborators in effect is to use the entire luminosity function of galaxies as a standard candle .",
    "if one assumes that the luminosity function of galaxies is independent of position and local density , at least after averaging over solid angle in a large redshift survey , then the comparison of the derived luminosity function as a function of redshift in principle could be a test of the assumed redshift - distance relation .",
    "equivalently , the distribution of apparent magnitudes as a function of redshift in principle contains information about the redshift - distance relation ( but see petrosian 1993 and below ) .",
    "snwz choose to examine low - order statistics from the observed distribution of apparent magnitudes @xmath6 and redshifts @xmath3 in a given sample . in particular , they calculate the scatter in @xmath6 , and the slope of the regression of magnitude on log redshift , comparing the expected values ( under the assumption of various values of @xmath7 ) to what is actually observed . the distribution of apparent magnitudes or flux densities at a given redshift is independent of the density distribution of galaxies , and makes no assumption about the large - scale homogeneity of the universe .",
    "snwz have carried out this analysis using the 1.936  jy redshift survey of galaxies observed with the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( ) of strauss  ( 1990 ; 1992 ) .",
    "they found that @xmath8 ( the hubble law ) was strongly rejected by their analysis , with @xmath9 ( the lundmark ( 1925 ) law ) reproducing the observed magnitude - redshift correlations .    despite the importance of segal s claims over the years",
    ", there has been very little response in the literature to this work .",
    "soneira ( 1979 ) calculated the quantity @xmath10 for the galaxies in the _ reference catalogue of bright galaxies _",
    "( de vaucouleurs & de vaucouleurs 1964 ) and found that @xmath8 was greatly favored by the data .",
    "however , this analysis requires the assumption of a homogeneous galaxy distribution , unlike the analysis of snwz ( cf . ,",
    "nicoll & segal 1982 ) .",
    "a similar analysis has been carried out by shanks , as quoted in peebles ( 1993 ,  5 ) ; see also chooniewski ( 1995 ) . a more general discussion of the consequences of the quadratic redshift - distance law is given in salpeter & hoffman ( 1986 ) .",
    "finally , recent comparisons of observational data with the predictions of chronometric cosmology at high redshift ( which we do _ not _ address in this paper ) can be found in segal & nicoll ( 1986 ) , wright ( 1987 ; cf .",
    ", segal 1987 ) , cohen  ( 1988 ; cf . ,",
    "segal 1990 ) , efron & petrosian ( 1992 ) , and segal & nicoll ( 1996 ) .",
    "petrosian ( 1993 ) argues that given flux densities and redshifts for a complete sample , it is impossible to separate cosmological effects ( including evolution ) from the luminosity function ; one must make additional assumptions about underlying distributions .",
    "he therefore argues that one can not use the observed correlations between flux density and redshift as a test of cosmologies .",
    "the results of this paper are in accord with this ; we find that without additional assumptions about the underlying density field , the tests carried out by segal are only very weak discriminants of cosmological models .    in the present paper",
    ", we carry out an analysis similar to that of snwz , using data from a redshift survey of  galaxies .",
    "we discuss the derivation of the universal luminosity function in  2 . in  3.1 , we follow snwz in using the distribution of redshift and flux density as a function of redshift as a test of cosmological model . in",
    " 3.2 , we allow ourselves the assumption that the galaxy distribution is homogeneous on large scales , giving us a variety of further cosmological tests .",
    "we conclude in  4 .",
    "the luminosity function @xmath11 of galaxies is the distribution of galaxies as a function of luminosity : @xmath12 is the mean number of galaxies per unit volume , with luminosity between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we will convert from redshift to distance by writing @xmath15 , and arbitrarily adopt values of @xmath16 . with these conventions ,",
    "the luminosity @xmath13 of a galaxy is given by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the observed flux density at frequency @xmath19 .",
    "following the notation of yahil  ( 1991 ) we will find it useful to define the cumulative luminosity function @xmath20 : @xmath21 implying that @xmath22 the cumulative luminosity function is closely related to the selection function @xmath23 , which is the fraction of the luminosity function which enters the sample at a given redshift .",
    "for a sample that is flux - density - limited to @xmath24 , we have @xmath25 } \\over { \\psi [ l_{min}(z_s ) ] } } \\qquad , \\label{eq : selfunct}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the minimum luminosity detectable at redshift @xmath3 , and @xmath27 is a self - imposed lower limit on luminosity , corresponding to that of a galaxy at the flux density limit placed at @xmath28 .",
    "methods for deriving luminosity functions are reviewed by binggeli , sandage , & tammann ( 1988 ) and by strauss & willick ( 1995 ) , and can be classified as parametric or non - parametric .",
    "the former assume some implicit functional form for the luminosity function , characterized by a number of parameters which are adjusted to provide the best fit to the observational data .",
    "the latter make no assumptions as to the form of the luminosity function , and are constructed directly from the data .",
    "however , both approaches assume that the luminosity function is universal ; that is , independent of position or local density .",
    "this assumption of universality is of course a necessary one if we wish to use the observed luminosity distribution for cosmological tests ( although , as petrosian 1993 argues , and as we show below , it is not sufficient ) .    here",
    "we will derive the luminosity function by maximum - likelihood estimation , following nicoll & segal ( 1978 ; 1980 ) , sandage , tammann , & yahil ( 1979 ) , nicoll & segal ( 1983 ) , efstathiou , ellis , & peterson ( 1988 ) , and yahil  ( 1991 ) .",
    "if the luminosity function is universal , then the joint probability density that we have a galaxy of luminosity @xmath29 with redshift @xmath30 is a separable function of these two variables : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the local density of galaxies at redshift @xmath3 .",
    "the conditional probability density @xmath33 that the galaxy have luminosity @xmath29 , given its redshift @xmath30 , is then given by the joint probability , divided by the integral of the joint probability over all possible luminosities in the sample at that redshift , given the flux density limit .",
    "that is , @xmath34 note that the density field @xmath32 has dropped out of this equation .",
    "the quantity @xmath35 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lmin ] ) ; the @xmath7-dependence enters the analysis when calculating the luminosity of each galaxy from its redshift and flux density .",
    "we then maximize the likelihood of observing the entire sample : @xmath36 for computational convenience , we instead _ minimize _ the _ negative logarithm _ of the likelihood , where @xmath37 an attempt was made to include @xmath7 as one of the parameters with respect to which @xmath38 was maximized , but this proved impossible ; @xmath38 turns out to be a monotonically increasing function of @xmath7 .",
    "the maximum - likelihood approach does not depend on the assumption that galaxies are distributed uniformly , since @xmath32 dropped out of eq .",
    "( [ eq : indivlike ] ) .",
    "however , this requires that the mean spatial density of galaxies in the sample be calculated by other means .",
    "there is a variety of such density estimators available ( davis & huchra 1982 ) ; the one chosen here is @xmath39 = v^{-1 } \\sum_i { 1 \\over \\phi(z_i)}\\qquad , \\label{eq : n1}\\ ] ] where the sum is over all galaxies in the sample volume @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the value of the selection function at the redshift of the @xmath42 galaxy , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : selfunct ] ) .    the data set consists of 5313 pairs of 60 @xmath0 m  flux densities and redshifts above a flux density limit of 1.2  jy , taken from strauss  ( 1992 ) and fisher  ( 1995 ) .",
    "the recession velocities are corrected for the motion of the sun with respect to the barycenter of the local group following yahil , tammann , & sandage ( 1977 ) . of these galaxies ,",
    "4218 have redshifts in the range @xmath43 km s@xmath44 ; only these were used in fitting the luminosity function since the sample may be incomplete at much higher redshifts ( fisher 1992 ) , and at low redshifts the local motions are strongly affected by peculiar velocities that dominate the local hubble expansion .",
    "various parameterizations of the luminosity function are discussed by strauss ( 1989 ) and saunders  ( 1990 ) .",
    "we follow yahil  ( 1991 ) , in parameterizing the cumulative luminosity function by @xmath45 so that the differential luminosity function is given by @xmath46 and the minimization is performed with respect to the two dimensionless parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 and the characteristic luminosity @xmath49 , using the routine mrqmin from press  ( 1992 ) .",
    "the optimal values of the parameters for @xmath50 are tabulated in table  [ table : yahil123parms ] ; the case @xmath51 will be included in some of the tests we present for methodological perspective .    for graphical purposes , it is often convenient to work with the distribution per volume per _ log _ luminosity , given by @xmath52 we shall use this form in making plots of the luminosity function .",
    "one drawback of assuming a parameterized form of the luminosity function is that it constrains the luminosity function to have a certain functional form , which may not be general enough to accurately reflect the actual luminosity function .",
    "a non - parametric approach to determining the luminosity function does not suffer from this limitation .",
    "we model the differential luminosity function as being piecewise - constant over @xmath53 bins evenly spaced in @xmath54 from the minimum to maximum luminosities seen in the sample , and then treat the value of the function on these bins as the @xmath53 parameters with respect to which the likelihood ( defined exactly as before ) is to be maximized .",
    "this avoids any implicit assumptions of the functional form that the luminosity function should have , but also sacrifices any requirements as to continuity and smoothness that physical intuition suggests should be satisfied .",
    "this approach was first suggested by nicoll & segal ( 1980 ; 1983 ) , and was reinvented by efstathiou ( 1988 ) . rather than attempting to search for a minimum in some high @xmath53-dimensional parameter space ,",
    "the technique is to converge iteratively to the optimal step values .",
    "the interested reader is referred to the appendix or efstathiou  ( 1988 ) for details .",
    "there are several drawbacks to the non - parametric luminosity function method .",
    "the most obvious is that the resultant luminosity function is discontinuous ; this can be overcome by interpolating linearly between the centers of the bins ; the details are set forth in the appendix .",
    "we in fact use this interpolating method in what follows below .",
    "more serious is the effect illustrated below ; a strong sensitivity of the derived luminosity function to bin size .",
    "the robust method of snwz calculates the luminosity function in two steps . for a given sample with maximum redshift @xmath55",
    ", there is a luminosity @xmath56 above which a galaxy can be found anywhere in the volume of the survey , so @xmath57 in this luminosity range is simply proportional to the number of galaxies at each value of @xmath13 . for lower luminosities",
    ", however , the volume in which a galaxy could be found is an increasing function of the luminosity , requiring further calculation to determine the luminosity function .",
    "nicoll & segal ( 1983 ) and snwz argue that the number of bins @xmath58 used _ in the lower - luminosity range alone _ should be set the same when comparing different cosmologies , in order to avoid giving any one cosmology extra degrees of freedom .",
    "clearly , @xmath59 by definition .    with this in mind ,",
    "[ fig : comparephi_p1 ] and [ fig : comparephi_p2 ] show the resultant luminosity functions derived under the assumption of @xmath60 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "we plot the parameterized luminosity function ( eq .  [ eq : yahil - diff ] , using the parameters of table  [ table : yahil123parms ] ) as a solid curve , and superimpose the luminosity functions derived using the nonparametric method for several different binnings : the bin size used by snwz ( in @xmath61 ) , @xmath62 as recommended by snwz , and @xmath63 is dependent on the sample and the assumed value of @xmath55 , our @xmath62 case has a different bin size than that of snwz . ] .",
    "we plot error bars only for the non - parametric luminosity function that most closely approaches the parametric one .",
    "the bin sizes and number of bins for these and other luminosity functions are tabulated in table  [ table : segalstats ] below .",
    "we also plot the luminosity functions of snwz for comparison ( normalized using eq .",
    "[ eq : n1 ] ) .",
    "different bin sizes result in appreciable differences in the faint end of the luminosity function ; in particular , the fewer the number of bins , the more the faint end of the luminosity function is attenuated .    at the bottom of these plots",
    "we have placed histograms indicating the distribution of the luminosities from which our luminosity functions were computed ; note that the luminosity distribution of the galaxies in the sample narrows significantly with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "for @xmath8 , note that the luminosity function we find using the snwz binning is close to the luminosity function found by snwz themselves .",
    "however , this bin size is large enough to strongly bias the luminosity function at the faint end ; the luminosity function does not become stable until the number of bins approaches @xmath64 or more ( corresponding to @xmath65 ) .",
    "thereafter , the luminosity function found by the non - parametric method , which is in principle free to assume any shape at all , is in good agreement with the parametric luminosity function . for @xmath9 , the sensitivity to binning seems to be much less severe , and the luminosity functions we find for all binnings are in very good agreement . in this case",
    ", we were able to reproduce the snwz luminosity function only with a very small number of bins @xmath66 , corresponding to @xmath67 ( not shown ) .",
    "the data set used by snwz consisted of the brighter half of the present one , flux density - limited at 1.936  jy at 60  @xmath0 m .",
    "this makes little difference ; we find that the luminosity function from different subsets in flux density is quite robust ( koranyi 1993 ) , as long as @xmath58 is large enough .",
    "the biasing in the luminosity function due to binning is more severe for @xmath8 than for @xmath9 , and therefore statistics for different values of @xmath7 using these luminosity functions can give misleading results if the binning used is overly coarse .",
    "indeed , we now show that with the bin size recommended by snwz , @xmath9 is indeed a better fit to the data than is @xmath8 , while with finer binning , @xmath8 is preferred .",
    "having derived a luminosity function for the sample under the assumption that the density and luminosity distributions of the sample are separable , we are now in a position to test the relative merits of the hubble and lundmark laws .",
    "we can test for robustness of the luminosity function , and also for self - consistency in the predictive powers of the luminosity function under the assumption of various power law cosmologies .",
    "these comparisons separate naturally into those that do and do not depend on the assumption that the galaxy distribution is uniform on large scales .",
    "we start with the latter , following snwz .",
    "snwz argue strongly that it is important to distinguish between cosmological tests that involve quantities which depend on the cosmology itself ( such as luminosity , or the luminosity function ) , and those that are pure observables ( such as flux density , or equivalently magnitude , and redshift ) .",
    "moreover , they develop statistical tests that do not depend on the assumption that the distribution of galaxies is uniform in space .",
    "the statistics on which they put the greatest weight are @xmath68 , the standard deviation of apparent magnitudes in a sample , and @xmath48 , the slope of the regression of the apparent magnitudes on log redshift ( the notation is that of snwz ) . before calculating these statistics , it is useful to examine fig .",
    "[ fig : mag - redshift ] , which is the observed relation between apparent magnitudes ( defined here , following snwz , as @xmath69 ) and @xmath70 .",
    "the correlation between these two quantities is not very strong .",
    "the line shown is the regression line of @xmath6 on @xmath70 for the subsample of galaxies with @xmath71 ; we have found that these statistics are very sensitive to the exact lower - redshift cutoff at redshifts below 2000 .",
    "table  [ table : segalstats ] gives the observed values of @xmath68 and @xmath48 .",
    "snwz calculate the expected values of these statistics using monte - carlo simulations . here",
    "we will do so analytically .    given a model for the luminosity function and a value of @xmath7",
    ", one can calculate the probability distribution function of flux density @xmath18 of galaxy @xmath72 , given its redshift @xmath30 .",
    "the distribution function for a single galaxy is given by the luminosity function , normalized appropriately , following eq .",
    "( [ eq : indivlike ] ) : @xmath73 where @xmath23 is the selection function , @xmath74 , and @xmath35 was defined above in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lmin ] ) . from this distribution function",
    ", we can easily calculate the moments of the apparent magnitudes , and therefore the scatter @xmath68 .",
    "similarly , we can calculate the expectation value of @xmath6 for each value of @xmath3 , from which @xmath48 follows directly .",
    "note that both these statistics depend on the observed distribution of redshifts , and can not be considered independent of this .",
    "table  [ table : segalstats ] shows the predicted results for @xmath75 , and 3 for various binnings for the subsample of galaxies with @xmath71 .",
    "it is clear that the results are quite sensitive to the details of the binning .",
    "let us start by concentrating on the results using the binning of snwz ( the first row for each value of @xmath7 ) .",
    "both @xmath9 and @xmath76 do a much better job of predicting the observed apparent magnitude scatter @xmath68 than does @xmath77 .",
    "we interpret this to be due to the fact that the @xmath8 luminosity function is much more biased at this coarse binning than that of @xmath9 .",
    "we find similar results at @xmath62 , as recommended by snwz .",
    "none of the models do a good job of reproducing the slope of regression , @xmath48 , with this binning , with @xmath8 overpredicting the observed value of @xmath48 by as much as @xmath9 underpredicts it .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : mag - redshift ] , however , that a linear fit to the magnitude - log redshift scatter diagram is a rather poor way to model the data , and that the results may be quite sensitive to a small number of outlying points .    with finer binning ( @xmath78 ) , and with the parametrized luminosity function ,",
    "the predictions for @xmath68 are essentially _ independent _ of @xmath7 . as petrosian ( 1993 ) first argued , and as we conclude below , without additional assumptions , it is very difficult to distinguish cosmologies from redshift and magnitude data alone . however , note that the @xmath8 does predict the correct value of @xmath48 with this larger number of bins ( the parametrized model does less well ) , while @xmath9 and @xmath76 fail quite badly .",
    "we describe the @xmath79 column in this table below .",
    "we can ask more of the data than simply these low - order statistics . indeed , eq .  ( [ eq : lumdist ] )",
    "gives a prediction for the flux density distribution of galaxies as a function of redshift ; we can compare this directly with what is observed .",
    "that is , the sum of these distribution functions over some subsample of a redshift survey can be compared with the _ observed _ flux density distribution as an _ a posteriori _ test of the luminosity function ( sandage  1979 ; yahil  1991 ; strauss & willick 1995 ) , or , in the present application , of the cosmology assumed . in other words ,",
    "the predicted distribution of galaxies of a given flux density @xmath18 is @xmath80 where the summation is over all galaxies in a particular ( sub)sample .",
    "the predicted and actual values in each bin can be compared with the @xmath79 statistic , yielding a measure of how similar the two distributions in fact are .",
    "[ fig : fluxdist ] shows the results for the full sample of galaxies ( @xmath81 ) , as well as for a variety of redshift subsamples .",
    "the observed distribution in flux density is indicated by the dots , and the predictions for @xmath60 and @xmath5 , using the luminosity functions with @xmath78 are indicated by the solid and dashed curves , respectively . as expected for a flux density - limited sample , the distributions peak strongly towards the flux density limit of 1.2  jy , with a tail of higher flux density observations ; since this must be the case regardless of cosmology , we are not surprised that there are no gross morphological differences between the flux density distributions for the competing cosmologies .",
    "indeed , the difference between the predicted curves for @xmath60 and @xmath5 is very small .",
    "following yahil  ( 1991 ) , we calculate the @xmath79 statistic of the difference between the predicted and observed curves , using poisson error bars and summing only over bins with five or more galaxies .",
    "the results are tabulated in table  [ table : fluxchi2 ] .",
    "the fit with @xmath60 is acceptable in all bins .",
    "@xmath5 fares rather worse ; although it is acceptable in several of the redshift bins , the fit for the full sample is unacceptable . for @xmath51 ( not shown in the figure ) the fit in most redshift bins is unacceptable .",
    "the quantity @xmath19 in table  [ table : fluxchi2 ] is the number of bins of flux density in which the comparison is done .",
    "one might argue that this number should be reduced by the number of free parameters in the luminosity function ( 25 , in these cases ! ) .",
    "we make two points here : first , we have found qualitatively very similar results to those presented here when we use the parameterized luminosity function of eq .",
    "( [ eq : yahil - diff ] ) , which uses only three parameters ( table  [ table : yahil123parms ] ) .",
    "second , note that the fit to the luminosity function is done for galaxies with redshifts between 500 and 12,000 ; for @xmath8 , this fit remains good for galaxies between 12,000 and 20,000 , while for @xmath9 and @xmath76 , the fit is unacceptable in this range .",
    "[ fig : fluxdist_segal ] repeats this exercise using the snwz binning .",
    "the fits are not nearly as good as before , especially at the lowest luminosities .",
    "this is quantified in the @xmath79 statistics tabulated in table  [ table : fluxchi2_segalstep ] . however , although no value of @xmath7 is acceptable , @xmath9 is much preferred over @xmath8 , especially for the full sample .",
    "we saw in figs .",
    "[ fig : comparephi_p1 ] and [ fig : comparephi_p2 ] that @xmath62 corresponds to a bin size which gives a strongly biased luminosity function for @xmath8 , but that the bias was much less severe for @xmath82 .",
    "we explore the effect of binning further in table  [ table : segalstats ] .",
    "the @xmath79 column gives the @xmath79 values ( for @xmath83 ) for the flux density comparison for a variety of binnings , for the sample with @xmath71 . by this statistic , @xmath8 is strongly ruled out with @xmath62 or with the snwz binning ( doing much more poorly than even @xmath76 ) , while with either @xmath78 or with the parametrized luminosity function , @xmath8 gives acceptable results .",
    "we believe that this is the origin of the claims of snwz . with proper determination of the luminosity function ,",
    "the distribution function of flux densities given the redshifts can be predicted almost as well with @xmath9 as with @xmath84 ; it is very insensitive to cosmology , as was pointed out originally by petrosian ( 1993 ) .",
    "however , the luminosity function is biased if one chooses too low a value of @xmath58 , and this effect is more severe for @xmath8 than for @xmath9 , causing one to erroneously conclude that @xmath9 is preferred by the data .    our conclusion from this discussion , mirroring that of petrosian ( 1993 )",
    ", is that _ any _ statistic derived from the distribution of flux densities and redshifts will be able to match the data roughly equally well for @xmath8 or @xmath9 , without making further assumptions about the distributions .",
    "one such assumption we could make is that the universe approaches homogeneity on the largest scales ( the cosmological principle ; cf . , peebles 1993 ) .",
    "with such an assumption , we can derive further statistics that do allow a sharp distinction between different values of @xmath7 .",
    "under the homogeneous approximation , one can predict the distribution of galaxies with redshift , given the luminosity function and a value of @xmath7 . in a shell of thickness @xmath85 at a redshift @xmath3",
    ", one expects there to be @xmath86 galaxies , where @xmath87 is the solid angle covered by the sample ( 11.06 ster in our case ; cf .",
    "strauss  1990 ) .",
    "these predictions for various @xmath7 are shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : zdist ] , along with the observed distribution with redshift ( we use @xmath78 throughout this section ) .",
    "the lower panel shows the ratio of the observed to predicted counts ( which is the fractional density of the shell relative to the mean over the sample ) .",
    "the @xmath60 curve agrees closely with the observed distribution , although the agreement is not perfect .",
    "the effects of the local supercluster at @xmath88 km s@xmath44 and of the great attractor and pisces - perseus regions at @xmath89 km s@xmath44 are visible as overdensities , even when averaged over almost the entire sky . at very large redshifts ,",
    "the @xmath60 curve slightly overestimates the observed distribution , probably because of incompleteness of the sample at high redshifts ( fisher  1992 ) .",
    "however , if either the @xmath5 or @xmath51 model were correct , one would have to argue that as one looks to higher redshifts in the universe , the inhomogeneities grow .",
    "the galaxy density plotted in the lower panel would need to be a strong function of redshift : low nearby , rising rapidly to a maximum at 5000  10,000 km s@xmath44 , and then dropping by a factor of two thereafter .",
    "this would violate the cosmological principle , and indeed , if such massive structures were common in the universe , we would see them reflected in the angular correlation function of faint galaxies ( _ e.g. _ maddox 1990 ) .    indeed , one can calculate the distribution of densities on shells as a function of redshift , without any calculation of the luminosity function at all ( saunders  1990 ) . in   2 above , we calculated the distribution function of luminosities conditioned on the redshifts @xmath33 . here",
    "we calculate the distribution of redshifts conditioned on the luminosities @xmath90 , which is given by : @xmath91 where @xmath92 when we conditioned on redshift ( eq .",
    "[ eq : indivlike ] ) , the density distribution dropped out of the expression , while here , the luminosity function drops out .",
    "we can now maximize the likelihood with respect to the density field defined at a series of steps , exactly as we did with the luminosity function , using the iterative technique described by efstathiou  ( 1988 ) .",

    "the agreement between this density field and that given by the curves , which depends on the calculation of the luminosity function , is striking ; this shows us that both the luminosity function and density field calculations are robust .",

    "[ fig : soneira ] shows this statistic in bins of log flux density for the full  sample ( solid points , with errors in the mean shown ) and also for the northern and southern galactic hemispheres of the sample separately ( open circles and stars , respectively ) , as a test of the robustness of the statistic to density inhomogeneities .",
    "the averaging is done for galaxies in the redshift range 500  to 20,000 . the @xmath8 prediction assuming @xmath98",
    "is given as the light solid line , while @xmath9 is shown with the light dashed line .",
    "these curves are not pure power laws , because of the upper limit on redshift we imposed .",
    "the @xmath8 line is not a perfect fit to the data ; one is presumably seeing the residual effect of density inhomogeneities , as is made clear by the differences between the northern and southern hemispheres , especially at large flux densities .",
    "however , @xmath9 does much more poorly , especially at large flux densities .",
    "this is not unexpected : as fig .",
    "[ fig : zdist ] showed , the homogeneity assumption is a very poor one for the @xmath9 model .",
    "we can include this effect by carrying out the integration of eq .",
    "( [ eq : z - given - f ] ) , using the density field found non - parametrically in fig .",
    "[ fig : zdist ] ; the results are shown as the heavy solid and dashed line for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath8 line is now in excellent agreement with the data , while the @xmath9 line approaches the data points somewhat more closely , but is still far from a good fit to the data .",
    "it is not clear whether this represents a breakdown of the universal luminosity function assumption which went into eq .",
    "( [ eq : z - given - f ] ) , for the case of @xmath9 .",
    "the density - dependent methods of comparing the cosmologies favor @xmath60 quite unambiguously . however , one reaches this conclusion only with the auxiliary assumption that the density field of galaxies approaches homogeneity on large scales . in the case of the density - independent comparisons of the distribution of flux density , we have recourse to quantitative @xmath79 testing of goodness - of - fit , and we find that the standard @xmath60 cosmology yields better agreement than does the @xmath5 case .",
    "but perhaps most surprising is the extent to which these methods do a poor job of discriminating between different values of @xmath7 , implying that the results of any analysis predicated on their use should be interpreted with great caution .",
    "these results are in accord with the analytic arguments of petrosian ( 1993 ) : without additional assumptions , questions of cosmology and the appropriate luminosity function can not be decoupled from flux density and redshift data , and that one can not determine both simultaneously .    a further methodological pitfall which affects snwz is the sensitivity of the non - parametric luminosity function to bin size .",
    "snwz used very coarse binning and therefore were working with luminosity functions inaccurate at the faint end .",
    "since this effect is less pronounced for @xmath5 than for @xmath60 , the luminosity function that snwz employed for @xmath5 was less in error than the one they employed for @xmath60 .",
    "we found that with equally coarse binning , this effect causes @xmath9 to be favored , both by the statistics used by snwz and by our own comparisons of the flux density distribution .",
    "therefore from redshift survey data alone , one can conclude that @xmath84 is preferred only weakly over @xmath9 if we only allow ourselves the assumption of a universal luminosity function .",
    "when one makes the additional assumption that the distribution of galaxies approaches isotropy on large scales , the case for @xmath8 becomes _ much _ stronger ; indeed , if @xmath9 , one would need to argue that the density field of galaxies beyond 10,000  drops dramatically and steadily with redshift . when this is combined with the observed linearity of the redshift - distance diagram using measurements of extragalactic standard candles ( cf .",

    "the piecewise - constant luminosity function as defined by efstathiou  ( 1988 ) has one drawback ; the corresponding selection function ( defined from eqs .  [ eq : selfunct ] and [ eq : psi ] ) shows a scalloping effect ( cf . , strauss & koranyi 1994 ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scallop ] , which shows the ratio of the selection function calculated from the piecewise - constant luminosity function ( dashed line ) calculated with bins of @xmath99 , to the analytic selection function ( from eq .",

    "these were calculated for @xmath8 .",
    "the selection function of the piecewise - continuous luminosity function has a discontinuity in slope at the edge of each bin ( as indeed it must ; the slope is proportional to the luminosity function itself ) .",
    "the effect is minimized here by using small bins , but nevertheless it would be best to eliminate this altogether .",
    "we do so by generalizing the method of efstathiou  ( 1988 ) to define the luminosity function not as constant in a series of bins , but rather as a series of line segments connecting bins .",
    "the formalism of efstathiou  can be carried over exactly , if we replace equations 2.8 - 2.11 of that paper with the following .",
    "define the luminosity function to be a series of line segments connecting a series of points @xmath100 into those regions above and below @xmath101 .",
