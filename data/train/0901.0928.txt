    "our understanding of dark matter structures has increased significantly over the last years . this progress has mainly been driven by pure dark matter numerical simulations which have suggested or identified a range of universalities .",
    "one of the first general properties to be suggested is the radial density profile @xcite .",
    "also more complex connections relating integrated quantities have been suggested , including the pseudo phase - space density being a power - law in radius @xcite , @xmath1 , or a connection between the velocity profile and the density slope @xcite , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 . finally , a connection between angular momentum and mass has been identified @xcite , @xmath5 .",
    "only few attempts have been made at identifying universalities in the actual velocity distribution function  @xcite , since non - integrated quantities require a very large number of particles in the equilibrated structure .    a wide range of theoretical ideas and models",
    "have been devised trying to explain these phenomenological profiles and relations .",
    "first of all , the general properties of the density profiles  @xcite can be derived analytically under the assumption that phase - space density is a power - law in radius @xcite .",
    "this is done simply by inserting the phase - space density into the jeans equation , and then solving it .",
    "this procedure reveals one unique mathematical solution , which is physically plausible in the equilibrated region of the dark matter structures .",
    "a completely different approach is made in the barcelona model  @xcite , where slow accretion in a generalized press - schechter model allows one to derive density profiles which are in very good agreement with the profiles observed in numerical simulation .",
    "it thus appears that there are ( at least ) two completely different possible explanations for the structural property of the density : one being that the density profile is slowly grown according to the parameters in the expanding universe , and the other possibility is that irrespective of how the structures are formed , then some unknown dynamical process forces the phase - space density to be a power - law in radius , which through the jeans equation gives the density profile itself .",
    "@xcite argue that this process is violent relaxation .",
    "a different theoretical approach to get the density profile is a series expansion of the coupled collisionless boltzmann and poisson equations which is renormalized in ` time ' @xcite .",
    "however , when comparing to numerical results , it appears that this last theoretical approach still leaves room for improvements  @xcite .",
    "the relation between angular momentum and mass , which was discovered in numerical simulations  @xcite , has been explored in the barcelona model of accretion - driven formation of cosmological structures @xcite .",
    "it appears that the results of this theoretical model are in rather good agreement with the results of numerical simulations .",
    "it is therefore tempting to conclude , that the kinematic and structural parameters may indeed be governed by the physics behind the barcelona model - at least until we find another convincing derivation of the @xmath6 relation based on different assumptions .",
    "this is exactly what we set out to do in this paper .    in general when dealing with the angular momentum of dark matter in galaxies people often use the so - called spin parameter @xmath7 , introduced by @xcite , as a common reference point .",
    "here @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the angular momentum , the binding energy and the total mass of the system and the newtonian gravitational constant respectively .",
    "the spin parameter roughly corresponds to the ratio between the overall angular momentum of the object and the angular momentum this object needs to sustain rotational support .",
    "one of the reasons why @xmath0 is",
    "so widely accepted as a good indicator of the angular momentum , is that it has the ability of being ( almost ) constant in time , under the assumptions that the system is more or less isolated and that there is no dissipation present ( assuring that @xmath9 and @xmath8 are both conserved ) .",
    "the usual size of the spin parameter is in the ballpark of 0.05 @xcite , meaning little systematic rotation and negligible rotational support .",
    "there is still no agreement on the origin of the angular momentum .",
    "two different scenarios have been tested against each other ( e.g. by @xcite ) .",
    "the first scenario states that the angular momentum of structures originates from the merging history , and hence is dependent on how and when the given structure formed @xcite .",
    "the second scenario explains the appearance of angular momentum as a consequence of linear tidal torques between density fluctuations in the early stages of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "we will show below that the generalized jeans equation includes a term governing the profile of the angular momentum .",
    "this allows us to suggest an angular momentum profile directly from the jeans equation , with no reference to the specific way the structures were assembled .",
    "this contrasts the claim that merger history is crucial when describing angular momentum .",
    "we use results from recent high resolution n - body simulations to show that the angular momentum profile of the numerically equilibrated dark matter ( dm ) structures shows good agreement with our suggested relation .",
    "this indicates that the angular momentum profile is fixed through the jeans equation , irrespective of the detailed structure formation process .",
    "this result is supported by the numerical results of @xcite and @xcite , who conclude that `` equilibrium dark matter haloes show no significant correlation between spin and merging history '' .",
    "we present a connection between the radial profiles of the angular momentum and the velocity anisotropy .",
    "this correlation is also shown to be in fair agreement with numerical simulations .",
    "finally we combine our suggested relation between the angular momentum and the mass with the spin parameter , and find that the radial dependence of this spin parameter is in fair agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "in general nothing ensures that the particle ensemble in a dm halo is spherical .",
    "nevertheless it makes the approach relatively simple and analytically manageable , without being far from the real triaxial picture .",
    "the system is then governed by the spherical(ly symmetric ) collisionless boltzmann equation ( cbe ) ( with the velocity distribution function being a function of the radial dependence alone ) .",
    "one might also use other ( more complicated ) forms of the df ( e.g. @xcite ) but this would make the approach analytically cumbersome . the cbe describes the relation between the spatial distribution function , the gravitational potential and the velocity distribution of the dm particles .    combining the first moment of the cbe with the spherical poisson equation , one can write the general spherical jeans equation for the dm particle ensemble , under the assumption that the thermal velocities are independent of each other , and that there is no bulk ( rotational ) motion  @xcite @xmath12 here @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the velocity dispersions , @xmath16 is the density , @xmath10 is the total mass within radius @xmath17 , and @xmath11 is the gravitational constant .",
    "we wish to consider the angular momentum , so we will now include a small radial dependent bulk rotation , @xmath18 .",
    "we explicitly write the velocity in the following way @xmath19 which means that the azimuthal velocity goes from being purely thermal to containing both thermal and bulk motion .    in general @xmath20",
    "is not a function of the spherical radius @xmath17 , but more likely a function of the cylindrical radius @xmath21 .",
    "so when we in the following refer to @xmath18 , what we really mean is , that the radial velocity has been averaged over a spherical shell with radius @xmath17 .",
    "this is also the way @xmath20 is defined in the simulations we will compare with in section  [ sec : sim ] .",
    "furthermore since the effect of bulk rotation can not depend on direction , we only consider the absolute value of @xmath20 .",
    "the simplest way to add rotation to our system , is to give every particle an initial kick .",
    "this would result in a shift of the distribution function ( df ) @xmath22 , towards a higher mean velocity by the amount added , call it @xmath20 . since we need the structure to be a relaxed system in equilibrium we ca nt allow this .",
    "a pure shift of the df would enable the most energetic particles to escape the system , and thereby bring it out of equilibrium .",
    "instead of just shifting the df we force it to be distorted into a new df @xmath23 , making sure that the system is always in equilibrium .    to be able to implement such a distortion into eq .",
    "( [ eqn : cje ] ) we will now parametrize the distortion of the df . as a first step ,",
    "we assume that the difference in the two dfs is just a small perturbation to the overall system .",
    "furthermore the distortion must depend on the added bulk rotation so that we have @xmath24 here @xmath25 is some unknown function depending on @xmath20 which we will evaluate later .    as mentioned above , simply shifting the df by @xmath26 while leaving the shape of the df virtually unchanged would allow energetic particles to escape .",
    "the perturbation of the df must therefore also depend on the azimuthal velocity itself , such that the amount of distortion is not the same at all velocities . introducing another unknown function @xmath27",
    "we then have @xmath28 furthermore , we will demand that the overall density of the system is not affected by the added bulk rotation , i.e , @xmath29 .",
    "the density is statistically defined as @xmath30 where we have used that @xmath31 .",
    "ensuring that the density is unaffected by the added rotation is easily done by restricting @xmath32 to be an odd function when integrated over the velocities , such that the last integral vanishes . assuming that @xmath27 is a simple power law in the azimuthal velocity with a positive odd integer exponent ( to be motivated later in this section ) this is accomplished and we have @xmath33 with @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 being an unknown constant .",
    "the @xmath37 part of the parameterization on this power law form will in principle give problems for @xmath38 , causing the distortion of the df to become infinite and hence @xmath23 to become negative , but since @xmath39 is nearly zero for @xmath40 , this is not a practical problem .",
    "however , for a more formal derivation one naturally can not allow @xmath23 to become negative .",
    "thus , by making @xmath41 an odd integer , what we have done ( using eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ffa ] ) ) is to create a new df , @xmath23 , that generates the density @xmath16 by adding an odd - powered df concerning @xmath42 to our original df , @xmath22 .",
    "this is somewhat similar to the discussion in @xcite section 4.5 .    in principle , the assumption in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ff ] ) can be tested with high resolution n - body simulations , by considering the two tangential velocity distribution functions ( vdfs ) , and simply looking for the difference between the shapes of the vdfs in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the angular momentum vector .",
    "this we can do using the n - body / gas dynamical simulated large disc galaxy k15 @xcite .",
    "the k15 simulation is a significantly improved version of the treesph code used previously for galaxy formation simulations @xcite .",
    "this simulation is based on a flat @xmath43cdm model with @xmath44 .",
    "the simulation takes many of the important factors of galaxy formation into account such as sn feedback , gas recycling ( tracing 10 elements ) , atomic radiative cooling , etc .",
    "it consist of both cold and warm gas , dm , disk and bulge stars and stellar satellites .",
    "the galaxy k15 contains about @xmath45 gas and dm particles and it has @xmath46 and @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore the gravitational ( spline ) softening lengths adopted are @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dfdis ] we have plotted the vdfs of the dm particles of one of the bins outside the stellar disk region in k15. we clearly see that the df including rotation ( red dashed line ) is indeed distorted compared to the radial vdf ( black solid line ) and the tangential vdf parallel to the angular momentum vector ( blue dot - dashed line ) .",
    "this supports our assumption of a distortion of the df caused by the added bulk rotation .",
    "furthermore we realize that the distortion seems to grow ( i.e. , the difference between the two red dashed lines enhances ) as the velocity grows out to about 2 - 3 @xmath51 , beyond which the number of particles in each bin of the simulation is too small to conclude anything .",
    "this further motivates a form of @xmath27 similar to the one suggested in eq.([eqn : ff ] ) .    to be able to see the effects the added rotation has on the system in general , the goal is to get an expression for the jeans equation concerning a system to which a small bulk rotation has been added",
    "this can be accomplished by making an expression for the new perturbed velocity dispersion in the azimuthal direction , @xmath52 .",
    "the velocity dispersion of a system without rotation is given by @xmath53 by definition the velocity dispersion is the integral over the df multiplied with the difference between the individual particle velocities and the mean velocity of the system . since the mean velocity after adding rotation becomes equal to the added rotation itself",
    ", the new perturbed azimuthal velocity dispersion must take the form @xmath54 where it is easily shown that @xmath55 .    using that @xmath56 , i.e.",
    ", @xmath22 is an even function in velocity space , that @xmath32 is an odd function to conserve the density and that @xmath31 , combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dispdef ] ) and ( [ eq : dispdef2 ] ) gives @xmath57 since it is known from numerical cosmological simulations that the rotational energy is less than a few percent of the thermal energy @xcite , i.e. , @xmath58 it is justified to ignore the higher order term in @xmath20 .",
    "this combined with eq .",
    "( [ eq : dispdef ] ) implies that @xmath59 thus the new velocity dispersion can be written as the old one plus a term concerning the distortion of the df as well as the rotation . combining this with the df distortion in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ff ] ) implies @xmath60 we are then left with evaluating an integral on the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 is an even number ( gamma is odd ) . recognizing that the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : momint ] ) is just the expression for the @xmath63th moment , @xmath64 , for @xmath42 centered around the mean @xmath65 gives @xmath66 combining this with the expression for the perturbed velocity dispersion in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vphi2 ] ) gives @xmath67    we are now able to quantify the @xmath20 dependency of the distortion of the df , i.e. , the function @xmath25 . an easy way to evaluate the function @xmath25 is by rearranging eq .",
    "( [ eq : sig0 ] ) so that @xmath68 using the k15 simulation again we are then able to estimate the actual size of @xmath25 as a function of the rotation . calculating the relevant quantities from the simulation and plotting @xmath25 as a function of @xmath20 gives fig .",
    "[ fig : pvrot ] . from this figure , which is showing the numerically resolved region of the structure , we see that @xmath25 seems to depend liniarly on the rotation , meaning that in this region of the structure @xmath69 where the @xmath70s are constants",
    ". however one must keep in mind that ( outside the resolved region ) @xmath25 must go to 0 for vanishing @xmath20 . combining this with expression ( [ eq : sig0 ] ) and again ignoring higher order terms in @xmath20 leaves us with @xmath71 here we have introduced the constant @xmath72 ( for simplicity ) .",
    "thus , what we have done here is simply inserting the linear dependence of @xmath25 on @xmath20 into eq .  ( [ eq : sig0 ] ) and using that @xmath58 as done in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vphi ] ) .",
    "as mentioned @xmath73 is just the moment corresponding to the chosen value of @xmath41 ( where @xmath74 ) , i.e. , a constant .",
    "and since the above result only relies on the restrictions on @xmath41 it implies that the choice of @xmath41 does nt result in loss of generality .",
    "thus we are free to choose any value of @xmath41 when investigating the above equation .",
    "we will chose @xmath75 since we are then able to estimate the size of the moment .",
    "the fourth moment , i.e. , the kurtosis of a gaussian df is 3 , and since we expect the dfs of dm structures to be gaussian like , using @xmath75 will make it easier to compare with simulations .",
    "this implies that @xmath76 this expression is of course a consequence of the assumed form of @xmath27 .",
    "one could definitely argue for other forms of @xmath27 fulfilling the request @xmath77 , e.g. an exponential form or a combination of both exponential and power law .",
    "however in order to simplify the analytical calculation of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vphi ] ) we have chosen the simple power law form . in the future it would definitely be interesting to test other forms of @xmath27 ( and @xmath25 ) to see if this effects the final results and conclusions significantly .",
    "we intend to make a qualitative estimation of both q and p in a following paper .",
    "this will , among other things , require a larger sample of high resolution equilibrated structures ( both pure dm as well as dm+gas simulations ) and that we systematically test the effects of using either spherical or potential bins , of the structures non - sphericity etc .    combining eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sig ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ eqn : cje ] ) ( for a perturbed system , i.e. , @xmath78 ) leaves us with a jeans equation containing four terms .",
    "the 3 normal ones , dealing with the density , mass and velocity dispersion profile , and one new term describing the effect that rotation has on the system @xmath79 where the anisotropy is given by @xmath80 .",
    "here we assume that @xmath81 , which states that the thermal velocity moments in the tangential directions are equal , irrespective of the magnitude of the ( small ) bulk rotation .",
    "note that simply substituting @xmath82 into the ( perturbed ) jeans equation leaves us with a jeans equation , only involving the unperturbed velocity dispersions .",
    "the dominating terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : new ] ) are the derivative and the mass terms . making the conjecture that the rotation term , which is just a minor perturbation of the jeans equation , must follow the profile of the dominating mass term , and assuming ( for now ) that @xmath83 , we get directly from eq .",
    "( [ eq : new ] ) a relation between the rotational perturbation and the dominating mass , which reads @xmath84 in principle many other solutions , than the conjecture of the small term following the dominant one used above , are allowed to exist , but these would all imply some degree of compensation or fine - tuning between the various terms .",
    "we therefore suspect that there is a more physical explanation for why the @xmath85 term is proportional to @xmath86 than our conjecture , but none has been found so far .",
    "the different structures may have fairly different magnitudes of the angular momentum , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : vm ] ) expresses only that the radial _ profile _ of the angular momentum is always the same , however , the absolute _ magnitude _ is unknown , and may vary from structure to structure .    in a similar way we can look at the relationship between the @xmath87 and the rotational term .",
    "we find from eq .",
    "( [ eq : new ] ) that this connection is @xmath88 this relation implies that if @xmath89 goes to 0 , the rotation term should go to 0 as well . since we are here suggesting a relation between the two minor terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : new ] ) the relation  ( [ eq : vbeta ] ) might not be as strong as relation  ( [ eq : vm ] ) .",
    "the case @xmath90 does not occur in the equilibrated part of the simulated dm halo structure and has therefore no relevance to the problem at hand .",
    "we are aware that @xmath89 is marginally smaller than 0 in dm05 .",
    "in fact some of our structures also have @xmath91 in some of the inner most bins .",
    "but since we , as well as dm05 , are working with simulations which are known to have difficulties simulating structures at the innermost parts , such values ( which are not much below 0 ) must be considered in agreement with 0 within errors and does therefore not conflict our suggested relation between beta and @xmath20 . if on the other hand cosmological simulations were to produce an equilibrated structure with a clear trend that a fully resolved smooth region of the structure had @xmath90 this would definitely question the validity of our work .    note that including a centrifugal term into the equations will basically give a small energy conserving perturbation , which goes as @xmath92 , to the new azimuthal velocity dispersion .",
    "however this perturbation is so small that it is not visible in the numerical simulations , and it is therefore ignored .",
    "it is now straight forward to test these suggested relations with the results from numerical simulations .",
    "we have argued that there may be clear relations between the new rotational supplement to the jeans equation and the mass- and anisotropy - terms .",
    "to test this we used 10 intermediately resolved galaxy and cluster sized numerical simulations of dm halos @xcite , one high resolution cluster , c@xmath93.w3 , and one high resolution galaxy , the via lactea simulation @xcite .",
    "the 10 intermediately resolved simulations have been performed using pkdgrav , a treecode written by joachim stadel and thomas quinn @xcite .",
    "the initial conditions are generated with the grafic2 package @xcite .",
    "the starting redshifts @xmath94 are set to the time when the standard deviation of the smallest density fluctuations resolved within the simulation box reaches @xmath95 ( the smallest scale resolved within the initial conditions is defined as twice the intra - particle distance ) .",
    "all the halos were identified using a so ( spherical overdensity ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "the cluster - like haloes have been extracted from a 63.9 @xmath96 simulation containing @xmath97 particles , with a mass resolution of @xmath98 .",
    "the masses of the clusters used for this study are 2.1 , 1.8 , and 1.6 @xmath99 . the galaxy sized haloes have been obtained by re - simulating at high resolution haloes found in the previous simulation .",
    "the simulated haloes are in the mass range @xmath100 and have a mass resolution of @xmath101 that gives a minimum number of particles per halo of about @xmath102 particles .",
    "the high resolution cluster c@xmath93.w3 , based on the pkdgrav as well , has 11 millions particles within its virial radius and a mass of @xmath103 .",
    "the via lactea ( which is also based on the pkdgrav code ) simulation includes 234 million particles with force resolution of 90 pc , and it includes one highly equilibrated structure of mass @xmath104 , containing about 84 million particles @xcite .",
    "plotting the rotation - term against the mass for the different simulations gives fig .",

    "[ fig : vmall ] we see a clear linear relation between the two terms .",
    "this means that the generalized jeans equation ( eq .  ( [ eq : new ] ) ) determines the radial behavior of the rotation , i.e. the angular momentum @xmath105 .",
    "this also explains why @xcite find a strong relation between the angular momentum and the mass in their simulations , since our conjecture resembles the results of @xcite when @xmath106 is constant .",
    "we have tested that this relation is not just an effect of choosing ( actually deriving ) a term in the jeans equation with the right units .",
    "for instance the term with @xmath107 does not have a correct relation to the mass ( as @xcite also conclude ) .    in a similar way we can test our suggested linear relation between @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",

    "we are therefore able to describe the spin parameter only as a function of mass and @xmath126 , without any dependence on the bulk rotation @xmath20 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambdar ] we have plotted eq .",
    "( [ eq : lam ] ) for the simulated structures .",
    "this figure agrees fairly well with fig .  5 of @xcite .",
    "if we estimate a gradient of our plot we get approximately 1/4 to 1/5 ( depending on the chosen structure ) , whereas an estimated gradient on fig .  5 in @xcite is closer to 1/6 .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( [ eq : vm ] ) appears to roughly explain the observed tendency of an increase in the spin parameter as a function of radius . as mentioned earlier",
    "a relation with a @xmath127 term instead of the @xmath128 term we suggest will according to simulations not give the correct relation to the mass . furthermore",
    "a result on the @xmath127 form implies a constant spin parameter as a function of radius , and since this is clearly not in agreement with the work by @xcite , we take this as yet another indication of the success of the relations in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vm ] ) and ( [ eq : vbeta ] ) .",
    "finally it have been suggested that the spin parameter does nt depend on the virial mass of the structures @xcite . to test this we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambdam ] , the values of @xmath129 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : lam ] ) taken at the virial radius of the structures . to calculate @xmath130 we used the values given in table  [ tab : eta ] .",
    "here we see the indication of a slight increase in spin as the virial mass of the structures grow .",
    "the linear fit in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambdam ] ( full line ) has an inclination of @xmath131 .",
    "one possible explanation for the indication of a mass dependence , might be the fact that the spin is taken at @xmath132 . as pointed out by @xcite",
    "the use of @xmath132 ( compared to their @xmath133 ) might be too non - conservative when estimating the various properties of equilibrated structures .",
    "on the other hand it is not surprising with a slight increase in spin , since the spin parameter as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lam ] ) basically resembles a relation between @xmath134 and @xmath135 similar to the one shown for @xmath121 in fig .",
    "[ fig : etam ] . nevertheless , because of the large scatter and error - bars in our points",
    "we must conclude that there is no ( significant ) dependence between our spin parameter and the virial mass of the structures .",
    "this is in agreement with the lower part of fig .  3 in @xcite , which also shows that a relatively large scatter in the points is usual .",
    "we have studied the form of the spherical jeans equation when one includes angular momentum , and we find that a bulk motion leads to the introduction of an extra term , which includes the average rotational velocity .",
    "this is done under the assumption that the distortion of the distribution function takes the form argued for in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ff ] ) .",
    "this assumption is supported by numerically simulated structures .",
    "the distortion enables us to suggest a new correlation between the angular momentum and the mass .",
    "this relation is in good agreement with the findings of recent high resolution numerical simulations of cosmological structures .",
    "we also suggest a correlation between the angular momentum and the velocity anisotropy profiles , which is also in fair agreement with numerical findings .",
    "these suggested relations imply that cosmological dark matter structures have angular momentum profiles which have the same universal properties , irrespective of how or when they were formed .",
    "finally we derive a new form of the spin parameter , @xmath129 , which is shown to increase slowly as a function of radius , in agreement with recent simulations .",
    "furthermore our relations indicate that there is no ( significant ) dependence between @xmath136 and @xmath135 .",
