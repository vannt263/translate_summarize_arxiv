    "<S> for various two dimensional non linear @xmath0 models , we present a direct comparison between the @xmath1 functions computed with the @xmath2 renormalization group and the @xmath1 functions measured by monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical and measured @xmath1 functions match each other nicely for models with a trivial topology , yet they disagree clearly for models containing topological defects . in these later cases , they are compatible with a phase transition at a finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the global properties of the manifold do matter , in contradiction with the assumption used in the @xmath2 rg computation .    </S>",
    "<S> = 10000    in this letter , we want to address problems related to phase transitions in two dimensions ( @xmath3 ) ( for models with continuous symmetries ) , the various non linear @xmath0 models ( nl@xmath0 m ) , the renormalization group ( rg ) , and the possible role of topological defects . </S>",
    "<S> first , we will review carefully our theoretical understanding of the various points just mentioned . </S>",
    "<S> then , we will present extensive monte carlo simulations for different nl@xmath0ms , and in particular a direct comparison with the rg @xmath1 function at @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> the most studied models of phase transitions with continuous symmetry are the @xmath4 heisenberg models ( or the @xmath5-components @xmath6 models , as they are widely believed to be in the same universality class ) . in two dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> the accepted picture is that they have a phase transition at @xmath7 , with a correlation length diverging as @xmath8 ( we will discuss below the special case of the @xmath9 or x - y model ) . </S>",
    "<S> this picture has been extended to essentially every two dimensional models with continuous symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> of particular interest are the non linear @xmath0 models . in a nl@xmath0 m </S>",
    "<S> , the field has values in a manifold @xmath10 , taken as the coset of a lie group @xmath11 by a subgroup @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> these models are constructed so as to have a phase transition from a high temperature phase with symmetry @xmath11 broken down to a low temperature phase with symmetry @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> their importance comes from the fact that , if there is universality in this larger class of models , the nl@xmath0 m  is the canonical model to describe a phase transition with symmetry @xmath11 broken down to @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the nl@xmath0ms  correspond to the limit where all massive modes are neglected . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest example of a nl@xmath0 m  is constructed with @xmath13 broken down to @xmath14 , the manifold @xmath15 is the @xmath16 dimensional sphere . a point on a unit sphere </S>",
    "<S> is conveniently described by a @xmath5-components unit vector , and we find again the usual @xmath4 heisenberg model .    </S>",
    "<S> polyakov @xcite initiated the rg computations in @xmath17 for the heisenberg models . </S>",
    "<S> the method was then further applied to all nl@xmath0ms@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea is to expand the hamiltonian in a spin waves perturbation in the low temperature phase , i.e. to expand in the small displacements around an ordered state . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , this method probes only the local structure of the manifolds . </S>",
    "<S> this is embodied by the resulting @xmath1 function , which depends only on the curvature of the manifolds ( at two loops order ) , a purely local geometrical quantity . in two dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> the computations predict generically a phase transition at @xmath7 , with a correlation length diverging exponentially fast . however , the basic idea may appear dubious , because the transition between a low temperature phase ( which depends only on the local properties of @xmath18 ) and a high temperature phase ( which depends on the global properties of @xmath18 ) ought not to depend only on the local properties of the manifold . </S>",
    "<S> strictly in two dimensions , the low temperature phase is even nonexistent , and yet , using this fictitious phase , we obtain predictions in the high temperature phase ! the importance of the @xmath2 rg computations comes from the fact that , except for the heisenberg case , we do not have that many other reliable methods to obtain information about phase transitions ( see e.g. @xcite for a discussion of the problems related to the computations from the upper critical dimension and for the large @xmath5-expansion for the stiefel model ) . to make it worse </S>",
    "<S> , we are often interested in three dimensional systems , or in quantum systems , i.e. to take @xmath19 in the @xmath17 expansion . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we need to have a reliable understanding of what happens at @xmath20 . finally , let us note that , if the perturbative rg gives a prediction for the asymptotic regime ( i.e. @xmath21 ) , it gives no estimate for the correlation length ( or temperature ) at which the asymptotic regime is reached .    </S>",
    "<S> the role of topological defects in two dimensions is a related lingering problem . </S>",
    "<S> most of our comprehension comes from the x - y or @xmath9 heisenberg model . </S>",
    "<S> this model is unique for several reasons . </S>",
    "<S> the main one is that the manifold is of dimension one , and therefore possesses no curvature . </S>",
    "<S> this absence of curvature arises because the group @xmath22 is abelian . the related spin waves @xmath1 function is then identically zero . yet </S>",
    "<S> , this model possesses defects as @xmath23 , and this drives the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another peculiarity of the x - y model is the villain approximation @xcite , which decouples spin waves and defects , allowing to build a picture of the phase transition in terms of the defects only . </S>",
    "<S> other nl@xmath0ms have topological defects , as the related manifolds have some non trivial homotopy groups . yet all models other than the x - y model have curvatures . </S>",
    "<S> it has not been possible , up to now , to build an effective hamiltonian for the spin waves and the topological defects ( with their interactions ) starting from the bare models . however , according to the rg argument , the spin waves alone are enough to disorder the system , and the topological defects are simply irrelevant . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the nl@xmath0ms  offer a larger testing ground for two dimensional phase transitions , the rg , and for the role of topological defects , away from all the peculiarities of the @xmath9 heisenberg model .    </S>",
    "<S> essentially , the only tool at our disposal to test the various theoretical ideas presented above is the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we present a direct comparison between the @xmath1 function computed with the rg and the results of mc simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea is quite simple . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a model with cut - off @xmath24 and one coupling constant , called @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation length @xmath26 obeys the rg equation @xmath27 . as </S>",
    "<S> the correlation length is of dimension -1 we have @xmath28 and the previous relation can be put into the form @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the correlation length can be measured in a mc simulation , from which we can compute @xmath30 and compare with the rg @xmath31 function . </S>",
    "<S> let us emphasize that there are _ no adjustable parameters _ in this process . </S>",
    "<S> the difficulty lays in the mc simulations because the correlation length is a poorly self averaging quantity , from which we have to take the logarithm and then a derivative . </S>",
    "<S> this will amplify the noise , and therefore we will need to have outstanding statistics in the mc simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> having presented the basic idea , let us turn to the general case </S>",
    "<S> . for a model defined with a cut - off @xmath24 and a set of coupling constants @xmath32 , the ( bare ) @xmath5 points vertex functions satisfy a callan - zymanzik equation @xmath33      \\gamma^{(n)}(k_j ; g , \\lambda ) \\simeq 0\\ ] ] with @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is used to renormalize the field . </S>",
    "<S> the right hand side is not strictly zero but it depends on a power of the cut - off , and is neglected according to a text book argument . </S>",
    "<S> this relation can be put into the form @xmath37\\ln \\gamma^{(n)}$ ] . from the bare two points vertex function </S>",
    "<S> , we can compute the susceptibility @xmath38 and the correlation length @xmath39 . combining these equations </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a ( callan - zymanzik ) equation for the correlation length @xmath40\\xi= 0 $ ] and for the susceptibility @xmath41\\chi = 0 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the operator @xmath42 measures the dimension of the object it is applied on , and @xmath43 , @xmath44 . inserting in the above equation , we obtain our starting relation @xmath45 for a model with one coupling constant @xmath25 , this becomes @xmath46 for a model with two coupling constants @xmath25 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath47 , we obtain for the correlation length @xmath48 in these relations , the left hand side can be computed with the rg , and the right hand side can be measured by mc simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now define the nl@xmath0ms we are working with . </S>",
    "<S> the space is a square lattice of size @xmath49 , with periodic boundary conditions . on each site @xmath50 of the lattice </S>",
    "<S> , there is a field @xmath51 with values in a manifold . </S>",
    "<S> the first set of models is the stiefel model @xmath52 , corresponding to the group @xmath13 , the subgroup @xmath53 and the manifold @xmath54 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the field @xmath55 is a @xmath56 matrix , with the constraint @xmath57{1.07ex}{.1ex }      \\hspace{-.7ex}\\rule[1.44ex]{.4ex}{.06ex}\\hspace{.2ex}}_p$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the field can also be viewed as @xmath58 orthonormal @xmath5-components vectors @xmath59 , or as a @xmath58 frame in @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian is @xmath61 and the sum is over each link of the lattice . for @xmath62 , </S>",
    "<S> this is just the @xmath5-components heisenberg model @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> let us note the special cases @xmath64 and @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> we will also use the @xmath66 chiral model , corresponding to @xmath67 , but where the field obeys the supplementary constraint @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the second set of models is the grassmann @xmath69 model , corresponding to the group @xmath13 and the subgroup @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> the field is a @xmath5-components unit vector , and the hamiltonian is @xmath71 we made extensive mc simulations for all models with a manifold of dimension @xmath72 , namely @xmath73 ( or x - y model ) , @xmath74 , and of dimension @xmath75 , namely @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> we also made simulations for the @xmath80 model @xmath81 .    </S>",
    "<S> there exists an isomorphism between the manifolds @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian are however different , except for the @xmath77 model which can be mapped into the @xmath66 chiral model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are also the _ local _ isomorphisms between the manifolds @xmath83 and @xmath84 . concerning the global properties , the homotopy groups are @xmath85 ( boundary defect or domain walls ) , @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( point defects ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the manifolds @xmath76 and @xmath81 , the first homotopy groups @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are trivial ( no topological defects of any kind , including instanton ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now turn to the rg @xmath1 function for these models . for the @xmath4 models , we have the 5 loops results of wegner @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as the manifolds @xmath69 are locally identical to @xmath4 , the models have an identical @xmath1 function ( at all order ) , with the following relation between the temperatures @xmath91 . for the @xmath92 model , as the low temperature continuum limit neglects the two sheets of @xmath93 , it is identical to the @xmath66 chiral model , and hence , via the previously mentioned mapping , to the @xmath77 model . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the @xmath1 function is the @xmath76 @xmath1 function ( again , at all order ) , with the relation @xmath94 . for the @xmath95 models , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 functions have been computed by various authors @xcite and @xcite where the computations are more detailed . in the continuum limit </S>",
    "<S> , the action can be parametrized as @xmath96                                 \\ ] ] with the two coupling constants @xmath25 and @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the bare models correspond to @xmath97 . at one loop order , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 functions in @xmath17 are @xmath98 for @xmath3 , a trajectory of the flow possesses the invariant @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> then , we can integrate by the method of characteristics the flow equation and the differential equation for @xmath100 . with the value @xmath97 corresponding to the bare @xmath95 models , we obtain @xmath101 by comparing eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ beta_v_n2 ] ) with eq.([beta_t_alpha ] ) , we see that the term @xmath102 changes only the proportionality constant in @xmath31 . for @xmath103 , we have computed the above function at 2 loops order . in the domain of temperature </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in , the two loops correction is of order @xmath104% and therefore can be neglected . for the @xmath76 model , in the range of correlation length accessible to mc simulations , </S>",
    "<S> the 5 loops result gives a correction of order 10% over the one loop result . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , for the @xmath77 and @xmath92 models , the 5 loops @xmath1 function gives a correction of order 2% . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the lowest order @xmath1 function is already a good estimate for all models .    </S>",
    "<S> the monte carlo program has already been described in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> briefly , we use the ferrenberg - swendsen multi - histograms method @xcite and a cluster update algorithm @xcite , eventually biased according to @xcite . the correlation length is computed based on the small @xmath105 behavior of the fourier transformed two points green function @xmath106 . from the histograms , we get an estimate for @xmath107 from which we compute @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> let us emphasize again that we need very good statistics in order to obtain a satisfactory estimate for this last quantity . </S>",
    "<S> the total computation time for the present simulations is within the range of several years on a typical risc workstation . </S>",
    "<S> the largest size for which we can attain good enough statistics is typically @xmath109 . for the renormalization of the field @xmath110 </S>",
    "<S> , we can obtain a rough estimate , but our statistics are still insufficient to iron out the wrinkles on the curves . </S>",
    "<S> finally , even with a cluster update , the autocorrelation time grows badly around the transition .    </S>",
    "<S> due to a lack of space , we can present the graphical results for only three representative models ( by `` representative '' we mean that the @xmath1 functions look similar ) . </S>",
    "<S> let us emphasize that there are no adjustable parameters in these results , neither in the mc measurements nor in the theoretical rg @xmath1 functions . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 presents the results for the @xmath81 model , and is also representative of the @xmath76 model . </S>",
    "<S> the low temperature asymptotic regime is entered for correlation length of order @xmath111 , and the measured and computed @xmath1 functions match nicely . to the best of our knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> this is the first check of the @xmath2 rg idea for a model different from the heisenberg model . in the @xmath81 and @xmath76 models , </S>",
    "<S> there are no topological defects .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 presents the results for the @xmath77 model and is also representative of the @xmath112 and @xmath9 model . </S>",
    "<S> there we can see the clear discrepancy between the rg prediction and the mc measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the measured @xmath1 function goes even below the rg prediction , a disturbing fact ( although it does not violate any known rigorous bound ) . </S>",
    "<S> more disturbing is the fact that for @xmath113 , the equivalent @xmath76 temperature is @xmath114 , a temperature way inside the asymptotic regime with a correlation length of order @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> this series of models @xmath77 , @xmath112 and @xmath9 contains point defects as @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for the @xmath112 model used to describe frustrated antiferromagnets , this should be a clear warning ( not to speak about the @xmath117 extrapolation @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 presents the results for the @xmath92 model , and is also representative of the @xmath118 model . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy between the rg and mc @xmath1 function appears even more obviously . </S>",
    "<S> again , through the equivalence with @xmath76 in the continuous limit , the temperature @xmath119 ends up way inside the asymptotic region for the @xmath76 model , also with a correlation length of order @xmath120 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath118 and @xmath92 models have boundary defects as @xmath121 .    from our grouping </S>",
    "<S> , the key factor appears to be the various topological defects . in our mc simulations </S>",
    "<S> , we also measured the density of the different defects and the transition is always clearly related to them . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , there is a problem with the @xmath3 rg @xmath1 function for models with topological defects . in contradiction with the rg spin waves assumption , _ the global properties of the manifold </S>",
    "<S> do matter _ and a topological term seems to be a relevant direction for the rg flow . in fact , in view of the very different mc results for @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath92 , it is even surprising that , for the @xmath76 model , the asymptotic prediction does not fail for @xmath120 but works down to correlation lengths of order @xmath111 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now speculate about the possible scenario in two dimensions . from the above figures , it is very tempting to conclude to a phase transition at a finite temperature for all models with topological defects . for models with boundary defects @xmath122 , similarly to the ising model , we have a linear @xmath1 function and a power law diverging correlation length . </S>",
    "<S> a finite size scaling for the correlation length and specific heat gives @xmath123 for @xmath118 and @xmath124 for @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility for this family of models would be to have two transitions , the one at a higher temperature corresponding to the symmetry breaking @xmath125 . </S>",
    "<S> as the broken symmetry is discrete , it can be accompanied with long range order . for models with point defects </S>",
    "<S> @xmath116 , similarly to the x - y model , the @xmath1 functions are compatible with a kosterlitz - thouless behavior @xmath126 . </S>",
    "<S> let us emphasize that , for model with topological defects , phase transitions at a finite temperature are completely compatible with a finite size scaling analysis of the data . in contradistinction , the above rg predictions are consistent with the simulation for models with trivial topologies , but clearly ruled out for model with topological defects . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the mc simulations and finite size scaling are always powerless against arguments of the kind : for a correlation length of order @xmath127 ( or @xmath128 ) there is a crossover to the predicted rg asymptotic behavior . </S>",
    "<S> what is missing in order to draw a firmer conclusion is a theoretical basis . </S>",
    "<S> we would like for example to have a modification of the villain mapping for models with curvature . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to build an energy - entropy argument for a pair of point defects , but it seems difficult to turn this simple argument into a good approximation . for a model believed to be in the same universality class as the @xmath112 model , from an energy - entropy argument and from mc simulation , kawamura and </S>",
    "<S> miyashita @xcite already proposed a phase transition at a finite temperature . beside possibly dangerous analogies with the x - y model , </S>",
    "<S> only the large @xmath5-limit for @xmath129 concludes to a ( first order ) transition at a finite temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> caracciolo _ </S>",
    "<S> et all _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , studying a mixed @xmath130 model , concluded also that the usual rg computation does not describe the @xmath77 model and proposed some interesting alternatives , although still favoring a transition at @xmath131 for the pure @xmath77 model . </S>",
    "<S> another possible scenario would be that the naive power counting used to compute the relevance of various term is valid only very close to @xmath132 . at higher temperature , </S>",
    "<S> the present results indicate that the least irrelevant terms are the one related to topological defects </S>",
    "<S> .    simply stated , in the range of temperatures accessible to mc simulations and by using finite size scaling , our data for all models with topological defects are very well described by a phase transition at a finite temperature .    </S>",
