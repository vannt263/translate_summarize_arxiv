    "in the last decades , diverse questions of social dynamics have been tackled by means of statistical physics techniques .",
    "in fact , simple models allow to simulate and understand real problems such as elections , spread of information , vehicle traffic or pedestrian evacuation , amongst many others @xcite . as a feedback , these issues are attractive to physicists because of the occurrence of order - disorder transitions , scaling and universality , among other typical features of physical systems .",
    "more recently , due to the emergence and popularization of social networks like facebook and twitter , as means of information dissemination , there is a growing interest in the study of rumor and information spreading in complex networks . for this purpose , a large diversity of models",
    "have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the majority of these models are based on the standard ones of epidemic spreading like si , sis , sir and their variants @xcite .",
    "the paradigmatic model of rumor spreading is the daley - kendal ( dk ) model @xcite , that is conceptually similar to the sir model .",
    "the population is divided into three distinct states , namely spreaders , ignorants and stiflers .",
    "the spreaders are agents that are transmitting the rumor through the population , the ignorants do not know the rumor and , consequently , they are not spreading , and finally the stiflers are those individuals who know the rumor but have lost interest in diffusing it .",
    "the transitions between states are given by stochastic rules in the same way as in epidemic models .",
    "many extensions of the dk model were studied by the consideration of random , scale - free @xcite and small - world @xcite networks for the contact among individuals , two different kinds of rumors spreading over the network @xcite , new classes of individuals @xcite , effects of media @xcite , remembering and loss of memory @xcite , impact of human activities @xcite , among others .    our present motivation is to investigate some of the mechanisms involved in the adoption of innovations , new ideas or technologies .",
    "this issue may have practical applications such as in marketing strategies and have already been target of recent studies @xcite .",
    "we focus on the spreading of information of the kind that induces the adoption of a new product or idea .",
    "although , for practical purposes , one has primarily in mind the promotion of new goods introduced in the market , our proposal may also apply , for instance , to political propaganda .",
    "for that goal we consider a dynamics of information spreading inspired on the sis epidemic model .",
    "each agent can be in one of two possible states , namely , @xmath2 ( spreader ) or @xmath3 ( restrained ) .",
    "the individuals in state @xmath2 are those spreading the information through the network , whereas the agents in the state @xmath3 are not transmitting it even if they are aware of the information .",
    "notice that for marketing purposes , it is important that the agents become enthusiastic transmitters and not only that they know or adopt the technology .",
    "agents initially in state @xmath3 do not have the knowledge .",
    "when such an agent is put into contact with a new technology , product or ideology , by interaction with spreaders , the agent becomes with rate @xmath4 an enthusiastic adopter or spreader , trying in turn to convince the neighbors in the network of contacts ( friends , relatives , etc . ) to adopt the innovation .",
    "we denote this state as @xmath2 .",
    "frequently , this enthusiasm is transient and , after some time period , the agent spontaneously decays to the state @xmath3 with rate @xmath5 , where even though the agent may know or use the technology , he / she does not propagate it .",
    "also this state is not permanent and the agent could become again a spreader , however , with a reduced transition rate . to take this fact into account , we propose that , once the individual decays to state @xmath3 , his / her `` contagion '' rate @xmath4 decreases as @xmath6 , with @xmath7 .",
    "it reflects the fact that individuals tend to become more and more resistant to spread the information . nonetheless , the reduction of the `` infection '' rate occurs only a limited number @xmath1 of times .    both parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , can be either uniform , i.e. , equal for all individuals , or vary from one individual to another .",
    "in this work we will study the effect of the aging of transition rates on the phase diagram of the model .",
    "moreover , we will show the crucial role of heterogeneities on the critical behavior and its consequences for information spreading .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the general formulation of the model and define its microscopic rules .",
    "the analytical and numerical results of four distinct cases analyzed are discussed in section iii .",
    "section iv contains the conclusions and final remarks .",
    "we have considered a dynamics of information spreading based on the sis epidemic model , where each agent can be in one of two possible states . in our case ,",
    "@xmath2 ( spreader ) or @xmath3 ( restrained ) .",
    "the microscopic rules , based on a variant of the sis model with aging effects @xcite , are the following :    1 .",
    "each individual @xmath8 in the @xmath2 state at time @xmath9 becomes @xmath3 in the next time step @xmath10 with probability @xmath5 ; 2 .",
    "each individual @xmath8 in the @xmath3 state at time @xmath9 becomes @xmath2 in the next time step @xmath10 with probability @xmath11 if it has at least one neighbor in the @xmath2 state ; 3 .",
    "each individual @xmath8 starts the dynamics with @xmath12 .",
    "after each transition @xmath13 , the spreading probability @xmath14 is updated according to @xmath15 where , for all @xmath8 , @xmath16 is the factor of reduction of the spreading rate ( or probability of spreading within a time unit ) .",
    "4 .   in addition ,",
    "the update given by eq .",
    "( [ lambda_j ] ) occurs a maximal number @xmath17 of times for each individual @xmath8 .",
    "let us recall that , initially , the individuals in the @xmath3 state do not know the information .",
    "actually , this would correspond to a third state ( ignorant agent ) , but this state only occurs at the beginning of the dynamics and it is not attainable later on , as soon as oblivion is not taken into account .",
    "after a contact with an agent @xmath2 ( spreader ) , an individual @xmath8 in state @xmath3 comes to know the information , hence becoming @xmath2 , with probability @xmath14 ( this probability is , of course , equal for all individuals at @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath19 for all @xmath8 ) .",
    "after that , the individuals will not forget the information , but they can spread it or not . in standard models of rumor spreading , the ignorants do not spread the rumor because they do not know it , while the stiflers know the rumor but they do not transmit it . in comparison with the standard states considered in rumor models , the agents in the @xmath3 state can be identified with ignorants only at the beginning , when they do not have acquired the knowledge yet , while they can be identified with stiflers after each transition @xmath20 , in which case they do have the knowledge . moreover , concerning the transition rules in standard models , stiflers do not become spreaders again , unlike in our model .",
    "notice , from our rules , that the spreading probabilities are heterogeneous , varying from one individual to another .",
    "each agent @xmath8 who stops spreading the information through the network ( restrained ) may become a spreader again , but the probability with which this event occurs decreases with time , depending on the agent intrinsic traits , given by ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "after each transition @xmath13 , the spreading probability of a given agent @xmath8 decreases , up to a maximal number of times @xmath22 , then , in the next time step , it will be more difficult for the contacts of the individual @xmath8 to `` persuade '' him / her to spread the information again .",
    "we have investigated the model on top of an erds - renyi ( er ) network with size @xmath23 and poissonian degree distribution @xmath24 . in this case , we have computed information spreading only in the largest connected component , i.e. , the giant cluster .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we have considered networks with @xmath25 , for which the probability that a given node belongs to the giant cluster is approximately given by @xmath26 in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "we will analyze four distinct cases : ( i ) uniform parameters , i.e. , @xmath27 and @xmath28 for all individuals @xmath8 ; ( ii ) uniform @xmath0 and random @xmath1 ; ( iii ) random @xmath0 and uniform @xmath1 , and finally ( iv ) random @xmath0 and random @xmath1 .",
    "when randomness is considered , the uniform probability distribution is used to generate the parameters .",
    "in this case , we have @xmath27 and @xmath28 for each individual @xmath8 .",
    "however , there is a certain degree of heterogeneity in the system due to the distinct histories of the spreading rates @xmath14 . following the mean - field approach used to treat epidemic models @xcite ,",
    "one obtains the analytical solution of the model .",
    "initially , let us define @xmath29 as the number of spreaders that have performed the transition @xmath13 exactly @xmath30 times , where @xmath30 can take the values @xmath31 .",
    "observe that these agents have spreading rates @xmath32 . at mean - field level",
    ", one can assume that after a long time ( but before attaining the steady state ) all individuals will be in either one of two states @xcite , namely , either @xmath33 or @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "thus , the only relevant equation to the time evolution of the system is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the density of spreaders in the state @xmath33 , @xmath36 and we have used the normalization condition @xmath37 . due to the poisson distribution of er graphs , in eq .",

    "this result is easily understood : if we allow the spreading probabilities to decrease a large number of times , the probability of the restrained individuals to become spreaders becomes very small , and it is improbable that the information will remain being spread over the network .",

    ", one can observe that there is a phase transition even for @xmath61 , which turns the spreading phase ( above the dashed curve in fig .",

    "[ fig3 ] ( full line ) the frontier of the uniform case for @xmath47 , corresponding to the mean value of @xmath22 ) .",
    "in other words , the transition is not eliminated even for @xmath61 .",

    "decrease fast , but there are some individuals for which this decrease occurs a small number of times ( e.g. for @xmath62 ) or does not occur at all ( for @xmath63 ) .",

    "that in the limiting case @xmath61 , the individuals @xmath8 with @xmath65 ( that are around @xmath66 of the population ) keep their spreading rates equal to the initial value , i.e. , they have @xmath19 at all time steps .",

    "in other words , we have an additional heterogeneity in the population due to the individual rate of decrease of the spreading probability , i.e. , each agent @xmath8 has a decreasing rate @xmath70 that is a real number generated from a uniform distribution in the range @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "again , we have followed the usual procedure and we have analyzed the time evolution of the density of spreaders @xmath55 . in the present formulation , as @xmath0 is random , we have plotted the phase diagram in the plane @xmath45 versus @xmath1 .",
    "one can observe in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that the region above the curve , for which the information is continuously spread across the network , decreases for increasing values of @xmath1 . in fact , if we increase @xmath1 , the final spreading rates @xmath36 are small even if @xmath72 , and in this case it is difficult for the restrained individuals to become spreaders again .",
    "if we plot the data in the log - log scale , one case see that the quantities are related by the power law @xmath68 , with @xmath69 ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .      in this case",
    ", we have the more heterogeneous instance where both parameters are random : @xmath0 is uniformly distributed in the range @xmath71 $ ] and @xmath1 is an integer number uniformly distributed in the range @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "although in this case there is no phase diagram to plot , we can discuss the criticality of the model at the single transition point @xmath42 .",
    "our numerical estimate is @xmath73 . in other words , for @xmath74",
    "the information is permanently disseminated through the network by a finite fraction of the population .",
    "notice that the threshold is relatively small .",
    "thus , the enhanced diversity of spreading probabilities @xmath14 in the population favors the propagation of information .",
    "in this work we have studied a model of information spreading on complex networks .",
    "the model is based on the sis epidemic model , but the `` infection '' or spreading rates vary with time , decaying with the number of `` reinfections '' .",
    "this decay is controlled by two parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and we have considered that they can be either uniform or random .",
    "these features make the population heterogeneous , since the agents may have distinct rates of transition between the two possible states , namely , spreader ( s ) or restrained ( r ) .",
    "we solved the model analytically in its simplest formulation , for constant @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in this case , the critical spreading rates are given by @xmath75 , where @xmath45 is the initial probability ( at @xmath18 ) of the transition @xmath76 , @xmath5 is the probability of the transition @xmath13 and @xmath46 is the average degree of the random network .",
    "the critical rates define frontiers ( for different values of @xmath1 ) in the plane @xmath45 versus @xmath0 that separate a phase where the information stops being spread ( for @xmath53 ) and a phase where a certain fraction of the population remains spreading the information ( for @xmath54 ) .",
    "this result suggests that networks with large average degree favor the spreading of information , as well as populations with a small capacity to decrease the spreading rates ( i.e. , small @xmath1 ) , as intuitively expected .",
    "all analytical results were confirmed by monte carlo simulations .    in the case where one ( or both ) of the parameters",
    "@xmath0 or @xmath1 is ( are ) random , the model was analyzed only through numerical simulations . for random @xmath1 and",
    "fixed @xmath0 , we have observed that information spreading is favored and thus the spreading phase , where the information is permanently disseminated through the network by a finite fraction of the population , is larger than in the uniform case . for random @xmath0 and fixed @xmath1",
    "the two phases are of comparable size , and the power law @xmath68 , with @xmath69 arises .",
    "finally , in the case of both parameters being heterogeneous in the population , we have found the transition at @xmath77 .",
    "thus , one can conclude that the more heterogeneous the population is , more the information spreading is favored .",
    "in other words , population diversity is an interesting feature to be taken into account in models of information / rumor spreading .",
    "let us remark that , due to the correspondence between the present model and the sis model with aging , our results can be immediately applied to the latter model .",
    "in that case , diversity would be malefic , since disease propagation will be favored .",
    "the authors are grateful to jose fernando mendes for having provided the computational resources of the group of complex systems and random networks ( gnet ) of the aveiro university , portugal , where the simulations were performed .",
