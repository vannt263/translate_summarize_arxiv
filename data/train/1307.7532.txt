    "note that both @xmath215 and @xmath216 correspond to the `` unperturbed '' system at potential @xmath218 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath218 is strong enough to lift the degeneracy of the lowest lb , justifying the use of non degenerate perturbation theory .",
    "it is expected that the contribution from localized states will be much smaller than that of the extended ones , and therefore , assuming that the states @xmath86 are extended and belong to higher lb .",
    "since @xmath86 is located around the lb center , there are more states whose energies are above @xmath86 than those below @xmath86 .",
    "thus , more terms in the sum are negative , and @xmath219 , implying anti - levitation . according to eq . , the shift should be proportional to @xmath220 .",
    "this is indeed consistent with our numerical data points that agree with quadratic fits @xmath221 ( dashed lines in fig .",

    "the disappearance of the lowest extended state at very small magnetic field indicates a transition between the iqhe state on the lowest lb and an anderson insulator .    based on our analysis pertaining to the lowest lb , fig .",
    "[ pb ] displays a phase diagram in the @xmath3 plane where the boundary between the integer quantum hall liquid and anderson insulator is marked . in principle",

    "our phase diagram is consistent with the experimental one and extends it to the lowest lb .",
