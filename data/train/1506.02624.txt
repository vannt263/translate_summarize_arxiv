    "the neutrinos decay scenario has been early proposed as an explanation of the solar neutrinos problem@xcite .",
    "although the neutrinos decay through radiative processes is well constrained @xcite , the lifetime limits for non - radiative channels are very weak .",
    "generally researchers focused their attention to non - radiative processes of the kind @xmath0 , where neutrinos decay into possibly detectable neutrinos ( or antineutrinos ) plus truly invisible particles , @xmath1 , e.g. , light scalar or pseudoscalar bosons .",
    "as an example , the neutrino decay can take place through the coupling of the neutrino to a very light or massless particle , such as a majoron , which is also responsible for spontaneous neutrino mass generation @xcite .    in general",
    ", considering a neutrinos source , decay could deplete the flux of neutrinos by the factor , @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the masses and lifetime of the @xmath5-th neutrino , subject to decay , @xmath6 is their energy and @xmath7 is the time since production . as a consequence , the sensitivity to the unknown ratio @xmath8 changes for different distances and energies .",
    "actually the strongest reliable limit for non - radiative processes and for hierarchical masses , namely @xmath9 s / ev , is obtained by the non - observation of solar electron antineutrinos in kamland @xcite .",
    "this limit can be in principle improved by several order of magnitude by using the high energy cosmic neutrinos observed in detectors such as icecube @xcite .",
    "this intriguing possibility became more interesting on the light of the recent search for high energy starting events ( hese ) in icecube detector that provided the first evidence for high - energy cosmic neutrinos@xcite . in three year of data taking @xcite , 37 events with deposited energies above 30 tev were observed , relative to an expected background of @xmath10 cosmic ray muon events and @xmath115.9 atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "recently , palladino _",
    "et al._@xcite have discussed the compatibility of these data with the hypothesis of cosmic origin . in order to reduce the background contamination ,",
    "authors have considered the subset of events with deposited energy above 60 tev . using the additional information provided by muon neutrinos passing through the earth ,",
    "they show that the observed track - to - shower ratio matches expectations for neutrinos of cosmic origin .        in this letter , we discuss the impact of the non - radiative neutrino decay scenario on the expected icecube signal in term of the track - to - shower ratio .",
    "more precisely , considering the actual uncertainties on oscillation parameters , mass hierarchy and production mechanisms ; we use the observed events to constrain the hypothesis of neutrinos decay . as a remarkable result",
    ", we show that the subset of data with energy above 60 tev excludes the possibility of a neutrinos decay at the 1 sigma level of significance for both neutrino mass hierarchies .",
    "to maximize the effect of neutrino decay , we consider the phenomelogy of a generic neutrinos decay and we assume that decays are always complete ( i.e. , that the exponential factors vanish ) .",
    "this last assumption is reasonable for cosmic sources considering that @xmath12 and @xmath13 , namely @xmath14 where we used @xmath15 .",
    "we call this hypothesis _ complete decay scenario_. in this case , the flux of neutrinos of flavor @xmath16 expected to the earth is : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the neutrino mixing matrix and the sum only involves stable mass eigenstates . following @xcite , we introduce the _ flavor fractions at earth _ ( i.e. , in the detection point ) , defined as : @xmath19 in term of this quantity the relation between the flavor ratios at earth and the ones at source becomes : @xmath20 where the indeces @xmath21 and @xmath22 run over stable mass eigenstates and active flavors , respectively .",
    "the expression in eq.([fractionnh ] ) also holds in the case where sterile neutrino states are included .",
    "different production mechanisms generate a different initial flavor content at the source @xmath23 .",
    "for example the most studied production processes are : + @xmath24 for @xmath25 decay ; + @xmath26 for _ charmed mesons _",
    "decay ; + @xmath27 for @xmath28 decay of _ neutrons _ ; + @xmath29 for @xmath25 decay with _ damped muons_. + for cosmic neutrinos , without neutrino decay processes , the final flavor ratios are expected to be very near to @xmath30 , independently on the specific production mechanism @xcite . on the other hand , turning on the `` invisible '' decay process discussed above , the flavor ratios at the earth change dramatically @xcite . in the case of only one stable mass eigenstate @xmath21 and for the standard scenario with three actives neutrinos , the expression of eq.([fractionnh ] ) becomes @xmath31 where the sensitivity to the different production mechanisms has disappeared .",
    "the simplified expression in eq.([simp ] ) is due to the fact that only one mass eigenstate is stable and all the others have had time to decay , so that the universe is populated only by neutrinos in the state of mass @xmath21 and obviously the content of flavor @xmath16 expected to the detector is @xmath32 .    assuming normal mass hierarchy , the simplest case is to consider that both @xmath33 and @xmath34 decay , so that only the lightest eigenstate @xmath35 survives . in this case",
    "the final flavor ratios are expected to be @xmath36 . for inverted mass hierarchy ,",
    "a similar expression holds but the stable state in this case is @xmath33 , i.e. the final flavor ratios are expected to be @xmath37 . in order to evaluate these ratios , we used the best - fit values for the oscillation parameters reported in @xcite .",
    "to compare the expectations with the data collected by icecube we need to convert the flavor neutrino ratio expected to the earth in the corresponding observable quantity , i.e. the track - to - shower ratio including the detector response .",
    "indeed , by exploiting the event topology , the flavor discrimination is possible , in principle , in icecube detector .",
    "the hese data collected by icecube during @xmath38 days , encompass two different topologies : ` shower ' topology , that includes neutral current ( nc ) interactions of all neutrino flavors and charged current ( cc ) interactions of @xmath39 and @xmath40 ; ` track ' topology produced by cc interactions of @xmath41 .",
    "thus the track - to - shower ratio is the observable quantity that is most directly related to the flavor ratio at the earth as discussed in several recent papers @xcite .",
    "in particular palladino _",
    "et al._@xcite described the way to calculate the number of showers @xmath42 and tracks @xmath43 in the icecube detector for an isotropic flux @xmath44 of neutrinos and antineutrinos described as @xmath45 where the factors @xmath46 are ( non - negative ) adimensional coefficients and @xmath47 is the spectral index . the number of showers and tracks can be obtained by using the following equations : @xmath48 where @xmath7 is the time of exposure and the coefficients @xmath49 include the detector effective areas @xmath50@xcite and the energy dependence of the fluxes .",
    "the extra factor @xmath51 in eq.([ntandns ] ) accounts for the fraction of the effective area @xmath52 giving tracks , this fraction is about @xmath53 and mildly dependent on energy as discussed in @xcite .",
    "so that , the following useful expression to obtain the track - to - shower ratio from the final neutrino flavor ratios can be obtained generally : @xmath54 in which @xmath55 are given , with good approximation , by : @xmath56 in the context of neutrino decay scenario described above and fixing the spectral index @xmath57 , we have that for normal mass hierarchy eq.([ntoverns ] ) becomes : @xmath58 where the index @xmath21 indicates the stable mass eigenstate . for normal mass hierarchy @xmath59 and substituting the best - fit values of the oscillation parameters we obtain @xmath60 .",
    "for inverted mass hierarchy @xmath61 and this fraction becomes @xmath62 .",
    "the impact of the spectral index of neutrino spectrum is not so dramatic , in fact if we consider a greater slope , like @xmath63 , these number become @xmath64 and @xmath65 . instead , a much more important contribution is given by uncertainties on neutrino oscillations parameters , that allow these numbers to fluctuate in a more large interval . to correctly account for these uncertainties we construct likelihood distributions of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 from the @xmath70 profiles given by @xcite .",
    "namely , we assume that the probability distributions of each parameter are provided by @xmath71 .",
    "then , we combine the various likelihood functions assuming negligible correlations and we determine the probability distributions of @xmath72 by montecarlo extraction of the oscillation parameters . the resulting probability density ( pd ) distributions are reported in fig.([fig1 ] ) with a color code blue ( resp .",
    "red ) for normal ( resp .",
    "inverted ) mass hierachy .",
    "the predicted pds can be compared with the distribution of the track - to - shower ratio preferred by the icecube data . in the first column of tab .",
    "( [ datatable ] ) we report the events observed by icecube in the hese data set @xcite with a deposited energy above 60 tev . we devided the events by topology and we includ , in brackets , the respective number of estimated background events due to atmospheric neutrinos and muons .",
    "the number of tracks @xmath43 and showers @xmath42 which have to be ascribed to extraterrestrial sources can be estimated from the poisson likelihood functions : @xmath73 where @xmath74 and the index @xmath75 is used to refer to track and shower events and @xmath76 are the observed events .",
    "we are assuming that the prompt atmospheric neutrinos give negligible contributions , as it required by the spectral and arrival angles distributions of icecube events .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ datatable ]    a completely equivalent and independent information can be obtained by the recently released icecube data on passing muons @xcite , as already done by palladino et al . in @xcite . in the assumption of @xmath77 neutrino spectrum for the passing muons",
    ", the flux normalization corresponds to @xmath78 and taking into account the equivalence between @xmath79 and @xmath80 expressed by the following equation ( in which @xmath7 is the exposure time ) : @xmath81 we can include also this information in our analysis by constructing a combined likelihood , given by the product of the 2 poisson likelihoods for @xmath43 and @xmath42 and of the gaussian likelihood for @xmath79 ( i.e. @xmath80 ) . then we extract the bounds on the track-to.shower ratios of events ascribed to cosmic neutrinos by marginalizing with respect to the total number of events .",
    "we obtain : @xmath82 } \\nonumber \\label{1}\\ ] ] where the error was obtained by integrating out symmetrically @xmath83 on both sides of the @xmath72 distribution using a confidence level @xmath84 .",
    "the normalized likelihood distribution of the hese data is reported in fig.([fig1 ] ) with a black line and the 1 sigma region is also indicated to easily see its sovrapposition with the predicted pds in the neutrino decay scenario .",
    "repeating the analysis with 4 years data , under the hypothesis that the background is simply proportional to the exposure time , we found a new range given by : @xmath85 } \\nonumber \\label{2}\\ ] ] we can notice that this interval is compatible with that found for the 3 year@xcite also if the uncertainties are slightly smaller with new data ; the track - to - shower of 4 years is more favorable for pions decay at the source , respect to that obtained with 3 years data . in conclusion , it is important to remark that the non - radiative neutrino decays are excluded at least at 1 sigma for both neutrino hierarchies and for both sets of observed data .",
    "moreover these are general considerations and have a poor dependence from the slope of the spectrum of neutrinos .",
