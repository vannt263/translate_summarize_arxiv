    "free probability ( see e.g.  @xcite ) is a branch of operator algebras that was invented by voiculescu for the purpose of studying properties of free group factors .",
    "later voiculescu discovered in @xcite that free probability has also an application to the behavior of eigenvalues of non - commutative polynomials in independent large random matrices .",
    "this is one of the most striking success of free probability .    when applying free probability to random matrices , the standard assumption is that a family of hermitian matrices @xmath0 has a _ ( joint ) limiting distribution _ as @xmath1 , meaning that for any non - commutative @xmath2-polynomial @xmath3 in @xmath4 variables , @xmath5 admits a finite limit as @xmath1 where @xmath6 is the normalized trace such that @xmath7 .",
    "then voiculescu s result @xcite ( see also @xcite ) states that if @xmath8 is a haar unitary random matrix , then with probability one , the enlarged family @xmath9 also has a joint limiting distribution almost surely as @xmath1 , and in the limit , @xmath8 becomes free from @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , haagerup - thorbjrnsen @xcite , male @xcite and collins - male @xcite obtained versions of voiculescu s results in the context of operator norm convergence .",
    "what they proved is that the family of matrices @xmath9 admits a _ strong ( joint ) limiting distribution _ as @xmath1 , which means that it has a joint limiting distribution as stated before , and in addition , for any non - commutative self - adjoint @xmath2-polynomial @xmath3 in @xmath11 non - commuting variables , the random matrix @xmath12 has no _ outliers _ , i.e.  no eigenvalues outside the limiting support of the spectrum . before the above results in free probability ,",
    "several ` single random matrix models ' were known to have strong limiting distributions ; for example , this is the case for wigner matrices under some assumptions , and in particular for gaussian unitary ensembles ( gue ) and wishart matrices ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.1.22 and bibliographical notes ) ) .    on the other hand , in the last 10 years",
    ", random matrix models that do not have strong limiting distributions have become fashionable .",
    "the literature is abundant .",
    "we refer for examples to @xcite and in particular to the pioneering work of baik - ben arous - pch @xcite and pch @xcite where outliers of finite rank deformations of wishart matrices and of gues have been studied , respectively .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate random matrix models similar to those studied in @xcite , but our models admit _ purely discrete spectra _ when the dimension tends to infinity .",
    "in other words , our model has , as a limiting spectrum , the eigenvalues of a selfadjoint compact operator on a hilbert space .",
    "the precise definition of our model is as follows . for simplicity ,",
    "the dependence on @xmath13 being dropped , let @xmath14 be a family of @xmath15 deterministic matrices which has a limiting joint distribution with respect to the _ non - normalized trace _",
    "@xmath16 , i.e.  for any non - commutative @xmath2-polynomial @xmath3 without a constant term , the following limit exists : _",
    "n _ n(p(a_1 ,  , a_k ) ) . let @xmath17 be a family of @xmath15 deterministic matrices which has a limiting joint distribution with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath18 be an @xmath15 haar unitary ( we can treat several independent haar unitaries , but for now we restrict to a single haar unitary ) .",
    "we investigate the limiting eigenvalues of [ model ] p(a_1 ,  , a_k , u b_1 u^ * ,  , u b_u^ * ) , where @xmath3 is a selfadjoint non - commutative @xmath2-polynomial @xmath19 satisfying @xmath20 .",
    "we show that the eigenvalues of our model converge pointwise to deterministic eigenvalues of a compact operator almost surely .",
    "we also compute the limiting eigenvalues explicitly in terms of the limiting joint distributions of @xmath21 and of @xmath22 for several polynomials @xmath3 including _",
    "i=1^k x_i y_i x_i^ * , _ i=1^k y_i x_i y_i^*,x y + y x , ( x y -y x ) .",
    "our model is closely related to the recent work of shlyakhtenko where asymptotic infinitesimal freeness was proved for @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we strengthen this result with a self - contained proof , and then show the almost sure asymptotic convergence .",
    "shlyakhtenko s work is devoted to the study of spiked models where both discrete spectra and continuous spectra appear , studied by baik - ben arous - pch @xcite , pch @xcite and others . on the other hand ,",
    "our research is devoted to purely discrete spectra . in our discrete spectrum model , we are able to handle completely general polynomials of random matrices and can show the almost sure convergence of eigenvalues , while general polynomials are still difficult to treat if both continuous and discrete spectra are involved .    on methodology",
    ", our model needs a new method outside the standard techniques in free probability , since our model in distribution in the usual sense : _",
    "n _ n(p(a_1 ,  ,",
    "a_k , u b_1 u^ * ,  , u b_u^*)^p ) = 0,p . to analyze the discrete spectrum ,",
    "we develop the moment method with respect to the _ non - normalized trace _ @xmath16 .",
    "the most important point is that the convergence of moments with respect to @xmath16 as @xmath1 implies the pointwise convergence of eigenvalues . together with this moment method ,",
    "the _ weingarten calculus _ developed in free probability @xcite enables us to compute moments with respect to @xmath16 and prove the pointwise convergence of eigenvalues .",
    "when continuous and discrete spectra are mixed , it is not obvious if our method can somehow be extended .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "after this introduction , section [ sec : cv - eigenvalues ] gathers preliminary materials in order to handle eigenvalue distributions of non - commutative random variables that are compact operators . in section [ sec : cyclic - monotone ]",
    "we introduce the notion , central to this paper , of _ cyclic monotone independence _ which is a special case of infinitesimal freeness , in the framework of a non - commutative probability space with a tracial weight .",
    "section [ sec : rmt ] contains the main result : almost sure asymptotic cyclic monotone independence .",
    "finally , section [ sec5 ] provides examples and applications .",
