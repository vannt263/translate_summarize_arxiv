    "radiation damage in solids from collision cascades formed during high - energy particle irradiation , ions or neutrons , is extremely costly and , perhaps , the single most complex and challenging technological problem facing nuclear material scientists , reactor designers , and regulatory agencies desiring long - lived engineering structures , low operational costs , and safety .",
    "the search for and development of materials with improved radiation damage tolerance requires a more or less complete understanding of defect production , transport , evolution , and recovery in complex alloy or composite systems that are undergoing irradiation and transitions far from equilibrium on picosecond time scales at the atomic level to decade - long microstructural and thermo - physical property changes as either structural or functional materials .",
    "these properties undergo unavoidable time- , temperature- , and fluence - dependent degradation and , usually , irreversible changes @xcite such that replacement or costly mitigation is required to satisfy operational safety concerns at critical fluence levels .",
    "there is a strong scientific and technological interest in studying and developing radiation damage tolerant materials .",
    "structural materials can achieve radiation damage tolerance via two basic mechanisms .",
    "some materials intrinsically have a damage tolerant crystal structure with high damage thresholds , such as sic in the zinc - blende structure , or they possess a high tolerance for atomic disorder as evidenced by certain oxides , such as disordered fluorites @xcite . unfortunately ,",
    "most metallic and structural alloys possess low damage tolerance from close - packed crystal structures that can accommodate a wide variety of low lying defect states and that have low damage thresholds .",
    "thus , they do not possess intrinsic damage tolerance , although bcc materials are more damage tolerant compared to fcc or hcp structures @xcite .",
    "the second basic mechanism relies on enhanced damage recovery mechanisms typically via increased recombination rates of radiation - induced defects at defect sinks within a material .",
    "these sink sites range from grain boundary denuded zones observed in many materials to engineered materials containing nano - spaced interfaces , including nano - featured ferritic alloys and nanolayered materials .",
    "the general concept of point defect recombination at internal interfaces is not a new idea but has achieved recent significance from work with oxide dispersion strengthened ( ods ) alloys @xcite , nano - featured alloys @xcite , and nano - layered composites @xcite specifically designed to achieve high strength and enhanced defect recombination at closely spaced sinks for vacancies and self - interstitials .",
    "capture and immobilization of helium ( he ) is also of keen interest for fusion reactor materials where he can be produced at levels approaching a few atomic percent @xcite .",
    "specifically , nanolayered materials based on dissimilar materials arranged in closely spaced layered structures with high interfacial areal fractions are considered developmental radiation tolerant materials .",
    "the specific details of the damage tolerance are still being studied and evaluated but it is considered that enhanced defect recombination at the dissimilar interfaces is occurring that reduces the overall damage accumulation relative to bulk materials . however , some specific trends are noted and discussed in the literature , namely , that immiscible systems behave differently compared to miscible systems under irradiation @xcite .",
    "miscible systems , including al - ti reported here , intermix under irradiation and would not be expected to demonstrate radiation damage tolerance at high doses .",
    "immiscible systems are stable against mixing and do demonstrate enhanced radiation damage tolerance to some level of damage @xcite .",
    "with regard to mixing of layered materials , but not specifically nanolayered films , there are phenomenological models built on the assumption that the mixing occurs via interdiffusion during high - energy collision cascades at low temperatures where the ion beam supplies sufficient energy that a locally melted region develops ( thermal spike region ) and phase transitions are possible @xcite .",
    "these models and the thermodynamics of mixing can partly explain the improved damage tolerance of the immiscible systems compared to miscible ones .",
    "however , many collisions are lower in energy than considered for the interdiffusion mixing models and in this regime a systematic study of nanolayered materials and their response to radiation damage has been lacking . at lower energies we can partly avoid the complications of ion beam mixing and study more carefully the effects of displacement damage . in this respect",
    "we find that there has been a lack of theoretical studies in this regime and this paper focuses on this aspect of the problem for a specific layered system that can be arranged in atomic models in a wide variety of stable structures , namely , the al - ti system .",
    "we also include some preliminary he - ion implantation studies of sputtered nanolayered al - ti films that demonstrate agreement with the theoretical models studied here .",
    "the use of low energy he ion implantation to study ion beam mixing and radiation damage in nanolayered thin films is useful since he damage rates are reduced compared to heavy ions , the ranges are appropriate for thin films , and the effects of he accumulation are relatively easily observed compared to point defect clustering as a measure of radiation damage .",
    "it is understood that he bubble formation proceeds from vacancy ( v ) accumulation and he - v binding .",
    "thus , observing he bubbles is a surrogate for observing v clustering in these thin film materials .",
    "hchbauer et al .",
    "@xcite were the first to study he accumulation as bubbles in cu - nb nanolayered materials .",
    "they observed preferential he bubble formation at cu - nb interfaces and along columnar grain boundaries following 33 kev he implantation .",
    "demkowicz et al .",
    "@xcite concluded that he also accumulates along cu - nb interfaces and that these interfaces act as fast diffusing pathways for he escape during annealing .",
    "zhang et al .",
    "@xcite observed that he bubbles were not resolvable in cu - nb 2.5-nm layered foils , whereas identical 33 kev he implantation produced tem visible bubbles in pure cu , pure nb , and cu - nb 100-nm layered materials .",
    "this was assumed to be evidence that cu - nb 2.5-nm layered materials exhibited enhanced recombination of radiation - induced point defects and , thus , much smaller he bubbles , less than about 1 nm in diameter .",
    "zhernenkov et al .",
    "used neutron reflectometry to study he locations in implanted cu - nb foils and concluded that he was likely being stored as interstitial he in the dissimilar interfaces until a critical concentration was reached , after which he bubbles were formed @xcite .",
    "perhaps the best evidence comes from @xmath4he implantations and using nuclear reaction analysis ( nra ) to study he concentrations as a function of implantation depth together with tem to determine he concentrations where he bubbles form @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions were reached by bhattacharyya et al . using tem and nra to study @xmath4he - implanted cu - nb foils @xcite .",
    "interface structure appears to play a critical role in the amount of he that can be stored before bubbles form @xcite .",
    "recent md studies are consistent with this understanding and demonstrate atomic storage mechanisms for he in certain interfaces @xcite .",
    "however , once a critical concentration of he is reached then he bubbles can nucleate and grow in these layered materials just as in bulk metals .",
    "a key difference , though , is that he bubble morphologies and locations vary from layer to layer and , above a certain dose , appear to depend on some intrinsic property of the layer material rather than the interfaces @xcite .",
    "hattar et al .",
    "@xcite observed he bubbles in both the cu and nb layers of a cu - nb 5 to 6-nm layered foil after high doses of 33 kev he ion implantation at 763 k. however , he bubbles in the cu layers spanned the thickness of the entire layer and were approximately 5 to 6 nm in diameter , whereas he bubbles in the nb layers were about 1 to 2 nm in diameter .",
    "similar observations of he bubble suppression compared to bulk or 100-nm layered materials are observed in cu - v nanolayered foils @xcite and in cu - mo nanolayered foils @xcite , where a slight size difference between he bubbles in cu layers ( larger ) compared to mo layers was noted .",
    "wei et al .",
    "@xcite observed bubble size differences in ag - v nanolayered materials somewhere between the cu - nb size differences and those observed for cu - v , with the larger bubbles contained in ag layers .",
    "nicely summarize dose effects in cu - v nanolayered systems and discuss he effects , radiation hardening , and both mixing and demixing effects observed in other systems @xcite .",
    "one trend that appears to be consistent in these nanolayered studies is the observation that a certain level of asymmetry develops with regard to he bubble morphologies at increased he doses .",
    "bubble sizes are non - uniform after a certain dose and the evidence is not clear that this asymmetry does not develop earlier in the radiation damage regime .",
    "helium storage at dissimilar interfaces does not destroy the symmetry of the system , although , asymmetric swelling amounts are often noted @xcite , along with asymmetric he bubble sizes @xcite .",
    "these become serious issues in dealing with nanolayered failure mechanisms from radiation damage , perhaps from delamination or other mechanical failures due to differential responses .",
    "one shortcoming in the current literature and that is addressed in this research is the lack of understanding of point defects in nanolayered systems at low energies where ion beam mixing and demixing effects do not occur readily .",
    "in particular , displacement thresholds have not been studied for any of these layered systems to help understand or predict if some part of the response asymmetry may be due to displacement threshold effects .",
    "there is no reason to expect that defect generation or fates are symmetric within nanolayered materials made up of dissimilar metals . under asymmetric defect generation",
    "the ability of the system to avoid damage accumulation via enhanced recombination may be compromised .",
    "one layer may accumulate an excess of one kind of point defect or defect cluster over time .",
    "the differential he bubble size observed in cu - nb suggests that this type of damage can not be overlooked or ignored .",
    "an analogy to the kirkendall effect and the resultant porosity and interface motion during interdiffusion of binary diffusion couples may be helpful .",
    "this study performs a series of md simulations in the al - ti system , which is one that has not been studied in terms of radiation damage response .",
    "the choice of this system was motivated by the availability of a high - quality eam potentials and by the flexibility of this system , although it is extremely reactive and miscible , to adopt a variety of possible interfaces , namely fcc - fcc at small size scales and fcc - hcp at larger size scales .",
    "in addition , this system is readily synthesized using magnetron sputtering . in a separate publication we set out a method and data for displacement thresholds for the al - ti nanolayered system and",
    "see systematic differences between computed thresholds for bulk metals and nanolayered metals .",
    "we make use of this information here but the research reported here studies the radiation response of the al - ti system arranged in a variety of possible structures .",
    "finally , we have some preliminary data on he - implanted al - ti layers using low energy he ions using a he ion microscope and with characterization in cross - section using fib and tem .",
    "as mentioned above , one motivation in choosing al - ti systems was the recent availability of the high quality al - ti embedded - atom ( eam ) potentials developed by zope _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the potentials were fitted to a large database of experimental as well as ab initio data .",
    "a comprehensive list of properties was reproduced accurately .",
    "those that are particularly important for radiation damage in multilayers include the vacancy formation and migration energies , elastic moduli , stacking fault energies , and the formation energy of various bulk phases .",
    "in addition , the potentials yielded accurate coefficients of thermal expansion . hence , isobaric - isothermal ( _ npt _ ) simulations can be performed . in order to use the potentials for simulating radiation damage , the short - range parts need modification to accurately model the highly repulsive interactions that dominate the early stages of collision cascades .",
    "the modification was applied to the pair interactions of the eam potentials .    for the short - range modification , ab initio energies of dimers al - al , al - ti and ti - ti at various bond lengths were calculated and used for fitting .",
    "vasp software was utilized to perform the first - principles calculations within the density - functional - theory ( dft ) formalism using plane - wave bases @xcite .",
    "accurate projector - augmented - wave pseudopotentials with perdew - burke - ernzerhof exchange correlations were used @xcite .",
    "the plane - wave energy cutoffs were 240.30 and 178.33 ev for al and ti respectively . the number of electrons treated as valence electrons was three for al and four for ti . to simulate an isolated two - body system , * @xmath5 * -point calculations were performed in a cubic box of side 15  . with this setup ,",
    "the interactions between periodic images were verified to be negligible .",
    "the self - consistent loop was converged with a tolerance of 0.1 mev . to extract the two - body interaction potentials ,",
    "the appropriate atomic energies were subtracted from the total energy . with these modifications , there were three regions of pair interactions based on the distance between two atoms @xmath6 :    @xmath7    in the above expressions , @xmath8 denotes the original pair interaction , @xmath9 denotes the part of pair interaction that is fitted to the ab initio data , and @xmath10 represents a natural cubic spline interpolating @xmath8 and @xmath9 with @xmath11 the atomic number .",
    "the nonlinear - least - square fitted values of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 as well as the coefficients of the splines are presented in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the functional used in @xmath9 ( eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] ) follows the usual ziegler - biersack - littmark ( zbl ) parameterization @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig_modzope ] shows the short - range part of the modified pair interactions along with the ab initio data points .",
    "short - range part of the pair interactions modified from the original al - ti embedded - atom potentials @xcite .",
    "the data points denote the ab initio energies used for fitting . ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in mcpl6 , the preferred location for the al - al dumbbell is at the interface layer of al films with [ 11@xmath17 orientation ( in plane with the close - packed layer ) with a formation energy of 1.27 ev . note that miller indices used to describe the dumbbell orientation are with respect to a cubic system . in the middle of the al films ,",
    "the preferred al - al dumbbell orientation is [ 100 ] with a formation energy of 1.84 ev ( @xmath00.6 ev higher than that at the interface layer ) .",
    "the situation in the ti films is even more pronounced , if a ti interstitial is found in the middle layer of a ti film , it forms a [ 11@xmath17 dumbbell with formation energy of 3.28 ev .",
    "if the ti interstitial is placed in the ti layers 11 or 12 ( interface layer ) , it initiates a sequence of relaxations so that one ti atom occupies a lattice site in the al films leaving an al interstitial in al layer 13 ( interface layer ) forming an al - al [ 11@xmath17 dumbbell with formation energy of only 0.59 ev .",
    "the opposite trend of dumbbell formation energy is found in m100l6 . in this case , the al - al dumbbells are most stable in the middle of al films forming in [ 100 ] orientation with formation energy of 1.78 ev compared to 2.03 ev for [ 001 ] dumbbell found at the interface layer . within the ti films ,",
    "the middle layer also provide the stable location for ti - ti dumbbell forming in [ 100 ] orientation with formation energy of 2.88 ev compared to 3.04 ev for [ 001 ] dumbbell found at the interface .",
    "hence , it is clear why in the close - packed multilayers , the sias migrate to the interface while in the m100 system they migrate away from the interface to the middle of the film . figure [ figdbm100 ] illustrates the migration process of an al interstitial initially placed in the al interface layer ( red atom ) that results in the formation of a [ 100 ] dumbbell in al middle layer ( gray ) .",
    "( color online ) migration pathway of an al atom ( red ) initially at octahedral interstitial site in m100l6 resulting in the formation of a [ 100 ] dumbbell in the middle layer of al film ( light gray ) . ]",
    "figure [ fighe]a shows the cross - section image of al - ti multilayer sample with thickness of 5 nm per film ( @xmath021 layers ) obtained with underfocused tem .",
    "the image was taken after he irradiation with dose 10@xmath2 atoms/@xmath3 at room temperature . in this image ,",
    "ti films appear darker than al due to atomic number contrast . in the ti films",
    ", bright spots can be seen that represent he bubbles .",
    "the diameter of the bubbles is @xmath01 nm . this result is intriguing for a reason that due to a lower displacement threshold energy of al compared to ti , the nucleation of small bubbles via a kickout mechanism ( a cluster of he atoms displacing a host atom from its lattice site ) would be expected to occur in al films . as a reference , to create a 1-nm bubble , @xmath056 ti atoms or @xmath059 al atoms would need to be displaced .",
    "the fact that the bubbles are found in the ti films suggests that the distribution of he atoms during the irradiation plays a major role in determining the morphology and location of the bubbles .",
    "it is possible that the larger stopping power of ti films has caused the he atoms to be stopped and contained in the ti films more effectively than in al films . in this scenario , the necessary space needed for the bubbles is created not via a kickout mechanism but rather during the collision cascade itself . in this stopping process , the impinged ti atoms may remain in the ti films or be displaced to the al films .",
    "if the impinged ti atoms can be displaced to the al films , this process will greatly favor the creation of the necessary excess volume for the he atoms to form small bubbles in ti films .",
    "the defect imbalance that is observed in the simulations provides a clear proof that displacing ti atoms from ti films to al films is indeed easier than the reverse .",
    "( color online ) a ) underfocused and b ) overfocused tem images showing the location of helium bubbles in the upper middle region of the ti / al multilayer sample 5 nm per film . in the underfocused image",
    "the he bubbles appear bright and in overfocused image he bubbles have dark contrast .",
    "the bubbles are preferentially segregated to the darker contrast ti layers .",
    "c ) srim simulation showing he ion profile and damage profile . ]    in figure [ fighe]a , the he bubbles are arranged in a row with a somewhat regular spacing between the bubbles .",
    "more importantly , the bubbles are located near the interface towards the al films below the ti films where they reside , i.e. the location of the bubbles is biased towards the direction of the irradiation .",
    "this provides another clue that he bubble formation in the ti films is associated with a preferential flux of sias from ti films to al films during the irradiation as described above .",
    "figure [ fighe]c shows the he ion profile and the damage profile obtained with srim simulations .",
    "the rectangular block represents the region of al - ti sample that was imaged .",
    "the damage profile corresponds to the distribution of the vacancies .",
    "this work has revealed several important properties of al / ti nanolayers in response to radiation damage , the most important finding being the observation of strong defect partitioning during collision cascades that imparts a strong asymmetry in radiation damage . during maximum damage production",
    "initiated with 1.5-kev pka , asymmetry in the point defects creation between the two dissimilar materials al or ti is observed with @xmath060% of vacancies are created in al films while @xmath070% of interstitials are created in al films .",
    "the excess interstitials in the al films is a direct consequence of the preferential flux of displaced atoms in this nanolayered system .",
    "he irradiation experiments at a low dose of 10@xmath2 atoms/@xmath3 and at room temperature were performed to investigate the interface effects on radiation damage .",
    "the experimental data shows a formation of @xmath01-nm diameter bubbles in the ti films near the interface .",
    "the results from the simulations and experiments seem to suggest that the he bubble formation is associated with the preferential flux of sias during the irradiation in that the he atoms impinge on ti films and displace ti atoms into the al films .",
    "this is further supported by the location of the bubbles being near the interface and biased towards the direction of the irradiation .    in all of the interface models in this study ,",
    "the number of frenkel pairs created during maximum damage production is smaller than the bulk average of the constituent materials .",
    "this difference is amplified for thinner films in accordance with experimental observations on other multilayer systems .",
    "this observation is understood using a phenomenological model that ti exhibits a larger stopping power than al and that the fraction of energy deposited in ti films increases as the films are made thinner . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of surviving frenkel pairs at the end of simulations is larger than the bulk average .",
    "the difficulty for anti - defect recombinations is caused by defect partitioning in which in al films there are too many interstitials than the available vacancies while the opposite applies in ti films .",
    "this defect partitioning increases with the increasing number of interfaces ( thinner films ) resulting in more than 90% of surviving interstitials located in the al films for nanolayers with @xmath18 6 layers per film .",
    "these simulation results , when considering all the other experimental and modeling results for nanolayered systems , suggest that , in addition to interface structure and chemical mixing , we add degree of defect partitioning to the list of desirable system properties in the design of radiation tolerant material systems .",
    "differential material responses that grow with increased radiation dose are not a recipe for stable damage tolerant material systems .",
