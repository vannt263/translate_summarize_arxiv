    "the aim of this communication is to present and describe a computational package to handle first - principles density functional ( dft ) based studies of electronic structure of systems without long - ranged lattice translational symmetry .",
    "bulk disordered alloys and surfaces and interfaces which are either flat , corrugated or rough fall under this category which our formalism should be able to take care of .",
    "the aim is also to go beyond the usual mean - field approaches like the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) and be able to take into account configuration fluctuations of the local environment .",
    "lack of lattice translational symmetry means that the standard reciprocal space techniques based on the powerful bloch theorem can no longer be applicable and we shall depend on alternative techniques based purely on real space approaches .",
    "our formalism will be a marriage of three distinct methods which have been individually applied extensively : namely , the recursion method ( rm ) of haydock  @xcite-@xcite , the augmented space method proposed by one of us @xcite-@xcite ( asr ) and the tight - binding , linear muffin - tin orbitals method ( tb - lmto ) @xcite .",
    "the last mentioned provides us with a dft self - consistent sparse representation of the hamiltonian in a real - space minimal basis @xmath0 which spans the hilbert space @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 labels the sites where the ion - cores sit and @xmath3 are the angular momentum indexes . for a disordered system the matrix elements of the hamiltonian representation in this basis are random .",
    "this representation is then taken over by the asr to generate a modified hamiltonian representation in the outer product space of @xmath1 and the space @xmath4 of configuration fluctuations of the random parameters .",
    "this modified hamiltonian in the augmented space @xmath5 represents a collection of all possible hamiltonians for all possible configurations of hamiltonian representations .",
    "once this is done the rm allows us to obtain the matrix elements of the green functions related to the kohn - sham equation for the electronic states .",
    "the augmented space theorem ( ast )  @xcite relates a specific matrix element of the green function in the augmented space @xmath6 to the configuration averaged green functions .",
    "the rm is a purely real - space based technique , and therefore as applicable to a bulk system as one with surfaces , interfaces or extended defects . in the following",
    "we shall describe each of the points raised above in some detail .",
    "the tb - lmto has been described in great detail earlier @xcite,@xcite-@xcite .",
    "we shall only quote here the main results which will be relevant for setting up the asr programme .",
    "the starting point is the kohn - sham equation with the muffin - tin effective crystal potential .",
    "the basis chosen for representation of the wave - function are the muffin - tin orbitals @xmath0 : if we expand the wave - function in terms of a linear combination of these muffin - tin orbitals and substitute the expansion in the kohn - sham equation we obtain the korringa - kohn - rostocker ( kkr ) secular equation  :    @xmath7    energy linearization gives the eigen - type lmto secular equation :    e__n_m_ll - h^(2)__nl,_ml= 0    where , the ` second order ' hamiltonian is given by :    ^(2)__n,_m = _  _ _ n_m+__n,_m - _ _",
    "n,_k  _ _ k   _ _ k,_m [ ham ]    note that each element is a matrix in the @xmath8 space . in the screened representation",
    "the structure matrix @xmath9 is short - ranged and the hamiltonian is sparse  :    @xmath10    the expansion energies @xmath11 are chosen suitably by us at the center of the energy window of our interest and the potential parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 are diagonal in @xmath8 space and are self - consistently generated .",
    "the structure matrix @xmath14 is obtained from the geometry of the lattice .",
    "note that the tb - lmto basis is minimal and hence usually it is enough to take @xmath15 and in a majority of cases one does not have to go beyond @xmath16    at this point we should comment on several possible generalizations : we have energy linearized the secular equation . in case",
    "we do not wish to do so , we can still deal with a energy dependent  hamiltonian \" or  secular matrix \" @xmath17 .",
    "this is the tb - kkr .",
    "the subsequent recursion becomes energy - dependent , however each recursion at each energy point can be parallely carried out for efficiency .",
    "such energy dependent recursion has been carried out by us earlier @xcite .",
    "the assumption ( a posteriori shown after calculations ) was that the recursion coefficients are weakly energy dependent , therefore recursion is carried out an equi - spaced ",
    "seed \" points and the intermediate points found by interpolation .",
    "further , if we allow for third - nearest neighbour sparsity in the hamiltonian we could start with the real - space full - potential lmto ( rs - fplmto ) of eriksson @xcite .",
    "whereas , the above formulation is general enough , we should stress on the fact that the hamiltonian representation is an infinite matrix .",
    "lack of lattice translation symmetry means that we are unable to symmetry reduce the dimensionality of the matrix to essentially @xmath18 .",
    "we therefore have to resort to techniques which allow us to deal with infinite matrices .",
    "the recursion method was exactly such a technique introduced by haydock @xcite-@xcite to obtain the green functions associated with the secular equation .",
    "this would give us the density of states from which we may obtain properties like the fermi energy , the charge and magnetization densities , the magnetic moment and the band energy .",
    "a recent generalization also gives us correlation functions associated with response functions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the rm begins by recursively changing the basis through a three term recurrence relation :    @xmath19    mutual orthogonality of this new basis gives :    @xmath20    to understand how the above equations are efficiently operationally coded on the computer , let us first describe the hamiltonian as an operator @xmath21 . from eqn.([ham ] )    @xmath22    of these operators four are ` diagonal ' : * e*@xmath23 , * c * , @xmath24 and * o*. their structure are all of the form : @xmath25 . while the structure matrix is off - diagonal : @xmath26 .",
    "if we represent a hilbert space ` vector ' @xmath27 by a matrix as shown below  :    @xmath28    the action of the diagonal operators * d * is rather simple :    1 .   one by one choose non - zero rows @xmath29 of @xmath27 2 .",
    "multiply @xmath30 and add this to the @xmath31-th row of a new @xmath32 .",
    "3 .   repeat this for all non - zero rows of @xmath27 .",
    "finally @xmath33    the action of the off - diagonal operator * s * is more complicated as it has the information of the underlying lattice or network embedded in it .",
    "the first step would be to prepare the  neighbour map \" ( nm ) .",
    "the nm is a matrix @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the @xmath36-th neighbour of the @xmath31-th site on the lattice or network .",
    "we have first to number the lattice / network points by integers .",
    "the near neighbour vectors point in different directions , while numbering this directionality has to be carefully recorded , since the structure matrix between @xmath2 and @xmath37 will depend upon the direction of @xmath38 . in figure [ map ]",
    "we show the geometry of a bulk square lattice , a square lattice with a plane surface ( 100 ) , one with a corrugated surface ( 110 ) and a network with four local bonds .",
    "since the integer numbering increases always clockwise from a site , the directionality is preserved .",
    "the neighbour maps , also preserving directionality , for the first three examples are  :    @xmath39    the first four columns give us the neighbours in these four directions and the last column gives us the number of neighbours .",
    "for the fourth example of a fourfold coordinated planar random network , the neighbour map is the same for the square lattice , however the * s * is different .",
    "the action of * s * on a vector @xmath27 is prompted by the relevant neighbour map .",
    "the operations proceed as follows   :    1 .",
    "one by one choose rows @xmath29 of @xmath27 2 .   from the neighbour map",
    "choose @xmath40 ( which is the @xmath41-th neighbour of @xmath31 ) 3 .",
    "multiply @xmath42 and add this to the @xmath43-th row of a new @xmath32 4 .",
    "repeat this for all the non - zero rows of @xmath27 .",
    "finally @xmath44 .    the the recursive operations described in eqns . ( [ rec ] ) can be encoded into the following modules : + a. ( @xmath45 ) , which describes the action of the hamiltonian on a ` vector ' .",
    "+ b. the ( @xmath46 ) which calculates the coefficients @xmath47 recursively : +    the two vectors @xmath48 and @xmath49 are input / output vectors of the module hop , while the three vectors @xmath50 and @xmath51 are dummies which are needed within the module . the space for these dummies may be dynamically allocated during this procedure and released after the operation is over .",
    "the same is true for the vector @xmath48 in the module rec .",
    "( [ albe ] ) indicates that in the new basis the hamiltonian representation is tri - diagonal .",
    "it follows immediately that the green function for the system is given by a continued fraction :    @xmath52    the asymptotic part of the green function @xmath53 is called the _",
    "terminator_. many terminators are available in literature .",
    "the suitable one depends upon the way in which the coefficients @xmath54 behave as @xmath55 .",
    "the most commonly used is the square root terminator which is suitable when @xmath56 .",
    "luchini and nex @xcite have suggested a modification when calculations up to a large @xmath57 is not possible .",
    "if we carry out the terminator approximation after @xmath57 steps the first @xmath58 moments of the density of states are _ exact _ and it has been shown that the asymptotic moments are also accurately reproduced .",
    "beer and pettifor @xcite have suggested an alternative way of obtaining the terminator .",
    "they note that @xmath59 so that the beer - pettifor prescription is a closed algorithm .",
    "it wins over the square - root terminator described above when the convergence of the coefficients is either oscillatory or slow .",
    "viswanathan and muller @xcite have suggested several other terminators like the terminator with an exponential tail , suitable when @xmath60 and the terminator with a gaussian tail , suitable when @xmath61 .",
    "we shall have options for several terminating procedures so that the user may choose according to his need . c. the ( @xmath62 ) which calculates the green function .",
    "+    the partial density of states , projected onto a particular @xmath63 , is :    n__il(e ) = -  _ 0 m   g__il,_il(e+i )    it is clear from this discussion that the recursion procedure is general enough to deal with lattices of any complexity , surfaces and interfaces and disordered networks .",
    "finally we come to the main part of the package : that which deals with disorder",
    ". the augmented space formalism @xcite allows us to directly compute the configuration average of the green function by constructing a hamiltonian in the augmented space of configurations of the random parameters .",
    "the formalism is based on ideas prevalent in quantum measurement theory : we associate with each random parameter @xmath64 an operator @xmath65 whose spectrum @xmath66 are the measured values of the parameter .",
    "the configuration state of @xmath64 are the eigenkets @xmath67 of @xmath65 , which , therefore is an operator in the space @xmath68 spanned by the different configuration states . given this ,",
    "the probability density of the parameter is    @xmath69    where    @xmath70    the augmented space theorem @xcite then gives us the configuration average of _ any _ function of the random variables  :    ( \\{n_i})= ( \\{n_i } )    here ,    1 .",
    "it is a member of the basis set @xmath72 which spans the configuration space @xmath73 of the set of random parameters @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath75 is an operator in the configuration space @xmath76 .",
    "it is the _ same _ operator functional of @xmath77 as @xmath78 was a function of @xmath74 .",
    "the expression is exact .",
    "the configuration average is done exactly first , then the approximations may be carried out maintaining various physical constraints .",
    "the philosophy is very different from the mean - field approximations like the cpa .",
    "if we apply this to the configuration averaged green function of a random hamiltonian @xmath79 :    @xmath80    let us take as an example the case of a disordered binary alloy : the hamiltonian has the same form as eqn .",
    "( [ ham ] ) but  :    @xmath81    the random  occupation \" variables @xmath64 take the values 0 and 1 with probabilities proportional of the concentrations x and y of the constituents a and b. @xmath65 has a @xmath82 representation : @xmath83 .",
    "if we denote the basis of the above representation by @xmath84 , then @xmath85    and each of the potential parameters become operators in the configuration space , for example :    @xmath86    where @xmath87 and @xmath88",
    ". also , since the structure matrix is not random :    = _ ij _ _",
    "i_j  i_ij [ str ]    @xmath89    if we now compare eqns .",
    "( [ avgreen ] ) and ( [ ham - as ] ) with eqns .",
    "( [ ham2])-([gf ] ) it becomes clear that once we have defined the hamiltonian in the space of configurations , the recursion method may be directly used to obtain the configuration averaged green function .",
    "the approximation involved will then only be the  termination \" approximation .",
    "heine s  black - body theorem \" @xcite indicates that most electronic structure energetics is dominated by the immediate environment of a site .",
    "this is a major justification of the termination approximation . unlike the cpa which gives only the first eight moments of the density of states exactly and",
    "the asymptotic moments accurately , the augmented space recursion gives @xmath58 moments exactly ( where the termination is done after @xmath57 steps ) and the asymptotic moments also accurately . in most of our calculations",
    "we can take @xmath57 about 8 - 9 steps .",
    "the full package is divided into several modules .",
    "the first is the preparation module .",
    "this module has two branches , one each for each constituent of the alloy .",
    "each branch runs parallely in two different slave processors .",
    "the structure matrix is prepared in the master processor .",
    "this module prepares the following :    1 .",
    "it prepares the two control files for the different alloy constituents .",
    "this part is interactive with the user .",
    "2 .   it carries out the simple hartree calculation and prepares the atomic radii of the constituents and the initial charge density .",
    "3 .   it calculates the overlap between atomic spheres and inputs empty spheres maintaining the symmetries .",
    "4 .   it calculates the structure matrix from the inputs of the control files .",
    "the preparation module is followed by the main asr - module .",
    "this module is called by the routine _ lmasr_.",
    "this main module is divided into five smaller modules :    * : this module reads the data generated by the preparation module .",
    "it checks the inputs for consistency .",
    "the routines in this module are again those in the stuttgart lmto47 , but modified to read the inputs for _ both _ the two constituents of the alloy .",
    "0.4 cm * : at the start of the dft self - consistency loop , this module takes the overlap of a simple hartree atomic density calculation in the preparation module and generates the hartree and exchange - correlation potentials , spheridizes them and inputs them to the atomic module that follows . in later steps of the self - consistency loop ,",
    "this module first mixes the charge densities of the earlier steps and prepares the hartree and exchange - correlation potentials , spheridizes them for input into the atomic module .",
    "0.2 cm + - at this point there is a choice of using either the standard dft exchange - correlation potentials or , alternatively , there is a branch module _",
    "harbola - sahni _ which sets up the harbola - sahni potential for the study of excited states @xcite .",
    "0.4 cm * : this is the atomic module .",
    "it takes the spheridized kohn - sham potential generated in module b and solves the radial kohn - sham equation numerically .",
    "the kohn - sham orbitals and energies then lead to the potential parameters for each constituent .",
    "those for the two constituents are calculated on different processors .",
    "the parameters are first calculated in the orthogonal representation .",
    "a new routine _ gtoa _ , not present in the stuttgart lmto47 package , then transforms them to the most screened tight - binding representation . 0.4 cm * : this is the main asr module .",
    "the routines herein have been fully developed by us and form the main backbone of the package .",
    "the input are the tight - binding hamiltonian parameters from the atomic module .",
    "first they are combined with the alloy composition to prepare the augmented space hamiltonian . the nearest neighbour map in augmented space is then generated .",
    "next , the recursion is carried out for each @xmath8 value , terminators generated and the @xmath8 projected density of states are calculated .",
    "each different recursion for each @xmath8 value is carried out on a different processor , thus vastly accelerating the calculations .",
    "+ we then proceed to calculate the total density of states and the fermi energy .",
    "again , branching out into different processors , we calculate the @xmath8-dependent moments and magnetic moments . of all the modules , this is the one amenable to maximum parallelization .",
    "0.2 cm + - at this point we have the possibility of introducing short ranged order.the asr for short - ranged order has been described in some detail earlier @xcite .",
    "the branching for this choice occurs just before we set up the augmented space hamiltonian .",
    "the extra input is the warren - cowley short ranged order parameter .",
    "0.2 cm + - also at this point we have the option to introducing disorder in the structure matrix because of size mismatch between the two constituents of the alloy .",
    "the branching now takes place earlier in the preparation module where we generate not one , but three different structure matrices : @xmath90 and @xmath91 . in the ` end point ' approximation",
    "@xcite the eqn .",
    "( [ str ] ) is now replaced by : + = _ ij \\ { +    ' '' '' + _",
    "ij + ^(1)_ij ( n_i+n_j ) + ^(2)_ij n_i_j } _ ij + where @xmath92,@xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "this modification will be available in this module . 0.2 cm +",
    "it is in these last two options that the asr really scores over the cpa , which can not really deal with either short - ranged order or off - diagonal disorder as both involve more than one site .",
    "the competing methodology is the special quasi - random structures ( sqs ) @xcite .",
    "however , if we are dealing with materials with many atoms per unit cell and non - stoichiometric compositions , the sqs required will be rather large and will involve use of _ huge _ unit cells . here",
    "the tb - lmto - asr with the use of much smaller unit cells will score .",
    "we have shown earlier @xcite that both these two methods give virtually the same results for the density of states .",
    "0.4 cm * : in this module the @xmath8-dependent moments are used to obtain the charge density .",
    "we also calculate the total energy , including the madelung term . for the disordered alloy",
    ", the madelung term is obtained from the procedure suggested by skriver and ruban @xcite . finally the old and new moments are mixed , the mixed charge density thus obtained is input back in module b. this is iterated till convergence in both energy and charge density is achieved .",

    "these potential parameters are used at the input point of our asr routines in module d.    our present dft modules deal only with collinear magnetism . for",
    "spin dependent calculations the hamiltonian is separable in spin space .",
    "thus the spin is merged with the label @xmath8 which is now @xmath107 and we have just to carry out twice the number of recursions : for @xmath108 and @xmath109 . in case",
    "we wish to introduce spin - orbit coupling and possibility of non - collinear magnetism , we have to replace the dft module with one dealing with density matrices , rather than densities @xcite and the asr module with one applying generalized or vector recursion @xcite-@xcite which was designed to deal with hamiltonians whose representation in spin - space or ` spinor ' bases is not diagonal :    @xmath110    this new module is under preparation @xcite and will be incorporated once the basic checks are carried out . here",
    "we mention this in order to bring out the different possibilities and versatility of the package .",
    "we have described the contents and commented upon the efficiency and versatility of the tb - lmto - asr package .",
    "we shall conclude by describing two different applications : namely , the alloys @xmath111 where both the constituents are non - magnetic in the bulk and the @xmath112-band centres of cu and zn are well separated ; and fe@xmath99cr@xmath95 where both constituents are magnetic and their @xmath112-bands overlap .",
