    "the inverse scattering problem , non - destructive evaluation , is one of the intriguing research topics since it is closely related to human life . it is because it applies not only to physics , engineering , or image medical science but also to identifying the cracks of the structures such as concrete walls , machines , or buildings",
    "therefore , it has been considerably investigated by many researchers to suggest the algorithm regarding this problem or to experiment and analyze previously suggested algorithms .",
    "related works can be found in @xcite and references therein .    however , the inverse scattering problem is such a difficult problem that not many methods have been studied other than the reconstruction method based on the iterative method such as newton - type method , refer to @xcite .",
    "regarding the algorithms of using a newton - type method , in case the initial shape is quite different from the unknown target , the reconstruction of material leads to failure with the non - convergence or yielding faulty shapes . even though the reconstruction ends up with a successful result",
    ", it could take a great deal of time .",
    "therefore , several non - iterative algorithms have been suggested because they can reconstruct the shape that is quite similar to the target , and thus it can be used as a good initial guess , which also takes a short time and efficient in iterative methods ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    among them , the non - iterative reconstruction algorithm such as kirchhoff and subspace migration has been consistently studied thanks to its better imaging product .",
    "however , the existing research on this algorithm has been applied heuristically .",
    "that is , it mostly relied on experimental results .",
    "although research on several structures was conducted , it was based on experiments or statistical approach , not revealing the mathematical structures explicitly , refer to @xcite and references therein .",
    "it resulted in the difficulties of explaining the results theoretically .",
    "recently , an analysis of mathematical structure of single- and multi - frequency subspace migration for imaging of small electromagnetic materials has been conducted by establishing a relationship with bessel function of integer order in full - view inverse scattering problems , refer to @xcite .",
    "this remarkable research has shown the reason why subspace migration is effective and why application of multi - frequency guarantees better imaging performance than application of single - frequency .",
    "motivated by this work , this analysis is successfully extended to the limited - view inverse scattering problems ( see @xcite ) .",
    "afterwards , a multi - frequency subspace migration weighted by applied frequency has been suggested in @xcite to obtain more precise results .",
    "furthermore , the reason why the suggested algorithm presents better imaging products was demonstrated mathematically and an analysis of multi - frequency subspace migration weighted by the power of applied frequency has been considered in @xcite .",
    "this research concludes that increasing the power of applied frequency is meaningless , so that multi - frequency subspace migration weighted by applied frequency is a good algorithm for imaging .",
    "recently , it has been confirmed that a multi - frequency subspace migration weighted by the logarithmic function of applied frequency can yield more appropriate imaging result than the one suggested in @xcite .",
    "however , one can face difficulties in identifying the reason why it shows the better performance through the mathematical analysis . motivated by this difficulty , we derive an indefinite integration of square of bessel function of order zero of the first kind multiplied by the natural logarithmic function .",
    "based on this integration , we discover the structure of multi - frequency subspace migration weighted by the logarithmic function of applied frequency by establishing a relationship with bessel function of integer order of the first kind , and provide the reason of better imaging performance .",
    "the organization of this study is as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we briefly introduce two - dimensional direct scattering problem and subspace migration .",
    "section [ sec3 ] provides a survey on the structures of single- , multi- , and weighted multi - frequency subspace migrations , the derivation of indefinite integration of square of bessel function multiplied by the natural logarithmic function , and the the mathematical analysis on why multi - frequency subspace migration weighted by natural logarithmic function shows better imaging performance than the traditional one . in section [ sec4 ] ,",
    "several results of numerical experiments with noisy data are presented in order to support our analysis .",
    "finally , a short conclusion is mentioned in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "let us consider two - dimensional electromagnetic scattering from a thin , curve - like homogeneous inclusion within a homogeneous space @xmath0 .",
    "the latter contains an inclusion denoted as @xmath1 which is localized in the neighborhood of a curve @xmath2 .",
    "that is , @xmath3 where the supporting @xmath2 is a simple , smooth curve in @xmath0 , @xmath4 is the unit normal to @xmath2 at @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is a strictly positive constant which specifies the thickness of the inclusion ( small with respect to the wavelength ) , refer to figure [ thininclusion ] . throughout this paper , we denote @xmath7 be the unit tangent vector at @xmath8 .",
    "sketch of the thin inclusion @xmath1 in two - dimensional space @xmath0.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    in this paper , we assume that every material is characterized by its dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability at a given frequency .",
    "let @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the permittivity and permeability of the embedding space @xmath0 , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 the ones of the inclusion @xmath1 .",
    "then , we can define the following piecewise constant dielectric permittivity @xmath13 and magnetic permeability @xmath14 respectively . note that if there is no inclusion , i.e. , in the homogeneous space , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are equal to @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively . in this paper",
    ", we set @xmath19 and @xmath20 for convenience .    at strictly positive operation frequency @xmath21 ( wavenumber @xmath22 ) ,",
    "let @xmath23 be the time - harmonic total field which satisfies the helmholtz equation @xmath24 similarly , the incident field @xmath25 satisfies the homogeneous helmholtz equation @xmath26 as is usual , the total field @xmath23 divides itself into the incident field @xmath25 and the scattered field @xmath27 , @xmath28 . notice that this unknown scattered field @xmath29 satisfies the sommerfeld radiation condition @xmath30 uniformly in all directions @xmath31 .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the illumination of plane waves @xmath32 and far fields in free space where @xmath33 is a two - dimensional vector on the unit circle @xmath34 in @xmath0 . for convenience ,",
    "we denote @xmath35 to be a discrete finite set of observation directions and @xmath36 be the set of incident directions .",
    "the far - field pattern is defined as a function @xmath37 which satisfies @xmath38 as @xmath39 uniformly on @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "then , based on @xcite , @xmath37 can be written as an asymptotic expansion formula .    for @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the far - field pattern @xmath44 can be represented as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is uniform in @xmath47 , @xmath42 , and @xmath48 is a @xmath49 symmetric matrix defined as follows : let @xmath50 and @xmath51 denote unit tangent and normal vectors to @xmath2 at @xmath52 , respectively . then    * @xmath48 has eigenvectors @xmath50 and @xmath51 . *",
    "the eigenvalue corresponding to @xmath50 is @xmath53 . *",
    "the eigenvalue corresponding to @xmath51 is @xmath54 .",
    "now , we introduce subspace migration for imaging of thin inclusion @xmath1",
    ". detailed description can be found in @xcite . in order to introduce ,",
    "we generate a multi - static response ( msr ) matrix @xmath55_{j , l=1}^{n}\\in\\mathbb{c}^{n\\times n}$ ] whose element @xmath56 is the collected far - field at observation number @xmath57 for the incident number @xmath58 . in this paper , we assume that @xmath59 , i.e. , we have the same incident and observation directions configuration .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that for a given frequency @xmath60 , based on the resolution limit , any detail less than one - half of the wavelength can not be retrieved .",
    "hence , if we divide thin inclusion @xmath1 into @xmath61 different segments of size of order @xmath62 , only one point , say , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , at each segment will affect the imaging ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath65 , the elements of msr matrix can be represented as follows : @xmath66e^{i\\omega({\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_j+{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_l)\\cdot{\\mathbf{y}}_m } , \\end{aligned}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 denotes the length of @xmath2 .",
    "now , let us perform the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of @xmath68 @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 nonzero singular values such that @xmath72 and @xmath73 and @xmath74 are left- and right - singular vectors of @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "based on the structure of ( [ elementofmsr ] ) , define a vector @xmath75 as @xmath76e^{i\\omega{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_1\\cdot{\\mathbf{z}}},{\\mathbf{c}}\\cdot[1,{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_2]e^{i\\omega{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_2\\cdot{\\mathbf{z}}},\\cdots ,    { \\mathbf{c}}\\cdot[1,{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_n]e^{i\\omega{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_n\\cdot{\\mathbf{z}}}\\bigg]^t,\\ ] ] where the selection of @xmath77 depends on the shape of the supporting curve @xmath78 ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "a normalized multi - frequency subspace migration is considered .",
    "this is introduced as follows ; for multi - frequency @xmath97 , by an assumption of @xmath98 for all @xmath99 , a normalized multi - frequency subspace migration @xmath100 is given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the number of nonzero singular values of msr matrix @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",

    "a weighted multi - frequency subspace migration has been introduced @xmath108 and following result is obtained .    if the total number of incident and observation directions @xmath94 is sufficiently large and satisfies @xmath105 for @xmath104 .",

    "hence , it can be said that @xmath113 is an improved version of @xmath100 .      based on the improved procedure presented above ,",
    "it is natural to consider the following multi - frequency subspace migration weighted by some function @xmath114 : @xmath115 then , based on the results in section [ sec3 - 1 ] , @xmath116 should be represented as the following form : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is a positive definite function .",
    "based on several recent works @xcite , the term @xmath119 is disturbing the imaging performance since it generates some unnecessary artifacts .",

    "<S> the present study seeks to investigate mathematical structures of a multi - frequency subspace migration weighted by the natural logarithmic function for imaging of thin electromagnetic inhomogeneities from measured far - field pattern . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we designed the algorithm and calculated the indefinite integration of square of bessel function of order zero of the first kind multiplied by the natural logarithmic function . </S>",
    "<S> this is needed for mathematical analysis of improved algorithm to demonstrate the reason why proposed multi - frequency subspace migration contributes to yielding better imaging performance , compared to previously suggested subspace migration algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis is based on the fact that the singular vectors of the collected multi - static response ( msr ) matrix whose elements are the measured far - field pattern can be represented as an asymptotic expansion formula in the presence of such inhomogeneities . to support the main research results , several numerical experiments with noisy data </S>",
