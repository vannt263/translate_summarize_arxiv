    "when a double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) finds itself in a solution with a condensing agent , it tends to take on a conformation that would minimise its exposure to the environment and , correspondingly , maximise the sites of self - contact  @xcite .",
    "since dsdna is a rather stiff molecule , variation of its shape implies a certain energy cost which is usually described as the elastic energy of bending and twisting . the aim of this paper is to derive simple estimates that help us to decide what conformation is preferable for a circularly closed dsdna in terms of its total energy .",
    "the molecule is assumed to be unknotted and torsionally relaxed when in pure water .",
    "we are interested in finding stable ground states and do not consider temperature effects .",
    "if we assign orientation to the centreline of the dsdna , then two ways of condensation are logically possible : the remote intervals of the dsdna chain can align next to each other such that their orientation is either the same or opposite .",
    "the first case is best achieved in a double- ( or multiple-)covered circle , while the second realises as a straight line interval with two loops at the ends ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ) .",
    "thus we come to familiar toroidal and racquet - like shapes  @xcite . here",
    "we consider the series of the simplest possible conformations : a toroid and a two - headed racquet .",
    "the latter does not necessarily imply a significant writhe , while the first has its writhing number growing linearly with its number of coils  @xcite .",
    "thus , the writhing number of a toroid with @xmath0 coils equals @xmath1 , if we neglect the thickness of the polymer , while a multiple - covered two - headed racquet may be made to have its writhing number vanish .",
    "we assume that the linking number is conserved , therefore , the non - zero writhe is compensated by twist which should be accounted for in the calculation of the elastic energy .",
    "recall that , to avoid accumulation of twist in long ropes , sailors store them in a figure-8 fashion , a similar trick is used when mountaineers `` butterfly '' the coils of their climbing ropes .",
    "these coilings are analogous to the two - headed racquets",
    ".    change of the relative orientation of contacting pieces of dsdna is only one , most pronounced , feature of two types of condensate . actually , the coupling of the particular sites that interact with each other differ as well . on the other hand ,",
    "the interaction potentials of two homologous and nonhomologous dna duplexes are found to be significantly different  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the monomer sequence may be intentionally tuned to amplify the effective attraction forces for one specific conformation .",
    "toroids and racquets may be considered as analogs of the secondary structures of single - stranded nucleic acids where dsdna plays part of a single stranded polymer and the hydrogen bonds between complementary nucleotides are replaced with the electrostatic attraction .",
    "the secondary structure of rna or ssdna may be controlled by varying their primary structure .",
    "similarly , the primary structure may affect the relative stability of toroids and racquets as the dsdna condensates .",
    "note that the sequence - dependent dna condensation was studied on double - stranded poly(dg - dc)@xmath2(dg - dc ) ( gc - dna ) and ds poly(da - dt)@xmath2(da - dt ) ( at - dna )  @xcite .",
    "the effects due to the relative orientation of the contacting pieces or to their specific sequence contents do not exist for such homogeneous primary structures .    as known from earlier work ( both theoretical and experimental ) for open polymer chains  @xcite",
    ", the racquets can only be so - called metastable structures which means that they always lose to toroids though their conformational energy may not differ much from that of toroids .",
    "numerical simulation suggests that interaction with adsorbing surface tend to stabilise metastable racquet - like structures  @xcite .",
    "experiments with condensation of circular plasmids ( closed un / nicked and open ) also show intermediate racquet - like shapes which seem to occur more often for unnicked dna  @xcite .",
    "what if the racquets be given the upper hand by building a dna with specially tuned mirrored homologous subsequences in order to increase their interaction potential ?",
    "the competing toroids must not feel it which could cause loss of their role as most stable structures .",
    "the model considered in this paper explores such a possibility . to simplify analysis",
    "it will be assumed that all the contacting sites in racquets have uniform interaction potential which can differ from that of toroids where the interaction forces are also assumed to be uniform .",
    "it was recently demonstrated by numerical simulation that presence of a direction - dependent potential affects condensation of semi - flexible polymers  @xcite .",
    "two ways of condesation of a circular dsdna : @xmath0-covered circles ( toroids ) ( a : an initial conformation with @xmath3 , b : @xmath4 , c : @xmath5 ) and @xmath6-folded two - headed racquets ( d : @xmath7 , e , f , g : @xmath8 ) .",

    "we do not account for dependence of the elastic moduli on the variations of the sequence of monomers .",
    "neither stretching of dna is included in the model as of minor importance .",
    "each piece of the polymer chain may be in contact with up to six other pieces .",

    "the polymer prefers to contact with itself in order to screen its surface from exposition to the solvent . to account for the self - attraction",

    ". the doubled coordination number @xmath19 counts the number of possible binding sites that are left non - occupied by @xmath0 parallel polymer strands which fill in the triangular lattice in the orthogonal cross section  @xcite .",

    "since the linking number is conserved , we may estimate the change of twist as @xmath42 , where the writhing number of the @xmath0-covered circle can be estimated as @xmath43 .",

    ", there is no chance for racquets if @xmath202 which describes the situation when the attraction is enhanced for parallel orientations of the contacting dsdna intervals .",
    "this effect could be easily achieved by building the closed dna from homologous pieces joined so that their sequence orientation is same .    on the other hand ,",
    "if one of the two parts is reversed , then this would give the preference to the antiparallel alignment like in the handle of the @xmath203-racquet and we have to look into the part of the diagram for @xmath204 .",
    "the model considered in this paper assumes that the self - interacting sites tend to arrange themselves in a parallel bundle .",
    "this is an idealisation that can not be achieved in reality because of topological constraints  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless in many cases dna forms highly - organised hexagonal bundles  @xcite .",
    "this justifies the parallelism approximation .",
    "the proposed tuning of the primary structure of dsdna may lead to creation of intrinsically bent pieces , e.g. the so - called a - tracts .",
    "this is known to influence the size of toroidal condensates  @xcite and may also shift the balance between toroids and racquets because the competing conformations differ in curvature .",
    "the latter is constant for toroids in the infinitely thin approximation but varies for racquets .",
    "the dsdna - dsdna interaction potential is rather complex and it may have its minima for a relative orientation of the duplex axes at a non - zero skew angle which depends on the distance between the molecules  @xcite . this may cause formation of twisted bundles even for unconstrained polymers  @xcite . in the simplest case of a single pair of interacting molecules",
    "the complexity of the interaction forces may lead to emergence of a plectonemic structure which could cause significant change of writhe .",
    "this effect can interfere with possible initial torsional strain of the closed dna in its reference zero - writhe conformation  @xcite . to release this strain dna",
    "may form plectonemes which could be facilitated or hindered by complex self - interaction forces .",
    "analysis of these effects is left for future work on elaboration of the model .",
    "the present model uses a rough estimate of topological features of two series of conformations focusing on the basic difference between two folding patterns .",
    "the metastability of the racquet - like shapes and a possibility to finely control their conformational energy may be exploited to construct a trigger mechanism which will be sensitive to small changes in the primary structure .",
