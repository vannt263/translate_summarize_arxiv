    "this approach is fine for the purposes of searching for long - range orientational order , but is inappropriate for the extraction of quantitative correlation functions .",
    "another issue is that the precise functional form of ( 3 ) arises from the cutoff scheme chosen .",
    "ideally , one would apply a physical theory which describes the higher wavelength modes and how the system responds to them ( in the case of spheres , part of this scheme could be a density functional - like theory ) , which would be more suitable for capturing the behavior of the correlation function over short distances than the hard cutoff that we used .

    "<S> this coexistence of ordered structures should not be confused with dislocation - mediated structural transitions theoretically studied in [ 6 ] and observed in [ 8 ] in athermal helical crystals , especially because of the difference in the observed sequence of coexisting structures .    , @xmath47 , in 1.2 @xmath4 m segments . </S>",

    "<S> sharp crossovers from orientationally ordered to disordered phases with decreasing volume fraction were observed . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find basic evidence for abrupt volume - fraction driven structure - to - structure transitions . </S>",
