    "several observational aspects of the galactic center black hole , including some strong deflection features , are discussed in the recent review @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it seems that subtle effects , like the comparison of different models of black holes corresponding to alternative theories , will need of a second generation of future instruments .",
