    "controlling the self - assembly of colloidal particles is an important aspect of pure and applied colloid science . in this context , assembling novel structures in liquid crystal matrices has become a very active field of research as a result of important theoretical and experimental advances @xcite .",
    "liquid crystals ( lcs ) are characterized by anisotropic mechanical and optical properties due to the long - range orientational molecular ordering .",
    "consequently , in addition to the usual isotropic colloidal interactions , colloids in liquid crystals interact through strongly anisotropic effective forces , and have been observed to self - assemble into ordered aggregates in two ( @xmath1 ) @xcite and three ( @xmath0 ) spatial dimensions @xcite .",
    "a distinctive feature of these systems is the presence of topological defects , the type of which determines the symmetry of the far - field director around an isolated colloidal particle , which in turn governs the asymptotic behavior of the nematic - induced colloidal interactions @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the interactions at short distances is more complex since the defects can move when the colloidal particles are brought close together , rendering the description of the self - assembly of liquid crystal colloids a challenging theoretical problem .",
    "theoretical and simulation methods have been developed to study lcs on various scales .",
    "on the macroscopic scale , the long - range forces between colloidal particles can be calculated using the frank - oseen ( fo ) elastic free energy approach @xcite . on the mesoscopic scale where non - linear effects become important , a description based on the landau - de gennes ( ldg ) tensorial order - parameter theory is necessary @xcite . this is the case when the interactions between the defects dominate , as revealed by the changes in their equilibrium structure when the distance between the particles decreases @xcite . on the microscopic scale ,",
    "presmectic ordering and density variations can not be ignored and density functional approaches @xcite or computer simulations are usually employed @xcite .",
    "the anchoring at the surfaces of colloidal particles can be controlled , for instance , through the adsorption of surfactants or deposition of thin organic or inorganic films @xcite .",
    "when the anchoring on a spherical colloid is planar , a tangential nematic director configuration is expected at the colloidal surface . at the fo level",
    "the boundary conditions are met by the creation of a pair of antipodal surface topological defects , called boojums @xcite .",
    "the boojums are aligned with the far - field director , ensuring that the far - field lc configuration is homogeneous as required by the global uniform boundary conditions @xcite .    recently ,",
    "experimental measurements of the effective forces between two spherical colloids with planar anchoring in a @xmath0 nematic have been reported @xcite .",
    "the authors have found that the forces at short distances deviate considerably from the asymptotic quadrupole - quadrupole ones , and that the equilibrium configuration of a pair of particles corresponds to close contact implying the absence of a repulsion at short distances .",

    "we concentrate on the mesoscale and present the results of systematic numerical analysis of the ldg free energy functionals in @xmath1 and @xmath0 for colloidal particles characterized by a tangential ( degenerate in @xmath0 ) anchoring .",

    "large distances @xmath5 the radial dependence of the measured force was found to comply with the expected @xmath6 quadrupolar behaviour .",
    "however , the angular dependence of the force disagreed qualitatively with the quadrupolar one at all distances , indicating the importance of the non - linear effects and a breakdown of the superposition approximation .    in what follows",

    "<S> the distortions are responsible for long - range effective colloidal interactions whose asymptotic behaviour is well understood . </S>",
    "<S> the short distance behaviour of the interaction , however , is sensitive to the structure and dynamics of the topological defects nucleated near the colloidal particles in the strong anchoring regime . </S>",
    "<S> the full non - linear theory is required in order to determine the interaction at short separations . </S>",
    "<S> spherical colloidal particles with sufficiently strong planar degenerate anchoring nucleate a pair of antipodal surface topological defects , known as boojums . </S>",
    "<S> we use the landau - de gennes formalism in order to resolve the mesoscopic structure of the boojum cores and to determine the pairwise colloidal interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the results in three ( @xmath0 ) and two ( @xmath1 ) spatial dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding free energy functionals are minimized numerically using finite elements with adaptive meshes . </S>",
    "<S> boojums are always point - like in @xmath1 , but acquire a rather complex structure in @xmath0 which depends on the combination of the anchoring potential , the radius of the colloid , the temperature and the lc elastic anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> we identify three types of defect cores in @xmath0 which we call single , double and split core boojums , and investigate the associated structural transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the split core structure is favoured by low temperatures , strong anchoring and small twist to splay or bend ratios . for sufficiently strong anchoring potentials characterised by a well - defined uniaxial minimum , the split core boojums are the only stable configuration . in the presence of two colloidal particles </S>",
    "<S> there are substantial re - arrangements of the defects at short distances , both in @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these re - arrangements lead to qualitative changes in the force - distance profile when compared to the asymptotic quadrupole - quadrupole interaction . in line with the experimental results , </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the defects prevents coalescence of the colloidal particles in @xmath1 , but not in @xmath0 systems . </S>"
