    "structure formation in the universe is an important subject of research in cosmology .",
    "a standard view of the structure formation is that density fluctuations with small amplitudes in the early universe have grown to be a variety of cosmic structures due to gravitational instability .",
    "the growth of the density fluctuations has been throughly investigated by linear perturbation theory of the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe within both the newtonian theory and general relativity  @xcite .",
    "relativistic linear perturbation theory was first derived by lifshitz  @xcite .",
    "such relativistic treatments are indispensable when we consider large - scale fluctuations . in his theory , however , there remains a gauge problem that unphysical perturbations are included in the solutions .",
    "this problem was carefully studied later by press and vishniac  @xcite .",
    "also developed was the gauge - invariant formulation  @xcite , which gives a conceptually straightforward way for dealing with cosmological perturbation .",
    "it is true that the linear theories play an important role in the study of gravitational instability , but they are valid only in the region where density contrast @xmath0 is much smaller than unity .",
    "( @xmath1 is energy density of the perturbed flrw universe and @xmath2 is that of the background flrw universe . ) as @xmath3 grows to be comparable to unity , nonlinear effects become essential and we need some kinds of nonlinear approximations .",
    "tomita  @xcite developed second - order perturbation theory by extending lifshitz s work to study nonlinear effect of gravitational instability for the matter - dominated universe .",
    "his approach , however , still depends on the assumption of @xmath3 being small .",
    "an approximation scheme without the assumption was proposed by zeldovich  @xcite within the newtonian framework .",
    "this scheme is known as zeldovich approximation , which is now widely applied to the problems of the large - scale structure formation .",
    "it has been shown that the zeldovich approximation can be regarded as a subclass of the first - order solutions in the lagrangian perturbation theory  @xcite",
    ". then higher - order extension of the zeldovich approximation , say , post - zeldovich approximation ( and post - post - zeldovich approximation and so on ) , is straightforwardly derived via the higher - order lagrangian approach  @xcite .",
    "relativistic versions of the zeldovich approximation have been also studied for the last few years by several authors  @xcite . here",
    "we will focus on our tetrad - based approach , whose correspondence to the original zeldovich approximation is made clear in ref .",
    "@xcite and extension to second order is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one of remarkably advantageous points of the zeldovich - type approximations , both the original newtonian one and the relativistic version , is that they include exact solutions when the deviation from the background flrw universe is locally one - dimensional .",
    "these exact solutions are known as zeldovich solutions  @xcite in the newtonian case and ( some class of ) szekeres solutions  @xcite in the general relativistic case , respectively . for this reason ,",
    "the zeldovich - type approximations are presumably accurate in description of nearly one - dimensional collapse .",
    "it is not clear , however , whether they also give high accuracy in the case of non one - dimensional collapse . in the newtonian framework",
    ", it has been investigated by using spherical models : the so - called top - hat collapse model  @xcite , the top - hat void model  @xcite , and some more general case  @xcite .",
    "( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for review . ) in addition , there is also a recent work  @xcite in which homogeneous spheroidal models are considered .",
    "an interesting implication is obtained in it : as the deviation of the models from the spherical symmetry becomes larger , the accuracy of the zeldovich - type approximations increases while the conventional ( eulerian ) approximations have the opposite tendency .",
    "it indicates that the zeldovich - type approximations may be the least accurate in the exactly spherical case .",
    "then , considering the spherical case may tell us the lowest accuracy of the zeldovich - type approximations .    in general relativity ,",
    "an exact solution of the spherically symmetric dust model is known as the lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) solution  @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , of interest to test the zeldovich - type approximations with the exact solutions to examine accuracy of the approximations .",
    "it is also instructive to clarify the differences between the conventional perturbation theories and the zeldovich - type approximations by imposing spherical symmetry and comparing them with the exact solutions .    in this paper",
    ", we compare the relativistic approximations such as the linear perturbation theory by lifshitz  @xcite , the second - order perturbation theory by tomita  @xcite , the relativistic zeldovich approximation by kasai  @xcite , and the relativistic post - zeldovich approximation by russ _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite with the ltb solution .",
    "we consider some initial conditions which have inhomogeneous matter distribution , not homogeneous one like the top - hat model adopted in the newtonian works .",
    "it will be shown that the zeldovich - type approximations are more useful than the conventional ones in the quasi - nonlinear regime in each case .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we summarize the relativistic perturbation theories mentioned above . in the section  [ spher ] ,",

    "however , since @xmath193 at @xmath194 , @xmath189 must vanish within a finite time .",
    "hence , at @xmath194 , the shell - crossing singularity will occur .",
    "( more generic arguments about the occurrence of shell - crossing singularity can be seen in ref .",
    "@xcite and the shell - crossing may occur in the region @xmath133 at first . )",
    "it should be noted that , in figures 5  ( a ) and 6  ( a ) , @xmath112 and @xmath113 take the same value as that of the ltb solution at @xmath184 where the shell - crossing will occur .",
    "then we must say that these figures show that the zeldovich - type approximations are not necessarily inaccurate even when the shell - crossing is occurring .",
    "let us consider the reason here .",
    "in fact , the deviation from the background hubble expansion is locally one - dimensional at the point .",
    "the definition of `` locally one - dimensional deviation '' we adopt here is that two of the eigenvalues of the peculiar deformation tensor @xmath195 are zero  @xcite .",
    "according to the definition , let us show the local one - dimensionality at @xmath196 . from eqs .",
    "( [ ltb_metric ] ) and ( [ r_c ] ) , @xmath197 since @xmath198 is diagonal in the spherical case , this means that the deviation at @xmath188 is locally one - dimensional .",
    "it is known that the zeldovich - type approximations become exact when the deviation is locally one - dimensional  @xcite . in this argument",
    ", the origin @xmath107 must be excluded because all components of the peculiar velocity vanish at the origin .",
    "thus we can lead a significant consequence that , at the points where @xmath70 , the zeldovich - type approximations coincide with the exact ltb solution , i.e. , @xmath199 note that this consequence is not limited to the specific initial density profile  ( [ former_case ] ) nor ( [ later_case ] ) .    turning to figures 5  ( a ) and 6  ( a )",
    ", we see that the coincidence of the density contrast at @xmath180 ( @xmath194 ) contribute to accuracy of the zeldovich - type approximations , and @xmath112 and @xmath113 give good fit around @xmath180 .",
    "this is the reason the zeldovich - type approximations do not necessarily give bad results even when the shell - crossing is occurring .",
    "we have tested the relativistic perturbative approximations to gravitational instability with the ltb solution .",
    "it has been shown that the zeldovich - type approximations give higher accuracy than the conventional ones in the quasi - nonlinear regime @xmath53 within general relativistic framework .",
    "our results are partly similar to the newtonian ones , but our consideration is more generic .",
    "especially we considered some cases in which matter distribution is inhomogeneous , and found that the zeldovich - type approximations are not necessarily inaccurate even when the shell - crossing is occurring .",
    "of course , the occurrence of the shell - crossing shows the break down of our treatment .",
    "however , this is due to the failure of our description of the matter as dust rather than the failure of zeldovich - type approximations .",
    "indeed , one of the case considered in the previous section includes the @xmath70 point , where the universe is locally `` open '' inside and is locally `` closed '' outside and the shell - crossing will occur at this radius .",
    "we have seen , in general , at the @xmath70 points ( except the origin @xmath107 ) , the deviation from the flrw model is locally one - dimensional and the zeldovich - type approximations become exact . and in the neighborhood of the points , we can expect that the zeldovich - type approximations are particularly accurate .",
    "the case considered here is exactly such an example .",
    "it should be also noted that `` one - dimensionality '' which makes the zeldovich - type approximations exact means not only globally plane - symmetric but also locally one - dimensional : such situations appear even in the spherically symmetric model .",
    "to discuss applicable range of the zeldovich - type approximations , we reconsider the density contrast at @xmath107 in the collapse case . at the turnaround time , accuracy of the zeldovich - type approximations already begins to fall down , i.e. , @xmath113 is about @xmath155 of @xmath139 and @xmath112 is about @xmath154 .",
    "inaccuracy will be accelerated beyond the turnaround time . in this sense , the turnaround epoch , when the peculiar velocity is as large as the hubble expansion , is one of criterion of applicable range of the zeldovich - type approximations .",
    "however , this criterion might not be practical , because one can not know the correct turnaround time in general , while we have been able to know that from the exact solution in our case . instead of the turnaround time ,",
    "the zeldovich - type approximations tell us the crunching time as the singularity in the density contrast , approximately . furthermore",
    ", we have also seen that pza tells us this crunching time more accurately than za in our spherical model",
    ". then we may be able to know the approximate turnaround time by the half of this crunching time of pza .",
    "it is said that the zeldovich approximation predicts pancake formation in the gravitational collapse of dust  @xcite .",
    "but it is beyond the turnaround time that the pancake will be formed and thus accuracy of the zeldovich approximation is not ensured at that time .",
    "if we try to examine final stage of the collapse quantitatively , we will need to develop a new approximation scheme which gives an accurate description even beyond the turnaround epoch ."
