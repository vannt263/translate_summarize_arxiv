    "fifty years after the discovery of optically selected qsos , the distinction between radio - loud qsos ( rlqs ) and radio - quiet qsos ( rqqs ) is still being debated . in a preliminary report",
    ", @xcite discussed 6 ghz observations of an optically selected qso sample taken from the sdss .",
    "these observations , made with the karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) , achieved unprecedented sensitivity which led to the detection of 97% of the sdss qsos with @xmath10 in a low - redshift ( @xmath0 ) volume - limited sample . in this paper , we report the full results of these observations including a new data analysis that detects 99% of the 178 studied qsos with @xmath10 in a low - redshift ( @xmath0 ) volume - limited sample .",
    "section  [ sec : background ] reviews the different criteria used to distinguish rlqs from rqqs and the evidence that rlqs and rqqs are or are not distinct populations . in section  [ sec : jvlasample ] we describe our volume - limited sample of low - redshift qsos and present results from the vla observations that suggests that for most qsos , the low luminosity ( @xmath11 ) radio emission is primarily the result of star formation in the host galaxy , while the emission in the more luminous objects the radio emission is related to the smbh .",
    "section  [ sec : sourcenotes ] includes notes on individual sources . in section  [ sec : twopopulations ] we discuss differences between rlqs and rqqs .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section  [ sec : summary ] .    all calculations in this paper",
    "assume a flat @xmath12cdm cosmology with @xmath13 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "spectral luminosities are specified by their source - frame frequencies , flux densities are specified in the observer s frame , and a mean spectral index @xmath16 is used to make frequency conversions ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "shortly following the recognition that quasi - stellar radio sources were surprisingly luminous at both radio and optical wavelengths @xcite , allan @xcite announced `` the existence of a major new constituent of the universe : the quasistellar galaxies '' which were optically selected and outnumbered the known ( and extremely radio loud ) quasi - stellar radio sources by a factor of @xmath17 .",
    "sandage s dramatic announcement was published in the may 1 , 1965 issue of the _ astrophysical journal _ ( the same day that it was received at the journal office ) and created considerable controversy .",
    "@xcite immediately pointed out that he had previously reported on similar objects which he called `` blue compact galaxies , '' while @xcite and @xcite argued that most of sandage s claimed quasi - stellar galaxies are only blue stars in our galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , it is now widely recognized that sandage s quasi - stellar galaxies , today called quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) , do outnumber quasi - stellar radio sources , albeit only by about an order of magnitude .",
    "although the term `` quasar '' is a portmanteau of `` quasi - stellar radio source '' @xcite , here we follow the definitions given by @xcite and endorsed by the _ astrophysical journal _ that ( 1 ) quasars include all extragalactic objects of `` starlike appearance ( or containing a dominant starlike component ) , '' even `` buried '' objects reddened or obscured by dust and objects selected at infrared or x - ray wavelengths , and ( 2 ) qsos are quasars selected optically .",
    "@xcite quantified the requirement for a `` dominant starlike component '' to distinguish _ bona fide _",
    "qsos from less - luminous agns such as seyfert nuclei : qsos must have @xmath18 when calculated using @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in the modern @xmath12cdm cosmology with @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ,",
    "such qsos have absolute magnitudes @xmath24 .",
    "however , most authors still use @xmath25 , following the letter but not the spirit of the @xcite criterion , and we also use that @xmath26 2 times more luminous limit for qsos .",
    "early targeted searches for radio emission from qsos @xcite had @xmath27% detection rates .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , the radio detection rate grew very slowly as the flux - density limit was lowered , leading to the suggestion that radio - loud qsos ( rlqs ) and radio - quiet qsos ( rqqs ) might have different flux - density distributions and thus comprise two distinct populations .",
    "( note that radio quiet has always meant radio weak , not completely radio silent ) .",
    "@xcite discussed the radio observations of 70 spectroscopically confirmed qsos selected from the michigan curtis schmidt surveys @xcite and claimed that the distribution of the logarithmic radio flux densities @xmath28 of qsos is sharply bimodal ( that is , has two peaks ) .",
    "this stimulated a controversy that persists to this day .",
    "however , @xcite recently pointed out that this claim resulted from a mathematical error and is not valid .    more sensitive 5 ghz vla observations with an rms noise @xmath29 allowed @xcite to detect 82% of the relatively bright ( @xmath30 ) _ bona fide _",
    "qsos with @xmath25 ( old cosmology ; @xmath31 today ) in the @xcite bright quasar survey ( bqs ) .",
    "they reached a radio / optical flux - density ratio @xmath32 and argued that the distributions of observed @xmath28 and @xmath33 appeared to be bimodal .",
    "@xcite preferred @xmath34 rather than @xmath35 because it is nearly distance - independent .",
    "also , if the radio and optical luminosites of qsos are correlated , the distribution of @xmath33 should be more narrow than the distribution of @xmath28 , making it a more efficient discriminator between rlqs and rqqs .",
    "the @xcite vla observations of bright qsos had sufficient sensitivity to divide most of them into an rqq population defined by @xmath36 and an rlq population defined by @xmath37 , with few qsos falling in the @xmath38 gap . @xcite and @xcite noted that large errors in the magnitudes , positions , and redshifts of bqs objects resulted in substantial bias and incompleteness in the bqs , raising questions about the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "even so , several subsequent radio observations and analyses of other qso samples appear to support their two - population description @xcite .",
    "however , the claim of two distinct populations was further challenged by a number of other authors who found continuous distributions of @xmath28 or @xmath33 with no clear gap separating rlqs from rqqs . using 1.4 ghz radio data from the first survey , @xcite",
    "all reported no evidence for two separate populations , although these conclusions were all based on samples defined by radio surveys , which are highly biased toward the radio - loud population .",
    "moreover , with a @xmath39 catalog limit , first can not detect rqqs individually , so @xcite lowered their noise limit by stacking over 40,000 first images of sdss qsos .",
    "unfortunately , the resulting mean flux density is dominated by the very small number of sources just below the first catalog limit @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the apparent bimodality claimed by others is the result of bias related to the strong dependence of radio on optical luminosity , but this argument has been refuted by @xcite .    using their 20 ghz radio data",
    ", @xcite found no evidence for a separate population of rlqs and rqqs in a sample of 874 x - ray selected quasars , but their x - ray selection biases the sample toward blazars and the 20 ghz atca observations barely reach down into the rqq population .",
    "terlevich and colleagues @xcite were the first to propose that nearly all qso emission ( radio , optical continuum , and even the broad emission lines ) is powered by starbursts rather than by supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) . for at least a few of their quasars , @xcite , and more recently @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "presented evidence for radio structures extending beyond the host galaxy of stars , radio components with very high surface brightnesses , variability , or apparent superluminal motion , all of which are characteristic of radio emission driven by a smbh .",
    "however , given that these quasars all lie near the @xcite @xmath40 boundary between the rqq and rlq distributions , they do not provide evidence that rqqs are smbh - powered .",
    "@xcite noted that most seyfert galaxies and rqqs obey the far - infrared / radio correlation @xmath41 obeyed by nearby star - forming galaxies , while radio - selected galaxies and rlqs have @xmath42 .",
    "if far - infrared / radio luminosity ratios are used to _ define _ the rlq and rqq populations , then their sample qsos have a strongly bimodal distribution in @xmath43 .",
    "@xcite suggested that the rqqs and seyfert galaxies are spiral galaxies whose radio emission is due to disk star formation , while radio - selected galaxies and rlqs are elliptical galaxies with smbh - powered radio emission .",
    "this scenario suggests that radio sources in rqqs and rlqs are powered _ either _ by star formation _ or _ by agns , but rarely by both .",
    "thus , like optically selected elliptical galaxies , many qsos should be `` radio silent , '' with radio luminosities well below those of normal spiral galaxies .",
    "@xcite discovered that the distribution of @xmath44 has few sources with @xmath45 , a distinct `` bump '' centered on @xmath46 and a long , flat tail extending to @xmath47 .",
    "this distribution is not bimodal , but neither is it featureless , so it still suggests two populations of qsos  those in the radio - quiet bump and those in the radio - loud tail . @xcite",
    "used nvss data to statistically find similar 1.4  ghz flux - density distributions in a much larger volume - limited sample of 1313 sdss qsos with redshifts @xmath48 and for a magnitude - limited sample of 2471 bright ( @xmath49 ) high - redshift ( @xmath50 ) qsos .    in narrow redshift ranges ,",
    "luminosities are strongly correlated with flux densities , so the 6 ghz luminosity functions have similar bumps and tails as the flux density distributions .",
    "spectral luminosities are more fundamental than observed flux densities because they are intrinsic source properties independent of redshift or distance . @xcite and @xcite suggested ( but could not prove ) that low - redshift `` bump '' radio sources with 6  ghz luminosities @xmath51 and high - redshift sources with 6  ghz luminosities @xmath52 are powered more by star formation in the host galaxy than by the agn that drives the very luminous optical and infrared emission , while the more luminous `` tail '' radio sources are primarily agn - powered .    in this interpretation ,",
    "( 1 ) the total radio luminosity of any qso is the _ sum _ of its star - formation and agn - powered contributions , and ( 2 ) most qso host galaxies are currently forming stars .",
    "their median star - formation radio luminosity ranges from @xmath53 ( about the luminosity of m82 ) for low - redshift qsos just brighter than the @xmath54 optical luminosity cutoff to @xmath55 ( about the luminosity of arp 220 ) for the most luminous high - redshift qsos in the universe ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the relevant measure of radio loudness is neither the radio flux density @xmath35 nor the radio  optical flux density ratio @xmath34 ; it is the radio spectral luminosity @xmath57 .",
    "the boundary separating rlqs from rqqs is not an arbitrary flux density or radio  optical flux density ratio ; it is the radio spectral luminosity above which the agn component usually dominates and below which the star - forming galaxy component contributes significantly .",
    "this boundary ranges from @xmath58 for the least luminous _ bona fide _ qsos ( @xmath59 ) found at low redshifts to @xmath60 for the most luminous qsos ( @xmath56 ) usually found at higher redshifts .",
    "the radio luminosity function of the agn - powered sources alone is so broad and flat that starbursts contribute more than agns to the total radio luminosities of most qsos .",
    "if most rqqs are in star - forming galaxies , not just `` red and dead '' elliptical galaxies , the typical `` radio quiet '' qso should have a total radio luminosity slightly higher than that of its host galaxy alone , and there should be almost no `` radio silent '' qsos .",
    "consequently , there is a `` bump '' in the _ total _ radio luminosity function of qsos , and that bump peaks just above the typical luminosity of the star - forming component @xcite .",
    "although some qsos have intermediate levels of luminosity or @xmath34 , there is no evidence for a separate class of radio - intermediate quasars whose radio emission is driven primarily by an smbh , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "rather , as described above , we believe that the radio emission from quasars with @xmath61 is due to a mixture of agn and star forming activity .    using sub - mjy sources selected from a radio survey of the chandra deep field @xcite , @xcite",
    "have noted that the radio emission from radio - quiet agns is also driven by a mixture of smbhs and star formation , and they derived separate evolving luminosity functions for these two populations .",
    "we note , however , that few of the agns identified from these sub - mjy radio surveys are _ bona fide _",
    "qsos with @xmath25 .",
    "although half a century has passed since the recognition of rqqs , there is still no consensus whether the rlqs represent a separate population of qsos , or whether they are simply the high luminosity tail of an essentially continuous radio luminosity distribution .",
    "moreover , if rlqs are indeed a separate population , why are only a small fraction of qsos strong radio sources ?",
    "a number of possibilities have been discussed including : + * stellar or black hole mass , accretion rate , or black hole spin * ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite proposed that the main difference between rlqs and rqqs is associated with black hole spin .",
    "black holes are spun up by recent galaxy mergers , and the radio jets of rlqs extract their energy from rapidly spinning black holes . however , there is no evidence for black - hole spin powering of jets in x - ray binaries @xcite , and the role of bh spin in powering quasar radio jets remains uncertain @xcite . + * intermittent activity * : the radio emission from quasars varies with characteristic times scales of months to years .",
    "typically , the flux density varies by considerably less than an order of magnitude .",
    "longer - term periods of more enhanced brightness would be required to explain the apparent two populations of rlqs and rqqs , and for the extended radio - loud sources , as suggested by the apparent double - double quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , time scales of at least @xmath62 to @xmath63 years would be needed .",
    "however , @xcite report that rlqs and rqqs show similar variability on time scales of months , and they suggest that in both classes of qsos , the radio emission is `` intimately associated with the active nucleus . ''",
    "+ * absorption * : both synchrotron self absorption and free - free absorption are known to be important in rlqs . possibly absorption could suppress most of the radio emission and give rise to an apparently radio - quiet population . however , if this were the case we would expect the division between rqqs and rlqs to be much stronger at lower frequencies , and there is no evidence for this ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "+ * host galaxy properties * : @xcite and others have investigated the host galaxies of qsos and found a mixture of early and late type galaxies , although @xcite report that for qsos with @xmath64 ( for @xmath65 , or @xmath66 for @xmath67 ) `` the hosts of both rlqs and rqqs are virtually all massive ellipticals . ''",
    "thus it appears that the radio loudness of _ bona fide _",
    "qsos is not determined by host galaxy morphology . + * relativistic doppler beaming * : almost all of the most luminous rlqs exhibit superluminal motion apparently reflecting relativistic doppler beaming ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as first suggested by @xcite , it is natural to try to interpret rlqs as the subset of isotropically oriented qsos whose relativistic beams are aligned close to our line of sight and so have relativistically boosted radio flux densities .",
    "however , as discussed in section  [ sec : radioloud ] , there are several problems with this apparently attractive interpretation .",
    "in order to avoid the pitfalls encountered by earlier radio studies of qsos , as reported by @xcite , we selected a complete sample of qsos satisfying all of the following : + ( 1 ) sdss colors well outside the stellar locus in the @xmath68 color cube @xcite .",
    "sdss objects were targeted for spectroscopic follow - up by more than one algorithm . to avoid any bias toward qso candidates favored for spectroscopic confirmation because they were detected by the 1.4  ghz first survey @xcite",
    ", we considered only those qsos chosen on the basis of color . + ( 2 ) at least one broad emission line with @xmath69 for spectroscopic confirmation of an agn .",
    "+ ( 3 ) @xmath70 to exclude seyfert nuclei and other low - luminosity agns .",
    "+ ( 4 ) @xmath0 .",
    "this narrow redshift range minimizes the effects of evolution and the degeneracy between luminosity and redshift .",
    "the low maximum redshift @xmath71 ensures that sensitive vla observations can detect sources with luminosities only a few times that of the milky way , @xmath72 .",
    "combined with the requirement that @xmath73 , @xmath74 also implies @xmath75 after correction for extinction according to @xcite .",
    "this is brighter than the sdss completeness limit for qso spectroscopy , so our qso sample is truly volume limited .",
    "our sample qsos are labeled in the sdss quasar catalog with the flag `` low @xmath76 '' @xcite , as the sdss targeting algorithm happens to be particularly efficient for the identification of low - redshift quasars .",
    "+ ( 5 ) the @xmath77  sr sdss area bounded by @xmath78 , @xmath79 is large enough to yield a statistically useful number @xmath80 of color - selected qsos in the @xcite quasar catalog of the seventh data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite .",
    "we later found that one qso , j1107 + 080 , is badly confused by an unrelated strong radio galaxy only @xmath81 away in projection but at a much lower redshift ( section  [ sec : sourcenotes ] ) . as we can not obtain useful radio data for j1107 + 080 and have no reason to believe that j1107 + 080 is intrinsically different from the other sample qsos , we excluded it and used only the remaining 178 qsos in the following analysis .",
    "we observed using the vla c configuration with a central frequency of 6 ghz and a bandwidth of 2 ghz in each of the two circular polarizations . with natural weighting",
    "the synthesized beamwidth was @xmath82 fwhm .",
    "we separated the target qsos into three groups to optimize the observing time .",
    "about one - third had already been detected as radio sources by the first @xcite and/or the nvss @xcite surveys with 1.4 ghz peak flux densities @xmath83 per @xmath84 beam or @xmath85 per @xmath86 beam , respectively .",
    "we re - observed these relatively strong sources for only @xmath87 at each of two widely different hour angles .",
    "all other sources were first observed for @xmath88 each .",
    "those that were clearly detected with @xmath89 after @xmath88 were observed for @xmath88 more at a different hour angle .",
    "the fainter remaining sources were re - observed for a total of 30 to 35 minutes , resulting in rms noise levels as low as @xmath90 , which corresponds to a 6  ghz spectral luminosity @xmath91 at @xmath71 .",
    "observations of the target quasars were interspersed approximately every 20 minutes with a phase and amplitude calibrator .",
    "the flux density scale was determined relative to the source 3c 286 which was observed once each day .",
    "the data were all analyzed within aips .",
    "after editing for rfi , the data were calibrated , the 16 sub - bands combined , then imaged and cleaned in the aips task imagr using an 0.2 arcsecond cell size and natural weighting .",
    "the images typically covered 200 to 400 arcseconds on a side with resolution of 4 by 5 arcseconds . where needed to suppress the contamination from a strong source elsewhere in the field , or to enhance the dynamic range of any extended structure , we did one or more rounds of self - calibration .",
    "we used the aips task jmfit to measure the peak flux density , angular size , and position of each compact radio component and the aips task imean to measure total flux densities of complex extended sources .",
    "the systematic position uncertainties are @xmath92 and @xmath93 for the compact radio and optical objects , respectively . the rms uncertainty in the radio  optical offset @xmath94 contributed by noise alone is @xmath95 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : radoptoff ] in all but two cases , there is an apparently unresolved radio source near the qso position .",
    "although we describe all flux densities as measured at 6 ghz , because of the very large bandwidth used , this is strictly true only if the spectral index is zero . in the more general case for a source with spectral index @xmath96 @xcite , @xmath97^{1/\\alpha } ~ ,   \\quad ( \\alpha \\neq -1)\\ ] ] so for a flat bandpass in the range @xmath98 ghz and @xmath96 = -0.7 , the `` effective '' frequency at which the wideband flux density equals the actual source flux density at 6.00 ghz is 5.952 ghz , and the reported flux densities at 6.00 ghz are too high by 0.56 percent . in the extreme case where @xmath96 = -1 , the `` effective '' frequency is 5.94 ghz , and the reported flux densities too high by 0.94 percent .",

    "we consider all but j1034 + 605 and j1021 + 190 to be robust radio detections of radio emission from sdss quasars . even if one of the low-@xmath140 detections is not real ,",
    "the corresponding sdss qso is still radio quiet , with maximum flux density well below the @xmath141 peak of the radio - quiet distribution , and our conclusions are unchanged .",
    "in figure  [ fig : slrhisto ] we show the logarithmic distributions of measured flux densities @xmath142 , the ratios @xmath34 of radio ( 6 ghz ) to optical ( @xmath101 mag ) flux densities , and the 6 ghz spectral luminosities @xmath143 for all 178 sources remaining in our sdss sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : slrpeakhisto ] shows the same distributions based on peak flux densities in the @xmath82 beams coincident with the qsos .    in each of these distributions , we clearly see the presence of two populations as reported earlier by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one has 6 ghz spectral luminosities @xmath144 .",
    "we suggest that the radio emission from these rqqs is the result of active star formation in the host galaxies , and the other more luminous but much smaller population is probably directly related to the central engine associated with the smbh which powers the optical luminosity .",
    "we note that the distributions in figures  [ fig : slrhisto ] and [ fig : slrpeakhisto ] are very similar , so the radio - loud population can not result from the extended emission alone .",
    "we also recalculated the 6 ghz qso luminosity function in the redshift range @xmath0 using our new flux densities and upper limits .",
    "it is shown in figure  [ fig : rlf6 ] and is similar to figure  2 in @xcite , the most obvious difference being the tighter upper limit to @xmath145 below @xmath146 because four of the six formerly undetected qsos were detected in the reprocessed data .      the 6 ghz radio luminosity @xmath147 \\approx 22.4 $ ] of the rqq peak ( solid curve in figure  [ fig : rlf6 ] ) and the median spectral index @xmath148 @xcite of low - redshift rqqs are characteristic of radio emission by relativistic electrons accelerated in supernova remnants of young stars , and they differ from the flat - spectrum optically thick sources almost exclusively associated with agn .",
    "our hypothesis that the radio emission from rqqs is primarily due to star formation in the host galaxy and is unrelated to the smbh @xcite is supported by @xcite , who reported evidence for ongoing star formation even in the elliptical host galaxies of qsos .",
    "radio emission from galaxies with active star formation is tightly correlated with fir emission and is characterized by the ratio @xmath149 or @xmath150 . the 6 ghz radio luminosity function",
    "that we attribute to star formation ( short dashed curve in figure  [ fig : rlf6 ] ) peaks at @xmath151\\approx 22.3 $ ] and corresponds to a star - formation rate @xmath152@xcite .",
    "we note that the absolute radio luminosities of our rqqs are far below the sensitivity limits of nearly all published qso studies , which have higher flux - density limits and/or include qsos with higher redshifts .",
    "they are also far below the traditional @xmath153 \\approx 25 $ ] boundary often used to distinguish rlqs from rqqs @xcite .    as we do not have fir data for our sdss sample , following @xcite , @xcite , and others , we have looked at the distribution of @xmath154 ( figure  [ fig : mirradio ] ) based on band 4 wise observations and our 6 ghz vla data . while figure  [ fig : mirradio ] does reflect the separation between the radio - loud and radio - quiet populations , we do not see the strong correlation between the @xmath155 and 6 ghz flux densities that is characteristic of radio - fir comparisons .",
    "this is not surprising as the measured @xmath155 flux densities are probably dominated by warm dust heated by the agn @xcite and so are not a clean measure of star - forming activity in qsos .    in principle , radio emission resulting from star formation may be distinguished from black hole agn emission by examining the radio spectral index . for the radio loud sample ,",
    "we have compared our 6 ghz images with the 1.4 ghz first and nvss images . as is characteristic of radio loud quasars and radio galaxies ,",
    "our radio loud sample is a mixture of flat spectrum cores and steep spectrum extended structure consistent with an agn origin , but there is no corresponding data for the rqqs at other wavelengths .",
    "ideally one might determine radio spectra of the rqqs just using our 16 separately calibrated sub - bands which cover the frequency range from 5 to 7 ghz .",
    "however , as shown by @xcite ( eqn .",
    "52 ) , the uncertainty in spectral index calculated in this way is @xmath156 10/snr . as seen from figure 7 , the typical rqq has a flux density @xmath156 100 microjy , where the snr is about 15 .",
    "thus for the typical rqq the rms uncertainty in the spectral index would be @xmath1561 , or not very useful to discriminate between a star formation or agn origin .",
    "recently @xcite and @xcite have proposed that the radio emission from many rqqs is synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons that are accelerated by moving shocks in organized quasar outflows , rather than by star formation .",
    "their proposal was motivated by their observed correlation between radio luminosity and outflow velocities measured from [ oiii ] @xmath157   emission - line blueshifts in a sample of 568 obscured luminous type ii quasars in the sdss .",
    "however , 386 of the 568 quasars were detected with @xmath158 by first @xcite . by our criterion , this is a sample dominated by radio - selected quasars , not optically selected qsos .",
    "their median spectral luminosity is @xmath159 at @xmath160 , or @xmath161 for sources with @xmath162 .",
    "this is well above the radio luminosites of sources that we suggest are powered by star formation in the host galaxies of low - redshift qsos ( figure  [ fig : rlf6 ] ) , and it would indicate an `` astonishing '' @xmath163 star - formation rate @xcite . we agree that the radio emission from these quasars is not starburst - powered , but their quasar population does not overlap our rqq population .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have detected milliarcsecond structure in 5 rqqs , which they argue is evidence for an agn driven basis for radio emission in rqqs .",
    "their radio sources have a 1.4 ghz luminosity greater than @xmath156 @xmath164 , the value that is characteristic of rqqs at redshifts @xmath156 1.5 @xcite .",
    "however , we do not exclude the possibility that there is a mixture of agn and star forming activity that contributes to the high end of the rqq luminosity function .",
    "@xcite found a `` bump '' peaking near @xmath165 in the normalized qso count @xmath166 contributed by 74 faint ( @xmath167 and @xmath168 ) higher - redshift ( @xmath169 ) video qsos .",
    "they concluded that this radio emission is predominantly powered by accretion onto smbhs .",
    "again , the typical radio luminosity in this bump is so high that we do not expect that it can be explained by star formation in low - luminosity qsos .",
    "our criterion that rqqs have radio spectral luminosities low enough to be explained by star formation ( @xmath170 ) excludes most qsos that have been called rqqs in the literature .",
    "thirteen rlqs show extended radio structures , all but perhaps two of which are spread over some tens of arcsec or @xmath171  kpc , or much larger than the host galaxy of stars .",
    "thus it is clear that at least this large scale structure is due to the agn and can not , as suggested by terlivich and collaborators , be due to star formation .",
    "following the widespread recognition of relativistic beaming as the cause of apparent superluminal motion and rapid flux density variability in rlqs , @xcite made the elegant suggestion that rlqs are just the subset of quasars whose relativistic beams are oriented nearly along the line of sight .",
    "previous radio observations of optically selected qso samples appeared inconsistent with this simple beaming interpretation .",
    "however , the limited sensitivity of these early observations combined with poorly defined qso selection criteria , use of inappropriate statistics , and differing criteria for separating rlqs from rqqs led to quantitative disagreements with the @xcite model .",
    "specifically , it appeared that too many optically selected qsos appeared radio loud and that the observed detection rate as a function of decreasing flux density was not consistent with simple beaming models .",
    "in view of recent improved observational studies and our increased understanding of relativistic beaming ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we decided to revisit relativistic beaming models to see if the observed radio - loud / radio - quiet dichotomy for the parsec - scale emission can be explained simply by orientation effects .",
    "following @xcite , in appendix a we derive the expected radio source count for a population of randomly oriented relativistic jets assuming that the optical emission is unbeamed .",
    "as shown by equation  [ eqn : nsslopes ] , the differential number @xmath172 of detected radio sources between @xmath35 and @xmath173 follows a simple a power law @xmath174 whose exponent @xmath175 depends only slightly on the spectral index and geometry of the relativistic beam . for realistic values of spectral index and geometry @xmath176",
    ", so the number of detected radio sources is expected to increase moderately with decreasing flux density .    considering only the compact components ( column 9 of table 1 ) of the radio loud sources alone",
    ", we found a best fitting @xcite power law index of @xmath177 for the differential source count based on the 18 sdss sources stronger than 5 mjy .",
    "this is marginally steeper than expected from beaming models with flat ( @xmath178 ) spectra which are characteristic of compact blazars .",
    "however , our sample is small , and due to the small redshift and corresponding small volume of our sdss sample , the radio luminosities are low compared with the more powerful , but more rare rlqs , so we would not expect beaming to be very strong in these sources .    using 1.4 ghz nvss data for 163 sdss qsos stronger than 2.4 mjy and in the redshift range 0.2 @xmath179 , @xcite reported @xmath180 , which is consistent with beaming models . for a sample of 191 more luminous optically selected quasars in the flux - density range @xmath181 , and redshift range @xmath182 , @xcite determined @xmath183 , which is too large ; that is , the observed source count is too `` flat '' , increasing too slowly as the flux density decreases .",
    "the @xmath184 lower limit @xmath185 is consistent with equation  [ eqn : nsslopes ] only for unreasonably steep spectral indices @xmath186 . in each case , the quoted uncertainties refer to the statistical uncertainty only .",
    "complications such as oblique shocks , a range of intrinsic luminosities or component velocities , contamination by unbeamed lobe emission , etc . only make it harder for beaming to match the data .",
    "another early objection to the beaming model arose because of the unexpected large fraction of optically selected qsos that appeared to be radio loud .",
    "because the radiation is beamed into a solid angle @xmath187 , with typical observed values @xmath188 , it was argued that less than 1 percent of optically ( randomly oriented ) qso should appear radio loud , whereas most investigations found 10 to 15 percent to be radio loud .",
    "however , in estimating the fraction of optically selected qsos expected to be radio loud qsos , the assumption of typical lorentz factors @xmath27 may not be appropriate .",
    "although samples of radio selected blazars may have typical lorentz factors @xmath27 , as shown by @xcite and @xcite , the corresponding much larger parent population is dominated by sources with smaller lorentz factors and corresponding larger beaming angles .",
    "furthermore , the number flux density distribution predicted from beaming models assumes a simple model with a straight and an infinitely thin jet with a pattern speed equal to the particle speed .",
    "however , none of these simplifying assumptions are precisely met in practice @xcite , particularly the assumption of straight jets without bends . also , we note that if the optical emission is also beamed , then even optically selected qsos will be favorably oriented along the line of sight .",
    "finally , in the so called unified models , an obscuring torus may block optical and ir radiation for those qsos which are oriented close to the plane of the sky , so that even without consideration of optical beaming , the orientation of even optically selected qsos may be biased to favor orientations close to the line of sight @xcite .",
    "the extended radio emission seen in more than half of our rlqs also represents a clear challenge to the @xcite relativistic beaming interpretation of the radio - loud / radio - quiet dichotomy .",
    "the five rlqs with asymmetric large - scale structure might be accommodated within modest relativistic beaming models , and indeed such an interpretation is supported by the facts that parsec and kiloparsec scale structures of rlqs are generally oriented in the same direction @xcite and that rlqs with kiloparsec - scale structures tend to have somewhat slower measured superluminal velocities in the corresponding parsec - scale structures @xcite .",
    "however , the nearly half of the rlqs with two - sided extended structure implies little or no differential doppler boosting suggesting that the orientation of doppler boosting is not the major effect separating the rlqs from the rqqs .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : slrpeakhisto ] the distributions of peak ( parsec scale ) flux densities @xmath116 , radio - optical ratios @xmath34 , and radio luminosities @xmath143 are all similar to the corresponding distributions derived from total flux densities .",
    "thus it is clearly not the extended emission alone that distinguishes rlqs from rqqs .",
    "we have reprocessed the vla observations of a sample of sdss qsos discussed in @xcite , and generated a catalog of radio sources associated with each qso .",
    "we confirm the idea that qso radio emission comes in two flavors , as indeed some have argued for decades , and strengthen the suggestion made in @xcite that the emission in most luminous objects is associated with smbhs , while the emission in the less luminous objects that dominate the sample is associated with the formation of stars in the host galaxies .",
    "we detected radio emission at 6 ghz from all but two of the 178 color - selected sdss qsos contained in our volume - limited sample of qsos more luminous than @xmath189 and with redshifts @xmath190 .",
    "about 20% of these qsos have 6 ghz source - frame luminosities @xmath191 , high enough that smbhs are probably needed to power most of their radio emission ; we call these radio - loud qsos ( rlqs ) .",
    "the rlq radio luminosity function is flat and featureless . extrapolating it to lower luminosities",
    "indicates that the radio power from many smbhs should be much less than @xmath192 .",
    "radio - quiet qsos ( rqqs ) cause a `` bump '' in the qso luminosity function spanning @xmath193 \\lesssim 23 $ ] , and `` radio - silent '' qsos fainter than @xmath194 are actually quite rare , accounting for not more than 1% of all qsos .",
    "we suggest that the rqq `` bump '' is evidence for radio emission powered by star formation in qso host galaxies , and the lack of radio - silent qsos is evidence that most rqq host galaxies are forming stars at least as fast as the the milky way .",
    "thus rlqs and rqqs may represent two separate populations whose radio emission is dominated by distinctly different energy sources .",
    "these populations can be distinguished only by very sensitive radio observations of low - redshift qsos .",
    "nearly all published attempts to distinguish such rlqs from rqqs have not reached the necessary luminosity level , @xmath5 .",
    "many of the rlqs show extended structures , most of which are rather symmetrically located about the parent qso . while relativistic beaming may play a role in the determining the parsec - scale radio flux densities of some qsos , the presence of rlqs with symmetric extended structures would seem to require that another mechanism as well is important in determining whether or not a qso becomes radio loud .",
    "moreover , the flux - density distribution of the rlq population does not seem to be consistent with simple relativistic beaming models .",
    "after 50 years of studies of qso radio dichotomy , technology has finally advanced enough to provide clues for the behavior of radio - quiet objects .",
