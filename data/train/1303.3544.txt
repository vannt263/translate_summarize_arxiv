    "a major issue in mesoscopic physics is the study of the sample sizes for which macroscopic properties emerge in finite systems @xcite .",
    "a typical context for such a study is provided by systems exhibiting quantum coherence , e.g. superconductivity or superfluidity , in samples with restricted size or number of particles : the general question is then to determine when and how quantum coherence takes place .",
    "the subsequent study is relevant in a number of situations , ranging from the investigation of superfluidity of @xmath1 droplets @xcite to bose - einstein condensation in atomic gases with small number of particles @xcite .",
    "a prototypical example of these studies of quantum coherence in mesoscopic interacting systems is given by the investigation of the limit size of a metallic grain needed for the occurrence of superconductivity @xcite : this and related questions are conveniently studied by using the richardson model ( rm ) @xcite .",
    "the rm describes a system of attractively interacting fermions and is paradigmatic in characterizing pairing in systems with a finite number of fermions @xcite : its relevance is also due to the remarkable feature of being exactly solvable @xcite and to the fact that it is possible to derive the thermodynamic limit of its exact solution and show that it precisely coincides with the bcs solution @xcite .",
    "the rm has been first studied in the context of nuclear physics @xcite , where the attraction leading to the pairing is due to the short - range nature of the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction @xcite .",
    "it was subsequently shown to be deeply connected with the exactly solvable gaudin magnets @xcite , through the relation between the respective integrals of motion @xcite .",
    "using such relation , the richardson model was then extended to more general classes of exactly solvable pairing - like models @xcite .",
    "the rm is particularly relevant for the study of finite - size scaling effects in the bcs theory of superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the classic bcs approach to superconductivity @xcite in the presence of a pairing interaction violates particle number conservation @xcite : number fluctuations are negligible in the thermodynamic limit , but important for small number of particles @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the rm is used in the analysis of ultrasmall metallic and superconducting nanograins @xcite : experiments on such systems are actually performed at a fixed number of electrons @xcite due to their large charging energy .",
    "the richardson model was successfully used in clarifying many features of the tunneling spectra of @xmath2 nanograins @xcite , where , for instance , the spectroscopic gap between grains with an odd or even number of electrons was explained with the existence of pairing correlations among these @xcite .",
    "it is a known general fact that when two superconducting or superfluid systems are weakly coupled a supercurrent flows between the two systems , with the current depending on the relative phase between the two superconducting or superfluid systems @xcite .",
    "the importance of this josephson effect stems from the fact that it describes coherent tunneling between superfluid / superconducting systems , and this description is in most cases independent on the details of the microscopic description of the uncoupled systems and of the concrete physical realization of the weak link between them . in this paper",
    "we intend to investigate how a definite relative phase emerges between two mesoscopic finite - size attractively interacting systems modelled by rms and how it is possible to extract it from the time - dependent many - body wavefunction : we find that this happens even for very small total number of pairs ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this occurs when the `` bulk '' interaction ( i.e. , the paring interaction of the uncoupled systems ) is such that the equilibrium properties of the uncoupled models are rather well approximated by the large-@xmath4 bcs theory .",
    "once the phase is formed and extracted from the many - body wavefunction , it is then possible to determine the current - phase portrait and study the josephson effect in such mesoscopic weakly coupled fermionic systems .",
    "our results can be primarily applied to weakly coupled ultrasmall metallic grains @xcite , but they could be also useful in connection with cold atom experimental setups in which the trapping potential contains a small number of fermions ( like @xcite ) and such traps are set at a distance that allows tunneling : this would be the atomic counterpart of superconducting ultrasmall grains coupled by tunneling terms .",
    "the fate of the josephson effect between small superconducting grains was investigated to some extent in @xcite , studying the dependence of the josephson energy as function of the level spacing and focusing on a parameter regime where the notion of a superconducting phase variable is not valid .",
    "another application of the richardson model is to the study of the bcs - bec crossover in finite size fermionic systems @xcite .",
    "the bcs - bec crossover is a subject which has been thoroughly investigated , also in connection to experimental realizations with ultracold fermions @xcite . increasing the ( bare ) attractive interaction among fermions , the chemical potential decreases with respect to the non - interacting fermi energy value , so that a crossover between a bcs state , characterized by loosely correlated , widely overlapping cooper pairs , to a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , in which pairs are tightly bound and minimally overlapping ,",
    "can be identified @xcite . within the formalism of the richardson model , the corresponding finite-@xmath4 version of the bcs - bec crossover @xcite , as well as the josephson effect ,",
    "can be studied .    in this paper",
    "we numerically investigate the josephson dynamics of two weakly coupled richardson hamiltonians .",
    "our motivation for such an investigation is three - fold .",
    "from one side we are interested in characterizing the superfluid behavior of the system at finite number of particles , with regard to its phase coherence , and in investigating for which values of the number of particles a definite relative phase between the two systems is formed : we find that the system behaves coherently even for a rather small total number of pairs ( as low as @xmath5 ) we introduce and discuss a way to extract from the many - body wavefunction the relative phase and its variance , so to quantify in a precise manner whether a well definite relative phase emerge .    when the relative phase is well defined , we are then interested in understanding and characterizing the effects of the pairing interaction coefficient @xmath6 ( giving rise in the uncoupled models to the bcs - bec crossover ) on the coupled dynamics while varying the pairing interaction coefficient",
    ". we will be mostly interested to values of coupling @xmath6 such that the uncoupled models have level occupation amplitudes close to the large-@xmath4 results .",
    "finally , our work aims at providing the exact josephson dynamics between two weakly coupled fermi systems with small number of fermions across the bcs - bec crossover .",
    "theoretical studies of tunneling of ultracold fermions across the bcs - bec crossover recently appeared @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the tunneling across a barrier potential was studied by solving numerically the bogoliubov - de gennes equations at zero temperature : the josephson current was found to be enhanced around the unitary limit . for vanishing barriers ( i.e. large coupling between the two fermi systems ) , the critical current approaches the landau limiting value @xcite .",
    "results obtained from the numerical solution of the bogoliubov - de gennes equations were compared with the analytical predictions derived from a hydrodynamic scheme , in the local density approximation @xcite : whenever such approximation is valid ( small and intermediate barriers ) , good agreement was found . in general , it is instead more difficult to obtain solutions of the bogoliubov - de gennes equations for very large barriers @xcite i.e. , when the coupling between the two fermi systems is weak .",
    "furthermore , one would also like to explore the exact tunneling dynamics and eventually compare it with the time - dependent solution of the bogoliubov - de gennes equations , which has been successfully used to study the dynamics of soliton solutions in trapped superfluid fermi gases @xcite .",
    "the model which is studied in the present paper , although necessarily restricted to small number of particles , exploits the integrability of the two uncoupled richardson systems and allows to compute the exact dynamics when a state with non - vanishing initial number imbalance and/or relative phase is prepared , offering the opportunity to extract the dynamical phase portrait .",
    "another advantage is that it is possible to investigate , in a simplified setting , how the josephson energy depends on the interaction and the tunneling strength : we find that the josephson energy has a maximum around the unitary limit , in agreement with results in literature obtained at @xmath7 in the large-@xmath4 limit for small and intermediate barriers @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in section [ sec : richardson ] we review the main properties of a single ( i.e. , uncoupled ) richardson model .",
    "the model with two coupled richardson hamiltonians is introduced in section [ sec : coupled ] , where we also discuss the main properties of the spectrum .",
    "the josephson dynamics is studied in sections [ sec : phase]-[sec : dyn ] : in section [ sec : phase ] we introduce the considered initial states for the dynamics and we discuss the emergence of a definite relative phase among the two richardson systems . in section [ sec : dyn ] we discuss the dynamical phase portrait , plotting the trajectories in the space of the relative phase and the population imbalance , and we present our results for the critical current as a function of the coupling .",
    "we draw our conclusions in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the richardson hamiltonian is written in terms of the operators @xmath8 destroying fermionic particles in the energy levels @xmath9 with spin @xmath10 : @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ richardsonhamiltonian ] ) the @xmath12 are the single - particles energies of the @xmath4 levels , @xmath6 is an interaction coefficient with the dimensions of an energy : in the following @xmath6 is assumed to be positive ( corresponding to attraction among fermions ) and it models the matrix element of the scattering among cooper pairs of spin - reversed fermions .",
    "the model is integrable for any choice of the set of energies @xmath12 - in the following we will consider them to equally spaced , according @xmath13 where @xmath9 and @xmath14 is the level spacing : this is indeed the choice usually done in order to recover the bcs physics in the thermodynamic limit ( see more details below ) @xcite .",
    "the richardson hamiltonian ( [ richardsonhamiltonian ] ) conserves the number of fermions and , separately , of fermion pairs ( doubly occupied levels ) .",
    "an essential feature of the spectrum is the so - called `` blocking '' effect @xcite : the states which are singly occupied , i.e. those in which there is only one electron with either @xmath15 or @xmath16 spin , are unaffected by the interaction and the net effect arising from their presence is that of `` blocking '' the level by preventing the scattering of the other pairs on it .",
    "the full hilbert space is then divided into sectors with a given number of unpaired fermions and in each of these subspaces the hamiltonian ( [ richardsonhamiltonian ] ) only couples the doubly occupied ( `` unblocked '' ) levels among them , while leaving singly - occupied levels effectively decoupled from the dynamics . denoting the number of pairs by @xmath17 , it is customary to write a reduced hamiltonian for the @xmath18 paired fermions in the @xmath4 unblocked levels as : @xmath19 where we introduced the ( hardcore ) pair creation and annihilation operators @xmath20 notice that the hilbert spaces on which the hamiltonian ( [ richardsonhamiltonian_bosons ] ) acts are subspaces of the full space of ( [ richardsonhamiltonian ] ) , characterized by given configurations of blocked levels .",
    "an hamiltonian equivalent to ( [ richardsonhamiltonian_bosons ] ) can be written by introducing the anderson pseudospin-@xmath21 operators @xcite : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 . in terms of the @xmath25 algebra generators , up to a constant , one has @xmath26 explicit solutions of the dynamics generated by the hamiltonians",
    "( [ richardsonhamiltonian_bosons ] ) and ( [ richardsonhamiltonian_spins ] ) has been presented and discussed in @xcite .",
    "the exact ( not normalized ) eigenstates of ( [ richardsonhamiltonian_bosons ] ) are constructed by applying a set of generalized creation operators @xmath27 on the reference state @xmath28 as follows : @xmath29 where the reference state is the one in which no hardcore bosons are present : @xmath30 the explicit form of the creation operators is @xmath31 and the set of complex number @xmath32 ( referred to as rapidities ) satisfies the set of algebraic equations @xmath33    the number of rapidities corresponds to the number of cooper pairs in the state and the action of the operator ( [ richardsonb ] ) is that of creating a boson , with a given amplitude on each level @xmath34 , as results from the interaction with all the other cooper pairs , which in turn is encoded in the system ( [ richardsonequations ] ) . in the limit @xmath35",
    "all the roots of the richardson equations ( [ richardsonequations ] ) are real and coincide with a given subset of fields , so that each boson is localized on a definite energy level . on the other hand , when @xmath6 is moved to nonzero values , roots can be present in complex conjugated pairs . in particular , for @xmath35 , the ground state for a given number @xmath17 of pairs",
    "is the one in which the lowest @xmath17 levels are filled ; in the strong coupling limit @xmath36 all the roots of this state come in complex pairs ( except for the most negative one , when @xmath17 is odd ) and their absolute value diverges .",
    "the bcs equations can be obtained from this solution in the limit @xmath37 while keeping constant filling @xmath38 , energy range @xmath39 and effective coupling strength @xmath40 . in this limit , the root configuration associated to the ground state assumes the shape of an arch in the complex plane , whose extrema are at @xmath41 as shown in @xcite , the link of the finite-@xmath4 results with the large-@xmath4 bcs theory is provided by the fact that @xmath42 and @xmath43 satisfy in the scaling limit previously defined the bcs equations @xmath44 and",
    "@xmath45    the richardson mode is integrable by means of algebraic bethe ansatz @xcite : not only the spectrum and the eigenstates , but also matrix elements @xcite and correlation functions @xcite are exactly computable . in particular , given two states @xmath46 and @xmath47 defined as in ( [ bethestate ] ) with @xmath17 rapidities , one can make use of @xmath48,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is a @xmath50 matrix defined as @xmath51 @xmath52 is given by @xmath53_{j , k }   = \\frac{\\prod_{l\\ne k}(v_l - v_k)}{(w_j - h_\\alpha)};\\ ] ] moreover , the following relation will be also used : @xmath54 in which the state @xmath46 has now @xmath55 rapidities and the @xmath56 matrix @xmath57 is defined as : @xmath58      the richardson model exhibits two types of crossover behavior : first , the crossover from bulk to few fermions , i.e. from large to small @xmath4 @xcite . in this case the richardson model is used to study the corrections to the large-@xmath4 bcs theory @xcite and in general how the physical quantities are modified when the number @xmath4 is not large and the energy scale @xmath14 explicitly plays a role .",
    "since we will numerically study the spectrum and the dynamics of coupled richardson models , the size of the considered systems will be necessarily finite .",
    "moreover , we will need to solve the equations ( [ richardsonequations ] ) to determine the eigenstates , which is best done when the spacing @xmath14 of the levels is kept finite while increasing the number of levels .",
    "it is then convenient to define an intensive richardson gap @xcite , which is related to the bcs gap @xmath42 by @xmath59 in which the quantity @xmath42 can be extracted from the ground state solution of the richardson equations ( [ richardsonequations ] ) : it is found that @xmath60 @xcite . in the large-@xmath4 limit ,",
    "the correlation functions are given by @xmath61 where the @xmath62 s enter the bcs variational ansatz for the ground - state @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the study of the comparison between the correlation functions given by ( [ uandvfrombcs ] ) with those directly from the richardson model shows that increasing @xmath6 the agreement becomes better and better : e.g. , as one can sees from fig .",
    "5 of @xcite one has a rather good agreement already for @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "we can then conclude that for values of @xmath4 considered in the rest of the paper one has for uncoupled systems a rather good agreement with large-@xmath4 results .",
    "the behavior of @xmath43 , the real value of the extremes ( [ arch ] ) of the arch formed by the bethe roots in the complex plane for large values of @xmath4 and @xmath6 , depends in general on the filling , and it is @xmath66 for fixed values of the initial population imbalance , below half filling .",
    "an important point to be stressed is that in the thermodynamic limit the quantity @xmath43 , as defined from the root configuration , tends to the chemical potential obtained for attractively interacting fermions in the bcs - bec crossover @xcite .",
    "we then can argue that the other crossover taking place in the richardson model is the bcs - bec one : for large @xmath4 the parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 satisfy eqs .",

    ", therefore a bcs - bec crossover takes place @xcite .",
    "a description of the bcs - bec crossover in the framework of the integrable richardson model was given in @xcite , where the model ( [ richardsonhamiltonian_bosons ] ) was considered in the thermodynamic limit and it was argued there that root configurations at strong enough coupling can be used to identify the boundaries of the crossover . in figure",
    "[ fig : scaling ] we plot @xmath43 as a function of @xmath6 for different values of @xmath4 as determined from eq .",

    "note that , whenever @xmath69 , the chemical potential becomes more and more negative while increasing @xmath6 : at some point , it crosses the real axis to negative values , signaling the crossover .",
    "notice that in the bcs scaling @xcite , in which the level spacing goes to zero as the inverse of the size , the crossing point tends to a finite value of @xmath6 in the thermodynamic limit , whereas in the considered equally spaced model ( [ eq - spac ] ) the crossing occurs at a value of @xmath6 which is instead @xmath70 .     per level versus @xmath71 , as computed from eqs .",

    "in this section we introduce the model studied in the rest of the paper featuring two richardson models coupled by a tunneling term @xcite : @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the `` right '' and `` left '' richardson hamiltonian , written in terms of the right and left operators @xmath76 ( the fermionic operators will be denoted by @xmath77 and @xmath78 with @xmath10 ) .",
    "we consider the simpler setting in which the two models have the same value of the coupling @xmath6 and the same energy levels @xmath12 : @xmath79 with the @xmath12 s equally spaced and given by ( [ eq - spac ] ) .",
    "the number of levels is taken to be equal to @xmath4 both for the left and the right systems .",
    "the total number of pairs in the system is denoted by @xmath80 - we will also denote by @xmath81 and @xmath82 the operators of the number of pairs in the left and right system : @xmath83 ( with @xmath84 ) .",
    "we write the tunneling term describing the hopping of a single fermion from one system to the other in the form @xmath85 ( with @xmath86 having the dimension of an energy ) .",
    "following the usual approach initially introduced by josephson @xcite , using second - order perturbation theory one can derive an effective hamiltonian for small values of @xmath87 ( corresponding to the regime of weakly coupled richardson hamiltonians ) : it turns out the this effective hamiltonian can be written only in terms of the pair operators @xcite , greatly simplifying the study of the dynamics .    since the uncoupled hamiltonians ( [ richardsonhamiltonian_bosons_r ] ) contain only interactions among pairs , the eigenstates of ( [ richardsonhamiltonian ] )",
    "can be classified in terms of their _ seniority _ @xmath88 , i.e. , the number of the unpaired electrons .",
    "the second order effective tunneling term can be written as : @xmath89 in which the sum runs over all the possible intermediate states that can be reached from a @xmath88-seniority couple of states @xmath90 , by removing an electron of spin @xmath91 from the level @xmath92 of the right grain and adding it on the level @xmath93 on the left grain ( or viceversa ) . in ( [ scdordtunn ] )",
    "the quantity @xmath94 is the corresponding excitation energy relative to the initial state .    following @xcite , it is possible to limit the space of states on which the intermediate sum runs over to the lowest energy ones , when acting with ( [ scdordtunn ] ) on the lowest - energy states of the two uncoupled systems in which all fermions are bound into cooper pairs . in facts ,",
    "the energy @xmath94 includes the energy needed to break a pair and the effect of the blocking of the states on the collective excitations on both subsystems .    across the whole bcs - bec crossover ,",
    "the breaking of a pair associated with the tunneling of a single electron is energetically depressed : processes like the ones depicted in figure [ fig : processes](a)-(b ) are suppressed by a factor @xmath95 in the dynamics , since they involve both the breaking of a pair , with an energy cost equal to the bcs gap @xmath42 and the blocking of a level , which affects all the levels and has therefore an energy cost roughly proportional to @xmath4 . at second order in the fermion tunneling , it is more convenient to reach a final state in which only cooper pairs are present @xcite .",
    "moreover , single - fermion tunneling does not produce a current in the absence of an applied driving force , so they will not affect the current .",
    "this is true in particular for processes like the one in figure [ fig : processes](c ) , which reproduces the initial state and can be included in a redefinition of the energies of the unperturbed system .",
    "we are therefore led to consider as dominant the coherent pair tunneling , which involves both the electrons of a cooper pair and can be directly written in terms of the bosonic operators @xmath96 or @xmath97 , as in figure [ fig : processes](d ) .",
    "assuming the two systems to have a definite relative phase ( as it will be checked and discussed in section [ sec : phase ] ) , the coherent tunneling involves a phase shift on the state in which it takes place and a corresponding variation of the relative number of fermions @xmath98 [ see figure [ fig : processes](d ) ] .    ) . , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=20.0% ] ) . , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=20.0% ] ) . , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=20.0% ] ) .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=20.0% ]    we therefore focus on coherent pair tunneling , for which the effective hamiltonian is @xcite @xmath99 where @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 . as can be seen in eq .",
    "( [ pair - tunnel ] ) , we decided to scale the tunneling coefficient with @xmath42 since this is the relevant scale throughout the crossover and it is a finite quantity in the thermodynamic limit ; furthermore , the form ( [ pair - tunnel ] ) ensures that the tunneling acts as a perturbation also on the bcs side and for small values of @xmath6 .",
    "the form ( [ pair - tunnel ] ) is particularly relevant since it formalizes the fact that preparing the system in its ground state and adding a weak fermionic tunneling term to the uncoupled richardson hamiltonians does not destroy the cooper pairs picture : this provides a major simplification in the problem , allowing for to study the josephson problem only in terms of hardcore bosons since the subspaces with different seniority will not be accessed neither by the `` single - site '' dynamics of the uncoupled richardson systems , nor by the coupling between different sites ( see a discussion on the single - fermion tunneling effects at the end of section [ sec : phase ] ) .",
    "the ground - state state of hamiltonian @xmath103 was studied in @xcite and the behavior of the josephson energy investigated as a function of the level spacing .",
    "integrable versions of coupled pairing hamiltonians was proposed and studied in @xcite , while an analysis of the spectrum of two weakly coupled richardson hamiltonians with @xmath104 was presented in @xcite .    in the following we consider the hamiltonian @xmath103 , with @xmath105 given by ( [ pair - tunnel ] ) and we investigate the properties of its spectrum and the dynamics starting from an state at time @xmath106 having an initial relative phase difference and/or an initial population imbalance : we are interested to ascertain for what values of @xmath4 a relative phase difference @xmath107 is well defined , and to study the dynamics in terms of the time evolution of @xmath108 and @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the difference between the number of pairs of the two systems defined by eq.([delta_m ] ) . note that , in general , the gap and the chemical potential appearing in ( [ pair - tunnel ] ) will be functions of time as well . however , for the sake of simplicity , we will consider them as constant , which in the present case stands as an approximation valid for small fractional population imbalance .",
    "the initial state is prepared in the following way ( see more details in section [ sec : phase ] ) : the uncoupled system ( @xmath111 ) is initially in the ground state , characterized by a definite occupation number on the left and on the right parts - then , at time @xmath106 , the coupling @xmath112 is turned on and the quantum dynamics is studied .",
    "integrability plays an important role both in the study of spectrum and dynamics : it gives the exact eigenstates of the two uncoupled systems and , most importantly , the exact hopping matrix elements .",
    "it also provides an efficient truncation mechanism to select the most important eigenstates in the dynamics : as we discuss in the following , one can avoid to diagonalize the hamiltonian written on a basis of the full hilbert space of the coupled problem and instead limit its size by restricting only to a subset of states .",
    "operatively , we start from the basis of the exact eigenstates of the two uncoupled models , with @xmath111 , with the number of pairs on the left ( @xmath81 ) and on the right ( @xmath81 ) separately conserved . once fixed the total number @xmath113 of pairs , the factorized basis @xmath114 is split into subsectors ,",

    "the single - level occupation numbers are good quantum numbers for the system : it follows that all the excitations above the fermi sea ground state induced by the coupling , in the regime in which the tunneling coupling is small ( @xmath121 ) , are the states in which one particle is missing from the fermi sea or one particle is added above it .",
    "these are a subset of the `` particle  hole '' states , obtained from exciting one pair from below to above the fermi level , which are instead there at second order .    in the opposite limit @xmath120 , it is useful to rewrite ( [ richardsonhamiltonian_bosons ] ) in terms of spins , obtaining the spin hamiltonian ( [ richardsonhamiltonian_spins ] ) : in the strong coupling limit @xmath120 , the hamiltonian ( [ richardsonhamiltonian_spins ] ) reads @xcite @xmath122 ( where @xmath123 ) and it conserves the total spin of the state and its @xmath124-projection .",
    "numerical solutions of the richardson equations show that the rapidities can either diverge proportionally to @xmath6 or remain finite , with real part which lies `` trapped '' between two energy levels . in the strong coupling limit , the tunneling hamiltonian . consequently , the states group into highly degenerate total spin subspaces @xcite . in the strong coupling limit ,",
    "the tunneling hamiltonian ( [ scdordtunn ] ) simplifies as well : the bcs gap diverges linearly with @xmath6 and all the pairs of levels in ( [ pair - tunnel ] ) factorize a common term , yielding @xmath125 ( where @xmath126 and where @xmath127 ) .",
    "the ground state is the unique state in which all the rapidities diverge in the strong coupling limit and it is the one with highest ( total ) spin .",
    "the relation between the number @xmath128 of diverging roots at strong coupling and the eigenvalues of the spin hamiltonian ( [ richardsonhamiltonian_sc ] ) is @xmath129 @xcite , being @xmath130 and @xmath131 the total spin projection along the @xmath124 axis .",
    "one then sees that it is sufficient to restrict the single - site hilbert space to the root configurations with one less ( or one more ) rapidity and the same number of rapidities which diverges at large @xmath6 , i.e. , again the ground state of the new sector : therefore , no new state is needed .",
    "although the previous arguments are valid in the two limiting regimes @xmath119 and @xmath120 , we numerically compared the results with exact diagonalization ( for @xmath132 ) or the effect of adding more total spin subspaces to the dynamics ( for @xmath133 ) .",

    "algorithms for connecting the number of roots that eventually diverge to the initial state configurations have been given in @xcite : the included states are exemplified in figure [ fig : part - hole ] and consist of the evolution in @xmath6 of all the configurations in which , in the weak coupling limit , one particle is excited from the fermi sea to right above its surface or from the fermi energy to one more energetic state .        the algorithm used for solving the richardson equations",

    "the main limitation of this protocol arises from the consume of ram by diagonalization subroutines : by limiting subspaces appropriately , as discussed in section [ sec : coupled ] , one can study systems up to @xmath175 levels ( both on left and right systems ) .",
    "an important issue we want to address in this section , arising from the fact that we can treat the exact quantum dynamics of the coupled model only for a limited number of pairs , is whether a definite relative phase emerges at small sizes . in the presence of the tunneling term ( [ scdordtunn ] ) , eigenstates will in principle be written as a combination of many of the factorized states of the two uncoupled hamiltonian .",
    "nevertheless , as we will see , when the initial population imbalance is small , the number of involved states is rather small .",
    "moreover , even for higher particle imbalance , when the tunneling is weak and the pairing strength is strong enough , the hilbert space of each system organizes in subspaces , labeled by eigenvalues of the total spin ( see section [ sec : richardson ] ) .",
    "it follows that in most cases , even if the exact states involved are many , the corresponding energy eigenvalues are not very different , therefore the time evolution takes place with nearly definite phase .    note that in our canonical setting the expectation value @xmath176 is always vanishing , since the @xmath177 s operators does not conserve the number of particles .",
    "however , we can define time - dependent phase differences between one level in a system and a level in the other system systems by the use of the formalism of section [ sec : richardson ] evaluating the dynamical two - point functions ( for the uncoupled systems , dynamical two - point correlations have been studied @xcite ) .    from the correlation function",
    "@xmath178 one can extract how much the phases of two distinct levels differ at a given time .",

    "conversely , larger population imbalances at @xmath106 are projected to many states in the middle of the spectrum , each having its own energy .",
    "we pause here to comment about fermion tunneling : as a matter of fact , the original tunneling hamiltonian ( [ tunneling_hamiltonian ] ) is written in terms of fermionic operators , while the result that the phase coherent behavior is established with relatively small pairing and/or total number of pairs is obtained with the bosonic approximation ( [ pair - tunnel ] ) , acting on the restricted subspace of blocked levels .",
    "since at small @xmath6 pair - breaking excitations may play an important role , a natural question to ask is whether the presence of fermionic degrees of freedom , aside of bosonic pairs , may spoil the phase - coherent behavior of the systems for sufficiently large pairing .",
    "the issue can be rephrased into the question of whether the initial state , during the evolution generated by the coupled hamiltonian , containing a fermionic tunneling term , may give rise to a huge number of states in which two or more electrons are not paired , evolving incoherently with respect to the states in which only pairs appear .",
    "these states have to be written as linear combinations of the factorized states of the two uncoupled hamiltonians . on each site",
    ", the energy of such states can be exactly computed for any value of @xmath6 . in order to have an estimation of a lowest bound for the energy , we can consider a state in which the most energetic pair is broken and one electron is promoted into the next level , which reduces the number of pairs by @xmath215 and the number of unblocked levels by @xmath216 , as seen in section [ sec : richardson ] .",
    "the energy of the lowest pair - breaking excitation has been considered in @xcite and it reads : @xmath217 the bare energies in the first term of ( [ pairbreak ] ) do not depend on @xmath6 , unlike the ground state energy , all the pair - conserving excitations and the second term in the previous equation .",
    "it follows that , by taking the pairing strength sufficiently high , all pair - breaking excitations can be made to lay at arbitrary energy above the ground state and are therefore suppressed with respect to pair - conserving excitations .",
    "checking explicitly that the insertion of states with unpaired electrons does not spoil the phase relation requires much larger computational effort , in that the hilbert space should be enlarged to the @xmath218 configurations in which the @xmath144 electrons can `` block '' part of the @xmath4 levels , with fixed number @xmath17 of pairs .",
    "we can therefore qualitatively rely on the standard argument based on the presence of a gap preventing single - fermion tunneling : note that this should already hold for values of @xmath219 , as previously discussed .",

    "finally , we have presented the critical current as a function of the pairing parameter , finding that it has a maximum around the unitary regime , even with a number of pairs @xmath260 .",
    "the phase portrait was studied for small initial imbalances ( @xmath261 ) .",
    "the requirement of having a definite phase difference among the two systems with a limited total number of pairs ( @xmath262 ) prevented us to analyze values of the initial population imbalance ( @xmath263 ) : for these large initial imbalances the relative phase is well defined only for very strong pairing interaction , well beyond the unitary limit and deep in the bec regime .",
    "further numerical investigations are required to consider larger sizes and larger initial imbalances ( eventually with very small tunneling couplings ) , which may generate a definite relative phase across the bcs - bec crossover : it is expected that a proper finite - size scaling may be crucial to identity non - linear self - trapping effects .",
    "we moreover regard as interesting the investigation of the effects on the relative phase of single - fermion tunneling terms : these terms might give a contribution on the bcs side of the crossover and produce a degradation of the relative phase , which should eventually form for larger sizes .",
    "similarly , it would be stimulating to compare ( eventually for larger systems ) the results obtained from exact dynamics with the ones obtained using time - dependent mean - field approaches .",
    "the rapid growth of the computational cost with the size of the systems represents a limitation on the total number of pairs as well : the hilbert space could be further reduced in the strong coupling regime , yet not throughout the whole crossover .",
    "we conclude that it stands as an open issue , certainly deserving future work , how our findings scale with the size of the system .",
    "our results can be applied to weakly coupled ultrasmall metallic grains and to cold atom experiments in which traps with few fermions are set at a distance that allows tunneling : the individuation of the relative phase between nearest neighboring sites makes possible in perspective to study josephson dynamics and self - trapping systems also for larger imbalances , and to check the validity of two- and multi- mode ansatz .",
    "we finally observe that in this paper we focused our attention to weakly coupled richardson models , discussing the formation of a relative phase and the josephson dynamics for a class of considered initial conditions .",
    "the extension of our method of defining a relative phase to the problem of the formation of a relative phase between general interacting ( both integrable and non - integrable ) mesoscopic systems could be relevant in a rather broad class of physical systems , including weakly coupled ultracold finite bose gases , and it is in our opinion an interesting problem , worthwhile of future studies .",

    "also thanks a. de luca for collaboration on the implementation of the numerical solution of the richardson equations .",
