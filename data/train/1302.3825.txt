    "the progress in the field of supernova neutrinos over the past decade has frenetic .",
    "the rich phenomenology of neutrino collective effects @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) have received the most attention but there has been an equally radical overhaul of the mikheyev , smirnov & wolfenstein ( msw ) effect as applied to supernova ever since it was realized by schirato & fuller @xcite that the shockwave racing through the stellar mantle could leave an imprint upon the neutrinos emitted from the cooling proto - neutron star @xcite .",
    "recent studies indicate earth matter effects may be minimal @xcite . from this ever - growing body of literature one",
    "now expects that the neutrino signal from the next supernova in our galaxy will be pregnant with information .",
    "if the signal can be decoded we might be able to both determine any unresolved properties of the neutrino and also to observe the explosion while it is still deep within the star . yet most , though not all , of these studies use spherically symmetric density profiles either in a parametrized form or taken from one - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "while the use of one - dimensional hydrodynamical profiles for neutrino signal construction is probably adequate for certain situations - such as neutrinos from oxygen , neon , magnesium supernova @xcite which explode in spherically symmetric simulations - it is now apparent that iron core collapse supernova should not be expected to be spherically symmetric .",
    "large scale inhomogeneities are created deep within the explosion and one observes turbulence during the neutrino heating / standing accretion shock instability phase @xcite leading to the expectation of violent fluid motions and turbulence in the mantle as the shock is revived and moves outwards .",
    "like collective and shock effects , turbulence is another supernova feature that can leave its fingerprints upon the neutrino burst @xcite . at first glance turbulence is just a case of a more complicated msw effect but , upon further reflection , one realizes that the randomness of the profiles means the transition probabilities for a particular neutrino - the set of probabilities that relates the initial state to the state after passing through the supernova - along a given ray are not unique : they will depend upon the exact turbulence pattern seen by the neutrino as it travelled through the supernova .",
    "the transition probabilities are drawn from a distribution whose properties will depend upon the stage of the explosion , the character of the turbulence , and the neutrino energy and mixing parameters . when the mixing angle @xmath1 was unknown it was difficult to make robust statements about the effect of turbulence because at one value of @xmath1 the effects would be negligible , at another the turbulence would be endemic .",
    "the recent measurements of the last mixing angle @xmath1 by t2k @xcite , double chooz @xcite , reno @xcite and daya bay @xcite are all in the region of @xmath4 , significantly higher than the dighe & smirnov @xcite threshold , and it is now possible to be more definitive about the consequences of turbulence .    in this paper we consider the implications of the recent measurement of @xmath1 upon the neutrino transition probabilities as a function of the turbulence amplitude .",
    "our calculations expand upon the work of kneller & volpe @xcite upon which we shall rely heavily for the techniques used to calculate the turbulence effects and as reference for our results .",
    "we first describe the calculations we undertook then present our results for the turbulence effects when the turbulence amplitude is small , less than 1% comparing large and small @xmath1 .",
    "we then turn to large amplitude turbulence and compute the expectation values of the transition probability distributions in both neutrinos and antineutrinos again comparing large and small @xmath1 .",
    "we finish with a summary and our conclusions .",
    "the quantities we are interested in calculating are the probabilities that some initial neutrino state @xmath5 at @xmath6 is later detected as the state @xmath7 at @xmath8 . these probabilities are computed from the @xmath9-matrix which relates the initial and final states via @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath9-matrix is found by solving the equation @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the hamiltonian . in matter",
    "the hamiltonian is composed of at least two terms : the vacuum contribution @xmath13 and the msw potential @xmath14 .",
    "when solving for @xmath9 one must work in a particular basis and the basis determines the structure of the terms in the hamiltonian . in the ` mass ' basis",
    "the vacuum hamiltonian is diagonal and described by two mass squared differences @xmath15 and the neutrino energy @xmath16 . through this paper",
    "we shall use the values of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 which are consistent with present experimental values . in the flavor basis the off - diagonal elements are non - zero leading to the phenomenon of flavor oscillations .",
    "the two bases are related by the maki - nakagawa - sakata - pontecorvo @xcite unitary matrix parametrized by three mixing angles , @xmath21 , @xmath1 and @xmath22 , a cp phase and two majoranna phases .",
    "in contrast , the msw potential is diagonal in the flavor basis because the matter picks out the neutrino flavors .",
    "the common neutral current contribution to the msw potential may be dropped because it leads only to a global phase which is unobservable leaving just the charged current potential , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the fermi constant and @xmath25 the electron density , which affects just the electron neutrino / antineutrino i.e. the element @xmath26 .",
    "in addition to the msw potential , it has been found that the neutrino density in supernovae is so high that an additional potential due to neutrino self - interactions must be included .",
    "this neutrino self - coupling has been shown to lead to very interesting behavior but for our purposes the self - interaction is negligible when the turbulent region in the star has moved beyond @xmath27 so we shall ignore this contribution .    when the vacuum and matter terms are added together",
    "the hamiltonian is neither diagonal in the mass nor the flavor bases so one would expect oscillations of both the flavor and mass probabilities .",
    "these oscillations are a source of potential confusion for any analysis .",
    "a basis can be found which diagonalizes @xmath12 for a given value of the electron density in the sense that there is a matrix @xmath28 such that @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues .",
    "this basis is known as the matter basis which becomes the mass basis ( up to arbitrary phases ) when the msw potential disappears .",
    "the matter mixing matrix @xmath28 which achieves this diagonalization depends upon the position through the star therefore @xmath31 in general .",
    "the non - zero derivative of the matter mixing matrix re - introduces off - diagonal elements into the matter basis hamiltonian which will lead to mixing between the matter basis states if they become large .",
    "we refer the reader to kneller & mclaughlin @xcite and galais , kneller & volpe @xcite for a more detailed description of the matter mixing matrix .",
    "we shall report our results using the matter basis states throughout this paper .",
    "neutrino with mixing angle @xmath32 and mass splitting @xmath33 [ fig : profile ] ]    next we must introduce the turbulent density profile though which the neutrinos will propagate .",
    "ideally one would like to use density profiles taken from multi - dimensional simulations but at the present time that is not possible .",
    "the current multi - dimensional simulations do not extend out to the region of @xmath34 where the turbulence would have its greatest effects because the matter there has little bearing upon the explosion , and even if they did , they do not run to sufficiently late post - bounce times to see the shock move out there .",
    "finally , the dynamic scale the simulations would need to cover would be of order forty to fifty decibels - four to five orders of magnitude - because the neutrino oscillation wavelength is significantly smaller than the radius in the high - density resonance region and beyond .",
    "for these reasons the effect of the turbulence upon the neutrinos is most often modelled as a random field .",
    "we adopt a one - dimensional supernova profile from a hydrodynamical simulation and in order to facilitate comparison the profile we select is taken from kneller , mclaughlin & brockman and is the same profile used in kneller & volpe .",
    "this profile is shown in figure ( [ fig : profile ] ) . in the figure we find two shocks : the forward shock at @xmath35 formed from the core bounce , and the reverse shock at @xmath36 formed by the wind created above the proto - neutron star running into the material ahead of it . in multi - dimensional simulations of supernova both these shock fronts",
    "are distorted leading to strong turbulence in the region between them .",
    "but for this paper we shall use neutrino energies and mixing parameters such that the h resonance density does not intersect the shocks . the reason we avoid the shocks is twofold .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations typically yield ` soft ' shocks that do not cause transitions between the neutrino states if the mixing angle is too big .",
    "this lack of a transition is unphysical .",
    "the second reason is that we wish to focus solely upon the turbulence effect and diabatic msw transitions caused by the shocks complicates the interpretation . for these reasons we will use @xmath37 for the neutrino energy and the two - flavor resonance density for a @xmath37 is shown in the figure .",
    "the reader can verify that it does not intersect the profile at either shock .     in an inverted hierarchy ( top panel ) and",
    "@xmath38 in a normal hierarchy ( lower panel ) after passing through the density profile shown in figure ( [ fig : profile ] ) for a @xmath37 neutrino as a function of the mixing angle @xmath1 [ fig : p23,p13barvstheta13 ] ]    for future reference , the transition probability @xmath38 for a normal hierarchy and @xmath39 for an inverted hierarchy are very close to zero for this neutrino energy , and mass splitting of @xmath40 and a mixing angle given by @xmath41 .",
    "the reader may be surprised to see that the figure indicates the transition probabilities change from the diabatic limit , @xmath42 or @xmath43 , to the adiabatic limit @xmath44 or @xmath45 is not monotonic in the h resonance channel because of the aforementioned presence of the multiple h resonances in the profile .",
    "the multiple resonances leads to an interference effect which is sensitive to @xmath1 when @xmath46 for this neutrino energy , profile and mass splitting @xcite .",
    "the turbulence is introduced by multiplying the profile in the region between the reverse and forward shocks by a factor @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a gaussian random field with zero mean . since the quality of our results in this entire paper rests firmly upon us doing this well , it is worth our effort to explain carefully how @xmath48 was constructed .",
    "the random field is represented using a fourier series i.e.  .",
    "@xmath49 for radii between @xmath50 and zero outside this range .",
    "the two radii @xmath36 and @xmath35 are the positions of the reverse and forward shock respectively found in the underlying profile . in this equation",
    "the parameter @xmath0 sets the amplitude of the fluctuations .",
    "the two @xmath51 terms are included to suppress fluctuations close to the shocks and prevent discontinuities at @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and the parameter @xmath52 is a scale over which the fluctuations reach their extent size .",
    "we set @xmath53 . in the second half of equation ( [ eq : f3d ] )",
    "the members of the set of co - efficients @xmath54 and @xmath55 are independent standard gaussian random variates with zero mean thus ensuring the vanishing expectation value of @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath57 wavenumbers form a set @xmath58 with power spectrum @xmath59 and , finally , the parameters @xmath60 are k - space volume co - efficients to which we return shortly . the power spectrum of the random field was selected to be @xmath61 here @xmath62 is the cutoff scale , @xmath63 is the spectral index and @xmath64 is the heaviside step function .",
    "throughtout this paper we shall use a wavenumber cutoff @xmath62 set to @xmath65 i.e.  a wavelength twice the distance between the shocks and we shall adopt the kolmogorov spectrum where @xmath66 .",
    "the method of fixing the @xmath67 @xmath68 s , @xmath14 s , @xmath69 s and @xmath70 s for a realization of @xmath56 is ` variant c ' of the randomization method described in kramer , kurbanmuradov , & sabelfeld @xcite .",
    "this randomization method partitions the k - space into @xmath57 regions and from each we select a random wavevector using the power - spectrum , @xmath59 , as a probability distribution .",
    "the volume parameters @xmath60 are the integrals of the power spectrum over each partition if the power spectrum is normalized to unity .",
    "variant c of the randomization method divides the k - space so that the number of partitions per decade is uniform over @xmath71 decades starting from a cutoff scale @xmath62 .",
    "the logarithmic distribution of the modes is designed to ensure the quality of the agreement between the exact statistical behavior of the field and that of an ensemble of realizations is uniform over a the range of lengthscales considered i.e.   it is scale invariant .",
    "this feature is important for our study because the oscillation wavelength of the neutrinos is constantly changing as the density evolves .",
    "the evolution of the reduced oscillation wavelengths for the neutrinos - @xmath72 - and antineutrinos - @xmath73 - where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the differences between the eigenvalues @xmath76 and @xmath77 of the neutrinos and antineutrinos respectively - as a function of distance through the profile are shown in figure ( [ fig : deltak ] ) for both a normal and an inverse hierarchy when the mixing angle @xmath1 is set to @xmath78 and the energy is @xmath79 . again",
    "the reverse and forward shocks are indicated by the two vertical dashed lines .",
    "this figure can be used to determine a suitable value for @xmath71 because we observe that in the region between the shocks the typical wavelengths are @xmath80 which is the minimum lengthscale we need to cover @xcite .",
    "this is approximately 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the turbulence cut - off scale @xmath81 thus we deduce that we need to pick @xmath82 to cover the necessary decades in k - space .    with @xmath71",
    "determined we now seek a suitable value of @xmath67 by requiring that the statistical properties of an ensemble of random field realizations closely match the exact properties for the field .",
    "the statistical property we compute is the second order structure function @xmath83 given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the separation between two radial points .",
    "the function @xmath86 is related to the two - point correlation function @xmath87 via @xmath88 and for the power spectrum we have adopted we can compute the two - point correlation function analytically to be    @xmath89    where @xmath90 is the incomplete gamma function .     of the numerically calculated structure function to the analytic result as a function of @xmath91 .",
    "the two curves in the figure correspond to @xmath92 ( red solid ) and @xmath93 ( blue dashed ) . at every @xmath91 we generated @xmath94 realization of the field and the error bar on each point",
    "is the standard deviation of the mean .",
    "[ fig : grf1d ] ]    in figure ( [ fig : grf1d ] ) we show the ratio @xmath95 of the numerically calculated structure function to the exact solution as a function of the scale @xmath96 when we use either @xmath97 wavenumbers spread over @xmath98 decades or @xmath99 wavenumbers over @xmath100 decades .",
    "the numerical calculation is the average of @xmath94 realizations of the turbulence and the error bar on each point is the standard deviation of the sample mean .",
    "the figure indicates that the method we use to generate random field realizations reproduces the analytic results for the structure function very well and with high efficiency because good agreement between the statistics of the ensemble and the exact result requires just @xmath101 .",
    "in fact , like kramer , kurbanmuradov , & sabelfeld @xcite before us , we find even @xmath102 ratios of just @xmath103 are sufficient to give acceptable agreement .",
    "we re - assure the reader we shall stick with @xmath101 .",
    "with the construction of the random fields in place we can proceed to generate a turbulent profile and propagate neutrinos and antineutrinos through it . this construction and propagation recipe",
    "is then repeated a minimum of one thousand times - sometimes much larger - to construct an ensemble of transition probabilities of size @xmath104 .",
    "once we have our sample we can then go ahead and compute means @xmath105 , variances @xmath106 , etc .",
    "the hierarchy will be set to normal and we shall comment on how our results translate to the inverted hierarchy .",
    "the neutrino energy will be fixed at @xmath79 , typical of supernova neutrino energies .",
    "the turbulence effects - or lack of them - when using a value of @xmath1 close to the present measurements was not fully explored in previous studies so to make a connection with previous works , and to explain why a large value of @xmath1 gives the results that it does , we shall consider multiple values of @xmath1 in order to show what other possibilities would have produced in contrast .",
    "( solid line ) and the standard deviation @xmath107 ( dashed line ) as function of the mixing angle @xmath1 . the turbulence amplitude is set to @xmath108 and @xmath92 and the neutrino energy is @xmath37 .",
    "[ fig : p23vstheta13 ] ]    for small amplitude turbulence only the h - resonant channel is affected : mixing between states @xmath109 and @xmath110 for a normal hierarchy and states @xmath111 and @xmath112 for an inverted .",
    "previously it has been found that effects could appear in the neutrinos even for turbulence amplitudes in the range @xmath113 when the mixing angle was set at @xmath114 .",
    "if we allow the value of @xmath1 to float then we find the normal hierarchy h resonance channel transition probability @xmath38 can become more or less diabatic .",
    "this can be explained from the behavior of the diabaticity parameter @xmath115 @xcite , which characterizes the degree of mixing in the h resonance channel for a normal hierarchy .",
    "this quantity is inversely proportional to the difference @xmath116 between the eigenvalues @xmath117 and @xmath118 and proportional to the derivative of the matter mixing angle @xmath119 . increasing @xmath1 increases the eigenvalue splitting and also makes the resonance ` wider ' in the sense that the change between the limiting values of the matter mixing angle @xmath119 occurs over a greater extent reducing the matter angle derivative .",
    "both effects decrease the diabaticity and , for these reasons , reaching the depolarization limit for @xmath38 becomes more difficult if the domain of turbulence is fixed as is the case here .",
    "if the profile were changed so as to allow a larger turbulence region then eventually one should expect to reach the depolarization limit no matter what the mixing angle .",
    "a similar argument applies when @xmath1 becomes small : now the diabaticity increases as @xmath1 decreases because the splitting between the eigenvalues at the resonance decreases and the transition occurs more rapidly . either way ,",
    "as @xmath1 varies the distributions for the transition probability @xmath38 will differ from the uniform distributions seen in kneller & volpe leading to subsequent evolution of the expectation values and distribution variances .",
    "this evolution with @xmath1 is seen in figure ( [ fig : p23vstheta13 ] ) where we plot the mean value @xmath120 and the standard deviation of the samples from a single emission point as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "the reader should compare the evolution of @xmath121 in this figure with that in figure ( [ fig : p23,p13barvstheta13 ] ) .",
    "the mean value of @xmath120 has an inflection region between @xmath122 : for the smaller values of @xmath1 we see @xmath123 , for the larger @xmath124 and for @xmath125 the mean value of @xmath38 is almost zero .",
    "one also observes how the sample standard deviation changes as @xmath1 varies and sees that it is maximal at @xmath126 for the range @xmath127 and almost zero when @xmath125 .",
    "this figure shows how the measurement of @xmath1 has brought clarity to the issue of turbulence and supernova neutrinos . for @xmath1 outside the range",
    "@xmath122 the distribution of @xmath38 is essentially a delta function at either zero or unity ; for @xmath1 inside the range @xmath122 the distribution is uniform .",
    "thus when @xmath1 was unknown it was impossible to determine whether the effect of small amplitude turbulence was negligible or overwhelming .",
    "the measurement of a large value of @xmath1 indicates it is the former and the result has consequences for the observability of spectral features in the next galactic supernova burst signal .        for large amplitudes , @xmath128 , the effects of turbulence",
    "are no longer restricted to the h resonance channel but appear in numerous places . the first effect worth noting",
    "is that the distribution of the h - resonance channel transition probability , @xmath38 in the case of a normal hierarchy , becomes independent of @xmath1 .",
    "this can be seen in figure ( [ fig : p12,p13,p23vscstar ] ) where the reader will observe the evolution of the mean value of this transition probability @xmath120 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "for the two values of @xmath1 considered , the spread in @xmath120 at small amplitudes has disappeared by @xmath129 .",
    "we also notice that around this same turbulence amplitude there begins the shift to three - flavor depolarization where @xmath130 .",
    "in addition to the changes in the h - resonance channel we also begin to observe mixing in the l - resonance channel , between @xmath131 and @xmath109 as the amplitude grows .",
    "this simultaneous mixing between @xmath131 and @xmath109 and @xmath109 and @xmath110 breaks hl factorization and kneller & volpe gave two examples were given that explicitly showed broken hl factorization . for the neutrino mixing parameters we are using",
    ", the ratio of h and l resonance densities ( using the two - flavor formula ) is @xmath132 .",
    "this large ratio would seem to imply that we need fluctuations of order @xmath133 because only if @xmath134 would the density fluctuation give @xmath135 .",
    "three effects soften this requirement : the l resonance has a large width - @xmath136 , the density in the turbulence region can be much lower than the resonance density @xmath137 for the given neutrino energy - see figure ( [ fig : profile ] ) , and , finally , our choice of a gaussian random field for the turbulence will ensure that large fluctuations will occur occasionally no matter what we use for the amplitude , larger amplitudes just make the extremal fluctuations more probable .     for a turbulence amplitude is set to @xmath138 .",
    "the neutrino energy is @xmath37 and we used @xmath139 , @xmath98 for the turbulence generator .",

    "[ fig : f(p31 ) ] ]    the clearest signature of broken hl factorization is a non - zero transition probability @xmath142 because only if hl factorization is broken can we generate an effective mixing between @xmath131 and @xmath110 . to see this we consider the @xmath9-matrices for the case of factored hl resonances and broken factorization .",
    "the s - matrix for passing through one or several h resonances , @xmath143 , has the genreal form @xmath144 where @xmath145 and @xmath146 are cayley - klein parameters .",
    "similarly the s - matrix for l resonances , @xmath147 , is @xmath148 where @xmath145 and @xmath146 are cayley - klein parameters for the l resonance . if hl factorization holds then the @xmath9-matrix which describes the evolution for the neutrino through the entire profile is @xmath149 .",
    "if all the l resonances occur after the h resonances then we find the transition probability @xmath150 is identically zero .",
    "but if additional h and l resonances occur , denoted by @xmath151 and @xmath152 , then the @xmath9-matrix describing the neutrino evolution is of the form @xmath153 and @xmath154 will be non - zero . in figure (",
    "[ fig : f(p31 ) ] ) we show frequency distributions of the transition probability @xmath142 for neutrinos at two values of @xmath1 when @xmath138 .",

    "<S> the set of transition probabilities for a single neutrino emitted from a point source after passage through a turbulent supernova density profile have been found to be random variates drawn from parent distributions whose properties depend upon the stage of the explosion , the neutrino energy and mixing parameters , the observed channel , and the properties of the turbulence such as the amplitude @xmath0 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we examine the consequences of the recently measured mixing angle @xmath1 upon the neutrino flavor transformation in supernova when passing through turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> we find the measurements of a relatively large value of @xmath1 means the neutrinos are relatively immune to small , @xmath2 , amplitude turbulence but as @xmath0 increases the turbulence effects grow rapidly and spread to all mixing channels . for @xmath3 the turbulence effects in the high ( h ) density resonance mixing channels are independent of @xmath1 but non - resonant mixing channels are more sensitive to turbulence when @xmath1 is large . </S>"
