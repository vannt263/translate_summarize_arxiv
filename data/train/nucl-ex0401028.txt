    "this review is a `` dim sum '' of parity violation experiments . as with a luncheon ,",
    "my selection is biased by my personal taste and experience .",
    "i start with @xmath0 parity violation experiments , concentrating on the the triumf 221 mev @xmath0 experiment , then discuss @xmath3 parity violation experiments with details of the los alamos @xmath4 experiment now being installed at lansce .",
    "finally , i discuss @xmath6 parity violation experiments , particularly the gzero experiment at jefferson lab .",
    "i refer those interested in more background to specific reviews on nucleon - nucleon @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite experiments .",

    "they scatter a longitudinally polarized beam of protons from a hydrogen target and measure the difference in cross section for right - handed and left - handed proton helicities .",
    "the intermediate and high energy experiments use transmission geometry in which the change in scattering cross section is deduced from the change in transmission through the target .",
    "low energy experiments , where energy loss limits the target thickness , use scattering geometry , in which the detectors measure the scattered protons directly . both types of experiments measure the parity violating longitudinal analyzing power , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the scattering cross sections for positive and negative helicity .",

    "the long times taken to achieve small uncertainties reflects the time taken to understand and correct for systematic errors . in cases where authors reported both statistical and systematic uncertainties ,",

    "[ cols=\"<,<,^ , > \" , ]     [ epexp ]    the gzero experiment completed a successful commissioning run of the forward angle configuration in fall 2002 and january 2003 and all major systems are now fully operational .",
    "running will continue with an engineering run october to december , 2003 , and production running is scheduled to start in 2004 .",
    "parity violation experiments provide a way to study effects of the weak interaction in the presence of the much stronger electromagnetic and strong nuclear interactions .",
    "the polarized beam experiments i have described use similar experimental techniques and face similar problems controlling systematic errors .",
    "the physics addressed by these experiments can , however be quite diverse .",

    "@xmath0 parity violation experiments are sensitive to the shorter range part of the nucleon - nucleon force and constrain the combinations @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "finally , @xmath6 parity violation experiments , such as the jlab gzero experiment , offer the opportunity to measure the contribution of strange quark - antiquark pairs to the proton charge and magnetism .",
