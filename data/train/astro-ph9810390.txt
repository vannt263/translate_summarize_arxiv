    "the identification and study of very high - redshift galaxies ( @xmath6 ) is probably one of the most direct methods to constrain the scenarios of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the observation of such galaxies presents a major challenge complementing the statistical studies of lower redshift galaxies ( cfrs : lilly et al .",
    "1996 ; hawaii deep fields : cowie et al . 1996 ; hdf : sawicki et al . 1997 ; lowenthal et al . 1997 ; steidel et al .",
    "the key information to retrieve is the star formation history in the universe and the evolution of the different morphological types of galaxies .",
    "the main problems are the identification of high - z galaxies and the construction of a sample as bias - free as possible .",
    "steidel et al .",
    "( 1992 , 1993 , 1996a , 1997 ) first used the lyman dropout technique to photometrically identify @xmath7 galaxies in empty fields , and they succeeded in confirming spectroscopically a large sample of them with the keck telescope .",
    "a similar technique has been used on the hdf to identify @xmath8 galaxies ( steidel et al .",
    "1996b ; lowenthal et al .",
    "1997 ) also confirmed with the keck telescope .",
    "the number of massive star - forming galaxies at high redshift can be used to constrain the cosmological models ( see baugh et al .",
    "all these galaxies are in general very compact in their restframe uv , with the bulk of their star formation located on high surface - brightness regions",
    ". their morphologies might give some hints on the physical processes involved in galaxy evolution .",
    "in particular , they might provide useful constraints on the formation of the different systems ( spheroids , bulges , disks ) , and its close relation with metal enrichment timescales ( see trager et al .",
    "1997 for a detailed discussion ) . at @xmath9 3",
    "to 4 , the corresponding lookback time is 13.7 to 14.4 gyr , 15 gyr being the present age of galaxies ( @xmath10 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) .",
    "thus , such high redshift systems provide a direct measure of the early star - formation processes .",
    "the photometric technique based on the identification of lyman dropouts in the u - band has shown to be a useful tool to select @xmath8 galaxies , and it has been successfully extended to the b - band to locate @xmath14 candidates ( steidel et al .",
    "nevertheless , two major biases will appear in all such selection techniques : one towards intrinsically luminous galaxies because the sample is limited in apparent magnitude , and another towards galaxies with strong star - formation activity , because the rest - frame uv will be seen at the visible wavelengths .",
    "when high - redshift galaxies are selected through photometric redshift techniques based on a large wavelength domain , including near - ir , and close to critical - lines of cluster - lenses , the resulting sample is less sensitive to these biases .",
    "this paper presents the first @xmath15 results on this original method to build - up and study an independent sample of @xmath16 galaxies , by combining photometric redshifts ( visible and near - ir ) and lens modelling .",
    "one of the first examples of such a technique on lensed galaxies is the @xmath17 star - forming object in a2218 ( ebbels et al .",
    "1996 ) , and a number of recent discoveries of @xmath18 lensed - galaxies in clusters , sometimes serendipituous , strongly encourages this approach ( yee et al . 1996a ; trager et al . 1997 ; franx et al .",

    "the two @xmath15 lensed galaxies discussed in this paper were identified in the cluster abell 2390 ( @xmath19 ) , a gravitational lens which has been extensively studied .",
    "the first detailed photometric and spectroscopic surveys on this target were performed by le borgne et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , and recently enlarged by the cnoc group ( yee et al .",

    "a near - ir photometric survey is also available ( miralles et al .",
    "1999 , in preparation ) .",
    "we will focus here on two multiple images at @xmath2 , namely h3 and h5 , according to the nomenclature by kneib et al .",
    "( 1999 , see also figure 1 ) .",
    "the redshift of the former had already been confirmed by frye & broadhurst ( 1998 ) at the keck telescope .    a plan of the paper follows .",
    "first , we give a summary of the spectroscopic and photometric data in section 2 .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the study of the main properties of h3 and h5 , namely the spectroscopic and photometric redshifts , the lensing properties and the morphology of these objects .",
    "the stellar population of these objects is characterized in section 4 . in section 5 these results are discussed , with a special attention to the implications for galaxy formation and evolution . throughout this paper , we assume @xmath22 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 and @xmath13 .",
    "the photometric data were obtained during a number of runs since 1988 , at the 3.6 m canada - france - hawaii telescope , the 3.5 m telescope of calar alto ( caha , spain ) and the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( spain ) . we have selected the images obtained under photometric conditions .",

    "the main uncertainty is the @xmath42 for h3 , which could set the sfr to values @xmath65 times lower or higher than the best solution quoted above .",
    "the absolute b magnitudes were derived from the observed k magnitudes ( restframe @xmath56 3900 - 4430  ) , using the best - fit models for a detailed scaling : @xmath66 @xmath67 and @xmath68 @xmath69 for h3 and h5 respectively , with @xmath53 . in the case of h5 , this result is almost independent on the model sed because @xmath42 is always small ; in the case of h3 , the @xmath41 uncertainties in @xmath42 translate into @xmath70 magnitudes of uncertainty in @xmath71 .",
    "the shape of the continuum at wavelengths shorter than @xmath72   ( restframe @xmath73  ) , up to the i band , is relatively insensitive to the metallicity for metallicities higher than solar . the likelihood map is almost insensitive to age for ages below @xmath74 years , as expected given the sampling in stellar masses in the evolutionary tracks used by gissel98 .",
    "nevertheless , such time - scales seem irrelevant here , the best solutions being older than this limit .",
    "these results also are generally insensitive to the choice of the imf .",
    "nevertheless , the permitted regions in the likelihood maps show some dependency on the upper mass limit assumed for star - formation .",
    "in particular , when this limit is set to a value as low as @xmath75 , the permitted region for burst models is shifted towards younger age values for the stellar population , irrespective of the metallicity . this change on model details",
    "has very small influence on the sfrs derived above .",
    "the two sources h3 and h5 are at the same redshift , but their stellar populations are noticeably different . both of them are well fitted by burst or continuous star - formation models .",
    "metallicities much higher than @xmath46 seem to be excluded by the photometric data in the case of h3 , and they have a lower probability in h5 .",
    "both galaxies are roughly compatible with solar metallicities within the @xmath36 confidence level : @xmath76 for h3 and @xmath77 for h5 .",
    "the stellar population seen in h5 is younger than in h3 , on the basis of a burst model with @xmath54 .",
    "the main source of uncertainty when deriving the restframe properties of these objects is the value of @xmath42 , and this is clearly shown in the case of h3 where the @xmath41 uncertainties are @xmath78 magnitudes .",
    "the two sources are intrinsically bright : roughly @xmath79 for h5 and @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) magnitudes for h3 ( here @xmath79 is the local value , from loveday et al . 1992 ) .",
    "this , combined with the high gravitational amplification and the presence of relatively strong emission lines , has allowed us to obtain a spectroscopic redshift for these sources using a 4 m telescope . among the high redshift candidates in our sample behind a2390 , 4 additional ones are at the same photometric redshift . a subsequent spectroscopic survey using a 8 m class telescope",
    "is needed to go further on this study , especially to estimate more precisely the metallicities from uv absorption lines .    when comparing our results on h3 to those by frye & broadhurst ( 1998 ) and bunker et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we find them in fairly good agreement , after correction for the difference in the amplification factor , which is 3 times higher in their lens model .",
    "the age of the system and the reddening value given by bunker et al .",
    "for h3 are included within our @xmath26 best solution region , which is a remarkable result taking into account that both the photometric data ( hst excepted ) and the analysis are completely independent .",
    "the high amplification factor obtained by frye & broadhurst ( 1998 ) corresponds to the maximum value attained in our model for h3 , on the region neighbouring the critical line , but the surface - averaged value in our case is 3 times lower .",
    "compared to other known @xmath82 galaxies , h3 and h5 belong to the bright end of the field population ( lowenthal et al .",
    "1997 ; steidel et al .",
    "1996a and 1996b ) .",
    "they are slightly brighter than the @xmath15 objects found by trager et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in the cluster lens cl0939 + 4713 , although the amplification factor is poorly known in this case .",
    "they are also intrinsically brighter than the @xmath83 galaxy found by dey et al .",
    "these sources are not resolved in their width , where the lens inversion is limited by the resolution of the wfpc2 images ( about @xmath84 , @xmath85 kpc with @xmath86 ) , but they are resolved on their length . h3 and h5 are splitted into several small , compact and bright subclumps , all aligned towards the same direction .",
    "the total length of these emitting regions is similar to that of the compact cores of the @xmath87 field sample by steidel et al .",
    "( 1996a ) .",
    "h3 is more elongated than h5 , and probably more dusty .",
    "the linear separation between h3 and h5 ( @xmath88 with @xmath86 ) and their peculiar morphologies strongly point towards a hierarchical merging process as a likely scenario for the formation of the brightest spheroids .",
    "their photometric seds are compatible with a wide range of metallicities at a @xmath41 level , all with @xmath89 .",
    "nevertheless , as shown in section 4 , broad band photometry does not allow a precise estimate of the metallicity .",
    "a spectroscopic study using uv restframe absorption lines , or near - ir spectroscopy , is urgently needed for these purposes .",
    "a relatively high metallicity for the bright subclumps would imply that we are actually seeing an advanced step in this merging process , where stars are forming from a metal enriched gas ( see also trager et al .",
    "1997 ; lowenthal et al .",
    "1997 , baugh et al 1997 ; moscardini et al . 1997 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that we are dealing with local conditions in these star forming systems .",
    "the light detected is mainly emitted in very small and compact regions ( @xmath90 kpc ) , which could be highly enriched compared to the remainder of the source .",
    "this is fully compatible with the best fit metallicities being @xmath91 in these systems , because in this case the star formation becomes a local and efficient process , where the cooling rate is enhanced by metallic atoms allowing the formation of molecules and increasing the dust opacity .",
    "such a process is discussed in details in a recent paper by spaans & carollo ( 1998 ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the amplification factor for h3 and h5 is 0.3 magnitudes .",
    "this means that the intrinsic luminosities and sfrs are known with an accuracy of @xmath92 .",
    "this source of error has the same importance than the model uncertainties for a relatively well constrained sed ( i.e. , the uncertainty of @xmath93 magnitudes in @xmath42 for h3 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that h3 and h5 are multiple images , well modelled compared to other images in this or other cluster lenses .",
    "this gives an idea of the limitation arising from lens modelling when using clusters as gravitational telescopes to access the background sources .",
    "only the well constrained clusters are actually useful for this programme .",
    "h3 and h5 are the first spectroscopically confirmed images of sources at @xmath94 in this cluster , a redshift domain which is well constrained by the set of filters used here .",
    "the selection of high - redshift candidates using a photometric redshift approach , including the near - ir bands , is strongly supported by the present results . for most statistical purposes",
    ", photometric redshifts should be accurate enough to discuss the properties of these extremely distant galaxies .",
    "conversely , the spectroscopic confirmation of the redshifts of such gravitationally amplified sources could help on the calibration and improvement of the photometric redshifts techniques up to much fainter limits in magnitude compared to field surveys .",
