    "the determination of a quantum state is a highly nontrivial problem .",
    "a wave function itself , or more generally a density operator , is not an observable and can not be measured directly .",
    "one can see the state only through measurable quantities , which are related to the matrix elements of the density operator .",
    "it is therefore an interesting and important issue to discuss how to infer a given quantum state from a list of observed quantities .",
    "such a problem is called state reconstruction or state tomography @xcite .",
    "recent advances in technology have been enabling us to engineer variety of peculiar quantum states to explore fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics .",
    "generation of highly quantum states is one of the key elements for the realization of the ideas of quantum information @xcite .",
    "it is clear that such issues can not go without supports by the state reconstruction technology . probing nontrivial correlations in a quantum system also helps us to clarify intrinsic characters of various many - body systems .    from a practical point of view , direct accesses to target systems",
    "are often limited .",
    "in such a case , we have to explore a way to probe the target in an indirect way .",
    "scattering has always been considered a very powerful way to investigate many physical systems in a wide range of fields of physics , from elementary - particle physics to condensed - matter physics .",
    "loosely speaking , all the physical processes to access targets can be regarded as scattering processes .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the state tomography of a qubit ( spin-1/2 particle ) via scattering , in a simple 1d setup . we send a probe qubit to the fixed target qubit and see the state of the probe after its scattering off the target .",
    "its scattering data contain the information on the target state before the scattering , from which we reconstruct the state . in order to reconstruct the qubit state ,",
    "three independent scattering data are required .",
    "one possibility is to make use of the spin degree of freedom of the probe .",
    "a collection of three transmission / reflection probabilities with three different sets of the initial and final spin states of the probe provides sufficient information for the reconstruction of the target qubit state .",
    "notice here that in our setup , there is an additional ( spatial ) degree of freedom available in the scheme for the tomography of the spin , i.e. , the momentum of the probe .",
    "it will be shown that this degree of freedom can be utilized to  optimize \" ( in the sense prescribed below ) the scheme .",
    "it is interesting to see that the _ spatial _ degree of freedom can play a central role for the tomography of the _ spin_. it will be demonstrated that three scattering data required for the qubit tomography are available by arranging different incident momenta and scattering directions , with the initial and final spin states of the probe being fixed .",
    "suppose that a qubit @xmath0 is fixed at @xmath1 on a 1d line .",
    "we are going to discuss the reconstruction of its state , which is in general a mixed state @xmath2 , through the scattering data of a probe qubit @xmath3 off the target @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that the following hamiltonian describes the scattering process : @xmath4 here @xmath5 and @xmath6 are respectively the position and the momentum of the probe qubit @xmath3 of mass @xmath7 , and the potential produced by the fixed qubit @xmath0 is assumed to be represented by the delta function .",
    "when @xmath3 is scattered by @xmath0 , their spins interact with each other through the heisenberg - type interaction with a positive coupling constant @xmath8 , with @xmath9 being the pauli operators acting on qubit @xmath10 .",

    "the probe @xmath3 is sent from the left ( @xmath12 ) to the target @xmath0 with a fixed incident wave number @xmath13 , and scattered .",
    "the scattering ( s ) matrix element is given by @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the eigenstate of the free hamiltonian @xmath16 and @xmath17 that of the total hamiltonian @xmath18 , both belonging to the same eigenvalue @xmath19 , with @xmath20 denoting the spin degrees of freedom of two qubits .",
    "the coordinate representation of the latter reads as @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the retarded green function in 1d .",
    "it is easy to calculate the source term at @xmath23 , @xmath24 with a dimensionless parameter @xmath25 recall that the heisenberg - type coupling @xmath26 is rewritten as @xmath27 in terms of the projection operators @xmath28 onto the spin - singlet and -triplet eigenspaces , respectively .",
    "this allows us to evaluate the inverse operator as @xmath29 we therefore obtain @xmath30 where the scattering matrices responsible for transmission and reflection , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , read @xmath33 here the coefficients @xmath34 and @xmath35 coincide with the reflection and transmission amplitudes calculated separately for the spin - singlet(triplet ) eigenspace , in which the interaction hamiltonian is given by a scalar ( i.e. , not spin - dependent ) potential @xmath36 for the spin - singlet case or by @xmath37 for the spin - triplet case .",
    "this implies that the problem can be reduced to an ordinary scattering problem of a spinless particle .      in the tomographic schemes we are going to discuss in the following , the probe @xmath3 is sent with its spin polarized to the direction specified by a unit vector @xmath38 , and we see the probability of @xmath3 being transmitted or reflected with its spin rotated to @xmath39 .",

    "the target qubit @xmath0 is in general in a mixed state @xmath2 , which is characterized by a bloch vector @xmath45 such that @xmath46 the transmission probability for a given set @xmath47 reads as @xmath48 + c_t(\\omega)\\bm{v}\\cdot({\\bm n}_f\\times{\\bm n}_i)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath49 these coefficients are plotted in fig .",

    "[ cols= \" > \" , ]     observe that the transmission and reflection probabilities @xmath52 and @xmath53 are both spherically symmetric in spin space .",
    "this reflects the symmetry of the heisenberg coupling @xmath54 : no preferred direction is present in the system .",
    "let us now discuss the tomography of the state @xmath2 , through the scattering data @xmath55 . our objective is to determine the three independent components of vector @xmath45 , which exactly corresponds to the complete specification of the state @xmath2 , see ( [ target initial state ] ) . from an experimental point of view",
    ", this means that we need to arrange three independent experimental setups .",
    "as is clear from ( [ transmission_probability ] ) and ( [ reflection_probability ] ) , the scattering probabilities @xmath55 explicitly depend on the initial and detection orientations @xmath38 and @xmath39 of the spin of the probe qubit @xmath3 as well as on the parameter @xmath56 containing the incident wave number @xmath11 and the coupling constant @xmath8 ; we can consider different strategies for the tomography , by properly choosing these parameters . in the next subsections , we discuss two of such tomographic strategies , in which the spatial and spin degrees of freedom of @xmath3 play different roles .    in the first approach presented in sec .",
    "[ first strategy ] , a central role is played by the spin degree of freedom of @xmath3 : we tune the incident and detection orientations @xmath38 and @xmath39 of its spin , while the incident wave number @xmath11 is fixed . in order to completely reconstruct @xmath2",
    ", we arrange the orientations @xmath38 and @xmath39 in three independent ways .",
    "for instance , we can choose three different detection orientations @xmath39 with the orientation of the incident spin @xmath38 being fixed , or we can tune both of them at the same time .",
    "the remaining degree of freedom , the wave vector @xmath11 , also plays an active role : we can  optimize \" in the sense described below the tomographic scheme by tuning it appropriately .    in sec .",
    "[ par : second strategy ] , we discuss another approach , in which we fully make use of the spatial degree of freedom @xmath11 .",
    "the tomography of the _ spin _ state @xmath2 is possible through the _ spatial _ degree of freedom .",
    "we collect three independent scattering data for different incident wave numbers @xmath11 and scattering directions ( i.e. , transmission or reflection ) when the incident and detection orientations of the spin @xmath38 and @xmath39 are fixed , from which we reconstruct the spin state @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , one can follow the same criterion introduced for the first strategy in order to  optimize \" the tomographic scheme .      in this section , we reconstruct the initial state of the target qubit @xmath0 by tuning the incident and detection orientations @xmath38 and @xmath39 of the spin of the probe qubit @xmath3 with a fixed incident wave number @xmath11 .",
    "in particular , we discuss two possible examples of this first tomographic strategy .",
    "let us first fix the orientation of the spin of the incident qubit @xmath3 , @xmath38 , and choose three different detection orientations @xmath57 , which can be chosen to be orthogonal to each other .",
    "for instance , choosing @xmath58 perpendicular to @xmath38 , @xmath59 would be a natural choice as a reference frame .",
    "the transmission probabilities associated to these detection orientations with a fixed wave number @xmath11 read @xmath60 where @xmath61 are the three independent components of the target vector @xmath45 along the axes of the reference system @xmath62 introduced above and @xmath63 the transmission probability when the spin of @xmath3 is detected along direction @xmath64 .",
    "the three components of the vector @xmath45 are readily obtained by inverting the relation ( [ trasmission_first_strategy ] ) as @xmath65\\ ] ] with @xmath66 which completes the reconstruction of the state @xmath2 .",
    "observe that the only condition needed to be satisfied in order to invert the matrix in ( [ trasmission_first_strategy ] ) to obtain @xmath67 in ( [ m_t ] ) is @xmath68 , which can be considered as a self - consistency condition for the present tomographic scheme .",
    "another example of this first strategy , which is simpler from a computational point of view , is detecting the spin @xmath3 oriented in the same direction as the incident spin , @xmath69 . in this case",
    ", the transmission probability reads @xmath70 from which we immediately obtain @xmath71 by choosing three different orientations for @xmath72 , we gain the complete information on the vector @xmath45 , that is , on the state @xmath2 .",
    "observe that also in this case the self - consistency condition reads @xmath68 .",
    "similar schemes are available with reflection probabilities @xmath53 .",
    "notice however that , if we choose @xmath69 as we did in the above two schemes , no information on @xmath45 is attainable from the reflection probability @xmath53 , see ( [ reflection_probability ] ) , where @xmath45 disappears from @xmath53 for @xmath69 .",
    "a possible solution to this problem is to flip the orientations @xmath73 in the choice of the reference system @xmath62 in ( [ eq : refsystemf ] ) for the former scheme , while measuring the reflected @xmath3 in @xmath74 direction instead of @xmath38 for the latter . in this way",
    ", the schemes with the reflection probabilities work similarly to the ones with the transmission probabilities , with the same self - consistency condition needed for the tomographic reconstruction of the initial state of the target qubit , @xmath2 .",
    "the reason why these tomographic schemes that make use of the spin degree of freedom of @xmath3 work is the following .",
    "let @xmath75 denote the state with spin parallel ( anti - parallel ) to the orientation @xmath38 of the incident probe spin @xmath3 .",
    "then , the state of @xmath0 is in general expressed as @xmath76 and the spin state of the probe @xmath3 after the transmission by @xmath0 becomes ( apart from the normalization ) @xmath77 a similar expression is available for the reflection case . observe that the component @xmath78 of @xmath2 is associated to @xmath79 in @xmath80 , @xmath81 to @xmath82 , and so on : the spin state @xmath2 is more or less `` transferred '' to @xmath3 after the scattering .",
    "this is due to the heisenberg coupling @xmath54 , which `` swaps '' the states between @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "this is why we can see the spin state of @xmath0 by looking at the spin state of @xmath3 .    until now",
    ", we have shown how the initial state of the target qubit @xmath0 can be reconstructed by sending a probe qubit @xmath3 with a fixed wave numebr @xmath11 .",
    "a natural question would then arise : can we use the spatial degree of freedom of @xmath3 to optimize the above tomographic schemes in the sense that possible errors in the scattering data can least affect the determination of the state ?",
    "it is actually possible .",
    "for instance , one would be able to reduce the effects of possible errors in the observations of the probabilities @xmath55 on the reconstructed vector @xmath45 , by properly tuning the incident wave number @xmath11 .",
    "observe that ( [ v components ] ) and ( [ component of v along n ] ) are linear mappings between the bloch sphere of radius @xmath83 and the probability space , associated to the scattering data @xmath55 .",
    "the reconstructed vector @xmath45 is least sensitive to the errors in the observed probabilities @xmath55 , when the volume of this probability space is maximum .",
    "stated differently , under such a condition , the probabilities @xmath55 are the most sensitive to the bloch vector @xmath45 to be reconstructed , and one can do a better tomography . for the first scheme , in which we tune the detection orientation @xmath39 of the spin of the probe @xmath3 , the volume associated to the probabilities is maximum when the jacobian of the map ( [ v components ] ) , which is given by the determinant @xmath84 is minimum . for the second scheme , in which the incident and detection orientations of the probe spin @xmath3 are the same @xmath69 , the coefficient multiplying the scattering probability @xmath52 in ( [ component of v along",
    "n ] ) , @xmath85 is to be minimized . in fig .",
    "[ fig : first strategy optimization ] , @xmath86^{1/3}$ ] and @xmath87 are plotted as functions of the incident wave number @xmath11 of the probe @xmath3 .",
    "they become minimum at @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively . in particular , observe that , at @xmath90 , the formula for the tomography ( [ component of v along n ] ) is reduced to @xmath91 from which it immediately follows that the probability @xmath52 ranges @xmath92 which is the maximum in this scheme .    ) between the probability space and the bloch sphere , @xmath93 given in ( [ eqn : detm ] ) ( solid ) , and the coefficient @xmath87 ( dashed ) , as functions of the incident wave number @xmath11 of the probe @xmath3 , which are both to be minimized by tuning @xmath11 for the optimizations of the two approaches of strategy i , presented in the text .",
    "@xmath86^{1/3}$ ] is actually plotted instead of @xmath93 , to better compare it with @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath86^{1/3}$ ] is minimum at @xmath94 , while @xmath87 at @xmath89 ( indicated by dots ) . ]",
    "the same analysis can be applied to the schemes with reflection probabilities , for which the optimal momenta are @xmath95 and @xmath89 for the two schemes , respectively .",
    "the _ spatial _ degree of freedom of @xmath3 can itself play a fundamental role for the tomographic reconstruction of the target _ spin _ state @xmath2 .",
    "we fix the incident and detection orientations @xmath96 and @xmath97 of the qubit @xmath3 and tune the wave number @xmath11 to collect sufficient number of scattering data required for the tomography of @xmath2 .     given in ( [ determinant__second strategy ] ) , as a function of @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "only the contours in the range @xmath100 are shown .",
    "@xmath101 takes its minimum value @xmath102 at @xmath103 in the unit @xmath104 ( indicated by a dot).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    let us fix @xmath39 perpendicular to @xmath38 and select three different incident wave numbers @xmath105 .",
    "a collection of the three transmission probabilities with these wave numbers yields @xmath106 where @xmath107 , and @xmath108 are the three components of the vector @xmath45 with respect to the reference frame fixed by @xmath109 .",
    "this relation can not be inverted , since two columns of the matrix are proportional to each other , irrespectively of the choice of @xmath110 .",
    "this is due to the fact that , once the orientations @xmath38 and @xmath39 are fixed , only two components of the vector @xmath45 along the directions specified by @xmath111 and @xmath112 are involved in the transmission probability ( [ transmission_probability ] ) , while it is insensitive to the other component of @xmath45 perpendicular to the plane spanned by these directions .",
    "the same happens if we collect the reflection probabilities ( [ reflection_probability ] ) in a similar way .",
    "this problem however can be overcome by combing the transmission and reflection probabilities .",
    "for instance , @xmath113 which is inverted as @xmath114\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with an inverse matrix @xmath115 , when @xmath116 is nonvanishing and finite .",
    "this condition is fulfilled by @xmath98 and @xmath99 that are both finite and different from zero as well as different from each other . in this way",
    ", we can reconstruct the _ spin",
    "_ state @xmath2 by making use of the _ spatial _ degree of freedom of @xmath3 .",
    "note that only two experimental setups are actually needed to collect the three scattering data : the two probabilities @xmath117 and @xmath118 are obtained at the same time in a single setup , by sending the probe @xmath3 with @xmath98 and seeing whether it is transmitted or reflected with its spin orientated to @xmath39 .",
    "similarly to the first strategy discussed in the previous subsection , the present scheme is optimized by appropriately choosing the two incident wave numbers @xmath98 and @xmath99 of the probe @xmath3 . under the same criterion as the one for the first strategy [ maximizing the volume of the probability space associated by the linear mapping ( [ good_secondstrategy1 ] ) to the bloch sphere of radius @xmath83 , to which the vector @xmath45 belongs ] ,",
    "the optimal choice of @xmath119 is found by minimizing the quantity @xmath101 from ( [ determinant__second strategy ] ) .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : optimal momenta second strategy ] , where the optimal set of wave numbers for the present strategy is found at @xmath103 in the unit @xmath104 .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed the state reconstruction / tomography of a fixed qubit through the scattering data of a probe qubit off the target .",
    "we have presented two different strategies for the tomography , in which the spin and spatial degrees of freedom of the probe qubit play different roles .",
    "the first strategy makes use of the spin degree of freedom of the probe .",
    "the spin state of the target is more or less transferred to the probe spin during the scattering , and therefore , we can infer the spin state of the target through the state tomography of the probe spin .",
    "the other degree of freedom , the momentum of the probe , can be utilized to optimize the tomographic scheme .",
    "the spatial degree of freedom can also play a central role for the state tomography of the target spin . in the second strategy ,",
    "three scattering data required for the state tomography of a target spin are collected by choosing different incident wave numbers and scattering directions ( transmitted or reflected ) , with the incident and detection orientations of the probe spin being fixed .",
    "this tomographic scheme can be optimized also by appropriately tuning the set of the incident wave numbers .",
    "the strategies introduced in this paper for a single fixed qubit can be generalized to the tomography of multiple qubits .",
    "in particular , the detection of entanglement would be an important task in the light of quantum information . in order to reconstruct the state of @xmath120 spins ,",
    "we need @xmath121 different experimental setups .",
    "imagine , for instance , how to choose 15 different sets of orientations of the incident and detection spin states of the probe qubit for the two - qubit tomography .",
    "if the number of the target qubits grows , tuning the probe spin to the different orientations required for the first strategy would become more and more difficult .",
    "in such a case , the second strategy may provide a way out of this problem .",
    "it would be worth exploring such a potential of the scheme , which would be an interesting future subject .",
