    "although the @xmath0cdm model is quite successful on supragalactic scales@xcite , its predictions of galactic properties differ markedly with observation .",
    "there has been an excellent fit to observations over 1 mpc by flat cosmological models with a mixture of baryons , dark matter and the cosmological constant .",
    "however , on smaller scales on the order of galaxy and subgalactic , simulations have failed with the assumption that cold dark matter has weak self - interactions and weak baryonic interactions .",
    "cold dark matter should form triaxial halos with dense cores and other dense halo substructures . yet",
    "it has been found that central regions on galactic scales have nearly spherical low density cores",
    ". also dwarf irregular galaxies have low density cores with shallower profiles than predicted .",
    "high surface brightness galaxies have persistence of bars that imply that galaxies such as our own milky way also have low density cores .",
    "our local group has less than one hundred galaxies while theory and simulations predict about one thousand discrete dark matter halos .",
    "these and other problems led spergel and steinhardt to propose that there was a feedback relation so that dark matter could see itself@xcite .",
    "they proposed cold dark matter that is self - interacting with a large scattering cross section and negligible annihilation or dissipation .",
    "their key proposal was a mean free path in the range of @xmath1 kpc to @xmath1 mpc at the solar radius , where the dark matter density is @xmath2 .",
    "they estimated dark matter in the range @xmath3 mev .",
    "after further analysis they came up with a dark matter particle very much like an ordinary hadron .",
    "although this may solve problems with rotation curves and too numerous sub - clumps in large dark matter halo simulations @xcite , most of the other difficulties remain .",
    "simulations of galaxy formation usually start with a set of hot gravitating point particles with given initial conditions which are then stepped forward in time using huge computer resources .",
    "the jeans mass is thought to be the point at which gravity overcomes pressure and expansion to form galactic structure .",
    "collapse dynamics produces different post collapse densities , circular speeds and disk asymmetries .",
    "since this approach has resulted in many virtually insurmountable problems which have recently been compiled by sellwood and kosowsky @xcite , another approach is necessary for galaxy formation .",
    "in a previous paper @xcite , there was a model of a hot and cold baryon bounce in the big bang . in this paper",
    "is an explanation of how a shell of cold baryonic matter could became galactic black holes and how the hot expanding core was captured by these newly formed black holes . the deeper the gravitational wells , the higher the velocity and mass of hot hydrogen - helium that could be captured .",
    "one of the earliest spiral galaxy correlations involved the tully - fisher relation which originated in 1977 .",
    "@xmath4 where @xmath5 is the characteristic spiral galaxy luminosity and @xmath6 is the circular velocity @xmath7 .",
    "this equation is most accurate in the infra - red range and thus @xmath8 .",
    "mass is proportional to luminosity ( from captured hydrogen and helium).the corresponding relation for elliptical galaxies is the faber - jackson relation . @xmath9 the fundamental plane relations using @xmath10 has increased the accuracy of faber - jackson .",
    "the luminous diameter @xmath11 is defined as the diameter within the galaxy with mean surface brightness and @xmath12 the internal velocity dispersion .",
    "subsequently , ferrarese and meritt found a very tight correlation in both elliptical and spiral galaxies between the galactic supermassive black hole masses @xmath13 and the velocity dispersions of an elliptical galaxy or the spiral bulge velocities @xmath14@xcite .",
    "@xmath15 ferrarese and merritt have found that this correlation is so precise that only measurement errors are contained .",
    "this then is the fundamental relation for galaxy formation and further work in this paper will be based on it .",
    "there are too many close correlations to utilize collapse dynamics at any rate .",
    "a more logical starting place is the supermassive galactic black holes .",
    "hot big bang models , with the history of a scale factor close to a singularity , could not produce such galaxies all with corresponding rotational energies .",
    "outside the immediate area of black hole influence , capturing of matter streaming to the area of influence of each black hole is due to the amount of energy each particle possesses .",
    "large kinetic energies result in hyperbolic or parabolic type orbits with the ability to escape the gravitational well .",
    "lower energies result in stable elliptical or circular orbits .",
    "@xmath16 where e is the total energy , both kinetic and potential .",
    "@xmath17 is the angular momentum , @xmath18 is the central nuclear mass and and @xmath19 is the rotational mass .",
    "the matter that can be captured will have a total kinetic energy less than the potential energy .",
    "matter with more energy than this , such as hyperbolic or parabolic orbits will be considered as having too much energy for capture in a galactic well of this size .",
    "the orbits are differentiated by the following equation from classical mechanics@xcite based on the energy and angular momentum .",
    "@xmath20 if @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the orbit is a hyperbola and the matter contains enough energy to escape the galactic well . if @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the orbit is a parabola and the matter may escape . if @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the orbit is an ellipse and the matter has not the energy to escape the galactic gravity .",
    "circular orbits where @xmath27 and @xmath28 have even less energy . since matter that is surely captured has the potential energy greater than the kinetic , @xmath29 and @xmath25 . expanding the total kinetic energy @xmath30 in the equation for @xmath31 ,",
    "@xmath32 we want @xmath25 and real .",
    "if we let the angular momentum @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the equation for @xmath31 is @xmath35 to simplify this equation , we can use @xmath36 .",
    "the equation for @xmath31 becomes @xmath37 from rotational newtonian physics @xmath38 , then then the galactic well will deepen as @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "the last term in equation 9 becomes @xmath41 .",
    "when this term is dominant , it will allow capturing matter with @xmath42 to increase as the fourth power when the galactic black hole @xmath18 increases . the black hole capturing cross sectional area @xmath43 since both scale as @xmath44 .",
    "to explain why the tully - fisher and ferrarese - merritt equations do not exactly relate the galactic luminosity or nuclear black hole mass to the circular velocity to the fourth power , we note the following . during galaxy formation matter",
    "will be accreted onto the galactic nucleus depending on collisional losses , ionized plasma repulsion and magnetic interference .",
    "any of these factors along with a trajectory directed within ten schwarzschild radii of the nucleus ( as described below ) , will lead to accretion with resultant quasar or active galactic nuclear manifestations .",
    "some decrease in the fourth power of circular velocity will result in tully - fisher equations as well as an increase in ferrarese - merritt as matter is transferred to the black hole .",
    "elliptical galaxies , probably formed by galactic mergers , still can exhibit similar properties .",
    "effective potential for motion in schwarzschild geometry@xcite with a mass @xmath18 , energy in units of rest mass @xmath45 of the particle is @xmath46 and angular momentum is @xmath47 .",
    "the quantity @xmath48 in the next equations is the schwarzschild coordinate .",
    "@xmath49 and therefore @xmath50 stable orbits are possible for @xmath51 .",
    "it should be remembered that the above equations are for nonrotating or slowly rotating black holes . for an unbound orbit ,",
    "the impact parameter @xmath52 is @xmath53 the capturing cross section for a nonrelativistic particle @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the velocity relative to light . for relativistic particles",
    "could cold baryons be the proverbial dark matter ? there is much evidence that this is indeed the case . with entirely hot models of the big bang such as inflation",
    ", no such possibility could be considered . yet",
    "a cold baryonic shell along with hot core baryons at the big bang can explain nucleosynthesis @xcite as well as galaxy formation .",
    "the following galaxy formation problems@xcite are solved by the capture of core and shell baryons by primordial supermassive black holes originating in the shell .",
    "an entirely baryonic model explains why the circular orbital speed from luminous matter , which dominates the inner regions , is so similar to dark matter at larger radii . with many stars in the center areas , initial conditions for dark and luminous matter no longer have to be closely adjusted to produce a flat rotation curve .",
    "a core based blast wave captured by the same size black holes explains why there are similiar circular speeds in all galaxies of a given luminosity no matter how the luminous matter is spaced . the overall mass to light ratio rises with decreasing surface brightness so as to preserve the tully - fisher relation between total luminosity and circular speed . the depth of the gravitational well determines the circular speed and luminosity as noted above .",
    "the hot and cold matter discrepancies are detectable only at accelerations below @xmath57 since they are all baryons .",
    "the halo parameters are related to the luminous mass distribution since all were captured by a given size black hole .",
    "the angular momentum of collapse models are an order of magnitude less than that observed since collapse dynamics were never involved .",
    "the peak phase space density of the halo varies so markedly .",
    "this is the case since baryonic dark matter is not collisionless and not homogeneously distributed .",
    "both shell and core baryons are included .",
    "the predicted circular speed at a given luminosity is high .",
    "this is caused by the capture with the slower velocity matter gaining kinetic energy during a fall into the gravitational well .",
    "it is not directly related to mass to light ratio or halo density .",
    "the number of predicted subclumps in the halos is so much greater than observed as well as predicted clumps compared to satellite galaxies because of capturing rather than collapse dyamics .",
    "the luminosity is related to circular velocity to the fourth power .",
    "the galaxy formation process is so efficient because the black holes acted like vacuum cleaners removing intergalactic and intercluster matter as the universe expanded .",
    "supermassive black holes @xmath58 , the great attractor can be formed from shell fragments .",
    "it takes a different model of the big bang to solve seemingly insurmountable problems of galaxy formation .",
    "evidence for early galaxy formation at @xmath59 in hubble and deep herschel fields has been published@xcite .",
    "this model views the cosmic background radiation as mostly recaptured accretion photons .",
    "the big bang does not having the energy to disturb its planck spectrum .",
    "thus the cbr does not reflect the picture at matter and energy decoupling .",
    "hopefully , a baryon bounce model will be now given a fair consideration ."
