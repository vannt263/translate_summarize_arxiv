    "this paper is concerned with linear galerkin finite element method for singularly perturbed boundary value problems ( bvps ) . consider an one - dimensional bvp problem @xmath1.\\ ] ] for simplicity ,",
    "let @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are constant such that not both @xmath4 and @xmath5 are 0 .",
    "if @xmath6 , by using substitution @xmath7 , it reduces to the case with @xmath8 . if @xmath9 , equation ( [ bvp1 ] ) is said to be a reaction diffusion equation . if @xmath10 , equation ( [ bvp1 ] ) is the so - called convection diffusion equation .",
    "all the results presented in this paper can be readily generalized to smooth and non - vanishing functions of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    if the exact solution @xmath13 of ( [ bvp1 ] ) is `` bad '' in the sense that @xmath14 is not bounded uniformly in @xmath0 , the standard finite element method ( fem ) generates huge errors through the whole domain .",
    "typically , it is caused by a small interval of width @xmath15 ( called boundary layer ) , in which @xmath16 rapidly changes .",
    "to overcome the difficulties in the singular perturbation , it is desirable to put more grid points near the boundary layer or stablize the appoximation methods .",
    "streamline diffusion finite element methods ( sdfem ) , upwinding fem , bakhalov grid , shishkin grid , and many other such schemes are extensively studied in the context of singularly purturbed problems since 1970s , see @xcite . among them , shishkin grid became popular due to its simple structure and high accuracy .",
    "the shishkin mesh was first introduced in finite difference methods and has been discussed in @xcite ; the reader is referred to a survey article @xcite for further details .",
    "a typical shishkin mesh is to construct @xmath17 grid , which is indeed @xmath18 uniform grids in boundary layer plus @xmath18 uniform grids out of boundary layer . by this method",
    ", the approximation provides @xmath0-uniform accuracy .",
    "but they require _ a priori _ estimation in order to determine the thickness of the bounded layer . on the other hand ,",
    "it makes error analysis more complicated , since the errors from boundary layer affect the solution in the entire domain .",
    "therefore , if an approximation can be stabilized and @xmath0-uniform by simply adding one point to original @xmath18 grid , it deserves to be worked out .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on fem solutions of ( [ bvp1 ] ) by starting with an interesting observation . given a grid @xmath19 , we add @xmath20 points arbitrarily in @xmath21 $ ] , denoted by @xmath22",
    ". then fem solutions on @xmath23 and @xmath22 intersect each other at a fixed point in each interval of out of boundary layer , that is , the locations of intersection in each interval is indpendent of @xmath20 and the distribution of added points , see figure [ figcde]-a , figure [ figrde1]-a , and figure [ figgre1 ] .",
    "this directly implies that the accuracy on those intersections are as good as fem solutions on the grid @xmath22 by choosing @xmath24 , denoted by @xmath25 .",
    "provided that the boundary layer is covered by @xmath26 $ ] , the above observation gives the start point of @xmath0-uniform approximation . in lieu of interpolating these intersections , we present a better way to obtain an @xmath0-uniform approximation . by adding one point @xmath27 with @xmath28 or @xmath29 , the interval @xmath30 $ ] block the error impact from boundary layer completely .",
    "the theoretical result shows that the fem solutions with grid @xmath31 in @xmath32 $ ] is the same as the fem solution of @xmath33,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is exact solution at the point of @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is uniformly bounded .",
    "this enables us to use all kinds of standard fem error analysis in @xmath37 $ ] , no matter how huge errors are generated in @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "therefore , the fem errors in @xmath32 $ ] has the accuracy of @xmath39 , which is clearly better than shishkin mesh @xmath40 in both accuracy and computing cost .",
    "another advantage is : one need not know the thickness of boundary layer , since @xmath41 is not necessarily in boundary layer .",
    "the rest of this paper is arranged as follows .",
    "section 2 begins with the model and notation .",
    "section 3 proceeds with the observation on intersections of a family of fem solutions .",
    "section 4 presents an @xmath0-uniform fem , which can isolate the boundary layer .",
    "some auxiliary results are included in section 5 .",
    "section 6 displays some numerical experiment results , including solutions of convection - diffusion equation , reaction - diffusion equation , and green function .",
    "finally , we close this paper with further remarks .",
    "let @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "the weak solution of ( [ bvp1 ] ) is a function @xmath44 , satisfying @xmath45 where @xmath46 is @xmath47 inner product , and @xmath48 .    for a positive integer @xmath49 , let @xmath23 be an arbitrary grid of the form @xmath50 and",
    "let @xmath51 .",

    "unless it s explicitly mentioned , we assume solution @xmath69 of ( [ bvp1 ] ) has a boundary layer at @xmath70 and @xmath71 is located outside the boundary layer .",
    "this is reasonable assumption due to the very short interval of boundary layer depending on @xmath3 .",

    "the result shows that the intersections @xmath92 are independent of @xmath20 and distribution of @xmath78 .",

    "that is , those coordinates of intersections do not depend on the choice of @xmath102 .",
    "analogous to ( [ fem3 ] ) , we have a system of linear equations with respect to @xmath103 , given by @xmath104 @xmath105 and @xmath106 note that for @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , and ( [ isc-1 ] ) leads to @xmath110 on the other hand , for @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and ( [ isc-2 ] ) yields @xmath113 for @xmath111 , @xmath114 , so it follows from ( [ isc-3 ] ) @xmath115 let @xmath116 .",
