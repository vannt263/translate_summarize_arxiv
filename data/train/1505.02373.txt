    "if entropy is not associated with a black hole , then the entropy of the universe will spontaneous reduce whenever an object with a finite entropy crosses the horizon .",
    "thus , entropy has to be associated with a black hole to prevent the violation of the second law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "in fact , black holes have more entropy than any other object of the same volume @xcite .",
    "this prevents the violation of second law of thermodynamics .",
    "this maximum entropy of the black holes is proportional to the area of the horizon @xcite .",
    "thus , if @xmath0 is the entropy associated with a black hole , and @xmath1 is the area of the horizon , then the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be expressed as @xmath2 .",
    "the observation that the entropy scales with the area of the black hole , instead of its volume , has motivated the development of the holographic principle  @xcite . the holographic principle states that the degrees of freedom in a region of space is the same as the degrees of freedom on the boundary surrounding that region of space .",
    "the geometry of black holes will undergo quantum fluctuations .",
    "these quantum corrections will lead to thermal fluctuations .",
    "these thermal fluctuations will in turn generate correction terms for various thermodynamical quantities associated with black holes @xcite .",
    "thus the holographic principle can get modified near planck scale @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that even though the thermodynamics of black holes is expected to get corrected due to thermal fluctuations , we can neglect such correction terms for large black holes .",
    "this is because these thermal fluctuations occur because of quantum fluctuations of the geometry of space - time , and such quantum fluctuations can be neglected for large black holes .",
    "however , as the black holes radiate hawking radiation , they tend to evaporate in course of time .",
    "they the size of the black holes reduces in course of time due to the hawking radiation .",
    "as the black holes become smaller the quantum fluctuation give more dominate contributions to the geometry of space - time .",
    "thus , the thermal fluctuations can not be neglected for small black holes , or for black hole at the last stages of their evaporation .",
    "the correction terms to the entropy of black holes coming from thermal fluctuations have been calculated .",
    "it has been demonstrated that these correction terms are expressed as logarithmic functions of the original thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the corrections to the thermodynamics of black holes has also been calculated using the density of microstates for asymptotically flat black holes @xcite .",
    "this analysis has been done in the framework of non - perturbative quantum general relativity . here",
    "conformal blocks of a well defined conformal field theory is associated with the density of states for a black hole .",
    "this density of states is then used to calculate the relation between the entropy of a black hole and the area of its horizon . the leading order relation between the entropy of a black hole and the area of its horizon",
    "is observed to be the standard bekenstein entropy area relation for the large black holes .",
    "however , this relation between the area and entropy of a black hole gets corrected in this analysis .",
    "the leading order corrections terms to the entropy of the black hole are demonstrated to be logarithmic corrections .",
    "it may be noted that the such corrections terms have also been calculated using the cardy formula @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been demonstrated using this formula that such logarithmic corrections terms will be generated for all black holes whose microscopic degrees of freedom are described by a conformal field theory .",
    "the correction terms to the entropy of a btz black hole have been calculated using such logarithmic exact partition function @xcite .",
    "it has been again observed that these correction terms can be expressed using logarithmic functions .",
    "it has also been possible to obtain logarithmic correction terms for the entropy of a black hole by analyzing matter fields in backgrounds of a black hole @xcite .",
    "the correction terms generated from string theoretical effects can also be expressed using logarithmic functions @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic corrections terms for the entropy of a dilatonic black holes have been calculated @xcite .",
    "finally , the expansion of the partition function has also been used to calculate the corrections terms for the entropy of a black hole @xcite .",
    "such correction terms obtained by using the expansion of the partition function again are logarithmic correction terms .",
    "the correction to the thermodynamics of black holes from generalized uncertainty principle has also been studied @xcite . in this analysis",
    "the thermodynamics of the black holes gets modifies due to the generalization of the usual heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "it has been demonstrated this modified thermodynamics of the black holes predicts the existence of a remnant for black holes . the existence of such remnants for black holes can have important phenomenological consequences @xcite .",
    "as the quantum fluctuations can occur in all black hole geometries , we expect that the thermodynamics of all black objects will get corrected due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "thus , we can use the modified relation between the entropy and area to analyze the corrections for the thermodynamics of any black object . in this paper",
    ", we will analyze such correction terms for the thermodynamics of black saturn .",
    "the black saturn are solutions to einstein equations in higher dimensions .",
    "they are described by a black hole surrounded by a black ring @xcite .",
    "this black ring is in thermodynamical equilibrium with a spherical black hole .",
    "the thermodynamics of black saturn has been studied @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic equilibrium is obtained because of the rotation of the black ring .",
    "it is also possible to construct a black saturn with a static black ring @xcite . in this case",
    ", the the system remains in thermodynamic equilibrium because of an external magnetic field .",
    "it may be noted that conditions for meta - stability of a black saturn have also been studied @xcite . it has been demonstrated that the black saturn is causal stably on the closure of the domain of outer communications @xcite .",
    "the relation between the black saturn and myers - perry black hole have also been analyzed @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that the thermodynamics of a charged dilatonic black saturn has also been studied @xcite .",
    "it is expected that both the black hole and black ring in a black saturn will reduce in size due to the hawking radiation .",
    "thus , at a certain stage quantum fluctuations in the geometry of a black saturn will also become important . to analyze the effect of these quantum fluctuations in the geometry of a black saturn",
    ", we will need to analyze the thermal fluctuations in the thermodynamics of black saturn .",
    "so , we will study the corrections to the thermodynamics of a black saturn by considering thermal fluctuations around the equilibrium .",
    "in this section , we will review the thermodynamics of black saturn .",
    "the metric for black saturn can be written as @xcite @xmath3^{2}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & h_{x}\\left[k^{2}p(d\\rho^{2}+dz^{2})+\\frac{g_{y}}{h_{y}}d\\psi^{2}+\\frac{g_{x}}{h_{x}}d\\varphi^{2}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are constants , and @xmath6 here we have used @xmath7 and @xmath8 the real constant parameters @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) satisfy the following condition , @xmath11 furthermore , we also have @xmath12,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are real constants , and @xmath15 with @xmath16 here @xmath17 is expressed as @xmath18,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 given in the relation ( [ b4 ] ) .",

    "the variable @xmath4 can be written as @xmath28 so , we can see that all parameters can written in terms of @xmath9 with @xmath29 .",
    "the hawking temperatures for the black saturn is obtained by combination of the hawking temperatures for the black hole with the hawking temperatures for the black ring .",
    "this combined hawking temperatures can be expressed as @xcite , @xmath30 where @xmath31 here @xmath32 , while @xmath33 gives a naked singularity .",
    "the entropy of the black saturn , in absence of thermal fluctuations , can also be expressed as @xmath34 this is the entropy of the combination of the black hole and black ring .",
    "the adm mass of black saturn , which can interpreted as enthalpy @xmath35 , is given by @xcite , @xmath36c^{2}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we will use this expression to study enthalpy and therefore @xmath37 diagram .",
    "in this section , we will analyze the corrections to the thermodynamics of a black saturn because of thermal fluctuations .",
    "these thermal fluctuations will become important as the black saturn reduces in size due to the hawking radiation .",
    "we can now write the partition function for this system as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the euclidean action for this system . this partition function",
    "can also be written as @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the inverse of the temperature .",
    "we can write an expression for the density of states as @xmath42 where @xmath43 the quantum fluctuations in the geometry of space - time , will lead to the thermal fluctuations in the thermodynamics of black saturn .",
    "thus , if the @xmath44 is inverse of the corrected temperature , then we can expand it around the equilibrium temperature @xmath45 , @xmath46 neglecting the higher order corrections , we obtain @xmath47 we can write this expression as @xmath48^{-1/2}.\\ ] ] now , we obtain @xmath49^{1/2}.\\ ] ] it may be noted that this second derivative of entropy is actually a fluctuation squared of the energy , so we can write @xcite @xmath50^{1/2 } = c_0 t^2\\ ] ] hence , @xmath51 here , @xmath52 is the original entropy of the combination of the black hole and the black ring given by the equation ( [ t03 ] ) .",
    "thus , the entropy of both black ring and black hole will get corrections to it because of thermal fluctuation .",
    "now , we will introduce a variable @xmath53 to parameterize the effect of thermal fluctuations on the thermodynamics of black saturn .",
    "thus , we will write the expression for the entropy as @xmath54 where @xmath55    we can infer from relation ( [ b14 ] ) that all thermodynamics quantities are depend on @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . therefore , we can calculate thermodynamics quantities in terms of @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
