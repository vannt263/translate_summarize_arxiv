    "recent observations of the disk properties of intermediate mass herbig  ae and late herbig  be stars suggest a close parallel to ttauri stars , revealing the same size range of disks , similar optical surface brightness and similar structure consisting of inner dark disk and a bright ring .",
    "models of magnetically driven accretion and outflows successfully reproduce many observational properties of low - mass pre - main sequence stars , the classical ttauri stars . however , due to the very poor knowledge of the magnetic field strength and magnetic field topology in herbig stars , current theories are not able to present a consistent scenario of how the magnetic fields in herbig  ae / be stars are generated and how these fields interact with the circumstellar environment , consisting of a combination of accretion disk , magnetosphere , and disk - wind region or jets .    as of today ,",
    "only about 20 late herbig  be and herbig  ae stars have been reported to possess large - scale organized magnetic fields ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , using low- and/or high - resolution spectropolarimetric observations . moreover , only for the two herbig  ae stars hd101412 and v380ori @xcite , the magnetic field geometry has been constrained in previous studies .",
    "it is very likely that the rather low detection rate of magnetic fields in herbig  ae stars can be explained by the weakness of these fields and/or by rather large measurement uncertainties .",
    "indeed , in the currently largest high - resolution spectropolarimetric survey of the magnetic field in these stars by @xcite with 132 measurements for 70 herbig stars , the measurement uncertainty is worse than 200 g for 35% of the measurements , and for 32% of the measurements it is between 100 and 200 g , i.e.  only 33% of the measurements showed a measurement accuracy below 100 g .",
    "therefore , any new detection / confirmation of the presence of a magnetic field in a herbig  ae / be star is important to increase the sample of magnetic herbig stars .",
    "clearly , only after we gain knowledge of the magnetic field strength and its topology , can we start to understand how it interacts with the circumstellar environment .",
    "polarimetric observations of the herbig  ae star pds2 ( cd@xmath153@xmath2251 ) were obtained on two different epochs using the harps polarimeter .",
    "this star has been identified as a herbig  ae candidate star in the pico dos dias survey by @xcite .",
    "pds2 displays h@xmath3 in emission , and the pre - main sequence nature is indicated by its _ iras _ colours .",
    "the mass accretion rate was determined by @xcite on eight epochs using different spectral accretion indicators from the near - uv to the near - ir .",
    "this work revealed short - term night - to - night variability , as well as long - term variability on a time scale of tens of days .    using the 0.6 m r.e.m .",
    "telescope on la  silla , a preliminary analysis of pds2 by @xcite showed the presence of @xmath4  scuti - like pulsations with three frequencies on a time scale of 1.01.7h .",
    "the refined analysis of the same data by @xcite revealed pulsations at four frequencies with pulsation periods between 0.9 and 2h .",
    "the relatively low projected rotation velocity , @xmath5kms@xmath6 , and the fundamental parameters , @xmath7k and @xmath8 , were recently determined by @xcite using high - resolution harps spectra . according to their results",
    ", pds2 belongs to the class of herbig  ae stars resembling the chemical composition of @xmath9  boo stars .    due to the relative faintness of pds2 ( @xmath10 ) ,",
    "the presence of a magnetic field was not previously studied using high - resolution polarimetric spectra . in the past , this star was included in two magnetic studies based on low - resolution spectropolarimetric observations obtained with fors1 ( focal reducer low dispersion spectrograph ) mounted at the 8-m kueyen telescope of the vlt .",
    "while in the first study by @xcite no convincing evidence for the presence of a magnetic field in pds2 was found , @xcite reported on the detection of a mean longitudinal magnetic field @xmath11 g .",
    "@xcite disputed this detection after re - examining the fors1 data using their semi - automatic measurement procedure .    in sect .",

    "two spectropolarimetric observations of pds2 were obtained with the harps polarimeter ( harpspol ; @xcite ) attached to eso s 3.6 m telescope ( la  silla , chile ) on the nights of 2012 july 15 and 18 .",
    "these spectra were originally recorded as part of eso programme 187.d-0917(c ) ( pi : alecian ) and were downloaded from the eso archive under request mschoeller 77411 .",
    "each observation was split into eight subexposures with an exposure time of 15min , obtained with different orientations of the quarter - wave retarder plate relative to the beam splitter of the circular polarimeter .",
    "the time to complete the cycle of eight subexposures for each observation accounted for 2h and 4min .",
    "the achieved signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath12 ) in the final stokes  @xmath13 spectra summed over eight subexposures is rather low , accounting for a @xmath14 during the night of 2012 july 15 , and a @xmath15 for the second night on 2012 july 18 .",
    "the spectra have a resolving power of about @xmath16 and cover the spectral range 37806910 , with a small gap between 5259 and 5337 .",
    "the reduction and calibration of these spectra was performed using the harps data reduction software available at the eso headquarter in germany .",
    "the normalisation of the spectra to the continuum level consisted of several steps described in detail by @xcite .",
    "the stokes  @xmath13 and @xmath17 parameters were derived following the ratio method @xcite , and null polarisation spectra were calculated by combining the subexposures in such a way that polarisation cancels out .",
    "these steps ensure that no spurious signals are present in the obtained data ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "usually , before we apply the svd method , we examine the presence of wavelength shifts between right- and left - hand side circularly polarized spectra ( interpreted in terms of a longitudinal magnetic field @xmath19 ) in a sample of clean unblended spectral lines using the moment technique .",
    "this technique allows us not only the estimation of the mean longitudinal magnetic field , but also to prove the presence of crossover effect and of the quadratic magnetic field .",
    "this information is highly important as , depending on the magnetic field geometry , even stars with rather weak longitudinal magnetic fields can exhibit strong crossover effects and kg quadratic fields ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the study of pds2 , for each line in the selected sample of 44 unblended fe  ii lines , the measured shifts between the line profiles in the left- and right - hand circularly polarized harps spectra are used in a linear regression analysis in the @xmath20 versus @xmath21 diagram , following the formalism discussed by @xcite . our measurements @xmath22 g and @xmath23 g achieved on the first and second epochs , respectively , indicated the probable presence of a weak magnetic field on the second epoch .",
    "no crossover or mean quadratic magnetic field at a significance level of 3@xmath24 has been detected on either observing night , probably due to the rather low s / n of the observed spectra .",
