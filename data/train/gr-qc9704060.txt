    "the `` no hair '' conjecture for black holes states , that black holes are completely characterized by their mass @xmath2 , their charge @xmath3 and their angular momentum @xmath4 .",
    "this conjecture presents a generalization of rigorous results obtained for scalar fields coupled to gravity @xcite as well as for einstein - maxwell ( em ) theory @xcite . in em theory",
    ", the unique family of stationary kerr - newman black holes with nontrivial values of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 contains the stationary kerr black holes for @xmath5 , the static reissner - nordstrm black holes for @xmath6 and the static schwarzschild black holes for @xmath7 .",
    "notably , the static black hole solutions in em theory are spherically symmetric , and the stationary black holes are axially symmetric .    in recent years counterexamples to the `` no hair '' conjecture were established in various theories with non - abelian fields , including einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) theory , einstein - yang - mills - dilaton ( eymd ) theory , einstein - yang - mills - higgs ( eymh ) theory , and einstein - skyrme ( es ) theory . apart from some perturbative solutions @xcite , these non - abelian black holes are all static and spherically symmetric .",
    "they are asymptotically flat and possess a regular event horizon . and in particular these black hole solutions possess non - trivial matter fields outside the event horizon .    in su(2 )",
    "eym theory , for instance , there exists in addition to the schwarzschild solution a whole sequence of neutral static spherically symmetric non - abelian black hole solutions , for arbitrary radius @xmath8 of the event horizon @xcite . within this sequence",
    ", the solutions are labelled by the node number @xmath1 of the single gauge field function .",
    "these black hole solutions have regular counterparts , the bartnik - mckinnon solutions @xcite , obtained in the limit @xmath9 .",
    "both , black hole solutions and regular solutions are unstable @xcite .",
    "the situation is analogous in eymd theory @xcite . here",
    "the dilaton coupling constant @xmath10 represents a parameter ; for @xmath11 contact with the low energy effective action of string theory is made , whereas in the limit @xmath12 the dilaton decouples and eym theory is obtained .",
    "in contrast , eymh and es theory allow for stable static spherically symmetric black hole solutions with hair .",
    "here we present strong ( numerical ) evidence , that static black hole solutions in eym and eymd theory need not be spherically symmetric .",
    "indeed , the asymptotically flat black hole solutions we construct possess only axial symmetry .",
    "they are characterized by two integers , the winding number @xmath13 and the node number @xmath1 of the gauge field functions .",
    "constructing their regular counterparts , we have conjectured their existence previously @xcite .",
    "we consider the su(2 ) einstein - yang - mills - dilaton action @xmath14 with @xmath15 @xmath16 $ ] , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the yang - mills and dilaton coupling constants , respectively .    the static axially symmetric anstze for the metric and the matter fields of the black hole solutions agree with those of the corresponding regular solutions @xcite . here",
    "we parametrize the anstze from the beginning in terms of the coordinates @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( instead of @xmath21 , @xmath22 @xcite ) .",
    "the metric then reads in isotropic coordinates @xmath23 with @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 being only functions of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we parametrize the purely magnetic gauge field ( @xmath27 ) by @xcite @xmath28 \\ , \\label{gf1}\\ ] ] with the pauli matrices @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "we refer to @xmath0 as the winding number of the solutions .",
    "again , the four gauge field functions @xmath33 @xcite and the dilaton function @xmath34 depend only on @xmath19 and @xmath20 . for @xmath35 the spherically symmetric ansatz of ref .",
    "@xcite is recovered with @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "denoting the stress - energy tensor of the matter fields by @xmath39 , with this ansatz the energy density @xmath40 becomes @xmath41         + e^{2 \\kappa \\phi } \\frac{f^2}{2 e^2 r^4 m } \\left\\ {   \\frac{1}{m } \\left(r \\partial_r h_2 + \\partial_\\theta h_1\\right)^2    \\right .",

    "the system possesses a residual abelian gauge invariance @xcite . with respect to the transformation @xmath45 the functions @xmath46 and @xmath47 transform inhomogeneously like a 2-dimensional gauge field ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) , whereas @xmath50 transforms like a scalar doublet . to fix the gauge we choose the same gauge condition as previously @xcite @xmath51    with the ansatz ( [ metric])-([gf1 ] ) and the gauge condition ( [ gc1 ] ) we",
    "then obtain the set of eymd field equations @xcite .",
    "we are now looking for static axially symmetric solutions of the field equations , which are asymptotically flat , have a finite mass , and possess a regular event horizon .",
    "the presence of the regular event horizon is the essential new feature of the static axially symmetric black hole solutions with respect to the corresponding regular solutions @xcite .",
    "the event horizon of the static black hole solutions is characterized by @xmath52 .",
    "( in isotropic coordinates @xmath53 is finite at the horizon . )",
    "we now impose that the horizon of the black hole solutions resides at a surface of constant @xmath19 , @xmath54 @xcite . requiring the horizon to be regular , we obtain the following set of boundary conditions for the functions at the horizon ( @xmath54 ) @xmath55 here the gauge field conditions in the first and second line imply @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively . thus the equations of motion yield only three boundary conditions for the four gauge field functions @xmath33 ; one gauge field boundary condition",
    "is left indeterminate . however , for the black hole solutions precisely one free boundary condition at the horizon is necessary to completely fix the gauge .",
    "the reason is , that in contrast to the case of the regular solutions @xcite , the gauge condition ( [ gc1 ] ) still allows for non - trivial gauge transformations for the black hole solutions , which satisfy @xmath58 .",
    "we have implemented various choices of gauge ( e.g.  @xmath59 ) , obtaining the same results for the gauge invariant quantities .",
    "the boundary conditions at infinity and along the @xmath60- and @xmath61-axis are the same as for the regular solutions @xcite ( when expressed in terms of the functions @xmath62 @xcite ) . in terms of the functions",
    "@xmath33 , the boundary condition at infinity ( @xmath63 ) are @xmath64 for the gauge field functions they imply , that the solutions are magnetically neutral .",
    "( any finite value of the dilaton field can always be transformed to zero via @xmath65 , @xmath66 . ) along the @xmath60- and @xmath61-axis @xmath36 .",
    "the derivatives of all other functions with respect to @xmath20 vanish on these axes .",
    "let us change to dimensionless quantities now ; the dimensionless coordinate @xmath67 , the dimensionless dilaton function @xmath68 and the dimensionless dilaton coupling constant @xmath69 ( @xmath70 corresponds to string theory ) .",
    "the mass @xmath2 of the black hole solutions can be obtained directly from the total energy - momentum `` tensor '' @xmath71 of matter and gravitation , @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "the dimensionless mass @xmath73 is then determined by the derivative of the metric function @xmath24 at infinity , @xmath74 as for the regular solutions @xcite .",
    "similarly , the derivative of the dilaton function at infinity determines the dilaton charge @xmath75 .    in order to define a temperature @xmath76 , the surface gravity @xmath77 @xcite , @xmath78 must be constant at the horizon of the black hole solutions .",
    "let us therefore consider the metric functions at the horizon .",
    "expanding the equations in the vicinity of the horizon in powers of @xmath79 , we observe , that the metric functions are quadratic in @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and likewise for @xmath82 .",
    "( axial symmetry requires @xmath83 . )",
    "consequently , we obtain the temperature @xmath84 which indeed is constant @xcite .",
    "subject to the above boundary conditions , we solve the equations for the black hole solutions numerically .",
    "we map spatial infinity to the finite value @xmath85 and employ the radial coordinate @xmath86 .",
    "the equations are then discretized on a non - equidistant grid in @xmath87 and @xmath20 .",
    "typical grids used have sizes @xmath88 , and cover the integration region @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "we employ the same numerical algorithm @xcite as for the regular solutions @xcite .",
    "the numerical error for the functions is estimated to be on the order of @xmath91 .    in table  1",
    "we show the dimensionless mass , temperature and dilaton charge of the axially symmetric black hole solutions of eym theory ( @xmath92 ) and eymd theory ( for @xmath70 ) with winding numbers @xmath93 , node numbers @xmath94 and @xmath95 .    for all solutions the energy density @xmath96 ( [ edens ] ) of the matter fields is angle - dependent at the horizon .",
    "considering small values of @xmath97 the energy density of the black hole solutions tends toward the energy density of the corresponding regular solutions . however , the limit @xmath98 of the energy density is not smooth , because the angular dependence at the horizon remains .",
    "( the limit is neither smooth for the spherical solutions with @xmath35 . )",
    "the reason is , that the magnetic field of the black hole solutions is purely radial at the horizon , @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) , because the boundary conditions ( [ bc3 ] ) require @xmath101 .",
    "in contrast , for the regular solutions the magnetic field also has non - vanishing @xmath102 at the origin , and the contributions from both @xmath103 and @xmath102 precisely add to an angle - independent density at the origin .    in fig .",
    "[ bh1 ] we show the energy density of the black hole solutions with @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath92 and @xmath106 and 1 for several angles .",
    "the figure thus illustrates how , with decreasing horizon , the energy density tends towards the energy density of the corresponding regular solution , which is also shown . for small values of @xmath97 , the energy density of the black hole solutions",
    "has a strong peak on the @xmath60-axis ( away from the horizon ) , just like the energy density of the corresponding regular solutions .",
    "as the value of @xmath97 increases the energy density changes its shape . for larger values of @xmath97",
    "the maximum occurs on the @xmath61-axis at the horizon . with increasing @xmath97",
    "the energy density of the matter fields becomes less important .",
    "therefore the metric functions become more spherical .",
    "this is demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ bh2 ] and [ bh3 ] for the metric functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , for the same parameters . (",
    "@xmath26 looks similar to @xmath25 . ) for fixed @xmath0 and @xmath97 and increasing @xmath1 , the angular dependence of the solutions decreases , whereas for fixed @xmath1 and @xmath97 and increasing @xmath0 , the angular dependence of the solutions increases .",
    "the situation is analogous for finite dilaton coupling constant @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , the angle - dependence of the dilaton function also decreases with increasing @xmath97 for fixed @xmath0 and @xmath1 . for small values of @xmath97",
    "the dilaton function @xmath107 of the black hole solutions looks similar to the dilaton function of the corresponding regular solutions @xcite .",
    "however , it has a small angle - dependence at the horizon .    for fixed @xmath0 and @xmath10 and increasing @xmath1 ,",
    "the regular static axially symmetric solutions form sequences , which tend to `` extremal '' emd solutions @xcite with @xmath0 units of magnetic charge and the same value of @xmath10 @xcite . here",
    "we observe a similar convergence for the black hole solutions for fixed @xmath0 , @xmath10 and @xmath97 and increasing @xmath1 @xcite . for finite values of @xmath10 ,",
    "the sequences of static axially symmetric black hole solutions converge to emd black hole solutions with @xmath0 units of magnetic charge , the same value of @xmath10 and the same @xmath97 . for @xmath92",
    "the limiting solutions are the corresponding reissner - nordstrm solutions .",
    "this convergence is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ bh4 ] for the dilaton function @xmath107 for @xmath108 , @xmath70 and @xmath95 as well as in table  1 for the mass , dilaton charge and temperature .",
    "more details of the solutions will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the black hole solutions constructed here for eym and eymd theory are of a novel type .",
    "they are asymptotically flat , static and possess a regular event horizon @xcite .",
    "however , they are only axially symmetric with angle - dependent fields on the horizon . whereas the energy density of the regular solutions has a torus - like shape , due to a strong peak on the @xmath60-axis away from the origin @xcite , the energy density of the black hole solutions has a similar shape only for small values of @xmath97 . for larger values of @xmath97 the shape of the energy density changes , and a strong peak develops on the @xmath61-axis at the horizon .",
    "the shape of the energy density becomes ellipsoidal and the angle - dependence diminishes .",
    "there is all reason to believe , that these static axially symmetric eymd and eym black hole solutions are unstable .",
    "but we expect analogous solutions in eymh theory @xcite and es theory , corresponding to black holes inside axially symmetric multimonopoles and multiskyrmions , respectively , and for @xmath104 these axially symmetric solutions should be stable @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the stable black hole solutions with higher magnetic charges ( eymh ) or higher baryon numbers ( es ) should not correspond to such axially symmetric solutions with @xmath109 .",
    "instead these stable solutions should have much more complex shapes , exhibiting discrete crystal - like symmetries @xcite .",
    "analogous but unstable black hole solutions of this kind should also exist in eym and eymd theory .",
