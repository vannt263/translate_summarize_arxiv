    "* plant morphology*. in the hydrated state , the spirally arranged stems of _ s. lepidophylla _ are flat and outstretched and , upon dehydration , they compactly curl into a spherical nest - ball shape with an average diameter of 6 to 8 cm ( fig .  [ fig1]a and b and supplementary movie 1 ) .",
    "the exterior stems are typically fragile and have a grey - brown colour . protected within these older outer stems",
    "may be several layers of inner stems forming the centre of the flattened , green rosette of the plant that uncurl and are photosynthetically active upon rehydration in their native state  @xcite .    [ !",

    "s. lepidophylla _ were filmed during hydration and dehydration .",
    "[ fig1]c and d respectively show the curling sequences of outer and inner stems in the course of dehydration from the initial wet condition to the final dry state .",
    "when hydrated , both inner and outer stems were flattened , but when dehydrated , they exhibited large deformation with distinct curling patterns . upon dehydration ,",
    "the outer stems bend into an approximately circular ring in a relatively short period of desiccation , whereas the inner stems curl slowly and form a spiral configuration  ( supplementary movie 2 ) .    [ !",
    "t ]     * morphology and composition of stem sections*. the observation of curling mechanisms of outer and inner stems naturally leads to the question of whether their distinct curling patterns are correlated to the morphology and composition of their underlying tissue .",
    "the stem of _ s. lepidophylla _ is composed of an annular - shaped layer of cortical tissue and an inner , central vascular bundle ( protostele ) , which is separated from the cortical layer by an air - filled canal ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]e ) .",
    "the vascular tissue is comprised of a central bundle of xylem cells that is surrounded by a sheath of phloem cells ( i.e. , an amphicribral bundle )  @xcite .",
    "specialized cells , termed trabeculae , are found within the air - filled canal . due to their thick , cellulosic cell walls ,",
    "trabeculae provide structural support , bridging the airspace between the central vascular bundle and the cortical tissue  @xcite .",
    "the composition of the cell walls was investigated by staining spurr s resin - embedded stem sections ( supplementary information s1 ) with toluidine blue o ( tbo ) for the detection of lignin and pectin under bright field microscopy .",
    "[ fig1]e shows a cross - section of an inner stem at the root - base interface , and it reveals that , while lignified cell walls ( dark blue ) are found throughout the inner cortex tissue , there is an asymmetry in cell density , whereby cells appear to be smaller and/or denser on the abaxial side of the cross section .",
    "further investigation with basic fuchsin staining of paraffin - embedded sections ( supplementary information s2 ) allowed detection of variation of lignified tissues at different sections along the stem length .",
    "consistent with the tbo results , lignification is found throughout the inner cortex in the basal sections  ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]f ) , whereas the middle of the stem shows lignified tissues in the abaxial side of the stem  ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]g ) .",
    "the lignified tissues are reduced to a narrow strip at the apical tip of the stem  ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]h ) . for outer stems",
    ", the staining pattern is similar to that seen at the basal section of inner stems without significant variation along the stem length ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]e and f ; data not shown ) . the spatial variation of lignification along the stem length reduces from the base to the apical tip of inner stems of _ s. lepidophylla _ , and it may play a crucial role in their spiralling curling mechanism .",
    "* curvature characterization of stems . * the variation of the curvature along the length of outer and inner stems ( see fig .  [ fig1]c and d ) was characterized at different time intervals from an analysis of the discrete curvatures  @xcite of the stem centreline  ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a and b and supplementary information s3 ) .",
    "the stems had a small natural twist which we neglect in this analysis .",
    "the curvature and stem length are normalized with the total length @xmath1 respectively as @xmath2 and @xmath3 . starting from an almost straight shape , after one hour of drying , the outer stem started to curl with a progressive curling front which was initially close to the tip before propagating toward the base .",
    "the final dehydrated outer stem resembles an arc with a constant curvature .",
    "a propagating curling front was also observed for the inner stem in the course of dehydration where its apical tip exhibited more mobility and compliance compared to its base .",
    "the maximum achievable curvature of the inner stem increases linearly along the stem length , i.e. @xmath4 representing the geometry of an euler ( cornu ) spiral .",
    "* mechanical response of stems to dehydration*. we investigated the mechanical aspects of the water - controlled curling of outer and inner stems in more detail .",
    "the absolute displacements of the apical tip ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) of the outer and inner stems where tracked during drying  ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]c and d ) .",
    "both the stems experience large deformation .",
    "furthermore , fully hydrated stems were clamped at both ends and the reaction forces that prohibited stem curling were measured  ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]e ) . in a given period of time during dehydration , the weight loss @xmath7 of the wet stems was also determined ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]f ) , a measure that allowed to translate dehydration time into weight loss .",
    "the mechanical response of each stem was strongly dependent on its moisture content .",
    "for the outer stem , a switch - like behaviour was observed . at early times of dehydration ,",
    "the mobility of the stem tip was not notable and the generated axial force in the restrained stem was very small .",
    "once the outer stem reached a certain weight loss level , i.e. @xmath8 , its movement accelerated and its tip moved downward .",
    "at the same water content , a very sharp increase in the force response of the restrained stem was observed . on the other hand ,",
    "the inner stem responded smoothly to dehydration .",
    "initially , the stem remained still until @xmath9 , then a moderately uniform transition was observed in both displacement and restraining force profiles .",
    "the change of the weight associated to the main vertical displacement of the apical tip for the outer stem was @xmath10 , whereas @xmath11 for the inner stem .",
    "the maximum vertical velocity of the tip ( @xmath12 ) of the outer stem ( @xmath13 mm / min ) during dehydration was threefold larger than the one of the inner stem  ( @xmath14 mm / min ) . also , the resultant restraining force during dehydration in the outer stem was about threefold larger than the force in the inner stem .",
    "the outer stem reached its equilibrium weight loss , i.e. @xmath15 , after 1 hour whereas for the inner stem it took about 5 hours to reach equilibrium , i.e. @xmath16 . the drying rate of the outer stem was faster than the inner stem .",
    "a power law behaviour for the early drying rate before reaching the equilibrium was observed with an exponent of 0.65 for the outer stem and 0.41 for the inner one , suggesting a diffusive transport mechanism .",
    "* curling mechanisms of inner and outer stems*. to elucidate the spiralling pattern of inner stems , we adopted a geometrical model based on the normalized euler ( cornu ) spiral , which is defined as a curve with curvature @xmath17 that linearly changes with its curve length @xmath18 i.e. @xmath19 . in this setting , the cartesian coordinates of a normalized euler spiral shape are given by the following fresnel - like integrals : @xmath20 where @xmath21 $ ] is the curve parameter and @xmath22 $ ] represents a desiccation factor , where @xmath23 indicates the initial fully hydrated state and @xmath24 the hydro - actuation strain gradient generated in the stem section upon dehydration .",
    "generalization of the above geometrical model to a hypothetical class of spirals with power - law curvature ( defined by the cesro equation @xmath25 ) allows us to investigate the role of material variation along the stem length ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a and supplementary information s4 ) . the mobility of the stems decrease by increasing the exponent @xmath26 , an outcome that indicates the curling pattern reflects the hydro - actuation capacity of the tissue .",
    "alternatively , stem spiralling can be simulated via finite element ( fe ) modelling of inextensible elastic beams by introducing hydro - actuation strain gradient through the beam cross section  ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b and c ) . the curling of spirally arranged stems of _ s. lepidophylla _ triggered by dehydration has been examined with a simplified fe model of the whole plant  ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]d ) .",
    "the curling of exterior stems with constant curvature allows them to envelope spiralled inner stems in the centre of the plant .",
    "t ]     from structural point of view , the stem of _ s. lepidophylla _ can be seen as a bilayer composed of non - lignified active ( a ) and lignified passive ( p ) layers that curls upon dehydration due to a mismatch in the eigenstrains developed in each layer . in outer stems , the relative thickness of the constituent layers is constant , whereas in inner stems the relative thickness of the active ( passive ) layer increases ( decreases ) from the base to the apical tip of the stem  ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]a and fig .",
    "[ fig1]f - h ) .",
    "the curvature of a bilayer in terms of elastic modulus , geometry and actuation eigenstrains ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) of the constituent layers is given by the timoshenko  @xcite bimetallic model as : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the total thickness of the bilayer with thickness ratio @xmath31 and elastic moduli ratio @xmath32 .",
    "the conformations of several bilayer stems ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) subjected to an actuation contraction strain ( @xmath35 ) where the constituents thickness varies linearly along the stem length are computed by large deformation fe simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]a ) .",
    "in particular , when @xmath36 ratio increases at the base of the stem , a transition from spiral to circular configuration is observed .",
    "in addition , for increasingly higher values of @xmath37 ratio , the number of turns of each stem concepts reduces during deformation .",
    "the curvature of representative bilayer models of an outer stem with constant relative thickness and an inner stem with linear thickness profile is calculated by eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) and fe simulations  ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]b ) . the fe model account for geometric non - linearities that large actuation strains trigger , as fig s3 in the supplemental information further explains , while the timoshenko bimetal model is only accurate for small deformation .",
    "the results compare well with the deformed shape of the stems , and the predicted curvature follows similar trends observed in experiments . from this analysis , we can gather that the proportion of the constituent passive to active tissues along the stem length governs the resulting shape of the stem .    [",
    "stem curling triggered by desiccation is a morphological mechanism in the desert plant _ s. lepidophylla_. this movement has an ecophysiological importance that limits photoinhibitory and thermal damage to the plant and provides a way to overcome bright - light , high - temperature , and water - deficit stresses  @xcite .",
    "we observed distinct large deformation mechanisms ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]c and d ) , mechanical responses ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a - d ) and time scales ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]f ) in moisture responsive curling of outer and inner stems of _ s. lepidophylla _ which may ameliorate their photo - protection function .",
    "our study reveals that two mechanisms are potentially effective  ( see fig .  [ fig3]d ) in moisture responsive curling of the spikemoss _ s. lepidophylla _ :",
    "( i ) stiff outer stems located in the exterior portion of the plant behave as classical bilayers curling with an approximately constant curvature , and ( ii ) compliant inner stems located in the centre of the plant introduce a class of rod - like hygromorphs  @xcite with planar spiralling capacity .",
    "this arrangement , when paired with the plant s spiral phyllotaxy that yields a gradient of stem curling patterns , can adaptively regulate the packing and deployment of the whole plant by according the closure of the plant in dry periods and its opening at times of water retrieval .",
    "one of the main differences between inner and outer stems of _ s. lepidophylla _ lies in their shape transformation mechanisms . in both cases ,",
    "the hydro - responsive movements are mechanical and governed by the properties of the tissues and chemical composition of the cell walls . at",
    "the level studied , the main difference affecting bending in the outer stems appears to be the presence of asymmetric cell density between the abaxial and adaxial sides of the stem . for inner stems , however , microscopic studies also revealed the presence of an asymmetric lignification in the cortical tissue towards the abaxial side of the stem  ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]e ) .",
    "further , in inner stems , the distribution of lignified cells varies along the stem length  ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]f - h ) .",
    "the presence of the lignified cells alters the hydro - actuation capacity of the stem and locally increases the stiffness of the cortical tissue . upon dehydration ,",
    "differential shrinkage strains are induced in the tissue , and are relaxed through conformational changes of the stems ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]c and d ) .",
    "the spatial hydro - actuation strain gradient along the stem length plays an important role in the spiralling pattern of dehydrated stems ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) .",
    "conformations similar to those of the inner stems have been observed in the growth process of coiling tendrils  @xcite . in the balloon vine tendril _",
    "cardiospermum hallachum _",
    ", gelatinous fibres with highly lignified secondary walls generate a contractile force that converts elongated , straight tendrils into a planar spiral shape  @xcite .",
    "the stems of _ s. lepidophylla _ can robustly curl / uncurl over several dehydration / hydration cycles  ( supplementary movie 3 ) without structural damage .",
    "the reversibility of the movement indicates that the shape of the stems mirrors their water content .",
    "the stems respond to dehydration once the water loss exceeds a certain threshold  ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]c and d ) .",
    "this behaviour can be attributed to the existence of free water in liquid form in the interior of the cells and bound water within the fibrous cell walls , a phenomenon also observed in wood cells  @xcite . during dehydration ,",
    "free water molecules can easily leave the cell cavities ( though perhaps more slowly from the cytoplasm if cells are living ) , and despite their significant volume , they appear to only have minor influence on the deformation of the stem ( fig .  [ fig2]c and d ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the bound water molecules are strongly absorbed into the microscopic voids of the fibrous cell walls . during drying desiccation ,",
    "the fibrous cell walls shrink and produce the driving force for deformation , thereby leading to stem curling .",
    "differences in the degree of curling and the rate of water loss can be affected by the lignification status of cell walls , as cellulose can hydrogen - bond water molecules and lignin is hydrophobic .    in summary ,",
    "the spikemoss _",
    "s. lepidophylla _ exploits simple but effective strategies to carefully pack and deploy many of its rod - like stems  ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]d and supplementary movie 1 ) .",
    "the spiral phyllotaxy is organized outward in order of ascending length and increasing lignification along the length of the stems(fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) .",
    "this arrangement , in cooperation with the identified curling mechanisms  ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b and c ) , facilitates tight packing and fast opening of the plant with a minimized interlocking between stems despite their large deformations .",
    "the insight gained from this study might set the stage for the design and development of deployable structures ( e.g. in communication antennas and morphogenetic architectural design concepts ) and actuating devices that can yield programmable shape transformations  ( e.g. stent deployment devices ) in constant feedback and interaction with their functioning environment .",
    "* plant materials*. mature dehydrated _ s. lepidophylla _ were obtained from canadian air plants in new brunswick , canada .",

    "microphylls ( leaves ) were cut off and the stem was secured in a metal clamp which was affixed to the base of a square petri dish .",
    "stems were then allowed to air - dry for approximately 6 hours , during which time changes in their curvature were captured via time - lapse filming at frame rate of 1 min@xmath40 .",
