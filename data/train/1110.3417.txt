    "the realization of tunable inter - atomic interactions via feshbach resonances has made it possible to achieve the crossover from weak coupling bcs superfluidity to bose - einstein condensation bec of bound diatomic molecules .",
    "recent experiments have successfully explored the crossover regime by means of studying the cloud size @xcite , expansion energy @xcite , resonance condensation @xcite and condensed nature of the fermionic atom pairs @xcite . as for the theoretical predictions ,",
    "bcs - bec crossover was first addressed way back in 1969 , in the seminal work of eagles @xcite .",
    "later , using a variational prescription , leggett @xcite showed that as the coupling strength is increased , the superconducting bcs ground state at zero temperature smoothly evolves into a bec state of tightly bound molecules .",
    "nozieres and schmitt - rink @xcite and m. randeria @xcite extended the analysis to a finite temperature . since then , various aspects of the crossover problem has been widely investigated over the years @xcite .",
    "almost all the works have addressed the crossover phenomenon as a two - body scattering problem , where the interaction between two fermions has played the pivotal role . however , as milstein et al . pointed out @xcite it would be interesting to extend the approach to incorporate the effect of higher order interactions in the crossover region .",
    "in fact , higher order scatterings and non linear interactions are being investigated in other domains of ultracold atom physics as well , starting from cubic interactions in bec @xcite , to atom - dimer scattering in fermi systems @xcite and also induced interactions in three - component fermi gases @xcite , and all these studies have brought out interesting new features of the systems .",
    "bcs - bec crossover , too , should not be any exception .",
    "the simplest form of higher order many - body interactions would have been a three - fermion scattering .",
    "it has been argued by holland et al .",
    "@xcite that its effect will not be a prominent one , because in such a three - body interaction , the s - wave state is forbidden .",
    "the only three - body scattering there could come from p waves , which have very little contribution at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "we , too , neglect such interactions for the time being .",
    "instead , we shift our focus to a situation when , along the crossover path , some atom pairs have formed composite molecules , while some other pairs are yet to do so(they are still in the cooper pair state ) .",
    "the newly formed bosons would scatter the pre - formed bosons ( or , cooper pairs ) , which is basically a three - body scattering .",
    "this interaction is sure to be important near the resonance point .",
    "we take a variational mean field approach , and discuss the effect of this additional term for all the four cases when either of the two - body and three - body interaction is attractive or repulsive .",
    "here we start with a two - species fermionic system . in addition to the fermion - fermion interaction ( denoted by @xmath0 ) , and an additional interaction ( @xmath1 ) of the feshbach variety which couples a fermion of type @xmath2 with a @xmath3 fermion to form a bosonic molecule @xmath4 , we also take into account the scattering of pre - formed bosons or cooper pairs by freshly formed bosons , strength of the interaction being given by @xmath5 .",
    "the system is described by the hamiltonian :    @xmath6    + g_3 \\sum b_{q'}^{\\dagger } a_{p'}^{\\dagger}b_{-p'}^{\\dagger}b_{-p}a_pb_q    \\end{split}\\ ] ]    the ground state of the system is consequently given by @xcite a product wavefunction of the bcs ground state , and the ground state for the condensate part of the boson subsystem .",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath8 being the expectation value of the total number of bosons in the condensed state .    from the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) and the ground state wave function ( [ grnd ] ) , the ground state energy of the system would be @xmath9    differentiating @xmath10 with respect to @xmath11 @xmath12 we assume that in the mean field framework , instead of couplings @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath5 , this equation can be written in terms of an effective two - body coupling @xmath13 .",
    "this is in conformity with what mora et al .",
    "@xcite found out for a confined three - body problem : that it can be completely expressed in terms of two - body quantities .",
    "equation ( [ diff ] ) now takes the form -    @xmath14    the exact form of @xmath13 is to be determined later .",
    "drawing an analogy with the standard bcs treatment , we can write @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the gap in the excitation spectrum.@xcite    next , differentiating @xmath10 with respect to @xmath17 , we obtain @xmath18 . or",
    ", @xmath19 putting @xmath15 as mentioned before , @xmath20 using this in equation ( 4 ) , we get    @xmath21    in the bcs limit , @xmath16 goes as @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "therefore , as @xmath23 , @xmath16 goes to zero much faster than @xmath13 ( which is proportional to @xmath24 ) .",
    "hence @xmath25 in this limit .",
    "we therefore have @xmath26    if @xmath0 , i.e , the two - fermion coupling is attractive , then this becomes @xmath27 , a result analogous to the effective coupling in a standard two - species fermionic system , where only the fermion - fermion scattering is taken into account@xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that in the extreme bcs limit , there are almost no composite bosons at all .",
    "therefore , the boson - fermion scattering should not have any effect on the coupling parameter .    on the other hand , in the extreme bec limit",
    ", @xmath16 goes as @xmath28@xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath29 .",
    "equation ( [ geff1 ] ) thus becomes :    @xmath30    this is essentially a polynomial in degree 7 , its real roots being the solutions for effective coupling .",
    "we approximate the effective coupling in bcs side by equation ( [ geff0 ] ) and that of the bec side by equation ( [ geff2 ] ) and study the crossover for various combinations of 2-body coupling @xmath31 and 3-body coupling @xmath32 . at resonance",
    ", it is known that @xmath16 is proportinal to fermi energy only @xcite .",
    "so very near resonance , we treat @xmath16 as a constant .",
    "in the conventional bcs - bec crossover picture , the two - body coupling ( and thus , the scattering length , too ) is positive in the bec side , and it goes to @xmath33 at resonance .",
    "it assumes a negative value in the bcs side , and near resonance , goes to @xmath34 .    in order to study the effects of three - body processes , here we assign some arbitrary values to @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath5 ( all the couplings are scaled by the fermi energy @xmath35 ) , and calculate the effective two - body couplings .",
    "@xmath13 is plotted against the detuning @xmath36 ( which is also scaled by @xmath35 ) to obtain the crossover picture .",
    "we note that even if the values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath5 are changed , the general qualitative trend of the coupling vs. detuning curve remains the same .",
    "+   + * case 1 : two - body interaction attractive , three - body interaction repulsive : *        here we choose @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .the",
    "@xmath13 vs. @xmath36 curve is plotted in figs 1(a ) , 1(b ) and 2 for two different ranges . as shown in figs 1(a ) and 1(b ) ,",
    "when we approach @xmath40 , i.e , the resonance condition from the bec side , we find there are two additional roots in addition to the @xmath41 root . therefore , when we move away slightly from the resonance towards the bec region , there are three roots : one that corresponds to @xmath13 in the absence of any @xmath5 ( and goes to @xmath33 at resonance ) , a negative root that goes almost linearly and reaches @xmath0 at resonance as evident from equation([geff2 ] ) , and a positive root that also varies almost in a linear fashion .",
    "all the three roots survive even when the system is at deeper bec domain .",
    "+        in the bcs side , there is a single root which is identical to the effective coupling of the system in that region when there was no @xmath5 .",
    "it goes to @xmath34 at resonance .",
    "therefore , if starting from the bcs side , one tries to achieve the crossover , right after crossing the @xmath40 point , one encounters three possible paths ( fig.2 )  one coming from @xmath42 , and the other two from finite values of @xmath13 . if the system takes either of the two lower paths , the system actually bypasses the unitarity region ( where the scattering length diverges)in the bec side . in such cases , although a region of unitarity will be present in the bcs side , its bec side counterpart would be absent .",
    "+   + * case 2 : two - body and three - body interactions both attractive : * +         here we choose @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath43 . here also , as shown in figs .",
    "3(a ) , 3(b),4 , we have three real roots in the bec side and a single real root on the bcs side .    in the bec side , therefore , the system has the option to take any of the routes : one of them resembles the case of @xmath44 , and unitarity regions are there at both sides of the resonance .",
    "however , the other two branches can lead to a crossover scenario where again the unitarity is avoided in the bec region .",
    "+   +        we observe from figs .",
    "3(a ) and 4 that that the upper two branches ( including the traditional branch that we have for @xmath45 ) have a region of discontinuity , while the lowermost route is a continuous one . +",
    "* case 3 : two - body and three - body interactions both repulsive : * +         we choose @xmath46 , @xmath38 and @xmath47 . here , as shown in figs 5(a ) and 5(b ) , there are three real roots in the bcs side , and one single root in the bec region .",
    "+ * case 4 : two - body interaction repulsive , three - body interaction attractive : * here we choose @xmath46 , @xmath38 and @xmath48 .        in this case , as seen from fig.6 the crossover picture closely resembles the earlier case , i.e , there are three possible routes in the bcs side , while a single route is available in the bec side . +   +",
    "let @xmath10 be the total energy of the system minus kinetic energy of the fermions .",
    "now , if we compute and compare @xmath10 for all three branches , the branch corresponding to the minimum energy should be the one that the system favours . at resonance",
    "we can treat @xmath16 as constant . using this ,",
    "we plot @xmath10 with @xmath36 and @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "7 ) . in the bec side",
    ", the lowermost branch corresponds to the minimum energy .",
    "now , since this branch is associated with an attractive effective interaction , the bec state should either collapse , or be a metastable one . here",
    "we would get the latter , as the attraction is very weak .",
    "thus , we can have a striking property of the bcs - bec crossover : if we start from a stable bec state , we can achieve the bec domain via feshbach resonance ; but if we start from the bcs side instead , we reach at a metastable bec state . thus the process is not totally reversible .        in the bcs side , as apparent from the figure(9 ) , the branch closer to @xmath49 should be the favoured one .",
    "but in that case , the scattering length does not go to negative infinity , and the system can not achieve the crossover .",
    "this is in contradiction with the well - established theoretical and experimental results @xcite .",
    "so we modify @xmath16 using the form of the gap for weak coupling bcs @xcite : @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the density of states in the fermi level , and @xmath52 is the cutoff frequency for bcs model .",
    "thus we no longer treat the gap as a constant , and incorporate the coupling - dependence in it .",
    "this is justified , since the upper two branches are at the weak coupling domain , so the corresponding @xmath16 should follow the expression for the bcs gap .",
    "now the energy surface takes the form of fig .",
    "10 .",
    "it shows that in the negative @xmath13 side , the energy is less as one goes away from @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , the lowermost branch in the bcs side in figure(10 ) will be the favoured one .",
    "here we have studied the bcs - bec crossover in the presence of an additional three - body interaction term : the scattering of a cooper pair by a newly formed boson near the resonance point .",
    "this has led to alternative crossover routes , and hence , brought out interesting properties of the crossover phenomenon .",
    "most noteworthy of them is the non - reversibility of the process .",
    "if the two - body interaction is attractive ( irrespective of whether the three - body interaction is attractive or repulive),then starting from a stable bec system the bcs state can be reached via feshbach resonance , but the path can not be reversed : a start from the bcs side can only end up in a metastable bec state ( and not the stable one ) .",
    "this , we believe is an important finding and it reconfirms the need of more theoretical and experimental investigations along this line",
    ".    bec - bcs crossover has been experimentally investigated so far in @xmath54li and @xmath55k systems . in most cases @xcite the system",
    "is first prepared in the bec state , and the magnetic field is varied to obtain the bcs .",
    "this is completely in agreement with our results .",
    "in contrast , in the experiment by c.a .",
    "regal et al . , the ultracold k-40 system went through the crossover in the opposite direction , i.e , it was a bcs - bec crossover , and not a bec - bcs one .",
    "whether the final state here is a stable bec or a metastable one with a weak attractive interaction ( as predicted by our calculations ) can be ascertained only after a study of the long - time response of the system . moreover , in this experiment they first lowered the magnetic field slowly @xmath56 to bring it near resonance , and then rapidly changed it @xmath57 to lower it further and obtain the bec .",
    "thus , although the crossover from the bcs to the resonance is an adiabatic one , it is a fast quench which takes the system from resonance to the bec domain .",
    "so the mechanism may not have followed the dynamics of a smooth crossover , and that could have resulted in a different final state ( a stable bec state , for example ) .",
    "an experiment which probes the crossover starting from the bcs side , and changes the magnetic field adiabatically all through , might clarify this point .",
    "the final bec state should also be studied carefully for a longer time so that a distinction between a metastable and a stable state can be easily made .",
    "the author would like to thank her supervisor prof.j.k .",
    "bhattacharjee for his guidance , support and constructive suggestions at various stages of this work .",
