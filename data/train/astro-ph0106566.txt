    "with the announcement by hubble ( 1929a ) of a correlation between his estimates of distances to nearby galaxies and their redshifts , observational cosmology came of age , beginning its long journey into night .",
    "the redshifts used by hubble had been measured by slipher , published by eddington ( 1923 ) , and added to by humason ( 1929 ) in his crucial extension to higher values before hubble s announcement .    however , the announcement of an expanding universe was such an extraordinary claim that proof of its reality by some independent means seemed essential , even though an expanding universe had been predicted by friedmann ( 1922 ) [ cf .",
    "tropp , frenkel & chernin 1993 ] as one of the solutions of fundamental einstein equation of general relativity .",
    "expanding solutions were also detailed later by lemaitre ( 1927 , 1931 ) and robertson ( 1928 ) , each of which , acknowledging friedmann , made advances beyond friedmann by their adumbrations concerning the available observations of galaxies and their relative distances .",
    "it is not clear whether hubble knew of the friedmann ( 1922 ) prediction or of the theoretical , cum observational , papers of lemaitre and robertson in 1927 and 1928 , although robertson told one of us ( as ) that he had discussed with hubble the existence of an expanding solution to the einstein equations before 1929 ( e.g.  sandage 1995 , footnote 16 to chapter 5 ) .",
    "none of these three principal theoreticians are mentioned in hubble s 1929 announcement .    nevertheless , the decade of the 1920 s was not entirely free of observational attempts to test a related cosmological prediction . a year after the publication of einstein s field equations , de sitter ( 1917a ,",
    "b ) had discovered one curious solution to them . although his solution was that of a static metric ( there are only three such solutions ; tolman 1929 ) , it remarkably exhibited a redshift .",
    "the metric coefficient of the four - space time coordinate was a function of distance from the observer .",
    "clocks that are further from the observer s origin in the three - space manifold would appear to tick more slowly than clocks at that origin .",
    "this effect would give an apparent redshift that would vary with distance .",
    "the formal feature of a redshift in the de sitter metric was called `` the de sitter effect . ''",
    "a curious additional feature was that any test particle put into the de sitter manifold would exhibit a radial motion ( eddington 1923 ,  70 ; de sitter 1933 ; tolman 1934 , ",
    "144145 ) even though the spatial metric was static .",
    "the predicted existence of the de sitter redshift effect with its static metric became well known in the decade of the 1920 s .",
    "many attempts were made to find the effect using astronomical data ( distances and velocities ) for objects such as stars and globular clusters , thought then to comprise the wider universe before hubble ( 1925 , 1926 , 1929b ) proved the existence of external galaxies . among the most accessible papers concerning the search for the de sitter effect",
    "are those by silberstein ( 1924 ) , stromberg ( 1925 ) , wirtz ( 1925 ) , lundmark ( 1925 ) , and undoubtedly many others .    with regard to the de sitter effect , it is a continuing curiosity as to what hubble meant in the final sentence of his announcement in 1929 where he wrote :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the outstanding feature is the possibility that the velocity - distance relation may represent the de sitter effect .... in this connection it may be emphasized that the linear relation found in the present discussion is a first approximation _ representing a restricted range in distance _",
    "( emphasis added ) . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    in other words , a larger range in distance may not show a linear relation , he surmised , where he apparently knew that the first order de sitter effect is _ quadratic _ in distance rather than linear ( e.g.  sandage 1995 , eq .  5.10 ) .",
    "cautiously , hubble left open the possibility that the data which he had discussed might define a redshift - distance relation that would actually vary as the square of the distance , which , in first approximation , would appear to be linear for short distances near the origin ( i.e. the first term of a taylor series ) .",
    "hubble also undoubtedly knew of the earlier searches for the de sitter effect by lundmark ( 1925 ) and silberstein ( 1924 ) where they attempted parabolic fits to their adopted data .",
    "however , hubble & humason ( 1931 ) soon proved that the redshift - distance relation was , in fact , linear over the much larger range of redshifts than was available in 1929 .",
    "for this and other reasons , de sitter ( 1933 ) wrote : `` we know now , because of the observed expansion , that the actual universe must correspond to one of the non - static models .... the static models are , so to say , only of academic interest . ''",
    "nevertheless , the concept of an expanding universe seemed so bizarre to many commentators that attempts began already in 1929 to find alternate ways to produce large redshifts other than from a true expansion .",
    "these attempts continue to this day .",
    "the first alternate suggestion was made by zwicky ( 1929 ) where he proposed that photons lose energy on their way to us from a distant source . as a consequence",
    ", they would show a redshift in their energy distribution , both in the continuum radiation and in the fraunhofer lines used to measure the redshifts .",
    "to first order , the redshift effect would be linear with distance because the first term in a taylor expansion of @xmath24 is linear in @xmath25 . here , @xmath26 is the hubble constant and @xmath25 is the distance . with this suggestion , zwicky ( 1929 )",
    "introduced the notion of `` tired light . ''",
    "even as late as mid - twentieth century , zwicky ( 1957 ) maintained that the hypothesis was viable .",
    "however , neither zwicky nor any other subsequent supporter of the proposition ( e.g.  la violette 1986 ; pecker & vigier 1987 ) gave a convincing physical theory for the `` tiredness . '' as critics still point out , any scattering process with energy transfer from the photon beam to the scattering medium , as required for a redshift , must broaden ( deflect ) the beam .",
    "this effect would cause images of distant galaxies to be fuzzier than their local counterparts , which they are not .",
    "perhaps the most interesting attack on the reality of the expansion was the reluctance of hubble himself to believe that the redshifts represent a true expansion rather than `` caused by an unknown law of nature . ''",
    "much has been written about hubble s reluctance , most of which is wrong .",
    "some commentators even suggest philosophical or religious reasons related to a presumed abhorrence of a `` creation '' event that is implied in some interpretations of a real friedmann expansion .    however , the fact is that hubble s reasons were those of a reductionist bench scientist .",
    "he relied ( mistakenly , it turns out ) solely on the interpretation of his observational data and their accuracy , coupled with a mistaken theory of how redshifts should vary with `` distance . '' his equation for `` distance '' has no justification within the modern mattig ( 1958 ) equations .",
    "this story , and why hubble s conclusion would not have been reached using current data analyzed with the modern theoretical equations , is set out in detail elsewhere ( sandage 1998 ) .    in outline ,",
    "hubble s argument was as follows . by the mid 1930 s , hubble ( 1934 ; 1936a ,",
    "b ) had completed his program of galaxy counts , the goal of which was to measure the curvature of space .",
    "he also completed the extension of the hubble diagram of redshift versus apparent magnitude to the limit of the mount wilson 100-inch reflector ( hubble 1936 ; humason 1936 ) .",
    "the data for each of these programs had to be corrected for the effects of redshifts on the apparent magnitudes .",
    "if the expansion was real , hubble assumed that the observed bolometric magnitudes ( or equivalently , the observed magnitudes corrected for the selective part of the @xmath27 term ) must be made brighter by two factors of 2.5 log @xmath15 ; however , if the redshift was due to `` an unknown law of nature '' rather than the expansion , only one such factor was to be applied to the observed magnitudes .",
    "hubble believed that the hubble diagram ( log of the redshift versus apparent magnitude ) must be strictly linear ; in addition , the radius of curvature of space implied by his `` corrected '' magnitudes for his galaxy counts must not be `` too small . ''",
    "consequently , he became convinced that only one factor of 2.5 log @xmath15 should be applied .",
    "if so , the expansion would not be real .",
    "hubble ( 1936b ) wrote :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ if the redshifts are not primarily due to velocity shifts ...

    "the velocity - distance relation deviates from linearity by the exact amount of the postulated recession .",
    "the distribution departs from uniformity by the exact amount of the recession .",
    "the departures are compensated by curvature which is the exact equivalent of the recession . unless the coincidences are evidence of an underlying necessary relation between the various factors , they detract materially from the plausibility of the interpretation .",

    "the tolman ( 1930 ) surface brightness @xmath28 effect was the only known test for the reality of the expansion until wilson ( 1939 ) suggested that the shape of the light curves of type ia supernovae provides a clock .",
    "this supposition was based on the uniform shape of the light curve discovered by baade ( 1938 ) and recalled as history by minkowski ( 1964 ) .",
    "wilson reasoned that such clocks at different redshifts would measure the special relativity time dilation if the light curve shapes of sne ia at high redshifts could be observed .",
    "the stretching of the light curves , increasing with redshift , has now been observed .",
    "the data give a spectacular confirmation of the time dilation effect ( goldhaber et al .",
    "1997 , 2001 ) .",
    "blackbody radiation in an expanding cavity remains planckian in shape but with a decreasing temperature that scales as @xmath29 with redshift ( tolman 1934 , eq .",
    "177.7 ; bahcall & wolf 1968 ) .",
    "the observations of the boltzman temperature of interstellar molecules in the spectra of high - redshift galaxies has now apparently been measured in a difficult experiment with the keck 10-m telescopes ( songaila et al .",
    "an important confirmation of these first results was made in observations by ge et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and srianand , petitjean & ledoux ( 2000 ) .",
    "only upper limits had been achieved before ( cf .",
    "meyer et al.1986 ) which , nevertheless , were highly important in pioneering this test .",
    "although the _ shape _ of an initial blackbody spectrum remains planckian in an expanding cavity , the vertical normalization ( i.e. the photon number ) remains planckian only if that normalization is decreased with redshift by @xmath30 .",
    "this fact is derived trivially from the planck equation as expressed in terms of energy flux per wavelength per unit wavelength interval rather than frequency per unit frequency interval .",
    "( of course , both representations are equivalent by minding the relation between wavelength interval and frequency interval , where @xmath31 . )",
    "hence , because the planck equation defines a _ surface brightness _ , a test of the tolman surface brightness effect is equivalent to measuring the deviation of the photon number per unit surface area in the sky by comparing the observations with the normalization given by the planck equation itself .",
    "the deviation of the data from the planck equation is called the `` chemical potential . '' among other things , the deviation with wavelength could be due to compton scattering in the early universe .",
    "no deviation has been found in the observations to within one part in @xmath32 .",
    "the perfect planckian shape of the relic radiation was measured with cobe to within this limit of @xmath33 ( mather et al .",
    "1990 ; fixsen et al .",
    "the conclusion to be drawn from this spectacular result is that this seemingly perfect normalization of the spectral energy distribution is a definitive proof of the tolman surface brightness factor and , therefore , a definitive proof of the reality of the expansion .",
    "we shall adopt this assumption later in  4 where we combine our surface brightness signal with the theoretical @xmath28 tolman signal and interpret the difference to be due to luminosity evolution in the high - redshift look - back time .      in the first three papers of this series ( sandage & lubin 2001 , hereafter paper i ; lubin & sandage 2001a and 2001b , hereafter papers ii and iii )",
    ", we provide the background and observational data required to carry out the tolman test .",
    "most importantly , we measure the fiducial ( zero - redshift ) relations between the mean surface brightness , absolute magnitude , and linear radius for local early - type galaxies in paper i. in paper iii , we present the observational data on our high - redshift comparison sample of 34 early - type galaxies in the three clusters used in this program , cl 1324 + 3011 at @xmath34 , cl 1604 + 4304 at @xmath1 , and cl 1604 + 4321 at @xmath35 ( oke , postman & lubin 1998 ; postman et al .  1998 , 2001 ; lubin et al .  1998 , 2001 ) .",
    "to compare accurately the local and high - redshift data , the parameters of each galaxy are measured at discrete values of the petrosian ( 1976 ) @xmath36 metric radius , which is defined as the difference in magnitude between the mean surface brightness averaged over the area interior to a particular radius and the surface brightness at that radius ( see  2 of paper i ) .",
    "in the present paper , we use the results presented in papers i  iii to complete the tolman test . in ",
    "2 we review the mattig ( 1958 ) cosmological equations with which to calculate the absolute magnitudes and linear radii of galaxies from their apparent magnitudes and angular radii .",
    "explicit equations for the special case of @xmath37 are given .",
    "we use these equations to obtain the total magnitude @xmath38 , linear radius r , and mean surface brightness @xmath39 as functions of five petrosian @xmath36 radii of 1.0 , 1.3 , 1.5 , 1.7 , and 2.0 mag for the 34 high - redshift early - type galaxies .",

    "these values are derived from the observational data listed in paper iii .",

    "we show the sensitivity of the observed tolman signal to the assumed value of @xmath11 used in the data of tables 24 .",

    "in  7 , we discuss the systematic uncertainties in the tolman test made here and describe plans to strengthen the present test .",
    "comparison of the high - redshift data in paper iii with the data for local galaxies in paper i requires knowledge of absolute magnitudes ( corrected for @xmath27 term ) and linear radii .",
    "we have two options to calculate these values .",
    "( 1 ) if we were to assume that the standard model that leads to the mattig ( 1958 , 1959 ) equations ( which assume that the expansion is real ) did not exist , the natural assumption is that the distance , @xmath42 , at the time that light is received is related to redshift by @xmath43 .",
    "this was hubble s assumption throughout his work , including the last summary paper in his darwin lecture ( hubble 1953 ) .",
    "( 2 ) alternately , we can adopt the details of the standard model by choosing a value for the deceleration parameter , @xmath12 ( hoyle & sandage 1956 ) .",
    "we then use the mattig ( 1958 ) equations to calculate the distance modulii , @xmath44 , and the linear radii , r , from the observed angular radii . here as the distance parameter by replacing @xmath45 by @xmath25 , where , in the standard notation , @xmath8 is the scale factor that varies with time and @xmath46 is the dimensionless co - moving radial coordinate in the metric . hence , in our notation here , @xmath42 is the distance at the time light is received from a galaxy at redshift @xmath47 .",

    "the envelope lines plotted in this figure are the same as in figure 3 ; however , they have been converted to the @xmath10 band by @xmath66 ( see above ) .",
    "two features of figures 3 and 4 are noted .",
    "( 1 ) the scatter is larger than in the @xmath22 , log r plane ( figures 12 ) .",
    "( 2 ) although the mean @xmath22 in both diagrams is depressed relative to the zero - redshift calibration lines , the amount is less in the @xmath22 , @xmath38 plane than in the @xmath22 , log r plane .",
    "the first effect on the larger scatter in figures 34 is due to the larger scatter in the @xmath22 , @xmath38 plane even for zero redshift ( see figure 3 of paper i ) .",
    "the obvious reason is that errors in @xmath38 and/or @xmath22 move points _ perpendicular _ to the slope of the correlation line .",
    "by contrast , the error vectors in the @xmath22 , log r plane in figures 1 and 2 are nearly parallel to the correlation lines .",
    "the second effect is due to the double degeneracy to luminosity evolution in the @xmath22 , @xmath38 plane .",
    "as said before , luminosity evolution affects both coordinates .",
    "relative to the zero - redshift line , an increase in the luminosity at high redshift due to luminosity evolution moves a point brighter in @xmath38 and also brighter in @xmath22 relative to that line .",
    "therefore , in an observed @xmath22 , @xmath38 diagram that contains luminosity evolution , the depression from the zero - redshift line is diluted twice , once in @xmath22 and once in @xmath38 .    because figures 12 are more powerful than figures 34 for this reason of double degeneracy , we have made the calculations of the signal , as represented by @xmath3 , and the luminosity evolution , as represented by @xmath104 , only from the @xmath22 , log r data in figures 12",
    "of course , the final answers from the analysis in either representation must be the same because the @xmath68 versus log r and the @xmath22 versus @xmath38 diagrams are simply different representations of the same data , connected by equation ( 11 ) of paper i.      use of the mattig ( 1958 ) equations for linear radius and absolute magnitude guarantees that the combination of @xmath22 , @xmath38 , and the linear radius , r , are consistent with the variation of @xmath22 with redshift as @xmath105 mag . because the log r and @xmath38 values in tables 24 are calculated using the mattig ( 1958 ) equations ,",
    "the deviations of the `` observed '' @xmath38 , calculated with the mattig equation , must be precisely @xmath106 . hence , the observed deviations from the zero - redshift lines prove nothing except to show how much the absolute magnitude , @xmath38 , must change in the look - back time to conform with the @xmath107 relation .    in figures 5 and 6",
    ", we plot the relation between log r and @xmath38 for the @xmath8 band and @xmath10 band , respectively .",
    "the envelope lines are calculated from the zero - redshift relations using the linear equations from table 2 , the non - linear corrections for small r from table 3 , and equation ( 11 ) given in paper i. these figures do nothing more than demonstrate that @xmath38 _ must _ become brighter with increasing redshift ( due to evolution ) in order to make the true depression of @xmath68 in figures 1 and 2 , corrected for evolution , equal to @xmath30 if the standard model is correct . from equation ( 8) , we see that the requirements for a precise agreement with the tolman prediction is that the mean magnitude deviation at constant log r must be @xmath108 mag in the @xmath10 band for cl 1324 + 3011 ( @xmath59 ) , @xmath109 mag in the @xmath10 band for cl 1604 + 4304 ( @xmath60 ) , and @xmath110 mag in the @xmath8 band cl 1604 + 4321 ( @xmath58 ) if the tolman signal , freed from luminosity evolution , would be precisely @xmath30 . calculating the average difference at constant log r between the high - redshift data and the zero - redshift relations plotted in figures 5 and 6 , we measure precisely , by definition , these values .",
    "the predictions for luminosity evolution from spectral synthesis models with varying star formation histories are made in the next section to compare with these predictions from the tolman test .",
    "an early order - of - magnitude estimate of the expected change of the luminosities of early - type galaxies in the look - back time was based on the change of the turnoff luminosity in the hr diagram for an old , coeval population where no new stars are formed after the initial starburst .",
    "the method is interesting because of its simplicity .",
    "it led early on to the result that the passive luminosity evolution correction was close to @xmath111 .",
    "this result is given by the simplistic calculation of direct main sequence burn - down , including corrections for the main sequence luminosity function ( sandage 1961b , 1988 ) .",
    "in addition , the elaborate population synthesis models by tinsley ( 1968 , 1972a , b , 1976 , 1977 , 1980 and references therein ) gave nearly the same result .",
    "we show in the next section that nearly the same result is also given by fitting the observed spectral energy distribution and the size of the 4000  break with the star formation models of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) .",
    "the look - back times vary , of course , with the assumed value of @xmath12 .",
    "the calculated ages for galaxies with the observed redshifts of the three clusters must agree with the ages from the bruzual & charlot models , at least approximately , if our story is to have coherence . anticipating the next section",
    ", we set out here the `` cosmological ages '' based on the redshift , the look - back time , and the assumed values of the hubble constant @xmath100 and @xmath12 .",

    "the ages , @xmath112 , at a given redshift are given by    @xmath113    for @xmath11 and    @xmath114    for @xmath13 .",
    "the case for @xmath115 is more complicated and can be found from the tables in sandage ( 1961b ) .",
    "equation ( 9 ) gives ages of 4.82 gyr , 4.30 gyr , and 4.21 gyr at the time light left the three clusters with redshifts of 0.7565 , 0.8967 , and 0.9243 , respectively , for @xmath11 and @xmath116 km s@xmath41 mpc@xmath41 .",
    "for these calculations , we must use the real value of @xmath100 ( sandage & tammann 1997 ; theureau et al .",

    ".    equation ( 10 ) gives the ages at the time light left of 9.60 gyr , 8.89 gyr , and 8.76 gyr , respectively , for the same clusters using @xmath117 .",
    "the extreme case of @xmath118 , where the age of the universe is only @xmath119 gyr for @xmath116 , gives ages when light left the three clusters of 3.77 gyr , 3.32 gyr , and 3.26 gyr , respectively , using table 3 of sandage ( 1961b ) .",
    "it is also interesting to calculate the absolute magnitudes of the main sequence termination ( @xmath120 ) for these ages .",
    "the modern oxygen enhanced evolutionary models by bergbush & vandenberg ( 1992 ) for [ fe / h ] = 0 give bolometric magnitudes of    @xmath121    as interpolated from their tables ( sandage 1993 ) .",
    "hence , the main sequence absolute bolometric magnitudes for the @xmath37 look - back times for the three clusters are 3.18 , 3.06 and 3.03 mag , respectively . the brightest turn off magnitudes are , of course , for the @xmath118 models because the ages when light left are the smallest .",
    "these bolometric turnoff magnitudes for the @xmath118 case are 2.91 , 2.79 , and 2.73 mag , respectively .      to calculate the expected amount of luminosity brightening with look - back time , we have chosen to use the stellar population synthesis code of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) because , as part of the original photometric and spectral analyses of these clusters , postman , lubin & oke ( 1998 , 2001 ; hereafter plo98 and plo01 ) use the 1996 stellar evolution models of bruzual & charlot ( hereafter bc96 ) to study the star - formation histories and ages of the cluster galaxies .",
    "the authors find that the bruzual & charlot models are ideal because they can be used to generate absolute energy distributions over a broad wavelength range , with a spectral resolution which is comparable to the observed keck spectra ( see oke , postman & lubin 1998 ; plo98 ; plo01 ) .",
    "the free parameters in the bc96 models include the mass function , the metal abundance , and the star - formation rate .",
    "following plo98 and plo01 , we have chosen models with a salpeter mass function ( salpeter 1955 ) and a maximum stellar mass of @xmath122 .",
    "comparisons with models constructed with a scalo luminosity function ( scalo 1986 ) show no significant difference at the level of accuracy that can be achieved with low - resolution keck spectra ( plo98 ) .",
    "based on the metal - line equivalent widths and balmer jump strengths , plo01 determine that models with assumed metallicities between @xmath123 ( 0.2 solar ) and @xmath124 ( solar ) provide reasonable fits to the data . because the metallicities of the cluster galaxies are not strongly constrained , we assume a solar abundance for our calculations .    the most significant constraint on the bc96 models is the choice of the star formation history .",
    "the simplest model assumes that there is a large , initial burst of star formation after which the galaxy fades in accordance with passive stellar evolution models .",
    "these model are called `` ssp '' models by bruzual & charlot .",
    "the next simplest models are those where star formation begins at @xmath125 and decreases exponentially with a fixed time constant .",
    "plo98 and plo01 refer to these models as tau ( @xmath126 ) models and have considered time constants ranging from 0.2 to 20 gyr .",
    "any of these models can be used to generate the expected broad - band ( @xmath127 ) ab magnitudes once the galaxy redshift is specified ( see e.g.  figure 7 of paper iii ) .    in order to characterize the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of each galaxy , plo01",
    "have used the slope , referred to as @xmath128 , of a linear least - squares fit to the measured ab magnitudes as a function of log @xmath129 ( see  2.1 of plo01 ) .",
    "the slope @xmath128 provides a more robust indicator of the overall broad - band sed than any individual color measure , although @xmath128 is strongly correlated with the usual broad - band colors [ e.g.  @xmath130 .",
    "the early - type galaxies used in the present experiment are the reddest galaxies in the clusters and , therefore , have the largest values of slope @xmath128 with @xmath131 ( see tables 24 of plo01 ) .",
    "the best - fit bc96 models to these galaxies are either the ssp model ( which is essentially equivalent to a @xmath132 gyr model ) or a tau model with @xmath133 gyr ( see figure 6 of plo01 ) .",
    "therefore , we have chosen these models to measure the range in luminosity evolution that we expect between @xmath134 and the cluster redshifts of @xmath135 , respectively .",
    "for these calculations , we use the ages for each cluster derived in  4.1 for different values of @xmath12 and assume that the epoch of star formation occurred at @xmath136 .",
    "this high formation epoch is consistent with other observations of cluster early - type galaxies ( e.g.  aragn - salamanca et al .",

    "1999 ) .    using these models to measure the luminosity brightening with look - back time , we find , as expected , that the smallest luminosity evolution is measured with the ssp model because the burst of star formation is the shortest of the models that we are considering ; conversely , the largest luminosity evolution is measured with the @xmath137 gyr model because of its extended burst of star formation . for a @xmath132 gyr model with @xmath11 , we find that the theoretical luminosity evolution would be @xmath138 mag for cl 1324 + 3011 at @xmath59 , @xmath139 mag for cl 1604 + 4304 at @xmath60 , and @xmath140 mag for cl 1604 + 4321 at @xmath58",

    "the results of the theoretical calculations agree well with other measures of luminosity evolution for early - type galaxies at @xmath149 .",
    "depending on the particular passband and cosmological parameters , the absolute luminosities of field and cluster early - type galaxies are brighter by approximately @xmath150 mag at redshifts of @xmath151 ( e.g.  i m et al .",

    "clearly , the amount of evolution that we require to make @xmath152 ( see equation 8) is fully consistent , within the errors , with the range of theoretical expectations determined above .",
    "therefore , we assert that we have either ( 1 ) detected the evolutionary brightening directly from the @xmath22 observations on the assumption that the tolman effect exists , or ( 2 ) confirmed that the tolman test for the reality of the expansion is positive provided that the theoretical luminosity correction for evolution is real .",

    "later , pahre et al .  ( 1996 ) used the kormendy relation between effective radius and mean surface brightness to compare elliptical galaxies in the coma cluster to those in abell 2390 ( @xmath154 ) and abell 851 ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "both studies found that the data were fully consistent with the universal expansion assuming simple models of passive evolution of elliptical galaxies .",
    "we need now to estimate the sensitivity of the results in  3 to the value of @xmath12 .",
    "the sensitivity arises from the differences in the values of the linear radii calculated from the angular radii and the redshift for different values of @xmath12 .",
    "different linear radii entered into the log r , @xmath22 diagnostic diagrams of figures 1 and 2 will give different displacements from the zero - redshift local envelope lines and , therefore , a different tolman signal .",
    "we can estimate these differences by calculating the change in the linear radii made by changing the value of @xmath12 and calculating the effect on the tolman signal using the zero - redshift envelope lines for different @xmath36 values from tables 2 and 3 of paper i.    the mattig ( 1958 ) equations for linear radius r @xmath156 and absolute magnitude @xmath38 are summarized elsewhere ( sandage 1988 ; 1995 , eqs .",
    "3.9 & 4.5 ) for any @xmath12 and arbitrarily large @xmath47 values .",
    "they will not be repeated here .",
    "table 8 shows the result of using these equations to calculate the necessary parameters for the @xmath117 and @xmath14 models .",
    "the distance moduli listed in columns 3 and 7 are for @xmath40 . the log @xmath57 values to convert log ( angular radii ) to log ( linear radii )",
    "are given in columns 4 and 8 via equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) of  2.1 .",
    "the differences in absolute magnitude and log r relative to the @xmath37 case are listed in columns 56 and 910 for the @xmath117 and the @xmath118 cases , respectively .",
    "the magnitude and log r differences relative to the @xmath11 case can be used to convert the @xmath38 , log r data in tables 24 to the other @xmath12 cosmologies .",
    "calculation of the changes in the tolman signal for different @xmath12 values is made by multiplying the change in log r from columns 6 and 10 of table 8 by the slopes in table 2 of paper i. these slopes vary between 3.0 and 3.5 depending on the @xmath36 value . for our most reliable values of @xmath5 and 2.0 ,",
    "the average slope is 3.1 . multiplying the @xmath157 log r values by 3.1 shows that the tolman signal will be made smaller for the @xmath13 case relative to that for @xmath11 .",
    "that is , there will be a smaller deviation from the local line .",
    "the required evolutionary correction is made larger by 0.18 mag for cl 1324 + 3011 at @xmath59 , 0.23 mag for cl 1604 + 4304 at @xmath60 , and 0.22 mag for cl 1604 + 4321 at @xmath158 .",
    "this difference translates into changing the exponent for the tolman signal and the evolutionary corrections in equations ( 7 ) and ( 8) for the @xmath11 case to @xmath159 and @xmath160 for the @xmath8 band and @xmath161 and @xmath162 for the @xmath10 band .",
    "the opposite sense is required for the @xmath118 case because table 8 shows that the log r values are smaller than for the @xmath37 case by @xmath163 dex for @xmath135 , respectively .",
    "using smaller log r values in figures 1 and 2 gives a larger tolman signal ( in magnitudes ) by 3.1 times the differences in log r which are listed in table 8 .",
    "consequently , the measured luminosity evolution is smaller by 0.11 mag for cl 1324 + 3011 at @xmath59 , 0.12 mag for cl 1604 + 4304 at @xmath60 , and 0.15 mag for cl 1604 + 4321 at @xmath58 .",
    "these changes correspond to a final tolman signal of @xmath164 and @xmath165 in the @xmath8 and @xmath10 band , respectively .",
    "the corresponding evolutionary requirement is , of course , @xmath166 and @xmath167 for the @xmath8 and @xmath10 band , respectively .",
    "the conclusion is that the tolman test as performed here is sensitive to the value of @xmath12 at the less than 23% level .",
    "as argued in paper i , it is not so severe as to make the test degenerate .",
    "our result is that a tolman signal exists , as modified by evolution , at the level of @xmath4 with @xmath3 lying between @xmath168 in the @xmath8 band and between @xmath169 in the @xmath10 band , depending on @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the correction for luminosity evolution is @xmath170 where @xmath142 lies between @xmath171 in the @xmath8 band and between @xmath172 in the @xmath10 band , again depending on @xmath12 .",
    "the required evolutionary correction to make the real tolman signal equal to @xmath28 is well within the errors of the requirements of bruzual & charlot spectral synthesis models , i.e.  approximately 2.5 log @xmath170 where @xmath173 to 2.4 in the @xmath8 band and @xmath174 to 2.1 in the @xmath10 band , as @xmath12 changes from @xmath175 to @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the tolman prediction is verified and that the expansion is real .",
    "we note that recent studies of high - redshift type ia supernovae , the cosmic microwave background , and the statistics of gravitational lenses suggest that the universe is flat with a non - zero cosmological constant , @xmath176 ( see e.g.  kochanek 1996 ; helbig et al .",
    "1999 ; de bernadis et al .",
    "2000 ; pryke et al .",
    "2001 ; riess et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) . currently , the preferred world model is @xmath177 and @xmath178 . in this cosmology ,",
    "the log r values are almost identical to the empty - universe ( @xmath13 ) case ; they are larger by only 0.01 dex or less at the redshifts of our three clusters .",
    "in addition , all flat - universe models with @xmath179 give log r values which lie within the range that we have calculated for the @xmath180 cosmologies ( see table 8) .",
    "consequently , our conclusions about the universal expansion are still robust for these @xmath176 cosmologies .    in the next section , we show that the predictions of the `` tired light '' speculation is not verified at the definitive level of better than 10 @xmath23 .",
    "in contrast with the standard model with the mattig equations , there is no metric theory of how distances and magnitudes are measured in a `` tired light '' model .",
    "therefore , we must guess at a reasonable equation for distance .",
    "we adopt a discussion that is given elsewhere ( sandage 1995 ,  4.3 ) and use an equation for `` coordinate '' distance in a flat space which is    @xmath181    because the universe is not expanding in the model , the distance `` now '' in equation ( 12 ) is also the distance when light left .",
    "this , of course , is the crucial point . in the expanding case",
    ", the distance at the present epoch must be divided by @xmath15 to give the distance when light was emitted .",
    "it is this latter distance in the expanding case that , when multiplied by the angular radius , fixes the linear radius .    with @xmath40 , the linear radius that corresponds to an observed angular radius ( in arcsec ) in the `` tired light '' case",
    "is    @xmath182 + { \\rm log}~\\theta\",\\ ] ]    using equation ( 12 ) .",
    "hence , the @xmath57 term , as defined in equation ( 5 ) , becomes    @xmath183.\\ ] ]    the log @xmath57 values calculated in this way are listed in column 12 of table 8 for the three high - redshift clusters .",
    "these values , compared with the log @xmath57 values for the @xmath11 case , give the increase in the log r values that must be entered in the @xmath68 , log r diagnostic diagram .",
    "for example , for cl 1324 + 3011 ( @xmath184 ) the log r values must be made larger by 0.305 dex relative to the @xmath11 values listed in table 3 .",
    "the magnitudes must also be changed because the distance moduli are different than those in the fiducial @xmath11 case . the absolute magnitude calculation for the tired light model follows from the expected theoretical relation that    @xmath185    where only one power of @xmath186 for the `` energy effect '' is required , rather than two powers of @xmath186 in the roberston ( 1938 ) equation in the standard theory ( cf .",
    "sandage 1995 , eq .",
    "hence ,    @xmath187 + 43.89,\\ ] ]    for @xmath40 .",
    "it is can be shown from equation ( 16 ) that the magnitude ",
    "redshift relation for `` tired light '' is the same to within a few hundredths of a magnitude with the case for @xmath118 using the mattig equation .",
    "this is true even for redshifts as large as @xmath188 .",
    "column 13 of table 8 confirms this statement , seen by the fact that the entries in column 9 for the @xmath118 case are very close to those in column 13 for `` tired light . ''",
    "however , these magnitude changes are academic here in using the @xmath22 , log r diagnostic diagram because no corrections for the magnitude differences need to be applied to the @xmath22 values .",
    "these are _ observed _ @xmath22 values ( only corrected for @xmath27 dimming ) ; hence , as emphasized before , they are independent of all cosmologies .    with the changes to tables 24 for log r that are listed in column 14 of table 8 , we can enter figures 1 and 2 for the `` tired light '' case in order to measure the depression from the local upper envelope calibration .",
    "the result , not shown but which the reader can recover using the @xmath157 log r values given in table 8 together with tables 24 , is that a measurable @xmath22 depression at these larger log r values is again present .",
    "it is , of course , smaller than for the expanding case because of the larger log r values .",
    "but , by how much ? the crucial question is whether it is so much smaller as to conform to a depression of only 2.5 log @xmath15 mag when the correction for luminosity evolution is also applied .",
    "we have analyzed the data for the three clusters in the same way as in  3 ; however , we now use the correct log r values required by the `` tired light '' conjecture , using the recipes in table 8 . expressing the result of the @xmath22 depression from the zero - redshift fiducial line in the @xmath22 , log r diagram as the exponent , @xmath3 , in 2.5 log @xmath4 gives the weighted mean of @xmath189 for the @xmath8 band and @xmath190 for the @xmath10 band .",
    "as described in  3 , we have used the results from the most reliable @xmath36 values of @xmath5 and @xmath78 .",
    "the resulting exponents are _ too large _ by approximately 5 and 10 @xmath23 , respectively , compared to the @xmath191 prediction of the `` tired light '' scenario . consequently , to produce coherence with the `` tired light '' model , we require negative luminosity evolution in the look - back time , i.e.  _ galaxies must be fainter in the past_. no feasible model of stellar evolution can produce such luminosity evolution with time .    in fact , just as in the expanding case , positive luminosity evolution must have occurred in the look - back time because there is no way in the tired light model to prevent the stellar content of galaxies from evolving during the look - back time .    a static model where the redshift is not due to expansion is not the same as a steady state model where the mean parameters of galaxies , averaged over an ensemble of galaxies , are required to be the same at all distances and at all times . for a steady state to exist , despite the evolution of the stellar content of individual galaxies ,",
    "requires that there must be young and old galaxies in every volume of space and at every cosmic time such that the mean age is the same at all distances and times .",
    "this requires continuous galaxy formation at the same rate at all cosmic times in order to maintain a constant mean age everywhere , always",
    ".    however , such steady state models are not the same as static models where the redshift is due to an unknown physical cause , either at the source or in the intervening light path from the source to the observer as originally postulated by zwicky ( 1929 ) .",
    "in fact , the steady state models proposed by bondi , gold , and hoyle are truly expanding models where the redshift is due to the expansion .",
    "they are not static models .",
    "furthermore , a early proof that steady state models can not be correct was the demonstration of the failure of the predicted steady state color distribution , with its required mixture of ages , to match the observed color distribution of early - type galaxies ( sandage 1973 ) .    hence , as in the present paper , evolutionary corrections to magnitudes must be applied to both the expanding and the static models in making the present test",
    "the supposed degeneracy of the tolman test due to the identity claimed by moles et al .",
    "( 1998 ) of the surface brightness effect in both the expanding and a static ( tired light ) case is not correct .",
    "their error is due to a category mistake by confusing static and steady - state models .",
    "what moles et al",
    ".  have done is to combine a static model with a steady state model .",
    "this is a higher order departure from the standard expanding model than we have considered here and is not the test we have made . in any case , as stated above , a steady state model can again be disproved by the color argument ( sandage 1973 ) . hence , even the higher order model proposed by moles et al",
    ".  can not be correct on this ground alone .",
    "the result of the present paper is that a static model , where the redshift is due to an unknown physical cause , fails the surface brightness test by a large factor .",
    "such a model requires luminosity evolution in the look - back time , just as in the expanding case .",
    "based on the analysis in  4 , we find that a good approximation for the amount of increase in luminosity at the epoch of light emission is 2.5 log @xmath170 mag , where @xmath192 . applying this correction to the `` tired light ''",
    "analysis gives the intrinsic `` tired light '' prediction for the corrected exponents of @xmath193 and @xmath194 for the @xmath8 and @xmath10 bands , respectively .",
    "each value is more than 10 @xmath23 from the required exponent of 1.0 if the `` tired light '' scenerio were correct .",
    "we take this to be a definitive proof that the hypothesis of non - expansion does not fit the surface brightness data .",
    "there are two systematic uncertainties in the present experiment .",
    "although neither of them are severe enough to jeopardize the results presented in  3 and  5 that the expansion is real , each can be overcome by more data with expanded boundary conditions on the parameters compared to the data used here .    first , the principal uncertainty at small radii ( log r @xmath195 ) is the position of the zero - redshift fiducial line in the @xmath68 , log r diagram , relative to which the @xmath22 depressions for high - redshift galaxies are compared . the postman & lauer ( 1995 ) data",
    "( figure 2 of paper i ) do not extend to radii smaller then log r(pc ) @xmath196 .",
    "their data are confined to the first ranked cluster early - type galaxies .",
    "they do not sample into the luminosity function of each cluster to provide data for smaller galaxies .",
    "we have extended the data to smaller radii with the sample in sandage & perelmuter ( 1991 ) to generate a non - linear correction at small radii to the best - fit linear equations to the postman & lauer ( 1995 ) data ( see table 3 of paper i ) .",
    "however , the sandage & perelmuter ( 1991 ) data are also only for the first few , brightest cluster galaxies , again not going far into the fainter part of the luminosity function .",
    "hence , although table 3 of paper i gives our adopted extension to radii as small as log r(pc ) @xmath197 , the uncertainties are large and can be reduced by a more complete study of the @xmath22 , log r relation for fainter and smaller galaxies at low redshift .",
    "second , the three clusters studied here are near the faint end of the distribution of absolute magnitude of first ranked galaxies in , for example , the sample of first ranked cluster galaxies whose data are listed by kristian , sandage & westphal ( 1978 ) .",
    "the mean of the distribution of absolute magnitude in the @xmath8 band for the kristian et al .",
    "sample is @xmath198 , whereas the first - ranked early - type galaxies in the three clusters studied have absolute magnitudes of @xmath199 for cl 1604 + 4321 , @xmath200 for cl 1604 + 4304 , and @xmath201 for cl 1324 + 3011 ( see plo01 ) .",
    "( note again that the system of @xmath202 magnitudes used by kristian et al .",
    "is 0.25 mag brighter than the cape @xmath8 system used here ) .",
    "the galaxies in the three clusters studied here have fainter absolute magnitudes and smaller radii than the average local clusters , exacerbating the problem described above .",
    "richer high - redshift clusters with brighter and , therefore , larger first - ranked galaxies are known .",
    "a study of the hst data from such clusters will improve the present tolman test .",
    "we suspect that the present experiment is only the beginning of similar work that will be done in the coming years with hst on such clusters as they are discovered and observed .",
