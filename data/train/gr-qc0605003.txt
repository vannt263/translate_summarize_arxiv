    "it is believed that black hole thermodynamics hold important clues to the nature of the structure of spacetime at the very small scale .",
    "for example the finiteness of black hole entropy is understood as a direct manifestation of the discreetness of spacetime at the planck scale , and points out to a necessary reduction of the number of degrees of freedom on the horizon @xcite .",
    "a piece of evidence for this comes from the contribution of the thermal atmosphere ( i.e the entropy stored in the field quanta near the horizon ) to the black hole entropy which was shown to be divergent in absence of any uv cutoff which goes against the finiteness of black hole entropy @xcite .",
    "this divergence is closely related to the entanglement entropy ( or geometric entropy ) considered in @xcite and later in @xcite .",
    "the notion of entanglement entropy originates from the simple observation that an observer outside the horizon has no access to the degrees of freedom behind the horizon . for this reason the outside observer would describe the world with a reduced density matrix obtained by tracing out the unaccessible degrees of freedom behind the horizon .",
    "if the exterior modes and the external modes are correlated `` entangled '' the resulting density operator is thermal even if the global state of the system were pure .",
    "the entanglement entropy has a uv divergence which can not be renormalized away , at least when calculated for fields in a fixed background .",
    "moreover in @xcite it was shown that the divergences in the entanglement entropy are the same divergences one must deal with when trying to renormalize the theory of gravity coupled to matter , and therefore understanding the finiteness of the entropy may not be possible without a complete knowledge of the uv behavior of the theory .",
    "however if we introduce a short distance cutoff around the planck length one obtains a finite entropy of the same order of magnitude as that of a black hole .",
    "this entanglement entropy generally scales like the area of the boundary .",
    "this has led to many speculations attributing the black hole entropy to the sum of all entanglement entropies of the fields in nature @xcite .",
    "whether or not the entanglement of quantum fields furnishes all of the entropy or part of it , contribution of this type must be present , and any consistent theory must provide for them in its thermodynamic accounting .",
    "although the entanglement entropy has been extensively explored by many authors most of the work was oriented toward computing it using different regularization methods and studying the degree and the universality of the divergences @xcite .",
    "for instance in @xcite it was shown that except in @xmath5-dimensions the coefficient of the divergences is non - universal and depends on the regularization method .",
    "therefore any quantitative comparison of different calculations was not possible .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the entanglement entropy on some fuzzy spaces and draw possible conclusions about the entanglement entropy on non - commutative spaces in general .",
    "the motivations for considering the entanglement entropy on fuzzy spaces are many .",
    "one obvious reason is the general hope that non - commutativity would soften uv divergences and may render uv divergent quantities finite as it is the case on fuzzy spaces , and at the same time preserve the basic symmetry of the space .",
    "for instance results from finite - temperature non - commutative field theory showed that the non - commutative model behaves as if it had many fewer degrees of freedom in the uv than in conventional field theory . in some cases the degrees of freedom were so drastically reduced that the uv catastrophe could be avoided .",
    "see @xcite and references therein .",
    "another motivation is that non - commutative geometry arises naturally in some limits of string theory in connection with d - branes . in effect",
    "it has recently been suggested by many authors that the microstates counting of non extremal black holes using field theory dual of string theory could be interpreted as arising from entanglement @xcite . in considering entanglement entropy on fuzzy or noncommutative spaces",
    "one faces the question of defining the boundary with respect to which the entanglement is to be computed .",
    "indeed in view of the non locality of non commutative theory one would expect any boundary to be fuzzy .",
    "this also brings in the question how to define disjoint regions in non - commutative or fuzzy spaces in order to properly define the entanglement entropy .",
    "we will show in this paper that once the field variables are properly chosen there is almost a unique way to obtain entanglement between different degrees of freedom in different regions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "@xmath6 we give a brief review of the formalism which we will use .",
    "in particular we compute the entanglement entropy for a free scalar theory defined on the continuum sphere . in section @xmath7 ,",
    "part @xmath8 we compute the entanglement entropy resulting from tracing half of a fuzzy sphere and show that the result is proportional to the number of boundary degrees of freedom or equivalently to the area of the boundary . in part @xmath6 of section @xmath7 we reconsider the same problem on a truncated moyal plane , i.e a fuzzy disc , and obtain similar results as in fuzzy sphere case .",
    "we also discuss the moyal plane limit and observe that if the ignored region is blown up a uv - ir mixing phenomenon takes place .",
    "we conclude in section @xmath9 by general discussions and possible improvement of our numerical results .",
    "in this section we review the main formalism we will be using and apply it to a regularized continuum sphere .",
    "for detail of the formalism we refer the reader to @xcite . for",

    "this entails the computation of the eigenvalues of @xmath33 for each pair of values @xmath74 and then computing the   entropy by means of equation ( [ s_n ] ) .",
    "however to obtain a numerical result the sum over @xmath44 must be cutoff at some value @xmath75 .",
    "this can be decided by the following simple observation similar to that in @xcite . for large @xmath44 , @xmath76 ,",
    "the @xmath44-dependent term dominates over the other terms and @xmath68 can be computed perturbatively .",

    "the ground state density matrix is easily seen to be @xmath155 it is worth mentioning here that the formalism of the fuzzy sphere bears a lot of similarity to the lattice regularization of the continuum discussed in the previous section .",
    "however the fuzzy sphere provides a natural cutoff for the quantum number @xmath44 which is playing a similar role to the azimuthal number of the continuum sphere .",
    "having brought the hamiltonian on the fuzzy sphere to the form we want we are ready now to discuss the entanglement entropy in the fuzzy sphere setting .",
    "first we note that in order to introduce the entanglement entropy we need to divide the field degrees of freedom into two sets residing in two disjoint regions corresponding , say , to the upper and lower fuzzy hemispheres . in order to do that",
    "rigourously one needs to give precise criterion that allows one to decide whether a given set of two fields ( two matrices ) have a disjoint support on the fuzzy sphere .",
    "although we believe that deriving such criterion may not be difficult we shall content ourselves to some heuristic and intuitive arguments .",
    "we first note that the form of the hamiltonian suggests strongly that we take each sector @xmath156 and trace over half of the degrees of freedom .",
    "for a fixed @xmath30 and @xmath44 the number of degrees of freedom in the sector @xmath156 is @xmath154 , if @xmath154 is even we trace out the following degrees of freedom @xmath157 if @xmath154 is odd we have two options , either we trace out @xmath158 or we trace out @xmath159 however both options lead to the same entanglement entropy for large @xmath30 and the degrees of freedom @xmath160 will be interpreted as boundary degrees of freedom and there are @xmath30 of them .",
    "this corresponds in the original matrix notation to dividing the matrix @xmath92 into two parts , upper left triangle @xmath161 and right lower triangle @xmath162 .",
    "for example for the first option above for @xmath163 the @xmath164 and @xmath162 will look as follows    @xmath165    the components @xmath166 are the boundary degrees of freedom . @xmath164 and @xmath162 can be given the interpretation of corresponding to functions with disjoint supports , one on the lower half and the other on the upper half of the fuzzy sphere . a hint for this comes from the observation that @xmath167 , for arbitrary @xmath164 and @xmath162 and the fact that we are working in the basis where @xmath120 is diagonal and therefore one can talk about negative and positive @xmath64 coordinates ( i.e upper and lower hemisphere ) .",
    "indeed this is the only choice that leads to a non - zero entanglement entropy . now from equation @xmath168 one can easily see that the resulting reduced density operator will be @xmath169 and the associated entropy is @xmath170 where @xmath68 is computed using equation @xmath69 with @xmath171 defined by @xmath172 where @xmath15 is the square root of the potential matrix @xmath173 given by equation ( [ v ] ) .",
    "the indices @xmath28 run from @xmath174 to @xmath175 ( the available region ) .",
    "since we expect our entropy to be proportional to the circumference of the equator which can be said to be a fuzzy circle , we define a scaled entropy by dividing the entropy by the square root of the casimir @xmath106 , viz @xmath176 we compute the scaled entropy @xmath177 numerically for @xmath178 and run several numerical calculations with different values of the mass .",
    "the results are depicted on figure 2 .",
    "we can immediately see that the different curves with masses @xmath179 approach the same value for large @xmath30 .",
    "for example for @xmath180 the scaled entropy for the different masses is equal to @xmath181 and the discrepancy between the four different values being in the third digit .",
    "we can thus safely extrapolate to very large @xmath107 or @xmath30 and conclude that the entropy is given by @xmath182 since the radius of the fuzzy sphere can be scaled with @xmath107 keeping the noncommutativity parameter @xmath183 fixed , we can write the entropy in the following form @xmath184 this is exactly the area law in two dimension .    some remarks about our numerical evaluations for the entropy are in order . as in any numerical calculation , numerical errors are inevitable . in our calculation",
    "numerical errors originate from rounding errors and iteration , however it turns out that they are really tiny , in worst cases of order @xmath185 .",
    "indeed none of our matrices is ill - conditioned or nearly singular to a working precision , therefore one should not for instance expect significant errors to occur by inversion .",
    "now , despite the fact that numerical errors are really small the exact numerical value for the leading contribution to the scaled entropy can not be extrapolated from our numerical result , because as figure @xmath6 shows there are subleading corrections which are nonvanishing , although small , for finite @xmath107 and affect the rate of convergence .",
    "although one can not obtain the form of the subleading corrections , our numerical calculations show that they are negligible for large @xmath107 , for example they are of order @xmath186 for @xmath180 and for the values of the mass we used .     resulting from tracing out half of the fuzzy sphere.,width=453 ]    having established the area law , let us now turn to a simpler and more interesting interpretation of the result obtained . since equation @xmath187 is valid for large @xmath107 we can write it as @xmath188 therefore the entropy is directly proportional to the number of the degrees of freedom on the dividing boundary , in this case being a `` fuzzy circle '' .",
    "this result fits with the picture of the horizon ( simulated here by the equator ) as being divided or quantized into small cells of planck size with each cell carrying roughly one bit of information @xcite .",
    "the picture geos along the same line with old suggestion that the area of a black hole have a quantized spectrum .",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "we conclude this section by few comments about the result for the massless case .",
    "for relatively small values of @xmath30 or @xmath107 there is a clear mass dependence which dominates the behavior of the entropy .",
    "the entropy is a decreasing function of the mass as can be seen from figure @xmath6 .",
    "however it shows a discontinuity at zero mass where it drops from large values for small masses to small values for zero mass .",
    "however this discontinuous behavior disappears for very large @xmath107 and the entropy has a smooth dependence on the mass . to understand the zero mass discontinuity we go back to the original potential .",
    "it is easy to see from equation ( [ v ] ) that the potential @xmath189 of the sector @xmath190 is a singular matrix in the massless case and therefore one can not apply directly the formalism of section @xmath6 .",
    "however , once treated carefully one can easily show that the sector @xmath190 gives zero contribution to the entanglement entropy and therefore must be projected out from the sum in equation ( [ 2.4 ] ) .",
    "in the massless case the associated entropy is therefore @xmath191 all the terms @xmath68 are computed using the same formalism of section @xmath6 since none of the potentials @xmath192 is singular .",
    "moreover , for large @xmath107 ( the continuum limit ) the main contribution to @xmath177 comes from the sectors with @xmath44 different from zero , and the term @xmath193 becomes irrelevant which explains the smooth behavior for large @xmath107 .",
    "for instance already at @xmath194 and for @xmath195 both equations ( [ 2.10 ] ) and ( [ 2.4 ] ) give for @xmath196 the same value @xmath197 .",
    "now the reason for which previous lattice computation , like the one presented in the first section and the one in @xcite , were not sensitive to this effect is due to the fact that those lattice regularizations break the translation symmetry or rotation symmetry to which the zero modes of the potential are related .",
    "we consider now a scalar theory on @xmath198 where @xmath199 is now the moyal plane .",
    "the action is given by : @xmath200 the trace is infinite dimensional and the laplacian is given in terms of creation and annihilation operators @xmath201 and @xmath202 by the experssion @xmath203=-\\frac{4}{\\theta^{2}}[a,[a^{+},\\phi]].\\ ] ] let us recall that @xmath204={\\theta}$ ] where @xmath205 is the noncommutativity parameter .",
    "the fuzzy disc is obtained from the plane following @xcite as follows .",

    "indeed unlike the fuzzy sphere none of the matrices @xmath296 is singular , and this is due to the fact that the fuzzy laplacian in the massless case has no zero modes because of the breaking of translation invariance , therefore the massless case does not need special treatment .",
    "furthermore for massive field it can easily be shown ( numerically ) that unless the mass is of the order of the cutoff e.g @xmath297 , the resulting entropy has the same value as the massless case . however , if the @xmath297 the resulting entropy differs slightly from the massless case but starts to converge towards the value of the massless case for large @xmath30 .",
    "now we turn to the area interpretation of our results .",
    "first it must be noted that despite the work of @xcite the fuzzy disc is still a poor understood object and our discussion are at the tentative and qualitative level .",
    "the radius of the fuzzy disc is defined through the equation @xmath298 . in order to interpret equation ( [ 3.2 ] ) as an area low in two dimension let us define the effective short distance cutoff for the disc and all we can obtain is a pure number .",
    "however the fact that the entropy is proportional to the number of degrees of freedom on the boundary makes the area interpretation natural . ] to be @xmath299 .",
    "thus equation ( [ 3.2 ] ) becomes ( with @xmath300 is the diameter of the disc ) @xmath301 in the continuum limit @xmath302 with @xmath303 fixed ( the limit of the continuum disc of radius @xmath303 ) we recover the usual uv divergence since in that limit @xmath304",
    ".    similarly we can write equation ( [ 3.1 ] ) ( with @xmath305 , @xmath306 and @xmath307 is the circumference of the disc given by @xmath308 ) as @xmath309 again in the commutative limit @xmath310 with @xmath311 fixed ( the limit of the continuum disc of radius @xmath311 ) we recover the usual uv divergence .",
    "although the two resulting entanglement entropies considered in the fuzzy disc case diverge in the commutative limits of the continuum discs they have different limits when @xmath312 with @xmath205 fixed which is the noncommutative limit of the moyal plane .    in the case of equation (",
    "[ 3.5 ] ) if we keep the size of the small disc finite i.e @xmath32 finite , the result remains finite even in the limit @xmath313 .",
    "taking our calculation as a regularization of the moyal plane then we would expect the entanglement entropy resulting from ignoring a finite region ( disc ) to be finite and proportional to the number of degrees of freedom on the boundary of the ignored region .    for the case of equation ( [ 3.4 ] )",
    "taking the limit @xmath314 amounts also to recovering the moyal plane .",
    "however the region which we are ignoring now is half of the moyal plane and it is not of finite size . from equation ( [ 3.4 ] ) we see that the entropy per unit length which is given by @xmath315 diverges as @xmath30 approaches infinity . but this divergence is not of uv origin since it shows up as a consequence of blowing up the ignored region , i.e the divergence is a consequence of integrating out an infinite number of degrees of freedom . furthermore we observe that regardless of the value of @xmath30 the entropy per unit length diverges in the limit @xmath316 which is the standard uv divergence . indeed in the continuum case",
    "the entropy ( per unit area ) can be rendered finite by just introducing short distance cutoff in the normal direction , and no ir cutoff is needed .",
    "therefore the divergence of the entropy in this moyal plane limit can be understood as a uv - ir mixing rather than just coming from uv origin .",
    "we have computed numerically the entanglement entropies of a scalar field on different fuzzy spaces . for the fuzzy sphere",
    "we have shown that the entropy resulting from tracing out half of the sphere is proportional to the number of non - commutative degrees of freedom on the boundary .",
    "the same problem was considered on a fuzzy disc and two ways of tracing were considered . in the first case we computed the entropy resulting from tracing out the degrees of freedom residing in a smaller sub - disc . in the second case we considered the entropy resulting from tracing half of the fuzzy disc . in both cases",
    "the entanglement entropy turned out to be proportional to the number of degrees of freedom on the boundary . in the commutative limit",
    "both entropies suffer from the standard uv divergences .",
    "however in the moyal plane limit the two entropies showed different behavior . whereas the first entropy , resulting from ignoring the degrees of freedom inside a fuzzy sub - disc , remained finite",
    "when the disc becomes a moyal plane , the second entropy per unite area ( length ) resulting from ignoring half of the fuzzy disc diverges in the moyal plane limit .",
    "the divergence in the moyal limit could easily be seen to be arising from an uv - ir mixing .",
    "therefore we would in general expect non - commutativity to render the entanglement entropy finite as long as the ignored region is of a finite size , as is the case for the black hole .",
    "however , if the ignored region is not of a finite size , the entropy per unite area may still be divergent but now due to an ir - uv mixing .",
    "finally it would be interesting to investigate the divergences of the entanglement entropy per unite area in the moyal plane using analytical method not just numerical .",
    "one possible approach would still be to approximate the moyal plane by a fuzzy disc and use @xmath317 expansion to evaluate the entropy .",
