    "the distribution of these confining forces throughout the material is a complex process that involves a highly inhomogeneous network of contact forces  @xcite .",
    "force networks as shown in figure  [ fig1]a are typical for a broad variety of amorphous systems like foams , colloids and emulsions , and play a crucial role for understanding the macroscopic mechanical properties  @xcite .",
    "a robust feature of these `` jammed '' materials is that they can sustain a certain amount of shear stress before failure  @xcite .",
    "there are many aspects that influence this shear resistance or internal friction of a granular material .",
    "a well known example is that wet sand can sustain much larger shear stresses than dry sand , due to the presence of attractive liquid bridges  @xcite .",
    "the strength of the assembly is also enhanced by increasing intergrain friction or roughness of the grains . however",
    ", if one slowly increases the applied shear stress and follows the evolution of contact forces and grain locations , one encounters very complex collective phenomena . before the system yields as a whole",
    ", there are non - adiabatic precursor events such as local rearrangements due to instability of subsets of grains @xcite .",
    "this will induce changes in fabric and coordination number , and it has remained a great challenge to understand how this couples back to the stress state  @xcite . the conventional tool to study this problem is direct numerical simulation of the particle dynamics .",
    "while this provides valuable information on the micromechanics of sheared granular materials , it remains very difficult to distinguish the relative importance of contact and force anisotropies : both are evolving simultaneously .",
    "recently , a different strategy based on `` ensembles of force networks '' has been proposed to address this problem  @xcite . in this approach one",
    "investigates the statistics of _ all _ possible force network configurations that are mechanically stable , for a _ single _ fixed packing geometry of grains  @xcite .",
    "this allows explicit separation of the effects of forces and texture , e.g. by studying the force ensembles for packs of different fabric and coordination numbers .",
    "consistent with direct simulations @xcite , the ensemble showed that packings close to the minimum isostatic coordination number can hardly support any stress whereas strongly hyperstatic packings ( much higher coordination numbers ) can sustain much more stress @xcite . at the same time",

    "the analysis is based on an intriguing observation made in the force network ensemble for strongly hyperstatic packs .",
    "the most elementary manifestation of force anisotropy is the modulation of the average force @xmath4 , as a function of the contact orientation @xmath1 . from figure  [ fig1]b , obtained from a two - dimensional frictionless system , it is clear that the force anisotropy is limited by the requirement that the normal component @xmath5 for all @xmath1 .",
    "this is due to the repulsive nature of the contact forces which require all @xmath6 .",
    "indeed , it was found that this simple criterion provides a very good approximation of the maximum shear stress achieved in the force network ensemble , in the limit of hyperstatic packs @xcite .",
    "it also gives a good prediction for the limiting form of @xmath4 upon approaching the maximum load .",
    "the quantity @xmath4 thus provides crucial information on the force anisotropy and has recently been accessed experimentally for the first time @xcite . to generalize the arguments above to frictional systems",
    ", we have to translate the physical constraints for all individual contact forces ,    * normal forces are purely repulsive , i.e. @xmath7 * tangential forces @xmath8 obey coulomb s law of friction , @xmath9 ,    to constraints for @xmath4 . here , @xmath10 is the coulomb friction coefficient of the individual contacts .",
    "we show how this yields nontrivial predictions for the maximum stress by finding the extreme forms of @xmath4 .",
    "while these maxima can probably not be reached in real systems , they describe the strongly hyperstatic limit of the force network ensemble , making it a well - defined analytical tool to investigate the influence of the micromechanical parameters on the effective macroscopic friction .",
    "the optimization approach followed in the present paper is in the same spirit as the force network ensemble , in the sense that it deals with the question if a force network with given parameters can exist or not , rather than with the actual evolution of a sheared granular system .",
    "on the other hand , while force balance on each grain is explicitly taken into account in the force network ensemble , it plays no role in our analysis of @xmath11 .",
    "this is allowed in the strongly hyperstatic limit , but not for nearly isostatic packs . in the latter case",
    "the force networks are to a large extent determined by the conditions of force balance  @xcite .",
    "the relevant macroscopic quantity is the deviatoric stress , defined as @xmath12 , where the @xmath13 denote the principal values of the stress tensor .",
    "we work in the coordinate frame where @xmath14 , so we can express the deviatoric stress as @xmath0 .",
    "for cohesionless systems one may naively expect that the ultimate shear stress is achieved when one principal direction becomes tensile , e.g. @xmath15 , which would lead to @xmath16 . by invoking realistic structures of @xmath4 for granular packs , however ,",
    "we show that the physics is in fact much more subtle , and that the real maximum is typically much lower than unity .",
    "our main findings are that the effect of friction between grains is only mild : a typical coulomb friction coefficient of @xmath17 increases @xmath18 by only 16% as compared to the frictionless case .",
    "we also find that realistic anisotropies in the contact fabric hardly increase @xmath18 and thus seem to play a subdominant role in real systems .    .",

    "the third section addresses the simplest case of isotropic , frictionless packings , and shows how the granularity of the material affects the maximally supportable shear stress . in sections  [ sec.frictional ] and [ sec.anisotropy ]",
    "we explore the effects of intergrain friction and fabric anisotropies on the maximum shear stress .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec.discussion ] , where we argue how our approach can be applied to problems of anisotropic elasticity .",

    "we can express the stress tensor in a statistical form , evaluating the average @xmath37 from the probability to find a contact with force @xmath33 and centre - to - centre vector @xmath38 . in terms of normal and tangential components , and with the observation that the forces are uncorrelated to the interparticle distance @xmath39  @xcite , this involves the joint probability @xmath40 .",
    "we can explicitly factorize the contact angle probability @xmath41 to write @xmath42 the distribution @xmath43 has been introduced recently  @xcite and is properly normalized to unity . hence",

    "these directions must then be lines of mirror symmetry , as is illustrated in figure  [ fig2 ] , which makes that @xmath53 for even @xmath54 and @xmath55 for odd @xmath54 .    for the moment , until the last section of the paper , we will consider the case where the fabric is isotropic so @xmath56 . in that case , inserting equations ( [ expfn],[expft ] ) in ( [ stresstensor ] ) and integrating yields @xmath57 all higher order terms in the expansion yield zero upon integration .",
    "our main interest is the deviatoric stress , so we are free to choose the pressure scale as @xmath58 , so that @xmath59 and @xmath60 this relation reveals how an applied shear stress can be sustained through anisotropies in both the normal and frictional forces , via @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively  @xcite",
    ". the strategy will be to explore the physical limitations of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which will provide a bound on @xmath63 .",
    "note that due to the linearity of ( [ stresss ] ) , the stress only couples to the first moment of the force distributions .",
    "this means that the stress does not depend on details of the probability @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "also , the stress tensor contains no information on `` force chains '' , i.e.  the tendency of large forces the align in a correlated way .",
    "( [ stresss ] ) does not invoke products of different @xmath65 so that spatial force - force correlations do not come into play .",
    "we start out with packings of frictionless particles , for which the problem of the maximum possible deviatoric stress is relatively straightforward . in this case",
    "a bound on @xmath63 emerges from the purely repulsive nature of the forces : all contacts have @xmath66 , so certainly the averages should obey    @xmath67    for all values of @xmath1 .",
    "this condition obviously forms a serious restriction on the amplitude of the force anisotropy , and we show how this yields an upper limit on @xmath63 . we show that this maximum value @xmath18 depends on the number @xmath68 of terms included in the fourier series of ( [ expfn ] ) : even though the higher order terms do not contribute to the stress , they enable @xmath34 to reach more extreme shapes .",
    "we first explore the case @xmath69 , which is the relevant case for real systems ( see also [ appcoord ] ) .",
    "then we discuss the problem for arbitraty @xmath68 , which provides some additional insights .",
    "for the frictionless case we have from ( [ tauforward ] ) @xmath71 so that ( [ expfn ] ) becomes @xmath72 let us first consider the simplest case , in which we truncate after the lowest anistropic term , i.e.  @xmath73 , so that @xmath63 is the only free parameter . for positive @xmath63",
    "this function has a minimum in @xmath74 , which touches @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "hence , @xmath77 . in the same way we could derive @xmath78",
    "from now on we will only consider positive @xmath63 , without loss of generality .    from the numerical result of figure  [ fig1]b it is clear that the modulation does not stay symmetric around @xmath79 for large values of @xmath63 .",
    "this indicates a significant contribution of the type @xmath80 .",
    "this is the highest order term that we can expect to be relevant in granular matter , because steric exclusion between the grains sets a lower limit to the width of peaks in @xmath70 .",
    "this is explained in more detail in [ appcoord ] .",
    "we thus focus on the case @xmath69 in the expansion  ( [ expfn ] ) .",
    "the optimization problem involves two free parameters , @xmath63 and @xmath81 .",
    "we are free to vary @xmath81 in such a way as to facilitate a maximum @xmath63 , under the constraint that @xmath82 for all @xmath1 .",
    "we furthermore demand that @xmath70 evolves monotonically between the principal directions at @xmath83 and @xmath74 .",
    "this implies that the minimum of @xmath70 should stay at @xmath74 , as it is the case in the numerics of figure  [ fig1]b .",
    "physically , this means that the first contacts to break are those oriented in the direction in which the material is stretched .",
    "while the expansion ensures that there is an extremum in @xmath74 , this extremum only remains a minimum if @xmath84 the value of @xmath70 in this minimum must satisfy @xmath85 this defines a linear program with parameters @xmath63 and @xmath81 , two inequalities , and the objective to maximize @xmath63 .",
    "the solution is easily found to be  , we have to check that the fourth derivative is positive to be sure that the extremum is a minimum , which is indeed the case . ]",
    "@xmath86 figure  [ fig1]b illustrates the relevance of this bound for strongly hyperstatic packings : the numerical @xmath70 ( taken from  @xcite ) indeed approaches the limiting form ( dashed curve )    @xmath87    so indeed , the system is able to organize the forces in such a manner as to optimize the sustained shear stress .       for @xmath69 ( solid ) , @xmath89 ( dashed ) .",
    "the figure in the corner illustrates the corresponding average force exerted on a particle for various contact orientations ( @xmath69).,width=325 ]    although fourier terms with @xmath90 do not play a role in granular systems , it is insightful to study the general case where we truncate the series at arbitrary order @xmath68 .",
    "the expansion now contains @xmath68 free coefficients that we need to fix , in order to optimize @xmath63 . in the case @xmath69 , we invoked the condition @xmath91 at @xmath74 to ensure that the minor principal axis remains a minimum of @xmath70 , and taking @xmath92 turned out to maximize @xmath63 .",
    "a nonzero @xmath93 term allows to also fix @xmath94 in such a way that @xmath63 becomes even larger .",
    "the upshot of adding more terms is that we can make @xmath70 as flat ( and as close to zero ) as possible around @xmath74 , where the contribution to the overlap with @xmath95 is negative .",
    "every time we have to verify that the first nonzero taylor coefficient when expanding around @xmath74 is positive , so that we are indeed dealing with a minimum .",
    "the general scheme is thus that adding the term of order @xmath54 generates an additional condition that @xmath96 . for general @xmath68 ,",
    "this yields the following set of linear equations :    @xmath97    in [ appvandermonde ] we show that this linear problem for the fourier coefficients can be inverted analytically , yielding a remarkably simple result for the maximum @xmath63 , namely    @xmath98    interestingly , this reveals an ultimate ( mathematical ) maximum shear stress @xmath16 .",
    "we plotted the optimized @xmath70 for various values of @xmath68 ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) : clearly , @xmath70 evolves towards the extreme case of a dirac @xmath99-peak in the limit @xmath100 .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , this condition of @xmath101 precisely corresponds to the point where the minor principal axis becomes tensile .",
    "we thus conclude that , due to the finite width of @xmath70 , the maximum stress for a frictionless packing lies well below the point where the global stress unavoidably develops a tensile direction .",
    "we have argued in [ appcoord ] that this finite width is in fact due to steric exclusion between neighbouring grains .",
    "this illustrates how the discrete nature of the assembly has an important effect on global properties .",
    "the presence of frictional forces provides an additional degree of freedom to develop anisotropic stresses : equation  ( [ tauforward ] ) shows that the total deviatoric is the sum of the ( lowest order ) anistropies of normal and tangential forces .",
    "it is clear that this will enhance the ability to sustain a large external load .",
    "however , there is again a bound on the force anisotropies , now due to coulomb s law for individual contacts , i.e.  @xmath103 , where @xmath10 is the microscopic coulomb friction coefficient .",
    "since this condition should hold for any pair of grains , it certainly holds for the averages :    @xmath104 . in this section",
    "we derive how @xmath18 depends on the value of @xmath10 , again using the fourier expansions of @xmath70 and @xmath105 up to @xmath69 .      from ( [ tauforward ] )",
    "we can express @xmath106 so that @xmath107 let us now take a value of @xmath63 slightly above the frictionless limit @xmath108 .",
    "the prefactor in front of the @xmath109 term can now be lowered due to @xmath62 , i.e.  due to the presence of friction .",
    "if we put @xmath63 far above @xmath108 , however , one requires a relatively large @xmath62 .",

    "the solid lines represent @xmath110 , the dash - dotted line @xmath111 , which has to satisfy ( [ coulombaverage ] ) .",
    "the figure in the corner illustrates the average force exerted on a frictional particle for various contact orientations .",
    "note that these forces now have tangential components.,width=325 ]    to determine the maximum value of @xmath63 as a function of @xmath10 , we have to specify acceptable values of the higher order coefficients @xmath81 and @xmath112 , which do not contribute to the stress tensor . as we did in the frictionless case",
    ", we demand that the function @xmath70 evolves monotonically between major and minor directions , so that it has only one maximum ( in the major direction ) and only one minimum ( in the minor direction ) .",
    "a similar requirement is imposed on @xmath105 : the average tangential force only changes sign along the principal directions , see e.g. figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "if this were not the case , the tangential forces would swap from clockwise to counterclockwise and back in between the major and minor directions .",
    "such a spontaneous symmetry breaking would introduce a very nongeneric organization of forces within the packing .",
    "these conditions put bounds on the second order coefficients , @xmath113    we have numerically solved this optimization problem by varying all possible values of the parameters @xmath114 , within the ranges imposed by equations  ( [ coulombaverage],[boundb2],[boundc2 ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "surprisingly , the dependence on @xmath10 is relatively weak . in the paragraph below",
    "we obtain the analytical result ,    @xmath115 which is derived for @xmath116 .",
    "however , figure  [ fig5 ] shows that this is a very good approximation outside this range as well .     for frictional packings with isotropic fabric .",

    "the inset shows an enlargement of the small @xmath10 region.,width=325 ]      the set of parameters @xmath121 that corresponds to the maximum value of @xmath63 obviously corresponds to functions @xmath105 and @xmath122 that are tangent in at least one point .",
    "we will now derive the optimal set of parameters for the case there is a tangent point in the interval @xmath123 , and then determine for what range of @xmath10 this is the case .    in the interval",

    "we want to have a @xmath62 which is large ( to facilitate larger @xmath63 ) , and at the same time a @xmath105 which is as close to zero as possible ( to stay away from violating ( [ coulombaverage ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath112 should have its maximum value @xmath127 , as dictated by ( [ boundc2 ] ) .",
    "similarly , we want @xmath70 to be as large as possible , and hence because @xmath128 is positive in the considered interval , @xmath81 should also be maximal .",
    "there are two upper bounds on @xmath81 , given by ( [ boundb2 ] ) and @xmath129 , the latter of which turns out to be the most restrictive one .",
    "this gives @xmath130 having eliminated @xmath81 and @xmath112 , we have thus reduced the optimization problem to 2 parameters , namely @xmath63 and @xmath62 .",
    "to find the parameters that maximize @xmath63 , we take the equality sign in ( [ coulombaverage ] ) and demand that solutions are tangent points . for arbitrary values of the parameters",
    ", there is a tangent point in @xmath131 and two normal intersection points in @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the intersection points should coincide to turn into a tangent point .",

    "this requirement is met for values of @xmath10 satisfying @xmath140 this validity is indeed found numerically in figure  [ fig5 ] .",

    "is below @xmath141 , where the @xmath128 is negative , so @xmath81 should now be as small as possible : @xmath142 .",
    "the resulting quartic equations can be solved using computer algebra , yielding a lenghty expression ( not shown ) , which is plotted as the dashed part of the curve in figure  [ fig5 ] , and which coincides with the numerical data .",

    "when the coulomb coefficient becomes very large , the sustainable shear stress is mostly due to the tangential forces .",
    "because the right hand side of ( [ coulombaverage ] ) grows linearly with @xmath10 , the values of @xmath62 and @xmath112 can also scale as @xmath10 when @xmath145 .",
    "this leads to an to an asymptotic behaviour of @xmath102 which is linear in @xmath10 .",
    "we numerically determined the parameters @xmath146 for the asymptotic @xmath70 and @xmath111 by optimizing for @xmath147 instead of @xmath63 .",

    "as a function of friction coefficient @xmath10 for @xmath149.,width=325 ]    we now analyze the effect of a fabric anisotropy on the maximum shear stress . the structure of the contact network can be characterized using the fabric tensor @xmath150 , and a fabric anisotropy shows up as a difference between the principal values of this tensor , @xmath151 .",
    "analogous to the stress tensor , this difference is solely determined by the lowest order coefficient of the fourier expansion of @xmath41 , the contact angle distribution , which we therefore approximate as   term of ( [ contactfourier ] ) . ] @xmath152 one easily shows that @xmath153 .",
    "the strategy is to again find the maximum possible value for @xmath63 , but now for @xmath154 .",
    "let us note that this truncated form for @xmath41 is a good approximation for systems with a simple shear deformation history  @xcite , although more complex forms are encountered e.g. for packings formed under gravity @xcite . as was demonstrated by troadec _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , the values for @xmath155 are bounded by the effect of steric exclusion between neighbouring contacts ( in the same way as steric exclusion bounds the force anisotropy , see also [ appcoord ] ) .",

    "@xmath157  @xcite .",
    "we thus insert the form ( [ contactfourier ] ) in the expression for the stress tensor ( [ stresstensor ] ) , yielding @xmath158 this time the second order coefficients _ do _ affect the value of the deviatoric stress directly .",
    "the idea of the optimization procedure , however , remains the same as in the isotropic case . in this section we present the results of the optimization .",
    "the frictionless case , which has an analytic solution , is discussed in more detail in [ appanis ] .",
    "we again eliminate @xmath159 by setting @xmath160 in ( [ anisxx ] ) . from ( [ anisxy ] )",
    "we then have @xmath161 working out the optimization for the frictionless case ( @xmath162 ) , we get the analytic result @xmath163 as is shown in [ appanis ] .",
    "the inclusion of fabric anisotropy hence leads to a small increase of the maximum deviatoric stress ; for e.g.  @xmath164 we get a 5% increase .",
    "see also the numerical data points on the vertical axis of figure  [ fig6 ] .    for the complete case , with anisotropic fabric and finite friction coefficient ,",
    "we have used the same numerical optimization procedure as in section  [ subsec.fricopt ] .",
    "the result is shown for @xmath165 in figure  [ fig6 ] . from this figure",
    "one can see that the combined effect of friction and anisotropy can roughly be seen as an addition of their individual effects .",
    "the repulsive - only interaction between dry grains causes the shear stress sustained by granular materials to be bounded .",
    "we have derived these upper bounds , @xmath18 , by finding the extreme shapes of the angle - resolved average force , @xmath4 , that are consistent with coulomb s friction law for individual grains . in the spirit of the force network ensemble , the key question addressed in the present paper is `` can such a force network exist ? '' , and we have argued that our analysis represents the strongly hyperstatic limit of the ensemble .",
    "the yielding process in real systems is much more involved and can not be fully described by the existence criteria used in the paper .",
    "however , the analysis does allow to investigate the influence of the micromechanical parameters on the maximum shear stress , in such a way that different aspects can be disentangled .",
    "this provides useful complementary information to simulation methods , for which the packing texture can not be controlled during loading . for example",
    ", we have found that an anisotropic fabric is not needed to sustain a large shear stress , and in fact adding fabric anisotropy hardly increases the maximum stress .",
    "this suggests that shear - induced textures observed in numerical simulations  @xcite play a relatively passive role in the stress balance .",
    "secondly , we analyzed the effect of the microscopic friction coefficient @xmath10 , and found that @xmath18 does not increase rapidly with @xmath10 in the physically relevant regime ( figure  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "one has to be very careful , however , to interpret this result .",
    "the presence of friction _ does _ have an important influence on the coordination number , which in turn affects the shear resistance : our analysis breaks down close to the isostatic limit , at which the force balance equations become dominant and @xmath18 drops to zero  @xcite .",
    "consistent with our analysis , the internal friction measured in simulations of quasi - static shear flows  @xcite displays only a mild increase is observed when @xmath166 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath63 was found to decrease rapidly as @xmath167 , which we believe is because the system approaches the isostatic limit  , but when the microscopic friction coefficient @xmath10 is small , many contacts are fully mobilized ( i.e.  the frictional force has its maximum value allowed by the coulomb criterion ) @xcite .",
    "these contacts contribute less to the number of degrees of freedom in the force network , since the tangential force component is fixed by the normal force component @xcite .",
    "therefore , these systems are less hyperstatic than one would think on the basis of the coordination number . ] .",
    "our main conclusion is thus that strongly hyperstatic packings of grains can support an amount of shear stress that is not very sensitive to friction or fabric anisotropy . for systems close to the isostatic limit , however , the dependence of the coordination number on any of these parameters has a more dramatic effect .",
    "another interesting perspective is that one can use an expansion of @xmath4 , as presented in this paper , to estimate the effective elastic moduli of the system , denoted by @xmath168 .",
    "it has been shown experimentally that these become highly anisotropic when a system is pre - sheared  @xcite .",
    "the response to a localized vertical force on the free surface of a granular bed was found not to propagate along the vertical , but along a direction that is tilted towards the major stress axis .",
    "this indicates a stiffening of contacts along the major axis that are responsible for the anisotropic elasticity . by fitting the experimentally measured stress profiles",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained the ratio @xmath169 of the young s moduli in the minor ( 1 ) and major ( 2 ) directions .",
    "this finding was remarkably insensitive to frictional properties and roughness of the grains .",
    "the stiffening of contacts can be explained through the nonlinear interaction between particles , which for frictionless hertzian contacts  @xcite in three dimensions is @xmath170 , where @xmath171 is the effective spring - constant of the contact .",
    "assuming that the displacements of the particles are affine  this is reasonable for the strongly hyperstatic packings considered in this paper  @xcite  one can estimate the elastic moduli as  @xcite   instead of @xmath172 introduces only a small error since these functions differ mainly around the minor principal axis where the integrand is small anyway . ]",

    "one already finds that @xmath174 , so that the experimentally observed ratio of about 0.67 is easily achieved for realistic values of @xmath63 .",

    "we show in section [ sec.frictionless ] that optimizing @xmath18 is equivalent to making the maximum of @xmath4 around the major principal axis as sharp as possible .",
    "it has been reported from numerical simulations of realistic systems that in practice this maximum is not very sharp and that typically the highest fourier contribution to @xmath175 is of order @xmath176  @xcite ( see also figure  [ fig1]b ) .",
    "this can be related to the coordination number as follows .",
    "suppose we wish to maximize the forces around the major principal axis , @xmath83 . on a typical grain",
    "this can be achieved by putting all stress on the contact closest to this angle . for a randomly oriented grain with @xmath177 ,",
    "the closest contact lies roughly in the range of @xmath178 around the principal direction .",
    "let us imagine that it were possible for a grain to have @xmath179 .",
    "now , the contacts closest to the major direction are spread within a much smaller range @xmath180 , so that much narrower widths of @xmath4 can be achieved .",
    "of course , the situations described above are very extreme because in reality all contacts will be involved in the force equilibrium . in any case , these simple examples illustrate that the coordination number introduces a natural scale for the width due to steric exclusion effects .",
    "if the polydispersity is small , only very few grains will have more than six neighbours , and the peaks and valleys in @xmath4 will therefore have a minimum width of approximately @xmath181 .",
    "this is why a description using only a few terms in a fourier expansion works , as was already clear from existing numerical results .",
    "in this appendix we analytically solve the linear problem of ( [ arbitrary ] ) . due to the symmetry of @xmath70",
    "we can write    @xmath182    comparing to ( [ fn1 ] ) , we find @xmath183 for odd @xmath54 , while @xmath184 for even @xmath54 .",
    "in particular , @xmath185 .",
    "the even derivatives can be written as    @xmath186    and since all sine terms evaluated at @xmath74 yield @xmath187 , we find for @xmath188    @xmath189    the linear problem of ( [ arbitrary ] ) can now be written in the form of a vandermonde matrix ,    @xmath190    with @xmath191 .",
    "the inverse @xmath192 of this matrix can be expressed explicitly in terms of lagrange polynomials as  @xcite    @xmath193    we are interested in the solution for @xmath194 , which for ( [ vdmonde ] ) simply reads    @xmath195    so that @xmath196 , ( [ taun ] ) .",
    "similarly , the other @xmath197 follow from    @xmath198",
    "we start from the expression for the deviatoric stress in terms of all parameters and fourier coefficients , equation ( [ tauanisfric ] ) , where we put @xmath162 because the tangential force components are zero .",
    "this reads @xmath199 the physical constraints on @xmath61 and @xmath81 are the same as for the isotropic case discussed in section  [ subsecfrictionless ] , but the optimization target is now given by ( [ tauanis ] ) , instead of the @xmath200 we had before .",
    "the constraints follow from @xmath70 and its second derivative being nonnegative at @xmath74 : @xmath201 the solution to this linear program is then found to be @xmath202 which corresponds to @xmath203 which is the result stated in equation ( [ taumaxanis ] ) .",
