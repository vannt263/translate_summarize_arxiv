    "in the last 20 years experimentalists have provided precise data for deuteron ( d ) breakup in the collision with a proton ( p ) at energies up to pion production threshold .",
    "their motivation has been to look for regions of three - body phase space where the results are sensitive to the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction and the need to include a three - nucleon ( 3n ) force . given that there are numerically exact 3n calculations that include a wide variety of nn force models , comparison between theoretical calculations and precise data sheds light on the quality of the nn interactions that have been proposed . since all nn interactions are fitted to nn elastic scattering data with equivalent @xmath0 precision , possible disagreements may reside in the off - shell nature of the chosen nn interaction or the need to add a 3n force .",
    "unfortunately this quest has been , in a few isolated cases such as the nucleon - deuteron analyzing power puzzle @xcite or the space - star anomaly @xcite , overshadowed by persistent discrepancies between data and theory that defy comprehension within the framework of non - relativistic quantum mechanics applied to three interacting nucleons alone .",
    "up to now very few breakup data exist involving four - nucleon reactions , though this system shows extra sensitivity to nn force models as some calculations have already demonstrated @xcite for specific spin observables and cross sections for elastic , charge exchange and transfer reactions .",
    "nevertheless exact numerical four - nucleon calculations for breakup amplitudes are still years away given the dimensionality of the problem and the complex structure of singularities above breakup .",
    "for elastic and transfer reactions driven by all possible n+3n initial states as well as d+d , converged solutions for all two - body reactions up to 30 mev beam energy @xcite are available . going to higher energies is formally not an obstacle but requires much more computer power to obtain fully converged results in terms of number of partial waves and grid points . on the other hand , the existing d+d breakup measurement @xcite performed at 130 mev deuteron beam energy",
    "has provided fully exclusive cross sections that are about three orders of magnitude smaller than for the p+d breakup at comparable energies .",
    "this is puzzling because one would expect a similar order of magnitude for p+d and d+d total breakup cross sections .",
    "according to recent calculations , albeit at the much lower energy of 10 mev @xcite , this is indeed the case .",
    "therefore , in order to provide the first estimate of d+d breakup cross sections at higher energies , we present here an approximate calculation based on the lowest - order term in the neumann series expansion of the alt , grassberger and sandhas ( ags ) equations @xcite for the breakup operator and called single - scattering approximation ( ssa ) .",
    "the ssa contains the breakup of one of the deuterons followed by the scattering of one nucleon from the other deuteron through the full 3n operator that sums up all orders of nn rescattering involving the corresponding three particles .",
    "this operator is obtained from the exact solution of the ags three - nucleon equations for the underlying force model being used .",
    "as demonstrated before @xcite , the same kind of approximation may be used to calculate d+d elastic scattering at high energies . in order to obtain a quantitative calibration of the d+d breakup cross sections , we provide ssa results also for d+d elastic scattering observables .",
    "ssa for three - cluster breakup calculations is expected to be reasonable near quasi - free scattering ( qfs ) kinematics at energies above 100 mev in the center - of - mass ( c.m . ) system .",
    "this conjecture is supported by the results for the equivalent approximation applied to p+d breakup where a comparison with the exact results that include nn rescattering to all orders is possible .    in section",
    "ii we present the theory for the breakup amplitudes using the first term in the neumann series expansion of the ags equations , and study the equivalent approximation applied to p+d breakup by comparing such results with those obtained from the exact solution of the corresponding 3n problem . in section",
    "iii we show the results for d+d elastic scattering and three - cluster breakup near the quasi - free scattering kinematics .",
    "conclusions come in section iv .",
    "we start with exact four - nucleon scattering equations and transition amplitudes , and then show how they are simplified under the single scattering approximation . treating nucleons as identical fermions in the isospin formalism , one has to consider only two two - cluster partitions , namely , @xmath1 and @xmath2 which in the notation for operators and wave - functions are abbreviated by 1 and 2 , respectively . in terms of four particles 1,2,3 , and 4",
    "they correspond to the clustering ( 12,3)4 and ( 12)(34 ) , respectively .",
    "the reactions initiated by the collisions of two deuterons are described by the four - nucleon transition operators @xmath3 obeying the symmetrized ags equations    [ eq : ags ] @xmath4    the pair potential @xmath5 enters the ags equations via the pair ( 12 ) transition matrix @xmath6 and via the 3 + 1 and 2 + 2 subsystem transition operators @xmath7 the dependence of all transition operators on the available energy @xmath8 , although not indicated in our notation , arises via the free resolvent @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the free hamiltonian . in the considered case @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the relative @xmath13 momentum , @xmath14 the average nucleon mass , and @xmath15 mev the energy of the deuteron bound state .",
    "the full antisymmetry that a system of four identical fermions must obey is ensured by the permutation operators @xmath16 of nucleons @xmath17 and @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , the basis states are antisymmetric under exchange of the two nucleons ( 12 ) while in the @xmath2 partition they are antisymmetric also under exchange of the two nucleons ( 34 ) .",
    "the three - cluster breakup operator for the @xmath2 collision is derived in ref .",
    "@xcite to be @xmath21    to get the reaction amplitudes the on - shell matrix elements of the above transition operators have to be calculated between the appropriate channel states .",
    "considering only the elastic @xmath13 scattering and three - cluster breakup , the respective channel states are @xmath22 with the faddeev component @xmath23 , and @xmath24 denotes the deuteron wave function , @xmath25 is the relative @xmath13 momentum , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are momenta for the relative motion in the three - cluster @xmath28 system , e.g. , @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the @xmath31 partition . the dependence on the discrete spin and isospin quantum numbers is suppressed in our notation .",

    "the absence of an inhomogeneous term in the equation makes possible the development of a simple approximation for d+d elastic scattering and three - cluster breakup that may work at higher energies under certain conditions . in the single - scattering approximation only the terms that are of first order in the subsystem transition operators @xmath36 are retained , resulting in the amplitudes    [ eq : ssa ] @xmath37 is required , which is the standard three - nucleon ags transition matrix .",
    "however , it needs to be calculated at off - shell momenta as we show below . given that @xmath38 , it is convenient to introduce the momentum - space matrix elements @xmath39 and the deuteron wave function @xmath40 ; they are operators in the spin - isospin space . with these definitions the first contribution to the symmetrized ssa elastic amplitude",
    "is calculated as @xmath41 with    [ eq : ssep ] @xmath42    the remaining three contributions are calculated analogously . in eq .",
    "the energy available for the three - nucleon subsystem @xmath43 runs from @xmath8 to @xmath44 , obviously indicating that @xmath45 is needed off - shell . on the other hand ,",
    "the final breakup channel state @xmath46 fulfills the on - shell condition @xmath47 , indicating that only half - shell elements of @xmath45 are needed .",
    "thus , the first term of the single - scattering breakup amplitude becomes @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 defined in eqs .  .",

    "thus , the reliability of the ssa should decrease with increasing energy of the final neutron .",
    "another necessary condition for the non - interacting neutron , and thereby also for the validity of the ssa , is a high enough relative @xmath56-@xmath57 and @xmath56-@xmath58 energy , implying also high enough energy for the initial beam and for the final deuteron and proton . at @xmath54",

    "such a difference is far too large even taking into account that our predictions are approximate . on the other hand , using ssa",
    "we predict the same order of magnitude for the differential cross section in nucleon - deuteron and deuteron - deuteron three - cluster breakup .",

    "e.g. , in the @xmath89 configuration , this sensitivity even exceeds the difference between ssa-1 and ssa-4 .",
    "nevertheless it is plausible that this extra sensitiveness may change when exact calculations are performed .",
    "in the present work we have calculated the spin - averaged fivefold differential cross section and deuteron analyzing powers for the three - cluster breakup in deuteron - deuteron collisions at 130 and 270 mev beam energy .",
    "although at this time we could not perform an exact four - nucleon calculation of the corresponding breakup amplitudes , we devised an approximation based on the first term in the neumann series expansion of the ags three - cluster breakup operator which is expected to be , qualitatively , a reasonable approximation near proton - deuteron quasifree scattering kinematic conditions .    in order to validate the method , we calculated proton - deuteron breakup at similar energies and compared with the results of an exact three - nucleon calculation .",
    "likewise we used the same single scattering approximation to calculate deuteron - deuteron elastic scattering at 232 mev where there is data for the differential cross section and analyzing powers .",
    "these auxiliary studies have shown that the ssa reproduces , if nothing else , the correct magnitude of the existing cross section data .",
    "although the deuteron beam energy of 130 mev seems to be not high enough for ssa to be reliable , we compared the ssa results for the three - cluster breakup with the experimental data measured at kvi @xcite .",
    "we found , at least in some configurations , a rough qualitative agreement for deuteron analyzing powers , but a factor of 1000 difference for the cross section .",
    "since we have provided convincing arguments that ssa should yield at least correct order of magnitude for total and differential cross sections , and that deuteron - deuteron and proton - deuteron breakup cross sections should be of comparable size , our work raises some serious concern on the correct normalization of the kvi data . on the contrary , new cracow data @xcite at 160 mev seems to be in line with our ssa results .",
    "further investigation on these issues needs to be pursued by both theory and experimental collaborations ."
