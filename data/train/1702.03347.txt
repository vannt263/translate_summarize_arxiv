    "<S> we theoretically study the dynamics of skyrmion crystals in electrically - insulating chiral magnets subjected to current - induced spin torques by adjacent metallic layers . </S>",
    "<S> we develop an elasticity theory that accounts for the gyrotropic force engendered by the non - trivial topology of the spin texture , tensions at the boundaries due to the exchange of linear and spin angular momentum with the metallic reservoirs , and dissipation in the bulk of the film . </S>",
    "<S> a steady translation of the skyrmion crystal is triggered by the current - induced tensions and subsequently sustained by dissipative forces , generating an electromotive force on itinerant spins in the metals . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon should be revealed as a negative drag in an open two - terminal geometry , or equivalently , as a positive magnetoresistance when the terminals are connected in parallel . </S>",
    "<S> we propose non - local transport measurements with these salient features as a tool to characterize the phase diagram of insulating chiral magnets .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction_.topological solitons in magnetic materials are non - linear excitations with a well - defined energy that behave as particles . their dynamics can be manipulated by different means , like spin - polarized currents@xcite or thermal gradients.@xcite one example of these excitations are magnetic skyrmions , continuous spin textures characterized by an integer charge@xcite@xmath0 where @xmath1 is a unit vector along the local spin density , @xmath2 . this topological charge labels the number of times that the local order parameter wraps the unit sphere in a planar ferromagnet . in the simplest approximation </S>",
    "<S> , a rigid skyrmion behaves as a massless particle subjected to a magnus or gyrotropic force proportional to @xmath3.@xcite this force deflects the trajectory with respect to the direction of the driving force , leading to the so - called skyrmion hall effect.@xcite    bogdanov and others@xcite predicted the existence of a crystalline phase in which the skyrmions are spontaneously arranged in a two - dimensional lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this phase , stabilized by relativistic interactions in the presence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the magnet , can be visualized as the close packing of individual skyrmions forming a triangular lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the skyrmion crystal has been observed in various systems , ranging from itinerant chiral magnets like mnsi@xcite or fege@xcite to multiferroic insulating materials like cu@xmath4oseo@xmath5.@xcite        in this letter , we study the dynamics of skyrmion crystals in the steady - flow - motion regime . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on electrically - insulating thin films , in which the forces are induced by spin - transfer torques@xcite at the interface with diffusive metals . </S>",
    "<S> our theory provides the basic ingredients for a full - electrical measurement of the skyrmion dynamics that can be used as an alternative to neutron scattering@xcite and electron microscopy@xcite studies . </S>",
    "<S> our main findings can be summarized as follows : in the elastic regime with the account of dissipative forces , the equation of motion for the displacements of the skyrmions @xmath6 within the plane of the magnet reads @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the saturated spin density , @xmath9 is the area of the unit - cell , @xmath10 is the gilbert damping constant and @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the lam coefficients characterizing the elastic response of the skyrmion crystal </S>",
    "<S> . the second term in the left hand of this equation corresponds to the gyrotropic force arising from the non - trivial topology of the spin texture . </S>",
    "<S> the current - induced torques at the interface with a metal , provided a strong exchange interaction by proximity with the magnet , work in favor of the nucleation of skyrmions,@xcite applying then a tension of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the current density in the adjacent metal . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensionless parameter @xmath15 and the length @xmath16 measure the strength and spatial extension of the proximity effect . </S>",
    "<S> reciprocally , the annihilation of skyrmions at the boundaries generates an electromotive force@xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the velocity of skyrmions at the interface . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneously , the generation of a spin current in the metal dissipates energy and angular momentum from the magnet , giving rise to a viscous tension at the interface , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the resistivity of the metal .    </S>",
    "<S> these equations along with ohm s law in the metals constitute the basic elements of the self - consistent magneto - electric dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> equipped with this formalism , we study the response of two metallic layers connected by an electrically - insulating chiral magnet in the skyrmion - crystal phase , as illustrated in fig .  [ </S>",

    "<S> we consider first an open geometry , in which a longitudinal spin - transfer tension is applied by an electrical current in one of the terminals . in the absence of dissipation ( panel  a ) the skyrmion crystal moves perpendicular to the tension due to the gyrotropic force , in parallel to the current . </S>",
    "<S> there is no induced current in the second terminal in that case . in the presence of dissipation , however , viscous forces ( panel b ) generate a longitudinal motion , which pumps an electrical current in the right terminal . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is characterized by a dimensionless drag coefficient of the form@xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the effective _ interfacial _ and _ bulk _ conductances , @xmath24 here @xmath25 can be interpreted as the effective viscosity for skyrmions with @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the drag signal decays algebraically with the distance between contacts , @xmath27 , reflecting the conservation of the skyrmion charge . </S>",

    "<S> the aim of the following discussion is to emphasize the close relation between the linear momentum and the non - trivial topology of the spin texture.@xcite this allows to define the stress tensor unambiguously and construct the equilibrium thermodynamics from general symmetry arguments .    </S>",

    "<S> the collective coordinates @xmath35 are promoted to a field @xmath36 describing the displacements of the skyrmions with respect to their equilibrium positions in the lattice . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath15 measures the spin polarization of the current in the adjacent metal . </S>",
    "<S> this torque arises form the exchange of linear momentum between the metal and the magnet and therefore applies a force on the skyrmion crystal . </S>",
    "<S> this tension can be computed from the work - power exerted by the spin - transfer torque , @xmath66 , integrated over the length @xmath16 . in our collective field </S>",
    "<S> approach we have @xmath67 , and the resulting expression can be related to the skyrmion charge density since @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the expression in eq .   by identifying the power - work with @xmath69 .    </S>",
    "<S> reciprocally , the skyrmion dynamics at the interface induces an electromotive force in the metal of the form@xcite@xmath70 eq .   </S>",

    "<S> this pumped force results from the spin - dependent electric field generated in the metal due to the accumulation of berry phases@xcite by itinerant spins adiabatically following the exchange field . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as long as the adiabatic approximation holds and regardless the spin polarization of the electrical current , a spin current is also generated in the metal,@xmath71 the depletion of spin angular momentum exerts a dissipative torque on the magnetization . in the absence of spin relaxation </S>",

    "<S> we assume that the magnetic field stabilizing the skyrmion - crystal phase points in the positive @xmath49-axis , therefore @xmath73 ; we also assume translational invariance along the interface . in the steady state </S>",
    "<S> , the displacement field reads in general as @xmath74 ; the velocities are uniform , i.e. , the stress in the steady state does not depend on time . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk dynamics expressed in eq .   relates the skyrmion velocities with the internal stress . </S>",
