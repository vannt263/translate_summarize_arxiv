    "a complex - valued harmonic function @xmath0 , defined on the unit disk @xmath1 , is called a _ harmonic mapping _ if the coordinate function @xmath2 and @xmath3 are real harmonic , and it maps @xmath1 univalently onto a domain @xmath4 . note that it is not required that the real part and the imaginary part of @xmath5 are harmonic conjugate functions , i.e. , satisfy the cauchy - riemann equations . in 1984 ,",
    "clunie and sheil - small @xcite showed that many classical results for conformal mappings have natural analogues for harmonic mappings , and hence they can be regarded as a natural generalization of conformal mappings .",
    "since then , this class of mappings has attracted considerable interest in complex analysis , see e.g. @xcite .    an important method for studying geometric properties of harmonic mappings",
    "is called harmonic shearing . since its introduction in @xcite",
    ", it has been researched by many authors .",
    "for example , greiner @xcite studied harmonic shears of conformal mappings from the unit disk onto infinite strips and other domains .",
    "shearing of conformal mappings from the unit disk onto regular polygonal domains have been studied in the paper by driver and duren @xcite , and by the author with ponnusamy and rasila @xcite .",
    "the shear construction makes use of a conformal mapping @xmath6 and an analytic dilatation @xmath7 . for required assumptions for the dilatation @xmath7 ,",
    "see section [ section : harmonic - mapping ] .",
    "an applet @xcite for exploring harmonic shears with user defined conformal mappings is written by rolf and examples are given in @xcite . however , no accuracy tests against analytic form have been given in @xcite .",
    "note that , the applet requires an analytic expression for the conformal mapping .    in this paper ,",
    "the schwarz - christoffel toolbox by driscoll @xcite is used to provide a conformal mapping for the presented numerical method for harmonic shear .",
    "the toolbox computes a conformal mapping from the unit disk @xmath1 onto a polygonal domain .",
    "see @xcite for details for the construction of a conformal mapping .    in principle ,",
    "other methods can be used to obtain conformal mappings as well .",
    "an example of a numerical method , that does not involve the schwarz - christoffel formula , is the zipper algorithm of marshall @xcite .",
    "a method involving the harmonic conjugate function is presented in @xcite .",
    "an algorithm using the harmonic conjugate function and properties of quadrilateral is given by the author in a joint work with hakula and rasila @xcite .",
    "the algorithm is based on properties of the conformal modulus originating on the theory of quasiconformal mappings @xcite .",
    "the method is suitable for simply and doubly connected domains , which may have curved boundaries and even cusps .",
    "the implementation of the algorithm is based on the @xmath8-fem from @xcite .",
    "an important application of harmonic mappings is related to minimal surfaces .",

    "suppose that @xmath10 for some analytic function @xmath11 in the unit disk @xmath1",
    ". then the corresponding minimal surface has the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 the approach taken in this paper is based on the weierstrass - enneper representation .",
    "for further information about the relation between harmonic mappings and minimal surfaces can be found from @xcite .",
    "minimal surfaces are closely related to many interesting phenomena in natural science and engineering , from mathematical models of soap bubble surfaces @xcite , to topics in molecular engineering @xcite , and tensile structures @xcite . for a further reading on minimal surfaces and their applications",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "the matlab visualisations of harmonic mappings are kept as close to the original images ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) as possible for easier comparison . besides given illustrations",
    ", one can enhance the visualisations , e.g. , by using phase portrait method @xcite or by using domain coloring method @xcite .",
    "a harmonic mapping in @xmath1 has a canonical presentation @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are analytic in @xmath1 and @xmath17 . a harmonic mapping @xmath14 is called _ sense - preserving _ if the jacobian @xmath18 is positive in @xmath1 .",
    "then @xmath5 has an _ analytic dilatation _",
    "@xmath19 such that @xmath20 for @xmath21 . for basic properties of harmonic mappings ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "a domain @xmath4 is said to be _ convex in the horizontal direction _",
    "( chd ) if its intersection with each horizontal line is connected ( or empty ) .",
    "a univalent harmonic mapping is called a chd mapping if its range is a chd domain .",
    "construction of a harmonic mapping @xmath5 with prescribed dilatation @xmath7 can be done by the _ shear construction _ devised by clunie and sheil - small @xcite . for reader",
    "s convenience , we recall the construction along with its basic properties .",
    "let @xmath22 be a harmonic and locally univalent in the unit disk @xmath1 .",

    "the key idea behind the gauss quadrature is to choose the interpolation nodes in order to maximize the degree of exactness of the quadrature rule . in the gauss quadrature",
    "one will consider integrals of the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a quadrature rule corresponding to the weight function @xmath33 . in @xcite ,",
    "golub and welsch gave algorithms to the gauss quadrature for different weight functions .",
    "more in - depth discussion of the gauss quadrature can be found , e.g. , in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.3 ) .    in our case , we have a singularity of the form @xmath34 caused by the dilatation .",
    "for some choices of dilatation , we can use the appropriate gauss quadrature to deal with the singularity .",
    "however , in this article , we shall use the gauss - kronrod quadrature , which is also build in matlab .",
    "the gauss - kronrod quadrature is a generalization of a pure gaussian quadrature and the method adds additional nodes to the gauss rule with a way to control the error .",
    "it should also be noted that , the gauss - kronrod quadrature does not take possible singularities into account .",
    "for futher discussion of the gauss - kronrod quadrature , see @xcite .",
    "numerical experiments are divided into two meshing of the unit disk .",
    "for the first part , the following mesh of the form @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 , is used .",
    "the second mesh is refined near the boundary of the unit disk , where @xmath38 and meshing for the angle is the same as in the first mesh .",
    "validation of the numerical scheme is run against the analytic representation of the harmonic mappings .",
    "all conformal mappings obtained by the sc toolbox are computed with the precision setting : ` precision = 1e-14 ` .",
    "note that , by using , one have two sources of errors .",
    "the first one comes from the integral presentation of @xmath15 and the second source of error comes from the conformal mapping @xmath6 itself .    in the unit disk ,",
    "the comparison of the harmonic mapping is done by using the following test function @xmath39 where @xmath5 is the analytic expression of the harmonic mapping and @xmath40 is given by the quadrature .",
    "note that , by , we may write the test function as follows @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are obtained by the gauss - kronrod quadrature and the sc toolbox , respectively .",
    "in this section , we consider polygonal examples .",
    "let the conformal mapping be ( see @xcite ) @xmath44 which maps the unit disk @xmath1 onto a regular @xmath45-gon .",
    "in @xcite , driver and duren discussed the harmonic shear of @xmath6 with the dilatation @xmath46 .",
    "they studied other dilatation choices as well .",
    "the author considered the dilatation @xmath47 in a joint work with ponnusamy and rasila @xcite .      in @xcite , it was shown that for the dilatation @xmath48 , the harmonic shear of @xmath6 is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 if the gaussian hypergeometric function .",
    "the function is defined as follows @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the pochhammer symbol . for @xmath53 ,",
    "this can also be written as the euler integral @xmath54    in case of @xmath55 , the harmonic shear is shown , in @xcite , to be @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the first appell hypergeometric function @xcite , which is defined by @xmath58 appell hypergeometric functions can be given by euler s integral as follows @xcite : @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "let @xmath55 , @xmath61 . the reason we chose this dilatation is that , in we have eight singularities and it reveals the accuracy of our algorithm and as well as the accuracy of the sc toolbox . in figure [ fig : sc - poly4-dila - z8 ] , we have reproduced the figures from @xcite and numerically computed images using the presented algorithm .",
    "+   +    in figure [ fig : sc - poly - dila - z8-error - f ] , we have the error of the test function of the harmonic shear @xmath5 given in the logarithmic scale ( with base 10 ) .",
    "note that , the error is given in the pre - image form , so that the figure can be shown in a more compact manner .",
    "the error corresponding to the second mesh can be given in polar coordinates as well , but the readability of the figure would be lost due to the poor resolution . therefore , the error is given in cartesian coordinates .",
    "white areas in illustrations correspond to the loss of accuracy at singularities due to roots of the @xmath62 . in the second mesh , near the boundary",
