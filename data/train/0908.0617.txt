    "the magnitude of @xmath2 can be taken as a measure for the degree of cooperativity between the motors . the more cooperative the motors are , the more persistent is the movement and the longer are the periods of unidirectional transport .",

    "some years ago @xcite .",
    "a slightly modified version of this model is illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the model considers the one - dimensional motion of a group of @xmath3 point particles ( representing the motors ) connected ( mechanically coupled ) to a rigid rod with equal spacing @xmath4 .",
    "the cytoskeletal track is represented by a periodic saw - tooth potential , @xmath5 , with period @xmath6 and height @xmath7 .",
    "the model requires that @xmath4 is larger than and incommensurate with @xmath6 .",
    "the motors are identical and walk on a track which is globally a - polar and , thus , does not permit net transport to the right or left over large time scales .",
    "the temporal direction of motion is determined by the net force generated by all the motors .",
    "the local polarity of the track is represented by an additional force of size @xmath8 ( denoted by a horizontal arrow in each periodic unit in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) which , within each unit of the periodic potential , points to the right or to the left .",
    "the globally a - polar nature of the track is ensured by requiring that the sum of these random forces vanishes .",
    "the instantaneous force between the track and the motors is given by the sum of all the forces acting on the individual motors : @xmath9\\cdot c_i(t ) , \\label{eq : ftot}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the coordinate of the @xmath11-th motor .",
    "the two terms in the square brackets represent the forces due to the symmetric saw - tooth potential and the additional random local forces acting in each periodic unit .",
    "the function @xmath12 takes two possible values , 0 or 1 , depending on whether the motor @xmath11 is detached from or attached to the track , respectively , at time @xmath13 .",
    "the motors change their binding states ( 0 - detached ; 1 - attached ) independently of each other , according to the following rules : we define an interval of size @xmath14 centered around the potential minima ( the gray shaded area in fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "if located in one of these regions , an attached motor may become detached ( @xmath15 ) with a probability per unit time @xmath16 .",
    "conversely , a detached motor may attach to the track ( @xmath17 ) with transition rate @xmath18 only if located outside this region of size @xmath19 .    at each instance",
    ", the group velocity of the motors is proportional to the total force exerted by the motors ( eq .  [ eq : ftot ] ) @xmath20 where the friction coefficient , @xmath21 , depends mainly on motors attached to the track and is , therefore , taken proportional to the number of connected motors , @xmath22 at time @xmath13 : @xmath23 . because the track is globally a - polar , it is clear that the motors exhibit `` back and forth '' motion with vanishing mean velocity and displacement .",
    "the characteristic time of movement in each direction , @xmath2 , may nevertheless be macroscopically large .",
    "the origin of this feature ( which reflects the cooperative character of the motors action ) can be explained as follows : the stochastic equations of motion of our model system have two identical ( except for sign reversal ) steady state solutions corresponding to right and left motion of the mechanically coupled motors .",
    "each of these solutions is characterized by @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) connected motors .",
    "the connected motors are partitioned to @xmath26 and @xmath27 motors that , respectively , support and object the motion .",
    "let us define the excess number of motors working in the direction of the motion as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 will be termed the `` bias parameter '' .",
    "notice that @xmath30 and @xmath29 denote the averages of quantities ( which we , respectively , denote by @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) whose values fluctuate in time due to the stochastic binding and unbinding of motors . to switch the direction of motion ,",

    "[ eq : taurevexp ] was recently tested using a motility assay in which myosin ii motors drive the motion of globally a - polar actin bundles @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the predicted exponential dependence of @xmath2 on the number of working motors , the experimentally measured reversal times showed no dependence on @xmath3 .",
    "the apparent disagreement between the theoretical model and the experimental results can be reconciled by noting that eq .",
    "[ eq : taurevexp ] describes exponential growth of @xmath37 with @xmath3 only when @xmath30 and @xmath29 are themselves independent of @xmath3 .",
    "this is indeed the case in the original model presented by badoual _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , where both the on ( @xmath18 ) and off ( @xmath16 ) rates do not depend on @xmath3 . in ref .",
    "@xcite we introduced a slightly modified version of badoual s model , which to a large extent explains the experimentally observed independence of @xmath2 on @xmath3 .",
    "we argued that the origin of this behavior can be attributed to the tension developed in the actin track due to the action of the attached myosin ii motors .",
    "an increase in the number of attached motors leads to an increase in the mechanical load which , in turn , leads to an increase in the detachment rate of the motors , as already suggested in models of muscle contraction @xcite .",
    "but unlike most previous studies where the myosin conformational energy was calculated , in ref .",
    "@xcite we considered the elastic energy stored in the actin track . within a mean field approximation , this energy scales as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the effective spring constant of the track and @xmath40 is the total force exerted by the motors ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : totalforce ] ) .",
    "the total force is the sum of @xmath41 random forces working in opposite directions .",
    "therefore , the mean force @xmath42 , while @xmath43 scales linearly with @xmath41 .",
    "the spring constant is inversely proportional to the length of the track , i.e. to the size of the system and to the total number of motors @xmath3 .",
    "we thus conclude that the mean elastic energy of the actin scales like @xmath44 , which means that the detachment of a motor ( @xmath45 ) leads , on average , to an energy gain @xmath46 ( @xmath47 is some dimensionless number ) .",
    "this effect can be incorporated within the model by introducing an additional off rate , @xmath48 , outside the gray shaded area in fig .  1 ( i.e. , around the potential maxima ) .",
    "thus , in the modified model , the on and off rates within each unit cell ( @xmath49 ) of the periodic potential are given by @xmath50 and @xmath51 the dependence of @xmath52 on @xmath3 is another , indirect , manifestation of cooperativity between the motors which is mediated through the forces that the motors jointly exert on the actin track .",
    "notice , however , that the cooperative action of the motors does not lead ( within the modified model ) to correlations between attachment and detachment events of different motors .",
    "moreover , the attachment / detachment rates do not depend on the number of connected motors and , thus , are fixed over time . in ref",

    "@xcite by noting that in the absence of an elastic load , the probability of such an event is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the complementary probability that the attached motor will execute the step .",
    "the constant @xmath47 depends on the effective elastic spring constant of the basic actin unit ( monomer ) as well as on the magnitude of the forces that the motors typically apply on the track ( see eq .  5 in ref .",

    "[ eq : taurevexp ] and indicated by the straight line in fig .  2b , for @xmath67 the mean reversal time @xmath68 exhibits a very strong exponential dependence on @xmath3 .",
    "because of this very rapid increase of @xmath69 with @xmath3 , the reversal times ( in the @xmath67 case ) could not be accurately measured for @xmath70 .",
    "based on the exponential fit ( solid line in fig .",
    "2b ) , we estimate that for @xmath71 the mean reversal time will be of the order of a few hours .",
    "in contrast , the calculated @xmath72 corresponding to @xmath61 show a non - monotonic dependence on @xmath3 .",
    "the computed @xmath72 are much smaller in this case , and fall below 1 minute for all values of @xmath3 . in ref .",

    "our simulations reveal surprisingly large variations in the @xmath37 values between random tracks of similar size ( see error bars in fig .  [",
    "fig:2]b ) .",
    "the origin of these variations lies in the fact that the spacing between motors is larger than the periodicity of the ratchet potential ( @xmath74 ) and , thus , only @xmath3 out of @xmath63 unit cells are `` occupied '' with motors ( which may be either connected or disconnected ) at each instance . thus , although the track is perfectly a - polar and contains an equal number of cells with random forces pointing in both directions , the subset of occupied cells may have net polarity which constantly changes with time as the motors move collectively along the track .",
    "the direction of the net polarity of the occupied cells is also the instantaneous preferred direction of motion .",
    "therefore , the temporal variations in the net polarity must be correlated with the changes in the directionality of the motion .",
    "we thus expect tracks on which the net polarity changes more frequently to have smaller @xmath2 .",
    "the effect of net polarity fluctuations does not occur when the motion takes place on periodic a - polar tracks , because in this case the equally spaced motors occupy equal number of cells with left- and right - pointing random forces .",
    "therefore , the reversal times on periodic a - polar tracks are expected to be ( i ) independent of the periodicity of the track , and ( ii ) larger than the reversal time on random a - polar tracks .",
    "these predictions are fully corroborated by the results from simulations with two very distinct periodic tracks - one with period 2 ( i.e. , where the local random force changes its sign every unit cell ) and one with period @xmath75 ( i.e. , when the track is divided into two equal domains of opposite polarities ) .",
    "the results from these two sets of simulations are denoted by triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]b .",
    "the reversal times of both periodic tracks are nearly indistinguishable from each other ( the differences between them are smaller than the size of the symbols ) and are larger than the reversal times measured for all the random tracks of similar size .",
    "what happens when the simulated track is not perfectly a - polar and the number unit cells in which the random force is pointing in one direction is slightly larger than in the opposite direction ?",
    "obviously , the nature of motion is expected to gradually change from bidirectional to unidirectional . in order to investigate this transition between two types of dynamics ,",
    "we simulated the dynamics of motors on tracks in which the fraction of random forces pointing in one direction , @xmath76 , is slightly larger than 0.5 . in the simulations , we fixed the number of motors to @xmath77 and varied the difference @xmath78 between the fractions of random forces pointing in the favored and disfavored directions .",
    "for each track , the simulation data was analyzed in a manner similar to that described above for a - polar tracks , i.e. , by fitting the pdf of time intervals of unidirectional motion to an exponential function .",
    "there is one notable difference , however , between the analysis of the results for a - polar and for slightly polar tracks . in the latter case , two pdfs , one corresponding for each direction of motion ,",
    "must be generated with different characteristic reversal times .",
    "the motion in the preferred direction is characterized by the larger reversal time , @xmath79 , which increases with @xmath80 .",
    "conversely , the smaller reversal time , @xmath81 , corresponding to the motion in the opposite unpreferred direction decreases with @xmath80 .",
    "these observations are summarized in figs .",
    "[ fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , the pdfs corresponding to tracks with @xmath80 values varying from 0 to 0.05 are shown . in the a - polar case @xmath82 ,",
    "the two pdfs coincide with each others , and the velocity histogram ( see inset ) is bimodal . as @xmath80 increases , the two pdfs become increasingly different - the one corresponding to the preferred direction of motion becomes flatter ( due to the increase in @xmath83 ) , while the other one gets more peaked at the origin ( as a result of the decrease in @xmath84 ) .",
    "the fact that the motors spend larger time intervals moving in one direction is also reflected in the corresponding velocity histograms which become less and less symmetric .",
    "the results presented in fig.[fig:3 ] are obtained from simulations of six different track realizations , one for each different value of @xmath80 .",
    "the mean reversal times , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , obtained by averaging the reversal times computed for 8 track realizations for each value of @xmath80 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] . for @xmath87 , @xmath88 . for even larger values of @xmath80 ,",
    "the dynamics are essentially unidirectional , as intervals of motion in the unpreferred direction become very rare and short .",
    "we , thus , conclude that bidirectional motion can be observed only on a - polar or slightly polar tracks .",
    "this conclusion is directly related to the cooperativity of the motors which causes persistent motion that can not be easily reversed .",
    "in the following section we use mean field master equations to analyze the bidirectional motion exhibited by our computational model .",
    "the mean field approach corresponds to the limit @xmath89 where one can introduce the probability densities @xmath90 and @xmath91 of finding a motor in the attached or detached state , respectively , at position @xmath92 within the unit cell of the periodic potential .",

    "we also notice that when the off rate @xmath113 , @xmath109 drops very rapidly ( exponentially ) to near zero in the detachment interval . when the attachment rates @xmath114 , @xmath109 increases exponentially fast for @xmath115 and rapidly reaches the maximum possible value @xmath116 .",

    "[ fig:6]b for several different values of @xmath3 ( @xmath77 - solid line , @xmath148 - dashed line , @xmath149 - thick solid line ) .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , the detachment rate @xmath16 in our simulations is so large that the central detachment interval of the unit cell ( @xmath111 ) is completely depleted of motors .",
    "increasing @xmath3 leads to a decrease in the effective attachment rate around the potential maximum , which reduces both the number of motors supporting ( @xmath150 ) and objecting ( @xmath151 ) the motion and leads to the non - monotonic dependence of @xmath152 on @xmath3 .",
    "the fitting value of @xmath145 msec is very close to @xmath153 msec , which is the traveling time of the motors within a unit cell of the potential ( once we set @xmath144 nm / sec ) and , therefore , is also the characteristic time scale at which the motors change their `` states '' ( detached , connected and supporting the motion , connected and objecting the motion ) .",
    "the remarkable agreement between the analytical and simulation results for @xmath2 should not , however , be allowed to obscure the fact that eq .",
    "[ eq : taurevexp2 ] is based on a mean field approximation which , in principle , is not suitable for the calculating the probabilities of rare fluctuation events ( such as velocity reversals in cooperative bidirectional movement ) .",
    "the agreement is achieved with effective velocity ( @xmath144 nm / sec ) which is significantly smaller than the typical velocity measured in the simulations ( @xmath142 nm / sec ) .",
    "therefore , one should not expect the steady state probability density @xmath90 plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:6]b to perfectly match the simulations data .",
    "we use a two - state ratchet model to study the cooperative bidirectional motion of myosin ii motors on actin tracks with randomly alternating polarities .",
    "our model is an extension of a model previously proposed by badoual _",
    "_ to explain the macroscopically large reversal times measured in motility assays @xcite .",
    "these time scales of velocity reversals are orders of magnitude longer than the microscopic typical stepping times of individual motors and can be understood as a result of collective effects in many - motor systems .",
    "the ratchet model that we use assumes that the motors are coupled mechanically but act independently , i.e. , their binding to and unbinding from the cytoskeletal track are statistically uncorrelated .",
    "these assumptions lead to a predicted exponential increase of @xmath2 with @xmath3 , the number of motors .",
    "motivated by recent experiments which exhibit no such dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath3 @xcite , we introduced a modified version of badoual s model which accounts for an additional cooperative effect of the molecular motors and which eliminates the exponential increase of @xmath2 with @xmath3 .",
    "this additional collective effect arises from the forces that the motors jointly exert on the actin and the associated elastic energy which ( within a mean field approximation ) scales as @xmath154 ( where @xmath155 is the number of attached motors ) .",
    "this scaling relationship implies that the typical energy released when a motor is detaching from the track increases linearly with @xmath3 and , therefore , the detachment rate in many - motor systems should be larger than the detachment rate of individual motors .",
    "we show , both computationally and analytically , that when this effect is taken into account and the detachment rate is properly redefined , the characteristic reversal time does not diverge for large @xmath3 .",
    "instead , @xmath2 exhibits a much weaker dependence on @xmath3 and reaches a maximum at intermediate values of @xmath3 .    while our model definitely improves the agreement with the experimental results ( compared to the original model ) , further improvement is needed in order to eliminate the non - monotonic dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath3 .",
    "one step in this direction may be to consider other forms of the off - rate @xmath156 which are based on more accurate evaluations of the actin elastic energy . in the present work",
    ", our analysis is based on a mean field approximation which makes the calculation tractable by assuming that the detachment rate depends only on @xmath3 ( the total number of motors ) , but not on the instantaneous number of attached motors and their locations along the cytoskeletal track .",
    "a full statistical mechanical treatment is feasible only for small systems , which we plan to report in a future publication . as a final remark here",
    "we note that the mean field approximation probably leads to over - estimation of the effect of the `` track - mediated '' elastic interactions on the reversal times ( which may explain the decrease in @xmath2 for large @xmath3 )",
    ". in a non - mean - field calculation the motors which release higher energy will detach at higher rates , and the detachment of these `` energetic '' motors will lead to the release of much of the elastic energy stored in the actin track .",
    "by contrast , in the mean field approximation the contribution of all the connected motors to the energy is the same . therefore . within the mean - field approximation",
    ", a larger number of motors must be disconnected at a higher frequency , which increases the `` stochastic noise '' in the system that reduced @xmath2 .",
