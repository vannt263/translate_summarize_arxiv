    "to understand processes spreading on a static network @xmath2 , researchers frequently investigate how @xmath2 behaves under percolation .",
    "percolation comes in many flavors , and the information we gain depends on which variety we choose . most frequently , we study bond or site percolation , but researchers have also found that @xmath0-core percolation , bootstrap percolation , the generalized epidemic process , and the watts threshold model ( wtm ) provide valuable insights  @xcite .",
    "these processes are closely related , and indeed similar mathematical approaches have been used to study several of these processes  @xcite .",
    "our main result is that all of these ( and some related ) processes can be derived as special cases of the wtm , and in fact several of these are completely equivalent to the wtm .",
    "much of the motivation for studying percolation processes comes from trying to understand spreading processes in networks .",
    "if we consider systems in which nodes change status in response to the status of their neighbors , and the potential path of statuses they can have is acyclic ( that is they can never return to a previous status ) , then many variants of percolation can be applied .",
    "this is commonly used for sir disease , in which an individual can be infected by an infected neighbor . however",
    ", much recent work has focused on the spread of `` social contagion '' or `` complex contagions ''  @xcite in which multiple transmissions may be required in order to cause `` infection '' .",
    "sometimes this is presented as assigning each node a threshold @xmath3 such that @xmath4 becomes infected once @xmath3 neighbors are `` infected '' .",
    "other times this is presented as a reduction ( or increase ) in the probability that a neighbor will transmit as an individual encounters more infected individuals .",
    "this models the idea that after hearing seemingly independent `` confirmation '' of a rumor people may be more likely to believe and spread it , or after seeing multiple people engaging buying a product someone is more likely to perceive a consensus and buy the product as well .",
    "some experimental evidence of this has been found  @xcite .",
    "we briefly review the processes we will study : in bond percolation , some edges are independently selected with uniform probability @xmath5 to be retained while the remaining edges are deleted ( with probability @xmath6 ) .",
    "similarly in site percolation , some nodes are randomly selected with probability @xmath5 and the remaining nodes are deleted . typically our interest is in identifying the nodes in the connected components of the residual network , and whether a `` giant '' component exists ( that is a component whose size is proportional to the network size in the infinite network limit ) .    _",
    "bond percolation _ and _ site percolation _ often show up in the study of sir disease spread where a single transmission suffices to cause infection  @xcite .",
    "there is an exact equivalence between the spread of an sir disese and bond percolation , and so much has been learned about the threshold , scaling properties , and dynamics of an sir disease by studying the corresponding percolation odel .",
    "this percolation equivalence is based on the fact that an edge either exists or does not in percolation , while in disease spread if the edge transmits , the receiving node becomes infected .    in _",
    "@xmath0-core percolation _ all nodes with degree less than some specified @xmath0 are removed .",
    "this removal may reduce some nodes degrees below @xmath0 .",
    "if so , these are removed .",
    "this `` pruning '' process repeats until reaching a state in which all nodes have degree at least @xmath0 .",
    "this remaining network is called the `` @xmath0-core '' of the network . it is seen to have hybrid phase transitions , with a square root - type scaling on one side of a transition followed by a discontinuous jump  @xcite . in a variant ,",
    "`` heterogeneous @xmath0-core '' percolation  @xcite , each node is assigned its own threshold value and deleted if its degree goes below the threshold .",
    "we note that many authors have used the term `` bootstrap percolation '' to denote @xmath0-core percolation , and indeed this appears to be the original term  @xcite , but we reserve `` bootstrap percolation '' for a closely related dual process .",
    "the @xmath0-core has been applied to many problems , including understanding failure of a physical system under strain  @xcite , network visualization  @xcite , identification of the component of a network responsible for establishing a disease  @xcite , and more generally for understanding the structure of a network  @xcite .    in _ bootstrap percolation _",
    "( introduced in  @xcite where it is called `` diffusion percolation '' ) a collection of nodes is initially `` activated '' .",
    "then any inactive node with at least @xmath7 active neighbors becomes active .",
    "the process repeats until all remaining inactive nodes have fewer than @xmath7 active neighbors .",
    "it was initially introduced to model the spread of a water - filled crack in a rock .",
    "it has received considerable study on lattices  @xcite , and its behavior in large random networks has been the subject of some more recent analysis  @xcite . like @xmath0-core percolation",
    "it is seen to have a hybrid phase transition .",
    "we introduce a natural generalization analogous to heterogeneous @xmath0-core percolation in which each node is assigned its own threshold .",
    "this `` heterogeneous bootstrap percolation '' does not appear to have been studied previously .    in the _ generalized epidemic process _",
    "( gep )  @xcite , we think of an infection spreading through the network . if a node has a single infected neighbor , its probability of becoming infected is @xmath8 . if it escapes infection , but a second neighbor becomes infected , then its probability of becoming infected is @xmath9 .",
    "this repeats and the probability of successful transmission on the @xmath7-th neighbor s infection is @xmath10 . if @xmath11 for all @xmath7 , then this is the network version of the classical reed - frost model  @xcite for a susceptible - infected - recovered disease  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath10 decreases as @xmath7 increases , this could model decreasing susceptibility due to an improved immune response as exposures accumulate , or it could simply represent pre - existing heterogeneities in susceptibility that are revealed as the number of exposures increases .",
    "an increasing @xmath10 would model some synergistic or cumulative effect of exposures as seen in `` complex contagions ''  @xcite .",
    "for comparison with other models , we allow @xmath10 to depend on @xmath12 , the degree of node @xmath4 .    in the _ wtm _",
    "@xcite , each node @xmath4 is assigned an individual threshold @xmath3 which we assume is assigned to @xmath4 independently at random , with a probability that may depend on its degree @xmath12 .",
    "the probability node @xmath4 has a given @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 .",
    "a node begins either active or inactive .",
    "if an inactive node @xmath4 has at least @xmath3 active neighbors then it becomes active .",
    "we assume that the initially active nodes may be chosen independently at random ( which can be modelled by having @xmath15 for some @xmath16 ) , or they may be chosen by some other rule , in which case we treat the set of initially active nodes as an input to the algorithm . often a common threshold @xmath17 is chosen so @xmath18 or a common fraction @xmath19 is chosen so @xmath20 .",
    "as described above , this is frequently used to model social contagions . in  @xcite",
    "it was conjectured that for a global cascade to occur from an infinitesimally small initial proportion active , a giant component of nodes with @xmath21 would need to exist .",
    "this is true in random configuration model networks , but false in random clustered networks  @xcite . as with bootstrap and @xmath0-core percolation ,",
    "this is known to exhibit hybrid bifurcations  @xcite .    in these generalized percolation processes , typically we are interested in the final set of active nodes , but sometimes we may be interested in the temporal dynamics as these nodes become active  @xcite .",
    "if we are interested in the temporal dynamics , then we must assign additional rules for how long it takes for a node to become active .",
    "although the timing will depend on the details of the additional rules , the final set of active nodes is uniquely determined once the network , thresholds , and initially active nodes are chosen . for our purposes",
    "we focus just on the final state",
    ".    we will show that by appropriately choosing the distribution of @xmath13 and the initial set of active nodes , we can recover other versions of percolation from the wtm , including site percolation , @xmath0-core percolation , bootstrap percolation and the gep . going a step further , we show that the heterogeneous @xmath0-core of a network , the deleted nodes in heterogeneous bootstrap percolation , and the set of `` infected nodes '' in the gep are in fact all equivalent to the set of active nodes emerging from the wtm",
    ". that is , given one model and the corresponding distribution of thresholds , we can define the distribution of thresholds of the other models to yield the same sets of nodes with the same probabilities .",
    "a natural generalization of the wtm to consider has each node `` transmitting '' or `` passing a message '' with some fixed probability @xmath22 .",
    "we show that by modifying the threshold distribution the original wtm ( with @xmath23 ) can recover the same outcomes as for any other @xmath24 , and thus allowing for @xmath25 does not enlarge the set of possible outcomes .",
    "finally , we investigate the relation with bond percolation .",
    "if our interest in bond percolation is to identify the connected component containing a given node @xmath4 , then we can find this component using the wtm with @xmath4 as the initially active node and appropriate threshold distribution . to find all connected components",
    ", we can start the wtm with one initially active node , run it to completion , and then choose a remaining inactive node and rerun the wtm , iterating until no inactive nodes remain .",
    "the set of nodes that are activated in each pass correspond exactly to the components found in bond percolation .",
    "we begin by explicitly describing an algorithm which implements the wtm .",
    "each node is assigned a weight @xmath26 uniformly between @xmath27 and @xmath1 .",
    "we use a model - dependent function to convert the weight into a threshold @xmath13 , possibly depending on the degree of the node .",
    "typically we choose the function to return the largest value @xmath3 such that @xmath28 .",
    "if there are specified initially active nodes , they are given a threshold of zero .",
    "alternately we can allow the randomly assigned threshold to permit values @xmath29 in which case these nodes are initially active , and the iterative process begins .",
    "for each active node , we reduce the threshold of any inactive neighbor by @xmath1 . if a node s threshold reaches @xmath27 it activates .",
    "pseudocode for the algorithm is given in the appendix in figure  [ fig : wtm_alg ]    once the random thresholds and index nodes are set , the final outcome of the wtm is deterministic . to show that the other percolation processes give the same behavior",
    ", we will show how to structure these processes to start from the same random weights @xmath30 and deterministically yield a final state that is identical to the state found by the wtm for some threshold distribution .      in site percolation",
    ", each node is retained with probability @xmath5 or deleted with probability @xmath6 . to simulate site percolation",
    ", we can generate a random number @xmath31 independently and uniformly at random for each node @xmath4 . if @xmath32 ( which occurs with probability @xmath5 ) we keep @xmath4 , otherwise we delete it .",
    "it is straightforward to see that this is identical to the algorithm in figure  [ fig : wtm_alg ] if the threshold is set to be @xmath33 whenever @xmath32 and @xmath34 otherwise . in this case , with probability @xmath5 the node has threshold @xmath27 and so is initially active , while with probability @xmath6 it has threshold @xmath35 , and so can never become active as it will have at most @xmath36 active neighbors .",
    "thus , nodes are retained in site percolation iff they are active in the wtm .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : site_vs_wtm ] .",
    "1 +   +      we now consider @xmath0-core and heterogeneous @xmath0-core percolation .",
    "the classical @xmath0-core percolation is deterministic : each node with fewer than @xmath0 neighbors is deleted .",
    "this iterates until all remaining nodes have at least @xmath0 neighbors among the remaining nodes . to reproduce this with the wtm",
    ", we set @xmath37 regardless of @xmath30 .    with this threshold , all nodes with @xmath38 activate immediately in the wtm .",
    "in @xmath0-core percolation these same nodes are immediately deleted . for",
    "a given node @xmath4 not in this set , let the number of neighbors activated / deleted be denoted @xmath39",
    ". in the wtm , any remaining node with @xmath40 then activates . in @xmath0-core percolation",
    ", any node with @xmath41 is deleted .",
    "again , these nodes are the same . iterating as shown in figure  [ fig : karatekcore ] , the set of activated nodes in the wtm is the set of deleted nodes in @xmath0-core percolation .",

    "in fact , the gep we consider is equivalent to the wtm , and if we allow a node - specific threshold then both bootstrap and @xmath0-core percolation are also equivalent .",
    "which one should be considered the `` base '' model is a matter of personal choice .",
    "bond percolation is closely related to the wtm , but to arrive at an equivalent model , the wtm assigns thresholds from a geometric distribution , activates a node , follows the wtm process to completion , and then activates another node .",
    "the successive sets of activated nodes occur with the same probability as would be found in bond percolation .",
    "we have further shown that generalizing the wtm to allow for a homogeneous transmission probability @xmath22 from active nodes to neighboring inactive nodes results in a model which can be thought of as a special case of the wtm .",
    "thus the potential space of models is not increased by this modification .",
    "this commonality helps to explain why similar behaviors are observed and similar mathematical methods apply to these different processes .",

    "<S> in recent years , many variants of percolation have been used to study network structure and the behavior of processes spreading on networks . </S>",
    "<S> these include bond percolation , site percolation , @xmath0-core percolation , bootstrap percolation , the generalized epidemic process , and the watts threshold model ( wtm ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that  except for bond percolation  each of these processes arises as a special case of the wtm and bond percolation arises from a small modification . </S>",
    "<S> in fact `` heterogeneous @xmath0-core percolation '' , a corresponding `` heterogeneous bootstrap percolation '' model , and the generalized epidemic process are completely equivalent to one another and the wtm . </S>",
    "<S> we further show that a natural generalization of the wtm in which individuals `` transmit '' or `` send a message '' to their neighbors with some probability less than @xmath1 can be reformulated in terms of the wtm , and so this apparent generalization is in fact not more general . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that in bond percolation , finding the set of nodes in the component containing a given node is equivalent to finding the set of nodes activated if that node is initially activated and the node thresholds are chosen from the appropriate distribution . </S>",
    "<S> a consequence of these results is that mathematical techniques developed for the wtm apply to these other models as well , and techniques that were developed for some particular case may in fact apply much more generally . </S>"
