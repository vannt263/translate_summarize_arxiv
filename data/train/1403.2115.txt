    "high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy provides a powerful technique for studying the interstellar medium ( ism ) since the analysis of absorption features allows the identification of atomic and molecular transitions directly related to its physical and chemical properties . in this context , a chemical element of much interest is oxygen due to its cosmic abundance and foremost spectral features , namely k - edge structures whose models can lead to reliable estimates of its abundance , column densities , and ionization fractions .    a prominent oxygen k edge and hints of a resonant @xmath6 absorption line were reported in the pioneering work by @xcite on the crab nebula soft x - ray spectrum ( @xmath7  kev ) taken with the einstein observatory .",
    "no apparent evidence for depletion was therein found thus implying dust grain sizes of @xmath8 m .",
    "a further attempt to exploit the oxygen k - shell absorption region was performed by @xcite , who analyzed the spectra of seven x - ray binaries taken with the satellite - borne _ chandra _ high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) .",
    "their model included two absorption edges ( @xmath9 and five gaussians corresponding to k@xmath0 ( @xmath6 ) transitions in , , and and k@xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) in .",
    "as a result , they managed to constrain the oxygen ionization fractions to @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite performed a similar analysis including observations of seven galactic low - mass x - ray binaries taken with both the high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) and low energy transmission grating ( letg ) on board _ chandra_. the and k@xmath0 lines and the k@xmath10 detected in three of these sources were associated to the hot interstellar medium ( hism ) whose distribution was also estimated ; however , due to the few lines of sight , such inference could be biased .",
    "@xcite studied high - resolution spectra of the cygnus  x-2 low - mass x - ray binary taken with the _ xmm - newton _ space telescope , concluding that the complexity of the oxygen edge could be explained by absorption of both molecular and ionized atomic species . moreover , in an analysis of the oxygen k - shell edge in _ xmm - newton _ spectra towards galaxy clusters , @xcite determined a high gas - to - dust ratio in the galaxy , pointing out that the composition of denser clouds could be similar to the diffuse ism .",
    "@xcite have fitted _ chandra _ hetg data from five x - ray binaries with an absorption model referred to as tbnew , and suggested that ism absorption dominated the neutral column density . from similar observations of the line of sight of cygnus  x-2",
    ", @xcite detected k absorption lines from , , , , and , determining abundances that indicated mild oxygen depletion onto dust grains in the cold phase . from _ xmm - newton _ reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs )",
    "spectra of the x - ray binary sco  x-1 , @xcite have deduced the presence of extended x - ray absorption fine structures ( exaf ) and that around @xmath14 of the oxygen was bound in solid material .",
    "however , @xcite showed that , by using an accurate photoionization cross section for atomic , observations of this source in the @xmath15    region could be adequately reproduced with no evidence of additional molecular and dust contributions .",
    "@xcite have considered both the dust and gas components in the ism absorption features towards the low - mass x - ray binary gs  1826 - 238 ; they found oxygen to be over abundant and a gas ionization degree above @xmath16 , concluding that at least @xmath17 of the oxygen was found in molecules or dust .",
    "more recently , @xcite have measured oxygen column densities and estimated abundance gradients from _ xmm - newton _ grating spectra of nine low - mass x - ray binaries , concluding that @xmath18 of the oxygen is found in dust .",
    "they also point out that the ratios between different ionization stages are similar among the lines of sight suggesting large - scale chemical homogeneity . @xcite",
    "have analyzed 36 _ chandra _ hetg observations from eleven low - mass x - ray binaries taking into consideration a correction for the galactic rotation velocity relative to the rest frame . through a bayesian statistical approach and a combined fit ,",
    "they detect several spectral features in the oxygen - edge region including k@xmath0 lines from , , , , , , and .",
    "@xcite have presented a self - consistent physical model of ism oxygen k absorption to fit four _ chandra _ spectra of xte  j1817 - 330 , a low - mass x - ray binary with high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the oxygen k - edge region is fitted with a photoionization model derived with the xstar computer code @xcite referred to as warmabs .",
    "it is found that the k lines and photoionization cross sections must be slightly wavelength shifted in order to match the observed spectra .",
    "the resulting low ionization parameter indicate a dominant neutral component with absorption lines from k@xmath0 , k@xmath10 , and k@xmath19 together with k@xmath0 from and .",
    "k@xmath0 lines from and are also detected , but it is argued that they probably arise in the neighborhood of the source rather than in the ism ; unsurprisingly , molecular features in the o k - edge region are not found in this study .    in the present work",
    "we refine the building blocks of our model of ism oxygen photoabsorption , and explore its possibilities in describing the high - resolution _ chandra _ spectra of eight x - ray binaries .",
    "since this process is dominated by the neutral , we evaluate the impact of the atomic data on model prediction by considering both the new and definitive cross section by @xcite and previous data of @xcite . although dramatic revelations are not expected with the present line - of - sight sampling , we are at least certain to contribute to the current discussion on ism phase composition and local variability .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec_atom ]",
    "we give details concerning the atomic data sets , and the observational reduction steps are described in section  [ sec_obs ] .",
    "the fitting procedures of @xcite for the broadband and oxygen - edge regions are recapitulated in section  [ sec_fit ] followed by the fit results ( sections  [ sec_fit_broad][sec_fit_oxygen ] ) .",
    "a discussion of results is carried out in section  [ sec_ism ] in order to draw some conclusions in section  [ sec_conclusion ] .",
    "a detailed and quantitative description of inner - shell photoabsorption processes is of vital importance to sustain astrophysical inferences from ism x - ray absorption spectra , and as recently discussed for oxygen @xcite , unsatisfactory discrepancies in both experimental and theoretical atomic data have led to a variety of disjoint conclusions regarding ionization and atomic - to - molecular fractions . in this respect ,",
    "the spectral edge resonance structures , which give rise to useful astrophysical imprints , are particularly difficult to master as they strongly depend on ionization fractions and a variety of subtle relaxation effects such as auger and radiative damping .",
    "the latter atomic processes were taken into account in the photoabsorption cross sections of oxygen ions computed by @xcite , which have been incorporated in the warmabs physical model ( see section  [ sec_fit ] ) . however , their previous application in x - ray binary spectral modeling , namely _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ observations of sco x-1 @xcite and xte j1817330 @xcite , required small wavelength shifts of the theoretical lines in order to secure accurate fits .",
    "@xcite have recently made a serious attempt to establish a definitive photoabsorption model for by taking care of all the relevant features ",
    "shoulders , line positions , widths , and oscillator strengths  and by providing a handy analytical expression for prospective users . however , a bothersome discrepancy of 0.6  ev still persists between the astronomically observed k - line position and laboratory measurements . unconventionally and as fully discussed in @xcite , the final energy scale was calibrated by aligning to the former for the following reasons .",
    "first , the astronomical calibration is consistent with that of the well - understood k@xmath0 line .",
    "second , the accuracy of the molecular data used in the experimental calibration is not altogether clear @xcite , and preliminary measurements appear to indicate that the experimental k - edge calibration may indeed need a revision ( w.  c. stolte , private communications , 2014 ) .",
    "moreover , @xcite also found a @xmath20% dispersion in the background oscillator strengths that is now eliminated by benchmarking to the above - threshold experimental results @xcite .",
    "we are of the opinion that the small warmabs uncertainties due to these two cross sections finally closes the argument on atomic oxygen data translation .",
    "in order to study the ism oxygen edge along different lines of sight , we analyze _ chandra _ spectra of eight low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "table [ tab1 ] tabulates the observational specifications , namely ids , dates , exposure times , and read modes .",
    "all spectra have been obtained with the medium energy gratings ( meg ) from the hetgs in combination with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) .",
    "observations were taken in continuous clocking mode ( cc ) or time exposure mode ( te ) , in the former the temporal resolution is increased in order to minimize the pileup effect @xcite .",
    "pileup is concerned with the detection of two or more photons as a single event , and can produce a deformation of the continuum level and shape and , consequently , must be reduced as much as possible @xcite .",
    "we have estimated the pileup contribution along the broadband region with the simplegpile2 procedure . in te mode",
    ", the acis instrument reads the collected photons periodically . in both cases",
    ", we have reduced the data using the standard ciao threads taking into account that , if the zero - order data were not telemetered , the zero - order position was estimated using the findzo algorithm .",
    "finally , we have used the isis package ( version 1.6.2 - 27 ) for spectral fitting .",
    "following @xcite , we estimate the hydrogen column density using an x - ray absorption model combined with a pileup convolution model ( hereafter referred to as the broadband fit ) .",
    "we then reproduce the oxygen - edge region using the warmabs model to obtain physical properties related to the gas ionization and elemental abundances . in the broadband region",
    "( 1124   ) , we fit all observations for each source simultaneously with the simplegpile2(tbnew(powerlaw ) ) model in order to obtain , using @xmath21 statistics , an estimate of the hydrogen column density .",
    "the simplegpile2 is a convolution model that takes into account pileup effects , and tbnew is an x - ray absorption model that includes chemical elements with atomic numbers @xmath22 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "in addition to the h column density , @xmath23 , we treat the abundances of o , ne , and fe as free parameters .",
    "we group each spectrum to obtain a 0.1    bin size and add gaussians to fit the remaining absorption lines , if any .",
    "we fix the absorption parameters in all the observations and vary the power law , pileup , and gaussian parameters in each case .",
    "we then introduce the photoabsorption cross sections by @xcite and chemical abundances by @xcite although the resulting abundances are given relative to @xcite for consistency with the warmabs output .    in the oxygen - edge region",
    "( 2124   ) , we rebin the data to obtain 20 counts per channel in order to proceed with the analysis using @xmath21 statistics @xcite .",
    "the free variables are the ionization parameter ( log @xmath24 ) , oxygen abundance ( @xmath25 ) , turbulent broadening ( in kms@xmath26 ) , and redshift , while the hydrogen column density is held fixed at the value obtained in the previous broadband fit . for each source",
    ", we fit all observations simultaneously using the same warmabs data but varying the power - law parameters for each observation .",
    "we perform two separate fits : ( 1 ) using the photoabsorption cross sections by @xcite for o ions and ( 2 ) using the new cross section by @xcite for and those by @xcite for the other ionized species . as previously mentioned , we intend to assess these atomic cross sections by delimiting the variations they produce in the ism oxygen abundances and ionization fractions .",
    "abundances are again given relative to the solar standard by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the broadband fit using the simple_gpile2.sl(tbnew(powerlaw ) ) model for each source in the 1124    spectral region . in the case of sco  x-1",
    "the fit was performed in the 1524    interval as there are no counts below @xmath27   . for each source",
    "the observation with the highest signal - to - noise is plotted and residuals in units of @xmath28 are also given . in all cases the ne - edge absorption region",
    "( 1315   ) dominates the broadband fit due to a higher photon count ( a factor of @xmath29 higher than the photon count in the oxygen edge ) .",
    "fit results are given in table [ tab2 ] including the set for xte  j1817 - 330 obtained by @xcite where it may be seen that the reduced chi - square values denote a good fit in each case .",
    "oxygen , neon , and iron abundances are found to be in the ranges @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , respectively . for sco",
    "x-1 we freeze the ne abundance at the solar value because , as previously mentioned , its spectra do not include the ne - edge absorption region .",
    "( hydrogen column densities will be discussed in section  [ sec_fit_hydrogen ] . )",
    "it should be noted that the tbnew model only accounts for photoabsorption cross sections of neutral species which , as discussed by @xcite , introduces a bias in the broadband - fit parameters such as abundances and h column densities . regarding pileup effects",
    ", the simple_gpile2.sl model gives @xmath10 values in the range @xmath33 that correspond to pileup degrees in the 1121    region lower than 68% for sco  x-1 , 31% for cygnus  x-1 , 17% for 4u  1820 - 30 , and 6% for 4u  1636 - 53 , 4u  1735 - 44 , and gx  9 + 9 . in the oxygen - edge region",
    "( 2124   ) , all sources display pileup degrees lower than 1% that can be safely ignored although they must still be considered in the broadband - fit stage .",
    "hydrogen column densities derived in the broadband fit are compared in table  [ tab3 ] with previous estimates , in particular two 21  cm surveys and the results by @xcite who obtained the continuum parameters from fits of the 23.724.7    line - free region .",
    "good agreement is found except for cygnus  x-1 and sco  x-1 . in the case of cygnus  x-1",
    "it is important to note that , as discussed by @xcite , the 21  cm surveys do not resolve @xmath34 variations in the region around the source ; therefore , we would consider our value to be more reliable . for sco",
    "x-1 @xcite found evidence for absorption as a function of x - ray branches ( i.e. the position of the source in an x - ray color  color diagram ) , in a range from @xmath35  @xmath4 on the horizontal branch to @xmath36  @xmath4 on the normal branch .",
    "we conclude that , due to source variability , it is difficult to constrain the hydrogen column density ; furthermore , it must also be pointed out that the discrepancies in @xmath34 estimates may also arise from the treatment of the source x - ray intrinsic continuum in each model .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the best fits of the oxygen - edge region using the warmabs(powerlaw ) model where , for each source , the observation with the highest signal - to - noise is plotted in the 2124    wavelength interval .",
    "the dominant features are the and k@xmath0 absorption lines . due to the low counts ,",
    "the detection of absorption lines from resonances with principal quantum number @xmath37 is impaired , the exception being xte  j1817 - 330 with good quality spectra that also display k@xmath0 absorption lines from and . in this respect ,",
    "@xcite have proposed that the k@xmath0 line in xte  j1817 - 330 is formed in the source neighborhood rather than in the ism .",
    "the puzzling absence of the latter line in other sources has been reported by @xcite , who studied cygnus  x-2 spectra and suggested the possibility of an resonance emission line annulling its absorption .",
    "this effect has been apparently confirmed by @xcite in analyses of _ xmm - newton _ rgs and _ chandra _ meg spectra , although the exact origin of the emission line is not completely understood .",
    "the best warmabs fit parameters using the photoabsorption cross section by @xcite are given in table  [ tab4 ] .",
    "for all sources the ionization parameter is found to be fairly low , with an average value of @xmath1 that points to the predominance of neutral and singly ionized oxygen species .",
    "there are differences in oxygen abundances among the lines of sight , @xmath38 , with an average value of @xmath2 that is consistent with the oxygen abundance reported for xte  j1817 - 330 by @xcite .",
    "if the photoabsorption cross section in warmabs is replaced with that by @xcite , the outcome is not significantly different ( see table  [ tab5 ] ) : an average ionization parameter of @xmath39 , oxygen abundances in the range of @xmath40 , and an abundance average value of @xmath41 .",
    "it must be clarified here , however , that these o abundances are given relative to the solar standard by @xcite , but as discussed by @xcite , if they are rescaled according to the revision by @xcite , the abundance average values would be fairly close to solar .",
    "the small differences in model output caused by the two photoabsorption cross sections give us confidence that the issue of oxygen atomic data accuracy has been finally settled , and consequently , the data set by @xcite for can certainly be recommended as the standard in x - ray spectral modeling .",
    "the oxygen abundances for 4u  1735 - 44 and gx-9 + 9 by @xcite when rescaled to the solar standard of @xcite , respectively @xmath42 and @xmath43 , are in good agreement with the present values ( see table  [ tab4 ] ) . on the other hand , for 4u  1820 - 30 we find @xmath44 , a value greater than that estimated by @xcite of @xmath45 ; however , the hydrogen column densities lead to a similar oxygen column density in both works .",

    "the sources are ordered according to their total counts ( high to low ) , and the resulting abundance mean values are also shown .",
    "since the abundances obtained for most sources with these two cross sections agree to within the error bars , we proceed our analysis with the most recent @xcite .",
    "the overabundance in the line of sight of 4u  1820 - 30 is worth noting since it could originate in the source neighborhood in the metal - rich ngc6624 globular cluster @xcite , even though @xcite have pointed out the difficulty of assigning the precise location of the absorbing gas . in a similar fashion , the ionization parameter for each source",
    "is depicted in figure  [ fig4 ] where a low ionization degree is maintained along the different lines of sight .",
    "this result is consistent with the predominant and k@xmath0 absorption lines observed .",
    "also , the scatter around the mean value is well constrained by the error bars that tend to increase with decreasing count number .",
    "a map of the warmabs oxygen abundance _",
    "vs_. ionization parameter is shown in figure  [ fig5 ] , where the error bars indicate that the ionization parameter is not as well constrained as the oxygen abundance ; this is due to the saturation of the and k@xmath0 lines .",
    "the plot shows that the ism ionization state is generally low and the oxygen abundance lies below solar except for 4u  1820 - 30 where its overabundance , as previously mentioned , is likely to be due to its location in the metal - rich ngc6624 globular cluster .",
    "the map of the tbnew hydrogen column density _",
    "vs_. the warmabs oxygen abundance in figure  [ fig6 ] shows that the hydrogen column density is better constrained , which may a consequence of the low counts in the oxygen - edge region where the warmabs fits are performed . the high hydrogen column density of cygnus  x-1 has been attributed to the presence of an accreted stellar wind along the line of sight @xcite .      total oxygen column densities ( @xmath46 ) are listed in table [ tab6 ] where the warmabs values take into account contributions from , , and .",
    "data by @xcite are also tabulated , who estimated the oxygen column densities with the optical depth at 21.7   and the photoabsorption cross section by @xcite at that wavelength .",
    "cygnus  x-1 has the highest oxygen column density probably due to the stellar wind from the supergiant companion star as discussed by @xcite . in the case of 4u  1820 - 30 ,",
    "its low hydrogen column density results in a low oxygen column density despite its high oxygen abundance .    a plot of the total oxygen column density _ vs. _ ionization parameter is depicted in figure  [ fig7 ] .",
    "it shows that the sources appear to have both low ionization parameters and low oxygen column densities ; if a correlation does exist between these two properties , a more extensive data analysis would be needed to verify it . for cygnus",
    "x-1 and gx  9 + 9 , the high hydrogen column densities increase the oxygen column densities although the sources have low ionization parameters .",
    "the average oxygen column density of our sampling is @xmath3  @xmath4 .",
    "as signatures of a multiphase structure in the ism , the presence of neutral , medium , and highly ionized atomic species in addition to molecules has been previously studied with high resolution x - ray spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "they mostly involve the use of gaussians to fit the observed absorption lines ; for instance , @xcite have recently analyzed 36 _ chandra _ hetg observations of 11 low - mass x - ray binaries by co - adding all the spectra . for each observation ,",
    "the central wavelengths of the atomic transitions were corrected for the galactic rotation velocity relative to the rest frame .",
    "several transitions in the oxygen , magnesium , and neon edges were therein identified , followed by a bayesian statistical analysis to determine the systematic uncertainties of the measurements .",
    "very high accuracy is reached for the line positions , but in contrast to the present self - consistent model fit , the procedures based on gaussians are limited regarding line identification and formation .",
    "a further disadvantage of such methods when compared to the simultaneous fit lies in the fact that the intrinsic lines with the higher signal - to - noise dominate the co - added spectra .",
    "this may lead to the wrong conclusion that each line is present in all observations ; as a counterexample , we find that the and k@xmath0 absorption lines are only present in the xte  j1817 - 330 spectra as reported by @xcite .",
    "it is known that the use of gaussian profiles without an underlying analysis of the physical conditions of the gas can lead to incorrect identifications .",
    "for instance , table  4 of @xcite lists k@xmath0 absorption lines from and as well as k@xmath0 , k@xmath10 , and k@xmath19 ; however , as explained by @xcite , the neutral component dominates such ism spectra , and these lines would actually correspond to k@xmath10 and k@xmath19 transitions in and . in support of this view",
    ", present results also point to the dominance of the ism neutral component in different lines of sight , with a low ionization degree and small variations of the oxygen abundances due to plasma enrichment in the local environment ( e.g. the presence of globular clusters ) .",
    "table  [ tab7 ] lists the , , and column densities for each source as derived from a set of xstar simulations using the parameters from the warmabs fit . in correspondence with the predicted low ionization parameters ,",
    "the column density ratios @xmath5()/@xmath5 ( ) and @xmath5()/@xmath5 ( ) are estimated to be less than 0.1 .",
    "contrary to @xcite , we only detect k@xmath0 in xte  j1817 - 330 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this line probably arises in the source neighborhood , and due to its brightness , an approach using multiple x - ray binaries and spectra addition is likely to assign its origin to the ism ; however , our approach clearly confirms its absence in the rest of the sources .",
    "the appearance of highly ionized metal absorption lines in spectra toward galactic x - ray binaries has been recently considered by @xcite , who found that most of them arise in the hot gas intrinsic to the source , the ism only making a small contribution . on the other hand , uv studies have shown the presence of lines towards multiple galactic lines of sight that would enable us to determine the conditions required to detect absorption in x - ray spectra .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite , using data from the far - ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) , derived average column densities of @xmath47  @xmath4 in the halo region , @xmath48  @xmath4 in the galactic thick disk , and @xmath49  @xmath4 perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "according to the atomic data used in this work , these values would correspond to equivalent widths of @xmath50 m , @xmath51 m , and @xmath52 m , respectively . in this respect ,",
    "we have performed data simulations using the hetg response files and typical exposure times that have led us to conclude that , for these ew , a statistically acceptable detection would be unsuccessful . in fact , an column density of at least @xmath53  @xmath4 would be required to enable the fit of a gaussian profile .",
    "an inspection of our fit residuals , by no means negligible , has led to no conclusive evidence regarding photoabsorption by molecules or condensed matter .",
    "this may seem polemic as previous studies , even when using comprehensive physical models , have reported that some of the ism oxygen is indeed depleted to the solid phase .",
    "for example , @xcite have concluded that around 1525 % of the oxygen is condensed onto dust .",
    "however , it is important to note that in their analysis they include fe l - edge absorption as well , adding to their models solid oxides such as magnetite ( fe@xmath54o@xmath55 ) and hematite ( fe@xmath56o@xmath54 ) . in this respect",
    ", our model does lack the two - edge perspective which would perhaps be more reliable in clarifying this contentious issue .",
    "we have carried out an analysis of ism oxygen k absorption by means of high - resolution x - ray spectra toward eight low - mass galactic binaries . for this purpose",
    "we are employing a physical model , referred to as warmabs , that is capable of determining the physical state of the gas .",
    "a broadband fit was performed to constrain the hydrogen column density using the simple_gpile2.sl(tbnew(powerlaw ) ) model .",
    "the pileup effect was estimated from the fit indicating that it must be taken into account in the 1124    region , although it can be safely ignored around the oxygen edge ( 2124   ) .",
    "the hydrogen column densities derived from the fits are in good agreement with previous work , although in the case of cygnus  x-1 it is difficult to constrain it due to the presence of an alleged stellar wind along the line of sight .    for each source ,",
    "the simultaneous fit of the oxygen edge region with the warmabs model provides estimates of the ionization parameter and oxygen abundance .",
    "the simultaneous fit is implemented to avoid the overlapping between ism and intrinsic absorption features thus allowing a reliable study through the line of sight .",
    "the low ionization degree is consistent with the prevalence of and k@xmath0 absorption lines , supporting the dominance of the neutral component in the plasma .",
    "the fits yield an average oxygen abundance ( @xmath2 ) lower than solar if the standard by @xcite is assumed , but fairly close to solar when rescaling to the revision by @xcite . in the case of 4u  1820 - 30 oxygen enrichment",
    "is encountered , a likely consequence of the source location in the metal - rich ngc6624 globular cluster .",
    "it is important to note that our conclusions are backed by the present benchmark of oxygen atomic data @xcite which we now confidently recommend as the standard for future x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "we do not detect high - ionization lines except in xte  j1817 - 330 which , as mentioned by @xcite , may arise in the source neighborhood rather than in the actual ism . using the column densities obtained by @xcite and @xcite from uv data ,",
    "we have carried out a set data simulations to estimate the typical column densities that would enable a statistically acceptable k@xmath0 line detection , finding that a minimum of @xmath57  @xmath4 is required to allow the fitting with a gaussian .",
