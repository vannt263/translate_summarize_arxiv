    "intra - cluster medium ( icm ) , i.e. , the hot plasma confined within the gravitational potential of clusters of galaxies , constitutes the most dominant _ known _ form of baryons .",
    "the icm was thought to cool over the hubble time by emitting optically - thin thermal x - rays , because its radiative cooling time is estimated to be @xmath5 yr at the center of many `` cd clusters '' ( those hosting cd galaxies at their centers ) .",
    "this inspired so - called cooling flow ( hereafter cf ) hypothesis  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the idea was apparently supported by several soft x - ray features observed around cd galaxies , including general decreases of the icm temperature , strong excess x - ray surface brightness , and excess photoelectric absorption up to a few times @xmath6 @xmath7 .    with the first imaging capability over a broad x - ray energy band up to 10  kev and a much improved energy resolution than was available before , _",
    "@xcite has provided a number of new results that altogether cast serious doubt upon the reality of cfs .",
    "these include ; a shortage of the predicted cool gas in the hydra - a cluster  @xcite ; the presence of uncooled icm in 3-dimensional core regions of the centaurus cluster  @xcite ; a central excess brightness of abell  1795 that does not depend strongly on the x - ray energy  @xcite ; hierarchical potential structures in several galaxy groups  @xcite ; and systematic differences in the icm chemical composition between the central and outer regions of cd clusters  @xcite .",
    "we compiled all these results in ( * ? ? ? *",
    "hereafter paper  i ) , and argued that the classical cf hypothesis needs a significant revision .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "suggestions have been reconfirmed and reinforced by _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the cf scenario in its original form is no longer considered valid , the icm temperature of a cd cluster does decrease toward the center .",
    "furthermore , the deprojected radial icm temperature profiles of a fair number of clusters all reduce to a single `` universal '' profile  @xcite , which reach , at the cluster center , a minimum value of @xmath8 @xcite . here , @xmath9 is the icm temperature observed outside @xmath10 kpc .",
    "it is yet to be explained how the intriguing universal temperature profile and the scaling of eq.([eq : tcth ] ) are produced , and how they are related to mechanisms which suppress cfs .",
    "the concept of the universal temperature profile is based on a `` single - phase '' ( hereafter 1p ) picture , that the icm at a given three - dimensional radius is represented by a single dominant temperature which monotonically decreases toward the center .",
    "in contrast , the original _ asca _ results on cd clusters  ( paper  i ) are based primarily on a `` two - phase '' ( hereafter 2p ) view ; the icm consists of a `` hot phase '' and a `` cool phase '' , intermixed together , with the volume filling factor of the latter increasing toward the center .",
    "this view was at the beginning motivated by the complex angular response of the _ asca _ telescopes , but was reinforced _",
    "a posteriori _ by the fact that 2p fits to the _ asca _ spectra of a cluster generally give a pair of well - defined temperatures regardless of the two - dimensional radii used to extract the signal photons  ( e.g. fukazawa et al .",
    "1994 ; paper  i ) .",
    "in other words , the 2p modeling is likely to be more than a mere convention .",
    "generally , the hot - phase and cool - phase temperatures , derived under the 2p assumption , are respectively close to @xmath11 and @xmath9 of eq.([eq : tcth ] ) obtained through the 1p analysis .",
    "furthermore , eq.([eq : tcth ] ) holds for the 2p results as well  @xcite .",
    "the 1p and 2p approaches are thus consistent in the sense that both yield essentially the same two characteristic temperatures , @xmath11 and @xmath9",
    ". nevertheless , their physical implications are much different . the 1p situation would require a fine tuning between the radiative cooling and the putative heating mechanism , or ",
    "quasi - hydrostatic \" gas cooling @xcite . to realize the 2p condition , in contrast",
    ", the cool phase must be thermally insulated from the hot phase , and heated in a stable manner , so that it should neither evaporate  @xcite , nor collapse due to cooling .",
    "yet another possibility is that the icm temperature takes a range of values even at a single radius  @xcite ; this is to be called `` multi - phase '' picture .    in order to identify the cf - suppression mechanism ,",
    "it is of basic importance to clarify which of the 1p and 2p pictures ( or the multiphase view ) is closer to the reality . in spite of its importance",
    ", there have been few attempts to address this issue .",
    "we hence analyze in the present paper the _ xmm - newton _ data of the centaurus cluster .",
    "this object is best suited to our purpose , because it harbors the very prominent cool component and has extensively been studied with _ asca_. our strategy is to examine whether or not deprojected spectra of this cluster require the presence of multiple temperatures at each 3-dimensional radius .",
    "the data will also allow us to reconfirm the lack of emission with temperature below the value of eq.([eq : tcth ] ) .    in  2 , we briefly summarize previous x - ray results on the centaurus cluster , and describe the _ xmm - newton _ observations in  3 .",
    "section 4 , which forms the core of the present paper , is devoted to the description of data analysis and results .",
    "the results are discussed in  5 , followed by a summary in  6 . throughout the paper ,",
    "the hubble constant is expressed as @xmath12  km  @xmath13  mpc@xmath13 .",

    "errors represent 90  % confidence limits unless stated otherwise .",
    "located at a redshift of @xmath16 = 0.0104  @xcite where @xmath17 corresponds to 12.5 kpc , the centaurus cluster ( abell  3526 ) is one of the most well studied objects among nearby clusters .",
    "it exhibits a roughly round shape , and its cd galaxy , ngc  4696 , does not show significant nuclear activity . in x - rays ,",

    "@xcite , _ exosat _  @xcite , and _ ginga _  @xcite .",
    "these observations yielded an icm temperature of @xmath0  kev , except in the central region  ( @xmath18 ) where a very prominent cool component and an excess brightness are observed .",
    "@xcite studied the centaurus cluster using the data from the _ rosat _ pspc .",
    "they found some evidence of metallicity increase and excess absorption at the center . through a deprojection analysis , they also derived 3-dimensional properties of the icm under the 1p modeling , reporting that the icm is cooled down to @xmath19  kev toward the center .    using _ asca _ with the much improved energy resolution and the wider energy band ,",
    "@xcite successfully resolved both the fe - k line and low - energy emission lines , and detected hot and cool components with a temperature of @xmath0 and @xmath19 kev , respectively .",
    "the strong metallicity increase toward the center was reconfirmed .",
    "they also discovered that the 3-dimensional core region ( @xmath20 ) of the cluster is filled mostly with the hot component , whereas the cool component occupies a minor fraction of the volume . through a more detailed analysis of the _ asca _ data",
    ", @xcite showed that the 1p density and temperature profiles derived with _",
    "@xcite underpredict the hard x - ray flux from the central region , and hence fail to explain the 0.510  kev _ asca _ data .",
    "@xcite instead found that the _ asca _ spectra from various regions near the center can be described adequately by the 2p formalism employing the two components identified by @xcite .",
    "this reinforced the presence of the hot phase in the three - dimensional core region , and justified the 2p approach .",
    "the 2p formalism on the centaurus cluster was further refined and reinforced by @xcite . incorporating two temperatures of @xmath21  kev and @xmath22  kev , together with a central metallicity increase",
    ", they successfully constructed a 3-dimensional icm model that can simultaneously explain the _ rosat _ surface brightness and the _ asca _ annular spectra , namely the best - quality data sets available at that time . the excess absorption at the center , clamed by @xcite based on the _ asca _ data , was not reconfirmed by @xcite .    utilizing the unprecedented angular resolution of _ chandra _",
    ", @xcite detected a `` plume '' like x - ray feature near the center of the centaurus cluster , reconfirming a previous observation with the _ rosat _ high resolution imager  @xcite . within @xmath23 of the center including the `` plume '' region , a cool plasma component with a temperature of @xmath2 kev was clearly detected @xcite . employing the 1p formalism , @xcite also derived the icm temperature distribution near the center ( @xmath24 ) , but the field of view of _ chandra _ was not wide enough to determine the global temperature structure over the entire `` cool '' region ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "there are some indications that a subcluster centered on the elliptical galaxy ngc  4709 is merging with the main body .",
    "this region exhibits an excess x - ray surface brightness and a temperature increase to @xmath25 kev   @xcite .",
    "however , these effects , seen @xmath26 off the center , are considered to be small in regions which we analyze ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "in fact , using _ suzaku _ , @xcite showed that the icm within the central @xmath28 can be regarded as hydrostatic : specifically , they set an upper limit of @xmath29 km s@xmath13 on any large - scale ( @xmath10 kpc ) bulk motion in the icm over this region , and ruled out a previously claimed detection of significant bulk motions @xcite .",
    "the centaurus cluster was observed with _",
    "xmm - newton _ on 2002 january  3 for a gross exposure of 45 ksec .",
    "the boresight was set to ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) = @xmath32 .",
    "the epic pn and mos were operated both in the full frame mode with the thin filters  @xcite , while the rgs in spectroscopy mode  @xcite .",
    "the epic dataset obtained in the same observation were already analyzed by @xcite mainly for metallicity distributions .",
    "the present paper emphasizes the temperature structure .",
    "similarly , @xcite utilized the rgs data from the same observation , as well as those from an additional 110 ks observation .",
    "the epic data were extracted using the standard sas software of version  5.4.1 .",
    "we selected events with _ pattern _",
    "@xmath33 for pn and _ pattern _",
    "@xmath34 for mos , with which most of the valid x - ray events are accepted .",
    "according to instructions by the detector team , we further discarded events with bad flags , e.g. , those out of the field of view and those detected at bad ccd pixels .",
    "soft protons often cause the epic background to increase suddenly by up to two orders of magnitude .",
    "these sporadic `` flares '' must be removed carefully when analyzing extended sources .",
    "we accordingly produced 27  kev band light curves of the present data , excluding a central region  ( @xmath35 ) where the cluster emission dominates .",
    "this particular energy band was shown by @xcite to serve as a good measure of the epic background , and is roughly optimized in the present case to provide a high signal - to - ratio for proton flares ; below @xmath36 kev the cluster signals become significant , while above @xmath37 kev the fluorescent background lines in the pn spectra become a nuisance .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we then discarded those time periods when the count rates deviate by more than @xmath38 from those in quiescent periods .",
    "after this screening , the net exposure time became 31  ksec with pn and 43  ksec with mos .",
    "several faint point sources are found in the field of view .",
    "we excluded regions where their signals are significant , typically within @xmath39 of each source .",
    "since the cluster emission fills nearly the entire epic field of view , background spectra must be constructed using some other `` blank sky '' data . for this purpose",
    ", we utilized the observation of pg  1115 + 080 for pn  ( obsid=0082340101 ) , and that of vik  59 for mos  ( obsid=0107860501 ) , because these data sets showed a close similarity to the present centaurus data in terms of high - energy ( 1114  kev for pn and 1012  kev for mos ) count rates accumulated over peripheral regions of the fields of view .    after removing proton flares and celestial point x - ray sources in the same manner , we extracted background events from these data sets , using the same regions on the detectors as employed to accumulate the on - source data .",
    "the background derived in this way is estimated to be accurate generally to within @xmath40 , except at some particular spectral regions @xcite , as detailed in  [ subsub : syserr ] , where we employ 8% .",
    "this accuracy is sufficient for our purpose , because the cluster emission is much brighter than the background , e.g. , by more than a factor of five , at least up to @xmath41 from the aimpoint in energies below 5 kev .",
    "thus , the background uncertainty therein is at most a few percent of the cluster signal .      to discriminate the 1p and 2p conditions",
    ", it is essential to remove the projection effects , using so - called deprojection procedure . to create deprojected spectra",
    ", we employed the standard `` onion peeling '' method  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , assuming that the object is spherically symmetric , and the plasma is uniformly distributed in each thin shell region .",
    "no model spectra were assumed in our deprojection procedure .",
    "specifically , at each energy @xmath42 , we calculated the deprojected spectrum @xmath43 in the @xmath44-th shell as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the projected spectrum accumulated over the @xmath47-th annulus , @xmath48 is a triangular matrix derived by inverting the projection matrix , and @xmath49 denotes the outermost annulus .",
    "below , we utilize the data within @xmath50 ( 150 kpc ) of the x - ray centroid at @xmath51 , which coincides with the ngc  4696 nucleus .",
    "the emission outside @xmath50 , @xmath52 , was calculated assuming that the plasma is isothermal and isoabundance at @xmath53 , and that the icm density profile is expressed by a @xmath54 model determined jointly with _",
    "asca _ and _ rosat _ , namely @xmath55 and the core radius of @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "these parameters can reproduce the _ xmm - newton _ images themselves  @xcite .",
    "actual matrix elements of @xmath57 are numerically given in appendix a.      in order to take into account calibration uncertainties , conservative systematic errors of 2% @xcite were assigned to the on - source spectra in energies above 0.6  kev . below that energy , the systematic error was increased to 5% to represent uncertainties in the quantum efficiency around the oxygen absorption edge  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to further consider systematic uncertainties involved in the background subtraction process , we assigned to the background data the systematic errors as given in table [ tbl : syserror ]",
    "the errors are thus taken to be 8% (  [ subsub : epic_bkgd ] ) in those energy bands where the background is dominated by instrumental fluorescence lines , because their intensities are known to vary rather independently of that of the background continuum . in energies below @xmath19 kev , the background spectra",
    "are significantly contributed by diffuse soft x - ray background , of which the brightness varies from sky to sky .",
    "there , we hence employed the same 8% systematic error , although the background in this energy range is generally negligible compared to the bright cluster emission . in other energy regions , we employed a nominal value of 3% (  [ subsub : epic_bkgd ] ) .      again using the sas software , we processed the rgs data , and extracted the first and second order spectra within @xmath58 ( in the cross - dispersion direction ) of the center .",
    "the spectral range of 623    was analyzed , in order to utilize many atomic lines therein .",
    "the rgs background was derived from blank sky fields which were made available by the instrument team  @xcite . because these authors reported that the rms fluctuation of the rgs background is not more than 30% over the full spectral range",
    ", we assigned a systematic error of 30% to the rgs background . in reality , the emission from the centaurus cluster exceeds the background by more than an order of magnitude over the interested spectral range ; therefore , the background uncertainties have little effects on the results .",
    "figure  [ fig : rawpspec ] shows the pn spectra of the centaurus cluster , obtained by accumulating the on - source events over a series of concentric annular regions centered on the ngc  4696 nucleus (  [ subsub : epic_process ] ) , and then subtracting the background described in  [ subsub : epic_bkgd ] .",
    "the radii defining these annuli are given in the figure caption .",
    "the figure also shows their ratios to those averaged over an outer region of @xmath59 , where the cool component is hardly seen .",
    "the spectra from these regions do not bear strong atomic lines except the fe - k line at @xmath60 kev , and their spectral shapes are very similar to one another .",
    "therefore , these regions at @xmath61 must be filled with an approximately isothermal hot plasma .",
    "the figure also confirms correct background subtraction , because wrong subtraction would make the hardest - band ( @xmath62 kev ) spectra significantly depend on the radius .    toward the center , in contrast",
    ", we can see prominent increases in the line intensities ; the fe - k line enhancement is caused by the metallicity increase , while those of si - k ( at rest - frame energies of 1.86 and 2.01 kev ) , s - k ( 2.46 and 2.62 kev ) , and fe - l ( @xmath19 kev ) lines are mainly due to the emergence of the cool component .    at the very central region ( @xmath63 ) , hereafter called `` cd region '' , fe - l lines with energies below 1  kev become prominent , indicating the presence of a still cooler plasma with a temperature of @xmath64  kev .",
    "the same inference can be obtained from the drastic increases in the h - like to he - like intensity ratios of the si - k and s - k lines .",
    "we therefore qualitatively reconfirm the _",
    "detection of the coolest ( @xmath2 kev in temperature ) component at the center  @xcite .",
    "applying the procedure described in ",
    "[ subsub : depro ] to the spectra in figure  [ fig : rawpspec ] , we derived deprojected spectra from 11 concentric shells .",
    "some of them are presented in figure  [ fig : rawdspec ] , in comparison with the non - deprojected spectra .",
    "the deprojection obviously degrades the data statistics , but does not alter the spectral shape very much ; the only eye - catching difference is the reduction in the hard x - ray ( @xmath65 kev ) flux of the innermost spectra ( denoted [ cd ] ) , caused by the removal of contributions from the foreground / background hot emission .",
    "as first - cut evaluation of the annular spectra of figure  [ fig : rawpspec ] , we conducted a conventional single - temperature analysis .",
    "this is meant to approximate 1p conditions , but only crudely , because three effects , coupled with the temperature and abundance gradients , would make each spectrum deviate from an exact isothermality ; the most dominant one is the projection effects , while the less important ones are the finite angular resolution of the x - ray telescope which mixes up signals from adjacent shells , and the finite thickness of each annulus .",
    "thus , the single - temperature representation should be regarded as a crude approximation here .",
    "we fitted the three projected epic spectra from each annulus with a single - temperature apec model  @xcite with photoelectric absorption , simultaneously but allowing the model normalization to differ among the three detectors .",
    "the abundances of o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , fe , and ni were all left free , while those of c and n were fixed at the solar values by @xcite .",
    "the redshift was fixed at 0.0104 , and the hydrogen column density at the galactic - line - ofsight value , @xmath66  @xmath7 , because @xcite found the absorption to be grossly consistent with it .",
    "since some systematic residuals were observed around the fe - k line region , we incorporated small gain correction factors , + 0.3% to pn , + 0.6% to mos1 , and + 0.3% to mos2 , all within the reported calibration uncertainties .",
    "these improved the fit chi - squared , without significantly affecting the best - fit parameters .    as expected from figure  [ fig : rawpspec ]",
    ", fits to the cd region spectra left large residuals around the fe - l energies .",
    "we therefore added , in these cases , another cool apec component with a temperature ( left free ) of @xmath2 kev , of which the abundances are tied to that of the major component . as a result",
    ", the fits were much improved , in agreement with the report by @xcite .",
    "this modeling should be distinguished from the 2p approach to be examined later .",
    "the 1p model ( plus the 0.7 kev component ) reproduced the spectra moderately well , although the fits are not necessarily acceptable .",
    "figure  [ fig:1prad ] ( filed circles ) shows radial profiles of the obtained parameters .",
    "thus , the plasma temperature approaches a constant value of @xmath67  3.8  kev toward outer regions , while drops inside @xmath68 , in agreement with the inference from figure  [ fig : rawpspec]b and with the previous results ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as mentioned above , the @xmath2 kev plasma component was needed at @xmath69 .    in figure  [ fig:1prad ] , the abundances of fe and",
    "si are seen to increase toward the center as first revealed with _",
    "@xcite , while that of oxygen is spatially rather constant .",
    "these results are consistent with the single - temperature analysis results from @xcite . although @xcite reported a _",
    "_ detection of a metallicity decrease within @xmath70 ( down to @xmath71  solar at @xmath72 ) , such an effect , if any , is less significant in the epic data .",
    "we performed the same model fitting to the deprojected spectra .",
    "since the spectra are now free from the projection effects , the single - temperature modeling is equivalent to 1p conditions , assuming that each deprojected shell is thin enough and the signal mixing due to the telescope response is negligible .",
    "this analysis yielded the data points represented in figure  [ fig:1prad ] by open diamonds .",
    "thus , the overall results are very similar to those obtained with the annular spectra .",
    "the fits became generally better , due to the reduced statistics of the deprojected spectra , and to the removal of fore- and background contributions .",
    "the latter also makes the deprojected temperatures systematically lower ( typically by 0.30.5 kev ) than the non - deprojected values .      as an alternative approach",
    ", we fitted the epic spectra by a 2p model , i.e. , a sum of two apec components with different temperatures , plus the @xmath2  kev component at @xmath73 . for each annulus ,",
    "the cool component temperature @xmath11 was left free , while the abundance of each element was assumed to be the same among the components .",
    "like in the 1p analysis  (  [ subsub : ana1p ] ) , the c and n abundances were fixed ; so were the redshift and the photoelectric absorption .",
    "when we first let the hot component temperature @xmath9 float as well , it became rather unconstrained in some outer regions , and scattered over a range of @xmath74 to @xmath37 kev .",
    "this is due to coupling with @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "however , the value was generally consistent , within rather large errors , with 3.84.0 kev obtained in past observations .",
    "we hence fixed it at @xmath75  kev after the _ asca _ results  @xcite and our 1p fits  ( figure  [ fig:1prad ] ) .    by this 2p model ,",
    "both the non - deprojected and deprojected spectra were reproduced reasonably well in all regions .",
    "the obtained parameters , shown in figure  [ fig:2prad ] , are generally consistent with the two - temperature results by @xcite within some differences in the modeling .",
    "thus , the fit goodness is comparable to , or slightly better than , those obtained with the 1p analysis .",
    "the derived abundance profiles are essentially the same as the 1p results , and the radial profile of fe ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2prad]c ) agrees very well with the _ asca _ 2p results @xcite .",
    "the temperature differences between the projected and non - deprojected spectra became smaller than in the 1p analysis , and often insignificant within errors .",
    "this is consistent with a 2p condition , in which an annulus and the corresponding deprojected shell are expected to share nearly the same two temperatures .",
    "figure  [ fig : vfill]a shows radial profiles of the emission measures ( per unit volume ) of the hot and cool components , denoted @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "thus , the cool component is required within @xmath78 , where the 1p temperature decreases significantly in our 1p result ( figure  [ fig:1prad ] ) .",
    "the derived @xmath11 stays at @xmath36 kev over @xmath79 ( though rather poorly determined outside @xmath80 ; figure  [ fig:2prad]a ) , while it decreases down to @xmath81 kev at the center .",
    "the latter agrees with the central 1p temperature from our 1p fits ( figure  [ fig:1prad ] ) and from _ rosat _  @xcite . at the cd region ,",
    "the third 0.7 kev component is again required .",
    "in contrast , neither the ring - sorted spectra nor the deprojected thin - shell ones required the cool component in regions outside @xmath78 .",
    "accordingly , figure  [ fig:2prad ] outside @xmath78 simply reproduces the 1p results .",
    "incidentally , the 2p analyses of the _ asca _ data yielded somewhat lower values of @xmath11 ; @xmath19 kev @xcite , or @xmath82  kev  @xcite .",
    "this is partially because _ asca _ was not able to separately detect the 0.7  kev component .",
    "the remaining difference may be due to the different plasma codes @xcite , the mekal and apec codes used in the _ asca _ study and the present analysis , respectively .    to characterize the obtained 2p solution , let us introduce , after @xcite , the volume filling factor @xmath83 of the cool phase . using the emission measures , this quantity is defined as @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the densities of the hot and cool phases , respectively , while @xmath87 is a factor of order unity reflecting the metallicity . assuming a pressure balance between the two phases  @xcite , namely , @xmath88 we can calculate @xmath83 as @xmath89^{-1}. \\label{eq : filling_factor}\\ ] ] figure  [ fig : vfill]b shows the radial profile of @xmath83 , thus calculated using eq.([eq : filling_factor ] ) ; in deriving this result , we fixed @xmath11 at 2.0 kev in shell regions outside @xmath90",
    ". the figure reconfirms the _ asca _ results @xcite , that the hot phase dominates the volume down to a radius rather close ( @xmath91 or 18  kpc ) to the center .",
    "the filling factor implied by the _ xmm - newton _ data is higher by a factor of @xmath74 than the _ asca _ determination ; as can be understood via eq.([eq : filling_factor ] ) , this is due partially to the higher value of @xmath11 .      as we have seen in ",
    "[ sub : epic_ana ] , the two descriptions , 1p and 2p , are consistent with each other in the sense that both find essentially the same set of three plasma temperatures , @xmath92 kev , 1.72.0 kev , and @xmath2 kev .",
    "outside @xmath93 ( @xmath94 kpc ) , the icm can be approximated as isothermal at @xmath92  kev . within @xmath93 toward the cluster core , the icm becomes gradually cooler down to @xmath36 kev ( if employing the 1p description ) , or the @xmath36 kev plasma becomes intermixed with the hot 3.8 kev component with a progressively larger @xmath83 ( if employing the 2p description ) . in the cd region ,",
    "both scenarios require the additional 0.7  kev plasma . up to this stage , we are unable to tell which of the two approaches is more favored by the data .",
    "although the 2p fit to the deprojected spectra often gives a slightly lower reduced chi - squared than the 1p fit ( figure  [ fig:1prad]b vs. figure  [ fig:2prad]b ) , the difference is not necessarily statistically significant , and could be due to the finite temperature gradient within each shell .      in order to better distinguish the 1p and 2p modelings under higher statistics , we took the deprojected spectra from consecutive five thin shells covering altogether @xmath95 ( [ e ] though [ i ] in figure [ fig : rawpspec ] ) , which have 1p temperatures of 2.03 , 2.48 , 2.65 , 3.10 , and 3.30 kev respectively (  [ subsub : ana1p ] ) .",
    "we then summed them into a single spectrum which now represents a thicker 3-dimensional shell in the cool core region ; this is hereafter called `` shell c '' .",
    "the cd region , together with the  plume \" structure , is excluded to avoid complexity introduced by the 0.7  kev component .",
    "since the statistical errors associated with the adjacent thin - shell spectra are not mutually independent , we estimated the errors to be assigned to the thick - shell spectra by properly considering error propagation utilizing eq.([eq : deprojection])@xcite .",
    "the shell  c spectra , one for each detector , should contain the 3.8 kev component if the 2p scenario is correct .",
    "if instead the 1p picture is more appropriate , the shell  c spectra would rule out contributions from such a high temperature component , because the 1p temperature changes across shell  c from 2.0 kev to 3.3 kev but not higher ( figure [ fig:1prad ] ) .",
    "we expect that the improved data statistics , achieved by the spectral summation , allow us to distinguish these two cases .",
    "in addition to the improved statistics , analyzing a thick shell has two more advantages : the signal mixing caused by the finite telescope resolution is reduced , and the errors due to spectral changes within individual thin shells , if any , nearly cancel out . as an instructive exercise of the latter effect ,",
    "let us assume , for example , the 3rd and 4th annuli constituting shell  c to have a difference by @xmath96 in their fe - k line equivalent widths , and examine what would happen if we artificially assigned the two annuli with a same value @xmath97 that is the emission - measure - weighted average between the two shells .",
    "this exaggerates the procedure of averaging out a radial spectral change over a finite shell thickness .",
    "the errors caused by the averaging are expected to propagate through deprojection into the 1st through 4th thin shells . however , as shown in appendix a , a mathematical estimate using actual matrix elements of eq.([eq : deprojection ] ) confirms that the errors in the four thin shells roughly cancel out , and hence the final thick shell - c spectrum suffers in the present case no larger errors in the line equivalent width than @xmath98 . since the same estimate applies to a temperature gradient , which is at most @xmath99 in each thin shell ( figure [ fig:1prad ] ) over @xmath100 , the residual temperature errors in the shell c spectrum are estimated to be at most @xmath101 , and hence negligible .",
    "let us examine the shell  c spectra against the 1p view .",
    "we hence took the best - fit single - temperature apec model for each of the 5 constituent thin shells , and convolved it with a response of each detector that is weighted by the surface brightness of the projection of the relevant thin shell . in the same way as the actual thick - shell data",
    ", we then summed up the 5 simulated thin - shell spectra of each detector into a single one , to be called `` synthetic 1p spectrum '' .",
    "figure [ fig : regccmpr]a directly compares these synthetic 1p spectra with the actual shell  c spectra of the corresponding detectors .",
    "thus , we observe a moderately good agreement , but the actual shell  c spectra exhibit some excess above the synthetic 1p model toward higher energies .",
    "in fact , their difference , in terms of chi - squared summed over the three detectors ( pn , mos1 and mos2 ) , becomes @xmath102 as summarized in table  [ tbl : chisquares ] .    the data vs. model comparison in figure [ fig : regccmpr]a incorporates no adjustment , since the synthetic 1p spectra are uniquely specified by the best - fit models describing the 5 constituent thin shells (  [ subsub : ana1p ] ) .",
    "however , the agreement might be improved by adjusting the model parameters .",
    "we therefore allowed to vary freely the normalizations of the five apec components which constitute the synthetic 1p spectrum .",
    "then , the agreement ( now to be called `` a fit '' ) was improved to @xmath103 ( table  [ tbl : chisquares ] ) ; the normalizations of the five components changed by a factor of 1.65 , 0.25 , 0.84 , 1.10 , and 1.26 in the increasing order of the temperature , while the summed normalization remained unchanged within @xmath104 .",
    "thus , the coolest and hottest of the five components tend to be enhanced , implying a 2p - like condition . to retain a stable fit convergence ,",
    "we did not attempt to let the 5 temperatures float .      in order to next examine the 2p approach , we fitted the actual shell  c spectra with a sum of two apec models , exactly in the same manner as in  [ subsub : ana2p ] ; the two temperatures and the two normalizations were left free , as were the abundances of o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , fe , and ni which are assumed to be common to the two components . the relative normalizations among the 3 detectors were left free as before . as a result , the degree of freedom decreased by 15 compared to the synthetic 1p modeling .",
    "the two components were convolved with the same response , weighted by the x - ray surface brightness .    as shown in figure  [ fig : regccmpr]b and table  [ tbl : chisquares ] , the obtained fit ( @xmath105 ) is significantly better than that with the synthetic 1p model , even considering the reduced degree of freedom .",
    "in fact , the high energy excess , observed in figure  [ fig : regccmpr]a , has been reduced in figure  [ fig : regccmpr]b .",
    "the two temperatures have been obtained as @xmath106  kev and @xmath107  kev . while these values agree well with the 2p results from the individual thin shells ( figure  [ fig:2prad ] ) , the obtained @xmath9 is significantly higher than the temperature range ( up to 3.30 kev , with a typical error of @xmath108 kev ) involved in the 1p description of shell  c ( figure  [ fig:1prad ] ) .",
    "although the error ranges associated with the derived @xmath109 and @xmath11 are somewhat ( typically by @xmath110 ) under - estimated due to rather large values of the reduced chi - squared ( @xmath111 ) , the above inference remains valid even if the error ranges are enlarged by @xmath110 .    just for consistency , we applied in the same way the 2p fit to the synthetic 1p spectra , to which poissonian noise was added .",
    "this yielded @xmath112 kev and @xmath113 kev , although the associated errors are rather difficult to estimate .",
    "these two temperatures are both contained within the 1p temperature distribution across shell  c ( figure  [ fig:1prad ] ) , from 2.03 kev to 3.30 kev , that we employed in constructing the synthetic 1p spectra .",
    "this difference between the actual shell  c spectrum and the sythetic 1p spectrum suggests that the hot 3.8 kev component was already present in the 5 thin - shell spectra , and has become more significant by the spectral summation .    in the above 2p fit to the actual shell  c spectra",
    ", the two components were treated to have the same abundances , and were convolved with the same response .",
    "however , the true 2p condition would be somewhat different , since the cool component , more weighted toward the metal - enriched inner regions than the hot one , must have higher abundances when averaged over shell  c. to better express this condition , we returned to the original best - fit 2p models to the five thin - shell spectra , convolved them with projected responses of the respective thin shells , and summed the results over the 5 shells .",
    "these simulated data , involving two fixed temperatures ( 2.0 and 3.8 kev ) and properly considering the radial abundance changes , are to be called `` synthetic 2p spectra '' , because they are constructed exactly in the same way as their 1p counterparts .",
    "although these synthetic 2p spectra do not involve any adjustable free parameter , they have reproduce the shell  c spectra with @xmath114 , even better than the above 2p fit , and also than the synthetic 1p modeling .      from the statistical viewpoint , even the synthetic 2p simulation obtained in ",
    "[ subsub : thick_shell_2p ] does not give an acceptable reproduction of the data ( table  [ tbl : chisquares ] ) .",
    "this hampers correct error evaluations , and makes it difficult to quantitatively compare different modelings . in figure",
    "[ fig : regccmpr ] , fit residuals are observed around strong emission lines , such as si - k , s - k , and ar - k .",
    "therefore , the inadequate fit goodness is likely to be caused mainly by subtle calibration inaccuracy in reproducing the detailed line profiles , rather than model inappropriateness . under the higher data statistics ,",
    "the calibration uncertainties presumably exceeded the systematic errors of 2% already assigned in ",
    "[ subsub : syserr ] .",
    "although our data analysis utilized rather old sas version ( 5.4.1 ) , a reanalysis of a few representative spectra from the central region , using an updated version 7.0.0 sas software ( processing and responses ) , showed rather insignificant improvements of these problems .",
    "furthermore , the fitting results derived with the two versions agreed within errors . accordingly",
    ", we retain the version 5.4.1 analysis , and assigned 5% of the source counts as a new systematic errors to the whole energy range , and repeated the overall analyses .",
    "this procedure is meant to make the fit acceptable when using the model that is best preferred by the data , and to make securer the distinction among different models .    by this error renormalization ,",
    "the values of @xmath115 have reduced appreciably , while the radial profiles of various plasma parameters remained unchanged .",
    "specifically , the comparison of the shell  c spectra with the remade synthetic spectra gives @xmath116 and 381 for 1p and 2p , respectively , both with @xmath117 ( table [ tbl : chisquares ] ) .",
    "the latter is statistically acceptable , and gives a chi - squared which is smaller by 30 than the former .",
    "thus , the 2p modeling of the shell  c spectra is statistically superior to the 1p one .      in a similar way",
    ", we derived epic spectra from another thick shell , called shell  p , which sums up three consecutive thin shells covering @xmath118 .",
    "this shell  p is peripheral to the central cool region .",
    "the summed shell  p spectra were then compared with the corresponding synthetic 1p and 2p spectra , constructed in the same manner as before from the best - fit solutions to the 3 constituent thin shells .",
    "the comparison of the actual spectra with the synthetic 1p and 2p spectra gave @xmath119 and 496 ( without the error renormalization ) , respectively , both with @xmath117 .",
    "the difference in chi - squared , though smaller than in the shell  c case , amounts to 15 , and remains @xmath120 even when the systematic error is renormalized as in  [ subsub : renormalize ] .",
    "we also fitted the shell  p spectra with the 2p model , in the same way as for the shell  c case but fixing @xmath9 at 3.8  kev as we did in  [ subsub : ana2p ] .",
    "we then obtained @xmath121  kev , together with @xmath122 .",
    "this value of @xmath11 again agrees with those obtained by the 2p fits to the constituent thin - shell spectra ( figure  [ fig:2prad ] ) , while it is significantly below the distribution of the 1p temperature across shell p , 3.03.5  kev ( figure  [ fig:1prad ] ) .",
    "therefore , the cool ( @xmath67  2.0  kev ) component is inferred to be present even in this relatively outer region . as a consistency check , we fitted the synthetic 1p spectra in shell p with the same 2p model , and obtained @xmath123  kev which agrees with the input 1p temperature range .",
    "we have so far found that the two sets of thick - shell spectra both prefer the 2p view to the 1p scenario . however , the results could be subject to various artifacts .",
    "an immediate suspect is that the appearance of the hot component in shell  c is an artifact caused by insufficient background subtraction .",
    "however , this would not explain the presence of the cool component in shell p. furthermore , the constant spectral shape in @xmath124 (  [ subsub : epic_spec ] ; figure  [ fig : rawpspec ] ) argues against this possibility . for a more quantitative examination , we remade the deprojected spectra with the background artificially under - subtracted , by 3% which is comparable to the background systematic errors estimated in  [ sub : epic ] .",
    "in fact , this little affected the results obtained so far : a comparison of the remade shell  c spectra with the 2p synthetic spectra (  [ subsub : thick_shell_2p ] ) gives nearly the same @xmath115 as before , changing only by @xmath67  2 .",
    "thus , our results are robust against the background uncertainty .",
    "another concern is possible deviations from the so - far assumed spherically symmetry .",
    "indeed , the icm temperature of the centaurus cluster exhibits significant non - axi - symmetric distributions   @xcite .",
    "then , even if the icm were in a 1 t condition , shell c would sample a wider range of temperatures , to mimic a 2 t condition .",
    "however , as far as we consider an annular region of @xmath125 that is crucial to this issue , the icm temperature ( approximated as 1 t ) is azimuthally constant typically within @xmath126 @xcite . to examine this issue using the present data , we derived a temperature map , presented in figure  [ fig : tmap ] , by analyzing the projected epic spectra in four sectors by a single - temperature model .",
    "it reconfirms a mild temperature decrease from northwest to southeast directions , with an amplitude comparable to those measured previously . according to a simple estimation , a temperature variation of this amount is insufficient , by at least a factor of two , to explain the difference between the two values of @xmath106  kev and @xmath127 kev , obtained via the 2 t fit to the shell  c spectrum and its synthetic 1 t data , respectively .",
    "thus , the preference for the 2 t view remains intact .",
    "the finite angular resolution of the _ xmm - newton _ x - ray telescope could also blur the shell  c boundary , and cause contaminations by signals from the outer hotter region .",
    "however , shell  c is much thicker ( @xmath128 ) than the blurring width ( @xmath129 ) , and the surface brightness decreases outwards . as a result",
    ", the contamination of the outer hotter emission into shell  c is estimated to be at most @xmath104 , which is within the renormalized systematic uncertainty of 5% introduced in   [ subsub : renormalize ] .    in the deprojection process (   [ subsub : depro ] ) , we assumed the region outside @xmath50 ( 150 kpc ) to have a constant spectrum that is identical to that measured just inside it .",
    "this is based on the fact that the azimuthally - averaged icm temperature of this cluster , measured with the _ asca _ gis utilizing its wide field of view and low background , is essentially constant at @xmath130 kev from @xmath131 up to @xmath132 ( 0.5 mpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . of course ,",
    "deviations from this assumption would in principle affect , via eq.([eq : deprojection ] ) , the deprojected spectrum in every shell .",
    "however , our numerical estimate in appendix a indicates that the emission from the @xmath133 region contributes only @xmath134 to the shell c spectrum , and hence any realistic error associated to it is considered negligible .",
    "furthermore , the icm temperature has been confirmed in many clusters to decrease beyond @xmath135 times the virial radius ( e , g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or @xmath136 mpc in the present case .",
    "then , we are likely to be overestimating the outermost icm temperature , and hence over - subtracting the hot ( 3.8 kev ) emission as foreground and background contributions .",
    "this makes our argument simply more conservative .",
    "a more difficult issue is asymmetry along the line of sight .",
    "if the object has a prolate shape in the depth direction , the deprojected shell  c spectra would sample effectively outer ( hence hotter ) regions , and would involve the 3.8 kev component even if it is in a 1p condition . similarly , an oblate 1p condition would make shell  p sample the cool emission .",
    "however , neither case can explain the two thick shells simultaneously .    finally in   [ subsub : thick_shell_spec ] ,",
    "possible spectral changes within each thin shell was already shown to become negligible through the construction of thick shells . as an overall confirmation to address this issue , in appendix b",
    "we have numerically simulated a 1p cluster , and analyzed the fake data in the same manner as for the actual data .",
    "then , the simulated shell c spectra have been reproduced by the 1p view , without demanding the 2p formalism . as a logical contraposition , the preference of the 2p modeling by the actual data demands the actual object not to be in the 1p condition .    from these examinations , we conclude that the data favor the presence of the hot @xmath92  kev component in the 3-dimensional core region ( @xmath95 ) , and the cool @xmath137 kev component in the peripheral region ( @xmath118 ) . in other word , the 2p picture is considered to describes the actual physical state better than the 1p view .      at the center of the centaurus cluster ,",
    "some previous works reported the presence of excess x - ray absorption , up to a few times @xmath138 cm@xmath13 ( depending on the modeling ) , above the galactic column @xcite ; this was taken as evidence for the cf .",
    "however , the effect was not confirmed in other works @xcite .",
    "likewise , we have here experienced no problems in our spectral analysis with the absorption fixed at the galactic value .",
    "generally , a somewhat higher absorption is often derived when a two- ( or multi- ) temperature emission is fitted with a 1p model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , some of the previously reported excess column densities in the centaurus cluster considerably exceed such modeling uncertainties .",
    "we examined this issue using the non - deprojected and deprojected spectra from regions within @xmath23 and @xmath140 of the center , respectively .",
    "specifically , we refitted these epic data using the 2p plus 0.7 kev model , applying an intrinsic absorption factor to both components in addition to that due to the galactic column .",
    "( the hot component can be neglect here . ) as a result , the fits were little improved in either case .",
    "the obtained _ excess _ column density in the rest frame is @xmath141  @xmath7 for the non - deprojected spectra within @xmath23 , and @xmath142  @xmath7 for the deprojected spectra within @xmath140 .",
    "these are significantly lower than the previously claimed values , @xmath143  @xmath7 , and the case of the deprojected spectrum is consistent with no excess absorption .",
    "then , what is responsible for this discrepancy ?    regardless of the modeling ( 1p or 2p ) , the _ xmm - newton _ data reveal that oxygen in the central region is deficient relative to iron and silicon (  [ subsub : ana1p ] ,  [ subsub : ana2p ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the previous works usually assumed metals in the icm to obey the solar abundance ratios , simply because of inadequate energy resolution .",
    "this presumably caused data deficits around the oxygen line ( @xmath144 kev ) relative to the model predictions , and forced previous investigators to introduce an artificial excess absorption in an attempt to suppress the over - predicted o - k line flux in their models .",
    "actually , if we constrain the icm to follow the solar abundance ratios , the present data clearly require an excess absorption by @xmath145  @xmath7 , although the fit becomes worse ( with @xmath146 ) compared to the case of the galactic absorption and free abundance ratios ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "thus , the reported excess absorption in the centaurus cluster is considered an artifact , caused mainly by the non - solar abundance ratios around the cd galaxy .",
    "because the surface brightness of the centaurus cluster is strongly peaked at the center , we can utilized the rgs data to better constrain the temperature structure of the icm in the cd region , although the available spatial information is limited to 1-dimensional projections .",
    "we extracted the first and second order spectra from rgs1 and rgs2 , over a strip of @xmath148 in width centered on the ngc  4696 nucleus .",
    "the cross - dispersion direction is at a position angle of @xmath149 , so that the data accumulation strip partially covers the plume .",
    "the background was subtracted as described in ",
    "[ sub : rgsana ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : rgs]a shows the obtained rgs spectrum , which combines the 1st and 2nd order spectra from the two rgs units . although the energy resolution is somewhat degraded due to the finite angular extent of the source , we clearly observe many atomic emission lines . in particular , the spectrum bears a strong k - line at @xmath150     from h - like oxygen ions ( oviii ) , but lacks those from he - like ones ( ovii ) which would be emitted strongly at about 22     by plasmas with a temperature lower than 0.3  kev .",
    "this indicates that the cluster core region is devoid of such very cool plasmas , contrary to the prediction by the cf hypothesis .",
    "since we already know that at least two plasma temperatures ( 0.7 kev and 1.72.0 kev ) are required to reproduce the emission from the cd region , we fitted the rgs spectra with a simple 2p plasma emission model ; we hereafter call this particular modeling `` quasi-2p fit '' , because it indeed invokes two apec components but the employed temperatures are different from those composing the 2p model employed in ",
    "[ subsub : ana2p ] and  [ sub : thick_shell ] .",
    "the four spectra ( 1st- and 2nd - order spectra from rgs1 and rgs2 ) were prepared separately , and fitted jointly .",
    "we neglected for the moment the hot ( 3.8 kev ) component , because its high temperature and large angular extent make low - energy lines rather weak , and hence its parameters are difficult to constrain with the rgs data .",
    "the abundances of o , ne , mg , si , fe , and ni were left free , but constrained to be common between the two components .",
    "after the epic results @xcite , we fixed the s , ar , and ca abundances at 1.7 , 1.5 , and 2.4  solar , respectively , because k - lines of these elements are outside the rgs wavelength range .",
    "the absorption is assumed to be galactic , as confirmed in  [ sub : excess ] . to deal with the spatial extent , we blurred each spectral component with a gaussian of a free width @xmath151 .",
    "the quasi-2p fit to the rgs spectra is shown in panels ( b ) and ( c ) of figure  [ fig : rgs ] , and the obtained parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : rgsfit ] .",
    "thus , the overall emission - line features have been reproduced to a reasonable extent .",
    "although the fit is not yet fully acceptable , this is mainly due to some unessential factors , such as our simple spectral blurring , the projection effects , and calibration uncertainties .",
    "the obtained two temperatures , 0.8  kev and 1.7  kev , agree well with the lowest two characteristic values measured with the epic from the cd region .",
    "the gaussian widths of the 0.8  kev and 1.7  kev components , @xmath152 and @xmath153 respectively , can be understood as reflecting the angular extent of the @xmath2 kev and @xmath154 kev component detected with the epic .",
    "the rgs - determined abundances of mg , si , and fe are lower by a factor of @xmath36 than the values obtained with the epic data .",
    "the discrepancy is at least partially relaxed by considering the hot  ( 3.8  kev ) component , which does not emit prominent lines , but is estimated to contribute to the continuum up to 30% and reduce equivalent widths of the lines by that amount .",
    "the remaining abundance discrepancy could be due to the abundance drop at the very center @xcite . in any case",
    ", the temperatures , determined primarily by the line intensity ratios , are not affected .",
    "the rgs spectra may be examined for the presence of other temperature components , besides the @xmath155 kev and 1.7  kev ones constituting the quasi-2p fit .",
    "the rgs spectra were therefore analyzed with the multi - temperature fit procedure of @xcite , which is a kind of differential emission measure analysis like those in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "specifically , we prepared seven plasma emission components of which the temperatures are given as @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , .. , and @xmath159 , with @xmath156 being the lowest temperature .",
    "we then allowed to vary the normalizations of the seven components , as well as @xmath156 to which the remaining 6 temperatures scale .",
    "the abundances of o , ne , mg , si , fe , and ni were left free , but constrained to be common among the seven components . each spectral component was blurred with a gaussian , of which the width is left free but constrained to be less than @xmath160 as obtained in the previous fit  ( table  [ tab : rgsfit ] ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : rgsdem ] , the best fit model obtained from this analysis is physically very close to that obtained with the quasi-2p model .",
    "the fit has been improved little ( @xmath161 ; cf .",
    "table  [ tab : rgsfit ] ) by considering extra temperature components , with only the two components ( @xmath155  kev and 1.7  kev ) remaining significant .",
    "note that these two temperatures are constrained to have a ratio of 1.5@xmath162 , while their absolute values are left free .",
    "the 1.1  kev component has turned out to be weak in contrast to the two adjacent ones , implying that the significantly detected two components are discrete entities rather than representing a continuous temperature distribution .",
    "the 2.55 kev component is not significant , either .",
    "the rgs results constrain the 3.8 ( = @xmath163 ) kev component to have an emission measure which is @xmath164 of that of the 1.7 kev component . employing eq.([eq : filling_factor ] ) , the volume filling factor of this component is then estimated as @xmath165^{-1 } = 0.6 $ ] ( or equivalently @xmath166 ) .",
    "this is consistent with figure  [ fig : vfill ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : rgsdem ] also reconfirms that any cool emission below 0.7  kev is insignificant .",
    "the upper limits are by more than an order of magnitude below the prediction of the isobaric cf model @xcite , if the model normalization is adjusted to the data at 1.7 kev .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the icm around ngc  4696 is not cooling to temperatures much below @xmath2 kev . analyzing the rgs data from the present and an additional 110 ks observation",
    ", @xcite also confirmed that the emission measure from the central region decreases more steeply toward lower temperatures than in a simple cf picture .",
    "we analyzed the _ xmm - newton _ epic data of the central region ( @xmath167 or @xmath168 kpc ) of the centaurus cluster , assuming a spherical symmetry .",
    "the icm has been characterized by three representative temperatures ; @xmath169 kev , @xmath170 found within @xmath93 ( 75  kpc ) , and @xmath2 kev localized within @xmath171 ( 12  kpc ) of the center .",
    "the values of @xmath11 and @xmath9 are consistent with the _ asca _ measurements  @xcite , and satisfy eq.([eq : tcth ] ) .",
    "similarly , the detection of the 0.7 kev component reconfirms the _ chandra _ result @xcite .",
    "the rgs data from the core region reinforced the presence of these discrete temperatures , and gave tight upper limits to emission with a temperature of @xmath172 kev .",
    "as far as the deprojected thin - shell spectra are individually analyzed , the data had no preference between the 1p and 2p approaches .",
    "however , the two sets of epic spectra from 3-dimensional thicker shells have revealed that the hot component is present even in a very inner ( @xmath20 ) region , and the cool component protrudes out beyond @xmath173 (  [ sub : thick_shell ] ) .",
    "the rgs results from the cd region (   [ sub : rgsresult ] ) provides an important support to this view .",
    "@xcite found that _ xmm - newton _ spectra of the central regions of abell  1795 also prefer the 2p formalism to the 1p modeling .    in principle , the icm could be in multi - temperature conditions @xcite .",
    "since a spectrum resulting from such a superposition of a range of temperatures is rather insensitive to the way of superposing them @xcite , an apparently 2p plasma may well be in a multi - temperature condition , and vise versa , particularly when the energy resolution is not too high .",
    "indeed , the measured value of @xmath11 appears to distribute from 1.7 to 2.0 kev , depending on the radius . nevertheless , the rgs data preferred the presence of discrete temperatures , to a continuous temperature distribution (  [ sub : rgsresult ] ) .",
    "therefore , a multi - phase modeling of the icm is considered inappropriate , at least the cd region of the centaurus cluster is concerned .",
    "based on these results , we suggest that the plasmas in the central @xmath94 kpc of the centaurus cluster are better envisaged by invoking a few ( two to three ) discrete temperature components , rather than assuming a continuous radial temperature gradient or a condition of differential emission measure .",
    "these results support and extend our view of cd clusters developed with _ asca _",
    "( paper i ) .",
    "below , we adopt the 2p view as our working hypothesis .",
    "when integrated up to @xmath174 ( 150  kpc ) , the hot component , the cool component , and the 0.7 kev one have bolometric luminosities of @xmath175 erg s@xmath13 , @xmath176 erg s@xmath13 , and @xmath177 erg s@xmath13 , respectively . according to @xcite , @xmath178 increases by a factor of 2 if integrated further out to @xmath179 ( 375  kpc ) .",
    "we have determined the radial abundance profiles of fe , si and o in the icm , assuming that the different plasma components share the same abundances at a given radius .",

    "in contrast to the behavior of fe and si , the o abundance is radially more constant , implying a decrease in the o / fe ratio toward the center , in agreement with @xcite . as argued by various authors ( paper  i ;",

    "so far , a fair number of other clusters have been known to exhibit abundance profiles similar to those of the centaurus cluster , with a central increase of iron and silicon , and a flat distribution of oxygen ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these include in particular recent _ suzaku _ observations of the fornax cluster @xcite , abell  1060 @xcite , and awm  7 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the relative oxygen deficit in the cluter core region may be a common phenomenon .",
    "the present results argue against the cf scenario from several independent aspects .",
    "these include ; the lack of cooling component (  [ sub : rgsresult ] ) ; the lack of excess absorption (  [ sub : excess ] ) ; and the radial changes in the abundance ratios (  [ subsub : abundances ] ) which rule out large - scale inflows of the icm .",
    "below , we discuss the first two issues in some more details .",
    "the cf scenario relates the bolometric luminosity , @xmath180 , of a `` cooling '' portion of icm with the mass deposition rate , @xmath181 , as  @xcite @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the mean molecular weight and @xmath184 is the proton mass . by substituting the measured value of @xmath185 erg s@xmath13 (  5.1 ) into @xmath180",
    ", we obtain @xmath186  yr@xmath13 .",
    "this in itself is consistent with the previous results from _ rosat _ @xcite and _ asca _ ( paper i ) .",
    "however , we have found no evidence of emission from any plasma component with a temperature @xmath187  kev , with upper limits much tighter than the cf - predicted emission measure ( figure  [ fig : rgsdem ] ) .",
    "therefore , the cf interpretation fails to explain the strong cool emission of the centaurus cluster , as well as in other clusters ( paper  i ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the value of @xmath181 should not b e taken as an actual mass - deposition rate .",
    "we have shown in  [ sub : excess ] that the previously reported excess absorption , at the center of the centaurus cluster , is an artifact caused by the relative oxygen deficit .",
    "in fact , when the non - solar abundance ratios are properly considered , the absorption became consistent with being galactic only , with any additional column at most several times @xmath188 @xmath7 .",
    "as discussed in ",
    "[ subsub : abundances ] , the relative oxygen depletion in the cluster center appears to be a common feature .",
    "then , the excess absorption , claimed previously in many other clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , will be explained away as well . indeed , using the rgs spectra , @xcite also confirmed the lack of excess absorption from several other clusters .",
    "given these results , there is practically no evidence for the x - ray absorbing materials at least in nearby well - studied clusters .",
    "let us briefly consider the nature of the 0.7 kev component , which is localized to the cd galaxy , ngc  4696 .",
    "similar cool emission comonents are seen around other cd galaxies , including m87 in particular , but their interpretation has generally been unsettled ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "judging from the angular extent ( @xmath3 kpc ) and the bolometric luminosity ( @xmath189 erg s@xmath13 ) , this 0.7 kev component could be hot interstellar medium ( ism ) associated with the cd galaxy .",
    "its temperature is consistent with the stellar velocity dispersion of ngc  4696 , 274 km s@xmath13 .",
    "the plasma emitting this component ( including both the central concentration and the plume ) has an estimated mass of a few times @xmath190  @xcite , which is also consistent with this ism interpretation .",
    "although the estimated cooling time of this plasma is as short as @xmath5 yr  @xcite , the radiative energy loss could be supported by such processes in ngc  4696 as the supernova heating ( a few times @xmath191 erg s@xmath13 ) , and the accumulation of stellar mass loss which is dynamically `` hot '' on the galaxy scale .",
    "in contrast to the above arguments , the complex filamentary morphology of this component  @xcite , including the plume like elongated tail structure , can not easily be reconciled with the hot ism interpretation , even considering interactions of the cd galaxy with the icm .",
    "similar problems with the cool gas in m87 ( the virgo cd galaxy ) were pointed out by @xcite , who showed its close association with the synchrotron radio arms .",
    "furthermore , as exploited in paper  i , the hot ism interpretation could be applied better to the cool ( 2 kev ) component . considering these",
    ", the 0.7 kev plasma could alternatively be associated with some magnetic structures around the cd galaxy , which in turn could be a result of past nuclear activity in ngc  4696 .",
    "further discussion of this issue is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the successful 2p picture (  [ sub : thick_shell ] ,  [ subsub:2tvs1 t ] ) and the absence of significant cfs (  [ subsub : anticf ] ) in the centaurus cluster suggest that its core region ( within @xmath94 kpc ) hosts a cool plasma phase which is stably intermixed with the hot phase .",
    "while this reconfirms a prediction made in paper  i , it poses a series of questions to be answered ; ( i ) how such a 2p configuration is realized ; ( ii ) how the cool phase is heated against the radiative cooling ; ( iii ) how the heating and cooling be balanced in a thermally stable manner ; ( iv ) what determines the value of @xmath11 ; and ( v ) what produces the scaling of eq.([eq : tcth ] ) .",
    "below , we examine them one by one .",
    "an immediate issue associated with the 2p scenario is ( i ) how to realize such a configuration .",
    "we may suppose that the two phases are intermixed on a typical length scale of @xmath192 kpc , as indicated by various sharp structures seen in x - ray images of some clusters @xcite , including the `` cold front '' structure @xcite .",
    "then , employing the classical spitzer heat conductivity , @xmath193 where @xmath194 is the temperature in kelvin , the time scale of conductive heat exchange between the two phases would be very short , as @xmath195 @xcite .",
    "the two phases would quickly become isothermal , unless the heat conduction between them is suppressed  @xcite .",
    "the most natural way to suppress the heat conduction is to invoke magnetic fields , as argued , e.g. , by @xcite to explain the cool plasma in m87 .",
    "in fact , the icm is known to be generally magnetized to a few @xmath183 g , and the aforementioned sharp x - ray features themselves are indicative of ordered strong ( @xmath196 g ) magnetic fields @xcite . in the particular case of the centaurus cluster , a magnetic field strength up to @xmath197 g is reported from radio observations @xcite .",
    "although these field strengths are not necessarily higher than the equipartition value ( @xmath198 g ) , they are more than sufficient to completely suppress the heat transport across field lines , because the gyration radius of 4 kev thermal electrons in a 1 @xmath183 g field , @xmath5 cm , is more than 10 orders of magnitude smaller than their classical mean free path for coulomb scattering which also determines eq.([eq : conduction ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the heat conductivity along field lines may well be approximated by the spitzer value , eq.([eq : conduction ] ) , unless the field lines are highly tangled  @xcite .",
    "based on solar analogy , magnetic field lines around a cd galaxy may be classified grossly into `` open '' and `` closed '' ones @xcite , corresponding to coronal holes and coronae , respectively .",
    "this view relies only on a general and simple classification of the magnetic field - line topology , without invoking any particular magnetic configuration .",
    "then , open - field regions , connected to the outer cluster volume , must be filled with the hot - phase icm , and kept nearly isothermal by the efficient field - aligned heat conduction of eq.([eq : conduction ] ) .",
    "in contrast , closed - field domains , connected to the cd galaxy and thermally insulated from the surrounding hot phase , can take independent ( possibly lower ) temperatures of its own .",
    "in addition , the loop interior plasma is expected to be metal enriched by type ia supernovae in the cd galaxy .    from these considerations , we speculate that the plasma , filling numerous magnetic loops anchored to the cd galaxy , is observed as the cool phase of the centaurus cluster ( and of other similar objects ) . in other words ,",
    "the cool phase may be regarded as a `` magnetosphere '' associated with the cd galaxy ( paper i ; * ? ? ?",
    "the magnetic fields , while working as a thermal insulator between the two phases , need not to be as strong as the equipartition value , since the loop - interior plasma is confined primarily by external pressure from the hot phase .",
    "this `` magnetosphere '' picture was already invoked successfully in paper i to explain the _ asca _ results .    indeed , h@xmath199-emitting filamentary features",
    "are optically observed in central regions of some clusters on a spatial scale of a few to few tens kpc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the brightest of them can even be identified in some _",
    "chandra _ x - ray images  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the best example is the recent _ chandra _ result on m87 @xcite , which reveals rich filamentary structures with a typical length of 10 to 50 kpc . in the centaurus cluster as well , regions of strong magnetic fields are reported to be associated with filamentary structures that emit h@xmath199 photons and enhanced soft x - rays @xcite . while these filaments could be limb - brightened edges of bubbles blown by the active galactic nucleus of m87 @xcite , they can alternatively trace magnetic structures such as assumed there .",
    "in addition to these x - ray and radio results , magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations by @xcite , including both the radiative cooling and the field - alighned heat conduction , show the emergence of low - temperature regions along the loop - shaped magnetic field lines . from these arguments , we believe we have found a viable answer to the issue ( i ) raised at the beginning of the present section .",
    "we may assume that the cluster core region is fed with a constant heating lumiosity @xmath200 , via some mechanism to be specified later in  [ sub : heating ] .",
    "in such a case , the volume heating rate will be generally proportional to the local icm density , while the volume emissivity is obviously proportional to the density squared .",
    "therefore , denser regions would preferentially cool and become even denser , leading to a thermal instability : this is the issue ( iii ) . if , however , adopting the magnetosphere picture , the cool phase can be thermally stabilized by a built - in feedback mechanism , hereafter called rtv mechanism , originally developed by @xcite to explain quiet solar coronae .",
    "the rtv mechanism holds for a thin magnetic flux tube hydrostatically immersed in an external pressure , with the two loop footpoints anchored to a cool matter reservoir .",
    "the loop - interior plasma is assumed to be heated with a constant luminosity @xmath200 , either uniformly along the loop or at the loop summit .",
    "the deposited heat @xmath200 is assumed to flow toward the footpoints due to loop - aligned conduction of eq.([eq : conduction ] ) , and ultimately radiated away from various heights of the loop .",
    "suppose that @xmath200 was initially balanced by the radiative cooling , but some perturbation caused @xmath200 to decrease .",
    "then , the loop loses its internal pressure , and becomes thinner under the external compression , thus reducing the conductive heat flow along it . at the same time , some portion of the plasma flows into the matter reservoir , and the consequent decrease in the emission integral reduces the radiative energy loss .",
    "these concordant effects bring the loop into a new steady state corresponding to a lower value of @xmath200 .",
    "thus , the rtv mechanism thermally stabilizes the cool phase , and gives an answer to the issue ( iii ) .",
    "following the original work by @xcite , @xcite used the _ yohkoh _ spacecraft to examin the rtv mechanism .",
    "they confirmed that it is likely to be actually working in quiescent solar coronae , which keep emitting x - rays in an apparently steady manner for a time much longer than the nominal cooling time ( @xmath201 minutes ) .",
    "the rtv mechanism further allows us to answer ( iv ) , namely , to explain the absolute values of @xmath11 .",
    "let us assume that the matter reservoir at the footpoints is much cooler than the loop interior , so that heat inflow to the reservoir can be neglected .",
    "under such boundary conditions , the temperature of the loop - confined plasma is shown to take the maximum value of @xmath202 at the loop top @xcite . here , @xmath203 ( cm ) is the loop half length , and @xmath204 is the loop - confining external pressure in units of dyn @xmath7 .",
    "this is so - called rtv temperature scaling , which is actually confirmed in quiescent solar coronae @xcite .",
    "the range of the coefficient , 1.1 to 1.4 , reflects differences in the assumed heat input distribution along the loop .",
    "the index of scaling in eq.([eq : rtv1 ] ) depends weakly on the form of the cooling function @xcite ; the particular value of 1/3 is valid over a temperature range of 0.52 kev and near - solar abundances .",
    "most importantly , @xmath205 in eq.([eq : rtv1 ] ) is determined solely by the product @xmath206 , without depending on @xmath200 .",
    "the loop - ineterior density @xmath207 becomes also independent of @xmath200 , because @xmath208 is assumed to be constant .",
    "changes in @xmath200 affect only the loop cross section @xmath209 , and hence the cool - phase x - ray luminosity which is by definition equal to @xmath200 .",
    "more specifically , eq.([eq : conduction ] ) and eq.([eq : rtv1 ] ) , together with @xmath210 , can be combined into another scaling relation as @xmath211 thus , the loop becomes thicker under higher values of @xmath200 .",
    "the loop also gets thicker if we decrease @xmath204 while keeping @xmath200 constant , but in this case , @xmath205 automatically decreases via eq.([eq : rtv1 ] ) , so as to reduce the conductive heat flux ( per unit cross section ) @xmath212 and hence keep @xmath200 unchanged .    in the present case of centaurus , we may identify @xmath204 with the hot - phase pressure in the core region , namely @xmath213 dyn  @xmath7 with @xmath214 @xmath215 @xcite , and rewrite eq.([eq : rtv1 ] ) as @xmath216^{1/3 } ~~{\\rm kev}~. \\label{eq : rtv2}\\ ] ] here , we assumed that loop semi - lenght to be comparable to the narrower core radius , @xmath201 kpc , of the double-@xmath54 modeling for the gravitational potential in the centaurus cluster @xcite .",
    "this is because each magnetic loop , with its interior having a higher density than the surrounding hot phase , may not become taller than the flat core radius of the central gravitational potential .",
    "the assumed length is comparable to those of the soft x - ray filaments in m87 @xcite .",
    "when such a loop is observed as an integrated entity , we expect to measure an x - ray temperature averaged over the loop length .",
    "assuming the footpoint temperature to be 0.7 kev (  [ sub:0.7kev ] ) , a simple numerical solution to the rtv equation predicts this average to be @xmath217 , or @xmath218 kev from eq.([eq : rtv2 ] ) .",
    "this is in an excellent agreement with @xmath11 actually measured in the centaurus cluster , giving an answer to the issue ( iv ) .    in reality ,",
    "the loop length may well scatter , with longer loops tending to be hotter according to eq.([eq : rtv2 ] ) .",
    "then , we expect the spherically averaged loop temperature to slightly increase outward , because each loop is hottest at its top region , and a larger radii would sample longer loops .",
    "this agrees with what we actually observe in figure  [ fig:2prad ] .      taking it for granted that @xmath11 can be identified with @xmath217 ,",
    "let us consider the issue ( iv ) , namely , to explain the scaling of eq.([eq : tcth ] ) .",
    "the luminosity of the hot phase in a cluster is empirically known to scale with its temperature as @xmath219 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand , we generally have @xmath220 , where @xmath221 is a typical radius of the hot phase .",
    "elimination of @xmath222 from these two equations gives @xmath223 , and hence @xmath224 . substituting this into eq.([eq : rtv2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath225 assuming that @xmath226 is relatively constant , @xmath11 indeed becomes roughly proportional to @xmath9 , providing an explanation to eq.([eq : tcth ] ) .",
    "as shown so far , the rtv mechanism can account for the stable coexistence of the cool and hot phases in the cluster core region .",
    "the scenario is independent of the amount of available heat input , because a lower value of @xmath200 simply reduces the cool - phase luminosity .",
    "furthermore , the rtv scaling can quantitatively explain the absolute values of @xmath11 , as well as its ( near ) proportionality to @xmath9 expressed by eq.([eq : tcth ] ) .",
    "thus , three of the four issues raised at the beginning of  [ sub : magnetosphere ] have been answered .",
    "we therefore propose the magnetosphere model , incorporating the rtv mechanism , as a promising hypothesis to explain the plasma physics in the central regions of cd clusters in general .      to complete our new viewpoint",
    ", we may ask ourselves why the bright cool emission is observed predominantly around cd ( or xd ) galaxies ( * ? ? ? * figure 1 of paper i ) , including ngc  4649 .",
    "conversly , non - cd galaxies , like ngc  4472 in the virgo cluster , generally lack such bright cool x - ray emission , even if they are optically as luminous as their cd counterparts .",
    "an outstanding characteristic of a cd galaxy is that it is nearly in a standstill at the bottom of the gravitational potential .",
    "then , we may speculate that a substantial magnetosphere can develop around a galaxy in a cluster environment only when it is at rest with respect to the icm .",
    "when a galaxy is moving through the icm , its magnetosphere will be disrupted by the icm ram pressure , which can be one to two orders of magnitude higher than the magnetic pressure of the assumed magnetosphere ( paper i ) .",
    "such strong interactions are actually revealed by _",
    "observations in nearby clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , optical observations of distant clusters reveal numerous blue spiral galaxies with distorted morphology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which we suggest to be interacting with the icm .",
    "having answered four out of the 5 questions raised at the beginning of  [ sub : magnetosphere ] , the only remaining issue is ( ii ) , i.e. , to seek for possible heating mechanisms to sustain the cool - phase luminosity . in the case of the centaurus cluster ,",
    "the target value is @xmath227 erg s@xmath13 .",
    "after makishima ( 1997 ) , paper i , and the discussion conducted so far , we retain our magnetosphere viewpoint .    the argument in ",
    "[ subsub : interaction ] indicates that moving galaxies in a cluster interact with the icm , and transfer their kinetic energies to the icm .",
    "this process is estimated to proceed at a rate of @xmath228 @xcite , where @xmath49 is the number of moving galaxies , @xmath229 is the average icm number density , @xmath230 is the average galaxy velocity , and @xmath231 is the interaction radius for each galaxy .",
    "we may use @xmath232 km s@xmath13 which is @xmath233 times the velocity dispersion of the centaurus cluster ( 586  km s@xmath13 ) after @xcite , @xmath234 @xmath215 which is an average over the central 300 kpc @xcite , and @xmath235 .",
    "furthermore , a relatively large value of @xmath231 , say , @xmath25 kpc , is suggested by the argument in  [ subsub : interaction ] , and by some x - ray observations @xcite . through eq.([eq : interaction ] ) , these numbers yield @xmath236 erg s@xmath13 , which well exceeds @xmath237",
    "erg s@xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the galaxy - icm interaction becomes a promising candidate for the icm heating , and for the suppression of cfs .",
    "these effects have been reproduced successfully by numerical simulations @xcite .    how large is the kinetic energy @xmath238 stored in the moving galaxies ?",
    "the stellar mass of the centaurus cluster within the central 300 kpc , but excluding the cd galaxy , is estimated as @xmath239 @xcite after correcting for the different values of the hubble constant .",
    "we have then @xmath240 ergs , which is likely to be a lower limit because the employed galaxy mass assumes a conservative mass - to - light ratio of 8 . as a result",
    ", the time scale of the energy tansfer from the moving galaxies to the icm is estimated as @xmath241 yr .",
    "therefore , the kinetic energy in the moving galaxies is large enough to sustain @xmath242 over the hubble time .",
    "the galaxy - to - icm energy transfer is expected to cause galaxies to gradually fall to the potential center .",
    "there are several pieces of observational evidence suggesting that this effect is actually taking place .",
    "in fact , the stellar - mass distributions in many clusters are known to be much more centrally peaked than that of the icm . furthermore ,",
    "clear central decreases in `` iron - mass to light ratio '' , observed from a fair number of clusters and groups ( paper  i ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggest that galaxies used to be distributed more widely than today , and polluted the icm with metals out to the cluster edges .",
    "the energy released by the moving galaxies may be stored once in the icm in the form of turbulence and bulk flows . however , according to the _ suzaku _ observation @xcite , these kinetic energies in the icm of the centaurus cluster , as estimated from the width and position - dependent centroid shifts of the fe - k line , can not largely exceed its thermal energy . therefore , the turbulent and bulk - flow energies must be dissipated and thermalized efficiently in the icm , with a rate comparable to @xmath242 . if a fair fraction of the dissipated energy is deposited onto the magnetosphere , the available heating luminosity of the cool phase becomes of the order of @xmath243 erg s@xmath13 which can just sustain the observed @xmath244 .",
    "we would rather say that @xmath244 is self - adjusted , via the rtv mechanism , to match the predetermined energy dissipation rate .",
    "the remaining portion of @xmath242 will heat the hot phase , to make it spatially more extended than the total gravitating mass .",
    "the actual dissipation of turbulence and bulk - flow energies may take place through magnetohydrodynamic processes .",
    "for example , moving galaxies will pick up magnetic field lines in the icm and stretch them , exciting alfvn waves and causing field lines to reconnect .",
    "when the magnetic reconnection occurs between two closed magnetic loops , the released energy will be spent in heating the cool phase .",
    "that between closed and open field lines will expel a small potion of the metal - rich cool - phase plasma into the hot phase .",
    "the ejected plasmoid will become quickly isothermal with the hot phase , in terms of the electron temperature via eq.([eq : conduction ] ) , as well as in terms of the ion ionization temperature ( in a few times @xmath245 yr ; * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting highly ionized heavy ions will remain there due to their slow diffusion @xcite , and increase the metallicity of the hot phase .",
    "this can explain why the central metallicity increase is observed in both phases .",
    "in addition to the above mechanism , there can be another icm heating mechanism localized around each cd galaxy ; namely , a shrink of its self - gravitating core .",
    "since this has already been discussed in paper i , we simply mention that this mechanism can also account for a heating luminosity of @xmath246 erg s@xmath13 .",
    "analyzing the _ xmm - newton _ epic and rgs data of the centaurus cluster , we have obtained the following results .    1 .",
    "the icm in the central @xmath94 kpc can be described better by the two - phase view ( plus the 0.7 kev component at @xmath247 kpc ) than by the single - phase picture .",
    "2 .   there is no evidence of cooling flows .",
    "the iron and silicon abundances increases significantly in the central region , while that of oxygen is radially constant .",
    "the previously reported excess x - ray absorption disappears when the central oxygen deficit is considered .",
    "the overall results agree with those by @xcite who used _ asca _ and _ rosat_.    to explain these observations , we have developed a working hypothesis ( after paper  i ) , in which the cool phase is thought to constitute a magnetosphere associated with the cd galaxy . incorporating the rosner - tucker - vaiana mechanism , it can account for the following essential features of the centaurus cluster , as well as of similar cd clusters .    1 .   the hot and cool icm phases co - exsit in the cluster core region .",
    "the icm is provided with a heating luminosity , which is high enough to sustain the x - ray emission against the radiative cooling .",
    "the cool phase is kept thermally stable .",
    "4 .   the cool phase has a typical temperature of @xmath36 kev , with a mild outward increase .",
    "5 .   a good proportionality holds between the cool and hot temperatures",

    "another exercise to be conducted using eq.([eq : depronum ] ) is the issue raised in ",
    "[ subsub : thick_shell_spec ] , i.e. , how the assumption of emission constancy within each thin shell affects our shell c spectrum .",
    "as mentionned there , let us examine what happens if we purposely neglected spectral differences between @xmath269 and @xmath270 ( the 3rd and 4th thin shell constructing shell c , respectively ) , where the 1p properties change rather steeply with @xmath14 .",
    "taking the fe - k line equivalent width as an example ,",
    "we may write the fluxes in the fe - k line energy region as @xmath271 and @xmath272 , where @xmath273 represents continuum and @xmath274 the line equivalent width . using the difference @xmath275 and the emission - measure - weighted mean @xmath276 , we may rewrite as @xmath277 $ ] and @xmath278 $ ] . substitution of this into eq.([eq : shellcnum ] ) readily yields @xmath279 where @xmath280 represents terms unrelated to @xmath269 or @xmath270 , while @xmath281 is a numerical factor .",
    "thus , the negligence of @xmath96 between the two annular spectra has only an effect of at most @xmath98 in the shell c spectrum .",
    "the essence is that the deprojection procedure has mathematically  differential \" nature exaggerating small - scale features , while this problem is largely removed by constructing a thick shell wherein a process of integration is involved .",
    "this is evidenced by eq.([eq : shellcnum ] ) , where @xmath265 is close to a simple summation of @xmath267 through @xmath268 , except that @xmath267 must be given a 1.7 times larger weight and @xmath282 ( the shell just outside shell c ) must be subtracted with a relatively large weight of 1.5 .",
    "in order to assess the validity of our  thick shell \" method , the following numerical simulation was performed .",
    "we started from the best - fit 1p numerical models ( figure  [ fig:1prad ] ) obtained for the 13 deprojected thin shell regions which are defined in figure  [ fig : rawpspec ] .",
    "then , to represent the radial spectral changes more smoothly , each of the 5 shells constituting shell c ( covering @xmath283 ) was subdivided into inner and outer halves , and appropriate temperature and emission measure were assigned to the inner / outer pair .",
    "these model spectra , now comprising 18 shells , were projected numerically onto the corresponding 18 annuli , to form numerical spectral models for the 18 annular regions . at this stage",
    ", the inner / outer pair were numerically recombined together .",
    "the derived 13 model spectra were convolved with the epic energy responses , and were given poisson errors simulating the actual observation .",
    "then , in the same manner as the actual data , we analyzed these 13 annular spectra via deprojection .",
    "figure  [ fig : fake1p ] shows the simulated shell c spectra , compared with the ",
    "sysnthetic 1p spectra \" introduced in  [ subsub : thick_shell_1p ] .",
    "the comparison is fully satisfactory with @xmath284 . for reference ,",
    "a 2p fit with two apec components , in the same manner as explained in ",
    "[ subsub : thick_shell_2p ] , gave @xmath285 , which is similarly acceptable .",
    "in other words , the 1p and 2p interpretations degenerate unlike the case of the actual data . furthermore , unlike the 2p fit to the actual shell c spectra which revealed the @xmath286 kev component , the 2p fit to the simulated data yielded @xmath287 kev and @xmath288 kev , which are both consistent with the assumed 1p temperature range ( 2.03 to 3.30 kev ) .",
