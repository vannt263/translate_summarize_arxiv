    "in this article , we study the motion of light ( null geodesics ) in the gravitational field of two non - rotating schwarzschild black holes . in general relativity ,",
    "solutions of the field equations describing more than one purely gravitational sources are necessarily non - stationary , because gravity is always attractive ( we are not considering exotic matter ) ; there is no possibility of arbitrarily `` pinning '' sources as is done in newtonian gravitation , because of the automatic self - consistency of the nonlinear einstein s equations .",
    "if we demand that the two black holes be fixed in space , then the solution includes a conical singularity ( a `` strut '' ) lying on the axis on which the two masses are located@xcite .",
    "this singularity appears as a natural consequence of the field equations , and it is necessary to keep the two masses from falling towards each other .",
    "however , this singularity would have to be made of very exotic matter , and this solution does not describe any realistic system in astrophysics .",
    "the real solution to the relativistic two - body problem can have no conical singularities , and it is necessarily non - stationary .",
    "the two black holes will spiral around each other , emitting gravitational waves , which makes this problem even more difficult .",
    "there is no exact solution for the relativistic two - body problem , and even a numerical solution has eluded the most powerful computers .    in order to cope with this problem , contopoulos and others @xcite",
    "have used the majumdar - papetrou solution @xcite to study the dynamics of test particles in a space - time with two black holes .",
    "the majumdar - papetrou metric used by contopoulos describes two non - rotating black holes with extreme electric charge ( @xmath0 in relativistic units ) , whose gravitational pull is exactly matched by their electrostatic repulsion , thereby allowing a static mass configuration .",
    "they have found that in this metric the motion of both light and massive particles is chaotic , with a fractal invariant set and a fractal basin boundary .",
    "however , it is very unlikely that the majumdar - papetrou metric describes realistic astronomical objects , since there is no known realistic astrophysical process by which a black hole with extreme charge could be formed .",
    "even though the two black holes with extreme charge have proven useful as toy models , it is important to address the more realistic problem of two uncharged black holes .",
    "this is what we do in this article , for the motion of light and other massless particles .    in order to overcome the fact that there is no static solution for the two - black - hole system",
    ", we consider the case when the two black holes are far apart , with a distance much larger than their schwarzschild radii . in this case ,",
    "nonlinear effects in the field equations are expected to be small , and we can approximate the motion of test particles in the neighborhood of one of the masses as being the result of the field of that mass alone , and disregard the effect of the other black hole as being negligible . using this approximation ,",
    "the motion of test particles in the two - black - hole system is treated as a combination of motions caused by isolated schwarzschild black holes .",
    "since the equations of motion for the schwarzschild geometry can be analytically integrated , our dynamical system is reduced to a map , which is much easier to study than a system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "this scattering map is built in section 2 , for the simple case of two black holes with equal masses . in section 3 , we show that this map has a fractal basin boundary separating the possible outcomes of a light ray in the two - black - hole field , namely , falling into either of the black holes or escaping towards the asymptotically plane infinity .",
    "the fractal ( box - counting ) dimension of this basin boundary is numerically calculated , and the sensitivity to initial conditions implied by the fractal nature of the boundary is thereby quantified . in section 4",
    "we use explicitly the condition of large separation between the black holes . in this limit",
    ", the basin boundary becomes a self - similar cantor set , which allows us to obtain some analytical results .",
    "one of our main results is that the fractal dimension decays very slowly ( logarithmically ) with distance .",
    "the slow decay of the fractal dimension makes it more likely that the fractal nature of the basin boundary has some importance for astrophysics . in section 5",
    ", we consider the case of two black holes with unequal masses , in the limit of a large separation ; we find that the logarithmic decay law of the fractal dimension for large distances is also valid in this case . in section 6 ,",
    "we summarize our results and draw some conclusions .",
    "we begin by reviewing some basic results concerning the motion of test particles in the field of an isolated schwarzschild black hole@xcite .",
    "we consider specifically the case of null geodesics , which concerns us most , but many features of the dynamics also apply to massive particles .",
    "the schwarzschild metric is written in spherical coordinates as : @xmath1 with @xmath2 being the element of unit area , and @xmath3 is the time measured from a distant observer .",
    "@xmath4 is the black hole s mass in geometrized units .",
    "we are interested only in the region of space - time outside the event horizon , @xmath5 . due to the conservation of angular momentum , test particles move on a plane , which can be chosen as @xmath6 .",
    "the plane whereon the motion occurs is then described by the coordinates @xmath7 and @xmath8 . the geodesic equations which describe trajectories of test particles on this plane can be analytically integrated by means of elliptical functions@xcite .",
    "here we are interested in the scattering of null geodesics by the black hole .",
    "a light ray coming from infinity towards the black hole is characterized by the impact parameter @xmath9 defined by the ratio @xmath10 , where the angular momentum @xmath11 and the energy @xmath12 are constants of motion given by : @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 is the geodesic s affine parameter . for null geodesics",
    "only the ratio of @xmath11 and @xmath12 is of importance to the dynamics . in the asymptotically plane region @xmath16",
    ", @xmath9 corresponds to the usual impact parameter of classical scattering problems .    if the impact parameter is below the critical value @xmath17 , the trajectory of the light ray spirals down the event horizon and plunges into the black hole .",
    "if @xmath18 , the trajectory circles the black hole and escapes again towards infinity , being deflected by an angle @xmath19 .",
    "the lowest value @xmath20 of the radial coordinate @xmath7 along the trajectory ( the `` perihelium '' ) is given by : @xmath21 following chandrasekhar@xcite , we define the quantities @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 by : @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 the scattering angle @xmath19 is then given by @xmath28 and the function @xmath29 is : @xmath30 .\\ ] ] here @xmath31 is the jacobian elliptic integral and @xmath32 is the complete elliptic integral . in fig .",
    "1 we show a plot of @xmath33 . as @xmath9 approaches the critical value @xmath34 from above , @xmath19 goes to infinity ; trajectories with @xmath9 sufficiently near @xmath34 can circle the black hole an arbitrary number of times before escaping , and for @xmath35 , the light ray makes an infinite number of rotations , and never escapes .",
    "this is a consequence of the existence of an unstable periodic orbit at @xmath36 , which appears as a maximum in the effective potential .",
    "the orbits with @xmath35 spiral towards the @xmath36 orbit , and in the language of dynamical systems they make up the stable manifold associated with this periodic orbit .",
    "the fact that @xmath19 assumes values above @xmath37 for a non - zero range of @xmath9 implies the existence of a rainbow singularity in the scattering cross section ; this is to be contrasted with the newtonian rutherford scattering , which shows no such singularities . in fact",
    ", @xmath19 assumes arbitrarily large values , and the differential cross section at any given angle @xmath38 is made up by an infinite number of contributions arising from trajectories with @xmath39 , @xmath40 , in general @xmath41 , corresponding to trajectories that circle the black hole @xmath42 times before being scattered towards @xmath38 .",
    "however , large values of @xmath42 correspond to very low ranges of @xmath9 : the set of trajectories that scatters by @xmath43 has a measure that decreases very rapidly with @xmath42 .",
    "chandrasekhar @xcite shows that the impact parameter @xmath44 corresponding to a scattering by @xmath43 for large values of @xmath42 is given approximately by : @xmath45 this expression shows that the measure of the set of trajectories scattered by @xmath43 decays exponentially with @xmath42 , and the contribution of orbits with large @xmath42 to the cross section is small .",
    "in fact , we shall see later that in many cases it is a good approximation to consider only orbits with @xmath46 .",
    "after reviewing some properties of an isolated black hole , we now consider the case of two black holes with equal mass @xmath4 ( we consider the case of different masses in section 5 ) . as we mentioned in the introduction",
    ", there is no exact solution of einstein s field equations that describes this system . because of this ,",
    "we assume that the two black holes are separated by a distance @xmath47 much larger than their schwarzschild radius @xmath48 ; in this limit the nonlinear interaction between the two gravitational fields can be ignored . in a real system",
    ", the two black holes will be rotating around their center of mass ; however , their rotation speed is much smaller than the velocity of light .",
    "we can thus consider the two black holes to be fixed in space , without incurring in too much error .",
    "notice that this approximation might not be valid for massive test particles .",
    "we are interested in the orbits that never escape to infinity nor fall into one of the event horizons ; these orbits make up the basin boundary of the system , which will be discussed later in more detail .",
    "for the orbits not to escape , they need to have impact parameters such that they are scattered by at least @xmath37 by one of the black holes . in the case of an isolated black hole",
    ", this corresponds to an impact parameter lower than @xmath49 , which is less that three times the schwarzschild radius . since in our approximation @xmath50 , for the purpose of finding the basin boundary we can consider that the light rays are scattered by each black hole separately , the other black hole being too far away to make a significant difference in the scattering . after suffering a scattering by one of the black holes , the ray may reach the other black hole , depending on its emerging trajectory after the first scattering .",
    "it is then scattered again , and may return to the first black hole , and so on . since @xmath50 , we consider the scattering process of each black hole separately and use formulas ( [ eqdelta ] ) and ( [ eqf ] ) to determine the deflection angle due to each black hole as a function of the incident impact parameter .    by making the approximations mentioned above",
    ", we reduce the motion of light in the two - black - hole space - time to a 2-d map , as has been done in @xcite to study general features of chaotic scattering . to do this",
    ", we make the further assumption that the light rays have zero angular momentum in the direction of the axial symmetry axis , on which lie the two black holes ; the orbits are then confined to a plane containing the two black holes . due to the axial symmetry of the system , the motions on all such planes are similar .",
    "now suppose we have a light ray escaping from one of the black holes with impact parameter @xmath44 and with an escaping angle @xmath51 with respect to the symmetry axis , as shown schematically in figure 2 . since the black holes are considered to be very far apart , the impact parameter @xmath52 of the light ray with respect to the other black hole is the segment @xmath53 shown in figure 2 ( one black hole can be considered to be `` at infinity '' as regards the other ) .",
    "we use the convention that positive values of @xmath9 means that the ray is directed to the right side of the black hole , and rays with negative @xmath9 are directed to the left . from elementary geometry",
    ", we have @xmath54 .",
    "the deflection angle is given by @xmath55 .",
    "the map is then written as : @xmath56 @xmath57 the angles @xmath51 are measured counterclockwisely with respect to each black hole ; the first term in eq .",
    "( [ mapphi ] ) comes from the change in the angle s orientation necessary to take account of that .",
    "consider the initial conditions @xmath58 and @xmath59 . since @xmath60 , we see from the above equations that these values of @xmath9 and @xmath8 are a fixed point of the map .",
    "it corresponds to the periodic orbit depicted in figure 3a , which revolves around the black holes , making a u - turn at each black hole and then heading towards the other .",
    "another periodic orbit is shown in fig .",
    "this orbit is such that @xmath61 and @xmath62 . inserting these conditions in eqs .",
    "( [ mapb ] ) and ( [ mapphi ] ) , we find @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( remember that the angles are defined modulus @xmath65 ) , with @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath67 is given by the solution of the equation @xmath68    these are the simplest periodic orbits , but there are many others .    we observe that equations ( [ mapb ] ) and ( [ mapphi ] ) are valid only as long as @xmath9 remains within the range @xmath69 . if @xmath9 falls out of this interval , the ray either escapes or falls into one of the black holes , and the iteration must be stopped .",
    "we now proceed to study in detail the map defined by equations ( [ mapb ] ) and ( [ mapphi ] ) .",
    "we begin by a direct numerical investigation of these equations .    in order to iterate equations ( [ mapb ] ) and ( [ mapphi ] ) for given initial values @xmath67 and",
    "@xmath70 , we first have to be able to calculate the deflection angle @xmath19 for a given impact parameter @xmath9 . to do this",
    ", we must begin by finding the `` perihelium distance '' @xmath20 corresponding to @xmath9 ; this is done by solving the third - order equation ( [ eqp ] ) for @xmath20 .",
    "we use the well - known newton - raphson method , which guarantees a very fast convergence@xcite .",
    "we then use eqs .",
    "( [ eqq ] ) , ( [ eqk ] ) and ( [ eqchi ] ) to calculate @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and we finally substitute these quantities in eqs .",
    "( [ eqdelta ] ) and ( [ eqf ] ) to obtain @xmath33 .",
    "the elliptical functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 are computed by numerical routines found in @xcite .",
    "depending on its initial conditions , a light ray may either fall into one black hole , fall into the other black hole , or escape towards infinity .",
    "the set of initial conditions which leads to each of these outcomes is called the _ basin _ of that outcome . in our numerical iteration of the map ( [ mapb],[mapphi ] )",
    ", we are interested in obtaining a basin portrait of the system .",
    "to do this , we have to choose a set of initial conditions and iterate them to find out to which basin they belong .",
    "our choice is the one - dimensional set with @xmath59 and an interval of @xmath9 . as we have seen in the previous section , if @xmath71 , the light ray always falls into the event horizon , and if @xmath72 , it always escapes .",
    "we thus choose the interval to be @xmath69 .",
    "we divide this segment into 5000 points , and iterate the map ( [ mapb],[mapphi ] ) for each of these initial conditions , recording the final outcome for each point : if at any point in the iteration @xmath73 , this means that the light ray falls into one of the black holes , and if @xmath74 , it escapes to infinity .",
    "we define the discrete - valued function @xmath75 to be 1 if the orbit with initial conditions @xmath59 , @xmath76 falls into one of the black holes , -1 if it falls into the other , and 0 if it escapes to the asymptotically plane region .",
    "@xmath75 gives a picture of the intersections of the three basins with the segment @xmath59 , @xmath69 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "4a , for @xmath77 .",
    "we see that there are large intervals in which @xmath78 is constant , intercalated by ranges of @xmath9 where @xmath78 varies wildly .",
    "if @xmath70 lies within one of these latter ranges , the final outcome of the light ray is highly uncertain . in fig .",
    "4b we show a magnification of one of these regions . except for the scale ,",
    "it is very similar to fig .",
    "a further magnification is shown in fig .",
    "4c , again revealing structure in small scales .",
    "we have obtained even further magnifications , which are not shown here , and all show similar structures , down to the smallest scales allowed by the numerical limitations .",
    "this shows that @xmath78 has a fractal dependency on @xmath9 .",
    "notice that there are large intervals of @xmath9 where @xmath78 is perfectly regular .",
    "these regular regions are mixed in all scales with the fractal regions , where the outcome of a light ray is highly uncertain .",
    "this sensitivity of the dynamics to the initial conditions is made precise with the definition of the _ box - counting dimension _ , which we now present briefly@xcite .",
    "we define the _ basin boundary _ of the system to be the set of points ( initial conditions ) such that all neighborhoods of these points have points belonging to at least two different basins , no matter how small that neighborhood is . the fractal nature of the basins shown in fig .",
    "4 results from a fractal basin boundary@xcite .",
    "it is not difficult to see that a fractal basin boundary implies a fundamental uncertainty in the final outcome of an orbit .",
    "we now define the box - counting dimension of the basin boundary , which gives a measure of this uncertainty .",
    "let @xmath70 be a randomly chosen impact parameter in the interval @xmath79 $ ] ; we consider @xmath59 throughout for simplification .",
    "let @xmath80 be the probability that there is a point of the basin boundary lying within a distance @xmath81 from @xmath70 . in the limit @xmath82",
    ", @xmath83 generally scales with @xmath81 by a power law .",
    "we thus write : @xmath84 @xmath85 is the box - counting dimension of the intersection of the basin boundary with the one - dimensional section of initial conditions given by @xmath86 $ ] and @xmath59 .",
    "clearly , we must have @xmath87 .",
    "if the basin boundary is regular , then @xmath88 ; fractal boundaries have @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath83 can be interpreted as a measure of the uncertainty as to which basin the point @xmath9 belongs , for a given error @xmath81 in the initial condition , which is always present in a real situation . for a regular basin boundary",
    ", @xmath83 decreases linearly with @xmath81 .",
    "if we have a fractal boundary , however , the power in ( [ scalf ] ) is less than 1 , and @xmath83 decreases much more slowly with @xmath81 , which makes the uncertainty in the outcome much higher than in the case of a regular boundary .",
    "thus , @xmath85 is a good measure of the sensitivity to the initial conditions that results from a fractal basin boundary , and since it is a topological invariant@xcite , it is a meaningful characterization of chaos in general relativity .",
    "we calculate the box - counting dimension @xmath85 numerically by using the method we now explain@xcite .",
    "we pick a large number of initial conditions @xmath9 randomly , and for each one of them we compute the map ( [ mapb]-[mapphi ] ) , finding out its outcome and therefore to which basin it belongs .",
    "we then do the same thing to the two neighboring initial conditions @xmath90 and @xmath91 , for a given ( small ) @xmath81 , for each @xmath9 .",
    "if the three points do not belong to the same basin , @xmath9 is labeled an `` uncertain '' initial condition . for a large number of initial conditions",
    ", we expect that the fraction of uncertain points for a given @xmath81 approximates @xmath80 . calculating in this way @xmath83 for several values of @xmath81",
    ", we use eq .",
    "( [ scalf ] ) to obtain @xmath85 from the inclination of the log - log plot of @xmath83 versus @xmath81 . applied to the two - black - hole map with @xmath77 , this method gives @xmath92 .",
    "the error comes from the statistical uncertainty which results from the finite number of points used in the computation of @xmath83 . in our calculation , the number of initial conditions was such that the number of `` uncertain points '' is always higher than 200 .    how does the fractal basin boundary arise from the dynamics of the map ( [ mapb]-[mapphi ] ) ? in order to answer this question , we first observe that every point in the basin boundary gives rise to orbits that neither escape nor fall into one of the black holes ( otherwise they would be part of one of the basins , which violates the definition of the basin boundary ) ; that is , the basin boundary is made up of `` eternal orbits '' which move forever around the two black holes .",
    "we need thus to investigate these orbits to understand the formation of the basin boundary .",
    "consider the one - dimensional set of initial conditions parameterized by the impact parameter @xmath9 with @xmath59 .",
    "we have seen that if @xmath71 the orbit falls into the event horizon of a black hole , and if @xmath72 the orbit escapes .",
    "thus , the points of the basin boundary belong to the interval latexmath:[\\[\\label{interv }    corresponding to positive and negative values of @xmath9 .",
    "however , not all points in this interval are part of the basin boundary , of course ; in order to survive the next iteration of the map ( [ mapb]-[mapphi ] ) without escaping or falling , the corresponding orbits must be deflected in such a way that they reach the other black hole with an impact parameter within the interval ( [ interv ] ) . from fig .",
    "5 we see that for this to happen the orbits must be deflected by an angle @xmath38 in the neighborhood of @xmath94 , and either @xmath95 or @xmath96 , depending on the previous deflection suffered by the orbit ; the angle @xmath97 depends on the distance separating the black holes .",
    "@xmath42 is the number of turns the orbit makes around one of the black holes before moving on to the other one . for each @xmath42 , there are two intervals of the deflection angle @xmath38 for which the orbit survives the next iteration without escaping or falling ; these two intervals correspond to the positive and negative values of @xmath9 satisfying eq .",
    "( [ interv ] ) .",
    "in the first iteration , the initial interval ( [ interv ] ) is divided into infinitely many pairs of sub - intervals , each pair labeled by the number @xmath42 of times the orbit circles the black hole . from eq .",
    "( [ expon ] ) , intervals corresponding to large @xmath42 s decrease exponentially with @xmath42 . in the next iteration , each of these sub - intervals are themselves divided into an infinite number of intervals , and so on in the next iterations . in the limit of infinite iterations , the set of surviving orbits is a fractal set with zero measure .",
    "this set is the basin boundary , and its fractality is responsible for the complex dynamics shown in fig .",
    "4 . the two fractal regions on the right of fig . 4a consist of orbits whose first scattering has @xmath46 , that is , they are deflected by the black hole by @xmath37 and @xmath98 .",
    "the leftmost fractal region in fig .",
    "4a is actually an infinite number of very small regions , corresponding to orbits with @xmath99 ; the scale of fig .",
    "4a is too large for them to be distinguished .",
    "this gives us an indication that the orbits with @xmath100 are a very small fraction of the basin boundary ; we shall return to this later in this section .",
    "each orbit which is part of the basin boundary can be labeled by an infinite sequence of symbols @xmath101 ( including bi - infinite sequences @xmath102 ) , where each symbol @xmath103 gives the neighborhood of the deflection angle @xmath104 after the @xmath105-th scattering . as an example , the periodic orbit shown in fig .",
    "3a is represented by the sequence @xmath106 . in general",
    ", periodic orbits correspond to repeating sequences .",
    "however , not all sequences are allowed .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "5 that a symbol @xmath107 must be followed either by one of type @xmath108 or @xmath109 , but it can not be followed by a symbol like @xmath110 , that is , of the form @xmath111 with @xmath112 .",
    "analogously , a symbol with @xmath113 of @xmath112 can not be followed by one with @xmath114 . even with these restrictions",
    ", however , there is an uncountable set of non - repeating sequences which label orbits that are part of the basin boundary .",
    "the uncountability of this set is a reflection of the fractal nature of the boundary .",
    "the basin boundary is the stable manifold of the invariant set , which is made by orbits labeled by bi - infinite symbols @xmath102 .",
    "these are orbits that do not escape for both forward and backward iterations of the map ( [ mapb]-[mapphi ] ) .",
    "it is important to observe that the basin boundary is fractal because the scattering function @xmath33 of the isolated black hole ( [ eqdelta ] ) assumes values higher than @xmath37 , which makes it possible for orbits to be scattered to both sides of the black hole , giving rise to the fractal basin boundary . the scattering of particles by two fixed newtonian mass points is immediately seen to be regular , because rutherford s scattering function does not assume values higher than @xmath37",
    "this is of course in accordance with the fact that the fixed two - mass problem in newtonian gravitation is integrable , since the hamilton - jacobi equation of this system is separated in elliptical coordinates @xcite .",
    "we have seen that after being scattered by a black hole , the light ray must have an impact parameter lying on the interval ( [ interv ] ) to belong to the basin boundary . since @xmath115 and @xmath116",
    ", the impact parameter must belong to one of two intervals of length @xmath117 ( the two intervals correspond to positive and negative impact parameters ) . in our approximation , we have @xmath118 . using this fact , we can approximate the value of @xmath9 in fig . 5 by @xmath119 , with an error of @xmath120 at worst , which means a fractional error of about @xmath121 .",
    "the distance @xmath11 in fig . 5 traveled by orbits which were deflected by @xmath94 or @xmath96 in the previous scattering",
    "is thus given by @xmath122 , that is , @xmath123 for the map ( [ mapb]-[mapphi ] ) to be well - defined , we must have @xmath124 .",
    "of course , this condition is satisfied in our approximation @xmath50 . the angle @xmath97 is calculated from fig .",
    "5 in this approximation , using elementary geometry : @xmath125    consider a set of orbits with impact parameters filling the interval @xmath79 $ ] of length @xmath120 , which may have already suffered several previous scatterings .",
    "the subsets of these orbits that survive the next scattering without escaping nor falling in one of the black holes are sub - intervals in the neighborhood of @xmath126 , where @xmath126 are the values of the impact parameter such that the orbit is deflected by an angle of @xmath127 ( @xmath114 , 1 or 2 ) .",

    "( [ eqbnk ] ) , according to the rules of the symbolic dynamics we exposed above .",
    "because the distance @xmath47 is much larger than @xmath120 , the allowed range in the deflection angle @xmath129 around @xmath127 of an orbit such that it arrives at the other black hole with @xmath9 in the interval ( [ interv ] ) is approximately : @xmath130 where @xmath11 is given by eq .",

    "( [ expon ] ) , they decrease exponentially with increasing @xmath42 .",
    "these values show that for most purposes we can disregard the contributions to the dynamics from deflections with @xmath100 : the measure of the set of orbits that make multiple turns around a black hole is negligible .",
    "this approximation will be used extensively in the next section .",
    "equations ( [ eqbnk]-[eqlambda ] ) are not exact , because the derivative @xmath152 varies in the intervals @xmath131 . to estimate the error , we use the fact that the @xmath131 are small .",

    "thus , the fractional errors in the values @xmath150 given by the approximate formula ( [ eqlambda ] ) are very small , of about @xmath161 for @xmath77 . in the limit of large @xmath47 , we have @xmath162 , and @xmath163 : the fractional error is inversely proportional to the separation @xmath47 , and the approximation ( [ eqlambda ] ) gets better and better as @xmath47 increases .",
    "we now take the limit @xmath165 . from eqs .",
    "( [ eqalpha ] ) and ( [ eql ] ) , we have that in this limit @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "( [ eqbnk ] ) and ( [ eqlambda ] ) then imply that @xmath168 and @xmath169 : the two intervals of surviving orbits of a given @xmath42 come closer and closer as @xmath47 increases , and their lengths become the same in this limit .",
    "because of the approximate equality in the lengths , the magnification of each interval by @xmath170 gives approximately the same set of intervals .",
    "in other words , the fractal basin boundary is _ self - similar _ in this approximation .",
    "the box - counting dimension of this self - similar set is given by the solution of the transcendental equation@xcite : @xmath171    as we have seen in the previous section , @xmath172 is many orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath173 .",
    "therefore , it is a good approximation to neglect terms with @xmath100 in the above expression , and @xmath85 can then be explicitly written as : @xmath174 from eq .",
    "( [ eqlambda ] ) , we have @xmath175 , and we get : @xmath176 with @xmath177 . for large @xmath47 , the box - counting dimension decays logarithmically with the distance , which is a very slow decay law . even for the large distances found in astronomy ,",

    "( [ eqd ] ) could have observational consequences .",
    "now we consider the case of two black holes with different masses @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the limit @xmath180 , where @xmath181 and @xmath182 are the impact parameters corresponding to deflections of @xmath37 of the two black holes . because the two masses are different , the ranges @xmath183 and @xmath184 of impact parameters for surviving orbits are different , and therefore the allowed range of scattering angles depends on which black hole the orbit is heading to .",
    "this means that the ` shrinking factors ' @xmath185 and @xmath186 ( given by eq .",
    "( [ eqlambda ] ) ) depend on the black hole .",
    "this spoils the property of self - similarity , which is a feature of the equal - masses case in the limit @xmath187 .",
    "however , since the orbits are scattered alternately by the two black holes , the _ square _ of the scattering map defined by the system is self - similar , in the limit @xmath187 .    after two iterations , of each interval",

    "each of these subsets gives rise to four others after two further iterations , and so on .",

    "( [ eqlambda ] ) and ( [ b00 ] ) with @xmath4 replaced by @xmath178 and @xmath179 , we obtain @xmath185 and @xmath191 , and we find : @xmath192 where @xmath193 , @xmath194 . the difference between eqs .",
