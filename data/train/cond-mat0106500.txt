    "the dynamics of fluidized granular systems has attracted much attention in physics communities as a non - equilibrium statistical system@xcite . due to the fact that an elemental particle in granular systems is already macroscopic",
    ", there are two major differences in their dynamics from that of an ordinary molecular system .",
    "first , thermal fluctuation does not play any role because relevant energy scales for the kinetic and potential energy are much larger than the thermal energy .",
    "second , the dynamics is dissipative because the degrees of freedom we are dealing with are coupled with microscopic processes that are not treated explicitly . because of these properties , granular systems require an energy source in order to be in a steady state and the external gravitational force plays an important role in their dynamics .    in most experimental situations ,",
    "the systems are excited by a vibrating plate .",
    "this is called `` granular vibrated bed '' , in which the effect of gravity is very large@xcite .",
    "granular vibrated bed has been studied in many simulation works@xcite .",
    "the convection@xcite and a linear stability analysis of surface wave@xcite in the vibrated bed have been theoretically studied . in the conventional setting of",
    "vibrated bed , the frequency of external driving plays an important role and this gives variety of patterns phases .",
    "experiments on pattern formation in granular vibrated bed , have demonstrated the existence of subharmonic stripe , square , and hexagonal patterns@xcite , as well as localized structures called oscillons@xcite , when the frequency and amplitude of the vibration are varied .",
    "comparison between kinetic theory and simulation for pattern formation has been done@xcite .",
    "the patterns are similar in spatial structure to those observed in fluid dynamical systems , most notably parallel convection rolls in a thin layer of fluid heated from below ( rayleigh - bnard convection ) and standing surface waves in a vertically vibrated liquid layer ( faraday instability ) .",
    "however , the vibration complicates the situation . since energy input from the vibration depends on both the amplitude @xmath1 and the angular frequency @xmath2 , the accurate quantities of input energy can not be estimated from the external control parameter @xmath3 , which is usually used as the control parameter in",
    "the granular vibrated bed .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to construct the theory for the dissipative particles system in the non - equilibrium steady state . from the numerical point of view , the distinct element method ( dem)@xcite , which is the soft - core particles model , has been often used for the studies of granular vibrated bed .",
    "however , if we want to obtain the data for the statistical properties during the simulation , the sampling data must be taken at the same phase of external vibration cycle .",
    "moreover , in the dynamics of dissipative particles , the effect of different time step is not negligible .",
    "this is a crucial effect to the particle behavior especially when the system is in the high density .",
    "therefore , dem seems to have the practical disadvantages to study the correct statistical properties and dynamical behavior in the dissipative system , and is not appropriate as the simplest model for the study of the non - equilibrium steady state .",
    "the granular vibrated bed has these disadvantages to study the statistical characters of the granular system from the aspects of both theory and simulation .",
    "although there already have been many studies on the granular system for fluidization , most of these studies were a collection of the various phenomena from the experimental and numerical results , and these were discussed individually for each study .",
    "therefore , it becomes difficult to capture what the intrinsic characters of the granular system are .",
    "since the study of granular system requires new theoretical ideas beyond ordinary standard statistical mechanics or hydrodynamics , a simple ideal model system to compare the theoretical studies for the non - equilibrium steady state is required for the progress .",
    "recently , a series of works to find some universal frameworks have been appeared ( see , sec .  [ sec:2-a ] ) . in their study , the granular particles are regarded as a collection of inelastic hard spheres that interact with each other via hard sphere potential .",
    "the assumption of an ideally hard sphere potential is also used in kinetic theory and the boltzmann or enskog approaches , which facilitates comparisons between theory and simulation in the elastic limit . from the numerical point of view , even if the typical distance between the particles is short , the molecular dynamics event - driven simulation , which is used in the hard - spheres system , is quite efficient and has smaller numerical error compared with time - step - driven method ( e.g. , dem ) .    since the gravitational force should have a large effect on clustering",
    ", it would be of interest to observe how the system behavior changes as the gravity sets in .",
    "the main purpose of our study is to examine the statistical and dynamical characters of the inelastic hard disk system in the non - equilibrium steady state under gravity , and to provide extensive numerical results for theoretical studies to construct a base of the universal framework . in this paper",
    ", we particularly focus on the competition between the effect of external driving and that of the gravitational field using the event - driven molecular dynamics simulation , systematically .    in sec .",
    "[ sec:2-a ] , we will present a short review of a series of previous works using the inelastic hard sphere model with the heat bath in the non - equilibrium steady states . our model is described in sec .",

    "to achieve the non - equilibrium steady state ( ness ) in the granular system , energy must be injected into the system from outside .",
    "previous studies for ness in the inelastic hard sphere ( ihs ) system may be categorized by the following six groups .",
    "firstly , we categorize the models by their dimensionality ( 1d or 2d ) .",
    "secondly , we consider the way in which the system is linked to the heat bath ( i.e. , heated from the boundaries / bulk ) .",

    "we will briefly review these models for each category .",
    "du et al .",
    "@xcite firstly studied the dynamics of quasi - elastic particles constrained to move on a line with energy input from boundaries .",
    "they showed that the system violates equi - partition of energy and the simple hydrodynamic approach fails to give a correct description of the system .",
    "similar models in ness were also studied from the theoretical point of view@xcite .",
    "some papers investigated the properties of the ihs fluid that is heated uniformly by random force so that it reaches a spatially homogeneous steady state .",
    "this way of forcing was proposed by williams and mackintosh@xcite for inelastic particles moving on a line .",
    "giese and zippelius@xcite regarded the internal degree of vibrating rods as a thermal bath .",
    "they calculated the restitution coefficient @xmath4 as a function of the relative length of the colliding rods , the center of mass velocity , and the degree of excitation of the internal vibrations .",
    "puglisi et al.@xcite examined a model consisting of @xmath5 particles on a ring of length @xmath6 with the langevin force .",
    "they found two regimes : when the typical relaxation time @xmath7 of the driving brownian process is small compared with the mean collision time @xmath8 the spatial density is nearly homogeneous and the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of velocity is gaussian , but in the opposite limit @xmath9 one has strong spatial clustering , with a fractal distribution of particles , and the velocity pdf strongly deviates from the gaussian .",
    "kurtze and hong@xcite studied the effect of dissipation on the density profile of 1d granular gas under gravity .",
    "perturbation analysis of the boltzmann equation reveals that the correction of the density profile along the height @xmath10 due to dissipation resulting from inelastic collisions is positive for @xmath11 and negative for @xmath12 .",
    "they also obtained the expression for @xmath13 . using boltzmann equation and molecular - dynamics",
    "simulations , ramrez and cordero@xcite studied the 1d column of @xmath5 inelastic point particles , in the quasielastic limit , under gravity .",
    "they showed that the physical properties ( e.g. , density and temperature profile ) in the hydrodynamic limit ( @xmath14 ) depend solely on the product @xmath15 , where @xmath4 is the restitution coefficient , which was confirmed by both theory and simulation .",
    "esipov and pschel@xcite studied the kinetic energy distribution function satisfying the boltzmann equation and construct the phase diagram of granular systems on the 2d particle system in a circle wall at constant temperature .",
    "their study has suggested that the granular hydrodynamics is valid for simple flows or for any flows in dilute and sufficiently elastic systems .",
    "grossman et al.@xcite studied the steady state theoretically .",
    "their predictions compared well with numerical simulations in the nearly elastic limit .",
    "although the system is no longer close to equilibrium even in the low - density limit , the scaling behavior of the velocity distributions showed that a hydrodynamic treatment could still be useful .",
    "the steady state of a low - density ihs gas confined between two parallel walls with same temperature is studied by brey and cubero@xcite .",
    "soto et al.@xcite also has studied the heat conduction between two parallel plates by molecular dynamics simulation of the ihs model .",
    "their results show that fourier s law is not valid and a new term proportional to the density gradient must be added .",
    "peng and ohta@xcite studied the 2d granular system where an external driving force is applied to each particle in the system in such a way that the system is driven into a steady state by balancing the energy input and the dissipation due to inelastic collisions between particles . experimentally",
    ", steady state of clustering , long - range order , and inelastic collapse are observed in vertically shaken granular monolayer , which is correspond to the system heated from the bulk in the limit of the frequency @xmath16  @xcite . in 2d",
    "the model may be considered to describe the dynamics of disks moving on an air table .",
    "a similar ihs model with random external accelerations has been studied by bizon et al.@xcite to test continuum theories for vertically vibrated layers of granular material . to investigate the long - scale correlation and structure factor ,",
    "van noije et al.@xcite present a theory of the randomly driven ihs fluid in 2d simulation , and characterized its non - equilibrium steady state . as another way to realize the steady state",
    ", komatsu@xcite introduced a new observation frame with a rescaled time .",
    "this operation is the same as the velocity scaling method , which is often used as the temperature control method of the molecular dynamics simulation in equilibrium .",
    "he found that a phase transition with symmetry breaking , which is the circulation of the particles in the box with elastic walls , occurs when the magnitude of dissipation is greater than a critical value .      in 2d system under the gravity , luding et",
    "al.@xcite compared the results of dem and ihs model .",
    "the system of their study is driven by vibrations like a granular vibrated bed .",
    "the results of dem simulation were good agreement with that of event - driven simulation in the fluidized regime .",
    "they also found that the results of dem simulation depend strongly on the time @xmath17 during which the particles are in contact .",
    "although there exist only a few recent laboratory experiments for 2d system under the gravity , an experiment on the stainless steel particle system in two dimensions was studied by kudrolli et al.@xcite .",
    "the system was driven by the periodically moving wall and slightly inclined to apply the weak gravity .",
    "this experiment showed that the clustering occurs around the opposite side of driving wall when there is no gravity , but the cluster migrates downward when the system is inclined even by a very small angle .      to study the statistical properties of the granular system under an external field with energy input in ness , we propose a simple model system on the 2d inelastic hard disk system heated from the boundaries under the gravity@xcite .",
    "the system considered here consists of inelastic hard disks of mass @xmath18 and diameter @xmath19 in 2d space under uniform gravity .",
    "we employ the periodic boundary condition in the horizontal direction .",
    "the particles collide with each other with a restitution coefficient @xmath4 .",
    "all disks are identical , namely the system is monodispersed . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the rotational degree of freedom . because of the hard - core interaction",
    ", collision is instantaneous and only binary collisions occur .",
    "when two disks , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with respective velocities @xmath22 and @xmath23 collide , the velocities after the collision , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , are given by    @xmath26{\\bf",

    "the particles undergo free fall motion with the gravitational acceleration @xmath28 following parabolic trajectories .",
    "the system is driven by a heat bath with temperature @xmath29 at the bottom of the system ; a disk hitting the bottom bounces back with velocity @xmath30 chosen randomly from the probability distributions @xmath31 and @xmath32@xcite ;    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "note that the wall temperature @xmath29 here is just a parameter to characterize the external driving and is not related to the thermal fluctuation .",
    "we call this system `` inelastic hard disk system with a heat bath under weak gravity '' ( ihshg)@xcite to emphasize the importance of the competition between excitation by the heat bath and the gravity .",
    "the ihshg model is so simple that the system is completely characterized with only four dimensionless parameters : the restitution coefficient @xmath4 , the driving intensity @xmath35 , the system width in the unit of disk diameter @xmath36 , and the particle number of the initial layer thickness @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the system width and @xmath5 is the total number of disks .",
    "now we compare our ihshg model with other typical dissipative system in ness .",
    "rayleigh - bnard(rb ) convection is the typical continuous fluid system , where the energy source is the heat bath at the bottom , the dynamics is described by navier - stokes equation , and the system is driven by the difference of temperature between the top and the bottom .",
    "the dissipation comes from the viscosity of fluid . in this system ,",
    "the control parameters are well known as rayleigh number and prandtl number .",
    "there are some previous md studies of rb convection using elastic hard disk@xcite .",
    "the ordinary granular vibrated beds by using dem@xcite are the discrete soft particles systems ; the energy source is the vibration of the bottom , and the dynamics obeys newton s equation of motion under the gravitational field .",
    "the dissipation appears between inelastic particles , and the control parameter is @xmath39 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the amplitude and the angular frequency respectively .",
    "recently , aoki and akiyama@xcite proposed that the state of granular convection involving multipairs of convection rolls is governed by a dimensionless parameter @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the self - diffusion constant and the energy diffusivity @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "our ihshg model is the discrete hard disks system , the energy source is the heat bath at the bottom and the dynamics obeys newton s equation of motion under the gravitational field .",
    "the dissipation comes from inelastic collision of particles , and the control parameter is @xmath43 .",
    "the present system is analogous to the ordinary granular vibrated bed but simpler because it does not have an external time scale . since ihshg model has no external periodic cycles and there are only four dimensionless parameters in the system , ihshg model is easy to deal with numerical analysis and theoretical approach .",
    "as mentioned briefly in sec .",
    "[ sec:2-a-6 ] , there is a recent experiment@xcite on the stainless steel particle system in 2d similar to ihshg model .",
    "based on these experimental results , we firstly reproduced the clustering phenomenon and the behaviors of ness to simulate ihshg model . consequently , we found that ihshg model could reproduce kudorolli s experiment qualitatively .",
    "note that ihshg model might be categorized in 2d model heated from the boundaries under gravity described in sec .",
    "[ sec:2-a-6 ] .",
    "although it is simple and easy to deal with , there are some problems in ihshg model .",
    "since ihshg model is based on the inelastic hard - sphere model , all problems come from a reason that the potential between two colliding particles is unusually stiff .",
    "the instantaneous collisions imply that an interaction is zero when the particles are not in contact and suddenly becomes infinite when the distance between the colliding particles is zero .",
    "therefore , the momentum exchange occurs instantaneously .",
    "however , in a real system , the situation is different , each contact takes a finite length of time and the force is large but finite .",
    "the infinitely stiff hard - sphere interaction is an idealization or simplification of smooth repulsive pair - potential .    when the restitution coefficient is low ( i.e. , a dissipation rate is high ) or kinetic energy is relatively smaller than potential energy under external gravity force",
    ", the number of collisions during a finite time often diverges .",
    "this is called `` inelastic collapse '' .",
    "it was firstly discovered while studying the 1d model system of dissipative particles with a elastic wall@xcite , thereafter in 2d@xcite .",
    "although the inelastic collapse is thought as artificial pathology , several proposals exist to avoid it@xcite .",
    "the velocity dependence of the restitution coefficient was experimentally measured for binary collisions , and the quantitative study of the internal modes of a granular particle is under way@xcite .",
    "however , the inelastic collapse has never appeared when the dissipation is low and the system is highly excited .",
    "therefore , ihshg model for the parameter region studied here does not need to take care of it .    since the dynamics proceeds by only the event of binary collision , multiparticle interactions are impossible to realize .",
    "in a real system , each contact takes a finite time so that multiparticle contacts are possible .",
    "nevertheless , in the fluidization study , multiparticle collision can be thought as a rare event .",
    "hence , we can ignore this effect .",
    "another problem with the inelastic hard - sphere model is that the static limit does not exist .",
    "for example , in the framework of the inelastic hard - sphere model , a particle can not rest motionless on the ground . in the realistic granular systems",
    ", the potential and elastic energies will approach constant values while the kinetic energy tends to zero .",
    "if the particles would be dissipative hard particles , the inelastic collapse will occur before the kinetic energy vanishes .",
    "the contact forces and stresses are not properly defined so that the system will never reach a static configuration .",
    "however , since ihshg model has a heat bath at the bottom of the system , the kinetic energy always stays finite . in the simulation of ness ,",
    "the dynamics has little effect from this problem .",
    "in this section , we present the results of numerical simulation on ihshg model using the simple and efficient event - driven algorithm@xcite , which allowed us to study the statistical and dynamical properties for a wide range of parameters .",
    "most of the simulations were performed on the system with @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 ( i.e. , @xmath47 ) .",
    "the driving intensity @xmath48 was varied from 25.0 to 909.1 to study the change of the system behavior . in the actual simulation",
    ", we reduced any variables to dimensionless ones by the following three basic units ( @xmath49 ) , which are all fixed at unity .",
    "note that unit time @xmath50 is also unity in these simulations . to ensure that the system had reached a steady state , we relaxed the system until the total energy did not drift",
    ". therefore , the system reaches the non - equilibrium steady state .",
    "thereafter , we started the simulations with the length of 100,000 collisions per particle ; we could obtain the data with small statistical error .",
    "in addition , we performed the simulations with @xmath51 ( i.e. , @xmath52 ) and @xmath53 ( i.e. , @xmath54 ) to study the size - dependence of the system behavior .",
    "these run lengths were 30,000 and 10,000 collisions per particle , respectively .",
    "the discussion for the size - dependence of the system is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 - 0 ] .",
    "in order to characterize the steady states of the system , firstly , we measure the maximum packing fraction @xmath55 at the height @xmath56 as a function of the driving intensity @xmath57 . in the system with @xmath58 , there are two cusps around @xmath59 and @xmath60(@xmath61 in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , suggesting phase transitions with changing @xmath57 .",
    "these transitions should be related to the excitation structure of the state , therefore , we define the excitation ratio @xmath62 by @xmath63 , namely , the ratio of the total kinetic energy @xmath64 to the potential energy @xmath65 .",
    "the cusps appear at the same points for @xmath62 , which confirms that some transitions occur at these points ( @xmath66 in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .      in order to conceptualize the underlying physical mechanism of the system behavior in each phase separated by the transitions ,",
    "three snapshots for typical values of @xmath57 for each phase are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , in which interval time between them are all @xmath67 .    for @xmath68 ( a1a3 in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) , most of the particles are aggregated around the bottom of the system with an almost close packed density , and the state of a dense layer is relatively stable , which means the potential energy is dominant and the system is in weakly excited states .",
    "we call the phase in @xmath69 , the condensed phase ( cp )",
    ". it can be seen from the snapshots , however , that collective motion appears on the surface of the layer .    in the second phase , @xmath70 ( b1b3 in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) , the dense layer packing is locally broken by excitation of the heat bath .",
    "the high - speed particles are blown upward from the holes in the layer . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we see only one hole in the system , but for a larger system , there are certain cases where we can observe more than one hole .",
    "the holes migrate and occasionally become more active ; sometimes they almost close temporarily , but the structure is fairly stable .",
    "we call this phase the locally fluidized phase ( lfp ) .    for the case of @xmath71 in the third phase ( c1c3 in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) , the layer is completely destroyed .",
    "the average density is quite low , but it is very different from the ordinary molecular gas phase . the density fluctuation is large and this fluctuation causes turbulent motion driven by the gravity . at some time , the whole system gets excited with some relatively smaller density fluctuations , but the very next moment , a large proportion of the particles travels downward and forms a layer like structure .",
    "this structure , however , is destroyed immediately .",
    "we call this phase the granular turbulent phase ( gtp ) .",
    "since the simulation was performed in the non - equilibrium steady state , the collision rate takes constant value during the whole run .",
    "therefore , when the total number of collision @xmath72 was fixed , the total time @xmath73 for each run were different for each @xmath57 .",
    "we found that the system in the non - equilibrium steady state can be also characterized by the collision rate because it seems to correspond to the pressure of molecular system in the equilibrium .",
    "though in the elastic hard disk system the collision rate is only the function of packing fraction of the system , in the inelastic hard disk system it depend on the competition between the inelasticity @xmath4 and the external driving @xmath57 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , the collision rate ( @xmath74 ) vs. the external driving @xmath57 in the log - linear scale is shown .",
    "we found that the collision rate decrease exponentially in lfp and gtp ( @xmath75 ) with different exponents .",
    "however , the collision rate deviates from exponential fitting in cp .",
    "it diverges when the system is in the weakly excited state ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "these inhomogeneous behaviors should result in a non - maxwell - boltzmann distribution of velocity .",
    "figure  [ fig:4 ] shows the horizontal velocity probability distribution functions ( pdf ) at the horizontal layer around the height of the maximum packing fraction ( @xmath56 ) for each phase in the log - linear scale .",
    "the data are plotted in the unit of @xmath77 .",
    "the distributions for @xmath70 and @xmath78 deviate from the gaussian and are more or less in exponential form in the tail region .",
    "it can be seen that the distribution for @xmath70 in lfp consists of two parts ; the central part that originates from the dense layer packing , and the wide tail that comes from the fluidized holes .",
    "the central parts for all cases are very close to gaussian ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) .      in order to quantify the deviation from gaussian distribution",
    ", we next calculated the flatness parameter @xmath79 as a function of the height @xmath10 defined by @xmath80    which is often used in the study of the intermittency of the fluid turbulence . the dependence of the external driving of the maximum flatness @xmath81 at the horizontal layers with the thickness of disk diameter @xmath19 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] . over the whole region of external driving @xmath57 ,",

    "this plateau behavior may be also interpreted as the feedback effect of the periodic boundary condition which enforces the number of holes to be one for a certain parameter region of @xmath57 . in the larger systems with @xmath51 and @xmath197",

    "the system exhibits three distinct phases , namely , the condensed phase , the locally fluidized phase , and the granular turbulent phase . in the condensed phase ,",
    "most of the particles are aggregated around the bottom of the system with an almost close packed density and the state is fairly stable ; this is because the excitation of the heat bath is weak and the potential energy ( gravity ) is dominant .",
