    "baryon chiral perturbation theory can be used to systematically compute the properties of baryons as a function of the light quark masses @xmath3 .",
    "a physical quantity s non - analytic dependence on @xmath3 is calculable from pion - loop graphs ; its analytic dependence has contributions both from pion - loop graphs and from low - energy constants that are present in the chiral lagrangian .",
    "it is convenient to formulate baryon chiral perturbation theory in terms of velocity - dependent baryon fields , so that the expansion of the baryon chiral lagrangian in powers of @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the baryon mass ) is manifest  @xcite .",
    "this formulation is called heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the earliest application of heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory was to baryon axial vector currents  @xcite .",
    "two important results were obtained from this analysis .",
    "first , the baryon axial coupling ratios were found to be close to their @xmath2 values with an @xmath6 ratio close to @xmath7 , the value predicted by the non - relativistic quark model .",
    "second , there were large cancellations in the one - loop corrections to the baryon axial vector currents between loop graphs with intermediate spin-@xmath8 octet and spin-@xmath9 decuplet baryon states .",
    "it was later proven using the @xmath0 expansion that the baryon axial couplings ratios should have @xmath2 values with @xmath10 , up to corrections of order @xmath11 for pions  @xcite .",
    "is equal to @xmath7 in the quark representation , and to @xmath12 in the skyrme representation .",
    "the quark and skyrme representations are equivalent in large @xmath1  @xcite up to corrections of relative order @xmath11 for pions  @xcite .",
    "we will use the quark representation in this paper . ] in addition , it was shown that axial vector current loop graphs with octet and decuplet intermediate states cancel to various orders in @xmath1 . for nucleon and delta intermediate states ,",
    "there is a cancellation of the one - loop graphs to two orders in @xmath1 ; each individual one - loop diagram is of order @xmath1 , but the sum of all one - loop diagrams is of order @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "similar large-@xmath1 cancellations also occur for other baryonic quantities  @xcite .",
    "we would like to find a calculational scheme that simultaneously exhibits both the @xmath3 and @xmath0 expansions . in the chiral limit @xmath13 ,",
    "pions become massless goldstone boson states .",
    "there is an expansion about the chiral limit in powers of @xmath14 , or equivalently , in powers of @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the scale of chiral symmetry breaking and @xmath17 is the pion mass .",
    "chiral symmetry , there are loop corrections involving the pions , kaons and @xmath18 which depend on the pion , kaon and @xmath18 masses , respectively .",
    "chiral perturbation theory depends on the expansion parameters @xmath15 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "large-@xmath1 chiral perturbation theory also depends on the @xmath21 mass . ] in the large-@xmath1 limit , the nucleon and delta become degenerate , @xmath22 , and form a single irreducible representation of the contracted spin - flavor symmetry of baryons in large-@xmath1 qcd  @xcite .",
    "there is an expansion in powers of @xmath0 about the large-@xmath1 limit .",
    "we will consider a combined expansion in @xmath14 and @xmath0 about the double limit @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "loop graphs in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory have a calculable dependence on the ratio @xmath25 . in general",
    ", this dependence is described by a function @xmath26 . in the chiral limit @xmath13 with @xmath27",
    "held fixed , the function can be expanded in powers of @xmath25 , @xmath28 whereas in the @xmath29 limit with @xmath17 held fixed , the function can be expanded in powers of @xmath30 , @xmath31 the difference between the two expansions in eqs .  ( [ eq1 ] ) and  ( [ eq2 ] )",
    "is commonly referred to as the non - commutativity of the chiral and large-@xmath1 limits  @xcite .",
    "it is important to remember , however , that the conditions for heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( including delta states ) to be valid are that @xmath32 * and * @xmath33 . the ratio @xmath25 is not constrained and can take any value .",
    "the entire dependence of a physical quantity on @xmath25 is * calculable * in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory  @xcite , so the ratio @xmath25 need not be small or large for calculations . in the real world , @xmath34 , so it is useful to have a calculational scheme that retains the full functional dependence of @xmath26 on the ratio @xmath25 .",
    "a straightforward approach is to simply calculate the full dependence on @xmath25 of the loop graphs , and evaluate the loop correction at the physical value @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "another common procedure advocated in the literature is to not include intermediate delta particles explicitly in loops , but to incorporate their effects into the low - energy constants of the effective lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of this second approach is that one finds large numerical cancellations between loop diagrams with intermediate nucleon states and low - energy constants containing the effects of delta states .",
    "these cancellations are guaranteed to occur as a consequence of the contracted spin - flavor symmetry which is present in the @xmath35 limit .",
    "the large-@xmath1 spin - flavor symmetry responsible for the cancellations is hidden in this approach because including only the spin-@xmath8 baryons in the chiral lagrangian breaks the large-@xmath1 spin - flavor symmetry explicitly , since the spin-@xmath8 and spin-@xmath9 baryons together form an irreducible representation of spin - flavor symmetry . because the sum of the loop contributions with intermediate octet and decuplet states respects spin - flavor symmetry and is much smaller ( by powers of @xmath0 ) than each individual loop contribution separately",
    ", it is important to keep the large-@xmath1 spin - flavor symmetry of the baryon chiral lagrangian and the large-@xmath1 cancellations manifest .    in this paper",
    ", we will show how one can combine heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory with the @xmath0 expansion so that the full - dependence on @xmath25 is retained and the @xmath0 cancellations are explicit .",
    "this method has the advantage that the loop correction to the baryon axial isovector current , which is order @xmath0 , is automatically obtained to be of this order , instead of as the sum of two contributions ( loop correction and counterterm ) of order @xmath1 which cancel to two powers in @xmath0 .",
    "note that at higher orders the cancellations become more severe , and it is even more important to keep the @xmath0 cancellations manifest .",
    "for example , at two loops , each loop diagram is naively of order @xmath36 , whereas the sum of all two - loop diagrams is order @xmath11 .",
    "not including the @xmath0 cancellations in a systematic way gives a misleading picture of the baryon chiral expansion ",
    "one finds higher order corrections that grow with @xmath1 , which is incorrect .",
    "including the @xmath0 cancellations restores the @xmath0 power counting so that the loop corrections are suppressed by the factor @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the number of loops .",

    "all these terms contribute * at the same order * to the double - commutator , whereas according to the usual counting one would have expected the @xmath187 product @xmath203 to be one power of @xmath1 more important that the @xmath208 product @xmath209 , which in turn would be more important by one power of @xmath1 than the @xmath190 products .",
    "this result has an important consequence : the one - loop correction is very sensitive to the deviations of the axial coupling ratios from their @xmath2 values . while the deviations are small corrections to the couplings themselves , their importance gets enhanced in the one - loop coefficient , because the leading term ( proportional to @xmath210 ) is @xmath11 suppressed .",

    "these terms are analytic in the quark mass @xmath3 .",
    "the analytic contributions from the chiral lagrangian can be of order @xmath1 , i.e. the same order in @xmath1 as the tree - level contribution .",
    "we have shown how to rewrite loop corrections in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory so as to include the full dependence on the delta - nucleon mass difference , while at the same time including the cancellations that follow from the large-@xmath1 spin - flavor symmetry of baryons .",
    "the treatment in this paper has included the decuplet - octet mass difference , but neglected the @xmath133 splittings of the octet and decuplet baryons .",
    "it is possible to generalize our analysis by including the @xmath133 mass splittings in the baryon mass operator @xmath172 .",
    "the one - loop correction to the baryon axial vector currents is very sensitive to deviations of the axial couplings from their @xmath2 symmetry ratios , since the correction that depends only on the @xmath2 coupling ratios ( the @xmath203 term ) is suppressed by @xmath11 , and the first subleading correction ( the @xmath209 term ) is suppressed by @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the normally second subleading terms with two powers of @xmath155 in the axial currents are as important as these two contributions .",
