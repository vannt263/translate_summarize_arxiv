    "there is a growing number of experiments which suggest that the existence of inhomogeneous electronic structures is a generic feature of the hole - doped high - temperature superconductors .",
    "often these structures take the shape of quasi - one - dimensional hole - rich stripes running along various directions in the copper - oxygen planes @xcite .",
    "the relevance of inhomogeneities in general and stripes in particular to the phenomenon of high - temperature superconductivity is presently far from being a settled issue .",
    "neutron - scattering experiments have produced clear evidence for a significant correlation between signatures of incommensurate spin excitations in and the superconducting properties of this compound .",
    "recently , it has been demonstrated @xcite that such low - energy incommensurate spin excitations exist in the superconducting phase of all the way up to its overdoped boundary at @xmath5 , where they disappear simultaneously with superconductivity . on the underdoped side of the phase diagram",
    "static magnetic stripe signatures exist both in the insulating spin - glass phase @xcite with @xmath6 and in the underdoped superconductor @xcite with @xmath7 .",
    "however , the transition from the insulator to the superconductor at @xmath8 is accompanied by a rotation of the stripe signal from the diagonal direction in the former to a bond - aligned signal in the latter .",
    "moreover , angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) has revealed @xcite an apparent coincidence between the collapse of the gap along the nodal ( diagonal ) directions in @xmath9-space and the appearance of diagonal stripes in samples near the n@xmath10el boundary of the antiferromagnet at @xmath11 .",
    "motivated by these observations we are interested in finding a possible correspondence between the geometry of stripes and their low - energy properties . however , studying the physics of stripes as self - organized systems in the strongly interacting copper - oxygen planes is a difficult task for which reliable analytical tools are still missing .",
    "instead , we propose to investigate rudimentary models of stripes in the form of hubbard ladders defined as bond - aligned and diagonal sections of a square lattice with nearest - neighbor @xmath12 and next - nearest - neighbor @xmath13 hopping . in doing",
    "so we avoid the question of the mechanism which leads to the segregation of holes into stripes ( on which there are different views @xcite ) , and assume that it takes place at energies higher than the energy scales which govern the physics of holes on the ladders . on the other hand , we will concentrate on a single ladder thus restricting the discussion to energies larger than any inter - stripe coupling ( such as inter - stripe tunneling ) , which is assumed small . while the degree to which holes are restricted to move along stripes in the real systems is not well understood it is clear that the limit of total confinement , assumed in the ladder models , is an idealization . to probe the sensitivity of the results to this point we consider , for each of the two geometries mentioned above , both 2 and 3-leg ladders .",
    "arguably , the most severe shortcoming of the present study , with respect to its applicability to the physics of stripes in the cuprates , is the fact that the interaction between electrons on the ladders is assumed weak and treated using a perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) technique .",
    "nevertheless , previous numerical studies@xcite have shown that many of the qualitative features uncovered by perturbative analysis of hubbard ladders survive the limit of strong coupling where the emergent energy scales are of the order of the exchange interaction @xmath14 .",
    "this fact suggests that the gross features which we discover in the phase diagrams of the models considered here may likewise extend into the strong coupling regime .",
    "of course , this needs to be verified by explicit calculations .",
    "our principal results are presented in figs .",
    "[ bond2llfig ] - [ diag3llfig ] .",
    "they contain the phase diagrams of the ladders as a function of the relative strength of next - nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath15 and the average electronic occupation per site @xmath16 .",
    "the various phases are labeled according to the number of charge and spin modes @xcite that remain gapless in the presence of interactions .",
    "we find a distinct difference between the behavior of bond - aligned and diagonal ladders for small values of @xmath15 and doping levels in the range of @xmath17 . in this region",
    "the bond - aligned ladders are maximally - gapped with only one remaining gapless charge mode associated with global gauge and translational invariance @xcite ( at commensurate fillings this mode may be gapped as well ) .",
    "this finding extends previous results for such models obtained both from weak - coupling treatments @xcite and numerical calculations at strong - coupling @xcite .",
    "conversely , the diagonal ladders remain gapless under similar conditions .",
    "such behavior has been known for the 2-leg `` zig - zag '' ladder @xcite and our results demonstrate that it persists also in the case of the diagonal 3-leg `` diamond '' ladder .",
    "increasing the value of @xmath15 in bond - aligned systems , which exhibit a gapped phase for zero @xmath13 , leads to a decrease of the gap . in the diagonal ladders similar variation of the next - nearest - neighbor hopping results in a transition from a gapless to a gapped phase above a certain critical value .",
    "further increase of @xmath15 enhances the gap , which reaches a maximum and then decreases .    in order to gain some insight into the effects of a magnetically ordered background on the physics of ladders we replace the non - interacting spectrum of the ladder by the bound - states spectrum of a linear defect in an antiferromagnetic two - dimensional lattice . in this way",
    "we include on a crude mean - field level the interactions between the stripe electrons and the surrounding spins . the interactions between electrons on the defect are still treated perturbatively .",
    "we find that the changes in the spectrum typically have little effect on the overall structure of the phase diagrams , as long as the electronic states are reasonably localized on the defects .",
    "when changes do occur they often tend to reduce the extent of the gapped phases .    notwithstanding the above mentioned limitations of our study ,",
    "we note that our findings , and the experimental congruity between stripes orientation and superconductivity , conform with the notion that the origin of the superconducting gap is to be found in the gap which develops on the quasi - one - dimensional stripes @xcite .",
    "the results may also provide an explanation , within the stripes picture , for the dichotomy between gapped and gapless behavior in @xmath9-space , as revealed by arpes .",
    "we elaborate on these points and raise few difficulties related to such interpretations in the discussion section .",
    "consider the hubbard model on a square lattice with nearest - neighbor @xmath12 and next - nearest - neighbor @xmath13 hopping .",

    "we will concentrate on the minimal models for bond - centered and site - centered stripes as 2-leg and 3-leg ladders , respectively .",

    "we study the above models in the weak - coupling limit using rg techniques .",
    "much of the analysis is identical to the one used in previous studies of hubbard ladders @xcite and consequently we outline here only the basic steps of the procedure , relegating some of the remaining details to the appendix .",

    "more information on the character of the massive fields , and the relevant operators which give them their masses , is detailed in the appendix .",
    "we find that whenever the c1s0 phase is not reached the systems retain all of their non - interacting gapless modes , as indicated in the clear parts of the diagrams .        for the 2-leg ladders we have also considered the possibility of umklapp scattering and momentum - conserving `` special '' processes which exist for particular values of the fermi wave - vectors .",

    "this happens along the thick solid lines in the diagrams . across each of these lines",
    "the number of fermi point pairs changes by 1 ( or 2 in the case of a `` w '' shaped band ) .",
    "for the bond - aligned ladders a flat band arises along the dotted lines in their diagrams while for the 3-leg diagonal ladder such a band occurs for @xmath45 and @xmath49 .",
    "our results are unreliable in the vicinity of these lines .",
    "our most important finding is a correlation between the ladder orientation and the nature of its phase at small values of @xmath15 .",

    "our results also agree with the gapless behavior found in a previous dmrg study of the diagonal 2-leg ladder@xcite and add information about this system at commensurate fillings .",
    "we are unaware of past treatments of the 3-leg diagonal ladder , especially in the strong interaction regime .",
    "it is therefore unclear whether the gapless phase found by us in this model survives beyond the limit of weak - coupling .",
    "it is , however , interesting to note that at half filling and for @xmath45 and @xmath51 , the diagonal 3-leg ladder is equivalent to an alternating spin-1 and spin-1/2 chain , which is known to be gapless@xcite .",

    "typically we find that the gap changes smoothly across boundaries between adjacent extended c1s0 phases , regardless of the rg stage at which they become fully gapped .",
    "one exception is the 3-leg bond - aligned ladder at small @xmath15 where the gap increases considerably in the region around @xmath46 due to a much smaller @xmath36 ( which , in passing , we note scales as @xmath52 ) .",

    "further increase of the hopping amplitude causes the gap to grow , reach a maximum and then decrease .",
    "we observe a similar behavior also in the 3-leg ladders .",
    "since the cuprate high - temperature superconductors are born out of parent antiferromagnets one expects to find slow fluctuations of a collective field representing the local staggered magnetization .",

    "consequently , we consider a reduced model whose non - interacting spectrum is composed of these localized mid - gap bands only .",
    "this band structure expresses , albeit on a coarse mean - field level , the effects of interactions between the electrons on the defect and the electrons comprising the antiferromagnetic background . in the cuprates these interactions",
    "are expected to be of similar magnitude to the interactions between the electrons moving along the stripes . however ,",
    "in our perturbative treatment the latter are assumed much weaker . while unjustified when modeling real stripes this assumption enables us to treat the interactions on the defect in a controlled manner and gain some insight into the effects of the coupling between stripes and their antiferromagnetic environment .    to make contact with the ladder models of the previous section we relate the electronic operators on the defect sites to the creation operators of the localized states .",
    "the result is analogous to eq .",
    "( [ transformation ] ) with two differences .",
    "first , the exact expansion of the site operators generally includes components along extended states .",
    "such components are projected out and the remaining sum is properly normalized .",
    "as long as the mid - gap states are well localized on the defect the projected expansion remains a faithful representation of the site operators on the stripe .",
    "secondly , for an @xmath18-leg bond - aligned defect the staggered field induces a doubling of the unit - cell and of the number of localized bands .",
    "accordingly , in eq .",
    "( [ transformation ] ) , @xmath22 becomes the unit - cell coordinate and @xmath23 stands for the leg number together with the site index within the unit - cell .",
    "the sum over the band index then runs from 1 to @xmath63 and the sum over the momentum along the defect extends from @xmath64 to @xmath65 .",
    "this effect is absent in the case of diagonal stripes . on the other hand , and in contrast to the bond - aligned systems , the spin degeneracy of the bands is lifted whenever the spin texture is symmetric on opposite sides of a diagonal defect [ this happens in anti-(in- ) phase defects with even(odd ) @xmath18 ] .    from this point",
    "onward the analysis of the interactions between electrons on the defect , as given by the hubbard term eq .",
    "( [ hubbardterm ] ) , follows the same course described for the ladder models .",

    "we already referred to the fact that identifying the mid - gap sector of the spectrum with the electronic states of a stripe makes sense as long as these states are well localized on the defect .",

    "it is unclear to what extent they represent the properties of ladders at strong coupling .",

    "the opening of this gap leads to intra - stripe power - law superconducting correlations , which turn eventually , via inter - stripe josephson pair - tunneling , into global long - range superconducting order .",
    "for stripes to play an essential role in the physics of the cuprates they must exist , either as static order or as fluctuating correlations , above the pseudogap crossover and the superconducting transition temperatures .",

    "our finding that under generic conditions weakly interacting diagonal ladders are gapless while bond - aligned ladders possess a spin - gap , offers some support to the hypothesis that a similar difference between the low - energy properties of bond - aligned and diagonal stripes is behind the coincidence of the insulator - superconductor transition and the rotation of the stripes direction in this compound@xcite .",
    "it also supports the identification of bond - aligned stripes as the origin of the gapped arpes spectrum around @xmath71 ( and symmetry related points ) in @xmath9-space , and the association of the gapless fermi surface at @xmath72 with diagonal stripes .",

    "this signal coexists with incommensurate diagonal peaks for @xmath74 and grows stronger with @xmath22 .",
    "there is , however , some evidence coming from arpes@xcite that a similar but faint gapped band exists also in @xmath75 samples for which no corresponding neutron - scattering signal has been reported .    a more serious objection ,",
