    "many unusual features of the high temperature superconductors ( htsc ) are understood in terms of a momentum dependent order parameter @xmath1 .",
    "it follows from the success of these developments naturally , that investigating the properties of unconventional condensates in the density wave sector may as well turn out to be a fruitful enterprise . indeed , in the last few years researchers encountered mysterious low temperature phases in a number of materials , where a clear and robust thermodynamic phase transition is not accompanied by an order parameter detectable by conventional means",
    "this situation is often referred to as hidden order .",
    "prime example is the 17.5  k transition in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 with very small magnetic moment in the low temperature phase .",
    "it has been suggested@xcite , that an unconventional spin density wave ( usdw ) may be responsible for this behavior , since in the clean system usdw does not exhibit periodic spin density modulation due to the vanishing momentum average of the order parameter .",
    "the origin of the small but finite magnetic moment , termed micromagnetism , however remains elusive .",
    "the magnetic phase diagram of some @xmath2-(et)@xmath0 salts also offers a low temperature phase ( ltp ) with resemblance to charge density waves ( cdw)@xcite , but without the characteristic x - ray satellites .",
    "in this situation a quasi - one dimensional ucdw scenario@xcite is called for , and it s case is strengthened by the evaluation of the corresponding threshold electric field for sliding conductivity@xcite .",
    "finally , the pseudogap phase of high temperature superconductors was proposed to be a kind of ucdw as well@xcite .",
    "however , micromagnetism was also observed in ybco by neutron scattering@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a mechanism by which the usdw exhibits weak priodic spin density modulation in the presence of random magnetic impurities . comparing the temperature dependence of neutron scattering intensity due to this modulation with experimental data on uru@xmath0si@xmath0@xcite , we argue that this mechanism is responsible for the micromagnetism in this material , and possibly also in the pseudogap phase of htsc .",
    "the unconventional spin density wave ( usdw ) with spin polarization in the @xmath2 direction ( @xmath3 ) is described in the nambu formalism by the green s function @xmath4 , where the @xmath5 and @xmath6 pauli matrices operate on the electron - hole , and spin space respectively , @xmath7 is the electron spectrum measured from the fermi energy , and @xmath1 is the momentum dependent order parameter . in the quasi - one dimensional case@xcite it can be for example @xmath8 ,",
    "while for uru@xmath0si@xmath0 @xmath9 $ ] has been proposed@xcite . clearly , due to the vanishing momentum average of @xmath1 , the expectation value of any component of the spin density is zero@xcite .",
    "it turns out , that the quantity which does have a periodic modulation with the nesting vector @xmath10 , is the spin current density@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the ideal system there is no spin density modulation , therefore the micromagnetism remains unexplained , although the green s function definitely prefers a unique direction ( @xmath2 ) in spin space .",
    "there is no such spin direction for ucdw , therefore the mechanism for micromagnetism proposed below will not work in that case .",
    "we assume that we have magnetic impurities in our sample at positions @xmath11 with spin @xmath12 interacting with the electron spin density through a heisenberg exchange coupling @xmath13 .",
    "the first diagram on fig .",
    "[ fig : graph ] shows the change in the thermodynamic potential due to impurities : @xmath14,\\label{tdpot}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the matrix element of the impurity potential between bloch states ( @xmath16 spanning the electron hole space ) .",
    "@xmath17 vanishes for any kind of cdw , but for usdw each impurity feels a potential energy @xmath18 , trying to align the inpurity spin parallel to the spin direction favoured by the usdw , including its periodicity given by @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath19 is the component of the interaction driving the usdw transition , while @xmath20 is the coefficient of the term originating from @xmath21 ( a matrix element of the exchange integral @xmath22 between bloch states ) , having the same momentum dependence as the order paprameter does ( for example @xmath23 ) .",
    "uru    once the impurity spins are coherently aligned much like in a conventional sdw , the electron spin polarization around them will also develop coherently , facilitating the observation of a magnetic order by neutron scattering .",
    "the electron spin density induced by impurities can be calculated from the second diagram on fig .  [",
    "fig : graph ] as @xmath24 , \\label{spin}\\ ] ] where @xmath25_{s^\\prime , s}= \\varphi^*_{{\\bf k}^\\prime+s^\\prime{\\bf q}/2}({\\bf r}){\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\sigma$ } } \\varphi_{{\\bf k}+s{\\bf q}/2}({\\bf r})$ ] .",
    "a similar expression has already been evaluated@xcite for the impurity pinning potential in udw , which allows us to express the electron spin density at the impurity site @xmath11 .",
    "the excess spin polarization due to the usdw turns out to be parallel to the usdw s preferred spin direction ( @xmath2 ) as well , and the temperature dependence of its magnitude normalized to the @xmath26 value is given by @xmath27 the neutron scattering intensity is proportional to the square of this amplitude , and its normalized temperature dependence is plotted on fig .  [",
    "fig : urusi ] , along with the experimental data@xcite on uru@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "[ t][b][1][0]@xmath28 [ b][t][1][0]@xmath29",
    "we have proposed a mechanism for the development of micromagnetism in usdw , and shown that the temperature dependence of the magnetic moment is consistent with measurements on uru@xmath0si@xmath0 , lending further support for the suggestion that the low temperature phase of this material is a usdw .",
    "we also believe that the same mechanism may apply for the pseudogap phase in htsc@xcite , suggesting that it is not ucdw , but usdw instead .",
    "this is further corroborated by the optical dichroism observed in this phase@xcite .",
