    "the superconductivity of 60-derived solids owes its origin in part to features of the vibrational spectrum   of 60 .",
    "consequently , a microscopic understanding of superconductivity requires an understanding of the vibrational modes .",
    "while there have previously been detailed computational studies  @xcite yielding vibrational frequencies in excellent agreement with experiment , additional insight into the nature of modes can be obtained by comparing the vibrational spectrum of quasi - spherical 60 with that of its continuum analog : a thin , elastic , spherical shell .",
    "the electronic structure of 60 has been previously described in a similiar fashion , where 60 is thought of roughly as a spherical system with continuous rotational symmetry , invariant under the group @xmath7 .",
    "this leads to electronic multiplets , labeled by @xmath8 with degeneracy @xmath9 .",
    "the true molecule has only discrete icosahedral ( @xmath10 ) symmetry ; and , as is commonly done in crystal field theory , a correspondence can be made between the multiplets under the approximate high symmetry group and their descendants under the lower symmetry .",
    "this correspondence between orbitals under @xmath7 and orbitals under @xmath10 was made by haddon  @xcite the @xmath7 multiplets order with energy increasing with increasing @xmath8 , implying that the energy scale associated with changes in radial quantum number , @xmath11 , is much larger than the rotational energy scale , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the length scale of the spherical potential and @xmath14 is the electron mass .",
    "the most energetic of the 60 @xmath15-electrons therefore occupy the @xmath16 multiplet .    under the lower symmetry",
    "@xmath10 , multiplets of the spherical model for @xmath17 are split under @xmath10 , as icosahedral symmetry can not support an orbital degeneracy larger than 5 . for the occupied orbitals , these gaps are smaller than the spacing between adjacent @xmath8 multiplets ; consequently , the correlation between @xmath8 multiplets and nearly degenerate manifolds in 60 is clear .",
    "we expect the comparison of vibrations of an elastic shell to that of the 60 molecule to give qualitative insight , but we certainly do not expect close quantitative agreement .",
    "the continuum elastic approximation is only justified for the lowest frequency modes such that @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a typical nearest - neighbor distance , and @xmath20 is the transverse speed of sound on the shell .",
    "furthermore , the linear elastic approximation assumes only local interactions .",
    "it is known that for force constant models to get good agreement with the experimentally measured vibrations of 60 , it is necessary to include up to third - nearest neighbor interactions.@xcite hence , a linear elastic model would not expect to yield good quantitative agreement with experiment over the entire spectrum . nevertheless , to deepen our understanding of the character of the complex modes of 60 , we find it useful to compare the molecular modes with those of an elastic spherical shell , where the eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies can be described by compact analytic expressions .",
    "we summarize the results obtained by lamb  @xcite concerning the vibrations of a thin spherical shell .",
    "the modes can be divided into two classes .",
    "modes of the first class have displacements which are purely tangential to the surface of the shell .",
    "we denote the @xmath8th of these shear modes by @xmath21 .",
    "the frequency spectrum of shear modes is given by    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the dimensionless frequency , @xmath24 @xmath13 is the radius of the shell , and @xmath20 is the transverse speed of sound on the shell .",
    "we note that @xmath23 monotonically increases with increasing @xmath8 , and the lowest frequency shear mode has @xmath25 .",
    "the modes of the second class have displacements which have radial character . of these mixed modes , the @xmath26 mode is purely radial .",
    "its dimensionless frequency is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is related to the poisson ratio of the shell @xmath29 , @xmath30 the poisson ratio being the dimensionless ratio of transverse compression to longitudinal extension .",
    "the mixed modes with @xmath31 have displacements with both radial and tangential character .",
    "the dimensionless frequency of the @xmath32 mode is @xmath33    in the case of mixed modes with @xmath34 , each frequency has two branches whose frequencies are @xmath35^{1\\over 2 } \\label{m-}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 .",
    "we denote the mixed modes by @xmath37 .",
    "we plot selected shell frequencies as a function of the poisson ratio in figs.[hy2 ] and [ hy01 ] .",
    "we establish correlations between the modes of the shell and the modes of 60 . the breathing mode of 60 ( @xmath38 ) can be unambiguously matched with its counterpart mode of the shell , the mixed mode @xmath39 .",
    "both modes have exclusively radial character and transform as the trivial representation of their respective symmetry groups .",
    "60 has another mode preserving the icosahedral symmetry , but with pure tangential character  @xcite .",
    "we note that the decomposition of @xmath40 representation under @xmath10 contains @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath42 mode is predominantly a descendant of the @xmath43 shell mode .",
    "the lowest frequency mode of the shell , @xmath44 , has a degeneracy of 5 . under @xmath10",
    ", we expect this degeneracy to still be supported . experimentally , the lowest frequency mode of 60 , the so - called squashing mode @xmath45 , has mixed displacement character  @xcite and the same degeneracy as the @xmath44 mode on the shell ; thus , we infer that they are correlated .",
    "the next lowest frequency mode of the shell , @xmath46 , has a degeneracy of 7 , which decomposes under @xmath10 into @xmath47 and @xmath48 modes .",
    "we correlate @xmath46 with the nearly degenerate multiplet @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "similarly , the @xmath51 and @xmath52 levels must have evolved primarily from the splitting of the @xmath53 mode .",
    "as the @xmath54 shell mode must remain unsplit , we correlate it with a @xmath55 type mode under @xmath10 .",
    "there are two @xmath55 modes which are close in frequency . from stereographic projections  @xcite of the modes ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath56 is primarily a descendant of @xmath54 , while @xmath57 results from the splitting of the @xmath58 mode .    for @xmath59 ,",
    "mixed shell modes have small spacings compared to the splittings under @xmath10 .",
    "there are no real predominant `` progenitor '' levels , as mixing among many shell modes must be involved in determining the final character of the displacements .",
    "we summarize our low frequency correlations in fig .",
    "[ corr ] .",
    "the spectrum of the shell results from one structural parameter and two elastic parameters .",
    "we adjust the elastic parameters to fit to the low frequency portion of the spectrum .",
    "we use a value of 3.56    for @xmath13 , as obtained from experiment .",
    "we estimate the following parameter values from a fit to the @xmath38 and @xmath60 modes using eqs .",
    "[ m0 ] and [ shearf ] : @xmath61 and @xmath62 m / s .",
    "we choose to fit to these modes as their correlation with shell modes is clear , and they stem from multiplets whose degeneracy is preserved under @xmath10 .    combining eqs .",
    "[ m0 ] and [ m1 ] , we observe that @xmath63 _ independent _ of elastic parameters .",
    "based on our correlation diagram , we can compare this ratio to experiment .",
    "we use the value of 493 @xmath64 for @xmath65  @xcite , and a value of 577 @xmath64 for @xmath66@xcite to obtain a ratio of @xmath67 .",
    "the reasonable agreement with @xmath68 gives support to the interpretation of these modes as progenitors of the @xmath69 and @xmath70 modes .",
    "a comparison of selected spherical model frequencies to experimental frequencies is given in table i. perhaps the real utility of the correlations made is that the known analytic forms of the eigenmodes might be used to approximate displacement fields in calculations .",
    "we thank f.  anderson , w.  leenstra , and j.  wu for valuable discussions .",
