    "it is based on turbulence , differential rotation and helical gas flows , driven by supernova explosions ( gressel et al .",
    "@xcite ) and cosmic rays ( hanasz et al .",
    "the mean - field dynamo in galaxy disks predicts that within a few @xmath2  yr large - scale regular fields are excited from the seed fields ( arshakian et al .",

    "most of what we know about galactic magnetic fields comes through the detection of radio waves .",
    "the intensity of _ synchrotron emission _  is a measure of the number density of cosmic - ray electrons and of the strength of the total magnetic field component in the sky plane .",
    "the assumption of energy equipartition between the total cosmic rays and total magnetic fields allows us to calculate the total magnetic field strength from the synchrotron intensity ( beck & krause @xcite ) .",
    "polarized emission originates from ordered fields .",
    "as polarization `` vectors '' are ambiguous by @xmath3 , they can not distinguish _ regular ( coherent ) fields _ , defined to have a constant direction within the telescope beam , from _ anisotropic fields _ , which are generated from turbulent fields by compressing or shearing gas flows , so that their direction frequently reverses perpendicular to the flow direction .",
    "unpolarized synchrotron emission indicates _ turbulent fields _ which have random directions .",
    "the intrinsic degree of linear polarization of synchrotron emission is about 75% .",
    "the observed degree of polarization is smaller due to the contribution of unpolarized thermal emission , by _ faraday depolarization _  along the line of sight and across the beam ( sokoloff et al .",
    "@xcite ) and by geometrical depolarization due to variations of the field orientation within the beam .    at radio wavelengths of a few centimeters and below , the orientation of the observed b  vector is parallel to the field orientation , so that the magnetic patterns of many galaxies can be mapped directly ( e.g. beck @xcite ) . at longer wavelengths , the observed polarization vector is rotated in a magnetized thermal plasma by _",
    "faraday rotation_. the rotation angle increases with the square of the wavelength @xmath4 and with the _ rotation measure ( rm ) _ , which is the integral of the plasma density and the strength of the component of the field along the line of sight . as the rotation angle is sensitive to the sign of the field direction , only regular fields give rise to faraday rotation , while anisotropic and random fields do not .",

    "the pattern of field lines in ngc  1097 is similar to that of the gas streamlines as obtained in numerical simulations ( athanassoula @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the ordered magnetic field is aligned with the flow and amplified by shear .",
    "remarkably , the optical image of ngc  1097 shows dust filaments in the upstream region which are aligned with the ordered field ( fig .",

    "the field lines smoothly change their orientation by almost @xmath5 .",
    "the ordered field is also hardly compressed , probably coupled to the diffuse gas and strong enough to affect its flow ( beck et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the polarization pattern in barred galaxies can be used as a tracer of shearing gas flows in the sky plane and complements spectroscopic measurements of radial velocities .",
    "barred galaxies can create a gas reservoir and starburst in the central kiloparsec , fuelling an agn needs other processes ( e.g. davies et al .",

    "this is supported by an investigation of the @xmath11-ray and radio emission from the starburst galaxies m  82 and ngc  253 which suggests that most of the radio emission is from secondaries undergoing strong bremsstrahlung and ionization losses ( lacki et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "one of the key problems of agn physics is how to fuel the nucleus with gas from the central region , which needs outwards transport of angular momentum ( davies et al .",
    "magnetic fields can help here .",

    "it has a diameter of about 1.5kpc and an active nucleus in its center ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n1097_center ] ) .",
    "the nonthermal and weakly polarized radio emission is a signature of strong turbulent magnetic fields ( beck et al .",

    "this yields :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the scale height of the gas , @xmath22 the strength of the turbulent field and @xmath23 that of the ordered field .",
    "the correlation between @xmath24 and @xmath25 is generated by shear from differential rotation .",
    "for ngc  1097 , @xmath26pc , @xmath27km / s at 1kpc radius , @xmath2850@xmath7 g and @xmath2910@xmath7 g give an inflow rate of several @xmath30/yr , which is sufficient to fuel the activity of the nucleus of this galaxy ( beck et al .",

    "equipartition between the energy densities of cosmic rays and magnetic fields yields :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the total field strength , @xmath33 is the radio synchrotron intensity which is proportional to the infrared intensity @xmath34 ( the radio - infrared correlation ) and hence to the star - formation rate @xmath35 .",
    "the relation between the bolometric luminosity of agns @xmath36 and the @xmath35 of their hosts ( e.g. trakhtenbrot & netzer @xcite ) can be explained by this scenario .",
    "the relation between the accretion rate and sfr ( eq .",
    "3 ) should be tested with a sample of galaxies .",

    "its pitch angle agrees with that of the spiral filaments seen in dust and h@xmath37 ( prieto et al .",

    "infrared observations indicate that star formation in the hosts of the most luminous agns peaked at @xmath38 and decreased at later epochs ( serjeant et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which is consistent with the evolution of the accretion rate onto supermassive black holes ( trakhtenbrot et al .",

    "its high inclination of @xmath39 allows observing the extraplanar emission . the bright radio halo ( fig .",

    "this is interpreted as the faraday rotation of the polarized emission from the background disk by the helical field in the walls of the outflow extending to at least 1.2kpc from the center ( fig .",

    "[ fig : n253_center ] ) .",
    "the northern outflow cone is located behind the disk , so that its x - ray emission is mostly absorbed and can not faraday - rotate the radio emission .",
    "the galaxy ngc  3079 hosts an energetic wind - driven outflow which extends 3kpc above and below the plane ( duric & seaquist @xcite ) and emits strong and highly polarized synchrotron emission , in contrast to ngc  253 .",

    "this process connects the star formation activity to the accretion rate and could be important for the formation of supermassive black holes . ordered fields as observed by polarized radio emission may trace the direction of gas in- and outflows .",
    "results have been obtained so far only for radio - bright and nearby galaxies .",
