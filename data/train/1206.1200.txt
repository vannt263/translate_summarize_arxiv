    "the period distribution of close binary star systems ( e.g. devor 2005 ; derekas et al .",
    "2007 ) contains important information on binary formation and evolutionary processes .",
    "observations have revealed that there is a sharp cut - off in the period distribution at @xmath50.22 days ( e.g. rucinski 1992 , norton et al .",
    "2011 ) , and very few binaries have thus far been discovered with significantly shorter periods ( gsc 2314 - 0530 0.192 days ; dimitrov & kjurkchieva 2010 and ogle bw3 v38 0.198 days ; maceroni & montalban 2004 ) .",
    "searching for binaries beyond this cut - off is interesting because their frequency of occurence , and the ratio of detached versus contact binary systems , provide direct constraints on theories that model the formation and migration history of low - mass stars , a mass regime that has been fairly poorly characterised so far .",
    "it has even been proposed that very short period low - mass binaries could be the progenitors of stellar mergers which may lead to the observed population of very hot jupiters ( martin et al .",
    "2011 ) , and which could explain events such as nova sco 2008 , where a contact binary with an orbital period of 1.4 days merged into a single star ( tylenda et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "there are several theories that aim to explain the observed cut - off and the apparent lack of systems beyond it . in the first theory ,",
    "near - contact binaries are formed from initially well - detached systems that undergo angular momentum loss ( aml ) via a magnetised wind on gyr timescales .",
    "evidence for such winds , especially in low - mass , short - period binary systems , is provided by observations of extensive cool spot coverage , rapid rotation in tidally locked orbits , strong h@xmath6 emission , flares and high activity rates ( e.g. morales et al .",
    "2010 , vida et al .",
    "stepien ( 1995 ; 2006 ; 2011 ) estimated the timescale required for the components of a detached binary to both reach roche - lobe overflow through aml , i.e. to become a contact binary .",
    "he proposed that the aml timescale is much longer for low - mass systems , such that m - dwarf binaries ( except in the most extreme mass - ratio cases ) can not reach roche - lobe overflow within the age of the universe .",
    "the 0.22 day cut - off therefore corresponds to a lower limit in total binary mass of @xmath51.0 - 1.2@xmath7 for contact systems .",
    "however , detached low - mass ultra - short period binary systems are also extremely difficult to form by this mechanism . in section 2",
    ", we will further explain and quantify the aml evolution for m - dwarf binaries .",
    "proposing an alternative theory , jiang et al .",
    "( 2011 ) suggest that an instability in mass transfer , when the primary fills its roche lobe , is responsible for the observed short - period cut - off .",
    "this instability is predicted to occur if the primary star has a significant convection zone , implying that binaries with a primary mass lower than 0.63@xmath7 would merge too quickly to form stable contact systems . in this scheme ,",
    "m - dwarf binaries in the contact phase are short - lived and are therefore extremely rare .",
    "unlike the aml model of stepien ( 2011 ) , detached low - mass short - period binaries are permitted in the mass transfer instability model because its timescale for angular momentum loss is significantly shorter .    however , third - body interactions in the birth environment may be responsible for accelerating the orbital evolution of low - mass binaries beyond the previous predictions . here",
    ", energy is drained from the binary by either ejection of the lowest - mass companion in a low - n ` mini - cluster ' ( e.g. reipurth & clarke 2001 , goodwin et al .",
    "2004 ) or through the kozai mechanism ( e.g. eggleton & kiseleva 2001 , fabrycky & tremaine 2007 ) .",
    "interestingly , an adaptive optics search for companions around solar - mass contact systems by rucinski et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that the fraction of short - period binaries in hierarchical triples is at least 59%(@xmath88% ) ( see also tokovinin et al .",
    "2006 ) , indicating that a significant amount of short - period binaries are found in triple systems .    with these competing scenarios in mind ,",
    "it is interesting to characterise the low - mass m - dwarf population of ultra short - period binaries . although m - dwarfs form the most common stellar population in our galaxy ( @xmath570% by number ; henry et al .",
    "1997 ) , their intrinsic faintness is a challenge when trying to obtain a sufficiently large m - dwarf sample from a magnitude limited optical survey in order to study their binary characteristics . in this paper",
    "we describe a search for the shortest period eclipsing binary systems in the wfcam transit survey ( wts ) down to @xmath9=18 .",
    "the wts is an infrared photometric monitoring survey running on the 3.8 m united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) with its main goal to find planets transiting m - dwarfs . because m - dwarf spectral energy distributions ( seds ) peak in the infrared , the wts is sensitive to redder eclipsing systems , with a significant population of binary systems down to @xmath5m5 .",
    "in section 2 we will expand on our motivation of this work . in section 3",
    "we describe our observations and data reduction , including the wts survey itself and low resolution spectroscopic follow - up of some of the candidates . in section 4",
    "we use a variability statistic to find stars with correlated variability and select eclipsing binary candidates from the wts data .",
    "we subsequently determine orbital periods using box - fitting and fourier techniques . with simple colour cuts",
    "we then pre - select binaries with primary mass @xmath10 ( k5 ) . in section 5",
    "we obtain estimates of the binary effective temperature through broadband sed fitting and spectral template matching . by fitting fourier series to the data we identify ( semi-)detached and contact systems . in section 6 ,",

    "this activity is expected to cause the loss of angular momentum through a magnetised wind of material that is forced to co - rotate with the star .",
    "the rotation rate of a star is found to correlate with the activity .",
    "young active stars rotate rapidly but their rotation slows down with time leading to a decrease in their activity ( e.g. irwin et al .",
    "2011 ) . in a close binary , with synchronised orbits and spins , the angular momentum loss due to",
    "the spin - down of the individual stars causes a decrease of the binary orbital angular momentum , which tightens the orbit , but this then spins up the stars .",
    "a popular scenario is that when given enough time , the loss of angular momentum will bring the two stars into contact .",
    "stepien ( 1995 , 2006 , 2011 ) estimated timescales required for a detached binary to reach roche - lobe overflow through aml and to evolve into a contact system , concluding that for a solar - type , equal - mass binary with a starting separation that corresponds to a period @xmath14=2.0 days this timescale is @xmath56.5gyr .",
    "he proposed that the aml timescale is significantly longer for decreasing mass systems and that therefore roche - lobe overflow will not occur within the hubble time for binaries with an initial primary mass of less than @xmath50.7@xmath7 , again assuming an initial orbital period of 2.0 days ( an assumption which is further explained below ) .",
    "the 0.22 day period cut would therefore correspond to a lower limit on the total mass of contact systems of 1.0 - 1.2@xmath7 ( i.e. a binary consisting of two m0 dwarfs ) .",
    "this suggests that evolution timescales are too long for m - dwarf binaries to decay into tight orbits within the age of the universe .",
    "one solution to this is to choose a shorter starting period ( @xmath14 ) . to calculate the orbital evolution for m - dwarfs , and to investigate this evolution for different starting periods and mass ratios , we equate the change in the total binary orbital angular momentum ( @xmath15 ) , which scales with the orbital frequency @xmath16 as @xmath17 , to the change in the sum of spin angular momenta ( @xmath18 ) for the binary components , @xmath19 , following the derivation in section 3 of stepien ( 1995 ) .",
    "we assume that mass - loss is small over the hubble time for m - dwarfs and that the orbit remains circular and synchronised throughout binary evolution .",
    "the change in the orbital period as function of time can then be written as : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is constant with time and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the radii and masses of the primary and secondary binary components .",
    "this equation has the solution : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the starting period at formation ( in days ) and p(t ) is the observed orbital period at time t.    in panel a ) of figure [ bigfig ] we show the orbital evolution of m - dwarfs , assuming @xmath14=2.0 days and q(=@xmath26)=1.0 , plotted for decreasing primary stellar mass from 0.7 to 0.2@xmath27 in steps of 0.1@xmath13 . in the same panel",
    ", we show the evolution for m - dwarfs with q=0.3 ( grey dashed curves ) .",
    "binary evolution is significantly faster for low - mass ratio systems .",
    "clearly , unless a low mass - ratio is assumed , there is insufficient aml over the hubble time for any m - dwarf binary to reach contact . in panel b ) of figure [ bigfig ] we plot the same binary evolution for m - dwarfs but with @xmath14=1.0 day , showing that a shorter starting period results in faster evolution .    in panels",
    "c ) through e ) of figure [ bigfig ] we show the time required to reach contact as a function of primary mass assuming @xmath14=2.0 , 1.5 , and 1.0 days for mass ratios q=1.0 , 0.7 , and 0.3 .",
    "clearly , in the @xmath14=1.0 day model , evolution is much faster and q=1 systems with primaries more massive than @xmath50.35@xmath13 could be brought into contact within the hubble time .",
    "this means that the upper limit on the total mass of contact systems would shift to masses corresponding to later - type m - dwarfs , assuming that the formation mechanism for such binaries is the same as that of earlier - type stars .",
    "also , even for a 0.5 + 0.5@xmath13 binary the evolution timescale is @xmath58 gyrs in the fastest model , which would mean that such binaries would be some of the oldest objects in our current universe .",
    "we have calculated what @xmath14 is minimally required to bring a given m - dwarf binary into a given orbital period today , within a given time - frame .",
    "we show this as a function of primary mass , derived using equation 2 , in figure [ p0plot ] for equal - mass binaries , assuming observed orbits of 0.10 , 0.15 , 0.20 and 0.25 days .",
    "for example , a minimum starting period of @xmath14=1.0 day is required for a 0.3 + 0.3@xmath13 binary to reach @xmath28=0.2 days within the hubble time .",
    "for a typical 5.0 gyr thin disk binary , the required @xmath14 is 0.4 days for the same system . clearly , to constrain aml theory ,",
    "it is vital to assess from observations what is the actual frequency of ( ultra)short - period m - dwarf binaries .",
    "although shorter starting periods could at least partly explain the existance of ultra - short period m - dwarf systems within the aml framework , binaries with these short starting periods should then be found abundantly in young cluster environments . however , pre - main sequence binary progenitors with @xmath292.5 days appear to be very rare , with 4 currently observed .",
    "hd15555 ( a g5+k1 in a 1.7 day orbit ) , mml53 ( a g2+k2 in a 2.1 day orbit ) , v4046sgr ( k5+k7;2.42 days ) and 155913 - 2233 ( k5+k5;2.42 days ) are the only known ( melo et al . 2000 ,",
    "hebb et al .",
    "also , contact binaries of any spectral type are extremely rare in open clusters younger than @xmath54 gyr , only txcnc ( 0.38 day orbit ; zhang et al . 2009 ) is linked to the intermediate - age open cluster preasepe ( @xmath5600 myr ) .",
    "cargile et al .",
    "( 2008 ) report the discovery of a 4.7 day eclipsing pre - main sequence m - dwarf with masses 0.39 and 0.40@xmath13 , which suggests that shorter - period pre - main sequence m - dwarfs are not subject to observational bias .",
    "the minimum possible orbital separation of a close binary during the fragmentation of a protostellar cloud is an important constraint on the assumed @xmath14 as it prevents explaining ultra - short period binaries as simply forming very close together .",
    "this is because t - tauri stars of subsolar mass have radii of @xmath52 - 3@xmath30 ( baraffe et al .",
    "a pile - up of detached binaries with periods of 2 - 3 days is also expected because the kozai mechanism in a triple system can effectively produce such binaries within 50 myrs ( e.g. fabrycky and tremaine 2007 ) , but is less efficient for shorter periods .",
    "we approximately estimate the shortest possible @xmath14 assuming pre - main sequence stellar radii using baraffe ( 1998 ) 1.0 myr models ( the thick black solid curve in figure [ p0plot ] ) .",
    "note that for the lowest mass m - dwarfs no @xmath14 can yield very short - period binaries .",
    "this makes it difficult to justify any starting period of @xmath311.5 days .",

    "the roche period is also a function of @xmath35 ; for a 0.6@xmath13 system with q=0.8 , @xmath34 is @xmath50.13 days and @xmath50.07 days for a q=0.5 system .",
    "this indicates that binaries with lower q have even shorter @xmath34 . the dotted curve in figure [ orbit ]",
    "is computed from the expression for the radius of a tidally and rotationally deformed roche - lobe filling star ( knigge et al .",
    "2011 , section 5.2.2 ) .",
    "for such a star @xmath34 is higher because the equilibrium radius of each star is now affected by the deformation .",
    "note that there is still considerable uncertainty in the mass , radius,@xmath36 , spectral type calibration ( e.g. baraffe & chabrier 1996 ) , and magnetic activity may be a contributing factor to radius inflation in a tight low mass binary system ( e.g. rozyczka et al . 2009 ) , which in turn increases the length of @xmath34 .    therefore , to critically test the predictions of aml and other paradigms",
    ", it is essential to determine from observations the abundance of m - dwarf binaries that are near contact , i.e. binary stars which are expected to have ultra - short orbital periods on the order of only a few hours . because of the intrinsic faintness of m - dwarfs and the strong line broadening induced by rapid stellar rotation it is difficult to find such binaries using data from current radial velocity surveys .",
    "we therefore present the results of a campaign utilising photometric measurements obtained by the wfcam transit survey , which has both the cadence and sensitivity to detect and characterise ultra - short period binaries in the uncharted m - dwarf regime .",
    "the wfcam transit survey ( wts ) is an ongoing photometric monitoring campaign operating on the 3.8 m united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) at mauna kea , hawaii , since august 2007 .",

    "the wts observing strategy uses the queue - schedule mode of ukirt and can operate in mediocre seeing and thin cloud cover .",

    "for this reason , we have not investigated any lightcurves with @xmath5318 .      to determine periods for all binary candidates we adopt a simple box - fitting algorithm ( kovacs et al .",
    "2002 ) , such as used by collier - cameron et al .",
    "we limit our search to @xmath540.1 days because our frequency spectra are very noisy at the shortest periods , which we suspect is due to strong aliasing caused by the peculiar form of the wts window function .",

    "we phase - fold the lightcurves over 20,000 periods between 0.1 and 1.0 days and for every period we vary the primary eclipse epoch @xmath55 and box width , and calculated the error - weighted signal compared to white noise ( s / n ) .",
    "we then refined our analysis by selecting the period and epoch with the highest significance and re - iterate the box - fitting procedure with a smaller range of parameters , centered around the frequency peak . in this way",

    "our results imply that for m - dwarf binaries the orbital periods can extend significantly beyond the proposed period cut - off of @xmath50.22 days . for our ( near-)contact m - dwarf system 19b-3 - 06008 ,",
    "the fitted @xmath953150 k , which corresponds to a mass of 0.15 - 0.25@xmath13 , implies that there is insufficient angular momentum loss over the hubble time within the aml framework to explain the observed orbital period with starting periods of @xmath14=2.0 - 1.5 days . for the @xmath14=1.0 day model and a mass - ratio of @xmath50.3",
    "the contact timescale is of the order of the hubble time .",
    "however , the near - equal ratio of secondary to primary eclipse depths suggests that this binary is rather near - equal - mass , unless the secondary is extremely bloated in radius with respect to its mass . also , a mass - ratio of 0.3 and a primary mass of 0.2@xmath13 would bring the secondary mass uncomfortably close to the hydrogen burning limit , whereas an intrinsically dark and low - mass secondary such as a brown dwarf would be unlikely to produce the observed secondary eclipse depth and the out - of - eclipse variations . again , for the other three ultra - short period binaries only the @xmath14=1.0 day model can reproduce the observed orbits for the estimated primary mass , under the requirement that we assume @xmath96 and/or an extreme mass ratio , the latter which may be the case for 19h-3 - 14922 ( where we estimate that q could be as low as 0.5 ) .",
    "given our estimates of the minimum birth separation for m - dwarfs ( figure [ p0plot ] ) , it seems unlikely that these binaries were formed at such short periods .",
    "another possibility is that the evolution of m - dwarf binaries is faster than expected .",
    "m - dwarfs are known to be active and flaring stars .",
    "west et al . ( 2011 ) find an activity fraction of 40 - 80% for m4-m9 dwarfs , which implies that scaling solar type stars to m - dwarfs is not trivial .",
    "it is possible that because of the ( near-)convective nature of mid - to - late type m - dwarfs that the ultra - short periods of our binaries , when synchronised with the stellar rotation , cause the magnetic field lines to be significantly twisted ( the @xmath97 dynamo ; radler et al .",
    "in other words , the topology of the magnetic fields could be significantly different from that of solar - type stars , which may directly affect the overall activity and as a consequence the rate at which angular momentum is lost .",
    "alternatively , the formation mechanism for m - dwarfs may be different from that of earlier type main sequence stars .",
    "it is possible that during the pre - main sequence phase an excess amount of angular momentum is removed which accelerates the orbital evolution .",
    "possible sources of such enhanced evolution could be dynamical interactions with other stars , accretion of the surrounding material and/or interaction with a circumbinary disk ( pringle 1991 ; artymowicz et al . 1991 ; bate & bonnell 1997 ) .",
    "the hydrodynamical calculations of binary formation by fragmentation of bate et al .",

    "less is known about the later phases of orbital evolution . in this paper",
    ", we have demonstrated that periods of @xmath51.0 day would be required at early age to explain the observed ultra - short periods for our m - dwarf binaries , if magnetic braking is the dominant mechanism by which low - mass stars evolve over gyrs timescales .",
    "recall that jiang et al .",
    "( 2011 ) concluded that contact m - dwarf binaries ( primary mass @xmath00.63@xmath7 ) are short - lived and thus detections of them during this ` special ' phase of their evolution would be rare .",
    "this is because they predict an instability in mass - transfer at the point at which the primary fills its roche lobe which merges the system almost instantaneously . in combination with the findings by ge et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , who show that the instability of mass transfer occurs promptly upon roche lobe filling of the primary ( a semi - detached binary ) for stars with a significant convection zone , it seems that the existance of our new near - contact m - dwarf systems , 19b-3 - 06008 and 07g-3 - 05744 , among @xmath510,000 m - dwarf sources in the wts survey , is unusual .",
    "however , detached short - period low - mass binaries are allowed in this model , because the angular momentum loss timescale is significantly shorter than in the stepien aml model for m - dwarfs .",
    "our detached ultra - short period systems , 17d-3 - 02440 and 19h-3 - 14922 , thus appear to fit within the jiang et al .",
    "model predictions .",
    "in this paper we have presented the results of an extensive search for short - period low - mass eclipsing binary systems in the near - infrared j - band lightcurves of the wfcam transit survey .",
    "probing over 10,000 m - dwarfs down to j=18 we report on the discovery of four ultra - short period ( p@xmath00.18 days ) m - dwarf binaries .",
    "their periods are significantly shorter than of any other known main - sequence binary system .",
    "all four are below the observed sharp period cut - off at @xmath1 days as seen in binaries of earlier type stars .",
    "the shortest - period binary consists of two m4 type stars in a @xmath2 day orbit . in total",

    "5 are indicated as potential contact systems .",
    "these detections pose a direct challenge to popular theories that explain the evolution of short period binaries by loss of angular momentum through magnetised winds , or by unstable mass - transfer , which predict timescales that are either too long for their formation , or timescales that are too short to observe them in the contact phase .",
    "our discovery of binaries with significantly shorter orbital periods than the previously observed cut - off implies that either these timescales have been overestimated for m - dwarfs , e.g. due to a higher effective magnetic activity , or that the mechanism for forming these tight m - dwarf binaries is different from that of earlier type main - sequence stars .",

    "<S> the evolution of short period binaries of cool main - sequence stars is driven by loss of angular momentum through magnetised winds . in this scheme , the observed @xmath40.22 day period cut - off is explained as being due to timescales that are too long for lower - mass binaries to decay into tighter orbits . </S>",
    "<S> our discovery of low - mass binaries with significantly shorter orbits implies that either these timescales have been overestimated for m - dwarfs , e.g. due to a higher effective magnetic activity , or that the mechanism for forming these tight m - dwarf binaries is different from that of earlier type main - sequence stars .    </S>",
