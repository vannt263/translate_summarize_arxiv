    "when classifying dwarf galaxies , it is commonly stated in the literature that gas rich dwarf irregular ( dirr ) galaxies are the low luminosity tail of the spiral galaxy hubble tuning fork classification sequence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if this hypothesis is correct , then one would expect these objects to be intrinsically disk shaped like the more massive spiral galaxies . if one assumes that dirr galaxies are , in fact , disks and if those disks are randomly distributed across the sky , then the projected minor - to - major axis ratios ( _ b / a _ ) and the corresponding derived inclination angles should follow a similar statistical distribution as for the spiral disk galaxies . however , this is not what previous studies have shown and different groups have interpreted the inconclusive results to mean different things . @xcite and @xcite surmized that their observed _ b / a _ statistical distributions implied that dirr galaxies are thick disks .",
    "others have interpreted the distribution as evidence of a triaxial nature @xcite , only a little less spherical than dwarf ellipticals @xcite .",
    "recent studies by @xcite assume galaxies are oblate spheroids and find a trend in disk thickness with galaxy mass ; dirr galaxies are thinnest near stellar mass m@xmath3 @xmath4 2@xmath510@xmath6  and thicken on either side of this mass .",
    "in contrast , @xcite made no assumption on the intrinsic shapes and found that dirr disks thicken with decreasing luminosity ; the most massive , brightest dirr systems have the thinnest disks and the disks thicken as luminosity decreases .    in order to resolve the _ b / a _ controversy and to determine if a disk thickness with luminosity trend does , in fact , exist , a more robust method for measuring the three - dimensional shape of dirr systems is necessary .",
    "the stellar kinematics , in particular , the central ( @xmath7 ) stellar velocity dispersion perpendicular to the disk , @xmath0 , combined with the maximum rotation speed , , usually determined from  kinematics , produces a kinematic measure , /@xmath0 . if an object is a disk , then it will be dominated by rotation and supported by angular momentum (  @xmath8 ) @xcite ; on the other hand , a triaxial system is pressure supported and , therefore , dominated by the random motions of the stars (  @xmath9 ) .",
    "thus , a spiral galaxy disk has /@xmath0",
    "@xmath8 1 , usually between two and five @xcite , and triaxial systems such as giant elliptical and dwarf elliptical ( de ) galaxies have /@xmath0 @xmath10 1 @xcite .",
    "thus , /@xmath0 is a definitive method for understanding the intrinsic three - dimensional shape of a galaxy .",
    "there is evidence in the literature that dirr galaxies may be an earlier evolutionary stage of dsph and de systems . through ram pressure stripping , harassment , tidal forces , and other interaction mayhem",
    ", dirr galaxies may morph into de , like the ones found in the virgo cluster that contain embedded stellar disks @xcite , or they may become dsph systems like those observed around the milky way and m31 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , dirr galaxies may be innately triaxial , or , through interaction processes , dirr systems may transform from a rotationally supported disk to a triaxial pressure supported system . by studying the stellar and gas kinematics of nearby dirr galaxies , we may get a glimpse of the potential mechanism(s ) for transforming a dirr system into de or dsph systems .",

    "the stellar kinematics for our galaxies were obtained using the kitt peak national observatory s ( kpno ) mayall 4-meter telescope with the echelle spectrograph .",
    "we obtained long - slit , two - dimensional optical spectra centered on the mg ib triplet along four position angles ( pas ) per galaxy : major axis , minor axis , and @xmath2 45@xmath48 to the major axis .",
    "the  gas kinematics are from high spatial and spectral resolution data obtained with the national radio astronomy observatory s ( nrao ) karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) . the data for ddo 46 and ddo 168 are from little things ( local irregulars that trace luminosity extremes ; the  nearby galaxy survey ) @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : optspec ] describes the observations , data reductions , and analysis for the optical spectra ; section [ sec : hispec ] describes the data and analysis for the  spectroscopy ; section [ sec : results ] explores the results ; section [ sec : discuss ] is our discussion section ; section [ sec : sumcon ] presents the summary and outlines the conclusions .",

    "figure [ fig:1 ] also includes the outermost @xmath49band intensity contour , which is what is used to identify the morphological semi - major ( @xmath50 ) and semi - minor ( @xmath51 ) axes for each object .",

    "see table [ tab:1 ] for the respective _ b / a _ and @xmath52 values .    both galaxies were observed with the kpno mayall 4-meter telescope and echelle spectrograph .",
    "ddo 46 was scheduled for six nights in 2010 january along the major and minor morphological axes , but due to rainy , cloudy weather , only one night has usable data .",
    "ddo 168 was observed for two nights in 2008 february along the major axis and then again in 2009 april and it was observed in all four pas , morphological major and minor axes and intermediate angles @xmath245@xmath48 from the major axis .",
    "the weather for all of the nights we observed ddo 168 was superb , with the exception of 3 feb 2008 where some clouds reduced the data quality .",
    "table [ tab:2 ] shows a summary of the observations .",
    "we used the 4-meter@xmath18echelle spectrograph as a 3@xmath1 long - slit , two - dimensional spectrograph by replacing the cross - disperser with a mirror flat .",
    "we opened the slit to 2@xmath54 in order to maximize throughput while maintaining high spectral resolution .",
    "the average seeing at the kpno 4-meter telescope during our observing run in april 2009 for ddo 168 was quite good and generally less than 2@xmath54 , although there was one night when the seeing worsened and may have been about this .",
    "the cloudy , rainy weather conditions that plagued our observing run in january 2010 for ddo 46 made for poor seeing conditions and during some nights caused seeing to jump above 2@xmath54 .",
    "thus , the point spread function ( psf ) of the template stars in the case of ddo 46 and on one night with ddo 168 were comparable to the slit - width and , thus , the spectral fwhm of the stars were observed under comparable slit - illumination conditions as the galaxy .",
    "however , on the other ddo 168 nights the spectral fwhm of the stars was set by the seeing .",
    "this may potentially lead to an overestimate of the line - of - sight velocity dispersions obtained for the galaxies .",
    "however , this effect is likely minimal because a comparison of the fwhm of the stars on nights of good seeing are @xmath9 15% different compared to the fwhm of stars observed under poorer seeing conditions .",
    "we targeted the strong mg ib stellar absorption features at 5167.3  , 5172.7  , and 5183.6   by isolating a single order using a filter with a central wavelength of 5204   and full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 276  .",
    "these mg ib absorption features are easily detected because they are deep and this wavelength region is virtually free of telluric features .",
    "our setup produces a fwhm @xmath55 0.38   as measured from the central lines of th - ar comparison lamp exposures and gives a velocity resolution of @xmath422 , which corresponds to a velocity dispersion , @xmath56 , of @xmath49 .",
    "we acquired an angular pixel scale of 1@xmath57 pix@xmath22 , after binning by two pixels in the cross - dispersion direction , and a spectral pixel scale of 0.14   pix@xmath22 .",
    "on the first night of every observing run , we stepped a radial velocity standard star in equal spatial steps along the cross - dispersion direction of the slit in order to model the cross - dispersion curvature and to obtain the spatial pixel scale .",
    "we observed several radial velocity standard stars at the beginning and ending of every night and acquired comparison lamp exposures at each star location in order to accurately solve for the wavelength solution .",
    "table [ tab:3 ] lists all of the radial velocity standard stars observed each night along with their exposure times , spectral types and classes , magnitudes , coordinates , metallicities ( where available ) , and heliocentric radial velocities .",
    "we used these radial velocity standard stars in the milky way as templates and applied a cross - correlation method ( ccm ) to determine the velocities and intrinsic velocity dispersions of the stars in each galaxy .",
    "careful sky subtraction is essential to our analysis and this was achieved by observing equal amounts of time on the galaxy as blank sky near the target position .",
    "each night , we observed one pa of the galaxy and took several 1800 s exposures for each galaxy position and several 1800 s exposures of blank sky near the galaxy position in order to properly subtract sky .",
    "comparison lamp exposures were taken before and after each galaxy and sky exposure so that accurate wavelength calibration could be performed .",
    "all optical stellar spectra were reduced using the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) .",
    "we presented the detailed data reduction process in a companion paper on ngc 1569 and refer the reader to @xcite for more comprehensive information .",
    "thus , we only briefly outline the major steps taken in the data reduction process here .",
    "we began our data reductions by fitting for the overscan to remove the electronic pedestal in each image .",
    "then , we averaged and normalized 10 dome flats taken each night to correct our spectra for any pixel variations or imperfections from the instruments .",
    "we averaged and normalized a series of twilight sky flats to correct for illumination variations along the cross - dispersion direction of the slit .",
    "we took bias frames at the start of each observing run to ensure that there was no electronic noise pattern across the ccd but because no significant variations were observed , we did not use the bias exposures in our data reductions .",
    "we used the radial velocity standard star that was moved in equal spatial steps along the slit to correct for the slit curvature .",
    "we used comparison lamp exposures to find our wavelength solutions and found that our spectra are accurate to 0.4   for a given night , which enabled us to put all spectra for a night on a single wavelength scale .",
    "we co - added all of the galaxy exposures together to maximize signal - to - noise ( s / n ) and then subtracted the co - added sky exposures to produce a single , two - dimensional spectrum .",

    "this spatial summing process was necessary to produce adequate s / n in all of the one - dimensional spectra . to preserve the spatial resolution of the data for comparing the stellar and gas kinematics at a given location , we limited the spatial area summed to less than approximately three  beam widths ( see section [ sec : hidata ] ) . for ddo 168 , we summed 24@xmath58 ( 513 pc at a distance of 4.3 mpc ) to produce one - dimensional spectra along the morphological major axis and the two intermediate pas . for the data taken along the morphological minor axis",

    "we used these stellar templates to create our own template library and only the stars taken on the same night were used in the ccm .",
    "this was to ensure that we did not introduce any potential night to night variations .",
    "on the nights that we observed twilight flats , we extracted a solar spectrum for use as an additional template star in the ccm .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] shows examples of continuum subtracted , one - dimensional galaxy spectra along the major axes for ddo 46 , ddo 168 and a stellar template for comparison .",
    "the rest wavelengths of the mg ib triplet absorption features are marked for reference and the regions used in the ccm are shown by the black horizontal brackets .",
    "we used the iraf task fxcor @xcite to cross - correlate the galaxy spectra with the stellar template library from the same night .",
    "proper sky subtraction is critical to produce a high s / n cross - correlation peak .",
    "thus , we tested all of the available scaling functions in iraf in the co - adding process before , during , and after sky subtraction and analyzed the noise statistics and strength of the peak in the cross - correlation function to find the best sky - subtracted , extracted spectra .",
    "we explored the effects of various spectral regions used in the cross - correlation function making sure to avoid any residual sky lines .",
    "the main outcome from all of our tests is that the heliocentric radial velocities of the stars in the galaxy , be it ddo 46 or ddo 168 , as determined from fxcor , did not change by more than 10% regardless of which scaling function ( or none at all ) or spectral regions we used .",
    "we did , however , achieve a higher signal - to - noise cross - correlation peak depending on the quality of sky subtraction and avoidance of residual sky lines , which in turn , produced a more robust ( smaller standard deviation ) stellar velocity dispersion . because the data quality was so good for ddo 168",
    ", the sky subtraction issues did nt cause much variance in the resulting velocity dispersions .",
    "however , because of the poor weather conditions and troubles with sky subtraction , there was only one extracted spectrum from ddo 46 that produced a cross - correlation peak above 3@xmath56 .",
    "table [ tab:3 ] shows the dates that the standard stars were observed and all stars observed on the same night make up the number of stars used in the ccm .",
    "for example , to obtain the stellar kinematics for the morphological major axis of ddo 168 observed on 18 april 2009 , we used the following seven stellar templates also observed on 18 april 2009 in the ccm : hd 66141 , hd 92588 , hd 132737 , hd 145001 , hd 182572 , hd 187691 , and the sun .",
    "we derive the heliocentric radial velocities of the stars in each object using the peaks of the ccm .",
    "for each night , we cross - correlate the standard star templates with themselves in order to check the radial velocities and also to model the instrumental fwhm ( @xmath60 ) of the cross - correlation peak . on average",
    ", we found that the @xmath60 @xmath4 30 .",
    "we subtracted the @xmath60 in quadrature from the fwhm of the individual galaxy spectra cross - correlated with the template stars ( @xmath61 ) in order to determine the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the galaxies . in equation [ eqn : sigma ]",
    ", we use the definition of a gaussian to derive the _ observed _ stellar velocity dispersions of the stars : @xmath62 figure [ fig:3 ] shows example cross - correlation peaks for the cross - correlation between the summed regions of each galaxy and a single radial velocity standard star .",
    "the s / n ratio for the cross - correlation peak is above 3 for each spectrum and because of the low s / n in the peak of ddo 46 , the profile has a bumpy appearance .",
    "we observed as many different spectral types and classes ( and metallicities , when available ) of radial velocity standard stars each night ( of which there are nt that many to choose from in a given night ) in order to create as diverse a stellar template library as possible .",
    "the spectrum of hd 132737 in figure [ fig:2 ] is representative of how the stellar template spectra have deeper , more well defined absorption features than the galaxy spectra .",
    "it is difficult to measure the effect of this template mismatch on the velocity dispersion results .",
    "however , the fwhm values determined from the ccm for ddo 46 and ddo 168 are all remarkably consistent for a given galaxy spectrum and do not vary by more than 10% between the template@xmath12galaxy pairs .",
    "also , we found that there is less than a 10% difference between the fwhm values from the cross - correlations between the different pairs of template stars , which is the same as for the template@xmath12galaxy pairs .",
    "we noticed that the solar spectrum has consistently higher fwhm values when cross - correlated with the other templates ( although only slightly and all within 10% of the other templates ) and this is likely attributed to the sun s higher log(g ) value compared to the giant template stars .",
    "we determined the errors on the instrumental dispersion by determining the standard deviation of the fwhm values from fxcor for each template star using the mean of the template@xmath12template pairs for each template and then , using the standard deviations as weights , we calculated the weighted average of all the templates from a given night to derive the final instrumental fwhm .",
    "thus , our errors are reflective of any systematic effects .",
    "the results of the ccm provide the @xmath63 stellar velocity dispersions along the line of sight . in order to determine",
    "if ddo 46 and ddo 168 are disks or triaxial in nature , we require the central velocity dispersion perpendicular to the disk , @xmath0 , in order to derive /@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we need to decompose @xmath64 into its three velocity components , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "we begin our analysis by assuming that the stars in both systems follow the trends observed in spiral galaxies and have constant scale heights @xcite , constant mass - to - light @xmath68 ratios @xcite , and are in isothermal rotating disks , the last of which is a fair assumption given that the gas disks are rotating and the stars appear to be following this rotation as shown in figures [ fig:4 ] and [ fig:5 ] . from these assumptions , we apply the following equation from @xcite : @xmath69 sin^2i + \\sigma_{\\rm z}^2\\ cos^2i\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the observed position angle within the plane of the galaxy , @xmath71 is the receding kinematic major axis pa and @xmath52 is the inclination of disk .",
    "following the reasoning of @xcite and @xcite , we use the approximation from the milky way and other spiral galaxies that show that @xmath66/@xmath65 @xmath4 0.7 ( * ? ? ?",

    "these ratios , @xmath66/@xmath65 and @xmath67/@xmath65 , appear to be constant with radius in spiral galaxies @xcite and putting these relationships together gives @xmath73 .",
    "if we take this reasoning at face value , then along the kinematic major axis position angle ( @xmath74 = 0 ) , the dependence on inclination drops out , so equation [ eqn : disp ] reduces to @xmath64 = @xmath66 .",
    "how valid the above assumptions and @xmath66/@xmath65 and @xmath67/@xmath65 relationships are to ddo 46 and ddo 168 is unclear .",
    "one thing we do know , however , is that in the region where we measure the stellar velocity dispersions , the rotation curves in ddo 46 and ddo 168 are rising in a solid body manner and thus , the ratio @xmath75 rather than 0.7 .",

    "for ddo 46 , we suffered rainy , cloudy weather and therefore , we were only able to extract one central data point from the morphological major axis .",
    "the velocity of this single point , 377 @xmath2 12 , matches the  gas velocity at the same location in the disk as shown in the position - velocity diagram in figure [ fig:4 ] .",
    "the resulting stellar velocity dispersion of this point is 15 @xmath2 9  and if we use the  inclination determined from the tilted - ring model of @xmath77 and apply equation [ eq : disper ] , we obtain  = 13.5 @xmath2 8 .",
    "[ subfig:4 ]    for ddo 168 , the velocities of the stars match the  velocities as seen in the p - v diagrams in figure [ fig:5 ] .",
    "however , the morphological major axis ( pa = 153@xmath48 ) is not aligned with the kinematic major axis .",
    "there are three pieces of evidence for this misalignment : 1 ) there is rotation in the stars and gas along the morphological minor axis , 2 ) there is a lack of rotation in both the stars and gas in pa = 198@xmath48 and , 3 ) there is strong rotation in the  along intermediate pa = 108@xmath48 .",
    "the  kinematic analysis performed using the tilted - ring model and described in section [ sec : hirot ] , shows that ddo 168 has a kinematic major axis for the gas of 96@xmath78 measured east from north in the plane of the sky ( as compared to 276@xmath78 quoted in table [ tab:1 ] , which is @xmath79 from this value because the `` kinematic major axis '' is generally defined as the direction of the receding side of the galaxy ) .    for ddo 168",

    "<S> determining the shape of dwarf irregular ( dirr ) galaxies is controversial because if one assumes that these objects are disks and if these disks are randomly distributed over the sky , then their projected minor - to - major axis ratios should follow a particular statistical distribution , which is not observed . </S>",
    "<S> thus , different studies have led to different conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> some believe that the observed distributions can be explained by assuming the dirrs are _ thick _ disks while others have concluded that dirrs are triaxial . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , the central stellar velocity dispersion , @xmath0 , combined with maximum rotation speed , , provides a kinematic measure , /@xmath0 , which gives the three dimensional shape of a system . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we present the stellar and gas kinematics of ddo 46 and ddo 168 from the little things survey and determine their respective /@xmath0 values . </S>",
    "<S> we used the kitt peak national observatory s mayall 4-meter telescope with the echelle spectrograph as a long - slit spectrograph , which provided a two dimensional , 3@xmath1-long slit . </S>",
    "<S> we acquired spectra of ddo 168 along four position angles by placing the slit over the morphological major and minor axes and two intermediate position angles . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to poor weather conditions during our observing run for ddo 46 , we were able to extract only one useful data point from the morphological major axis . </S>",
    "<S> we determined a central stellar velocity dispersion perpendicular to the disk , @xmath0 , of 13.5 @xmath2 8  for ddo 46 and < @xmath0 > of 10.7 @xmath2 2.9  for ddo 168 . </S>",
    "<S> we then derived the maximum rotation speed in both galaxies using the little things  data . </S>",
    "<S> we separated bulk motions from non - circular motions using a double gaussian decomposition technique and applied a tilted - ring model to the bulk velocity field . </S>",
    "<S> we corrected the observed  rotation speeds for asymmetric drift and found a maximum velocity , , of 77.4 @xmath2 3.7 and 67.4 @xmath2 4.0 for ddo 46 and ddo 168 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we derived a kinematic measure , /@xmath0 , of 5.7 @xmath2 0.6 for ddo 46 and 6.3 @xmath2 0.3 for ddo 168 . comparing these values to ones determined for spiral galaxies , </S>",
    "<S> we find that ddo 46 and ddo 168 have /@xmath0 values indicative of _ thin _ disks , which is in contrast to minor - to - major axis ratio studies . </S>"
