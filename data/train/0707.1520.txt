    "@xmath13 viscosity relates the rate of momentum transfer to the velocity gradient . for dilute gases the microscopic mechanism for momentum transfer",
    "is provided by atomic collisions .",
    "this mechanism becomes more efficient as the mean free path gets larger because in that case the atoms travel larger distances between collisions and transfer momenta between laminar layers of more disparate flow velocities .",

    "this leads to the question of whether there is a fundamental limit to how small the viscosity can get as the strength of the interaction is increased .",
    "stated differently , we would like to determine the shear viscosity of the most `` perfect '' fluid .",
    "there is an old argument that suggests that quantum mechanics places a lower limit on the shear viscosity  @xcite . a rough estimate of the viscosity is provided by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the number density , @xmath17 is the average momentum , and @xmath18 the mean free - path .",

    "this result can be combined with high temperature calculations of the shear viscosity to provide an estimate of the location and magnitude of the viscosity minimum .",
    "we find that the minimum value of @xmath21 occurs close to @xmath4 , and that the value of @xmath21 is likely to exceed the proposed viscosity bound .",
    "a similar viscosity minimum is expected to occur in qcd . at low temperature",
    "the viscosity is dominated by weakly interacting nambu - goldstone bosons ( pions and kaons ) @xcite , and at high temperature the viscosity is governed by weakly interacting quarks and gluons @xcite .",
    "there are a number of issues that deserve further study .",
    "the viscosity of the superfluid unitarity gas has the same @xmath222 behavior as the viscosity of liquid helium at low temperature . in the case of liquid helium",
    "the viscosity is believed to be dominated by @xmath69 processes . on - shell",
    "phonon splitting processes can only occur if higher order corrections to the effective lagrangian lead to a concave phonon dispersion relation [ @xmath223 ) with @xmath224 .",
    "for the unitarity fermi gas we do not know whether this is the case .",
    "it is known that the bogoliubov spectrum of a weakly interacting bose gas has @xmath225 , so the role of these processes can be studied in an expansion around the bose - einstein limit .",
    "in general we would like to extend the calculation to higher temperatures . in the vicinity of the @xmath4",
    "we expect both bosonic and fermionic excitations to play a role . a possible starting point in this regime",
    "is provided by the expansion around @xmath226 spatial dimensions proposed in @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to improve the high temperature calculations by including correlations between the fermions .",
    "some steps in this direction were taken in @xcite .",
    "the authors acknowledge helpful discussions with dean lee . this work was supported in parts by the us department of energy grant de - fg02 - 03er41260 .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath227 arises from the pole terms in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "we find ( see @xcite ) @xmath228\\delta(p_0-s_1 e_k - s_2   e_{\\bm{p - k}}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath229 ^ 2\\big|_{k_0=s   e_k}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there are four terms , corresponding to @xmath230 .",
