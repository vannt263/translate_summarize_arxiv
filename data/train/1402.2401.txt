    "soft hadronic matter production in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions is most successfully described within the framework of relativistic viscous hydrodynamics @xcite .",

    "our present calculation indicates that such an assumption must be relaxed and , probably , higher moments of the kinetic equation should be used to derive extra equations that allow for the determination of the independent evolution of these two scales .    finally , in fig .",

    "the results of the kinetic equations have been compared to the predictions of the anisotropic hydrodynamics describing a mixture of anisotropic fluids .",
    "we have found that the solutions of the kinetic equations can be well reproduced by anisotropic hydrodynamics in the case where the initial distribution are oblate for both quarks and gluons .",
    "especially , the good agreement is found if one looks at the global characteristics of the system such as the total energy density or total longitudinal and transverse pressures .",

    "the solutions of anisotropic hydrodynamics exhibit exponential behavior which is absent in the solutions of the kinetic equations .",
