    "vast amounts of multi - frequency radio data at long wavelengths will soon begin to flow from next generation radio instruments such as the low frequency array ( lofar ) and eventually the square kilometre array ( ska ) . with this",
    ", opportunities will arise for studying some of the earliest radio sources in the universe , their environments and their evolution over cosmic time .",
    "there is also the tantalizing possibility of studying conditions within the epoch of reionisation itself through high - z radio sources : if sufficiently bright radio sources can be found at redshifts greater than 6.5 , it should be possible to measure absorption signatures of neutral hydrogen , and hence trace changes in the ionisation state of the universe with cosmic time ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of a correlation between redshift and observed spectral index @xmath0 ] for powerful radio sources was first suggested by @xcite who found that the introduction of a steep spectral index cut led to an increasing fraction of sources without optical counterparts identified on poss-_i _ ( _ r _ @xmath4 20 ) plates .",
    "@xcite used the combination of complete samples from the 3crr @xcite , 6ce @xcite and 7crs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) surveys to confirm that the high frequency ( 5 ghz ) rest - frame spectral index correlates with redshift , but showed that this correlation is weaker for spectral index measured at lower rest - frame frequencies .",
    "since then , there have been many surveys designed to pick out only ultra steep spectrum ( uss ) sources for further infra - red imaging and spectroscopic follow - up ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , having varying degrees of success selecting high - z sources .",
    "many of these have additional selection criteria such as small angular size and faint infrared magnitude applied after the uss cut , which makes it difficult to determine the extent to which the uss cut is responsible for selecting high - z sources .",
    "@xcite present a sample of uss selected galaxies selected from the sydney university molonglo sky survey ( sumss ) , and discuss the apparent mechanisms for the z-@xmath0 correlation in detail .",
    "they dismiss the possibility of k - corrections being the cause of the observed steepening radio spectra , given that the majority of their radio spectra show no evidence for curvature .",
    "they suggest that enhanced spectral aging due to inverse compton losses against the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) at high redshift is the most likely origin for the observed z-@xmath0 correlation , or that it may arise due to an intrinsic relation between low frequency @xmath0 and radio luminosity coupled to a malmquist bias . following on from this work ,",
    "@xcite compare the median redshift of several complete samples with the median redshift obtained from uss selected samples .",
    "they find it to be lower in complete samples , and argue that this is strong evidence for the efficiency of the uss technique .",
    "however whilst uss samples clearly do select higher redshift sources , sample comparisons between uss and complete samples are not ideal for either optimising or quantifying the efficiency of the technique",
    ". the most rigorous approach would be to apply selection criterion to complete samples with significant numbers of sources at the highest redshifts currently known , and quantify the number of high redshift sources included / missed .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     this d - z relation has implications for the z-@xmath0 correlation , in that as we move out to higher and higher redshifts , we will eventually reach a regime where radio sources are mostly @xmath1host galaxy sizes .",
    "the association of a significant fraction of infrared faint radio sources ( which are radio sources without an optical or infrared identification , and hence potentially high redshift candidates , but often not with an ultra - steep spectrum ; e.g. @xcite ) , as css sources @xcite offers further support for this .",
    "some css sources are very luminous , and can display observed spectral indexes of a steepness comparable to ultra steep spectrum sources ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which would be expected as the source is expanding through the dense medium of its host . if sources are still propagating through the host galaxies , as opposed to the igm , this may change the nature of the z-@xmath0 correlation at high redshifts , as css / gps sources have a self - absorbed ( peaked ) radio spectrum .",
    "such sources may be selected on an uss spectral index in the ghz regime , but not at lower frequencies .",
    "table [ tab7 ] , and figure [ fig9 ] both suggest that the fraction of young css sources gets higher at high redshifts .",
    "radio - based techniques could be expanded to compare candidate source sizes with the location of the spectral peak ( e.g. @xcite ) , as well as the radio spectral shape . especially in combination with existing and up - coming deep , widefield optical and near - infrared data , next generation instruments such as lofar and the ska will provide the crucial high resolution and sensitivity across a wide spectral range necessary to do this , and in conjunction with upcoming high frequency wide area surveys such as wodan @xcite , will enable very good high redshift radio source candidates to be successfully located .",

    "<S> the existence of a correlation between observed radio spectral index and redshift has long been used as a method for selecting high redshift radio galaxy candidates . </S>",
    "<S> we use 9 highly spectroscopically complete radio samples , selected at different frequencies and flux limits , to determine the efficiency of this method , and compare consistently observed correlations between spectral index ( @xmath0 ) , luminosity ( p ) , linear size ( d ) and redshift ( z ) in our samples . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a weak correlation between z and @xmath0 which remains even when malmquist bias is removed . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the z-@xmath0 correlation is dependent on both the k - correction and sample selection frequency , in addition to the frequency at which @xmath0 is measured , and consistent results for both high and low frequency selected samples are only seen if analysis is restricted to just extended radio galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this fits with the popular interpretation that the spectra steepen with z because the radio lobes work against a denser igm environment as z increases , out to z@xmath12 - 3 . </S>",
    "<S> however we also note that the majority of sources known at z@xmath24 are very compact and often display a negatively curved or peaked spectrum , indicative of youth or merger activity , and therefore the low frequency radio spectrum as a whole should be determined ; this is something for which the new low frequency array will be crucial . </S>",
    "<S> we quantify both the efficiency and the completeness of various techniques used to select high - z radio candidates . </S>",
    "<S> a steep - spectrum cut applied to low - frequency selected samples can more than double the fraction of high - z sources , but at a cost of excluding over half of the high - z sources present in the original sample . </S>",
    "<S> an angular size cut is an almost as equally effective radio - based method as a steep - spectrum cut for maximising the high - z content of large radio samples , and works for both high and low frequency selected samples . in multi - wavelength data , </S>",
    "<S> selection first of infrared - faint radio sources remains by far the most efficient method of selecting high - z sources . </S>",
    "<S> we present a simple method for selecting high - z radio sources , based purely on combining their observed radio properties of @xmath0 and angular size , with the addition of the _ k_-band magnitude if available .    </S>",
