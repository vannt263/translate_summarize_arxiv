    "we use the tabulated values of the observed rest - frame @xmath60 band surface brightnesses from @xcite along with the half - light radii in that paper . to convert the @xmath60 band surface brightness into a @xmath4 band surface brightness",

    "the apertures used to define these colors are the half - light radii measured by fitting a de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "in addition , the authors fit srsic models .",
    "there is a difference in their srsic models , however , when compared to the srsic models in this paper . in @xcite",
    "the authors allowed the srsic parameter to the range @xmath61 .",
    "we restricted @xmath62 over a smaller range , @xmath48 for our fits of rdcs j1252.9 - 2927  and rx j0152.7 - 1357 .",
    "so , in all cases where @xcite finds @xmath63 , we replace the results of that fit , namely @xmath18 and @xmath19 , with corresponding @xmath64 results from @xcite .",
    "in order to measure the evolution in the kormendy relation @xcite , we need robust measures of the half - light radius and surface brightness .",
    "below we discuss two methods , one parametric and one non - parametric , we used to measure both the total magnitudes , from which we infer the surface brightness , and the half - light radii .      to determine the colors of each of the galaxies , we used models to establish the appropriate size of the apertures .",
    "we fit a single srsic profile and allowed the parameter @xmath62 to vary over the range @xmath48 .",
    "we imposed this restriction because we found that , if we did not , a few objects would settle to very high @xmath62 numbers and , correspondingly large half - light radii .",
    "as the goal for the fits was to provide radii for measuring the colors of the red - sequence galaxies , large radii potentially could lead to systematic errors in the measurements .",
    "the models were fitted using galfit @xcite , and yield the half - light radius and total magnitude of the model .",
    "the mean interior surface brightness within the half - light radius for that model can then be computed as @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "the galfit output for the size is actually the semi - major axis of the best fitting elliptical model .",
    "we convert this radius into the effective radius , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the semi - major and semi - minor axes respectively , when we discuss the half - light radius .",
    "as mentioned above , the fitting procedure constructs a model , convolves it with the point spread function , and then compares the resulting @xmath27 between the model and the data . because the modeling process explicitly includes",
    "the point spread function , even for objects with sizes smaller than the point spread function , a full width at half maximum of @xmath69 009 , could be , in principle , reliably measured .",
    "however , errors in our point spread functions could cause systematic biases in our resulting half - light radii .",
    "thus , we will exclude from our analysis objects with model half - light radii less than 01 for the rest of the paper .",
    "one of the advantages of the galfit software is the ability to fit multiple component models to multiple galaxies simultaneously . for most of the galaxies ,",
    "however , we masked out neighboring objects using the results of the sextractor segmentation map , _",
    "i.  e. _ , the map of pixels above the isophotal detection threshold . at minimum ,",
    "each postage stamp was 50 by 50 pixels .",
    "the actual size was four times the square root of sextractor s isophotal area , the number of pixels one @xmath70 above the sky . for close galaxies , however , we had to fit models simultaneously .",
    "this was often the case for the luminous ellipticals in the cores of the clusters . in cases",
    "where a multiple galaxies had to be fit , we ensured that all of the pixels that would be in the individual stamps using the above recipe were included in the stamp containing multiple galaxies .",
    "for every object in the color - selected and spectroscopic redshift sample of rdcs j1252.9 - 2927  and spectroscopic redshift sample of rx j0152.7 - 1357 we fit a pure de vaucouleurs , or @xmath64 srsic profile , in addition to the already existing srsic model .",
    "we selected a fixed @xmath62 model , in addition to the srsic fits , for two reasons .",
    "first , the models have one less degree of freedom and therefore the potential to be more robust .",
    "second , a de vaucouleurs model has traditionally been used .",
    "thus , we can compare with a broader range of results from the literature .",
    "we plot in figures [ clsizemag ] and [ cltsizemag ] the observed size - surface brightness relation using the results from pure de vaucouleurs model fits .",
    "the relation appears linear but with a large scatter for rdcs j1252.9 - 2927 .",
    "this scatter likely comes from a combination of observational errors , the inclusion of non - cluster members and systematic biases in addition to the intrinsic scatter in the relation .",
    "the size - surface brightness relation for rx j0152.7 - 1357  is much tighter .",
    "the biweight scale @xcite of the scatter around the mean relation for rx j0152.7 - 1357  is @xmath71 for the de vaucouleurs models and @xmath72 for the srsic models as opposed to @xmath73 for the de vaucouleurs and @xmath74 for the srsic models for rdcs j1252.9 - 2927 .",

    "galfit reports the errors on the individual terms but it is well known that there are significant anti - correlations between the errors for the surface brightness and size @xcite .",
    "fortunately , these errors are almost parallel with the actual size - surface brightness relation , so objects will be scattered along the relation . we illustrate the expected anti - correlation in figures [ clsizemag ] and [ cltsizemag ] .",

    "we assume that this is a point spread function effect , as discussed above , and will not use galaxies with sizes @xmath7501 for our analysis .",
    "the main problem with both of our current measurements of the size and total magnitude is that they depend on fitting models to the data . to complement these model magnitudes",
    ", we implemented the approach of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this approach uses the petrosian @xmath77 measure @xcite to derive a model independent aperture .",
    "to review , the petrosian @xmath78 computes the ratio of the surface brightness , @xmath79 at a particular radius , @xmath80 to the average surface brightness within that radius @xmath81 .",
    "this is the inverse of the function originally developed by petrosian , but this version produces more tractable errors . given @xmath77 for our galaxies , we need to decide on how to use it to derive an aperture . in the literature",
    "there are two choices . @xcite and",
    "@xcite selected the aperture at which @xmath82 to measure the magnitude .",
    "this aperture contains 95% of the total light of an exponential disk and 87% of the light of a de vaucouleurs profile @xcite .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss * ? ? ?",
    "* ) use petrosian derived apertures as well , specifically the aperture containing twice the diameter at which @xmath83 .",
    "this aperture contains 99% of the total light of an exponential disk but only 82% of the light of a de vaucouleurs profile @xcite .",
    "given that early - type galaxies are dominated by de vaucouleurs profiles , we select the approach of @xcite instead of the approach of the sdss outlined in @xcite .    when computing the @xmath77 distribution , we do not fit elliptical isophotes , as did @xcite , but use circular apertures as is done in the sdss @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that circular apertures , when plotted against effective radii , reproduce the results of fitting elliptical isophotes . to compensate for the lower signal - to - noise at larger radii , instead of using the adaptive bin size approach of @xcite",
    ", we choose to bin logarithmically in radius . finally , to determine at what radius @xmath82",
    ", we interpolate our @xmath77 distributions for each object using a low order polynomial .",
    "this still leaves the question of correcting the aperture magnitude to a total magnitude . for each object",
    ", we measure the aperture where @xmath77 crosses 0.1 and then use that size to measure a total magnitude .",
    "this @xmath84 magnitude is computed by interpolating from the curve of growth of the galaxy .",
    "this magnitude is not , however , the total magnitude of the galaxy . as we do not want to use a model - dependent aperture correction , we add 0.1 mag to this magnitude .",
    "this would yield a magnitude 5% larger than the true total magnitude for an exponential disk and 3% less than the true total magnitude of a de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "as most of our galaxies have srsic values of @xmath85 , this aperture correction should , in principle , yield around 97% to 99% of the total light for the galaxies . for the rest of this paper",
    ", we will refer to this as our petrosian total magnitude .",
    "with two different models used for fitting and an additional non - parametric total magnitude for each galaxy in each cluster , we can independently estimate the sizes of the errors on the sizes and total magnitudes .",
    "the statistical errors based on the expected variance in the photon flux for these galaxies are tiny , on the order of a hundredth of a mag .",
    "however , this ignores the errors caused by how well the model describes the data or the size of aperture .",
    "the formal errors in the fits are also small , with a @xmath86 per degree of freedom around @xmath87 for the residuals .",
    "however , it is straightforward to construct models that fits a given distribution well , in the sense that the models yield a small @xmath86 per degree of freedom , but actually deviates systematically from the model . a good illustration of this are galaxies which are well fit by @xmath64 models but , when fit with a srsic , yield a value of @xmath62 far from 4 .",
    "our non - parametric measure of the total magnitude checks for this .     for details .",

    "we observe , using the size - surface brightness relation , @xmath163 @xmath4 mag of luminosity evolution from @xmath6 to @xmath0 . if we restrict our highest redshift sample to only those galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts , instead of the large sample of galaxies with red colors , we find @xmath143 mag of evolution , which is in statistical agreement with our other result . if we use only the color selection for rdcs j1252.9 - 2927 , we find that both of the measurements agree well with the fp results at the same redshifts @xcite and , thus , with the overall trend in luminosity evolution found from other size - surface brightness studies @xcite .",
    "the overall agreement points towards the conclusion that the majority of massive elliptical galaxies at these redshifts are passively evolving , in agreement with their color evolution .    given that we find slow luminosity evolution for the majority of cluster early - type galaxies in our samples , this is another indication that the luminosity - weighted redshift of formation is high for these objects .",
    "@xcite finds @xmath164 , though for a different cosmology , using the fp , while @xcite finds @xmath165 for certain assumptions about early - type galaxy evolution . as the evolution found in that paper",
    "agrees with the evolution in offset of the size - surface brightness relation , we would find a similar result .",
    "this epoch of formation is also in agreement with @xcite from the colors of galaxies in rdcs j1252.9 - 2927 . in general , the large scatter on the size - surface brightness relation prevents us from making significantly more accurate measurements of @xmath166 .",
    "since we selected galaxies for red colors in rdcs j1252.9 - 2927 , we could very well be missing an important part of the cluster early - type population , namely those galaxies that will become red early - types but are bluer than our selection criteria at the epoch of the observations .",
    "this would bias our results to higher redshifts .",
    "the redshift selected sample of rdcs j1252.9 - 2927 , however , shows much more evolution , @xmath143 mag as compared with the color - selected sample .",
    "it is possible that this is a selection effect .",
    "namely , it is easier to measure redshifts for higher surface brightnesses objects .",
    "we attempted to mitigate this by trimming the redshift - selected sample at @xmath29 , where the redshift - selected sample is almost complete , containing 17 out of 20 early - type galaxies with @xmath167015 , regardless of color .",
    "one possible explanation for this result is the scatter around the mean size - surface brightness relation .",
    "we observe that the apparent scatter for rdcs j1252.9 - 2927  around the size - surface brightness relation is larger than for rx j0152.7 - 1357 .",
    "this result is not statistically siginificant though an increase in the scatter would be expected at higher redshifts .",
    "there are a couple of lines of evidence that , at @xmath168 , there are elliptical galaxies that show evidence of recent star formation",
    ". such objects would show a smaller than average @xmath169 .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite find galaxies morphologically classified as early - type galaxies but with strong balmer absorption lines indicating recent starbursts .",
    "the example galaxy in the fundamental plane sample of @xcite has a much lower than expected @xmath169 value , a factor of @xmath6913 lower than the massive galaxies in that sample , and @xcite finds a large scatter in the @xmath169 value for a purely luminosity selected sample , much larger than the scatter for lower redshift clusters such as coma or ms 1358 + 62 .",
    "the inclusion of a handful of such galaxies in our sample would increase the scatter but disentangling them requires spectra or good information .",
    "spectroscopic evidence for recent bursts of star - formation in rdcs j1252.9 - 2927 , which could explain both the larger scatter and the larger apparent evolution when using only the spectroscopically - selected sample , will be discussed in a future paper @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the size - surface brightness relation for two clusters of galaxies , rdcs j1252.9 - 2927  at @xmath0 and rx j0152.7 - 1357  at @xmath1 . for each cluster",
    ", we identified , by eye , a sample of early - type galaxies across a broad range in color and in magnitude @xcite . using our acs imaging , which covers the rest - frame @xmath4",
    ", we created a magnitude limited sample for each cluster .",
    "the magnitude limits correspond to approximately @xmath170 for rdcs j1252.9 - 2927  and @xmath171 for rx j0152.7 - 1357 . for rx j0152.7 - 1357 , we selected galaxies based on the 102 spectroscopic redshifts @xcite .",
    "rdcs j1252.9 - 2927  has 36 spectroscopic members @xcite and we expanded the sample for that cluster using a color selection .",
    "our color criteria for rdcs j1252.9 - 2927  utilizes the color - magnitude relation and scatter from @xcite , including all galaxies within two standard deviations of the mean relation . in each case , we chose the observed magnitude limit in the filter that corresponds most closely to the rest - frame @xmath4 band .",
    "we fit both srsic and de vaucouleurs models to each galaxy in our two cluster samples .",
    "these models provide total magnitudes and half - light radii with the point spread function broadening removed .",
    "we converted the total magnitudes to the average surface brightness within the half - light radius .",
    "in addition to the model total magnitudes , we implemented a third total magnitude measurement .",
    "we used the petrosian magnitudes as implemented in @xcite and found excellent agreement between these non - parametric measurements and the srsic model magnitudes .",
    "the disagreement with the de vaucouleurs models in general involved a small systematic of @xmath172 mag depending on the cluster . in addition",
    ", we found that the difference between the de vaucouleurs model magnitudes and either the srsic or petrosian magnitudes correlated with the model sizes for one of the two clusters . in general , we find that our overall trends are robust , regardless of which size and magnitude we used for determining the surface brightness as long as we compare a given cluster measurement with a measurement made using the same model in a different cluster .",
    "we measured the amount of rest - frame @xmath4 magnitude evolution by computing the shift in apparent surface brightness at a fixed size .",
    "we compare the clusters in this paper to the results from ms 1358 + 62  in @xcite , which contains both srsic and de vaucouleurs average surface brightnesses and half - light radii . for ms 1358 + 62 ,",
    "we compute the amount of evolution required to match the size - surface brightness relation between ms 1358 + 62  and either rdcs j1252.9 - 2927  or rx j0152.7 - 1357 , with the data trimmed at a fixed size and magnitude limit .",
    "we apply this correction to the data in ms 1358 + 62 , recompute which galaxies would fall above our magnitude limit , and repeat until we converge .",
    "we also apply this to ms 1358 + 62  and the @xmath4 band coma cluster data of @xcite . for that",
    ", we measure @xmath173 mag of evolution , in excellent agreement with the fundamental plane , or fp , measurements @xcite .",
    "the rest of the evolution measurements , summarized in table [ tevol ] , show results consistent with the fp in most cases .",
    "we find that the average surface brightness at a fixed sized changes with redshift as @xmath174 , very close to the @xmath175 found with the fp .",
    "only when we examine the subset of galaxies in rdcs j1252.9 - 2927  selected by spectroscopic membership do we find a deviation .",
    "the overall trend in the luminosity evolution that we find agrees with this . at the redshift of rdcs j1252.9 - 2927 , we are likely within a @xmath176 gyrs of observing epoch when most of the stars formed in cluster early - type galaxies .",
