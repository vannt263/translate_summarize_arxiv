    "in this letter we present a description of the form factors @xmath16 and @xmath9 describing semileptonic @xmath2 decays , where @xmath4 denotes a @xmath6 or @xmath5 meson . for the @xmath5 meson",

    "ultimately , experimental measurements of @xmath18 for given momentum - transfer @xmath19 will be compared directly to theoretical determinations at the same @xmath0 values to determine @xmath20 . in the interim",
    ", it may be helpful to consider the decay rate integrated partially or completely over @xmath0 , but this requires knowledge of the @xmath0 dependence of the form factors .",
    "lattice calculations and sumrule calculations apply in ( different ) restricted ranges of @xmath0 while dispersion relations may be used to bound the form factors over the whole @xmath0 range  @xcite , or as a basis for models  @xcite .",
    "a variety of models exists for the whole range of @xmath0 .",
    "one can ensure that general kinematic relations and the demands of heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) are satisfied , but an ansatz , such as pole , dipole or other forms , is still required  @xcite",
    ".    here we use the omns representation to obtain the full @xmath0 dependence of these form factors from the elastic @xmath21 scattering amplitudes . for our application",
    "we have an isospin-@xmath22 channel , with angular momentum @xmath23 or @xmath24 for @xmath16 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "we rely on the following description of the ( inverse ) amplitude for elastic @xmath21 scattering in the isospin  @xmath25 , angular momentum  @xmath26 , channel , with centre - of - mass squared - energy @xmath27 and masses @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively  @xcite , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the two - particle irreducible scattering amplitude and @xmath32 is a constant .",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath31 are real in the scattering region .",
    "this description implements elastic unitarity automatically .",

    ", @xmath38 can be used in an omns representation  @xcite giving @xmath39 in terms of an integral involving the phase shift , assuming that at threshold the phase shift should be @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the number of bound states in the particular channel considered , and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the number of zeros of the scattering amplitude on the physical sheet ( this is levinson s theorem  @xcite ) .",
    "we determine @xmath31 from tree level heavy meson chiral perturbation theory ( hmchpt ) @xcite , which implements hqs and is a double expansion in powers of @xmath44 and momenta , where @xmath29 is the heavy meson mass .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 in equation  ( [ eq : tinv ] ) partially accounts for higher order contributions in the expansion  @xcite .",
    "we find consistency of our description with lattice results for the @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath45 @xcite form factors if we set the hmchpt coupling , @xmath7 , to values smaller than @xmath8 .",
    "this upper bound is in reasonable agreement with other determinations , but @xmath7 is not very well known @xcite .",
    "our model and the omns representation are not guaranteed at high energies where inelasticities become important . however , our hypothesis is that only the low - lying states and energies should influence the form factors we consider .",
    "a dispersive approach to the @xmath16 form factor was taken by burdman and kambor  @xcite , who also used hmchpt to calculate the phase shift in @xmath46 scattering . here by working with the _ inverse _ amplitude",
    "we can ensure that watson s theorem and elastic unitarity are satisfied exactly .",
    "moreover , we compute @xmath16 and @xmath9 together to examine whether different behaviours in @xmath0 are found , consistent with lattice qcd results and allowing extra information from @xmath9 to be used to constrain @xmath16 .",

    "the @xmath70 resonance is only a few @xmath131 above threshold and the range of @xmath0 for the semileptonic decay is not large , so one expects a simple pole form for @xmath16 to work well . for @xmath5 physics ,",
    "the effects of higher resonances and continuum states are evidently more important : such effects are incorporated in lcsr calculations but are not present in the very simple model used here .",
    "we address this issue in section  [ sec : extrares ] below .",
    "heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) is an input in hmchpt .",
    "the hqs scaling relations for the @xmath5 decay form factors at @xmath105 are preserved because @xmath132 is proportional to @xmath133 the above result relies on the equality of the form factors at @xmath67 , @xmath68 . if @xmath134 , which we see is satisfied by our phase shifts at large @xmath135 , then the ratio @xmath136 as demanded by hqs , where @xmath29 and @xmath28 are the masses of the heavy meson and the pion respectively .",
    "we have applied the same approach to describe semileptonic @xmath137 decays . here , it gives form factors flatter than lattice results  @xcite and the experimental evidence  @xcite .",
    "however , corrections of both types @xmath138 and @xmath139 to the tree level hmchpt results used here are expected to be sizeable in this case .",
    "to    we noted above that our result for @xmath111 in equation  ( [ eq : res ] ) is higher than the lcsr value of around @xmath140 , while our fit for @xmath141 is well - approximated by a simple pole form with pole mass of order @xmath142 .",
    "this suggests that deviations from @xmath75 pole dominance can become significant at low @xmath0 .",
    "this phenomenon was also noted by burdman and kambor  @xcite who implemented a constrained dispersive model for @xmath122 .",
    "likewise , lattice results have favoured dipole forms in fits to @xmath122  @xcite .    to address this issue",
    "we have added a second resonance of mass @xmath143 by hand in the 2pi @xmath23 amplitude @xmath144 , coupling it like the @xmath51 but with its own coupling strength @xmath145 . in the @xmath6-meson case",
    ", we already had a good fit to the lattice results and a consistent value for @xmath112 .",
    "if @xmath143 is large enough the extra resonance does not disturb this picture . in the @xmath5 case , we can easily make @xmath111 smaller while still fitting lattice results at large @xmath0 . in figure",
    "[ fig : surface ] we show @xmath111 as a function of the couplings @xmath7 and @xmath145 for two choices of the extra resonance mass , @xmath146 .",
    "the problem in this case is that it is not possible to make a statistically acceptable fit to @xmath147 and @xmath148 simultaneously .",
    "one could try to add an extra resonance in the @xmath62 channel also , but while our choice of @xmath149 for @xmath23 may be motivated by potential models  @xcite or lattice results  @xcite , we do not know whether or how to set the mass for additional @xmath62 resonances , having already set the @xmath72 values to account for rather poorly known resonances .",
    "this emphasises the importance of looking at @xmath16 and @xmath9 together , even though @xmath16 is the experimentally accessible form factor .",
    "our model is extremely simple , using only tree level hmchpt information for the two particle irreducible amplitude @xmath31 , thereby incorporating only the first excited hadron state .",
    "furthermore we fix to a constant an allowed polynomial in @xmath0 muliplying the omns exponential factor in equation  ( [ eq : omnes ] ) .",
    "thus , deviations from lcsr results for @xmath16 are not unexpected because those calculations incorporate effects of higher resonances and continuum states . taking our model beyond leading order is not possible at present because of the proliferation of undetermined parameters which would appear in the next order of hmchpt and the lack of experimental data to fix them .",
    "this is a standard difficulty in using effective theories at higher orders .",
    "the simple model presented here gives an excellent description of semileptonic @xmath6-decays .",
    "for @xmath5-decays it gives a good description of the lattice data near @xmath105 and is also compatible within two standard deviations with lcsr predictions at @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , it provides a framework compatible with heavy quark symmetry , naturally accomodating pole - like behaviour for @xmath16 and , simultaneously , non - constant behaviour for @xmath9 .",
    "previously , as pointed out in  @xcite , a difficulty for form factor models with pole - type behaviour for @xmath16 was fixing a behaviour for @xmath9 which satisfied both the relation @xmath150 and the requirements of heavy quark symmetry .",
    "pole - like behaviour of @xmath16 turns out again to be feasible in our model , thanks to the fact that the @xmath75 is a bound state rather than a @xmath151 resonance .",
    "qualitatively , the results found here are encouraging .",
    "however , the larger value found for @xmath152 compared to that from lcsr calculations would lead to appreciably smaller values for @xmath20 .",
    "we caution the reader that this should not be taken to indicate a large theoretical spread in the value of @xmath20 from exclusive semileptonic @xmath10 decays : one should bear in mind the simplicity of the model used .",
    "we indicated how a second resonance in the @xmath23 channel can restore compatibility with both lcsr and lattice results for @xmath147 , although this shifts the problem to making @xmath148 compatible with the lattice data in a combined fit and emphasises the importance of using information from both form factors .",
