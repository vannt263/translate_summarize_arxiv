    "presymplectic structures ( constant rank , closed 2-forms ) arise naturally in the study of degenerate lagrangian and hamiltonian mechanical systems with constrains , in time dependent hamiltonian systems and in control theory .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    given a presymplectic form @xmath1 , a vector field @xmath2 is said to be a hamiltonian vector field associated with a function @xmath3 if : @xmath4 due to the degeneracy of @xmath5 , there can be different functions @xmath6 associated with @xmath7 , not differing by a constant .",
    "the corresponding flow @xmath8 is a 1-parameter group of presymplectic diffeomorphisms : @xmath9 .",
    "hence , the dynamics of such systems leave the presymplectic structure invariant . for other situations where presymplectic dynamics occur see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "our aim is to state and prove a kam type theorem for presymplectic dynamical systems , which extends the results of @xcite for the case of symplectic diffeomorphisms .",
    "our main result can be stated as follows .",
    "let @xmath10 be the @xmath11-dimensional torus .",
    "we consider the presymplectic manifold @xmath12    with an * exact * presymplectic form @xmath5 of rank @xmath13 , whose kernel coincides with the @xmath14-direction .",
    "see remark  [ presymplectic1 ] and remark  [ hypothesistransversal ] for more observations about the kernel .",
    "one says that @xmath15 is an invariant torus of a diffeomorphism @xmath16 with frequency @xmath17 if : @xmath18 when the left hand side is non - zero , but small enough ( in some smooth norm that will be made explicit later ) , one says that @xmath19 has an _ approximate _ invariant torus @xmath20 with frequency @xmath0 ( this will be made precise later ) .",
    "our main theorem can be stated in rough terms as follows :    let @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is as in , be an analytic , non - degenerate in the sense to be defined later , @xmath23-parametric family of presymplectic diffeomorphisms such that @xmath24 has an approximate invariant torus @xmath25 , satisfying a non - degeneracy condition , with frequency @xmath0 satisfying a diophantine condition . then there exists a diffeomorphism @xmath26 in this family , where @xmath27 is close to @xmath28 , which has an invariant torus @xmath29 with frequency @xmath0 and which is *  close \" * to the initial torus @xmath25 .",
    "the precise version of the theorem will be stated below in section [ sec : results ] . we need to formulate precisely the non - degeneracy conditions and to make more precise the definition of  close \" which requires introducing norms .",
    "note that we will not require the system to be neither nearly integrable , nor to be written in action - angle variables .",
    "indeed , just like in @xcite for the symplectic case , the fact that the dynamics of the system preserve the presymplectic structure implies that the kam tori are automatically approximately reducible .",
    "this leads to an approximate solution of the linearized equations without transformation theory .",
    "moreover , the reducing transformation is given explicitly in term of the approximately translated torus , which form the basis of an efficient numerical algorithm ( an explicit description of this algorithm can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "we will discuss all this in more detail in the section [ sec : results ] below .",
    "the proof of our main theorem follows an approach similar to the one developed in @xcite for the symplectic case .",
    "the presymplectic case however has a few peculiarities due to the degeneracy of the 2-form .",
    "for some of the most routine calculations , we will just refer to this paper .",
    "the quasi - newton method used here ( and in @xcite ) is of the type introduced by moser in @xcite .",
    "we note that the approach is not based on transformation theory , which seems problematic in the case of presymplectic mappings since generating functions are not as straightforward as in the symplectic case ( see @xcite for studies of the theory of canonical transformations ) and the lie transform method is hampered by the fact that there are several hamiltonians that give the same vector field .",
    "the approach is based on deriving a parameterization equation and applying corrections additively .",
    "the presymplectic geometry leads to cancellations that reduce a newton step to the constant coefficients cohomology equations customary in kam theory .",
    "we also note that the same cancellations lead to very effective numerical algorithms .",
    "we will also prove a flux - type vanishing lemma for exact presymplectic diffeomorphisms .",
    "roughly speaking , we will show that the average of the translation is zero in the directions other than the ones tangent to torus in the basis .",
    "note that in the directions tangent to torus the averaging does not need to vanish .",
    "this also shows the need for considering a parametric family of diffeomorphisms , rather than just a single diffeomorphism .",
    "there are two possible ways to extend the results , we have stated here for the maps , to flows .",
    "one is to use the local uniqueness we state in the theorem [ uniqtheo ] and the other one is to proceed with automatic reducibility for flows as in the symplectic case which is done in @xcite . both of them require some technical details and it is work in progress to do so .    as a final note",
    ", it should be remarked that the results of this paper are not applicable to the dynamics associated with general poisson structures . for regular poisson structures , which have an underlying regular symplectic foliation",
    ", there are cohomological obstructions to find a compatible presymplectic structure , see @xcite . even when these obstructions vanish ( e.g. , locally around invariant tori ) , so that one can find a compatible presymplectic structure , poisson diffeomorphisms do not coincide with presymplectic diffeomorphisms , and these two kinds of diffeomorphisms have quite distinct properties .",
    "the kam theory for poisson manifolds has been developed in @xcite . in section [ sec :",
    "comparison ] , we will compare the poisson and presymplectic cases .",
    "[ presymplectic1 ] an important well known fact about presymplectic forms @xmath5 is that the kernel of @xmath5 is an integrable distribution .",
    "we recall that the kernel of a form is @xmath30    note that , for a general @xmath31-form @xmath5 and any three vector fields @xmath32 , we have : @xmath33 z )   + \\omega ( [ x , z ] , y ] ) - \\omega (   [ y , z ] , x )   \\end{split}\\ ] ]    if @xmath34 and @xmath35 are in the kernel of @xmath5 , for any @xmath36 , we have @xmath37 , z ) = 0 $ ] .    hence , if @xmath38 , @xmath39 \\in { \\rm ker}(\\omega)$ ] .",
    "this shows that the distribution given by the kernel can be integrated to a manifold .    of course",
    ", in a torus , it could well happen that the leaves integrating the kernel are not compact ( e.g. they could be an irrational foliation ) .",
    "one example to keep in mind could be the three dimensional torus endowed with a presymplectic form @xmath40 .",
    "clearly , the kernel is given by the level sets of @xmath41 .",
    "a more complicated example on @xmath42 is @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a closed but not exact form . in this case",
    ", the kernel can be an irrational foliation .",
    "another example related to the previous ones is the study of quasi - periodically perturbed hamiltonian systems @xmath45 .",
    "these can be made autonomous by adding an extra variable @xmath46 that satisfies @xmath47 .",
    "the phase space is now supplemented by a factor @xmath48 .",
    "the symplectic form in the phase space becomes a presymplectic form in the extended phase space having @xmath48 in the kernel .",
    "even this elementary example was considered as covered by the kam theory of symplectic systems at the time of writing @xcite .",
    "the theory of presymplectic manifolds was developed ( e.g. in @xcite ) to give a geometric framework to the dirac theory of constrained systems , @xcite .",
    "there are many physically interesting examples of constrained systems to which the present theory applies .",
    "notably , besides the examples in @xcite , the papers @xcite contain a very concrete example of a relativistic system of spinning particles which is close to integrable .",
    "the paper @xcite shows how the pontriaguin maximum principle for optimal trajectories can be formulated using presymplectic systems .",
    "if we consider a mechanical system with kam tori and subject it to a control indexed by enough parameters , the results in this paper give a condition which ensures that the one adjust parameters to maintain the quasi - periodic motion .",
    "it would be interesting to study in detail concrete models , specially because the methods of this paper are well suited for numerical implementations .",
    "note that , in contrast with symplectic manifolds , presymplectic manifolds may be odd dimensional .",
    "hence , it is clear that an extension of the symplectic theory to presymplectic systems will require significant modifications .",
    "a general theory of perturbations of quasi - periodic motions independent of geometric structures was undertaken in @xcite .",
    "note , however that the perturbations by presymplectic systems do not satisfy the assumptions of @xcite because the normal eigenvalues of a torus do not change when we change the parameters .",
    "of course , in the presymplectic case the origin of this degeneracy is the preservation of the geometric structure , which also helps by eliminating some of the perturbing terms .",
    "this is the interpretation of the geometric identities used in this paper : they kill several dangerous perturbation terms .",
    "in this section we will fix some notations and state a few preliminary results . along the way",
    ", we will also justify the assumptions that will appear later in our main result .    as stated in the introduction",
    ", we consider @xmath49 equipped with a constant rank exact presymplectic structure , i.e. , an exact 2-form @xmath1 , such that its kernel is : @xmath50    the exactness assumption places restrictions on the presymplectic form but for applications to hamiltonian dynamical systems with constrains or degenerate lagrangian systems this is not too restrictive . for these systems the phase space is often obtained by restriction to a submanifold where the 2-form is the pullback of the canonical symplectic structure on the cotangent bundle ( see @xcite ) or some other exact symplectic form ( see @xcite ) .",

    "we will be looking for real analytic invariant tori which extend holomorphically to a small strip in the complex space .",

    "[ toriset ] the space @xmath73 consists of functions @xmath74 which are one periodic in all their arguments , real analytic on the interior of @xmath70 and continuous on the closure of @xmath70 .",

    "we will also use the same notations for functions taking values in vector spaces or in matrices .",
    "some well known results about the spaces above are the cauchy bounds below ( a consequence of cauchy s integral representation of the derivative ) . for @xmath76",

    "equation will be solved by newton method where at each step we have infinitesimal equations given by @xmath97 the approximate invariant tori and the geometry of the problem will lead us to a change of variables that will reduce to a simpler equation with constant coefficients that can be solved by the following result of rssmann which will also be useful in some other proofs .",

    ", very important , consequence of the diophantine condition on @xmath0 and the exactness of the presymplectic form is that invariant tori are actually lagrangian tori :    [ exactlag ] if @xmath109 is a solution of then @xmath110 is identically zero .    since @xmath111 satisfies and @xmath19 is presymplectic we have @xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath0 is rationally independent , rotations on the torus are ergodic and this implies that @xmath114 is constant .",
