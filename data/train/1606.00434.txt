    "the dust attenuation curve is a principal tool for inferring the absorption and scattering properties of interstellar dust grains , the spatial distribution of that dust relative to stars , and the intrinsic stellar populations of galaxies .",
    "observations of nearby galaxies have yielded detailed information on both the normalization and shape of the dust curve ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , our knowledge of the dust curve ( and how the curve varies ) at high redshift has only recently improved with large multi - wavelength and spectroscopic surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    despite these advances , the shape of the attenuation curve at far - ultraviolet ( far - uv ) wavelengths , in particular at @xmath12 ,",
    "is unconstrained at high redshift .",
    "establishing the shape of this curve at these wavelengths is imperative for several reasons .",
    "first , dust obscuration of starlight reaches its maximum in the far - uv , such that even small differences in the continuum color excess , @xmath4 , may lead to large variations in the inferred attenuation of far - uv light .",
    "hence , inferences of the intrinsic formation rate of the very massive stars that dominate the far - uv requires knowledge of the shape of the dust curve at these wavelengths .",
    "second , the translation between reddening and far - uv color depends on the shape of the far - uv attenuation curve .",
    "therefore , different shapes of the far - uv curve will result in different color criteria to select galaxies at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath13 ) where the ly@xmath14 forest is sufficiently thin and where the selection may include photometric bands that lie blueward of ly@xmath14 .",
    "stated another way , fixed far - uv color selection criteria will select galaxies at slightly different redshifts depending on the shape of the uv dust attenuation curve , and may affect the inferred selection volumes that are necessary for computing uv luminosity functions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "third , the utility of the ly@xmath14 emission line as a probe of the physical conditions ( e.g. , dust / gas distribution , gas kinematics ) in high - redshift galaxies requires some knowledge of dust grain properties and the distribution of the dust in the ism ( e.g. , @xcite ) , both of which are reflected in the shape of the attenuation curve .",
    "fourth , there has been renewed attention in the modeling of massive stars @xcite given evidence of rest - optical line ratios @xcite and uv spectral features of @xmath15 galaxies ( steidel et  al . , in prep ) that can not be modeled simultaneously with standard stellar population synthesis models .",
    "the modeling of the far - uv continuum of high - redshift galaxies is sensitive to the assumed dust attenuation curve .",
    "lastly , knowledge of the attenuation curve at or near the lyman break is needed to deduce the effect of dust obscuration on the depletion of hydrogen - ionizing photons , a potentially important ingredient in assessing the contribution of galaxies to reionization and translating recombination line luminosities to star - formation rates .    given the relevance of the far - uv shape of the dust attenuation curve , we sought to use the existing large spectroscopic samples of lyman break galaxies at @xmath1 to provide the first direct constraints on the shape of this curve at high redshift . in section",
    "[ sec : sample ] , we discuss the sample of galaxies and the procedure to construct far - uv spectral composites .",
    "the calculation of the far - uv dust attenuation curve is presented in section  [ sec : faruvcurve ] . in section  [ sec :",
    "specfitting ] , we assess whether the dust curve can be used in conjuction with spectral models to reproduce the composite uv spectra .",
    "the implications of our results are discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] , and we summarize in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "all wavelengths are in vacuum .",
    "all magnitudes are expressed in the ab system .",
    "we adopt a cosmology with @xmath16kms@xmath17mpc@xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the galaxies used in our analysis were drawn from the lyman break selected and spectroscopically confirmed sample described in @xcite . in brief , these galaxies were selected as @xmath20 candidates based on their rest - frame uv ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) colors as measured from ground - based imaging of 17 fields . of the 2,347 @xmath23 lyman break galaxy ( lbg )",
    "candidates , 1,293 were observed spectroscopically with the original single channel configuration of the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; @xcite ) on the keck telescopes , with a typical integration time of @xmath24hr .",
    "the spectroscopy was accomplished using the 300linesmm@xmath17 grating blazed at 5000 giving a typical observed wavelength coverage of @xmath25 with 2.47pix@xmath17 dispersion .",
    "the spectral resolution , including the effects of seeing , is @xmath26 in the observed frame .",
    "redshifts were determined from either interstellar absorption lines at @xmath27 , or from ly@xmath14 emission . in some cases",
    ", the detection of a single emission line with a continuum break shortward of that line was used to assign a secure redshift .",
    "our sample includes only those galaxies with secure emission and/or absorption line redshifts that were vetted by at least two people and published in @xcite .",
    "further details of the photometry , candidate selection , followup spectroscopy , and data reduction are provided in @xcite .",
    "subsequent deep ( @xmath28hrs ) spectroscopy was obtained for a sample of 121 @xmath29 galaxies with existing spectroscopic redshifts from the @xcite samples , with the aim of obtaining very sensitive observations of the lyman continuum ( lyc ) emission blueward of the lyman limit ( @xmath30)we refer to the set of objects with deeper spectroscopy as the `` lyc sample '' .",
    "this spectroscopy was obtained using the blue channel of the upgraded double spectrograph mode of lris @xcite , which presents a factor of @xmath31 improvement in throughput at @xmath32 relative to the red - side channel .",
    "the new configuration of lris includes an atmospheric dispersion corrector ( adc ) that eliminates wavelength dependent slit losses .",
    "the deep spectroscopic observations were obtained using the d500 dichroic with the 400linesmm@xmath17 grism blazed at 3400 , yielding a ( binned ) dispersion of 2.18pix@xmath17 . including the effect of seeing , the typical observed - frame resolution is @xmath33 for the blue channel spectra .",
    "redshifts were determined using the same procedure as for the @xcite sample ( see above ) .",
    "the depth of the spectroscopic observations for the lyc sample allowed us to assign absorption line redshifts for @xmath34 of the objects .",
    "the 121 galaxies of the lyc sample excludes all objects ( @xmath35 of the sample ) where the deep spectra indicated a blend between the target lbg and a foreground galaxy .",
    "details of the data reduction and spectroscopy are provided in steidel et al .",
    "( in prep ) .",
    "we further excluded agn from the samples based on the presence of strong uv emission lines ( e.g. , ly@xmath14 and ) .",
    "the agn fraction in the @xmath1 sample ( to the magnitude limit of @xmath36 ) based on strong uv emission lines is @xmath37 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we did not have the requisite multi - wavelength ( infrared , x - ray ) data for the majority of the fields to evaluate agn using other methods .",
    "however , we note that optically - identified agn in uv - selected samples comprise @xmath38 of agn identified either from x - ray emission , or from a mid - infrared excess ( see @xcite ) , and we do not see evidence of agn either in the remaining individual spectra or in the composite spectra",
    ".    two important advantages of the @xmath1 sample that facilitate spectroscopy in the far - uv region is the lower sky background in the observed optical relative to the near - infrared , and the fact that the ly@xmath14 forest is still relatively thin at these redshifts , allowing for the transmission of sufficient flux blueward of ly@xmath14 .",
    "figure  [ fig : zhist ] shows the spectroscopic redshift distribution of our final sample , which includes 933 galaxies .      throughout our analysis , we employed composite spectra which were computed by combining the individual spectra of galaxies .",
    "we first made separate composites of the galaxies in the @xmath1 lbg and lyc samples , and then combined the two resulting composites to obtain a final composite .",
    "this procedure allows us to take advantage of the greater spectroscopic depth of the lyc objects in the far - uv range @xmath39 .    for each galaxy in the @xmath1 lbg sample",
    ", we determined the redshift using either emission ( e.g. , ly@xmath14 ) and/or interstellar absorption lines .",
    "as these features are typically either redshifted ( in the case of emission ) or blueshifted ( in the case of absorption ) due to bulk flows of gas , we computed a systemic redshift from the emission and/or absorption line redshifts using the relations in @xcite .",
    "we then shifted each galaxy s spectrum into the rest frame using the systemic redshift , and interpolated the spectrum to a grid with a wavelength spacing of @xmath40 .",
    "the error spectrum for each galaxy was shifted and interpolated accordingly , and then multiplied by @xmath41 to account for wavelength resampling from the original dispersion of the reduced spectra of 1pix@xmath17 .",
    "each spectrum was scaled according to the median flux density in the range @xmath42 .",
    "the individual galaxy spectra were then averaged , rejecting the upper and lower three flux density values in each @xmath43 interval .",
    "the lyc composite was constructed using a similar procedure , with two exceptions .",
    "first , we did not scale the lyc spectra as the spectroscopic setup ( with the d500 dichroic ) precluded coverage of @xmath42 within the blue channel of lris .",
    "second , we combined the lyc spectra using a weighted average , where the weights are @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the error spectrum .",
    "we still rejected the upper and lower three weighted flux density values in each @xmath43 interval .",
    "the lyc composite was scaled to have the same median flux density in the range @xmath46 as that of the @xmath1 lbg composite .",
    "the final composite results from combining the scaled lyc composite at @xmath47 and the @xmath1 lbg composite at @xmath48 .",
    "we confirmed that this combination does not introduce a systematic bias in the level of the stellar continuum of the composite below and above @xmath49 .",
    "the mean redshifts of the objects contributing to the composite spectrum at the blue ( @xmath50 ) and red ( @xmath51 ) ends of the composite spectrum are @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "given this small difference in redshift , corresponding to @xmath54myr , we assumed that the lbg spectral properties do not vary over this short time interval .",
    "the final composite is shown in figure  [ fig : compall ] , normalized such that the median flux density in the range @xmath42 is unity .",
    "the error spectrum corresponding to the composite was computed as the weighted combination of the error spectra of the individual objects contributing to the composite .",
    "the error in the mean flux of the composite is @xmath55@xmath56jy for the scaling and full wavelength range shown in figure  [ fig : compall ] .",
    "the method of computing the far - uv attenuation curve , @xmath57 , is based on taking the ratios of composite spectra in bins of @xmath4 .",
    "the attenuation curve is defined as @xmath58 , \\label{eq : attcurve}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 and @xmath60 refer to the average flux density and average @xmath4 , respectively , for objects in the _",
    "i_th bin of @xmath4 .",
    "our procedure involves computing the @xmath4 for each galaxy based on its rest - uv ( @xmath61 ) color , and an assumed intrinsic template and attenuation curve .",
    "the template is a combination of the @xcite models and the 2010 version of starburst99 spectral synthesis models in the far - uv @xcite .",
    "the models were computed assuming a stellar metallicity of @xmath62 , based on current solar abundances @xcite , with a constant star - formation history and age of 100myr .",
    "this particular combination of parameters was found to best reproduce the uv stellar wind lines blueward of ly@xmath14 ( e.g. , @xmath631176 ) , as well as the @xmath631240 and @xmath631549 p - cygni profiles .",
    "the star - formation history and age of the model ( @xmath64myr ) were chosen to be consistent with the results from stellar population modeling of @xmath1 lbgs presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "on average , such galaxies exhibit uv - to - near - ir seds and bolometric sfrs that are well - described by either a rising or constant star - formation history @xcite .",
    "for these star - formation histories , the uv spectral shape remains constant for ages @xmath65myr as the relative contribution to the uv light from o and b stars stabilizes after this point .",
    "moreoever , there are no significant correlations between reddening and either star - formation history or age for galaxies in our sample @xcite .",
    "thus , adopting a different model star - formation history and age will serve to systematically shift the computed @xmath4 , but the value of the attenuation curve , which depends on the _ difference _ in the average @xmath4 from bin - to - bin ( equation  [ eq : attcurve ] ) , will be unaffected .",
    "nebular continuum emission was added to the stellar template to produce a final model that we subsquently call the `` intrinsic template . ''",
    "that are systematically smaller ( because the spectrum of the template is redder ) , typically by @xmath66 , than a model that includes only the stellar light . ]",
    "we generated a grid of @xmath61 colors by reddening the intrinsic template assuming @xmath67 , with increments of @xmath68 , and two different attenuation curves : the @xcite and @xcite curves .",
    "the former curve is the most commonly used attenuation curve for high - redshift galaxies .",
    "the latter curve is our most recent determination using a sample of @xmath69 star - forming galaxies at redshifts @xmath70 from the mosfire deep evolution field ( mosdef ; @xcite ) survey .",
    "while lower in redshift than most of the galaxies examined here , the mosdef sample covers roughly the same range in stellar mass and star - formation rate as the latter .",
    "the reddened templates were redshifted and attenuated by the average igm opacity appropriate for that redshift .",
    "the average opacity was determined by randomly drawing line - of - sight absorber column densities from the distribution measured in the keck baryonic structure survey ( kbss ; @xcite ) , and then taking an average over many lines - of - sight .",
    "as the attenuation curve depends only on the ratio of the composite spectra and the difference in their @xmath4 , adopting a different prescription for the igm opacity will not affect the shape of the attenuation curve .",
    "the models were then multiplied by the _",
    "g_- and @xmath71-band transmission filters to produce a model - generated @xmath61 color associated with each @xmath4 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath61 and @xmath4 , and the distribution of @xmath4 for the 933 galaxies in our sample , are shown in figure  [ fig : colordist ] .",
    "we developed an iterative derivation of the attenuation curve which has 7 main steps : ( 1 ) compute the @xmath4 of each object in the sample ; ( 2 ) bin the objects by @xmath4 and construct the composite for each bin ; ( 3 ) determine the average @xmath4 that best fits the composite ; ( 4 ) renormalize the composite to be referenced to a dust - corrected spectrum with a @xmath72 flux density equal to unity ; ( 5 ) compute the @xmath57 curve from the ratio of the composite spectra in different @xmath4 bins , and fit a curve to it ; ( 6 ) compute the variation between the new @xmath57 and that of the previous iteration ; and ( 7 ) repeat steps ( 1 ) through ( 6 ) until the shape of the curve converges .",
    "a flowchart of the procedure is depicted in figure  [ fig : flowchart ] .",
    "our calculation presents several advantages .",
    "first , performing this analysis using the composite spectra of many galaxies allows us to average over stochastic variations in the ly@xmath14 forest so that the resulting composites can be used reliably to measure the far - uv shape of the dust attenuation curve .",
    "second , as noted above , the average stellar populations of galaxies contributing to each bin of @xmath4 are similar . as the far - uv portion of the spectrum",
    "is dominated by only the most massive stars , the shape of the spectrum remains constant after @xmath73myr and is insensitive to the presence of older stellar populations .",
    "third , the stellar mass distribution of @xmath1 lbgs in our sample , which spans the range from a few @xmath74@xmath75 to @xmath76@xmath75 , implies an @xmath77dex difference in mean oxygen abundance from the lowest to highest stellar mass galaxies in our sample , based on the stellar mass - metallicity relation at @xmath1 @xcite . assuming a similar range of stellar metallicities for a fixed star - formation history and imf implies a @xmath78 difference in the intrinsic uv slope across the range of galaxies considered here .",
    "thus , variations in the composite spectral shapes are driven primarily by changes in dust attenuation , rather than by differences in stellar metallicity .",
    "the details of our dust attenuation curve calculation are presented below .      in step 1 , the observed @xmath61 color of each galaxy was corrected for ly@xmath14 emission or absorption as measured from the rest - uv spectrum .",
    "this line - corrected color was compared to the model - generated @xmath61 colors for each attenuation curve in order to find the appropriate @xmath4 . in step 2 , the galaxies were sorted and divided into two bins of @xmath4 , a `` low '' ( `` blue '' ) and `` high '' ( `` red '' ) @xmath4 bin , with roughly an equal number of galaxies in each bin ( 466 and 467 objects , respectively ) . the composite spectrum was computed for the objects in each bin of @xmath4 , resulting in a `` blue '' and `` red '' @xmath4 composite , following the procedure specified in section  [ sec : compspec ] .    for step 3 ,",
    "the best - fit @xmath4 for each composite spectrum was determined by taking the same intrinsic template specified above and reddening it according to the @xcite and @xcite attenuation curves using the same range of @xmath4 specified above .",
    "these models were then redshifted to the mean redshift of objects contributing to the composite , and attenuated according to the igm opacity appropriate for that redshift . the model that best fits the composite spectrum then determines the @xmath4 .",
    "we considered the largely line - free wavelength windows listed under `` composite @xmath4 '' in table  [ tab : waves ] when comparing the model spectrum to the composite .",
    "the best - fit @xmath4 was found by @xmath79 minimization of the model with respect to the composite spectrum .",

    "this renormalization forces the dust - corrected spectrum ( i.e. , the spectrum obtained when de - reddening the composite according to its @xmath4 for a given attenuation curve ) to have @xmath86 .",
    "the new shape of the attenuation curve is computed in step 5 using equation  [ eq : attcurve ] .",
    "we fit the new @xmath57 with a polynomial of the form @xmath87 , where @xmath63 is the wavelength in @xmath56 m . in fitting @xmath57 , we only considered windows in the far - uv ( @xmath88 ) that are free of @xmath5 lines , and which are listed in table  [ tab : waves ] . while the windows do include some metal lines , we confirmed by excluding the wavelength regions corresponding to the weaker interstellar and stellar absorption lines that the presence of such lines did not significantly alter the fit to the attenuation curve .",
    "in addition , we used the errors in the attenuation curve ( see below ) to determine the best - fit polynomial using @xmath79 minimization .    in step 6",
    ", we determined if the new @xmath57 computed in step 5 differed from the assumed @xmath57 ( i.e. , the one from the previous iteration ) by more than @xmath89 at any given wavelength .",
    "if so , the new @xmath57 curve blueward of @xmath72 was spliced onto the @xmath57 from the previous iteration ( note that the curve redward of @xmath72 remains fixed throughout the iterative procedure ) .",
    "this new version of @xmath57 was then used to repeat steps 1 through 6 .",
    "convergence in the shape of the attenuation curve  defined such that the curve varies by no more than @xmath89 at any wavelength from that of the previous iteration  was reached within just two or three iterations .",
    "the curves obtained when initially assuming the @xcite and @xcite attenuation curves are shown in figure  [ fig : attcurve ] .",
    "the best - fit polynomial to the far - uv curve with the @xcite normalization at @xmath72 , and which takes into account the random errors discussed below , is @xmath90 as shown in figure  [ fig : attcurve ] , this polynomial is essentially identical to the fit presented in @xcite for @xmath91 , but deviates from the former curve at shorter wavelengths ( @xmath92 ) . similarly , the functional fit to the curve with the @xcite normalization at @xmath72 is @xmath93 defined over the same wavelength range specified in equation  [ eq : kcalzfit ] .",
    "there are several sources of random error in our calculation of the far - uv attenuation curve .",
    "first are the measurement errors in the composite spectra ( section  [ sec : compspec ] ) .",
    "second are measurement uncertainties in the @xmath61 colors , which can scatter galaxies from one @xmath4 bin to another .",
    "third are deviations away from the attenuation curve from one galaxy to another ( e.g. , due to differences in dust / stars geometries ) , which will affect the @xmath4 inferred for a given @xmath61 color .",
    "fourth are random variations in the igm opacity when averaged over the 466 and 467 sightlines ( 70 and 60 sightlines for @xmath94 ) that contribute to the two @xmath4 bins .",
    "the combined effect of these sources of random error was quantified by calculating @xmath57 many times using the same procedure described above , where each time we ( a ) varied the @xmath61 color of each galaxy according to its measurement uncertainty ; ( b ) perturbed the @xmath4 associated with the @xmath61 color for a given attenuation curve by @xmath95 based on the intrinsic scatter of galaxies used to calibrate the @xcite and @xcite relations , but ensuring that @xmath96 ; ( c ) randomly drew 466 and 467 sightlines ( and 70 and 60 sightlines ) based on the column density distribution measured from kbss ; and ( d ) perturbed the composite spectra according to the corresponding error spectra .",
    "we then computed the dispersion in the fits of the attenuation curve obtained at each wavelength from these simulations to estimate the random error in the attenuation curve . the total random error obtained in this way",
    "is indicated by the shaded regions around the attenuation curves shown in figure  [ fig : attcurve ] .",
    "note that while the random error increases towards bluer wavelengths at @xmath97 , this error is still a factor @xmath98 smaller than the systematic differences between our new determinations of @xmath57 and the extrapolations of the original @xcite and @xcite curves .",
    "thus , the differences between the new far - uv curves derived here and the extrapolations of the original @xcite and @xcite curves at @xmath99 are statistically significant .",
    "the largest source of systematic error in the far - uv curve is the attenuation curve initially assumed for the calculation ( section  [ sec : compspec ] ) , as demonstrated in figure  [ fig : attcurve ] .",
    "the far - uv shape of @xmath57 is similar regardless of whether we have assumed the @xcite or @xcite curves when initially calculating the @xmath4 for galaxies in our sample , but because of the way in which we calculate @xmath57 , the normalization is fixed to that of the initially assumed attenuation curve at 1500 .",
    "thus , the normalization of @xmath57 is unconstrained in our analysis .",
    "a second source of systematic error arises from the fact that the gas covering fractions and/or column densities of and @xmath6 , as well as ism metal absorption , might be expected to increase with @xmath4 .",
    "given that we have computed the attenuation curve in the far - uv where such lines become prevalent ( figure  [ fig : compall ] ) , we must assess whether differences in the average absorption present in the composites for the low and high @xmath4 bins have a significant impact on our calculation of @xmath57such differences would cause us to over - estimate the value of @xmath57 .",
    "this issue is addressed in section  [ sec : specfitting ] .",
    "other sources of systematic uncertainty include our choice of the intrinsic template and the extrapolation of the column density distributions measured in kbss to @xmath100 . both of these have a negligible effect on the derived attenuation curve as systematic changes in the intrinsic template or the extrapolation used to model the ly@xmath14 forest at @xmath100 will tend to systematically shift the @xmath4 of individual objects either up or down , but the ordering of the galaxies in @xmath4 will be preserved .",
    "our calculation marks the first direct measurement of the far - uv attenuation curve at high redshift using spectroscopic data extending to the lyman break at @xmath50 .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig : attcurve ] , the dust curve derived here rises less rapidly at @xmath101 than the polynomial extrapolations of the @xcite and @xcite attenuation curves ; the latter were empirically calibrated for @xmath102 .",
    "the far - uv attenuation curve derived here agrees well with that of @xcite for local star - forming galaxies . for comparison ,",
    "figure  [ fig : attcurve ] also includes the @xcite average extinction curve measured over 75 individual galactic sightlines , and the extinction curve obtained from the dust grain model of @xcite . in general , the far - uv attenuation curve has a shallower dependence on wavelength than the galactic extinction curve , though the comparison is complicated by the fact that the curve derived here is an _ attenuation _ curve which represents an average reddening across many sightlines .",
    "thus , the differences observed between the various curves in the far - uv may be tied to variations in the spatial geometry of the dust and stars , as well as to changes in the dust grain size distribution and scattering and absorption cross - sections",
    ". the new far - uv measurements of the attenuation curves derived here are subsequently referred to as the `` updated '' versions of the @xcite and @xcite curves .",
    "we assessed whether the uv attenuation curve can adequately describe the composite spectra of galaxies in our sample and , in the process , determined the magnitude of any systematic variations in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 column densities , and metal absorption , between the two bins of @xmath4 used to calculate the curve . to accomplish this , we reddened the intrinsic template by various amounts assuming the updated @xcite attenuation curve and a unity covering fraction of dust ( @xmath103 ) , and determined which @xmath4 results in the best fit to the composite spectrum . enforcing @xmath103",
    "was motivated by the fact that the attenuation curve is defined assuming that the entire galaxy is reddened by some average amount .",
    "the fitting was accomplished using the `` composite @xmath4 '' windows specified in table  [ tab : waves ] .",
    "we refer to these as the `` @xmath4 only '' fits ( i.e. , fits that do not include the lines or lyman - werner absorption from @xmath6 ) , and they are shown for the two @xmath4 bins in figure  [ fig : hih2fit ] .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath4 is @xmath104 based on perturbing the composite spectra according to their errors and refitting them many times . while these models provide a good fit to the composite spectra at @xmath105 , they clearly overpredict the observed continuum level at bluer wavelengths , implying that additional absorption must be present at these wavelengths .    at first glance , the discrepancy between the reddened templates and the composite spectra in the far - uv may appear to be at odds with the fact that the attenuation curve was derived from the composite spectra themselves . however , recall that the attenuation curve is calculated from the _ ratio _ of the composite spectra .",
    "systematic absorption in the far - uv that is present in the individual composite spectra will largely `` divide out '' in the calculation of the attenuation curve .    in the next iteration of the spectral fitting",
    ", we accounted for absorption by neutral hydrogen within the galaxies as follows .",
    "we added @xmath5 lyman series absorption to the intrinsic template assuming a voigt profile with a doppler parameter @xmath106kms@xmath17 and varying column densities @xmath80 .",
    "the wings of the line profile are insensitive to the particular choice of @xmath107 .",
    "we also blueshifted the @xmath5 absorption lines relative to the model by @xmath108kms@xmath17 to provide the best match to the observed wavelengths of the lines in the composite .",
    "this blueshift is generally attributed to galactic - scale outflows of gas seen in absorption against the background stellar continuum .",
    "the composite spectra were compared to the model spectra , where the latter were computed as : @xmath109 , \\label{eq : hifit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath110 is the covering fraction of neutral hydrogen ; @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the intrinsic templates with and without @xmath5 absorption , respectively ; and @xmath4 is the value found above ( from the @xmath4 only fitting ) .",
    "note that the reddening was applied to the entire spectrum ; i.e. , @xmath103 .",
    "these final models were computed for a range of @xmath80 and @xmath110 and modified by the igm opacity appropriate for the average redshift of each composite .",
    "the final models were compared to the composite spectra in the `` @xmath80 '' wavelength windows specified in table  [ tab : waves ] to find the best - fitting combination of @xmath80 and @xmath110 .",
    "the wavelength windows were chosen to avoid regions of strong metal line absorption ( e.g. , @xmath63977 and @xmath631036 ) and strong ly@xmath14 emission , and include the core and as much of the wings of ly@xmath113 and ly@xmath114 , and the wings of ly@xmath14 , particularly the region between ly@xmath14 and @xmath631238 .",
    "the higher lyman series lines ( ly@xmath115 and greater ) were not used due to the larger random errors at these wavelengths and because these lines begin to overlap .",
    "the covering fraction is constrained primarily by the depths of the lines , whereas the column density is most sensitive to the wings .",

    "the systematic error in @xmath116}$ ] from changing the doppler parameter by a factor of two from our assumed value is @xmath118})\\approx 0.10$]dex .",
    "note that the values of @xmath110 derived here are physically meaningful only if the @xmath5 lines are optically thick _ and _ the residual flux observed at the @xmath5 line cores is not an artifact of limited spectral resolution , redshift imprecision , or foreground contamination . in the first case ,",
    "a high @xmath80 is required to reproduce the damping wings of ly@xmath14 , ly@xmath113 , and ly@xmath114 , implying optically thick gas . in the second case , as shown in detail in reddy et  al .",
    "( 2016b ) , redshift and spectral resolution uncertainties are not sufficient to account for the residual flux seen at the @xmath5 line centers .",
    "briefly , we executed simulations where we added @xmath5 of varying column densities to the intrinsic spectrum , replicated many versions of this @xmath5-absorbed spectrum with slightly different redshifts based on the typical redshift uncertainty for galaxies in our sample , smoothed these versions with various values of the spectral resolution , and then produced a composite of all these versions .",
    "this exercise revealed that we would have had to systematically underestimate the rest - frame spectral resolution by more than @xmath120 in order to reproduce the amount of residual flux at the @xmath5 line centers .",
    "this @xmath120 is much larger than the rms uncertainties in determining the spectral resolution from the widths of night sky lines .",
    "lastly , we ruled out foreground contamination as a source of the residual flux based on the exclusion of spectroscopic blends from our sample and the fact that this flux inversely correlates with reddening , a result that would not be expected if the flux was dominated by foreground contaminants ( see reddy et  al .",
    "2016b for more discussion ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the spectra can be modeled with a partial covering fraction of optically thick @xmath5 .    in the final iteration of the fitting",
    ", we included @xmath6 lyman - werner absorption in the models as follows : @xmath121,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath122 is the covering fraction of molecular hydrogen , @xmath123 is the model including both @xmath5 and @xmath6 absorption , and the remaining variables have the same definitions as in equation  [ eq : hifit ] .",
    "this calculation assumes that the @xmath6 is entirely embedded in @xmath5 clouds .",
    "@xmath6 absorption was modeled using the @xcite templates , assuming a doppler parameter @xmath124kms@xmath17 , and all vibrational transitions from the first vibrational mode , and the @xmath125 transitions .",
    "the templates were smoothed to match the resolution of the composite spectra . in fitting the models to the composite spectra , the @xmath4 , @xmath80 , and @xmath110",
    "were fixed to the values found above , and @xmath81 and @xmath122 were allowed to vary .",
    "the `` best - fit '' @xmath81 and @xmath126 were found by minimizing the differences in the model and composite spectra in the four wavelength windows indicated by the `` @xmath81 '' entry in table  [ tab : waves ] .",
    "these windows were chosen because they are free from @xmath5 absorption and strong metal line absorption as identified in far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) spectra of the lmc by @xcite .",
    "the best - fitting models including @xmath6 are shown in figure  [ fig : hih2fit ] , and we find @xmath127 and @xmath128}\\approx 20.9 $ ] . as the @xmath6 lines are blended and unresolved , we can not accurately determine the errors in the fitted parameters .",
    "nevertheless , we note that the deficit in flux of the composites relative to the models which _ do not _ include the lyman - werner bands in the four @xmath6 windows ( table  [ tab : waves ] ) implies that @xmath6 absorption must be present , albeit with a low covering fraction or low column density ( figure  [ fig : h2fit ] ) .",
    "is expected to be weak relative to the absorption arising from transitions from the ground vibrational state for the typical conditions in the ism .",
    "transitions from the ground vibrational state ( for the six rotational transitions considered here , @xmath129 ) completely blanket the far - uv continuum given the resolution of our spectra . thus , adding absorption corresponding to upper level vibrational transitions will simply remove `` power '' from the considered ( ground state vibrational ) mode and the column densities and covering fractions derived here would be upper limits . ]",
    "the apparently low covering fraction of @xmath6 relative to that of the @xmath5 and dust implies that most of the dust in the ism of typical galaxies at @xmath1 is unrelated to the catalysis of @xmath6 molecules , and is associated with other phases of the ism ( e.g. , ionized and neutral gas ) .",
    "this result is robust against the assumption of a non - unity covering fraction of dust . in other words ,",
    "as shown in reddy et  al .",
    "( 2016b ) , assuming a _ partial _ covering fraction of dust yields dust covering fractions that are @xmath130 , still much larger than the covering fraction deduced for @xmath6 .",
    "the aforementioned fitting demonstrates that the updated @xcite curve provides a reasonable fit to the composite spectra over the entire far - uv through near - uv range once @xmath5 and @xmath6 absorption are accounted for .",
    "we found similar results when considering the updated @xcite attenuation curve .",
    "moreover , the column density and covering fraction of @xmath6 indicate a similar degree of absorption of the far - uv continuum between the blue and red @xmath4 bins , implying that systematic differences in this absorption are negligible and thus unlikely to bias our estimate of the far - uv shape of the dust attenuation curve . in comparison ,",
    "the original versions of these dust curves imply a far - uv rise that is too steep to simultaneously model the mid - uv range used to compute @xmath4 ( @xmath131 ) and the far - uv at @xmath132 ( figure  [ fig : hih2fit ] ) .",
    "a primary result of our analysis is that the far - uv attenuation curve rises less rapidly toward bluer wavelengths ( @xmath133 ) relative to other commonly assumed attenuation curves .",
    "a consequence of this less - rapid far - uv rise is a lower attenuation of lyc photons by dust . in particular",
    ", the average @xmath4 for galaxies in our @xmath1 sample is @xmath134 and @xmath135 if we assume the @xcite and @xcite reddening curves , respectively . for these values ,",
    "the attenuation of lyc photons at @xmath136 is a factor of @xmath137 lower than that inferred using polynomial extrapolations of the @xcite and @xcite curves at @xmath138 .",
    "clearly , this result has implications for the fraction of hydrogen - ionizing photons that escape galaxies before being absorbed by hydrogen in the igm or cgm , i.e. , the ionizing escape fraction . at face value",
    ", this result implies a larger escape fraction of ionizing photons for galaxies of a given dust reddening .",
    "however , as discussed in reddy et  al .",
    "( 2016b ) , the actual covering fraction of neutral gas likely plays a larger role in modulating the escape of such photons than attenuation by dust . specifically , the dominant mode by which ionizing photons escape @xmath9 galaxies at @xmath1 is through channels that have been cleared of gas and dust , while other sightlines are characterized by optically - thick @xmath5 that extinguishes ionizing photons through photoelectric absorption ( reddy et  al .",
    "regardless , our new determinations of the far - uv dust curve have direct applications to assessing the attenuation of ionizing photons either internal to regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) or  in the context of high - redshift galaxies  in the ionized galactic - scale ism or in low column density neutral gas ( i.e. , @xmath116}\\la 17.2 $ ] ) , where dust absorption begins to dominate the depletion of ionizing photons .",
    "the revised shape of the far - uv curve also has consquences for the reddening and ages of galaxies derived from stellar population ( i.e. , sed ) modeling . to illustrate this",
    ", we considered 1,874 galaxies from kbss that have ground - based @xmath139 , near - ir intermediate - band ( @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 ) , and broad - band ( @xmath144 , @xmath145 ) photometry , along with _ hubble space telescope _",
    "wfc3/ir f160w and _ spitzer space telescope _ irac imaging ( strom et  al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "we fit @xcite @xmath146 stellar population models to the photometry , assuming a constant star - formation history , @xmath4 in the range 0.0 - 0.6 , and ages from @xmath147myr to the age of the universe at the redshift of each galaxy ( a full description of the sed - fitting procedure is provided in @xcite ) .",
    "the modeling was performed assuming the original form of the @xcite attenuation curve as well as the updated version ( i.e. , which incorporates the new shape of the far - uv curve found here ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : sedcomparison ] shows the comparison between the reddening and ages derived for galaxies in kbss as function of redshift , for the two versions of the attenuation curve .",
    "a less rapid rise of the far - uv attenuation curve implies that a larger reddening is required to reproduce the rest - uv color , which in turn makes the galaxies appear younger .",
    "thus , the updated attenuation curve results in @xmath4 that are on average @xmath148mag redder , and ages that are on average @xmath149myr younger , than those derived with the original @xcite curve . the redder @xmath4 result in sfrs that are about @xmath150 larger , while the stellar masses do not change appreciably .",
    "of course , the magnitude of the effect of changing the far - uv attenuation curve on the derived stellar population parameters depends on which bands are being fit . for galaxies at @xmath15 , where the ly@xmath14 forest is thin and the @xmath151 and @xmath152-bands probe the rest - frame far - uv",
    ", we find systematic offsets in both the reddening and ages of galaxies .",
    "to summarize , we have used a large sample of 933 spectroscopically confirmed @xmath153 lbgs at @xmath1 , 121 of which have very deep spectroscopic coverage in the range @xmath154 , in order to deduce the shape of the far - uv ( @xmath0 ) dust attenuation curve .",
    "we used an iterative procedure to construct composite spectra of the @xmath1 lbgs in bins of continuum color excess , @xmath4 , and , by taking ratios of these spectra , we calculated the far - uv wavelength dependence of the dust attenuation curve .",
    "the curve found here implies a lower attenuation at @xmath12 relative to that inferred from simple polynomial extrapolations of the @xcite and @xcite attenuation curves .",
    "our new determination of the far - uv shape of the dust curve enables more accurate estimates of the effect of dust on the attenuation of hydrogen - ionizing ( lyc ) photons .",
    "specifically , our results imply a factor of @xmath8 lower attenuation of lyc photons for typical @xmath4 relative to that deduced from simple extrapolations of the most widely used attenuation curves at high redshift .",
    "our results may be used to assess the degree of lyc attenuation internal to regions , in the ionized media of high - redshift galaxies , or in low column density ism ( @xmath116}\\la 17.2 $ ] ) .",

    "the inferred covering fraction of @xmath6 is very low ( @xmath156 ) and , when contrasted with the high covering fraction of dust , suggests that most of the dust in the ism of high - redshift galaxies is not associated with the catalysis of @xmath6 .",
