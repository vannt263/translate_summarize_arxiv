    "resolving the transversal ( or radial ) structure in extragalactic jets is a crucial step in our understanding of the physics of these objects .",
    "on parsec scales , this has become feasible only recently , using space vlbi observations with the vsop @xcite .",
    "these observations revealed the presence of a double helical structure inside the jet of 3c  273 , which can be attributed to a combination of the helical and elliptic modes of kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability .",
    "numerical simulations further support this interpretation @xcite .",
    "we report here on further progress of this investigation .",
    "we use vsop observations of the radio jet in the quasar s50836 + 710 at 1.6 and 5ghz to estimate basic physical properties of the relativistic flow , focusing specifically on the radial profiles of its velocity and density .",
    "the luminous quasar s50836 + 710 at a redshift @xmath0 hosts a powerful radio jet extending up to kiloparsec scales @xcite .",
    "vlbi monitoring of the source @xcite has yielded estimates of the bulk lorentz factor @xmath1 and the viewing angle @xmath2 of the flow .",
    "presence of an instability developing in the jet is suggested by the kink structures observed on milliarcsecond scales with ground vlbi @xcite .    in the vsop image of 0836 + 710 at @xmath3 , oscillations of the jet ridge line",
    "are observed @xcite , with a wavelength of @xmath4 .",
    "in addition to this , a @xmath5 periodicity is found in the the spectral index distribution .",
    "using the vortex sheet approximation @xcite , these structures have been identified with the helical surface and elliptic surface modes of kh instability , yielding estimates of basic physical properties of the flow : the lorentz factor @xmath6 , mach number @xmath7 and jet / ambient medium density ratio @xmath8 .",
    "high dynamic range vlba observations of 0836 + 710 at @xmath9 show the presence of an oscillation at a wavelength as long as @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "[ fig : ridge ] shows a @xmath9 image of the jet with the ridge line of the emission overprinted .",
    "the image also shows the identification of the 100 mas wave .",
    "this wavelength can not be readily reconciled with the jet parameters determined from the two shorter wavelength oscillations , indicating that the flow may have a complex , stratified transversal structure in which emission at lower frequencies originates from outer layers of the flow .",
    "there are two basic explanations for the fact that the longest wavelength does not fit within the scenario described above : 1 )  the jet parameters derived may not be exact , or 2 )  the approximations and assumptions used in the kh linear theory are not strictly valid . in this work",
    "we use the parameters derived in @xcite from the spectral evolution in the jet , and relax the approximation to vortex sheet contact discontinuity between the jet and the ambient medium , used in the stability analysis in @xcite , exploring the possibility of the jet being sheared .",
    "we show that the presence of a shear layer allows to fit all the observed wavelengths within a single set of parameters , assuming that they are produced due to kh instabilities growing in a cylindrical outflow . in this picture",
    ", the longest mode corresponds to a surface mode growing in the outer layers , whereas the shorter wavelengths are identified with body modes developing in the inner radii of the jet .    in section  2 , we describe the method used to solve the linear stability problem for cylindric relativistic flows and provide the respective solutions for the set of parameters given in @xcite . these solutions are compared in section  3 with the wavelengths observed in the jet of 0836 + 710 .",
    "section  4 summarizes the main results of this work and puts them in the broader context of the physics of relativistic outflows .",
    "we describe the flow in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 defining the radial and axial directions , respectively .",
    "we consider a sheared transition in the axial velocity , @xmath14 and the rest mass density , @xmath15 , between the jet and the ambient medium of the following form ( see @xcite for a detailed description of the linear analysis ) @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the profiled quantity ( @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) and @xmath18 , @xmath19 are its values at the jet symmetry plane ( at @xmath20 ) and at @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the integer @xmath22 controls the steepness of the shear layer . in the limit @xmath23 ,",
    "the configuration turns into the vortex - sheet case , as described by @xcite .",
    "the jet and the ambient medium are in pressure equilibrium .",
    "an adiabatic perturbation of the form @xmath24 $ ] is introduced in the equations of the flow , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the frequency and longitudinal wavenumber of the perturbation , respectively , and the function @xmath27 defines the radial structure of the perturbation .",
    "the units used are the jet radius , @xmath28 , and the speed of light , @xmath29 .",
    "after some algebra , we obtain the following second order differential equation for the pressure perturbation ( equation 13 in @xcite @xcite ) : @xmath30 equation [ radial - eq ] is solved by applying the _ shooting method _ @xcite .",
    "this method requires integration of the equation from the jet axis to a point outside the jet .",
    "we impose boundary conditions on the amplitude of the pressure perturbation and on its first derivative on the jet axis , depending on the symmetry or antisymmetry of the perturbation on the jet axis .",
    "then , for a given frequency ( @xmath25 ) , a complex wavenumber is given .",
    "the integration is done using a variable - step runge - kutta method @xcite .",
    "when the integration reaches the given point outside the jet , the value obtained is compared with the boundary conditions there : the sommerfeld condition , requiring the solutions to approach zero at infinity , and the requirement of no incoming waves at infinity .",
    "these conditions ensure that the solutions can be given by bessel functions inside the jet and hankel functions outside .",
    "appropriate values of the complex wavenumber that fit into those conditions are searched using the mller method @xcite .",
    "as stated above , the solutions are obtained in the spatial domain , i.e. , assuming @xmath25 is real and @xmath31 is complex . in this description ,",
    "the inverse of the imaginary part of the wavenumber , @xmath32 , gives the growth length ( or _ e_-folding length ) , defined as the distance at which the perturbation amplitude increases by one exponential factor .",
    "we adopt the jet parameters derived in @xcite and solve the pressure perturbation equation with several different values of @xmath22 .",
    "the resulting solutions are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sols ] for the helical instability modes and for two values of @xmath22 : @xmath33 ( left panels ) and @xmath34 ( right panels ) .",
    "the @xmath33 case corresponds to a broad shear layer of @xmath35 in width , whereas the @xmath34 one implies a shear layer width of @xmath36 , i.e. , approaching the vortex - sheet case .         the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : sols ] indicate that , in thicker shear layers ( @xmath33 ) , the surface mode grows faster than the body modes . the minimum growth lengths ( maximum @xmath37 ) of the surface mode , indicated by vertical dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : sols ] , are realized at long wavelengths ( horizontal dashed lines show the wavenumber of the mode ) : @xmath38 , at @xmath39 .",
    "the smallest growth lengths of all body modes are achieved by the fifth and sixth order body modes at @xmath40 .    for a thin shear layer ( @xmath34 ) the minimum growth lengths of low order helical body modes are similar to that of the helical surface mode , with the minimum realized for the first body mode at @xmath41 .",
    "the minimum growth length of the surface modes shifts to higher frequencies and shorter wavelengths ( @xmath42 ) compared to the respective values obtained for @xmath33 . for @xmath43 ,",
    "the growths of all the modes are strongly reduced as the width of the shear layer is increased . for @xmath44",
    "the solutions converge to the vortex - sheet case also at the highest frequencies / shortest wavelengths .",
    "the solutions of the linear stability problem obtained in the previous section can be compared with the wavelengths observed in the jet in 0836 + 710 .",
    "this comparison requires an estimate of the radius of the jet , in order to convert the frequencies and wavenumbers of the solution into physical units .",
    "the true jet radius can be estimated from the vlba radio maps presented in @xcite , using the following relation : @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the observed width of the jet and @xmath47 is the beam width transversally to the direction of the jet .",
    "we measure the diameter of the jet and the beamwidth at @xmath48 of the peak emission @xcite at the base of the jet , implicitly assuming that the outer parts of the shear layer emit less than 1% of the radio power at these frequencies .",
    "this yields the jet radii of @xmath49mas and @xmath50mas at 1.6ghz and 5ghz , respectively .",
    "if the jet is assumed to be sheared , the radius we need to consider is that at 1.6ghz , as it includes the outer , slower layers of the jet .",
    "thus , taking the radius of the jet to be @xmath51mas , the @xmath52mas structure turns into @xmath53 , and the @xmath54mas into @xmath55 .",
    "the intrinsic ( rest frame ) wavelengths derived from the solutions to eq .",
    "[ radial - eq ] shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : sols ] , @xmath56 , can then be transformed to the observer s frame and expressed also in units of @xmath57 .",
    "the observed wavelengths are obtained by adding the corrections for relativistic motion , projection and cosmological effects through the following relation : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the observed wavelength , @xmath12 is the redshift , @xmath60 is the wave speed and @xmath61 is the jet angle to the line of sight .",
    "the wave speed @xmath62 is obtained from the solutions to the linear problem ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sols ] ) .",
    "we focus first in the helical surface mode , most likely responsible for the longest observed wavelength of 100mas . the wave speed of the helical surface mode ranges from @xmath63 to @xmath64 , for the thicker and thinner shear - layer , respectively .",
    "we obtain , in the case of the thick shear layer , a wavelength of @xmath65 , whereas in the case of a thin shear layer we obtain @xmath66 .    for the case of the body modes ,",
    "visible at 5ghz , we find a wave speed of @xmath67 for the fifth and sixth body modes ( those with the fastest growths ) in the case of a thick shear layer , and a wave speed of @xmath68 for the first body mode in the case of a thin shear layer .",
    "these modes would produce structure with an observed wavelengths of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "the wavelengths obtained for the thick shear layer are close to those observed : @xmath65 from theory compared to @xmath71 from the observations for the longest structure and @xmath69 from theory compared to @xmath72 from the observations .",
    "this agreement is also remarkable in the case of the @xmath73mas structure , identified in @xcite as an elliptic mode and not discussed here .",
    "this leads us to conclude that the jet is transversally stratified ( i.e. , has a thick shear layer ) , although the lack of error estimates precludes us from ruling out firmly the scenario with a thin shear layer .",
    "the description developed in this work explains all three major oscillations observed in the jet of 0836 + 710 , if the flow speed and density are both transversely stratified .",
    "the longest observed wavelength of 100mas represents the helical surface mode , whereas the two shorter ones ( 7.7mas and 4.6mas ) are identified with the fifth / sixth order helical and elliptic body modes , respectively .",
    "the former is observed in the images of the jet at @xmath74ghz ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ridge ] ) and the latter are observed at @xmath75ghz .",
    "the whole picture fits into the theory if the radius of the jet at the lowest observed frequency is taken , implying that the body modes have their maxima at inner regions of the jet than the surface mode .",
    "if we take the radius of the jet at @xmath75ghz , the short observed wavelengths may be interpreted as surface modes and the longest mode can not , in that case , be explained by kh theory @xcite .",
    "a second implication of this result is that the radiating particles emitting at @xmath3 occupy a central spine in a stratified jet , while the longer - wavelength structure seen at 1.6ghz is generated in outer layers of the flow .",
    "one possible alternative to the stratified jet scenario is to consider deviations of the basic jet parameters from those derived in @xcite . to assess this alternative ,",
    "we have calculated the solutions of the stability equation for different sets of parameters , varying the jet lorentz factor , rest - mass density ratio and specific internal energy .",
    "we conclude that the jet in 0836 + 710 must have ( on axis ) a lorentz factor close to 12 or slightly smaller , a density ratio of @xmath76@xmath77 and a sound speed @xmath78 or slightly larger  not deviating much from the parameters derived in @xcite , which supports the conclusions derived in this paper .",
    "further work in the stability analysis would focus on solving the differential equation for the pressure perturbation ( eq .",
    "1 ) using a relativistic equation of state that allows for inclusion of different families of particles .",
    "this will enable testing the solutions for a proton - electron jet and an electron - positron jet , providing an useful insight into the jet composition .",
    "it has been shown by @xcite that the helical surface mode of kh instability can be driven by an external periodic process . in this case , coupling this process to the helical surface mode requires the driving frequency to be lower than the resonant frequency . for 0836 + 710 ,",
    "the driving frequency of the helical surface mode at its minimum growth length is @xmath79 would imply a driving period of @xmath80 .",
    "this is similar to the driving period of @xmath81 found for 3c449 @xcite .",
    "periodic variations of the jet ejection axis can be produced by a number of physical processes , including a binary black hole and a misaligned torus as the most plausible @xcite .",
    "however , a misaligned torus can only produced a period of @xmath82 , depending on the accretion disk and black - hole properties @xcite in the case of 0836 + 710 ( @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , if we combine the value derived for @xmath83 with the estimate of the black hole mass in 0836 + 710 ( @xmath84 ; @xcite @xcite ) , we obtain a companion mass of @xmath85 , depending on the separation between the two black holes ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the latter is thus a possible explanation for the precession period obtained from our analysis .",
    "finally , the kiloparsec - scale structure of 0836 + 710 shows a large , decollimated feature @xcite , without any emission between it and the @xmath9 jet .",
    "new observations with high dynamic range that have already been performed will give us more insight into the properties of this jet on the kiloparsec scales and could show whether the cause of the decollimation on the kiloparsec scales is the disruption of the jet by the @xmath52mas structure , identified here as a helical surface mode .",
