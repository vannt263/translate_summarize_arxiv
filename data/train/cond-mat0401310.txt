    "the best understood random graphs are those with uncorrelated nodes and a local tree structure .",
    "it was natural to develop the statistical mechanics of random networks starting with this highly idealized picture , as it is natural to begin explaining the properties of gases starting with the ideal ones .",
    "however , short loops show up in most real networks relatively frequently and it is evident that current models should be upgraded to capture this common trait ( the present state of art in network research is excellently reviewed in refs .",
    "a possible strategy consists in adding to the hamiltonian a term favouring the appearance of specific motifs .",
    "this strategy was adopted in our recent publication @xcite , where erds - rnyi graphs were perturbed by adding to the action a term proportional to the number of triangles @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to outline a possible generalization of the discussion of ref .",
    "@xcite to the case where in zeroth order the graphs belong to the statistical ensemble of simple ( _ i.e. _ non - degenerate ) graphs with uncorrelated nodes and an _ arbitrary _ degree distribution @xmath0 .",
    "the partition function of the perturbed model is written in the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the number of nodes and links , respectively , the sum is over adjacency matrices m , @xmath4 is the degree of the @xmath5-th node satisfying @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the perturbing hamiltonian . setting @xmath8",
    "one obtains a standard model of networks with uncorrelated nodes and the degree distribution @xmath0 ( provided the relation @xmath9 holds , see for example refs @xcite ) . in the second line",
    "we denote by @xmath10 the average taken in the unperturbed ensemble and therefore @xmath11 is , obviously , the partition function of the unperturbed model , in our context an irrelevant overall factor ( it can be calculated analytically in the large @xmath2 limit , see _ eg .",
    "_ @xcite , but we do not need this result here )",
    ".    one can , of course , go over from ( [ pf ] ) to a grand - canonical ensemble , with fluctuating @xmath3 , multiplying ( [ pf ] ) by an appropriate @xmath3-dependent weight and summing over @xmath3 . in the erds - rnyi theory",
    "there is a very natural and simple recipe for the weight .",
    "hence , in @xcite we were grand - canonical . here ,",
    "we find it more elegant to keep the number of links fixed . notice , that we are interested in the large @xmath2 limit where , for any reasonable choice of the weight , @xmath3 stays anyhow close to its average value as a consequence of the constraint @xmath12 and of the central limit theorem .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite we set for definiteness @xmath13 . expanding the exponential in ( [ pf ] )",
    "we obtain a perturbative series representing the partition function .",
    "this perturbative representation was thoroughly studied in ref . @xcite and",
    "the analytic arguments were completed by numerical simulations .",
    "let us recall the salient conclusions of this study :    we have introduced a diagrammatic representation of possible contributions to the perturbative expansion , reminiscent of feynman diagrams used in field theory .",
    "each diagram is a specific subgraph of the full random graph .",
    "we have shown that the number of contributing diagrams grows factorially with the order of the perturbation theory .",
    "as is well known , such a factorial growth of the number of diagrams signals a breakdown of the perturbation theory .",
    "indeed , our numerical simulations indicate the presence of a transition from a smooth , perturbative regime to a crumpled phase , where almost all nodes form a complete clique @xcite .",
    "the transition point @xmath14 scales like @xmath15 .",
    "the two phases are separated by a `` barrier '' which becomes impenetrable when @xmath16 .",
    "remarkably enough it is possible to sum up the leading diagrams , _",
    "i.e. _ those whose contribution survives in the limit @xmath16 .",
    "thus , for example , we have been able to derive a closed analytic expression for the average number of triangles .",
    "it turns out , that at large enough @xmath2 this analytic formula is a very good approximation in the almost whole region @xmath17 . setting @xmath18",
    "one obtains a network model with a nontrivially behaving clustering coefficient @xmath19 .",
    "this clustering coefficient is never constant , it falls to zero as @xmath16 , but this fall can be made fairly slow by a proper choice of @xmath20 .",
    "the results summarized above are the starting point of the present paper , which is a direct continuation of ref .",
    "@xcite . in sect .",
    "ii we extend our diagrammatic rules to general uncorrelated graphs with a given degree distribution .",
    "we also show that the results of ref .",
    "@xcite continue to hold , only slightly modified , in this generalized set - up .",

    "the perturbation series is defined as in @xcite .",
    "one calculates the successive terms in the expansion @xmath21^n",
    "\\rangle\\ ] ] this boils down to the calculation of the expectation value of strings like @xmath22 .",
    "a string does not vanish iff all the matrix elements it involves are equal to unity .",
    "the only problem is that the same element , or its transpose , can appear several times in the same string and one needs , therefore , to catalogue all possible string structures ( _ cf . _",
    "this is done with the help of diagrams :    each matrix element @xmath23 is represented by a line segment with endpoints @xmath24 and @xmath25 . a string",
    "is then represented by a collection of @xmath26 triangles , possibly glued together . in order to calculate the perturbation series one has to consider all possible diagrams .",
    "the meaning and the construction of diagrams is explained at length in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the help of explicit examples .",
    "we will not repeat this discussion here , referring the reader to the original paper .",
    "we wish only to insist on the salient steps :    \\(a ) all @xmath26-th order terms of the series are , of course , proportional to the common factor @xmath27 .",
    "\\(b ) every diagram is a subgraph which has to be embedded in the full graph .",
    "an @xmath26-th order diagram has , say , @xmath28 vertices and @xmath29 .",
    "these @xmath28 vertices can be identified with graph nodes in @xmath30 manners .",
    "\\(c ) the same diagram topology usually represents a number of distinct strings .",
    "the calculation of this number is the relatively difficult part of the game .",
    "but it is universal , in the sense that it does not depend on the degree distribution .",
    "the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite were done for the erds - rnyi graph , but hold quite generally .",
    "\\(d ) finally , one has to find the expectation value of the string corresponding to a given diagram . in erds - rnyi theory",
    "this is simple : if a diagram has @xmath31 edges , then there are @xmath31 independent adjacency matrix elements in the string and the expectation value is just @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the control parameter equal to @xmath34 when the average degree is set to be finite .",
    "the case of a general model of uncorrelated graphs with a given degree distribution requires some extra thought .",
    "we will use an argument which is not quite original , since it has already been employed by other authors in a somewhat different context ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite )  :    the probability that nodes @xmath35 are connected is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the degree of a - th ( b - th)node and @xmath38 . notice that @xmath39 equals the number of directed links .",
    "the probability in question is inversely proportional to the total number of directed links and is proportional to the degrees of the nodes .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) holds when the right - hand side is small enough , _",
    "i.e. _ at large @xmath2 .",
    "the probability that @xmath25 is in turn connected to , say , @xmath40 is however @xmath41 because one link emerging from @xmath25 , the one connecting @xmath25 to @xmath24 , is already occupied : only @xmath42 links are potentially `` active '' . pursuing the argument",
    "one derives the following rules  :    \\(a ) a factor @xmath43 is associated with every edge of the diagram , and    \\(b ) a factor @xmath44 is associated with every vertex , say @xmath24 , of the diagram : here @xmath45 is the degree of the @xmath24-th graph node and @xmath46 is the degree of the same node regarded as the diagram vertex .",
    "this was for a particular graph .",
    "averaging , one is led to replace @xmath47 in the above rules given above @xcite .",
    "we have assumed here that node degrees are uncorrelated , which strictly speaking is only true in the limit @xmath16 . even in a so - called uncorrelated network some `` kinematic '' correlations appear when one imposes the constraint that there are no self and multiple connections between nodes and when @xmath48 is not always negligible @xcite .",
    "the last condition is easily satisfied when the degree distribution is defined on a finite support , but may be jeopardized in scale - free networks .",
    "let us check that for erds - rnyi graphs one gets the result of ref .",
    "@xcite : when the degree distribution is poissonian the average of a binomial moment is just a power of @xmath49  : @xmath50 of course , one has @xmath51 furthermore , in erds - rnyi theory @xmath52 . hence the diagram with @xmath31 vertices gets a factor @xmath53 this is exactly what one has in the grand - canonical erds - rnyi ensemble and also what one expects in our setup in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "we are now equipped to calculate the contribution of an arbitrary diagram .",
    "for example , in the limit @xmath54 the average number of triangles in a graph , the derivative of the free energy with respect to @xmath55 , equals @xmath56 because the diagram has three vertices of order two .",
    "hence , each vertex contributes a factor @xmath57 - remember that vertices are independent - while each link contributes a factor @xmath58 .",
    "the powers of @xmath2 cancel , as in the calculation of ref . @xcite and",
    "the only difference is that now instead of @xmath49 appears a ratio of binomial moments of the degree distribution @xmath0 .",
    "higher order diagrams call for other binomial moments .",
    "it is important to realize that as long as all the moments of @xmath0 are finite - and therefore @xmath2-independent for large enough network size - the hierarchy of diagrams in the @xmath59 expansion is the same as in ref .",
    "in particular , the same diagrams are leading .",
    "summing the leading diagrams , _",
    "i.e. _ those whose contribution remains finite when @xmath16 , one gets @xmath60 which generalizes eq .",
    "( 36 ) of ref .",
    "higher order moments ( cumulants ) of the @xmath61-distribution are obtained by differentiating the right - hand side of ( [ tvsg ] ) with respect to @xmath55 .",
    "one finds that the distribution is poissonian .",
    "the situation changes when the moments of @xmath0 are not necessarily finite . without much loss of generality",
    "we will limit our attention to the so - called scale - free graphs , _",
    "i.e. _ those where @xmath0 falls at large @xmath62 like a power : @xmath63 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath64 is finite : @xmath65 .",
    "when @xmath66 at @xmath67 , the moments of order larger than @xmath68 diverge . actually , at large but finite @xmath2 , the degree distribution of a non - degenerate uncorrelated graph is cut at @xmath69 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a derivation of this result ) . hence , higher order moments of the degree distribution increase like some powers of @xmath2 and , consequently , the hierarchy of the @xmath59 expansion is modified compared to ref .",
    "it turns out that three cases require a separate discussion :     additions of a triangle to a diagram , leading to the increase of the number of diagram links by three ( a ) , two ( b ) and one ( c).,width=226 ]      we will prove that the leading diagrams are the same as those considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , _ i.e. _ those where the number of triangle edges is equal to the number of triangle vertices .",
    "one can easily see that in these diagrams the triangles can overlap , but otherwise do not touch .",
    "the proof is by induction .",
    "first we observe that the diagram of order @xmath71 ( one triangle ) is leading and its contribution tends to a constant as @xmath16 .",
    "higher order diagrams can be constructed by adding successive triangles .",
    "suppose that at the @xmath26-th order the leading diagrams are those with the number of links equal to the number of triangles .",
    "what happens when one adds the @xmath72-st triangle ? if it is put on top of an existing triangle or if it is isolated , the new diagram scales with @xmath2 the same way as its ancestor . in general ,",
    "the new triangle is not isolated and its addition increases the number of links .",
    "three possibilities , illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , can arise .",
    "because of ( [ cut ] ) increasing the degree of a diagram vertex by @xmath73 links produces at most an extra divergent factor @xmath74 when the number of links is increased by three ( fig .",
    "1a ) @xmath75 in three vertices .",
    "the new links yield a factor @xmath76 each .",
    "thus the new global factor is at most @xmath77 similarly , for figs .",
    "1b , c one finds that the potentially dangerous new factor is at most @xmath78 respectively .",
    "for @xmath70 these factors do not diverge .",
    "we conclude that the leading diagrams are those considered in ref .",
    "the average number of triangles is finite in the limit @xmath16 and is given by eq .",
    "( [ tvsg ] ) .      as already recalled , at finite @xmath2 the degree distribution is cut and the cut - off scales like @xmath80 . of course , the cut - off is not sharp , but in calculations it is convenient to replace it by a sharp one @xmath81 .",
    "the determination of the constant @xmath40 is not obvious .",
    "we make a choice which yields more or less correct moments of the cut degree distribution : at large enough @xmath2 @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( the sharp cut - off upsets the normalization , but the effect is negligible for large @xmath2 ) . the constant @xmath40 can be roughly estimated using eq .",
    "( [ mom ] ) : @xmath84 let us calculate the leading @xmath2-dependence of an arbitrary diagram with @xmath31 edges and @xmath28 vertices : one has a global factor ( we omit logs )    @xmath85     leading diagram for @xmath86.,width=188 ]    since each link yields @xmath76 , the @xmath28 vertices yield @xmath87 and the binomial moments associated with @xmath28 vertices yield the sum in the exponent .",
    "however , this sum can be calculated : @xmath88 .",
    "hence , the total exponent is zero , only logs remain .    as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , calculating the average number of triangles at large @xmath2 it is sufficient to consider connected diagrams only . at each order of perturbation theory",
    "the leading connected diagram is the one with the largest number of vertices of order 2 , _",
    "i.e. _ the diagram shown in fig .",
    "2 . in the @xmath26-th order we have @xmath26 triangles and",

    "the central vertex has order @xmath90 .",
    "each triangle in fig .",
    "2 can be glued to the central vertex in three manners .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath26-th order diagram to the free energy is therefore ( for @xmath91 ) : @xmath92 where we have used the the asymptotic result @xmath93 in this limit eq .",

    "distribution scales again like @xmath80 .",
