    "it is evident that the different hadronization scenarios have little influence on the k factor which is necessary to describe the data . for a constant coupling constant and the debye mass as ir regulator ( model b )",
    "one has to employ k - factors of the order of 10 - 12 . a smaller ir regulator ( model c ) or a running coupling constant ( model d )",
    "reduce this k factor to values of 5 - 10 , still much too large in order to render the calculation understandable .",
    "only the combination of both , model e , brings the k factor close to an acceptable value of 1 - 2 , leaving nevertheless still room for radiative energy loss .",
    "a very similar observation can be made for the minimum bias calculations which are compared with the experimental data in fig .",
    "[ raab ] . on the left hand side we display the results for model b , on the right hand side for model e. for a fixed coupling constant and the debye mass as the infrared regulator we need , as for central collisions , a k factor of around 12 , whereas for the model e the k factor is reduced to 1.5 - 2 .",
    "thus for central and minimum bias calculations the same k - factors have to be employed , a minimal requirement for the validity of this reaction scenario .",
    "the cronin effect changes the @xmath7 value only for momenta between 1 and 3 gev , as can be seen in fig .",
    "it is therefore without any importance for the understanding of the @xmath7 values at large @xmath0 but brings @xmath7 much closer to the data in the @xmath0 range where the @xmath9 values are large .",
    "we come now to the discussion of @xmath9 . to our knowledge",
    ", the present theories based on pqcd have not succeeded to describe _ simultaneously _ the experimental @xmath7 and @xmath9 results . as shown in [ v2a ] ,",
    "left , for model b neither the cronin effect nor an augmentation of the k factor beyond the value needed to describe @xmath7 increases @xmath9 considerably .",
    "what helps is a larger interaction time , i.e. a late freeze out .",
    "this is shown in fig.[v2a ] , right , where we compare the @xmath9 values for a hadronization at the beginning and at the end of the mixed phase . using a fixed coupling constant",
    "the k - factors remain , however , large . if one combines a running with a htl + semi - hard infrared regulator one can reproduce @xmath4 using a k - factor slightly larger than @xmath142 and assuming a late freeze out , as can be seen in fig . [ v2b ] .",
    "one could imagine that azimuthal correlations of non - photonic @xmath143 pairs created in the decay of the heavy mesons whose heavy quarks have been created together may carry information on the energy loss mechanism .",
    "many collisions with small momentum transfer may better conserve the original back to back correlations than few collisions with a large energy transfer .",
    "as displayed in fig.[fig : correl ] , this is not the case .",
    "model a and model e give about the same azimuthal correlation .",
    "this means , on the other hand , that correlations are a quite robust observable to test this reaction scenario and to confront it with other ideas like the ads - cft approach @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have found that it is possible to reduce the uncertainties inherent in present day calculations of the energy loss and of the @xmath4 distribution of heavy quarks traversing a quark gluon plasma by + a ) determining the infrared regulator by the requirement that it reproduces the energy loss calculated in the hard thermal loop + semi - hard approach + b ) using an effective infrared safe physical coupling constant which describes other data like the gluon radiation in @xmath26 annihilation and the non strange decay of @xmath27 leptons .",
    "results of calculations in which these new features are employed come close to the experimental data for @xmath1 as well as for @xmath4 . the k factor required to reproduce",
    "the data is in between 1.5 and 2 . up to",
    "now a simultaneous description of @xmath7 and @xmath9 has not been possible even with large k - factors . that the k - factor is above one may be due to radiative processes which are not included here but it may also be due to the lack of a detailed knowledge of the different physical processes involved .",
    "they include the initial distribution of charm and bottom quarks , their hadronization and the role of heavy baryons .",
    "this observation has importance far beyond the physics of heavy mesons .",
    "because the same running coupling constant and the same infrared regulator appear also in the cross section for light quarks we expect a similar energy loss for light quarks .",
    "pions show indeed a very similar @xmath1 distribution but baryons do not .",
    "the reason for this is unknown but if one follows the idea that they are formed by coalescence their formation mechanism may be rather different compared to that of heavy mesons .",
    "this conjecture is supported by their large @xmath9 values .",
    "in addition , the large collective radial flow counteracts to the individual energy loss . to clarify the hadronization mechanism of light hadrons one has probably to wait until jet like hadrons and",
    "those created by the plasma hadronization can be separated , either by measuring correlations or by extending the detection range in momentum space in future lhc experiments .",
    "the observed enhanced cross section may also be of importance for the understanding of the fast equilibration observed in entrance channel of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision where we do not have a heat bath like here but a momentum distribution given by the structure functions .",
    "there the typical momentum is , however , not far from that of the heat bath particles .",
