    "the ability of noise to produce order in systems , in particular , to induce phase transitions is well established ( see , e.g. , refs  @xcite ) .",
    "such a phase transition manifests itself in the phase - space density of the system changing its structure , for example , the number of maxima .",
    "noised - induced phase transitions are distinguished from the classical ones by the fact that their cause is not only the features of regular `` forces '' but also the action of random langevin `` forces '' . as a result ,",
    "in particular , the maxima of the distribution function describing the noise - induced phases are not necessarily related to the zero value of the regular `` forces '' .",

    "the present letter considers a certain class of such systems whose dynamics can be described by two variables @xmath1 , @xmath2 which perform a damped harmonic oscillation near the equilibrium point @xmath3 .",
    "however , the system `` cost '' of deviation from the equilibrium can differ substantially for these variables .",
    "for example , in driving a car the control over the relative velocity @xmath2 is of prime importance in comparison with the correction of the headway distance @xmath1 .",
    "so , under normal conditions a driver should eliminate the relative velocity between her car and a car ahead first and only then correct the headway . in markets",
    "the deviation from the supply - demand equilibrium reflecting in price changes also has to exhibit faster time variations than , e.g. , the production cost determined by technology capabilities . in physical systems",
    "this situation can be also met , e.g. , in pd - metal alloys charged with hydrogen where the structure relaxation exhibits non - monotonic dynamics @xcite . in these alloys hydrogen atoms and nonequilibrium vacancies",
    "form long lived complexes affecting essentially the structure relaxation .",
    "their generation and disappearance governed , in turn , by the structure evolution causes the non - monotonic dynamics which can be described in terms of dynamical traps .",
    "these observations lead to the concept of dynamical traps , a certain `` low '' dimensional region in the phase space where the main kinetic coefficients specifying the characteristic time scales of the system dynamics become sufficiently large in comparison with their values outside the trap region @xcite .",
    "a trap region is not necessarily to be bounded in all the dimensions and , in this case , it itself can not lead to the formation of new phases .",
    "moreover , the equilibrium point can be absolutely stable , so without noise there is only one phase in the system .",
    "the present letter analyzes the effect of noise on such a system and demonstrates that additive noise in a system with dynamical traps is able to give rise to new phases .",
    "it should be noted that in most models the phase transitions are caused by multiplicative noise , however , additive noise also can give rise to these phenomena @xcite .",

    "it manifests itself in that the distribution function @xmath36 changes form from a unimodal to a bimodal one .",
    "the dynamics of system  ( [ 1.4 ] ) was analyzed numerically using a high order stochastic runge - kutta method @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "the distribution function @xmath36 was calculated numerically by finding the cumulative time during which the system is located inside a given mesh on the @xmath37-plane for a path of a sufficiently long time of motion , @xmath38 .",
    "the size of mesh was chosen to be about 1% of the dimension characterizing the system location on the @xmath37-plane .",
    "( shown by level contours ) as the parameter @xmath39 decreases . in numerical calculations",
    "the values @xmath40 and @xmath41 were used .",
    "the lower window depicts only one maximum of the distribution function.[fig2 ] ]    the evolution of the distribution function @xmath36 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] in the form of the level contours dividing the variation scale into ten equal parts .",
    "the upper window corresponds to the case of @xmath15 where the trap effect is absent and the distribution function is unimodal .",
    "the third window illustrates the case when the distribution function has the well pronounced bimodal shape shown also in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . comparing the three upper windows in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] it becomes evident that there is a certain relation @xmath42 between the parameters @xmath43 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 when the system undergoes a second order phase transition which manifests itself in the change of the shape of the phase space density @xmath44 from unimodal to bimodal . in particular , for @xmath40 and @xmath41 the critical value of the parameter @xmath43 is @xmath45 as seen in the second window .     for the parameters @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath46.[fig3 ] ]",
    ", @xmath41 , and @xmath47 were used in numerical simulations in order to make the trap effect more pronounced . ]    to understand the mechanism of the noised induced phase transition observed numerically in the given system , consider a typical fragment of the system motion through the trap region for @xmath17 that is shown in fig .",
    "when it goes into the trap region @xmath48 , @xmath49 , the regular `` force '' @xmath50\\left(\\eta + \\sigma u\\right ) $ ] containing the trap factor @xmath51 $ ] and governing the regular motion becomes small .",
    "so inside this region the system dynamics becomes random due to the remaining weak langevin `` force ''",
    "@xmath52 . however , the boundaries @xmath53 ( where @xmath54 ) and @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 ) are not identical in properties with respect to the system motion . at",
    "the boundary @xmath57 the regular `` force '' leads the system inwards the trap region @xmath58 , whereas at the boundary @xmath55 it causes the system to leave the region @xmath58 . outside the trap region @xmath58 the regular `` force '' is dominant .",
    "thereby , from the standpoint of the system motion inside the region @xmath58 , the boundary @xmath57 is `` reflecting '' whereas the boundary @xmath59 is `` absorbing '' .    as a result the distribution of the residence time at different points of the region @xmath58 should be asymmetric , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](the right window ) . this asymmetry is also seen in the distribution function @xmath36 obtained numerically .",
    "its maxima are located at the points with non - zero values of the velocity , which is clearly visible in the lower window of fig .",
    "therefore , during location inside the trap region the mean velocity of the system must be positive and it tends to go away from the origin .",
    "this effect gives rise to an increase in the `` energy '' @xmath60 .",
    "outside the trap region the `` energy '' @xmath60 decreases according to expression  ( [ 1.6 ] ) .",
    "so , when the former effect becomes sufficiently strong , i.e. , the random `` force '' intensity @xmath35 exceeds a certain critical value , @xmath61 , the distribution function @xmath36 becomes bimodal .",
    "the system location with respect to the velocity @xmath2 is due to the regular `` force '' being sufficiently strong outside the trap region , so the system spends the main time inside this region .",
    "its location with respect to the coordinate @xmath1 is caused by the fact that the region where the langevin `` force '' mainly affects the system dynamics decreases in thickness as the coordinate @xmath1 increases .",
    "the latter tendency takes place because the regular `` force '' , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ 1.1b ] ) , is proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , the thickness @xmath62 of the trap region in the vicinity of the point @xmath63 can be estimated using the condition of the equality of the characteristic times , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , during which the system crosses the trap region under action of the regular `` force '' and the random langevin `` force '' .",

    "then the characteristic increase @xmath69 of the coordinate @xmath70 got by the system when crossing the trap region is estimated as @xmath71 .",
    "thereby the dynamical trap effect becomes weaker as the `` energy '' @xmath60 increases .",
    "by contrast , according to exp .",
    "( [ 1.6 ] ) the higher the `` energy '' , the stronger its dissipation caused by the regular `` force '' .",
    "the present paper has considered noise - induced phase transitions in systems with dynamical traps . by way of example , a simple oscillatory system @xmath0 is studied when the trap region is located in the vicinity of the @xmath1-axis and without noise the stationary point @xmath72 is absolutely stable . for this system",
    "as shown numerically the additive white noise can cause the phase - space density to take the bimodal shape .",
    "in contrast to the classical phase transitions the position of the new noise - induced phases is not specified by the zero - values of regular `` forces '' even approximately .",
    "the cause of the observed phase transition is the asymmetry of the residence time distribution inside the trap region .",
    "this asymmetry is due the cooperative effect of the regular `` force '' outside the trap region and the random langevin `` force '' inside it .",
    "the regular `` force '' does not change the direction when crossing the trap region , inside this region it is depressed only . as a result , for the motion inside the trap region one of its boundaries is `` reflecting '' , whereas the other is `` absorbing '' , which induces the residence time asymmetry .",
    "the latter gives rise to increase in the system `` energy '' .",
    "outside the trap region the regular `` force '' causes the `` energy '' to decrease ."
