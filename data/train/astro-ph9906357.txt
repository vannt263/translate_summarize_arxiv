    "clusters of galaxies are the largest gravitationally bound system in the universe .",

    "x - ray images of the hot , intracluster medium ( icm ) have been the most useful tool in determining cluster structures and morphology , since the gas traces the cluster gravitational potential generated by both visible and invisible matter .    under a hierarchical structure formation scenario ,",
    "substructures in the icm are formed when interaction or merging occurs between subclusters .",
    "they disappear in a typical time scale ( 2 - 3 times the sound crossing time , roettiger _ et al . _  1996 , 1997 ) of a few gyr ,",

    "a variety of morphology in clusters has been revealed by the _ einstein _ observatory",

    "for example , many clusters which have been recognized as typical relaxed systems , are now known to have complex temperature structures from _ asca _ ( honda _ et al . _",
    "this clearly indicates that it is not enough to judge the evolutionary stage of clusters only from the surface brightness distribution , but we need to examine distributions of icm temperature and metal abundance .    the cluster of galaxies abell 115 ( a115",

    "this morphology suggests that a115 is possibly in the process of a merger .",
    "the brightest galaxy in the center of the x - ray peak is associated with a radio source 3c 28 .    the strong radio source 3c 28 was observed at 4.9 ghz with the very large array ( vla ) in 1984 april ( giovannini _ et al . _",

    ", we will estimate the correct temperatures in the 3 regions in the cluster .",
    "since the psf of _ asca _ xrt has an extended tail and the integrated regions a , b , and c are not far apart , significant fraction of photons detected in each region is contaminated by those from other sky regions .",

    ", we evaluated the temperatures in three regions with @xmath50 radius to be @xmath104 kev , @xmath105 kev , and @xmath106 kev , respectively . since systematic uncertainties in the bgd level and in the response",
    "have little influence on the estimated temperatures , it is certain that a115 has a significant temperature structure along the main to subcluster path .",
    "this cluster is , therefore , probably undergoing an early phase of a subcluster merger .    when the merging scenario is assumed , a relative colliding velocity @xmath107 of the subcluster necessary to heat up the icm temperature @xmath108 from @xmath34 kev to @xmath109 kev .",
    "we further assume that the two subclusters are to cause a head - on collision and that their kinetic energies are completely converted to thermal energy .",
    "thus , necessary value of @xmath107 to result in a temperature rise of @xmath110 kev is given by , @xmath111\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath112 is the mean molecular weight ( 0.6 ) in amu , and @xmath113 is the proton mass , respectively .",
    "et al . _  ( 1983 ) calculated a velocity dispersion for 6 galaxies which were unambiguously associated with a115 based on their mapping observation in the r band , and obtained @xmath114 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the resulting @xmath115 for @xmath116 kev turns out to be @xmath117 , which is reasonable . in the cooling flow picture ,",
    "the temperature of the hot - phase gas is obtained to be @xmath60 kev , which results in a somewhat low @xmath35 value .",
    "taking , @xmath118 erg s@xmath1 and @xmath119 mpc@xmath98 , in the spherical region b with @xmath50 radius , we obtain the average gas density in this region to be @xmath120 @xmath100 .",
    "the cooling time of the icm in this region is estimated as @xmath121 } \\left ( \\frac{n_{b}}{3.8 \\times 10^{-4}\\ [ { \\rm cm}^{-3 } ] }   \\right)^{-1 } \\left ( \\frac{kt_b}{11\\ { \\rm [ kev ] } } \\right ) ^{1/2}.\\ ] ] therefore , cooling is not important in the region b. as a result , heating due to the collision of subclusters would effectively raise the icm temperature .",
    "above considerations suggest that the shock heating caused by a subcluster merger is more important than the cooling flows in creating the observed spatial variation of temperature . _",
    "asca _ and _",
    "rosat _ observations detect spatial temperature structures from several clusters which are likely to be caused by subcluster mergers .",
    "for example , it became clear with _ asca _ observations of the coma cluster that there are a low temperature region ( @xmath34 kev ) in the northeast and a high temperature one ( @xmath122 kev ) in the southwest ( honda _ et al . _",
    "this provides evidence of a merger in this cluster .",
    "many other clusters show significant temperature structures , such as a3558 ( markevitch & vikhlinin 1997 ) , triangulum australis cluster ( markevitch _ et al . _",
    "1996a ) , a2319 , a2163 , a665 ( markevitch 1996b ) , a2256 ( briel & henry 1994 , roettiger _",
    "et al . _",
    "1995 , markevitch 1996b ) , a2163 ( markevitch _ et al . _",
    "1994 , 1996c ) , and a754 ( henry & briel 1995 , henriksen & markevitch 1996 ) .",
    "we can not sufficiently constrain metal abundance and its variation in this cluster because of poor statistics .",
    "the best - fit values of abundance in the spectral analysis are 0.2 , 0.1 and 0.2 solar for the regions a , b and c , respectively .",
    "the region b shows a somewhat lower value . since the abundance distribution probably reflects the local density of galaxies ( ezawa _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) , it may be reasonable that the linking region with low galaxy density shows a low metallicity .",
    "_ asca _ observations of the cluster of galaxies a115 have revealed significant temperature variation in the icm for the first time . the hardness ratio ( h.r . )",
    "profile shows that the linking region between the two x - ray peaks has the highest temperature , which is confirmed with the spectral analysis . to investigate the origin of this temperature variation , we have looked into two possible scenarios : cooling flows in the main cluster and a shock heating due to the collision of the subcluster .",
    "the _ asca _ spectrum of the main cluster is consistent with a cooling flow model with the mass deposition rate lower than the _",
    "our upper limit on the mass - flow rate is @xmath123 yr@xmath1 . the simulated h.r .",
    "profile including the cooling flow ( @xmath73 yr@xmath1 ) can reproduce the h.r .",
    "profile around the main cluster .",
    "however , the cooling time in the center of the main cluster is estimated to be @xmath124 yr , which is comparable to the hubble time",
    ". the cooling flow may not be the dominant process causing the temperature variation in a115 .",
    "on the other hand , merger scenario can explain the high temperature region in terms of a collision between the two subclusters , as suggested from its morphology .",
    "temperatures are estimated by correcting for the contaminating flux due to the psf of the xrt as @xmath34 kev and @xmath109 kev , for subcluster centers and the linking region , respectively . observed velocity dispersion of galaxies in a115 and the icm temperature of 5 kev indicates @xmath125 to be @xmath117 , which is within a reasonable range for clusters .",
    "cooling time of the gas in the linking region is much longer than the hubble time because of the low density . based on these features ,",
    "we conclude that heating due to the collision of the subcluster is probably the major cause of the temperature variation in a115 .",
    "it is also likely that the presence of cooing flows in the main cluster makes the temperature distribution more complicated .",
    "we thank anonymous referee for pointing out the possibility of cooling flows .",
    "we would like to express our thanks to the _ asca _ team and the asca_anl , simasca , and simarf software development team for constructing excellent frameworks for the analysis .",
    "we also thank f. makino and s. uno for valuable advice on the analysis method .",
