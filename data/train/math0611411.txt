    "an important result of @xmath0-dimensional symplectic topology , proven first by taubes in @xcite using the relation between seiberg - witten and gromov invariants and then ( under minor assumptions ) by donaldson and smith in @xcite via lefschetz fibration techniques , is the existence of a symplectic representative of the ( poincar dual of the ) canonical class of a symplectic @xmath0-manifold with @xmath1 .",
    "these proofs , in general , do not provide a sufficiently explicit construction of such a representative , nor make any statement concerning uniqueness , number of components , or their genus .",
    "it is therefore a non - obvious task , given a symplectic @xmath0-manifold , to provide explicitly such a representative .",
    "an interesting case of this problem is described in @xcite ; fintushel and stern show that , for any choice of positive integers @xmath2 , there exist a ( minimal ) simply connected symplectic manifold @xmath3 whose canonical class @xmath4 is represented by an embedded symplectic surface @xmath5 with @xmath6 connected components : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a connected surface of genus @xmath9 .",
    "these manifolds are obtained through natural symplectic operations , i.e. symplectic fiber sum and symplectic rational blowdown , on simply connected elliptic surfaces without multiple fibers @xmath10 .",
    "the representative @xmath5 of ( [ rep ] ) is , in some sense , the natural result of such operations when we start with the algebraic representative of the canonical class of the elliptic surface , namely the disjoint union of @xmath11 copies of the fiber .    led by this construction , fintushel and stern ask whether , for a symplectic manifold whose canonical class admits a symplectic representative as in ( [ rep ] ) , the set of integers @xmath2 is a symplectic invariant .",
    "this question is carefully asked under the hypothesis of all @xmath12 ; without this constraint , plenty of counterexamples can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , where it is shown ( with different constructions ) that the canonical class of @xmath10 , for @xmath13 , can be symplectically represented by a connected ( non - algebraic ) torus .    in this paper",
    ", we will provide an answer , in the negative , to the aforementioned question , by showing that it is possible to exhibit a connected symplectic representative for @xmath14 for the family of manifolds constructed in @xcite . with obvious modifications ,",
    "symplectic representatives with any number of components between @xmath15 and @xmath6 can be obtained .",
    "roughly speaking , the idea behind our construction consists in  sewing together \" some ( or all ) the components of the symplectic representative of ( [ rep ] ) , while keeping the resulting representative symplectic . for the manifolds @xmath3 considered in this paper such an internal surgery",
    "is explicitly exhibited , and similar cases can be treated analogously .",
    "however , it is conceivable that a similar process exists in general , whenever a disconnected representative is available : we are not aware , at this point , of obstructions to the existence of a connected symplectic representative of the canonical class .",
    "we want to point out that , without contradiction , the result we obtain does not exclude the use of a numerical symplectic invariant related to the number of components of symplectic representatives of the canonical class ( the set of integers @xmath2 for a _ maximal number _ of components @xmath6 could be such an example ) ; it just stresses the need of accounting the various representatives .",
    "in particular it is possible that the set of integers @xmath2 determined in @xcite is a symplectic invariant of the family of manifolds therein defined .",
    "* organization of the paper : * sections 2 and 3 provide some preliminary material that will be of use in section 4 for our main construction .",
    "more precisely , in section 2 we discuss a presentation of the elliptic surfaces @xmath16 , @xmath17 , as symplectic link surgery manifolds , as the first step in identifying some natural submanifolds . in section 3",
    "we exhibit various symplectic spheres and tori in @xmath16 that will be the building blocks of our construction .",
    "section 4 contains an inductive presentation of the manifold @xmath3 , reviewing some of the steps of @xcite , that leads to the construction of the disconnected and connected symplectic representatives of @xmath14 .",
    "the construction of the manifold @xmath3 in @xcite starts by symplectic summing elliptic surfaces along the fiber @xmath18 ( obviously a symplectic submanifold ) and along a second symplectic torus @xmath19 ( a _ rim _ torus ) that arises , in the surface @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , by identifying two tori , in the exterior of the fibers @xmath22 , that become essential after the sum . in order to study this construction",
    ", we will present an elliptic surface @xmath23 as link surgery manifold ( see @xcite for the definition ) obtained from the hopf link .",
    "this presentation will help us identify some symplectic submanifolds ( spheres and tori ) in the elliptic surface @xmath23 , for @xmath21 , that we will use in our construction .",
    "consider the hopf link @xmath24 and , for future reference , denote by @xmath25 the simple closed curve , in @xmath26 , which links once @xmath27 and @xmath28 as in figure [ figh ] .     and the hopf link h - the spanning surface of @xmath27 is dashed . ]    a more suggestive presentation of the resulting three component link @xmath29 appears by considering it as the closure , with the axis originating @xmath27 , of the braid of figure [ figi ] .    .",
    "]    the exterior of the link @xmath26 contains two annuli @xmath30 and @xmath31 that are fibers of two distinct fibrations having homology class ( in @xmath32 ) equal to @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively .",
    "such annuli have boundary @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "it is useful , for future reference , to think of @xmath31 as the annulus swept by an arc in the fiber @xmath30 by the corresponding fibration . in what follows",
    ", we will consider all the knots endowed with the framing defined by their spanning disk .",
    "moreover , whenever we will make reference to meridians and longitudes , we will implicitly assume a specific choice of these curves is made .",
    "now observe that any elliptic surface @xmath23 can be presented as the link surgery manifold obtained by gluing the manifold ( with two boundary components ) @xmath37 to the exterior of the elliptic fiber of @xmath38 and @xmath39 : in fact @xmath40 , where @xmath30 is the annulus defined above ( removing an open neighborhood of the hopf link from @xmath41 gives a circle times the annulus @xmath30 , with the circle identified to the meridian to @xmath27 ) . the usual fiber sum definition of elliptic surfaces can be therefore interpreted as follows : @xmath42 where the first gluing map identifies , in the boundary @xmath43-tori , @xmath44 with @xmath45 and ( remembering that we reverse orientations ) the meridian to @xmath44 with @xmath46 , while the second gluing map identifies @xmath47 with @xmath48 and the meridian to @xmath47 with @xmath49 .",
    "after gluing , the fibers @xmath44 and @xmath47 get identified .",
    "note moreover that the smooth structure of the resulting manifold is unaffected by the choice of the diffeomorphism between the fibers of the elliptic surfaces and @xmath45 and @xmath48 ; we will later choose a particular identification .",
    "we need to keep track of the two tori of @xmath23 that are images of @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively .",
    "the first one , identified with the fiber @xmath18 of the elliptic fibration of @xmath23 , is clearly essential , but also the second one , that we denote by @xmath19 , is essential in @xmath23 , see e.g. @xcite . due to its origin",
    ", we will call it rim torus .    to analyze the symplectic submanifolds , we consider how the construction above leads to present @xmath23 as a symplectic fiber sum : perform dehn surgery along @xmath52 with coefficient @xmath53 along @xmath27 and coefficient @xmath54 along @xmath28 to get @xmath55 . denote by @xmath56 and",
    "@xmath57 the cores of the solid tori : these are , up to isotopy , standard circles of the form @xmath58 in the resulting @xmath55 .",
    "the manifold @xmath59 has a natural symplectic structure ( of the form @xmath60 , where @xmath61 represents the fibration of @xmath55 and @xmath62 is a volume form on the sphere ) .",
    "the tori @xmath63 are symplectic , framed , selfintersection zero tori and , after scaling the symplectic forms on each summand if necessary , we can write @xmath64 the symplectic form , away from the gluing locus , restricts to the symplectic form of the summands .",
    "note that the presentation of ( [ fibsa ] ) can be interpreted , from a certain viewpoint , as a glorified form of weinstein s tubular neighborhood theorem , in the sense that it provides information on the restriction of the symplectic form of @xmath23 to the submanifold @xmath65 which separates @xmath66 and @xmath67 ; application of weinstein s theorem to a fiber of @xmath38 , and then fiber sum with @xmath39 , tells that @xmath65 , up to symplectomorphism , has product symplectic structure ( where on the annulus @xmath30 we take the restriction of a symplectic form on the sphere ) .",
    "this is the same as the symplectic structure arising on the image of @xmath68 in the fiber sum of ( [ fibsa ] ) .",
    "in this section we will exploit the presentation of the elliptic surface @xmath23 of section [ linksu ] to identify some symplectically embedded spheres and tori that will be the building blocks for our ( and fintushel - stern s ) construction .",
    "we start with the tori .",
    "three symplectic , framed , selfintersection zero tori arise from the presentations of ( [ slo ] ) and ( [ fibsa ] ) .",
    "the first is the fiber @xmath18 .",
    "the second one , @xmath19 , is one of the two `` marked '' rim tori that become nontrivial in the fiber sum of @xmath39 and @xmath38 ( see section 3.1 of @xcite ) , the other one being identified with the image of @xmath69 .",
    "this essential torus is naturally lagrangian and becomes symplectic by a small perturbation of the symplectic structure , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the third one is the image of @xmath70 .",
    "their properties are summarized in the following proposition .",
    "[ tori ] consider the inclusion map @xmath71 the following holds :    the image @xmath18 of the torus @xmath45 under the inclusion above is a symplectic , framed , connected submanifold of @xmath23 .",

    "the image @xmath73 of the torus @xmath70 is a symplectic , framed , connected submanifold of @xmath23 satisfying @xmath74 = [ f ] + [ r ] \\in h_{2}(e(n+2))$ ] .",
    "moreover , the three tori above can be assumed to be disjoint .",
    "the first part of the statement clearly holds true .",
    "the non - obvious part is to prove that @xmath19 and @xmath73 are respectively lagrangian and symplectic w.r.t . the symplectic structure on @xmath23 induced by the symplectic fiber sum of ( [ fibsa ] ) .",
    "up to isotopy , we can assume that @xmath75 lies on a spanning disk of @xmath27 ( see figure [ figh ] ) ; it is therefore contained in a fiber of the fibration of @xmath55 obtained by capping off the disk fibration of @xmath76 induced by the spanning disks . as a consequence ,",
    "the symplectic structure on @xmath77 restricts trivially to @xmath72 ( its tangent space is spanned by @xmath78 and a vector tangent to the sphere ) so that the torus @xmath19 ( homologically nontrivial ) is a lagrangian submanifold of @xmath23 .",
    "this covers ( 2 ) above . for what concerns ( 3 )",
    "we note that , up to isotopy , @xmath25 is transversal to the fibration of @xmath55 ( see figure [ figi ] ) , so that the symplectic form on @xmath59 never vanishes on the torus @xmath70 . as this torus is symplectic in one summand , it will be symplectic in the fiber sum of ( [ fibsa ] ) . for what concerns the homology class ,",
    "observe that , in the homology of @xmath26 , @xmath79 = \\mbox{lk($k$,$k_{0}$)}[\\mu(k_{0 } ) ] + \\mbox{lk($k$,$k_{1}$)}[\\mu(k_{1 } ) ] = [ \\mu(k_{0 } ) ] + [ \\mu(k_{1 } ) ] \\in h_{1}(s^{3 } \\setminus \\nu h).\\ ] ] the meridian @xmath49 is homologous ( actually , isotopic ) to @xmath80 , so the relation follows at this point from the identification of @xmath50 and @xmath72 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively . the fact that these tori are disjoint follows directly from the construction .",
    "the output of the previous proposition , namely that the ( primitive ) class @xmath81 + [ r]$ ] can be represented by two symplectic submanifolds , one given by the disjoint union @xmath82 and the second by @xmath73 will be , in fact , the main tool for our construction .",
    "note that the curve @xmath25 can be interpreted as result of _ circle summing _ the meridian @xmath83 and the longitude @xmath80 . the resulting operation on the tori @xmath18 and @xmath19 , that produces the symplectic torus @xmath73 from the symplectic torus @xmath18 and the lagrangian torus @xmath19 , represents at local level the  sewing \" referred to in the introduction .",
    "having dealt with tori , we will now consider spheres . specifically , we are interested in two groups of spheres .",
    "the first group are  sections \" of elliptic nuclei , where an _ elliptic nucleus _ is the regular neighborhood of the union of a cusp fiber and a section of an elliptic fibration .",

    "next , we observe that the manifold @xmath205 contains a symplectically embedded configuration @xmath140 , inherited from a configuration in @xmath191 that intersects @xmath18 in a single point ( its @xmath206-sphere is the connected sum of @xmath160 and @xmath95 ) .",
    "this configuration is disjoint from @xmath166 ( as the @xmath108 sphere @xmath160 is disjoint from it ) and from the symplectic nucleus with fiber @xmath19 .",
    "instead it does intersect the surface @xmath174 in a single positive transverse point in the @xmath206-sphere .",
    "we blow down the configuration @xmath140 .",
    "denote by @xmath175 the resulting simply connected , symplectic manifold .",
    "we point out that the nucleus @xmath96 survives the blowdown .    the canonical class of @xmath175 is given by the image of @xmath207 under the blowdown , and we will use the previous constructions for exhibiting two symplectic representatives , one having @xmath172 connected components of genus @xmath178 , the other one connected and of genus @xmath180 .    first the disconnected representative @xmath177 ( presented in @xcite ) is obtained by the disjoin union of @xmath166 ( unaffected by the blowdown ) and a genus @xmath150 connected surface @xmath152 obtained , as in the initial step of our construction , by gluing the @xmath150 tori with hole @xmath208 to the sphere with @xmath150 holes @xmath151 .",
    "the connected representative @xmath179 , instead , is obtained by gluing to @xmath151 the surface @xmath209 .",
    "the resulting surface is clearly homologous to the previous one , and is connected , as both @xmath18 and @xmath174 intersect , in a positive transverse point , the @xmath206-sphere of @xmath140 .",
    "the genus of this surface is then easily computed . in reference to the scheme of figure [ case ] ,",
    "the two representatives above are obtained blowing down @xmath140 , of which @xmath210 is the first sphere , and connecting the surfaces hit by that sphere .",
    "this completes the proof of ( 1 ) .",
    "next , we observe that the manifold @xmath175 contains a symplectic nucleus , inherited from the one of @xmath191 , whose image we index by @xmath211 .",
    "this nucleus is disjoint , by construction , from both @xmath177 and @xmath179 .",
    "to finish our argument , we must proceed to identify a disconnected and a connected symplectic representative of the class @xmath184 $ ] , as stated in ( 2 ) . for what concerns the disconnected representative ,",
    "this is simply provided by the disjoint union of the disconnected symplectic surface @xmath177 and a copy of @xmath182 . in order to obtain the connected representative , we consider , in @xmath212 , the surface @xmath213 , composed of @xmath214 components . by blowing down , as @xmath174 , @xmath22 and @xmath73 intersect the configuration @xmath140 only in one point ( on the sphere @xmath95 ) , the class @xmath184 $ ]",
    "has a symplectic connected representative @xmath187 obtained by gluing , much as above , the genus @xmath170 surface @xmath174 with one hole , and the @xmath215 tori with hole @xmath216 to the sphere with @xmath150 holes @xmath151 .",
    "a check , using the genus formula for connected sum , or the adjunction formula , shows that the genus of the surface is the one stated .",
    "this surface intersects @xmath183 in a single positive transverse point , which is the image of the intersection point of @xmath73 and @xmath97 under the blowdown .",
