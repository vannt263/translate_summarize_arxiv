    "in our current picture of the universe , the bewildering variety of structures that we see throughout the universe all began as tiny inhomogeneities in an otherwise featureless space - time .",
    "these tiny ripples in the background are perhaps the most ancient relics left from the very early universe whose direct influence we can still observe .",
    "they appear to be present at every scale we can see , including the very largest  there are fluctuations whose spatial extent is comparable to the size of the observable universe today .    in inflation",
    ", these ripples are made through two simple ingredients : the quantum fluctuations of the metric and an expanding space - time .",
    "the metric along with the fields driving the inflationary expansion are each divided into a classical part plus a tiny quantum piece .",
    "the classical component describes a spatially uniform expanding universe .",
    "the second piece , being a quantum field , is always fluctuating ; it thereby introduces a small spatial variation into an otherwise featureless universe .",
    "the spatial extent of any one of these fluctuations does not stay fixed , since its size is stretched ever larger and larger as the universe expands . and",
    "since the rate of this expansion is _ accelerating _ during inflation ,",
    "a fluctuation is eventually stretched to a size beyond the range of any later causal process , at least while the inflationary era lasts . at that point",
    "it remains essentially frozen into the background , still passively growing as the universe continues to expand .",
    "when inflation comes to an end , the range of causal processes begins to overtake the rate at which the fluctuations are growing .",
    "once overtaken , they can then influence the evolution of the other ingredients of the universe .",
    "they effectively become the initial inhomogeneities needed to explain the origin of all the rich structure of our cosmos .    in essence then , inflation relies on the quantum fluctuations of gravity . by itself , this situation is not immediately dangerous .",
    "as long as we never consider variations of the metric on scales smaller than a planck length ( @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the newton constant ) , quantum gravity has a perfectly sensible perturbative description .",
    "however , in a time - evolving background , whether a fluctuation is larger or smaller than some fixed scale depends on _ when _ we are looking at it .",
    "a fluctuation that is larger than a planck length at one moment might have been smaller than it just a little while before .",
    "it turns out that the allowed range of fluctuations that avoid this planckian regime is quite constrained  perhaps even nonexistent . to put it a little more precisely , if we define @xmath2 to be the length of the largest causally consistent fluctuation possible at the start of inflation and @xmath3 to be the expansion rate of the universe during inflation , then the range of safe fluctuations are those whose wavelengths at the beginning of inflation lie within the range @xmath4 that is , only @xmath5 orders of magnitude .",
    "this range is actually the best possible case .",
    "it is realized only when the scale we have called @xmath2 grows until it is precisely the size of the observable universe today . since this scale is just the largest causally allowed scale when inflation begins",
    ", we could well have had a bit more inflation than this absolutely minimal amount , in which case the range of allowed wavelengths would then be narrower .",
    "in fact , if inflation lasts just @xmath6 @xmath7-folds longer than the minimal case , then this range disappears altogether and every scale whose influence we see today would have been once smaller than a planck length .",
    "this reliance of inflation on what happens at scales where we have no adequate understanding of nature constitutes the _ trans - planckian problem of inflation _",
    "thus far , most of the work on this problem has not so much attempted to resolve it as it has tried to describe how some specific new property of nature near the planck scale would appear in experiments .",
    "the best places to look for these effects are in those features of the universe that are the most directly influenced by the original pattern of the primordial fluctuations produced by inflation . in practice , these places are the cosmic microwave background and the distribution of matter over vast regions of the universe .    since the perturbations generated by inflation are due to fluctuations in the metric , they can be classified and treated separately according to their _ spatial _ symmetry properties .",
    "the most important  since their influence on the local matter density is the strongest  are the scalar perturbations .",
    "yet inflation predicts the existence of other sorts as well .",
    "the quantum fluctuations of the metric during the inflationary epoch also produce a bath of spin - two tensor fluctuations  gravity waves  throughout the universe .",
    "evidence for the scalar perturbations has been seen in many experiments , but so far the tensor perturbations have been more elusive .",
    "however , the _ ratio _ of the amplitudes of these fluctuations can have observable consequences and can thereby be constrained , even if the direct gravitational wave signal has not been measured .",
    "how this ratio enters into various inflationary predictions depends critically on what assumptions we are making at trans - planckian scales , so it is important to understand these assumptions  including those of the standard picture too  if we are making inferences about the gravity waves without having seen them directly .",
    "this article explores some of the ways potential `` trans - planckian '' effects would alter our expectations for the scalar to tensor ratio .",
    "in particular , we shall examine what happens when space - time is not perfectly flat at infinitesimal distances , but breaks some of the flat - space symmetries .",
    "such broken symmetries can substantially enhance or diminish this ratio , even while having a relatively minor effect on the scalar or tensor perturbations considered separately .",
    "we shall also discover that the amplitude of the scalar or tensor fluctuations can depend much more sensitively on the scale at which it is defined than is usually thought .",
    "trans - planckian corrections often introduce oscillations into the amplitudes , unlike the very weak power - law dependence of the standard prediction .    because the trans - planckian problem arises",
    "so naturally out of the basic ingredients of inflation , we describe the standard picture for how the primordial perturbations are generated in inflation in sec .",
    "the conditions generally assumed for an inflationary universe mean that it closely resembles de sitter space , a universe with a constant vacuum energy density .",
    "therefore , in sec .  [ desitter ]",
    "we give an example of how one of the symmetry - breaking effects in this simpler setting would alter our expectations for the size of the scalar to tensor ratio .",
    "section [ slow ] describes the general signatures of the trans - planckian symmetry - breaking effects in a genuinely slowly rolling universe , which are then discussed in a series of illustrative cases in the following section .",
    "the final section concludes with a few more general observations .",
    "let us begin by recalling how the primordial perturbations are generated in inflation .",
    "we consider a fairly simple picture , one with only gravity and a single scalar inflaton , @xmath8 , where the dynamics are described by the sum of the gravitational action @xmath9 and the action for the inflaton , @xmath10 .",
    "\\label{phiaction}\\ ] ] any cosmological constant can be implicitly included in the inflaton s potential , @xmath11 , so we have not written it explicitly in the gravitational action .    since the universe appears to be globally flat and  at least at its early stages ",
    "extremely uniform , we shall use a conformally flat metric , @xmath12 ,   \\label{metric}\\ ] ] along with tiny quantum fluctuations about this background .",
    "the rate at which the scale factor @xmath13 changes defines a natural dynamical scale associated with this geometry , @xmath14 called the hubble scale .",
    "both the metric and the inflaton are expected to undergo quantum fluctuations about classical , spatially constant , values @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the minkowski space metric .",
    "although the time - dependence in the leading part of the metric , @xmath17 , generally means that the space - time has fewer symmetries than minkowski space ( where @xmath18 ) or de sitter space ( where @xmath19 ) , the _ spatial _ symmetries remain unbroken .",
    "we can thus characterize the quantum fluctuations by how they transform with respect to this spatial symmetry ; it also ensures that different classes of fluctuations do not influence each other at leading order .",
    "the most important fluctuations phenomenologically are those which transform as scalars and as spin - two tensors under spatial rotations .",
    "the quantum fluctuations of the inflaton also transform as a scalar and therefore they can mix with the scalar component of the metric fluctuations .",
    "a completely general set of scalar fluctuations is given by @xmath20 ' \\bigr)\\ , d\\eta^2   - \\partial_i b\\ , d\\eta dx^i \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad\\quad + \\bigl ( ( \\psi+ah(b - e'))\\delta_{ij } - \\partial_i\\partial_j e \\bigr)\\ , dx^i dx^j   \\bigr ] \\quad   \\label{scalara}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the metric and @xmath21 for the inflaton .",
    "the reason for this complicated form , with its recurring appearances of @xmath22 , is that this form leaves the fields @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 unchanged when we slightly transform our coordinate system .",

    "once we have solved for this behavior , together with some assumptions about the initial states of these fields , we can describe the patterns of these perturbations through their correlation functions .",
    "the most easily observed pattern in these primordial perturbations is the two - point function , which tells how the perturbations in two different places are correlated . for the case of the scalar @xmath28 and the tensor @xmath36 fluctuations we have @xmath43 in writing the matrix elements thus",
    ", we are tacitly working in the interaction picture .",
    "there , the evolution of an operator  for example , the product of the field at two different points  is determined by the free part of the hamiltonian , while the evolution of the states is governed by its interacting part , @xmath44 . to leading order , where we neglect the influence of terms other than those already included in @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    ", we can also neglect the time - evolution of the states once we have established it at some initial time @xmath45 , @xmath46 although we have written the vacuum as @xmath47 for both the scalar and tensor modes , to be more precise we need to define the vacuum state separately for each of these fields , along with any others that might be present , @xmath48 but to keep the notation simple we shall continue to write the state as just @xmath47 .",

    "for example , if we introduce a new scale @xmath292 associated with these long - distance structures in the state , then for wavenumbers @xmath293 , the following structure would produce the leading effect @xmath294 as in the case of the trans - planckian corrections , where we introduced a wavenumber @xmath221 whose wavelength is equal to @xmath185 at the initial time @xmath45 , we can similarly define a wavenumber associated with this scale @xmath292 , @xmath295 neglecting slow - roll corrections . clearly , to avoid trans - planckian modes appearing simultaneously with these effects , we should have distinct scales , with @xmath296 . the relative size of @xmath292 to @xmath3 , however , depends on our purpose .",
    "if we would like the physics associated with these new structures to lie within the same causal horizon , then we should choose @xmath297 , which for a relatively low scale of inflation would still easily provide a sufficient range to cover the wavenumbers responsible for the fluctuations observed in the microwave background while avoiding the trans - planckian regime .",
    "alternatively , we might wish to model more general structures , even beyond the horizon @xmath298 , in much the same way as we allow for general trans - planckian structures .",
    "the goal in this instance is not to explain how they arose so much as it is to place bounds on their possible observational effects .    treating these effects perturbatively , the leading influence  for example  on the scalar power spectrum would be @xmath299 .",
    "\\label{largescale}\\ ] ] to be applicable to the suppression at long wavelengths , we would very roughly need @xmath300 which we have expressed in terms of the dimensionless ratio @xmath301 .",
    "the effect of this correction for these values , as a fraction of the standard result , is thus @xmath302 and is shown in the fig  [ suppress ]",
    ".     produced by term @xmath303 in its state , relative to the standard result and ignoring small corrections in the slowly rolling limit .",
    "the values of @xmath304 and @xmath305 chosen for this graph are those given in eq  ( [ wmapvals]).[suppress ] ]    since this effect is a relevant one with respect to the effective theory , its importance diminishes at short distances and grows at long ones . as before",
    ", the fact that the corrections are growing large at scales @xmath306 signals the breaking down of the perturbative treatment and that at such scales potentially any effect scaling as a positive power of @xmath307 will also need to be included .",
    "of course , it never makes sense to go to the absolute limit @xmath308 , since whatever lies beyond the horizon today  roughly of the order of @xmath309 @xmath310is completely inaccessible to us .",
    "the physical meaning of the new scale @xmath305 is not explained by an effective theory treatment and requires some new principle to account for it . while it could happen that @xmath305 is related to something happening during inflation ,",
    "that this scale would be precisely the right size to be important now , when the universe is so many orders of magnitude older , seems highly unlikely .",
    "a more natural interpretation is that this scale is due to some modification in how the universe evolves , which only becomes apparent on scales of the order of the horizon size .",
    "the reason , in this case , that it appears unnatural is simply that we have mapped an effect whose origin lies in a modification of the dynamics today back to a time deep within the inflationary era , which was done so that the origin and the suppression of the primordial fluctuations are treated on a common footing",
    ".    it would be good to develop this large - scale effective approach further @xcite . in the absence of any compelling models to describe how the universe evolves at very large scales , it is helpful to formulate a framework for classifying the general possible modifications that could occur .",
    "so far , the experimental constraints on the primordial power spectrum , inferred from measurements of the power spectrum of the temperature fluctuations in the microwave background , are still very weak . however , these constraints will continually be improving , beginning with the measurements by the planck satellite and then later with a variety of experiments designed to study the large scale structure through the 21 cm line for the hyperfine transition in hydrogen .",
    "usually the form for primordial perturbations used in fits of such data is that arising from inflation . yet , this spectrum should also emerge naturally , without imposing its weak power - law behavior from the beginning , if we are to have some confidence that the inflationary picture could be the correct one for our universe .",
    "in this article we have examined some of the ways that a breakdown of local lorentz - invariance at very short distances would affect the scalar to tensor ratio predicted by inflation .",
    "we chose this model since it reproduces many of the features  and some new ones as well  seen in effective state treatments of the trans - planckian problem , but in a slightly tamer setting .",
    "one of our reasons for looking specifically at @xmath140 is that it subtly influences the inferences we might make about inflation from observations . to take one example , the amplitude of the scalar fluctuations is sometimes used indirectly to constrain the inflationary scale @xmath3 .",
    "unlike the tensor fluctuations , its amplitude depends on two unknown quantities : both @xmath3 and the slow - roll parameter @xmath71 , @xmath311 if we use the standard relation , @xmath312 , derived earlier , then the empirical bound on @xmath140 together with the measured value for the amplitude @xmath313 @xcite , @xmath314 places an upper limit on the scale @xmath3 , @xmath315 from what we have seen , trans - planckian corrections might change this relation  for example , by reducing the value of @xmath140 as a factor of @xmath71 , which would allow for a higher value of @xmath3 .",
    "the simple symmetry - breaking operators that we have studied can affect @xmath140 in a variety of ways , though the most characteristic ones are those that oscillate about the standard prediction for @xmath316 ( and @xmath126 ) with an amplitude that grows as a power of scale @xmath119 .",
    "it is important again to emphasize that we have been implicitly using an effective treatment , so that when @xmath119 becomes comparable or even much larger than the trans - planckian threshold @xmath221 , the new effects are not necessarily diverging .",
    "instead , the perturbative treatment is breaking down , and all powers of @xmath317 are becoming equally important .",
    "note too that it is often thought that trans - planckian effects are suppressed by @xmath245 .",
    "certainly this happens in some classes of theories , and in some of the effects studied here , but it is not invariably so .",
    "the generic corrections that we have examined scale instead as a power of @xmath317 .",
    "thus , even if the inflationary scale is tiny compared to the scale @xmath184 , trans - planckian effects are not necessarily negligible .",
    "what is more important is how close the physically relevant @xmath119 s are to the trans - planckian threshold @xmath221 .",
    "the main lesson from this and other works on the trans - planckian problem is that without some understanding of the quantum behavior of gravity , the only safe scales @xmath119 that are relevant to our observable universe are those that lie within the range @xmath318 if the lower end corresponds to modes that still have not yet reentered the horizon , then the range available to the scales relevant to what we observe in the cosmic microwave background will be still narrower , or it may not even exist at all . these constraints do not apply just to the examples described here , where the inapplicability of the perturbative description as we approach @xmath319 is merely clearer , but to any theory of inflation .",
    "inflationary models invariably must make some assumption about how nature behaves over scales shorter than a planck length .",
    "sometimes these assumptions are guided by what is reasonable , or renormalizable , for a quantum field theory in a curved background .",
    "however , in inflation , we are speaking of the fluctuations of the background itself  and what might be reasonable there is an altogether different matter .",
