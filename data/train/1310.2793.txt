    "one of the primary goals of heavy - ion collision experiments at ultra - relativistic energies is to study the thermodynamic aspects of strongly interacting matter at high temperature and density . while at low density and high temperature , present experimental as well as lattice data seem to indicate a smooth cross over  @xcite from hadronic to a quark gluon matter , at high density and low temperature the system is expected to have a first order transition  @xcite .",
    "so the first order phase transition at high densities and low temperature should end at a critical end point ( cep ) - a second order phase transition point - as one moves towards high temperature and low density region , in the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter  @xcite .",
    "several experimental programmes have been launched to study the phase transition of strongly interacting matter . at present , relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern are providing us plethora of data . in near future the facility for",
    "anti - proton and ion research ( fair ) at gsi will also provide us a large amount of information .",
    "the low temperature and high @xmath1 region will be studied in beam energy scan ( bes ) programme of rhic and the compressed baryonic matter ( cbm ) programme at fair .",
    "those experiments would also explore the first order line of the phase diagram along with the location of the cep .",
    "the unveiling of the nature of phase transition requires a proper understanding of quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) , the theory of strong interactions .",
    "unfortunately , the non - perturbative nature of the phenomena inhibits the use of first principle qcd for the study of strongly interacting matter at extreme conditions . in this regard lattice qcd ( lqcd ) provides the most direct approach to study qcd at high temperature  @xcite .",
    "however lqcd has its own restrictions due to the discretization of space - time .",
    "furthermore , at finite chemical potential , lqcd faces the well known sign problem .",
    "in contrast , effective models  @xcite provide a simpler alternative for the study of the strongly interacting matter in the non - perturbative domain .",
    "some of these models have been quite successful in describing physics of strongly interacting matter .",
    "for example , polyakov loop extended nambu - jona - lasinio model ( pnjl ) has been used to study various aspects of physics of strongly interacting matter at high temperatures and found to reproduce the zero density lattice data quite successfully  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model @xcite has been very successful in describing the hadron yields in central heavy ion collisions from ags up to rhic energies  @xcite .    a reliable way to understand",
    "the physics of the phase transition of strongly interacting matter is to study the correlations and fluctuations of conserved charges .",
    "susceptibilities are related to fluctuations via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "a measure of the intrinsic statistical fluctuations in a system close to thermal equilibrium is provided by the corresponding susceptibilities . at finite temperature and chemical potential fluctuations of conserved charges",
    "are sensitive indicators of the transition from hadronic matter to quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "moreover , the existence of the cep can be signalled by the divergent fluctuations .",
    "for the small net baryon number , which can be met at different experiments , the transition from hadronic to qgp phase is continuous and the fluctuations are not expected to lead to any singular behaviour .",
    "computations on the lattice have been performed for many of these susceptibilities at zero chemical potentials @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that at vanishing chemical potential the susceptibilities rise rapidly around the continuous crossover transition region .",
    "since the prediction of hrg model for the system at freeze - out is in very good agreement with the experiments , it would be interesting to study the susceptibilities as well as higher moments using this model and its interacting version _",
    "i.e. _ excluded volume hadron resonance gas ( evhrg ) model  @xcite .",
    "in fact as the higher moments are expected to be more sensitive to the phase transition , any deviation of experimental observation from the model results may be taken as an indication of new phenomena .",
    "hrg model is based on the dashen , ma and bernstein theorem  @xcite which shows that a dilute system of strongly interacting matter can be described by a gas of free resonances .",
    "the attractive part of the hadron interactions is taken care of by these resonances . on the other hand , both the long range attraction as well as",
    "the short range repulsion are important for the description of strongly interacting matter  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "near critical temperature hrg calculations tends towards hagedorn divergence which may be due to the absence of repulsive interaction  @xcite .",
    "this repulsive part is incorporated through the excluded volume effects in the hrg  @xcite and is commonly known as evhrg model .",
    "evhrg equation of states have also been used for the hydrodynamical models of nucleus - nucleus collision  @xcite . in the present work we will be discussing our results of susceptibilities and correlations using evhrg model .",
    "recently fluctuations of conserved charges , using hrg model , have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite where actual experimental acceptances in terms of pseudo - rapidity and transverse momentum are considered . in ref .",
    "@xcite , higher moments of net - proton multiplicity have been studied using evhrg model .",
    "our aim in the present work is twofold .",
    "firstly we would like to have a physical understanding of the evhrg model results vis - a - vis hrg , lattice and experimental data .",
    "secondly , we would like to study the high density sector to be explored in beam energy scan at rhic and cbm experiment at fair .    here",
    "we present the temperature ( @xmath0 ) and baryonic chemical potential ( @xmath1 ) dependence of susceptibilities of different conserved quantities such as net - baryon number , net - strangeness and net - charge up to order four using evhrg model .",
    "baryon - strangeness and charge - strangeness correlation functions have been evaluated at different @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "different values of baryon and meson radii have been used to study their effect on susceptibilities and correlations .",
    "we have discussed experimental observables in the framework of hrg as well as evhrg models .",
    "the product of moments of distribution of conserved quantities are related to the ratio of different order of susceptibilities @xcite such as @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the mean , @xmath9 is the standard deviation , @xmath10 is the skewness , @xmath11 is the kurtosis of the distribution of conserved quantities and @xmath12 are the @xmath13 order susceptibilities . in general , higher order susceptibilities are more sensitive to the large correlation length and hence the critical point  @xcite .",
    "this implies that any memory of the large correlation length retained in the thermal system at freeze - out would be reflected in the behaviour of higher moments .",
    "we have studied the energy dependence of product of moments for net - proton , net - kaon and net - charge and compare our result for net - proton and net - charge with experimental data of fluctuation along with the transverse momentum and pseudo - rapidity acceptance .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "let us now discuss the interacting hrg or evhrg model .",
    "in contrast to the point like hadrons in hrg , in evhrg model , hadronic phase is modelled by a gas of interacting hadrons , where the geometrical size of the hadrons are explicitly incorporated as the excluded volume correction  @xcite to approximate the short - range repulsive hadron - hadron interaction .",
    "excluded volume corrections were first introduced in  @xcite but it was thermodynamically inconsistent . a thermodynamically consistent excluded volume correction was first proposed in  @xcite .    in evhrg model pressure can be written as @xmath37 where for @xmath16th particle the chemical potential is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the volume excluded for the @xmath16 th hadron with hard core radius @xmath40 .    in an iterative procedure one can get the total pressure .",
    "pressure @xmath41 is suppressed compared to the ideal gas pressure @xmath42 because of the smaller value of effective chemical potential .",

    "[ eq : p_new ] - [ eq : mu ] as    @xmath45    @xmath46    @xmath47    this correction scheme is thermodynamically consistent _",
    "i.e. _ eos after corrections obey the relation    @xmath48    in this work we have incorporated all the hadrons listed in the particle data book  @xcite up to mass of @xmath49 gev . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eos_mub ] we have shown @xmath50 and @xmath51 as a function of @xmath1 at fixed @xmath0 . for completeness one should also plot these quantities as a function of @xmath0 at fixed @xmath1 .",

    "@xcite and we do not repeat those here .",
    "our results show that there is almost no effect of interaction till @xmath52 gev in eos . beyond @xmath52 gev",
    "we see quite a substantial change in these quantities .",
    "the change is more pronounced at higher temperatures .",
    "one can see from this figure that at large @xmath1 the energy , entropy and number density in evhrg model are suppressed by a factor of @xmath53 , compared to hrg , if we take the radii of all the hadrons to be @xmath54 fm .",
    "this is expected as the finite radius acts as repulsive interaction between hadrons .",
    "if we increase the size of the baryons further to @xmath55 fm the suppression is even more .",
    "however the thermodynamic quantities are less sensitive to the mesonic radii as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : eos_mub ] .",
    "the plot for @xmath56 fm is almost same as that for @xmath57 fm , @xmath58 fm and is suppressed compared to @xmath59 fm .",
    "this is an expected result as the system is dominated by baryons at high @xmath1 .",
    "the difference of the evhrg model , as compared to hrg , is governed by the radius parameter .",
    "the electromagnetic charge radii of hadrons have been measured by different groups  @xcite .",
    "for example , the radii for @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are around 0.8 fm , 0.9 fm , 0.7 fm and 0.6 fm respectively .",
    "one can also define a strong interaction radii  @xcite which comes out to be around the same values . in accordance with these results ,",
    "a value of 0.8 fm for baryons and 0.62 fm for mesons were proposed earlier  @xcite . on the other hand , braun - munzinger _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite argued that a more realistic approach is to incorporate repulsive behaviour of the nn potential using hard - core radius ( @xmath64 0.3 fm ) as obtained from nucleon - nucleon scattering  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding meson radius should not exceed that of baryons .",
    "a similar hard - core radius of 0.2 - 0.3 fm has also been proposed in ref .  @xcite to explain the proton - proton scattering data .",
    "it has also been shown earlier that to justify a hydrodynamic approach to heavy ion collisions within the hadron phase the hard - core hadron radius should be @xmath65 fm in evhrg model  @xcite . in the present study we have taken an approach similar to  @xcite and have used different baryon ( @xmath66 ) and meson ( @xmath67 ) radii between 0.2 - 0.3 fm .",
    "fluctuations and correlations of conserved charges such as net electric charge , baryon number and strangeness have been considered as probes of hadronization and thermalization of the system created in nuclear collisions @xcite .",
    "fluctuation are considered to be important signatures for the existence of cep on the phase diagram as it would lead to large fluctuations in the thermodynamic quantities .",
    "moreover , fluctuations are expected to show distinctly different behaviour in a hadron resonance gas and a qgp .      derivatives of the grand canonical partition function ( @xmath68 ) with respect to chemical potential define susceptibilities which experimentally become accessible through event - by - event analysis of fluctuations in observable quantities such as baryon number , electric charge , strangeness and others .",
    "the @xmath13 order susceptibility is defined as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the chemical potential for conserved charge @xmath71 . for our purpose @xmath72 ( baryon ) ,",
    "@xmath10 ( strangeness ) and @xmath73 ( electric charge ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi^2_temp ] we have shown temperature dependence of pressure and second order susceptibilities for various conserved charges at zero chemical potentials ( @xmath74 ) . from fig .",
    "[ press_temp ] , where we plot pressure as a function of temperature , one can see that the continuum limit lattice data from  @xcite agrees within error - bar with hrg and evhrg model upto @xmath75 gev .",
    "the second order susceptibilities are found to increase rapidly with increase of temperature . near @xmath76 gev magnitude of @xmath77",
    "is almost double compared to @xmath78 and the magnitude of @xmath79 is almost zero at this temperature . as at low temperature fluctuations of a particular charge are dominated by lightest hadrons carrying that charge .",
    "the dominant contribution to @xmath79 at low temperatures comes from protons ( lightest baryon ) , while @xmath78 receives leading contribution from kaons ( lightest strange hadron ) and @xmath77 from pions ( lightest charged hadron ) .",
    "since pion is lighter compared to proton and kaon , magnitude of @xmath77 is more than that of @xmath79 and @xmath78 . in evhrg",
    "we have considered different values of @xmath66 and @xmath67 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi^2_temp ] .",
    "it can be seen that there is almost no effect of interaction till @xmath80 gev in fluctuations .",
    "the reason for this is that the effective degree of freedom does not increase much up to this temperature and therefore correction due to excluded volume is small . above @xmath80",
    "gev we find quite a substantial change in second order susceptibilities .",
    "it can be seen from this figure that at large @xmath0 , second order fluctuations are reduced by almost @xmath81 compared to the non - interacting hadrons , if we take radii of all the hadrons to be @xmath54 fm .",
    "if we increase radii of hadrons further to @xmath55 fm , the suppression is even more .",
    "we have compared our result with lqcd data  @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that up to @xmath82 gev , @xmath79 is in good agreement with lqcd if we consider radii of all hadrons to be @xmath54 fm whereas @xmath77 is in good agreement with lqcd for @xmath58 fm and @xmath57 fm .",
    "the meson radius plays an important role for @xmath78 and @xmath77 but not for @xmath79 which can be seen from the figure .",
    "this is an expected result since in @xmath78 and @xmath77 both the baryons and mesons contribute whereas in @xmath79 only baryons contribute .",
    "one should , however , note that the dependence of @xmath79 on @xmath67 is not completely negligible .",
    "we will address the issue later .    in non - interacting hrg model , under boltzmann",
    "approximation , @xmath83 and @xmath84 as only baryons with baryon number one contribute to various susceptibilities  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in case of higher order susceptibilities , electric charge and strangeness is expected to show larger values as hadrons with multiple charge / strangeness get larger weight .",
    "a similar behaviour is expected for evrhg model as well . in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi^4_temp ] we have shown variation of fourth order susceptibilities with temperature at @xmath85 .",
    "the nature of all the fourth order susceptibilities is similar to second order susceptibilities . as expected , magnitudes of fourth order susceptibilities are larger compared to that of second order susceptibilities for strangeness and electric charge .",
    "however this is not true for baryon number fluctuations .",
    "although contributions in @xmath86 are only from baryons , these quantities also depend on size of mesons as can be seen from fig .",

    "[ chi_b4_temp ] . this dependence can be understood from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : p_new ] ) and ( [ eq : mu ] ) which shows the dependence of chemical potential on hadronic radii through pressure . hence ,",
    "even for baryon number susceptibilities there may be small difference in magnitudes of susceptibilities at different @xmath67 for evhrg .",
    "we compare our result with lqcd data ( @xmath87 ) @xcite .",
    "the lqcd data for @xmath88 and @xmath89 are in good agreement with hrg model up to @xmath90 gev .",
    "whereas for @xmath91 , lqcd data is lower compared to both hrg and evhrg .",
    "it has been argued in  @xcite that for @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath43 , though lattice qcd results agree at lower temperatures , they are expected to becomes larger than those in hrg at higher temperatures due to deconfinement . on the other hand ,",
    "the difference between lattice and hrg for the higher susceptibilities may have effects due to the difference in hadronic masses .",
    "it has also been reported that the thermodynamic quantities calculated in lattice qcd may agree well with the hrg model if the masses of the hadrons in the model are tuned appropriately to take into account the discretization errors in the hadron spectrum present in the lattice calculations  @xcite . in the present study evhrg",
    "is found to show a better agreement with the lattice data in the continuum limit .",
    "correlations among different conserved charges may act as probes of the structure of qcd at finite temperature . in qgp , as baryon number as well as electric charge are carried by different flavours of quarks , a strong correlation is expected between b - q , q - s as well as b - s . on the other hand ,",
    "in the hadronic sector presence of baryons and mesons would generate an entirely different type of correlations between these quantities .",
    "hence , these correlations are expected to show changes across the phase transition which are characteristics of the changes in the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "correlation functions , @xmath94 , are defined by @xmath95 where @xmath71 and @xmath96 correspond to conserved charges _",
    "b , s , q _ and @xmath97 s are chemical potentials of corresponding conserved charges . in this section",
    "we show temperature dependence of various correlation functions at @xmath98 .",
    "we also compare our result with lqcd data  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : chi_bsq11_temp ] shows the variation of correlations between conserved charges with temperature around @xmath99 .",
    "since at very low temperature main contribution comes from pions ( baryon number as well as strange quantum number @xmath100 ) , all the correlations remain zero .",
    "the next particle to be excited is kaon and as a result @xmath101 becomes non zero around @xmath102 gev .",
    "the leading contribution to @xmath101 in the hadronic sector is due to charge kaons which has same sign for charge and strange quantum number .",
    "so it remains positive and increases with temperature .",
    "other correlations pick up non - zero values above @xmath76 gev when baryons start populating the system .",
    "@xmath103 is proportional to the product of baryon number and strange quantum number .",
    "so here most of the contribution is due to lightest baryon @xmath104 which has baryon number @xmath105 and strange quantum number @xmath106 .",
    "other contributing particles , such as , @xmath107 , @xmath108 etc . also have relative negative sign between baryon number and strange quantum number . as a result @xmath103 remains negative .",
    "this negative value increases with @xmath0 due to the increase in the population of the strange baryons .",
    "again , hrg results show sharp increase compared to those from evhrg model . due to the contribution from mesons ( mainly kaons ) in @xmath101 ,",
    "meson radius plays a dominating role and an increase in meson radius produces larger suppression in evhrg model . on the other hand",
    ", baryon radius plays a major role for both @xmath103 as well as @xmath109 .",
    "the dominant contribution in @xmath109 at low temperature is due to proton and antiproton and for both of those baryon number as well as charge carry the same sign .",
    "so the value of @xmath109 remains positive and shows a sharp increase with temperature in hrg , evhrg being suppressed due to the effect of hard core radius . in the quark sector",
    "strange quarks ( antiquarks ) carry @xmath110 ( -@xmath110 ) baryon number and the relative sign between @xmath111 and @xmath10 is always negative . as a result lattice result for @xmath103 show a similar trend as that of hrg . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath101 is always positive as charge as well as strangeness for strange quark is negative . though the lattice values at lower temperature ( @xmath112 gev ) is close to hrg and evhrg , @xmath103 as well @xmath101 for lattice increase faster than those for hrg as strange quark mass is much smaller compared to strange baryons . at high temperature quark",
    "masses decrease ( which will eventually become zero at stefan - boltzmann limit ) and lattice results would start saturating whereas hrg results would keep on increasing . as a result lattice values",
    "are suppressed compared to hrg values both for @xmath101 and @xmath103 . in the case of @xmath109 , evhrg ( @xmath67=0.2 fm and @xmath66=0.3 fm )",
    "results agree well with the lattice data for @xmath113 gev .",
    "but at higher temperatures , the weighted sum of charges of massless quarks vanishes so the lattice results would start saturating with the further increase in temperature whereas hrg results would keep on increasing similar like @xmath101 and @xmath103 .",
    "the lqcd results of charge correlations has been found to deviate from the ideal gas limit even at twice the transition temperature and the large contributions of flavour fluctuations are expected to be the cause of these deviations  @xcite . in order to analyse the experimental results , suitable ratios",
    "have been proposed to eliminate these contributions  @xcite .",
    "three ratios , namely , baryon - strangeness correlation coefficient @xmath114  @xcite , electric charge - strangeness correlation coefficient @xmath115 and baryon - electric charge correlation coefficient @xmath116 can be written as  @xcite @xmath117    figure [ fig : c_bs_qs_temp ] shows variation of @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 with temperature at @xmath85 .",

    "if all the hadronic radii are same , the interaction effect gets cancelled . on the other hand , for larger baryonic radii ,",
    "baryon population gets suppressed and @xmath114 value for evhrg becomes lower than hrg . in case of simple qgp , or more generally , for a system where the quark flavours are uncorrelated , this value will be unity .",

    "interaction effects get cancelled if radii are same for all hadrons . @xmath114 and @xmath115 are related through the equation @xmath121",

    "strongly interacting matter is expected to undergo a first order phase transition which ends at cep as one moves towards higher @xmath0 and lower @xmath1 along the phase boundary . at finite @xmath1 due to the expected stronger divergence at the phase boundary and at cep",
