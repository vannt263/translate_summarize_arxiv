    "more than 30 years after the discovery of @xcite that calcium - aluminum - rich inclusions ( cais ) from the allende meteorite contained @xmath0al ( mean lifetime @xmath2  yr ) , the origin of this short - lived radionuclide ( slr ) remains an open question .",
    "high precision mg isotopic analyses of asteroids and bulk rocks from terrestrial planets @xcite , as well as recent micrometer - scale data in chondrules @xcite , showed that @xmath0al was homogenously distributed over at least the inner part of the solar system , i.e. , over a reservoir of mass @xmath3  @xmath4 , and that no significant amount of freshly made @xmath0al was added to the protoplanetary disk after the cai formation .",
    "the maximum amount of @xmath0al that could have been synthesized by in situ particle irradiation during the short duration of cai formation ( @xmath5  yr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can account for the canonical @xmath0al/@xmath6 over a rocky reservoir of only @xmath70.1  @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "thus , the origin of this slr can not be related to the nonthermal activity of the young sun and has to be searched for in a stellar nucleosynthetic event contemporary with the formation of the solar system .",
    "an origin of slrs in an asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star has been proposed @xcite , but agb stars are not associated with star - forming regions and the probability of a chance encounter between an agb star and a star - forming molecular cloud is very low @xcite .",
    "it is more likely that the protosolar system was contaminated by material freshly ejected from a massive star , either a type ii sn ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or a wolf - rayet ( wr ) star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "massive stars have a profound influence on the surrounding molecular clouds and the process of star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite first suggested that a supernova ( sn ) responsible for injecting slrs into the presolar nebula may also have been responsible for triggering the formation of the solar system .",
    "detailed numerical simulations have shown that such simultaneous triggering and injection is possible , but the injection efficiency is lower than required @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it has been suggested that a nearby sn ( @xmath70.3  pc ) may have injected slrs into the already - formed protoplanetary disk of the solar system ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . in this scenario , it is assumed that the sun was born in a large stellar cluster containing massive stars . but this model is questionable , because ( 1 ) protoplanetary disks in the vicinity of massive stars are exposed to a rapid photoevaporation and ( 2 ) the main - sequence lifetime of even the most massive stars is too long as compared to the mean lifetime of protoplanetary disks @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite recently suggested that the sun is born in a stellar cluster of second generation , whose formation was triggered by the activity of a neighboring ob association .",
    "there are many observations of ob associations divided in spatially separated subgroups of different ages ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as observations of young stellar objects located on the border of h  ii regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and superbubbles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "adopting such an astrophysical context , we study in this letter how hot stellar debris enriched in @xmath0al could be injected into a cold protostellar nebula .",
    "we show in section  2 that @xmath0al produced by a population of massive stars in an ob association may not be delivered into molecular cores efficiently enough .",
    "we then study in section  3 a possibility already mentioned in the pioneering work of @xcite and more recently by @xcite that the presolar nebula was contaminated by @xmath0al produced by a wr star that escaped from its parent cluster .",
    "most massive stars are born in ob associations , where multiple stellar winds merge and expand to form large cavities of hot gas known as superbubbles ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the subsequent sne generally explode inside the wind - generated superbubble .",
    "the radius of a superbubble can be estimated from the standard wind bubble theory @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the time in units of myr after the onset of massive star formation ( assumed to be coeval for all stars ) , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of massive stars in the 8120  @xmath12  mass range , and @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the mean h number density in the ambient interstellar medium .",
    "the superbubble radius is generally given as a function of the stellar wind mechanical power , @xmath15 , instead of the number of massive stars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "but equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) uses the recent result of @xcite that the mean wind power per star from a coeval population of massive stars is nearly constant with time for @xmath75  myr and amounts to @xmath16@xmath17  erg  s@xmath18 .",
    "similarly , the characteristic temperature and h number density in the interior of a superbubble can be written as @xcite @xmath19        wr wind and sn ejections of @xmath0al occur at @xmath20 @xcite , when the superbubble blown by the winds from the main - sequence stars has already reached a radius of several tens of pc ( equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) ) .",
    "noteworthy , sn blast waves within a superbubble will usually become subsonic in the hot gas before they reach the supershell of swept - up interstellar material @xcite .",
    "this is true as well for winds of wr stars .",
    "thus , most nuclei synthesized in massive stars first thermalize in the hot superbubble interior .",
    "further incorporation of this material into molecular clouds and star - forming systems takes more than 10  myr @xcite , by which time the @xmath0al will have decayed .    to solve this issue",
    ", @xcite proposed that @xmath0al ejected in wr winds can be rapidly incorporated into high - speed ( @xmath71000  km  s@xmath18 ) refractory dust grains of @xmath70.010.1  @xmath21 m size , that could dynamically decouple from the shocked wind gas and imbed themselves into the surrounding molecular material . but this proposal has two shortcomings .",
    "first , wr stars are thought to be a major contributor to the galactic @xmath0al detected through its gamma - ray decay line at @xmath22  kev , and high - resolution spectroscopic observations of this emission with the _ rhessi _ and _ integral _ gamma - ray satellites have shown that the line is narrow , @xmath232  kev fwhm , consistent with the instrumental resolution ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the non - detection of doppler broadening in the galactic 1809-kev line provides an upper limit on the mean velocity of the emitting @xmath0al nuclei : @xmath24  km  s@xmath18 ( here , @xmath25 is the speed of light ) .",
    "this maximum velocity is much lower than the speed that dust grains must acquire to survive sputtering as they pass the wr wind termination shock @xcite .",
    "secondly , most grains formed in wr winds will slow down and stop in the superbubble interior before reaching the supershell . according to the classical estimate of @xcite ,",
    "the range of a grain of size @xmath26 and typical density @xmath27 g  @xmath28 is @xmath29 . in comparison ,",
    "the radial path length in a superbubble is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the h mass and @xmath32^{-2/5}$ ] @xcite .",
    "thus , grains with @xmath33 m do not reach the supershell .",
    "in fact , even much larger grains should stop in the superbubble interior , because the spitzer formula can largely overestimate the range of interstellar dust grains in hot plasmas @xcite .",
    "dense clumps of molecular gas can be engulfed by the growing superbubble , if they were not swept up by the expanding supershell ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these clumps could potentially be enriched in @xmath0al synthesized by wr stars and type ii sne in the ob association .",
    "but recent two - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations @xcite suggest that the amount of @xmath0al that could be injected into such a molecular cloud core would be too low to explain the solar system s canonical @xmath0al/@xmath34al ratio .",
    "boss et al . found that only 25@xmath35  @xmath12  of hot sn shock front material could be incorporated into a cold molecular clump .",
    "but a 1 @xmath12  presolar cloud would need to be contaminated by @xmath7@xmath36  @xmath12  of sn matter to explain the @xmath0al meteoritic abundance @xcite .",
    "although these two estimates are close , the main issue lies in the short lifetime of a small molecular cloud embedded in a hot plasma : the lifetime of a 1-@xmath12  cloud against evaporation in the @xmath3710@xmath38  k ( equation  ( [ eq2 ] ) ) superbubble interior is only @xmath7@xmath39  yr @xcite , much shorter than the duration of stellar main sequence .",
    "this scenario is therefore highly improbable .",
    "if the vast majority , if not all o - type stars ( the main - sequence progenitors of wr stars ) form in clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , nearly half of them acquire velocities exceeding the escape velocity from the cluster s potential well @xcite .",
    "these runaway stars @xcite , here we use this term for any star that has escaped from its parent cluster ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the escape velocity ranges from several km  s@xmath18 for loose and low - mass clusters to several tens of km  s@xmath18 for compact and massive ones .",
    "] can be accelerated either by dynamical interactions with other stars in the dense cores of young clusters @xcite or by the sn explosion of a companion star in a massive binary system @xcite .",
    "a star moving with a velocity @xmath40  km  s@xmath18 relative to its parent cluster leaves the associated superbubble in less than 3  myr ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq1 ] ] ) .",
    "about 20% of the o - type stars have peculiar velocities exceeding 15  km  s@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "these runaway short - living stars may have a significant probability of interacting with their parent molecular cloud complex .",
    "outside the hot gas , the star s motion is supersonic with respect to the ambient medium , which generates a bow shock @xcite .",
    "there are many observations of bow shocks created by runaway ob stars in the vicinity of young clusters and associations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the form of a bow shock is determined by the balance between the ram pressure of the stellar wind and the ram pressure of the ongoing circumstellar ( cs ) gas .",
    "the pressure equilibrium is reached in the star s direction of motion at the so - called standoff distance from the star ( @xcite ; see figure  1(b ) ) , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the stellar wind mass - loss rate in units of @xmath43  @xmath12  yr@xmath18 , @xmath44  km  s@xmath18 is the wind s terminal velocity , and @xmath45 .",
    "the interaction region between the stellar wind and the cs medium is a shell bounded by two shocks , in which the flows slow down from supersonic to subsonic velocities .",
    "one verifies that for @xmath46 the shell s mass is mainly due to the shocked cs gas .",
    "the contact surface between the shocked stellar wind and cs gas is unstable due to both the kelvin - helmholtz and rayleigh - taylor instabilities @xcite , such that we expect an efficient mixing of the wind - ejected material with the swept - up cs gas .",
    "the @xmath0al/@xmath34al ratio in the bow shock shell of a runaway wr star just prior to the sn explosion can be estimated as a function of the polar angle @xmath47 from the star s direction of motion ( see figure  1(b ) ) by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the total number of @xmath0al nuclei ejected in the wr wind , @xmath50 is a factor that takes into account the decay of @xmath0al during the duration @xmath51 of the wr phase ( @xmath521.4  myr depending on the star s mass ) , @xmath53 is the @xmath34al abundance by number in the cs medium assumed to be of solar composition @xcite , @xmath54 is the shell s radius ( figure  1(b ) ) , and @xmath55 is the shell s h column density ( @xmath56 ; see @xcite ) .",
    "we took the @xmath0al yields from the rotating stellar models of @xcite .",
    "@xmath54 and @xmath55 were calculated from the analytic solutions found by @xcite in the thin - shell approximation .",
    "the wr star parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath51 were extracted from the grids of rotating stellar models of meynet & maeder ( 2003 ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "calculated @xmath0al/@xmath34al ratios in bow shock shells of runaway wr stars are shown in figure  2 for stars of initial masses 25 , 60 , and 85  @xmath12  ( the @xmath0al yield for the 40 @xmath12  star in not listed in @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath0al/@xmath34al ratio is only weakly dependent on the star s initial mass , because both @xmath49 and the amount of swept - up cs matter ( @xmath59 ) increase with increasing stellar mass .",
    "we see that ( @xmath0al/@xmath34al)@xmath60 reaches @xmath712@xmath6110@xmath62 at @xmath63 . the isotopic ratio decreases with increasing @xmath47 , because for the same solid angle as viewed from the star , the @xmath0al atoms ejected at backward angles are mixed with a higher mass of shocked cs gas .",
    "the mass contained in the shell s forward hemisphere ( i.e. , at @xmath64 ) is nevertheless significant : it amounts to 23  @xmath12  for the 25 @xmath12  star and is between 200 and 250  @xmath12  for the three other stars .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of stellar wind bow shocks have shown that the steady - state solution of @xcite provides a good description of the time - averaged shape of the bow shock shell ; although a bow shock is neither smooth nor steady @xcite .",
    "the shell is subject to periodic oscillations in and out with respect to the equilibrium position , which has been interpreted as resulting from the nonlinear thin shell instability ( ntsi ; @xcite ) .",
    "this instability is also known to be an efficient dynamical focusing mechanism for large - scale gas stream , resulting in the buildup of dense cores .",
    "thus , hydrodynamic simulations of the ntsi have shown that the density contrast in the shell can reach 10@xmath65 to 10@xmath66 , depending on the gas cooling efficiency ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the high - density seeds thus generated are likely sites of further star formation @xcite .",
    "however , the required gravitational collapse of these dense cores is probably not possible as long as the shell is exposed to the intense photoionizing radiation from the nearby massive star ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    at the end of the wr stellar phase",
    ", the sn outburst will expel the bow shock material to large distances .",
    "about 10@xmath66 years after the explosion , radiative cooling of the shock - heated gas will become important and the sn remnant will enter the pressure - driven snowplow phase .",
    "the transition from the adiabatic to the radiative phase in sn remnants is accompanied by the development of dynamical instabilities , that can further increase the mass of pre - existing gas clumps @xcite .",
    "the timescale for collapse of a dense core embedded in a shocked gas layer is governed by the gravitational instability @xcite and reads @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the h column density of the core , @xmath69  km  s@xmath18 is the local sound speed , and @xmath70 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the @xmath0al/@xmath34al ratio in such a prestellar core can be estimated to be @xmath71 this ratio is shown in figure  3 as a function of @xmath72 .",
    "we adopted for ( @xmath0al/@xmath34al)@xmath60 and @xmath73 the values at @xmath74 ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "the error in ( @xmath0al/@xmath34al)@xmath75 shown in figure  3 is intended to account for various uncertainties in the model parameters , e.g. , in @xmath47 , @xmath49 , and @xmath76 .",
    "we see that ( @xmath0al/@xmath34al)@xmath75 increases almost linearly up to @xmath77  yr , thus reflecting that @xmath78 ( equation  ( [ eq7 ] ) ) .",
    "the predicted @xmath0al/@xmath34al ratios are consistent with the canonical value measured in cais for a large interval of @xmath72 ( as the delay for the cai formation after collapse of the presolar nebula is @xmath79 , it can safely be neglected ) . the exponential decay of ( @xmath0al/@xmath34al)@xmath75 for @xmath80  yr is due to the @xmath0al radioactivity .    inserting equations  ( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) into equation  ( [ eq8 ] ) one can see that ( @xmath0al/@xmath34al)@xmath75 scales as @xmath81 .",
    "thus , the solar system formation could have been triggered by the explosion of a runaway wr star propagating into atomic interstellar gas ( @xmath82  @xmath28 ) , but only if the star s velocity was @xmath83  km  s@xmath18 .    in the proposed scenario ,",
    "the incorporation of @xmath0al - rich stellar ejecta into interstellar gas is due to various dynamical instabilities operating in both the bow shock and the sn remnant shells .",
    "the associated turbulence is expected to homogenize the mixing at all scales , regardless of the carrier phase of @xmath0al ( gas or dust ) .",
    "this is consistent with the mg isotopic data of @xcite and @xcite , which suggest that @xmath0al was homogeneously distributed in the early solar system .",
    "@xcite showed that wr star nucleosynthesis can produce @xmath0al , @xmath84cl , and @xmath1ca at levels compatible with the meteoritic measurements , provided that the delay before the incorporation of these slrs into cais was @xmath71@xmath85  yr . but using the yields for a 60 @xmath12  star given by these authors , we obtain a @xmath84cl abundance well below the value reported in cais , as also found previously by @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the present work shows that both @xmath0al and @xmath1ca abundances in meteorites can result from the contamination of the presolar molecular core by material ejected from a runaway wr star , whose explosion as a sn triggered the formation of the solar system ."
