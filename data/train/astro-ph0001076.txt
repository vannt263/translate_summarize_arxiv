    "clusters of galaxies have been widely used as probes to extract the cosmological information . in particular , the cluster abundances including the x - ray temperature function ( xtf ) , x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) and number counts turn out to put strong constraints on the cosmological density parameter @xmath2 and the fluctuation amplitude @xmath3 @xcite . since the theoretical predictions for those purposes are usually based on the press ",
    "schechter mass function and the simple virial equilibrium model for the x - ray clusters , the reliability of the resulted constraints is heavily dependent on the validity of those assumptions in the observed x - ray clusters .",
    "in fact there are numerous realistic physical processes which would somehow invalidate the simplifying assumptions employed in the above procedure ; one - to - one correspondence between a virialized halo and an x - ray cluster , non - sphericity , substructure and merging , galaxy formation , radiative cooling , heating by the uv background and the supernova energy injection , etc .    while these can be addressed by hydrodynamical simulations in principle",
    ", the relevant simulations are quite demanding .",
    "this is why most previous studies simply check the press ",
    "mass _ function against the purely @xmath4-body simulations in cosmological volume @xcite , or focus on hydrodynamical simulations of individual clusters in a constrained volume @xcite ; most previous hydrodynamical simulations of clusters in cosmological volume , on the other hand , lacked the numerical resolution to address the above question , and/or ignored the effect of radiative cooling @xcite except for a few latest state - of - the - art simulations @xcite .    in this paper , we present results from a series of cosmological sph ( smoothed particle hydrodynamics ) simulations in cosmological volume with sufficiently high resolution .",
    "they enable us to compute the statistical properties of simulated clusters in an unbiased manner , and thus to directly address the validity of the widely used model predictions for the mass  temperature relation and the resulting xtfs .",
    "our simulation code is based on the p@xmath5m  sph algorithm , and the p@xmath5 m part of the code has been extensively used in our previous @xmath4-body simulations @xcite . all the present runs employ @xmath6 dark matter particles and the same number of gas particles .",
    "we use the spline ( s2 ) softening function for gravitational softening @xcite , and the softening length @xmath7 is set to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the comoving size of the simulation box .",
    "we set the minimum of sph smoothing length as @xmath10 , and adopt the ideal gas equation of state with an adiabatic index of @xmath11 .",
    "we consider a spatially ",
    "density cdm ( cold dark matter ) universe with the mean mass density parameter @xmath12 , cosmological constant @xmath13 , and the hubble constant in units of 100 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "the power - law index of the primordial density fluctuation is set to @xmath16 .",
    "we adopt the baryon density parameter @xmath17 @xcite and the rms density fluctuations on @xmath18 mpc scale , @xmath19 , according to the constraints from the _ cobe _ normalization and cluster abundance @xcite .",
    "the initial conditions for particle positions and velocities at @xmath20 are generated using the cosmics package @xcite .",
    "we prepare two different initial conditions for @xmath21mpc and @xmath22mpc to examine the effects of the numerical resolution . for the two different boxsizes ,",
    "we consider three cases for the icm ( intracluster medium ) thermal evolution ( table  [ tab : model ] ) ; l150a and l75a assume non - radiative evolution of the icm ( hereafter non - radiative models ) .",
    "l150c and l75c include the effect of radiative cooling ( pure cooling models ) . in l150uj and l75uj ( multiphase models ) , both radiative cooling and uv - background heating are taken into account , and an additional modification of the sph algorithm is implemented in order to avoid the artificial overcooling , following @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have l150cj which is identical to l150uj but without the uv background .",
    "while the l75c model is evolved until @xmath23 , the simulations of the remaining six models are computed up to @xmath24 .",
    "the radiative cooling and the uv - background heating take account of the photoionization of hi , hei and heii , the collisional ionization of hi , hei and heii , the recombination of hii , heii and heiii , the dielectronic recombination of heii , compton cooling and the thermal bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "the uv - background flux density @xmath25 is assumed to be parameterized as @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the lyman ",
    "limit frequency , and we adopt the redshift evolution : @xmath28 following @xcite .",
    "we use the semi - implicit scheme in integrating the thermal energy equation ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is known that sph simulations with the effect of radiative cooling produce unacceptably dense cooled clumps .",
    "while @xcite ascribed this to some missing physical processes such as heat conduction and heating from supernova explosions , @xcite and @xcite showed that this overcooling could be due to an artificial overestimate of hot gas density convolved with the nearby cold dense gas particles , and can be largely suppressed by simply decoupling the cold gas ( @xmath29k ) from the hot component .",
    "this numerical treatment can be interpreted as a phenomenological prescription for the galaxy formation . therefore following their spirit",
    ", we adopt a slightly different approach  using the jeans criterion for the cooled gas : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the smoothing length of gas particles , @xmath32 the gas density , @xmath33 the sound speed , and @xmath34 the gravitational constant . in practice , however , we made sure that the above condition is almost identical to the condition of @xmath29k adopted by @xcite",
    ". nevertheless we prefer using the jeans criterion because it is rephrased in terms of the physical process .",
    "apart from the fact that such cooled gas particles are ignored when computing the sph density of hot gas particles , all the other sph interactions are left unchanged .",
    "at each epoch , we identify gravitationally bound objects using an adaptive `` friend - of - friend '' algorithm @xcite , and select objects with more than 200 dark matter and gas particles as clusters of galaxies . specifically we use the sph gas density in assigning the local linking length with the linking parameter of @xmath35 . with this parameter ,",
    "the mass function of the selected clusters is nearly identical to the conventional `` friend - of - friend '' with the fixed linking length of @xmath36 times the mean particle separation .",
    "the virial mass @xmath37 for each cluster is defined as the total mass at the virial radius within which the averaged mass density is @xmath38 predicted from non - linear spherical collapse model , where @xmath39 is the critical density of the universe at @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the x - ray luminosity is computed on the basis of the bolometric and band limited thermal bremsstrahlung emissivity @xcite , which ignores metal line emission .",
    "we also compute the mass weighted and emission weighted temperatures , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , using @xmath43@xmath44 kev band emission . for models l150uj and l75uj , we do not include contribution of those cold particles which satisfy the criterion ( [ eq : jeans ] ) in computing @xmath45 , @xmath41 and @xmath46 , since they are not supposed to remain as a gaseous component if an appropriate star formation scheme is implemented in our simulation .    in figure",
    "[ fig : profile150 ] , we show the spherically averaged profiles of dark matter and gas densities , icm temperature , and cumulative x - ray luminosity for the most massive cluster in models l150a , l150uj and l150c .",
    "those for models l75a , l75uj and l75c are also depicted in figure  [ fig : profile75 ] .",
    "the centers of clusters are defined as the peaks of gas density .",
    "the profiles of dark matter are fairly well - approximated by the model proposed by @xcite .",
    "due to an artificial cooling catastrophe , the pure - cooling model ( l150c and l75c ) produces unacceptably high x - ray luminosity , consistent with @xcite .",
    "this artificial feature can be largely removed by decoupling the cold gas from hot component , and models l150uj and l75uj yield a fairly reasonable range of x - ray luminosities .",
    "nevertheless we do not claim that the luminosities in l150uj and l75uj are reliable ; the current modified scheme is to be interpreted as a tentative and phenomenological remedy at best and should be replaced by more realistic scheme for galaxy formation . @xcite",
    "have obtained a very similar result based on a more sophisticated treatment of galaxy formation in their simulation .",
    "they show that when both cooling and star formation are included in the simulation , cluster luminosities increase only moderately ( a factor 3 ) compared to the non - radiative case ; this amount of increase is significantly less than that in the pure - cooling case .",
    "in addition , we find that the values of the luminosities are still significantly affected by the numerical resolution (  [ subsec : tl ] ) .",
    "in figures  [ fig : timescale150 ] and [ fig : timescale75 ] , we show the spherically averaged profiles of local dynamical timescale @xmath47 , 2-body heating timescale @xmath48 @xcite and cooling timescale @xmath49 for representative clusters with 3 different mass scale for models l150uj and l75uj , respectively .",
    "each timescale is defined as @xmath50 where @xmath34 is the gravitational constant , @xmath51 the total mass density , @xmath52 the 1-dimensional velocity dispersion of dark matter particles , @xmath53 the coulomb logarithm , @xmath54 the mass of a dark matter particle , @xmath55 the mass density of dark matter , @xmath56 the number density of gas , @xmath57 the boltzmann constant and @xmath58 the cooling function .",
    "the expression for @xmath48 is given in @xcite and we set the value of the coulomb logarithm to @xmath59 as a nominal value .    for the clusters with @xmath60 in the models with @xmath61 , @xmath49 is shorter than @xmath48 , and hence the artificial 2-body heating is not effective for these clusters . on the other hand , clusters with @xmath62 have the cooling timescale comparable with the 2-body heating timescale .",
    "thus , the relatively poor clusters with @xmath62 in @xmath61 models may suffer from the artificial 2-body heating .",
    "since it is difficult to predict the possible systematic effect based on the timescale argument alone , it is most straightforward to quantify the effect by a careful comparison with the results in @xmath63 runs which are almost free from the artificial 2-body heating . in the following analysis",
    ", we use clusters with @xmath64 and @xmath65 for l150 and l75 models , respectively .",
    "table  [ tab : number ] indicates the number of those clusters which satisfy the above criteria for each model at different redshifts .",
    "it should also be noted that one should not worry the numerical 2-body heating at the central regions of clusters where @xmath66 even if @xmath67 . as noted in @xcite",
    ", those regions will experience a catastrophic cooling ; in fact , they are exactly the place where we attempt to suppress the overcooling by decoupling the cold gas particles .",
    "a conventional analytical modeling of clusters of galaxies assumes that the icm is isothermal and in hydrostatic equilibrium within the dark matter potential .",
    "then the icm temperature is predicted to be @xmath68 in terms of the cluster mass @xmath37 , where @xmath69 is the mean density of a virialized object at a formation redshift @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is a fudge factor of an order unity ; if the cluster is isothermal and its one - dimensional velocity dispersions is equal to @xmath72 , then @xmath71 is the inverse of the spectroscopic @xmath73-parameter and approximately given by @xmath74 @xcite .    since the above @xmath45@xmath37 relation is the most important ingredient in translating the press ",
    "mass _ function into the xtf , the reliability of the conventional cluster abundance crucially depends on the applicability of this relation .",
    "figure  [ fig : tm - relation ] plots the @xmath45@xmath37 relations for non - radiative and multiphase models at @xmath75 , 1 and 0 . in order to avoid the possible artificial two - body heating effect",
    ", we show the results for clusters of @xmath76 and @xmath77 in l75 and l150 models , respectively .",
    "this figure implies three major conclusions ; first , comparison of the upper and middle panels indicates that the current numerical resolution is sufficiently good and the @xmath45@xmath37 relation seems to be converged .",
    "second , the mass weighted temperature @xmath41 is well fitted to equation ( [ eq : tm - relation ] ) with @xmath78 , while the emission weighted temperature @xmath45 is systematically higher for the same @xmath37 .",
    "finally , the simulated @xmath45@xmath37 relation is almost unaffected by the phenomenological ( in the current simulation ) treatment of the thermal evolution of the icm gas , and the results of l150a and l150uj are almost identical .",
    "we also verify that the results of l150cj are almost identical to those of l150uj implying that the presence of a uv background does not affect our conclusions .",
    "this is the first successful check of the relation , made possible by the sufficiently large volume and good resolution of our simulations .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath45@xmath37 relation , the luminosity  temperature relation of x - ray clusters is not easy to predict .",
    "this is because the x - ray luminosity is proportional to the square of the gas density , and thus sensitive to the thermal evolution of the icm . a simple self - similar model , which predicts @xmath79 @xcite , is shown to be completely inconsistent with the observed relation of @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath83  @xmath45 relation of our simulated clusters ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lt - relation ] ) also exhibits the difficulty to obtain a reliable estimate of the luminosities . while it is reasonable that the results are sensitive to the icm thermal evolution , they are also affected by the numerical resolution .",
    "the cluster luminosities in @xmath84mpc models are systematically underestimated relative to those in @xmath22mpc models .",
    "since we employ the equal - mass particle in the simulations , the resolution problem would be more serious for smaller clusters .",
    "actually this explains why l150a model produces @xmath85 accidentally although this non - radiative model should result in @xmath86 .",
    "thus we conclude that the reliable estimate of the x - ray luminosities requires much higher resolution , especially for less luminous clusters , than ours in addition to the more physical implementation of the galaxy formation process . therefore",
    ", we disagree with @xcite who concluded that the effect of cooling suppresses the x - ray luminosities ; while our results do not reach convergence either , we find the opposite trend , i.e. , the luminosities increase with the cooling ( figs . [",
    "fig : profile150 ] and [ fig : lt - relation ] ) . after all , since their resolution is similar to ours , their results can not escape from the resolution problem , and it is premature to draw any conclusion on the luminosities from cosmological sph simulations .      finally we show the xtfs in non - radiative and multiphase models at redshift @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : xtf ] ) as a function of the emission and mass weighted temperatures .",
    "these should be compared with the analytical prediction on the basis of the press ",
    "schechter mass function @xcite and the @xmath45@xmath37 relation mentioned above .",
    "since we have already showed that the @xmath45@xmath37 relation agrees well with the analytical expectation , our simulated clusters in cosmological volumes can examine the statistical reliability of the analytical prediction of xtf for the first time .",
    "figure  [ fig : xtf ] implies that the analytical and numerical results agree well with each other almost independently of the icm thermal evolution model ; if we adopt @xmath89 and @xmath74 for xtfs in terms of emission- and mass - weighted temperatures , respectively .",
    "it should be also noted that since the xtfs from different numerical resolutions are nearly the same within the statistical errors , we can state that the xtfs from our simulations do not suffer from any serious numerical artifacts .",
    "these results justify the use of a simple analytical model for the cluster abundance extensively applied before @xcite .",
    "the observed xtf of local ( @xmath90 ) clusters by @xcite is also shown in figure  [ fig : xtf ] and lower by factor of 23 than the simulated ones at @xmath91 [ kev ] .",
    "on the basis of a series of the large cosmological sph simulations , we have specifically addressed the reliability of the analytical predictions on the statistical properties of x - ray clusters . in order to distinguish numerical artifacts from real physics , we performed simulations with two different numerical resolutions .",
    "our main findings are summarized as follows :    \\(i ) the inclusion of radiative cooling in the high - resolution simulations substantially change the luminosity of simulated clusters . without implementing the galaxy formation scheme ,",
    "this leads to an artificial overcooling catastrophe as demonstrated by @xcite . with a phenomenological prescription of cold gas decoupling like @xcite ,",
    "however , the overcooling is largely suppressed .",
    "nevertheless the predicted x - ray luminosities of clusters are not reliable even by one order of magnitude .",
    "\\(ii ) in contrast to the huge uncertainties on the x - ray luminosities , the temperature of simulated clusters is fairly robust both to the icm thermal evolution and to the numerical resolution , and in fact are in good agreement with the analytic predictions commonly adopted .",
    "we also showed that the emission - weighted temperature is 1.3 times higher than the mass - weighted one .",
    "\\(iii ) the analytical predictions for the x - ray temperature function translated from the press ",
    "schechter mass function are fairly accurate and reproduce the simulation results provided that the fudge factor @xmath92 is adopted in the mass - weighted ( emission - weighted ) temperature  mass relation ( [ eq : tm - relation ] ) .",
    "the xtfs simulated in the cosmology adopted in this paper are slightly higher than the observed one of local clusters by @xcite .",
    "our simulations have made statistically unbiased synthetic catalogues of clusters of galaxies in virtue of their large simulation volume and sufficient numerical resolution .",
    "thus , they can be the theoretical references which should be compared with the results from future cluster observations with x - ray satellites including _",
    "xmm _ and _ astro - e _ , and can contribute to probing cosmological parameters from observed cluster abundances in due course .",
    "additional radiative processes such as heat conduction of icm and energy feedback from supernovae explosions , which may considerably affect the physical properties of icm , must be considered as future works in order to solve the discrepancy of @xmath46@xmath93 relation .",
    "in addition , since we consider only one fairly specific cosmological model , it is necessary to perform simulations under other cosmological models .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for pointing out the importance of the two - body heating in the simulations . k.y . and",
