    "we found it useless to attempt presenting a detailed error analysis given the various approximations , but it is at least reassuring that we find a result not too far off the experimental @xmath0 meson mass , @xmath208 @xcite , despite the approximations made ( contact point interaction , bubble approximation ) , next to having used heavier bare quarks .",

    "if we , for example , set @xmath198 to its value at @xmath211 where @xmath212 equals its experimental value , we obtain @xmath213 , whose deviation from the experimental value is of the same size as the lattice result .",

    "we presented a novel calculable quark model that displays quark confinement and the right ( chiral ) properties to describe the mesonic qcd sector as bound states of unphysical ( confined ) degrees of freedom . to our knowledge , this is the first qcd model that has the concrete feature of a quark - free spectrum built in , being yet compatible with lattice quark data and able to describe mesons .",
    "it would , for example , be interesting to ( i ) consider a full - blown study of @xmath16 , a challenging task @xcite currently being undertaken , which can avoid using lattice input , ( ii ) consider other meson states , ( iii ) derive the gell - mann - oakes - renner relations for multiflavour versions with bare quark masses , etc . as our model incorporates an effective way of confining quarks simultaneously with breaking the chiral symmetry , thereby generating propagators that are consistent with lattice",
