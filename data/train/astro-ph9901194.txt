    "the likely variation of bias with redshift and among different galaxy populations at the same redshift will complicate efforts to test the gravitational instability hypothesis and to determine the mass density of the universe , but it also implies that studies of the growth of clustering can help us to understand bias and galaxy formation .",
    "the observed two  point correlation function , which is expected to be isotropic in real space when averaged over a sufficiently large volume , is distorted in redshift space by line  of  sight peculiar velocities .",
    "( for a comprehensive review , see hamilton 1998 . ) on small scales , the velocity dispersion of bound clusters of galaxies suppresses the apparent correlation function , whereas coherent motions of galaxies towards overdense regions and away from underdense regions enhance the correlation function on large scales .",
    "an analysis of the distortions allows one in principle to measure the moments of the distribution of pairwise velocity distribution .",
    "as is well known , both the first and second moments can be used to estimate the mean density of the universe , @xmath38 ( modulo the bias parameter ) .",
    "however , we will not attempt to do so here since survey volumes substantially larger than ours are required to obtain interesting results ( fisher et al .  1994 ) .",
    "our data are , nevertheless , well  suited to a measurement of the pairwise velocity dispersion of galaxies , @xmath39 .",
    "the pairwise velocity dispersion is a measure of the kinetic energy in the galaxy distribution . since @xmath39 is a pair  weighted statistic and thus very sensitive to the number and treatment of rich clusters in the survey volume , it is difficult to compare values of @xmath39 measured in different redshift surveys and with @xmath39 determined in large @xmath40body simulations in a consistent fashion .",
    "the first measurement of the pairwise velocity dispersion , @xmath41 km s@xmath12 , was obtained by davis & peebles ( 1983 ) using data from the cfa1 redshift survey .",
    "subsequent measurements , including a reanalysis of the cfa1 data by somerville , davis , & primack ( 1997 ) , have demonstrated as much as a factor of 2 variation in @xmath39 depending on the type and environment of galaxies analyzed and on the treatment of rich clusters ( e.g. , mo , jing , & brner 1993 ; zurek et al .",

    "; jing , mo , & brner 1998 ) .",
    "however , redshift surveys are becoming large enough and analysis techniques sophisticated enough to begin to measure reliable values of @xmath39 .",
    "the large volume of our combined surveys , @xmath42 mpc@xmath30 ( comoving , @xmath5 ) , will enable us to make a measurement of @xmath39 at intermediate redshift for which the error due to cosmic variance will be @xmath43% ( marzke et al .",

    "we use @xmath5 in the main discussion and for the figures except where explicitly noted .",
    "our analysis is based on data we have obtained with the 176fiber norris spectrograph ( hamilton et al .  1993 ) on the palomar 5 m telescope .",

    "the norris spectrograph is designed for redshift surveys of faint galaxies .",
    "its fibers are only 2 m long in order to minimize light losses due to absorption in the fibers , and the fiber entrance aperture is only 1.6 arcsec ( fwhm ) , which maximizes the contrast of a @xmath52 mag object against the palomar sky .",
    "norris is equipped with a sensitive , thinned , backside  illuminated , anti  reflection  coated site 2048@xmath53 ccd . due to the large plate scale ( 2.55 arcsec / mm ) of the cassegrain focus of the 5 m telescope , the fibers can be placed within 16 arcsec of each other , allowing comoving scales as small as @xmath54 mpc to be probed at @xmath26 .",

    "( for a more extensive discussion of our spectral classification and computation of absolute magnitudes , see small , sargent , & hamilton [ 1997b ] . )    the norris data suffer from both magnitude and spatial selection effects .",
    "we assume that the total selection function is separable : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the probability that a galaxy with magnitude @xmath62 is sufficiently well detected to yield a secure redshift and @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are celestial coordinates , is the geometrical modulation of @xmath61 ( c.f .",

    "the mean value of @xmath66 is approximately one .",
    "we could also account for the fraction of objects that are classified as galaxies in the original catalog from which we select objects but which turn out to be misclassified stars .",
    "however , since this fraction is small ( @xmath67% ) and does not vary spatially , we have chosen to ignore it .",
    "the precise forms of @xmath68 and @xmath66 for the two surveys are described in the following two subsections .",
    "the survey of the corona borealis supercluster has already been described in the literature ( small , sargent , & hamilton 1997a ) , and so we will only briefly review the salient points here .",
    "the core of the supercluster covers a @xmath69 region of the sky and consists of seven rich abell clusters .",
    "since the field of view of the norris spectrograph is 20  in diameter , we planned to observe 36 fields selected from the poss - ii survey ( reid et al .",
    "1991 ) and arranged in a rectangular grid with a grid spacing of 1 , with the precise position of a particular field adjusted to maximize the number of fibers placed on galaxies .",
    "we mainly tried to avoid the cores of the seven abell clusters since redshifts for many galaxies in the cores are available from the literature .",
    "we successfully observed 23 of the program fields and 9 additional fields along the ridge of galaxies between abell 2061 and abell 2067 , yielding redshifts for 1491 extragalactic objects .",
    "our first 17 fields were observed when no large ",
    "format @xmath70 ccd was available at palomar , limiting us to using only one - half of the fibers and leading to geometrical selection effects for which we are not able to correct .",
    "we have therefore restricted the analysis presented here to the 981 @xmath71 mag , @xmath72 galaxies successfully observed with the large ",
    "format @xmath70 ccd available at palomar since 1994 .",
    "excluding the data from the first 17 fields observed only reduces the number of galaxies at @xmath73 by 23% .",
    "the locations on the plane of the sky of all the galaxies in the corona borealis survey are shown in figure [ figures : cb_on_sky ] .",
    "galaxies with @xmath74 are marked with filled circles while galaxies with @xmath75 are marked with unfilled circles .",
    "the redshift distribution for all galaxies with @xmath1 mag is shown in figure [ figures : cb_z ] .",
    "the prominent features at @xmath46 and @xmath76 are the two superclusters in the field ; see small et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for a detailed discussion of the properties of the superclusters . in our analysis of the field galaxy luminosity function in the corona borealis survey ( small et al.1997b )",
    ", we found that the region from @xmath77 , with the superclusters _ excluded _ , was overdense by 21% relative to other high  galactic  latitude fields .",
    "while this overdensity is not an exceptional fluctuation , we have conservatively chosen to avoid the complications of analyzing such a large overdense region and have limited our study to galaxies with @xmath2 .",
    "the galaxy number density over this redshift range is consistent with the number density found in the cfrs ( lilly et al .",
    "1995b ) and cnocii ( lin et al .",
    "1998 ) surveys .",
    "the corona borealis survey is not magnitude  limited . in figure",
    "[ figures : cb_mag ] , we plot @xmath61 , the ratio of the number of galaxies with measured redshifts to the total number of galaxies in the survey fields as a function of magnitude . for @xmath78 ,",
    "the ratio @xmath61 is nearly constant , but below unity because of sparse sampling .",
    "it then falls rather steeply to fainter magnitudes due both to the fiber assignment algorithm and to the increasing difficulty of measuring redshifts for fainter objects . since the light from",
    "very bright galaxies can bleed into neighboring fibers , we have made a modest effort to avoid galaxies brighter than @xmath79 mag , which accounts for the decline in the fraction of galaxies observed at the brightest magnitudes .",
    "we describe how we correct for magnitude incompleteness in  3 .",
    "our sampling of the corona borealis field on the plane of the sky varies dramatically .",
    "in particular , much of the @xmath80 has not been surveyed at all .",
    "we quantify the angular selection effects by dividing the entire survey area into @xmath81 9 sq .",
    "arcmin cells and , for each cell , computing the ratio of the number of galaxies with magnitudes @xmath82 with measured redshifts to the total number of catalog galaxies with magnitudes @xmath83 .",
    "the 9 sq .",
    "arcmin cells are as small as we can make them while still maintaining a reasonable number of galaxies in each cell .",
    "the geometrical selection function , @xmath66 , is this ratio normalized by the fraction ( 16% ) of @xmath84 magnitude galaxies in the survey fields for which we have obtained reliable redshifts .",
    "the mean value of @xmath66 averaged over the survey fields is 0.99 .",
    "we display the map of @xmath66 , gaussian  smoothed with @xmath85  for clarity , in figure [ figures : cb_sp_sel ] .",
    "the gray scale ranges linearly from 0 .",
    "to 2.0 , and the contours are drawn at 0.5 , 1.0 , and 1.5 .",
    "the most prominent feature of the map is the radial dependence of the sampling within a given norris field .",
    "the decline in sensitivity at the edges of the field is due to a combination of effects : mild vignetting , curvature of the focal plane which makes fibers at the edge slightly out of focus , and a bias against pairs with large angular separation introduced by the fiber assignment software ( see small et al .",
    "1997a ) .    since the survey area has been divided into @xmath86 cells , this procedure does not correct for spatial selection effects on scales smaller than 3 .",
    "the fibers can not be placed within 16  of each other , and so we expect a substantial deficit of observed pairs on scales smaller than @xmath87 arcsec . this deficit is illustrated in figure [ figures : cb_pairs ] in which we plot , as a function of pair separation , the ratio of the number of observed pairs of galaxies to the number of pairs , averaged over 50 realizations , of galaxies selected from the survey fields according to the total selection function ( i.e. , magnitude selection times geometrical selection ) .",
    "there is a strong bias against observed pairs with separations smaller than 100 .",
    "when computing correlation functions , we use the ratio shown in figure [ figures : cb_pairs ] to correct the observed pair counts for these missing small  angular  separation pairs .",
    "( this correction is described in more detail in  3 . )",
    "the plot in figure [ figures : cb_pairs ] also reveals a significant deficit of pairs with angular separations ranging from 13  to 33 , scales comparable 20field  of  view of the norris spectrograph .",
    "since there are so few observed pairs with separations on this scale , we can not accurately correct for missing pairs on this scale and simply leave a gap in the correlation function at the physical scale corresponding to this angular scale ( @xmath88 mpc at @xmath26 ) .",
    "we do not attempt to measure correlations on scales larger than 30  and therefore ignore the imperfections in our model of the geometrical selection effects on large scales .",
    "the data from our abell 104 survey are similar in most respects to the data obtained in our corona borealis survey .",
    "we have surveyed 1 sq.deg .  centered on abell 104 , plus",
    "four outlying fields northeast , northwest , southeast , and southwest of the center by @xmath89 .",
    "we have measured spectra for 1330 galaxies in the survey , 207 of which lie in abell 104 at @xmath49 .",
    "we have 558 galaxies with redshifts @xmath2 and magnitudes @xmath84 .",
    "the locations on the sky of these 558 galaxies ( filled circles ) , along with the locations of the @xmath71 mag galaxies with @xmath90 ( unfilled circles ) , are shown in figure [ figures : a104_on_sky ] .",
    "the survey will be described in detail in small , sargent , & hamilton ( 1999 ) .    as with the corona borealis survey , the a104 survey is not magnitude  limited . a plot of @xmath61 , the ratio of the number of galaxies with measured redshifts to the total number of galaxies in the survey fields as a function of magnitude , is shown in figure [ figures : a104_mag ] .",
    "the a104 field is less sparsely sampled than the corona borealis field .",
    "the magnitude selection function declines slowly from @xmath91 mag to @xmath92 mag , beyond which the selection function drops sharply .",
    "the a104 survey is modestly deeper than the corona borealis survey , principally because the experience gained during the corona borealis survey was successfully applied to the a104 survey .",
    "the increased depth of the a104 survey is borne out in the redshift distribution plotted in figure [ figures : a104_z ] .    the a104 survey , like the corona borealis survey , suffers from uneven spatial sampling .",
    "we construct a map of the spatial selection function @xmath66 for galaxies with @xmath82 in the same manner as for the corona borealis survey .",
    "we divide the entire survey region into @xmath93 square cells , each of which has an area of 9 sq . arcmin .",
    "for each cell , the angular selection function is the number of galaxies with measured redshifts with magnitude @xmath82 divided by the total number of galaxies with magnitude @xmath82 , normalized by the fraction ( 22% ) of galaxies in the entire survey for which we have obtained reliable redshifts .",
    "the mean value of @xmath66 is 0.98 .",
    "this map is shown in figure [ figures : a104_sp_sel ] .",
    "the gray scale ranges linearly from 0 . to 2 . , and the contours are drawn at 0.5 , 1.0 , and 1.5 .",
    "the spatial selection function is higher in the central field because the central field was observed multiple times .",
    "the multiple observations of the central field also increase the number of close pairs , although a significant bias against close pairs remains . in figure",
    "[ figures : a104_pairs ] , we plot , as a function of angular separation , the ratio of the number of pairs of galaxies successfully observed to the number of pairs , averaged over 50 realizations , of galaxies in the parent catalog selected according to the combined magnitude and spatial selection functions . due to the overlapping norris fields in the a104 survey ,",
    "the sampling of pairs as a function of angular separation is noticeably more uniform than for the corona borealis survey . in particular",
    ", there is no deficit of pairs on scales comparable to the size of the norris field  of  view .",
    "of course , as for the corona borealis survey , the spatial selection function can only correct for errors on angular scales larger than the @xmath86 cell size in which the selection function was computed .",
    "thus , there is still a large error on scales smaller than 180 , in the sense that close pairs are excluded from the redshift survey , which is shown in the inset in figure [ figures : a104_pairs ] .",
    "when computing correlation functions , we use an additional selection function to correct the smallest angular scales .",
    "this additional function is simply the ratio of pair separations for separations less than 200 , multiplied by 1.04 to bring the flat part of the function to a mean value of 1 .",
    "space maps of the spatial distribution of galaxies are distorted by the peculiar motions of galaxies because the measured redshift of a galaxy is the sum of the hubble motion of the galaxy plus the line  of  sight peculiar velocity .",
    "the most prominent signatures of redshift  space distortions are the `` fingers of god '' seen in redshift surveys of rich clusters of galaxies , in which the large velocity dispersion of a cluster spreads out the cluster galaxies along the line  of  sight in redshift space . on large scales , coherent infall into overdense regions and outflow from underdense regions",
    "enhance the correlation function .",
    "since the velocities on large scales can be simply related to the mean mass density of the universe @xmath38 with linear theory , an analysis of redshift space distortions can in principle yield an estimate of @xmath38 ( sargent & turner 1977 , fisher et al .",
    "1994 , hamilton 1998 ) .",
    "the distribution of galaxies on the plane of the sky is not , however , distorted by peculiar velocities .",
    "thus , correlation functions , which one assumes are isotropic in real space when averaged over sufficiently large volumes , are anisotropic in redshift space .",
    "it is , therefore , useful to compute correlation functions as functions of separations along the line  of  sight ( @xmath95 ) and perpendicular to the line  of  sight ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "the two - point correlation function @xmath97 is defined implicitly by the following equation for the joint probability @xmath98 of finding a galaxy in each of two volume elements @xmath99 separated by @xmath96 and @xmath95 , @xmath100dv_1dv_2,\\ ] ] where @xmath101 is the mean galaxy density . in order to compute @xmath97",
    ", we construct a catalog of randomly distributed points with the same selection function as the real data .",
    "we estimate @xmath97 using the estimator derived , tested , and recommended by landy & szalay ( 1993 ) : @xmath102 where dd@xmath103 , rr@xmath103 , and dr@xmath103 are the number of data  data , random  random , and data  random pairs , respectively , with separations @xmath96 and @xmath95 .",
    "there are three important virtues of landy & szalay s estimator : it is affected only in second order by density fluctuations on the scale of the survey ; it does not require an independent measurement of the mean density of the survey ; and its errors are very nearly poissonian for an unclustered population .",
    "the data  data pair counts are corrected for missing pairs on small scales using the curves shown in figures [ figures : cb_pairs ] and [ figures : a104_pairs ] . as expected and demonstrated below , the correction works very well for the _ angular _ correlation function . in applying this correction to the spatial correlation function , we simply assume , since the bias against close separation pairs is primarily due to limits on how closely fibers can be placed in the focal plane of the spectrograph , that the redshift distribution of unobserved close pairs is identical to that of observed close pairs .    in order to compute the real space correlation function @xmath17 , we follow davis & peebles ( 1983 ) , and many subsequent workers , by projecting @xmath97 onto the @xmath96 axis .",
    "the projection @xmath104 depends only on the real space correlation function : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the line  of  sight separation in real space .",
    "the integrand in the second expression for @xmath104 is the correlation function in real space .",
    "if we assume that @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the correlation length and @xmath109 is the power  law index , the integral for @xmath104 can be evaluated analytically to give : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the standard gamma function . by fitting a power law to @xmath104 , we can determine the correlation length @xmath108 and power law index @xmath109 of the real space correlation function .",
    "we calculate the error in @xmath97 using the standard technique of bootstrap resampling the data ( ling , frenk , & barrow 1986 ) .",
    "we perform 50 bootstrap resamples with replacement and take the error bars on @xmath97 to be the standard deviation of the bootstrap estimates .",
    "the bootstrap error bars are typically 75100% larger than error bars derived from the standard poisson estimate , @xmath112 .",
    "the construction of the random catalog is complicated by our magnitude selection effects and our uneven spatial sampling . as noted above",
    ", our sample of galaxies is not magnitude - limited .",
    "in addition , it is important that the color distribution of the galaxies in the random catalog matches the observed color distribution .",
    "we have , therefore , selected the redshifts of galaxies in the random catalog not from the probability distribution @xmath113 that an object at redshift @xmath114 has an absolute magnitude @xmath115 , which would be appropriate for a magnitude  limited sample , but rather from the distribution @xmath116 that a galaxy with an apparent magnitude @xmath62 and spectral type @xmath117 ( rounded to e , sbc , scd , or i m ; see  2 ) has a redshift @xmath114 ( suggested by d. hogg , personal communication ) : @xmath118 here , @xmath119 is the luminosity function , @xmath120 is the absolute magnitude of a galaxy of spectral type @xmath117 such that it would have apparent magnitude @xmath62 at redshift @xmath114 , and @xmath121 is the comoving relativistic volume element . for each galaxy in the survey",
    ", we generate 100 galaxies in the random catalog with the same apparent magnitude and spectral type as the given galaxy , with redshifts drawn according to equation [ equations : p_z_m ] , and with celestial coordinates distributed according to the spatial sampling maps presented in  2 .",
    "thus , the distribution of apparent magnitudes and spectral types of the galaxies in the random catalog is identical to that of the real survey data , but the locations are random .",
    "note that when analyzing a subset of the survey data selected by spectral type or intrinsic luminosity , it is trivial with this method to ensure that the random catalog is generated with exactly the same selection function .",
    "we use a schechter ( 1976 ) function to describe the luminosity function of our survey . for @xmath2 ,",
    "we use schechter parameters @xmath122 and @xmath123 ( @xmath5 ) in the @xmath124band , consistent with the results from the cnocii survey ( lin et al .  1998 ) and our own survey ( small et al .",

    "low redshift data come from the combined cfa2/ssrs2 survey ( marzke et al.1995 ) , the stromlo / apm survey ( loveday et al .",
    "1995 ) , the las campanas redshift survey ( jing et al .",
    "1998 ) , and the infrared  selected 1.2 jy iras survey ( fisher et al .",
    "at high redshifts , we plot the measurements presented here , the @xmath250 point from the cnoci survey ( shepherd et al .",
    "1997 ) ; the @xmath251 , @xmath252 , @xmath253 , and @xmath254 points from the cnocii survey ( carlberg et al.1999 ) ; the @xmath255 , @xmath256 , and @xmath257 points from the cfrs survey ( le fvre et al .",
    "1996 ) ; and the @xmath28 estimate obtained by postman et al .",
    "( 1998 ) by deprojecting their wide ",
    "field @xmath258-band imaging data .",
    "for ease of comparison with previous work , the points plotted here are for @xmath150 ( or @xmath259 ) .",
    "note that the three solid squares marking our measurements for the abell 104 field are not independent .",
    "the low redshift point is for galaxies in the redshift interval @xmath260 , the high redshift point is for galaxies in the redshift interval @xmath9 , and the point in between is for galaxies in the combined redshift interval @xmath2 .",
    "although there is a wide dispersion in the measurement of @xmath108 at all redshifts , there is a strong indication that the comoving correlation length declines slowly beyond @xmath261 .",
    "the pioneering cfrs survey suggests the most dramatic decline in the correlation length .",
    "the cfrs results , however , should be interpreted with caution since the survey covered such a small volume and includes mainly sub@xmath172 galaxies at @xmath14 .",
    "the cnoci measurement is also low , but it too may suffer from cosmic variance caused by analyzing only a small volume . the results from the larger volumes surveyed by cnocii , postman et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and ourselves are all consistently above the cfrs and cnoci points and suggest a more modest decline in the comoving correlation length with redshift .    as an illustration ,",
    "we also plot in figure [ figures : r0_evol ] estimates of the comoving correlation length for dark matter halos with masses greater than @xmath262 m@xmath263 from the @xmath40body simulations presented in ma ( 1999 ) .",
    "results for three cosmological models are shown : the standard @xmath264 cold dark matter model with @xmath265 and two low - density models with a cosmological constant , @xmath266 and ( 0.3 , 0.7 ) , normalized to _ cobe_. for each model , we have only plotted the correlation length at one redshift because the variation of the comoving correlation length is less than 10% over the entire redshift range from @xmath267 to @xmath268 .",
    "the correlation length at @xmath269 has a clear dependence on the matter density parameter @xmath270 .",
    "the models with lower @xmath270 have larger @xmath108 because the universe is dominated by the vacuum energy at this low redshift and gravitational clustering has effectively stopped .",
    "however , it should be remembered that the correlation length depends on the halo population , and there may exist a nontrivial relationship between the dark matter halo distribution in simulations and the observed galaxy distribution .",
    "recent work has proposed ways to make connections between halo and galaxy distributions by combining semi  analytic models of galaxy evolution with traditional @xmath40-body simulations ( kauffmann et al .  1999 , 1998 ; baugh et al .",
    "1998 ) . while the uncertainties associated with these semi  analytic models are still large , the models can produce plausible galaxy evolution histories and can match many observed properties of the evolving galaxy population from @xmath37 to the present .",
    "the details of the predicted clustering evolution depend on a large number of factors , including the cosmological model , the nature of the dark matter , the type of galaxies observed , the waveband of the observations , and so on . the sensitive dependence of correlation functions on sample selection obviates  for the time being  the use of measurements of the evolution of clustering to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "however , as emphasized by kauffmann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , this same sensitivity makes studies of clustering evolution a powerful tool for constraining models of galaxy formation and evolution .    given the uncertainties in the observations and model predictions , it appears premature to attempt to draw any firm conclusions about cosmological parameters or galaxy evolution from the data presented in figure [ figures : r0_evol ] .",
    "it is nonetheless worthwhile to highlight the general agreement between the data and the predictions of hierarchical structure formation models .",
    "while the clustering of the underlying matter distribution declines monotonically with increasing redshift , the comoving correlation length of galaxies is predicted to decline modestly or , in fact , remain flat until @xmath271 and then rise at very high redshifts as the only galaxies bright enough to be observable with current instrumentation become very highly biased ( kauffmann et al .",
    "1998 , baugh et al .  1998 ) .",
    "the data collected in figure [ figures : r0_evol ] , excluding the unusually low results from the cfrs and cnoci surveys , show only a @xmath272 mpc decline in comoving correlation length to @xmath273 . at high redshifts beyond the redshift range plotted in figure [ figures : r0_evol ] , the correlation length of @xmath37 lyman  break galaxies",
    "is roughly comparable to that of local @xmath172 galaxies ( steidel et al .",
    "1998 , giavalisco et al .",
    "1998 , adelberger et al .  1998 ) .",
    "thus , the observed evolution of the galaxy correlation function broadly matches that expected in hierarchical structure formation models .",
    "furthermore , the observed variation of the correlation length with galaxy population at a given redshift is in accord with expectations from semi  analytic models .",
    "for example , kauffmann et al.s models naturally explain the weaker clustering of blue and less luminous galaxies relative to red and more luminous galaxies as reflections of the typical masses of the dark halos in which different galaxies reside ( i.e. , blue and less luminous galaxies reside in less massive , and therefore less biased , halos than red and more luminous galaxies ) . as both the observations and the theoretical models",
    "are refined , it is clear that studies of the evolution of galaxy clustering will provide valuable insights into galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "as discussed in  5 above , the pairwise velocity dispersion @xmath39 is a more difficult quantity to measure reliably than the spatial two  point correlation function @xmath45 .",
    "our measurement of @xmath274 km s@xmath12 at @xmath275 indicates a @xmath13% decrease from the typical values measured locally , although our value is comparable to the pairwise velocity dispersion of local samples selected in the infrared or with early  type galaxies or clusters excluded .",
    "preliminary results from cnocii are consistent with our finding .",
    "the map of the large  scale galaxy distribution out to @xmath28 in the abell 104 field presented in figures [ figures : a104_fof_ra ] and [ figures : a104_fof_dec ] exhibits a striking structure in which the galaxies lie mainly in thin sheets surrounding large ( @xmath276 mpc ) , nearly empty voids , similar to the pattern of structure seen in local surveys .",
    "using a friends  of  friends analysis , we found that only @xmath277% of galaxies in the survey did not lie in a structure with an overdensity of at least @xmath241 .",
    "we have also performed a _",
    "real_space friends  of  friends analysis of the halos formed in the @xmath40body simulations described in the previous section .",
    "although the precise numbers depend very sensitively on the linking parameter chosen and the minimum mass of the selected halos , the results from the @xmath40body simulations are compatible with the observations .",
    "for example , the percentage of halos with masses greater than @xmath278 m@xmath263 which are part of larger structures with overdensities @xmath16 ( @xmath279 ) is approximately 80% for the standard cold dark matter model and 70% for the @xmath280 model . as an illustration of the sensitivity of these numbers to the chosen parameters",
    ", we note that 100% of the @xmath278 m@xmath263 and greater halos are linked together in the low ",
    "density model when the linking parameter is raised to @xmath281 .",
    "the pattern of sheets and shells visible in the galaxy distribution , if fortuitously aligned along the line of sight , could be responsible for the apparent @xmath282 mpc periodicity observed by broadhurst et al .",
    "( 1990 ) in their pencil  beam survey of the north and south galactic poles .",
    "this pattern is probably also reflected in the prominent redshift ",
    "space spikes observed by cohen et al .  ( 1996 ) in their k  band  selected redshift survey .",
    "however , as emphasized by kaiser & peacock ( 1991 ) , the appearance of periodic structures in pencil ",
    "beam redshifts surveys is exaggerated by projection of small  scale power in the three  dimensional power spectrum to large scales in the one  dimensional power spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , there remain credible detections of excess power on @xmath283 mpc scales , particularly in the two  dimensional power spectrum of galaxies in the las campanas redshift survey ( landy et al .",
    "1996 ) and in the distibution of rich clusters of galaxies ( einasto 1998 ) .",
    "we are , therefore , continuing our survey in the corona borealis region in order to be able to compute the three  dimensional power spectrum at @xmath284 and to delineate structure on _ transverse _ scales of @xmath285 mpc at @xmath273 .",
    "additional data will , of course , also allow improved estimates of the intermediate ",
    "redshift correlation function and pairwise velocity dispersion .",
    "we are grateful to the kenneth t. and eileen l. norris foundation for their generous grant for construction of the norris spectrograph .",
