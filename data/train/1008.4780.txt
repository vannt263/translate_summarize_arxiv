    "since their discovery , halo nuclei have been the subject of many theoretical and experimental investigations @xcite .",
    "these light exotic nuclei exhibit a peculiar quantal structure due to their low separation energy of one or two nucleons .",
    "thanks to this weak binding , these valence nucleons have a significant probability of presence at large distances and form a sort of halo around the core of the nucleus @xcite . since they appear at the edge of the valley of stability , halo nuclei are short - lived and can not be studied through usual spectroscopic techniques .",
    "one usually resorts to reactions to infer information about their structure .",
    "elastic scattering , being a peripheral process , is sensitive mostly to the tail of the wave functions of the colliding nuclei",
    ". it may thus be an interesting probe of these exotic nuclei .",
    "moreover , elastic scattering is likely to be affected by reactions , which , like breakup , are significantly enhanced by the weak binding of these nuclei . for that reason , efforts have been made to investigate the effects of the halo upon elastic scattering around the coulomb barrier @xcite .",
    "these works have shown a significant reduction of the elastic - scattering cross section at large angles compared to stable nuclei .",
    "this reduction is interpreted as a loss of flux from the elastic channel towards reaction channels , like breakup or transfer .",
    "angular distributions for both elastic scattering and breakup are also studied at intermediate energies @xcite . in , such observables have been measured to evaluate the e2 contribution to the coulomb breakup of b , which is of astrophysical interest . in , angular distributions for the elastic scattering and breakup of",
    "be have been measured to investigate the structure of this one - neutron halo nucleus .",
    "both experiments have been successfully reproduced within the dynamical eikonal approximation ( dea ) @xcite , which coherently describes both elastic scattering and breakup .",
    "interestingly , the theoretical analysis of the b coulomb breakup has shown significant nuclear - coulomb interferences that may convey information about the structure of the projectile and/or its interaction with the target @xcite . to better understand these features and the interplay between the halo structure and the reaction mechanism , we follow the idea of and perform a near - side / far - side ( n / f ) analysis of the dea angular distributions ( see also for a review ) . to get a better insight into the influence of breakup onto elastic scattering",
    ", we analyse the angular distributions for both processes simultaneously .",
    "we first give a brief account of the dea and summarise how angular distributions are calculated within this model .",
    "we then derive the n / f decomposition of the elastic - scattering cross section and extend that decomposition to angular distributions for elastic breakup . based on these theoretical developments ,",
    "we analyse the elastic scattering and breakup of be , the archetypal one - neutron halo nucleus , on lead at 69  mev / nucleon , which correspond to the conditions of the riken experiment of .",
    "in a nutshell , the dea @xcite hinges on using a three - body description of the projectile - target system : the projectile @xmath0 is seen as a fragment @xmath1 loosely - bound to a core @xmath2 .",
    "this two - cluster structure is described by the internal hamiltonian @xmath3 , which depends on the @xmath2-@xmath1 relative coordinate @xmath4 and in which the @xmath2-@xmath1 interaction is simulated by a real potential .",
    "the target @xmath5 is seen as a structureless particle , and its interactions with the core and the fragment are simulated by the optical potentials @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in the dea",
    ", the resulting three - body equation is solved using the eikonal ansatz for the wave function : @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 being the component along the beam axis of @xmath10 , the @xmath0-@xmath5 relative coordinate , and @xmath11 the initial momentum of the @xmath0-@xmath5 relative motion . at sufficiently high energy",
    ", @xmath12 varies smoothly with @xmath10 , and its second - order derivative in @xmath10 can be neglected in front of its first - order derivative @xcite .",
    "this leads to the dea equation @xcite iv ( , ) = ( h_0 + v_ct + v_ft - e_0 ) ( , ) , where @xmath13 is the initial @xmath0 velocity , and @xmath14 the ( negative ) energy of the projectile ground - state @xmath15 .",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 correspond to the @xmath2-@xmath1 orbital momentum , the projectile total angular momentum and its projection , respectively .",
    "the spin of the core being neglected , @xmath17 is obtained from the coupling of the fragment spin to the orbital momentum . for each value of @xmath19 , the transverse component of @xmath10 ,",
    "is solved numerically with the initial condition that the projectile is in its ground state : @xmath20    the transition matrix element for elastic scattering from projection @xmath18 to @xmath21 in the direction @xmath22 can be obtained from the solutions of @xcite t_el=2v i^1-|m_0-m_0|e^i(m_0-m_0 ) _ 0^b db j_|m_0-m_0|(qb)s_el , m_0^(m_0)(b ) , where @xmath23 is a bessel function @xcite , @xmath24 is the transferred momentum , and the elastic - scattering amplitudes read s_el , m_0^(m_0)(b)=_l_0j_0m_0()| ^(m_0)(,b , z)_z+ -_m_0m_0 .",
    "following , we divide the @xmath25 matrix element into its near ( n ) and far ( f ) sides by decomposing the bessel function into hankel functions @xcite : @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "the n side corresponds to the expression in which @xmath27 is replaced by @xmath28 , and the f side to the same expression with @xmath29 instead .",
    "the n and f sides are related to positive and negative scattering angles , as can be understood from the asymptotic behaviour of the hankel functions h_^    (    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     )    ( z)()(z/2)^-   > 0 .",
    "this problem can be solved using the asymptotic expression of the hankel functions down to @xmath30 ( dotted lines ) .",
    "this seemingly rough approximation is validated by checking that the angular distribution obtained with the asymptotic expression of the bessel function is identical to its exact expression .",
    "this comparison also confirms the interpretation of the n / f decomposition as positive and negative deflections in elastic breakup .",
    "we observe that the breakup process is also dominated by the n side , and that the oscillatory pattern observed at forward angles and the exponential drop of the cross section beyond @xmath31 are not due to n / f interferences .",
    "this similarity with elastic scattering suggests that the forward - angle features are due to a process similar to a coulomb rainbow .",
    "to confirm this idea , we perform calculations with both p - s and p - p coulomb interactions and display their n sides in . again , the p - p calculation does not exhibit any oscillation nor sudden drop , as already noted in the dea calculation of the coulomb breakup of b ( see fig .  7 of )",
    ". the p - s calculation also exhibits a pattern similar to the coulomb rainbow observed in elastic scattering .",
    "this illustrates that the @xmath0-@xmath5 interactions affect the angular distributions for both elastic scattering and breakup in a similar way , suggesting that the breakup channel does not affect the features of the elastic - scattering cross section .    to complete this study",
    ", we repeat our calculations with extended / compacted be - like projectiles .",
    "their n sides , displayed in ( upper and lower dashed curves ) , confirm the elastic - scattering results , that the slope of the drop of the angular distribution is slightly sensitive to the projectile extension .",
    "note that this conclusion holds although the magnitude of the breakup cross section varies widely with the binding of the projectile , as noted earlier .",
    "in this work , we analyse the angular distribution for elastic scattering and breakup using an extension of the n / f decomposition @xcite applied to the dea that describes coherently both processes @xcite . as expected for coulomb - dominated reactions , we show that the collision of be on pb at 69  mev / nucleon is dominated by the n side , i.e. positive deflection , and that n / f interferences are observed only at large scattering angles .",
    "the coulomb - rainbow features are shown to depend mostly on the nature of the @xmath0-@xmath5 interactions , and in particular their deviation from a purely coulomb potential .",
    "we also observe that the slope of the drop in the angular distribution is sensitive to the extension of the projectile wave function .",
    "these observations hold for both elastic scattering and breakup .    examining both elastic scattering and breakup in parallel",
    ", this work establishes that the loss of flux towards inelastic channels , like breakup or absorption , does not influence the general features mentioned above .",
    "in particular , the slope of the drop of the angular distribution is related to the extension of the projectile , and not to breakup or absorption .",
    "although this sensitivity may be too small to be used as a probe of the halo structure , it can help understanding discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental data .",
    "in particular , it suggests that the reduction of the cross section for elastic - scattering of halo nuclei around the coulomb barrier is not due to a loss of flux towards the breakup channel , as proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , but is more a direct influence of the halo on the collision . to precise this idea , we plan to apply the present methodology , and in particular the parallel study of both elastic scattering and breakup , to low - energy reactions within the continuum discretised coupled channel ( cdcc ) model @xcite",
