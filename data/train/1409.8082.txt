    "the field of cavity optomechanics is historically closely related to the problem of force sensing in the context of gravitational wave detection @xcite , and the fundamental limit of force sensitivity can be traced back to the quantum - mechanical nature of the detector , the so - called standard quantum limit @xcite .",
    "most optomechanical devices to date operate in the regime where the radiation pressure is sufficiently weak on the single - photon level so the coupling between phonons and photons can be linearized .",
    "examples for exciting progress in this area include the observation of ground - state cooling @xcite , ponderomotive squeezing @xcite , radiation - pressure shot - noise @xcite , and mechanical zero - point motion via sideband thermometry @xcite as well as the demonstration of displacement detection close to the standard quantum limit @xcite .",
    "advances in fabricating optomechanical devices promise increasingly large coupling strengths @xcite making nonlinear quantum effects @xcite a possible reality in the near future .",
    "it is thus of great interest to study how the intrinsically nonlinear radiation pressure can be exploited in novel devices .    in this paper",
    "we propose sensitive force detection exploiting optical bistability in an optomechanical system @xcite .",
    "the optomechanical system we consider consists of a laser - driven optical cavity whose resonance frequency is modulated by the displacement of a mechanical oscillator @xcite . under certain conditions the system exhibits an optical bistability ,",
    "i.e.  it has two classically stable states with potentially largely different cavity fields .",
    "shot - noise fluctuations in the coherent drive of the cavity will cause transitions between the two branches whose switching rates can depend strongly on cavity detuning .",
    "a weak periodic forcing of the mechanical resonator will modulate the cavity detuning and thus the switching rates allowing the detection of weak forces in the cavity spectrum .",
    "note that exploiting periodic modulation of switching rates in bistable systems to detect small coherent signals has also been discussed in the context of stochastic resonance @xcite and josephson bifurcation amplifiers @xcite .    in the following",
    "we calculate numerically the switching dynamics in the single - photon strong - coupling regime and zero temperature limit using a stochastic quantum master equation .",
    "we obtain the switching rates and their dependence on the detuning from the residence time distribution .",
    "we then develop a two - state rate equation model allowing us to write the output spectral density of the amplitude quadrature as the sum of a low - frequency noise background and a signal peak caused by the weak harmonic force .",
    "the homodyne signal amplitude depends linearly on the force amplitude and on the difference between the cavity output fields .",
    "bistable optomechanical systems can thus be used as linear amplifiers whose bandwidth is the switching rate and which have a potentially large gain for low - frequency signals .    the remainder of the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
