    "guided by experiment , e.g. in @xmath1c @xcite and @xmath2o @xcite it is a long standing opinion that the spin - orbit splitting of the @xmath0 single particle levels in @xmath0 hypernuclei should be very small or almost zero .",
    "the most prominent theoretical explanation for this effect has been given through the quark - spin substructure of the @xmath0 leading to an additional @xmath0@xmath3 tensor coupling that almost exactly cancels the more conventional scalar - vector spin - orbit force of the @xmath0 single particle states in finite systems @xcite .",
    "a reanalysis of older @xmath4c@xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6o@xmath5 @xcite proton emitter emulsion data by dalitz _",
    "_ , however , lead already to a remarkably bigger splitting , i.e. @xmath70.8 mev for @xmath1c and 1.56@xmath80.12 mev for @xmath2o though the statistics was not so good .",
    "new experiments at kek , measuring high resolution @xmath0 single - particle spectra for medium and heavy hypernuclei , show a spin - orbit splitting for the @xmath0 levels in the range of 12 mev @xcite .",
    "this is quite sizeable but still smaller by a factor of about 2 than the splitting to be expected from the general quenching of @xmath0n interactions .    in this letter",
    "we will show that the reduced splitting in medium and heavy nuclei can be attributed to the strong delocalization of the @xmath0 wave functions in the nucleus due to the shallow @xmath0 potential ( sect .",
    "[ sec : deloc ] ) . in light nuclei with",
    "weakly bound @xmath0 states particle threshold effects are superimposed on the general delocalization .",
    "the very small splitting in light nuclei is due to these continuum threshold effects which lead to a squeezing of the single particle levels close to threshold and thereby almost completely dilutes generic spin - orbit potential effects in this mass region ( sect .",
    "[ sec : thresh ] ) . according to our investigations , the extremely small splitting of the spin - orbit doublets in light @xmath0 hypernuclei as well as the reduced splitting of those in medium to heavy hypernuclei can be completely explained in the framework of the density dependent relativistic hadron ( ddrh ) field theory @xcite .",

    "[ cols= \" < , > , > \" , ]     a suitable measure for the reduced overlap of the @xmath0 wave function with the nuclear interior is to define a localization coefficient by @xmath10 describing the fraction of the probability density which is localized within the volume @xmath11 . here",
    ", @xmath12 is the upper component of the respective dirac wave function and @xmath13 is chosen such that @xmath14 for @xmath15 . in table",
    "[ tab : deloc ] values @xmath16 for @xmath17 for @xmath0 and neutron orbitals in a number of nuclei are shown .",
    "the overlap of the @xmath0 wave functions with the bulk of the nuclear mass distribution is seen to be strongly reduced compared to corresponding neutron states .",
    "the delocalization increases rapidly with decreasing binding energy with a particular strong enhancement for @xmath0 states .",
    "the results show clearly that a sizeable part of the @xmath0 wave function lies `` outside '' the nucleus , a much larger fraction than in the neutron case . a comparison with experiment , see figure  [ fig : expy ] and table  [ tab : expv ] , shows that this mechanism is able to explain the fine structure of @xmath0 single particle spectra .",
    "experimentally observed single particle spectra in low mass @xmath0 hypernuclei show a much more drastic reduction of the spin - orbit splitting .",
    "this led to the conjecture that the spin - orbit splitting in hypernuclei should be in general very small and could be reasonably explained by assuming that the spin of the @xmath0 is carried solely by the strange quark .",
    "the level spacing in light nuclei is , however , strongly affected by the continuum threshold which is in these small systems  especially for the rather weakly bound @xmath0s  quasi omnipresent .",
    "as is known from neutron rich nuclei , e.g. @xcite , the single particle level spacing becomes compressed for states approaching the threshold .",
    "o when the doublet s centroid is pushed towards the continuum threshold .",
    "the dot marks the actual theoretical value for @xmath6o , the data point is taken from @xcite.,width=294 ]    the threshold compression effect is visible already in the ca region but is especially important around and below @xmath6o . the typical feature in these nuclei is that the centroid energy of a spin - orbit doublet is rather close to threshold , mainly because of the shallowness of the binding potential . under such conditions",
    "the spectrum of valence levels becomes compressed inducing an apparent reduction of spin - orbit strength because the less bound j=@xmath18 - 1/2 member of a spin - orbit doublet tries to avoid the crossing in the unbound region .",
    "this `` hindrance '' is related to the general phenomenon of `` avoided level crossing '' in quantal systems because passing over into the continuum means that for example a @xmath19-level would have to cross the region of low energy s - wave continuum levels before re - appearing as a single particle resonance .",
    "we illustrate these special effects for the 1p spin - orbit doublet in @xmath2o . approaching the continuum threshold",
    "is enforced by modifying artificially the @xmath0 potential depth by variation of the @xmath0@xmath3 coupling constant .",
    "figure  [ fig : thresh ] shows the dependence of the splitting strength of the 1p doublet on the centroid energy @xmath20 .",
    "even strongly bound states ( e@xmath21 - 6mev ) are still considerably affected by the threshold .",
    "the effect only saturates if a state of another parity from the continuum is lowered into the bound region , in this example a @xmath22 orbit . the same behavior is also found in the 1p - shell doublet in @xmath4c , often referred to as the `` standard hypernucleus '' .",
    "the continuum threshold effect reflects the peculiar dependence of matrix elements on wave function overlaps for weakly bound states .",
    "in such cases - as observed in recent studies of pure isospin dripline nuclei - generic properties of interactions are masked behind wave function effects .",
    "this has important consequences for extracting the desired information on the underlying interaction from data : the threshold effect leads to local variations in energy splittings not following the systematics derived from well bound systems .",
    "obviously , this will strongly inhibit a model independent derivation of @xmath0 interaction strengths from measurements , especially in light nuclei . around and beyond a@xmath2340",
    ", however , the threshold effect rapidly vanishes . since the new kek data @xcite for @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    "were obtained in mass region well outside the threshold regime they can be expected to provide suitable information on the generic @xmath0 spin - orbit strength , indicating a larger value than assumed before .",
    "the larger than expected spin - orbit splitting observed in recent kek experiments on medium mass nuclei are well reproduced by relativistic ddrh mean - field calculations .",
    "universal parameter sets , derived previously from dirac - brueckner theory , were used .",
    "the results indicate that the medium dependence of hyperon - coupling constants is essential for the good description .",
    "the calculations explain consistently also the apparent suppression of spin - orbit strength for weakly bound @xmath0 orbitals in light nuclei by the compression of spectra close to the continuum threshold due to avoided level crossing .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize strongly the importance of high - resolution data , like those of ref .",
    "@xcite , for hypernuclear structure theory and the understanding of hyperon interactions .",
