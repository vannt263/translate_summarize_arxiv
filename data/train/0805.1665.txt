    "hi  surveys of the virgo cluster @xcite have revealed a remarkable hi  cloud , virgohi  21 , with apparent evidence of rotation yet unaccompanied by any optical emission . the hi  mass ( @xmath6  @xmath4 ) , inferred circular velocity ( @xmath7  km  s@xmath2 ) and physical size ( @xmath8  kpc ) are all typical of luminous galaxies of dynamical masses @xmath9",
    "@xmath4  yet deep optical follow - up observations provide an upper limit of only 31.1 @xmath10 mag  arcsec@xmath11 , corresponding to a stellar content of 2@xmath1210@xmath13  @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "thus , virgohi  21  is currently considered the prototypical dark galaxy candidate : a dynamically - massive dark - matter - dominated galaxy with a rotating gaseous disk but devoid of stars .",
    "if virgohi  21  is a massive dark galaxy , then it has important implications for the theory of structure formation . the highly - successful cosmological hierarchical clustering model originated by @xcite",
    "is based on the idea of accretion and merging of cold dark matter ( cdm ) from small sizes ( @xmath1510@xmath16  @xmath4 ) up to the large galaxy clusters observed at the present epoch .",
    "the cdm model predicts a large number of @xmath1710@xmath16  @xmath4  dark matter ( dm ) halos should remain unassimilated following hierarchical growth and thus still be present today ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to date , however , the number of observed low - mass galaxies falls far short of these predictions .",
    "this is true locally , where only a handful of satellites surround the massive local group spirals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is manifest in the faint end of the luminosity function that shows a slope more shallow than @xmath18cdm predictions @xcite .",
    "this shortcoming of the @xmath18cdm model can be overcome either by preventing small dm halos from forming in the first place or by suppressing star formation so that they remain optically faint .",
    "the latter possibility implies a population of low - mass dm halos in which the baryon content remains optically - dark but still visible chiefly through hi  gas emission .",
    "the rarity of isolated extragalactic hi  clouds lacking optical counterparts @xcite suggests that virgohi  21 , if truly massive , is a rare case in favor of this scenario .",
    "an alternative to the dark galaxy interpretation for virgohi  21   @xcite is that it is simply a part of an elongated hi - dominated tidal tail emanating from the nearby luminous galaxy ngc  4254  ( m99 ) .",
    "the tidal tail was caused either by a fly - by encounter with another ( massive ) galaxy @xcite or by ram pressure stripping within the virgo environment .",
    "recent observations show the hi  gas in the tail extends from ngc  4254 , located @xmath15120 kpc to the south of virgohi  21 , to about 130  kpc beyond virgohi  21  to the north @xcite .",
    "the peculiar velocity structure in the vicinity of virgohi  21  is , in this case , ascribed to projection effects on the streaming motions of the debris tail instead of to rotation within a gravitationally bound disk . in this scenario ,",
    "the estimated hi  mass is close to the total mass of the object ; there is no massive halo accompanying virgohi  21 .    in ",
    "[ analysis ] we describe the _ swift_observations leading to upper limits of the x - ray emission from virgohi  21 , and in   [ discussion ] we provide our interpretation of the _ swift _  non - detection . in this paper",
    "we assume a distance to the source of @xmath19 mpc corresponding to the mean of the virgo cluster @xcite and a scale of 4.9  kpc per arcminute .",
    "the virgohi  21  field was observed by _ swift _  on 2008 april 22 and 26 with the _ xrt _  operated in photon counting mode .",
    "the _ xrt _  has a very low detector background , which makes it especially suitable for observations of faint diffuse x - ray sources .",
    "these data are the first pointed x - ray observations of virgohi  21 .",
    "the data were screened for bad pixels and other detector artifacts , and only photon grades 0 - 12 were included in the analysis .",
    "the screening resulted in 9.2 ks of clean data . in this analysis we considered photon energies in the 0.3 - 7 kev range , where the calibration of the _ xrt _  is better understood .",
    "the data reduction was performed using xselect and the ftools , and the spectral analysis with xspec .",
    "virgohi  21  lies about 1 mpc to the nw of the center of the virgo cluster at r.a.@xmath2012@xmath2117@xmath2253.6@xmath23 decl.@xmath20 + 144525  ( j2000.0 ) .",
    "the angular size of virgohi  21 , 3.5@xmath121.375 , lies well within the 24@xmath1224  field of view of the _ xrt_@xcite .",
    "x - ray images of the virgohi  21  field are shown in figure [ image ] , in which the gray contour are from the hi  observations of @xcite .",
    "the upper part of the hi  feature was interpreted by @xcite as a rotating disc , and the lower part as an hi  bridge connecting virgohi  21  with ngc  4254 , located to the south and outside the _ swift _  field of view .    as with normal galaxies , virgohi  21",
    "was expected to be a source of both diffuse and point - source x - ray emission . even in the absence of stars ,",
    "gas falling into a galaxy s gravitational potential from the intergalactic medium should be heated to roughly the ( x - ray - emitting ) virial temperature .",
    "in addition , accretion onto a central supermassive black hole from the gas reservoir in virgohi  21 , even at a fraction of the bondi rate , should appear as a localized source of x - radiation though not necessarily optically bright .",
    "no x - ray emission associated with virgohi  21  was detected .",
    "an unrelated weak ( 41 counts ) point - like source was detected near r.a.=12@xmath2417@xmath2523@xmath26 , decl.=14@xmath273929(figure [ image ] ) . as no object",
    "is known within 1  of this location , we regard this as the discovery of the x - ray source swift - xrt  j121723 + 1439.5 . in the following ,",
    "we place upper limits to the presence of diffuse and point source emission from virgohi  21 .      in order to place upper limits to the diffuse soft x - ray emission from virgohi  21 , we accumulated x - ray photons from a 3.5@xmath121.375   region located at the position of the putative hi  disc ( black box in figure [ image ] ) .",
    "we detected a total of 8 counts in the 0.3 - 2 kev band , and no counts in the 2 - 7 kev band .",
    "we estimate the number of background counts , first by extracting the data from the entire field of view , excluding a region of enhanced emission to the south ( figure [ image ] ) and regions close to the detector boundaries . the region included encompassed 337.3 square arcminutes .",
    "we found @xmath28 counts in the 0.3 - 2 kev band and @xmath29 counts in the 2 - 7 kev band . ignoring the possibility that some of these events might be vignetted by the telescope one therefore expects in the region of interest at least @xmath30 counts in the soft band and @xmath31 in the hard band .",
    "we note that it is mildly interesting and somewhat improbable that no counts were measured in the hard band from the region containing virgohi  21 .",
    "we use the soft x - ray band data in order to set upper limits as to source detection , since this is the band in which the x - ray emission from diffuse gas ( and point sources ) is expected . since the measured background predicts at least a mean of 8.9@xmath320.4 counts and we detected 8 counts it is therefore evident that the virgohi  21  region is not an x - ray emitter . to determine upper limits  we increased the expected number of counts in the soft band by 10% to 9.8 counts to account for the possibility that some of the measured background events arise from faint , unresolved x - ray sources .",
    "we determine 99%-confidence upper limits assuming 18 counts as detection .",
    "we assume that the hi  disk is seen edge - on , and thus the emitting volume is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35. we use an optically - thin plasma of uniform density and of solar abundance ( apec in xspec ) , a galactic hi  column density of @xmath36 @xmath1 @xcite with @xcite cross - sections ( wabs in xspec ) , and calculate the emission measure required to achieve 8.1 source counts as a function of plasma temperature using xspec .",
    "the emission measure calculated by xspec is given by the model normalization , @xmath37 , as @xmath38 in which @xmath39 and @xmath40 are , respectively , the electron and hydrogen number density and @xmath41 the angular size distance ( for @xmath42 ) . from this , we calculate the gas density , and thus the gas mass . the results are shown in figure [ limits ] , showing that these 9.2 ks _ swift__xrt",
    "_  observations set upper limits of the order of @xmath43 .",
    "these upper limits correspond to a flux of @xmath0 ergs  @xmath1  s@xmath2  in the 0.3 - 2 kev band .",
    "a putative hot halo may be maintained in hydrostatic equilibrium by the gravitational potential of the galaxy . in this case",
    ", the gas density will decrease with radius .",
    "we therefore consider a more realistic model of the gas density given by the @xmath44 model , @xmath45 as often observed in galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath44 describe , respectively , the radius within which the density is approximately constant , and the decrease of the density at large radii . for this interpretation , we use a spherically symmetrical model in which the galaxy has a radius of @xmath34. in this region , the background in the 0.3 - 2 kev band has a mean of 16.3 counts , and we thus place the 99% confidence upper limit at 27 total counts ( or 10.7 source counts ) , following the method described in   [ sec : uniform ] . using the @xmath44 model ( equation [ beta ] ) into equation [ norm ] , we obtain upper limits to the central gas density : @xmath47 in which the integration of the density profile has led to the integral @xmath48 .",
    "we use two reference values for the index @xmath44 : a value of @xmath44=2/3 , as usually measured in galaxy clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a shallower slope of @xmath44=1/3 , which may be typical of lower - mass halos ( e.g. , galaxy groups and galaxies ) .",
    "we find analytical solutions for the integral , @xmath49 for @xmath44=2/3 , and @xmath50 for @xmath44=1/3 .",
    "we then estimate the upper limits to the gas mass by integration of the density profile , @xmath51 in which the @xmath44 model profile has led to the integral @xmath52 .",
    "this integral is @xmath53 for @xmath54 , and @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "we estimate upper limits to the gas mass as function of plasma temperature using equations [ neo ] and [ mgas ] , using a fiducial value of the core radius of 0.5 ( figure [ limits ] ) .",
    "we determine that the upper limits to the gas mass depend weakly on the choice of the core radius , given that varying the fiducial value by @xmath32100% results in variation of less than 10% .",
    "this model results in upper limits to the gas mass that are in the range of @xmath57 @xmath4 .",
    "upper limits to the gas mass are therefore similar to those obtained from the simple uniform density model of section [ sec : uniform ] .",
    "we set upper limits to the luminosity of an unobserved point source anywhere within the 3.5 x 1.375 region of interest .",
    "the upper limit takes into account that there are 68 statistically - independent swift spatial resolution elements within this region , given that the half - power diameter of the _ xrt _  point spread function at 1.5 kev is 18 `` .",
    "the measured background , per 18''-diameter spatial resolution element is 0.131 , or 0.144 using a + 10% allowance for vignetting .",
    "thus , considering the poisson distribution with a mean of 0.144 and a total of 4 counts , there is a probability of only @xmath58 of measuring 4 or more counts in just one of these resolution elements .",
    "of course we would have been happy to measure 4 or more counts in any one of the 68 elements so the joint probability is correspondingly larger .",
    "thus , we may state , with approximately 99.9%-confidence that we have not detected a a source of 4 counts or brighter from this region .",
    "we consider a power - law emission model with photon index @xmath59 and determine the upper limits to the source luminosity as function of the absorbing hi  column density using xspec .",
    "the upper limits are shown in figure [ limits ] , and are in the @xmath60 ergs  s@xmath2  range .",
    "this upper limit corresponds to a flux of 8@xmath61 ergs  @xmath1  s@xmath2  in the 0.3 - 2 kev band .      for completeness",
    ", we also analyzed extant non - x - ray images of virgohi  21 .",
    "_ swift _  uvot images using the uvm2 filter ( effective wavelength 2231  ) were obtained concurrently with the xrt data .",
    "no sources were detected within the angular extent of virgohi  21 .",
    "the ftools utility uvotsource was used to estimate a limiting magnitude for the uv emission from the 3.5@xmath121.375  region enclosing virgohi  21 .",
    "this limit does not improve our estimates of the upper limit to the mass of diffuse hot gas nor to the flux from a point source as estimated above from the x - ray data .",
    "we also analyzed archival _",
    "data ( program i d 30725 ) which included all four irac and three mips spectral bands .",
    "again , no extended emission was detected within the hi  extent of virgohi  21 .",
    "we estimate an upper limit to the mass of dust associated with virgohi  21  to be 10@xmath6210@xmath63  @xmath4  depending on the dust temperature assumed .",
    "a search for x - ray emission from the hi  line source virgohi  21  using the _ swift _  _ xrt _  obtained only upper limits .",
    "the non - detection indicates that any diffuse x - ray emitting gas at @xmath64 kev must be less massive than @xmath3 @xmath4 , depending on the gas temperature and its spatial distribution .",
    "given that the _ swift__xrt _  detector has no effective area approximately below 0.1 kev , it is possible that significant amounts of gas at sub - virial temperature have gone undetected by this x - ray observation .",
    "similarly , any x - ray point source associated with virgohi  21  will have a luminosity lower than @xmath65 ergs  s@xmath2 , depending on the absorbing column density of gas along the line of sight .",
    "how do these limits compare with expectations ?",
    "there are well - established correlations between optical and x - ray light from galaxies : typical @xmath66  ratios for normal galaxies range from @xmath67 to @xmath68 and for galaxies hosting agns the range extends up to unity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for the dark galaxy virgohi  21",
    ", these ratios predict an x - ray flux of @xmath69 to @xmath70 for a normal galaxy up to @xmath71 if an agn is present .",
    "of course , these @xmath66  correlations reflect the causal link between stellar processes and x - ray light .",
    "they are not expected to hold in the absence of stars .",
    "instead , our expectation that virgohi  21  should be a source of diffuse x - ray emission stems from the fundamental picture @xcite that gas falling into a dm halo is first heated to the virial temperature .",
    "the accumulation of hot gas over a hubble time could be substantial for a massive dm halo like virgohi  21  @xcite .",
    "we would expect a gas virial temperature of approximately 0.4  kev based on the observed kinematics of virgohi  21  ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and thus our best guess to the amount of hot gas associated with virgohi  21  is @xmath72  @xmath4 . scaling from simulations of gas infall onto stable disk galaxies @xcite , the x - ray luminosity of this gas should be up to 5@xmath1210@xmath73  ergs  s@xmath2  for rotation speeds similar to that of virgohi  21 .",
    "the above estimates are based on the assumption of an isolated ` quiescent ' massive galaxy accreting slowly ( i.e. , with a long cooling time ) from the surrounding intergalactic medium . in the particular case of virgohi  21 , in contrast ,",
    "a considerable gas reservoir exists within the tidal tail emanating from ngc  4254  that should lead to a relatively high gas accretion rate and hence high x - ray luminosity .",
    "furthermore , turbulence and shocks following the interaction between virgohi  21  and ngc  4254  would very likely heat some portion of the disk hi  gas component of virgohi  21  to x - ray emitting temperatures .",
    "we therefore consider the above estimates to be minimal expectations .",
    "of course , any prediction of the amount of hot gas or its luminosity will scale with the dynamical mass of the accreting object .",
    "the observed upper limits reported here , therefore , show that the extreme object virgohi  21  is _ not _ an extreme x - ray object ( in the sense of a high @xmath66 ) nor has it accreted very much gas from its surroundings during its lifetime ."
