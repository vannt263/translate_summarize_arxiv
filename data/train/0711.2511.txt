    "the baryon asymmetry of the universe remains a mystery .",
    "many ideas have been formulated in the literature , yet much uncertainty remains as to how the baryon asymmetry could arise .",
    "it is not even clear at what scale the initial asymmetry is produced .",
    "the sakharov conditions for baryogenesis are baryon number violation , @xmath5 and @xmath6 violation , and a departure from equilibrium .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) does not exhibit these conditions at nearly the strength required to produce the observed asymmetry given our standard cosmological assumptions , and thus it is expected that we must go beyond the sm in order to explain the asymmetry .    the last sakharov condition , departure from equilibrium , implies the necessity of a strong first - order phase transition . since we know that the electroweak symmetry must be broken it is tempting to assume that the corresponding phase transition can satisfy this condition . as noted above , the sm is inadequate , but how far beyond the sm must one go to find the necessary out of equilibrium dynamics ?",
    "this question has been addressed by a number of authors ( e.g. , see  @xcite for studies of the dynamics of the electroweak phase transition in various recent models ) . in ref .  @xcite it was shown that if the higgs potential is augmented merely by a @xmath7 operator , it can generate a strong first - order electroweak phase transition .",
    "as one can intuit , the scale suppressing this non - renormalizable operator must be in the neighborhood of the electroweak scale in order to generate a substantive effect on the phase transition dynamics .",
    "a tree - level analysis of this theory was conducted in  @xcite , with some further refinements in  @xcite , and it was concluded that a strong first order phase transition is possible even with a higgs boson as massive as 200  gev . of course , for the presence of this @xmath7 operator to be compatible with electroweak ( ew ) precision data , a higher scale should suppress other dimension six operators , in particular those leading to oblique corrections .",
    "the analysis of  @xcite shows that the low energy effective theories of strongly interacting models , where a light composite higgs emerges as a pseudo - goldstone boson , have precisely this structure and single out @xmath7 as one of the dominant dimension six operators   operator since it is the only one that affects the shape of the potential at tree - level , and thus it has significant effects on the dynamics of the phase transition as we shall see . ] , being suppressed by the decay constant of the strong sector , parametrically lighter than the cutoff scale of the model . for a fixed value of the strong decay constant ,",
    "the compatibility with precision ew data is ensured by pushing the masses of vector resonances above 2.5  tev  @xcite . in that case",
    "a decay constant as low as 300  gev would be compatible with precision measurements .",
    "our analysis should also apply to study the dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking in little higgs models , and to the more general cases where the @xmath7 operator is generated by integrating out a heavy massive scalar field .",
    "however , some extra fine - tunings might be needed in that case to evade ew precision data .    in this publication",
    "we extend the results of  @xcite in several ways .",
    "first , we re - analyze the theory using the full finite temperature effective ( nonrenormalizable ) higgs potential at one - loop .",
    "second , we study the nucleation of broken phase bubbles and consider the effects of supercooling on the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) within this more complete analysis .",
    "this is an important dynamical consideration of the phase transition that can in principle have dramatic consequences to when ( and if ) the phase transition happens .",
    "finally , we investigate whether or not the gravitational waves emitted at the nucleation time can be detected by present and future interferometry experiments , which would provide another way to study the origin of ew symmetry breaking and another way to test the composite nature of the higgs .",
    "we consider each of these points in the following three sections , and then make some concluding remarks .",
    "once non - renormalizable interactions are allowed in the theory , as in our case , complete renormalization requires that the infinite set of higher - order operators be considered . however , one is able to truncate the list of needed operators in a perturbative expansion of the inverse cutoff scale . to study the effect of new physics on the higgs potential in this effective field theory context , it is sufficient to work at the order @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the cutoff scale suppressing the effective operators .",
    "higher dimensional operators will be sufficiently irrelevant to our problem and can be ignored .",
    "our analysis is focussed on operators that affect the higgs self - interactions .",
    "these effective interactions parametrize the new physics responsible for ew symmetry breaking that become fully dynamical at about the scale @xmath9 .",
    "thus they can be used to generically constrain beyond - the - sm physics affecting the higgs sector . though ew precision measurements put severe constraints on the set of operators affecting the weak bosons polarization tensors ,",
    "the effective higgs self - interactions are almost completely free parameters since the higgs sector has not yet been probed directly by experiment .",
    "thus the scale suppressing the operator @xmath7 we will focus on can be significantly lower than the cutoff scale of the ( strongly coupled ) model .",
    "this is in particular the case of composite higgs models when the higgs emerges from a strongly - interacting sector as a light pseudo - goldstone boson  @xcite .",
    "the scale suppressing the @xmath7 operator is then @xmath10 , the decay constant of the strong sector , a quantity 4@xmath11 smaller that the cutoff scale .",
    "we start with the following classical effective potential for the sm higgs @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 which develops a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) equal to @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is identified at tree level with the decay constant of the strong sector ",
    "the details of this identification at one - loop are described later .",
    "we choose a vacuum configuration where only the real part of the neutral component has a constant background value : @xmath16 .",
    "the physical higgs boson is @xmath17 , and we use the traditional background field method  @xcite to evaluate the quantum potential for @xmath18 at one - loop .",
    "we focus on the main relevant contributions coming from the @xmath19 gauge bosons , the top quark , and the higgs and goldstone scalars .",
    "as we briefly review in appendix  [ app : review_technics ] , the quantum potential for the background value up to one - loop order at finite temperature in the landau gauge ( where ghosts decouple ) is @xmath20 with @xmath21 \\label{eqn : fullv1eff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the euclidean loop 4-momentum , @xmath23 are the matsubara frequencies in the imaginary time formalism , where @xmath24 for bosons ( periodic on the euclidean time circle ) and @xmath25 for fermions ( anti - periodic on the euclidean time circle ) .",
    "the numbers of degrees of freedom for the relevant fields are @xmath26 .",
    "we include the fermion - loop minus sign in the definition of @xmath27 .",
    "note that in the landau gauge one must count all three degrees of freedom of each massive vector boson _ and _ the one degree of freedom of each goldstone scalar .",
    "this may be qualitatively understood be recalling that the @xmath28 goldstone fields are independent quantum fluctuations away from the zero - temperature minimum .",
    "we present a quantitative argument showing this is not double counting in appendix [ app : review_technics ] .",
    "we obtain the background - dependent masses appearing in ( [ eqn : fullv1eff ] ) by expanding the theory about the background value @xmath18 and reading off the quadratic terms for the various quantum fluctuations . in our dimension - six model",
    "the masses are @xmath29 where @xmath30,@xmath31 and @xmath32 are the @xmath33 , @xmath34 and top yukawa couplings respectively . at the zero - temperature minimum one",
    "recovers @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "note that the expressions for the masses of the weak bosons ( from the higgs kinetic term ) and the top quark ( from the yukawa coupling ) are unchanged compared to the sm , and ( [ eqn : nonscalarmasses ] ) are written to confirm our conventions .",
    "the one - loop correction ( [ eqn : fullv1eff ] ) splits into a zero - temperature part and a @xmath37-dependent part  @xcite which vanishes as @xmath38 : @xmath39 with @xmath40\\\\ \\delta v_1^{t}(\\phi , t)&=&\\sum_{i = h,\\chi , w , z , t}\\frac{n_i",

    "the @xmath44 part , being uv - divergent , will be considered first in order to properly determine the renormalized parameters of the quantum theory .",
    "the finite temperature corrections will be treated afterwards .      at zero temperature",
    "the correction ( [ eqn : fullv1eff ] ) reduces to the first term of ( [ eqn : v1split ] ) , @xmath45\\label{eqn : dimregpot1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which has been regularized in @xmath46 dimensions , @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) for gauge bosons ( scalars and fermions ) and @xmath49 .",
    "we work in the @xmath50 scheme to renormalize and evaluate our potential ( see the appendix  [ sec : t=0corrections ] for an alternative , but ultimately equivalent , on - shell scheme approach ) .",

    ", we must impose renormalization conditions at some chosen scale @xmath53 .",

    "the vev depends on the choice of scale as well .",
    "we define @xmath58 to be equal to the vev of the higgs field in the landau gauge at @xmath59 such that the @xmath50 @xmath57 mass is recovered .",
    "performing our computations with the latest electroweak precision measurements  @xcite , we find @xmath60 to a good approximation for a higgs mass in our range of interest ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "this higgs vev is close to the @xmath62 value in  @xcite .",
    "we can invert these equations to obtain the theory parameters as a function of measurements : m^2 _ * & = & m^2(m_h^2,,v_0 , _ * ) + _ * & = & ( m_h^2,,v_0 , _ * ) + _ * & = & ( m^2_h,,v_0 , _ * ) note , the parameters have scale dependence , and we have defined @xmath63 , etc .    up to now",
    "we have glossed over some important subtleties .",
    "the physical higgs mass must be defined at @xmath64 , whereas the one - loop effective potential is constructed for @xmath65 . to take account of this , and retain the label @xmath66 for the physical higgs boson mass , we need to rewrite the renormalization condition as m^2_h m^2_h-(m^2_h)+(0 ) , where @xmath67 is the two - point function of the higgs boson ( numerically , we used the looptools software  @xcite to evaluate this two - point function ) .",
    "this approach has the added benefit that the ir singularity in @xmath68 as the goldstone mass goes to zero is canceled by the ir singularity in @xmath69 .",
    "we discuss these ir singularity issues in more detail in the appendix  [ app : onshell ] .",
    "the physical parameter @xmath55 is not a unique choice for how to parametrize the measured tri - higgs coupling , and we wish to rewrite it in a more convenient manner .",
    "first , like the higgs mass , the higgs tri - scalar coupling has ir divergences at @xmath65 when the goldstone bosons become massless .",
    "these ir divergences are also not dangerous because they are matched by the ir divergences of @xmath70 , and cancel in measured cross - sections .",
    "thus , it is convenient to separate out this ir divergence when parametrizing the tri - higgs coupling observable : @xmath71 , where @xmath72 contains ir sensitive goldstone terms is given by @xmath73 ^ 3}{m^2_\\chi(v_0)}\\right]$ ] , where @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath75 is given by the above expression where the limit @xmath76 is taken in @xmath77 . ] .",
    "furthermore , since the tri - higgs coupling @xmath55 in the sm is fixed once the higgs mass is known , we would like our convention to reflect this manifestly in the decoupling limit of @xmath78 , _ 0 ^sm_f^sm+_ir^sm for finite values of @xmath79 , the deviations of @xmath80 from @xmath81 can be defined by convention to be _",
    "this convention ( i.e. , the factor of 6 ) ensures that @xmath15 can be identified directly as the decay constant of the strong sector , @xmath10 , at tree level .",
    "putting these elements together , we can now rewrite the third renormalization condition as v_eff(v_0)=^sm_f++_ir .",
    "[ eq : xi ] we emphasize that eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi ] ) is merely a reparametrization of the tri - higgs physical observable in terms of the decay constant , @xmath10 , rather than @xmath55 for the benefits described above , and that @xmath81 is a computable function of @xmath54 .    following the prescription provided above , all the parameters of our higgs potential ( @xmath51 )",
    "can now be written in terms of physical observables ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "thus , we are now able to analyze the potential using physical observables as inputs .      from the splitting  ( [ eqn : v1split ] ) of the full one - loop effective potential into a @xmath44 part and a @xmath83 part , we get that the latter finite temperature component is : @xmath84\\label{eqn : pottcorrections}\\\\ & \\equiv&\\sum_{i={\\rm bosons}}\\frac{n_it^4}{2\\pi^2 } j_b\\left(\\frac{m^2_i(\\phi)}{t^2}\\right)+\\sum_{i={\\rm fermions}}\\frac{n_it^4}{2\\pi^2 } j_f\\left(\\frac{m^2_i(\\phi)}{t^2}\\right)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the upper ( lower ) sign stands for bosons ( fermions ) . in the high - temperature regime ( @xmath85 ) , the @xmath86 function expansions are @xmath87 with @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "note that in @xcite only the first terms in ( [ eqn : hightb ] ) and ( [ eqn : hightf ] ) were retained , which leads to the following approximate thermal one - loop correction : @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "the dominant contributions gathered in ( [ eqn : v1tgsw ] ) are simply a ( positive ) thermal mass which ( meta)-stabilizes the origin of the potential at high temperature .",
    "this approximation was sufficient in @xcite , and further refined in  @xcite , to demonstrate the possibility of a strong first order pt within an effective extension of the sm .",
    "( [ fig : potentials ] ) shows the discrepancy between the complete thermal correction and the high - temperature expansion around the critical temperature , illustrating the worthwhileness of using the integrals of ( [ eqn : pottcorrections ] ) for the more detailed analysis .",
    "gev and @xmath92  gev ( @xmath10 is the decay constant of the strong sector the higgs emerges from ) .",
    "the dashed curve is the potential of @xcite which includes only the thermal mass term of the higgs , while the solid and dotted ones represent the full one - loop potential with ( solid ) and without ( dotted ) the ring diagram contributions . in blue ,",
    "we have also plotted the imaginary part of the full one - loop potential with the ring contributions ( solid blue ) as well as the imaginary part of the ring contributions alone ( dashed blue ) .",
    "this illustrates the cancelation of the large imaginary parts between the ring and the one - loop contributions , while there still exists an additional and smaller imaginary part for some values of @xmath18 due to a negative quartic coupling ( see the discussion in section  [ sec : imcancelation ] for details ) .",
    "an imaginary part of the potential can be interpreted as a decay rate of some quantum states of the scalar fields to some others but the imaginary part of the full potential is always tiny compared to the real part around the transition temperature and the system is stable enough throughout the entire time of the transition . ]      in thermal quantum field theory , the traditional perturbative expansion in terms of small coupling constants breaks down due to ir - divergences ( inherent in massless models ) generated by long - range fluctuations appearing as soon as one moves to finite temperature @xcite .",
    "for instance , taking massless @xmath93 theory at finite temperature , one can show that the self - energy , which goes like @xmath94 at first order , receives a subleading @xmath95 correction and not @xmath96 as one would expect  @xcite . for our case , in the high - temperature expansion , or equivalently small mass expansion , of the thermal bosonic corrections ( [ eqn : hightb ] ) , we also see a sign of this perturbation theory breakdown through the emergence of a monomial term of order @xmath48 .",
    "the main consequence is that , as it stands , we can not trust the completeness of the one - loop result ( [ eqn : pottcorrections ] ) because there are some higher - loop corrections of the same order @xcite , as if the effect of temperature is to  dilute \" the one - loop correction to some multi - loop orders in the ir .",
    "furthermore the leading part of these multi - loop corrections is all contained in the so - called ring ( or daisy ) diagrams shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : ring ] ) .",
    "they are @xmath97-loop diagrams where @xmath98 of them are  ring attached \" to a main one .",
    "since this  loop - dilution \" is a finite temperature effect , the ring diagrams only need to be resummed in the ir - limit of vanishing momenta running in their petals @xcite .",
    "it is also well - known that they can be taken into account by using propagators resummed in the ir  @xcite . by solving a dyson - like equation ,",
    "this turns out to simply shift the bosonic masses by a @xmath37-dependent constant as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the self - energy of the ( bosonic ) field @xmath101 in the ir limit , @xmath102 , known as a debye mass ( @xmath100 is labeled as @xmath103 in  @xcite ) .",
    "the higher - loop ring diagrams are needed due to ir divergences ( i.e. , @xmath104 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the one - loop result is trustworthy for massive ( i.e. , @xmath105 ) particles , because the long - range fluctuations arising at finite temperature will never hit an ir mass - pole in such cases .",
    "hence the ring diagrams will only contribute significantly at high - temperature ( @xmath106 ) where the particles can be approximated as nearly massless .",
    "also , this allows us to understand why only the bosonic degrees of freedom feel the breakdown of the perturbative expansion .",
    "the reason is that only bosonic fields have a vanishing matsubara frequency , recalling that @xmath23 equals @xmath107 for bosons and @xmath108 for fermions .",
    "only this particular ( zero-)mode will behave as a massless degree of freedom and generate ir - divergences at high - temperature , while the other ( non zero-)modes @xmath23 act as a mass of order @xmath37 and thus lead to negligible contributions . therefore the fermionic propagators need not be resummed , because fermions do not have pole - mass in the ir .        applying the techniques of  @xcite to our theory ,",
    "we compute the finite temperature mass shifts ( debye masses ) that are needed in the ring diagram resummation : @xmath109 note that these @xmath110 s are computed in the high - temperature limit of the unbroken phase which is justified by the ring diagrams being irrelevant for @xmath111 as we have discussed . at high temperature the photon and @xmath57 are not mass eigenstates , but one can treat them as mass eigenstates in this computation with the above - given debye masses and obtain the correct resummed potential .      the traditional way the ring diagrams are implemented in the literature",
    "consists in shifting all the matsubara modes for the bosonic fields .",
    "this is the so - called self - consistent method @xcite where the potential ( [ eqn : fullv1eff ] ) is replaced by @xmath112.\\ ] ] the thermal shift of the gauge masses only for the longitudinal polarizations is understood , and @xmath113 is simply zero .",
    "however , when applying this approach the uv divergent part becomes @xmath37-dependent through the @xmath110 and requires @xmath37-dependent counter - terms to be made finite . indeed after doing to ( [ eqn : v1tselfconsistent ] ) the same splitting procedure we did to get ( [ eqn : v1split ] ) , and",
    "after dimensionally regularizing the uv - divergent part , we get the following result : @xmath114\\ ] ] where the @xmath115 factor depends on @xmath37 .",
    "this standard technique clashes with physical intuition since it would mean that the uv behavior of the theory depends on the ir dynamics .",
    "although this mixing is not introducing any calculational errors to our working approximation , one can avoid it by simply shifting only the @xmath116 matsubara modes which carry the leading contribution from the ring diagrams relevant at one - loop order .    as argued above",
    ", the dilution of the one - loop correction happens only for massless modes .",
    "hence all the corrections we seek within the ring diagrams are gathered when resumming only the zero - mode of the propagator in the ir .",
    "doing so , ( [ eqn : fullv1eff ] ) is to be replaced by @xmath117\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3}\\log\\left[\\vec{k}^2+m^2_i(\\phi)+\\pi_i(t)\\right]\\big\\}\\\\ & \\equiv&\\delta v_1(\\phi , t)+\\delta v_{ring}(\\phi , t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime means that the zero modes are excluded from the sum .",
    "we can easily extract the ring part from the last expression and we find @xmath118\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\sum_{i = h,\\chi , w , z,\\gamma}\\frac{\\bar{n}_it}{12\\pi}\\left[m^3_i(\\phi)-\\left(m^2_i(\\phi)+\\pi_i(t)\\right)^{3/2}\\right]\\label{eqn : vring},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where an irrelevant ( infinite ) constant has been ignored in the second line , and @xmath119 . notice that @xmath120 includes a monomial of order @xmath48 which proves a posteriori the existence of a perturbation theory breakdown in evaluating the higgs potential .",
    "furthermore , these extra corrections modify the cubic term in @xmath121 , which partly controls the strength of the first order phase transition .",
    "thus , the addition of these terms is critical for our analysis of the electroweak phase transition .    in summary ,",
    "the full @xmath37-dependent renormalized effective potential at one - loop is v_eff()&=&^2+^4 + ^6 + _ i = h,,w , z , tn_i[eqn : potmsbar ] + & & + _ i = bosons j_b()+_i = fermions j_f ( ) + & & + _ i = h,,w , z , where definitions of all terms are given above .",
    "this is the potential we analyze for the remainder of the article .",
    "as the scalar masses become negative , the various contributions we obtained for the quantum potential develop some imaginary parts which we discuss below for both the @xmath44 and @xmath83 cases .      in the zero - temperature limit",
    ", the logarithm of ( [ eqn : potmsbar ] ) leads to the following scheme - independent imaginary part . ]",
    "@xmath122=\\sum_{i = h,\\chi}\\theta(-m^2_i(\\phi))\\frac{n_i |m_i(\\phi)|^4}{64\\pi}\\ ] ] where @xmath123 is the heaviside function which equals 1 when the field @xmath124 is tachyonic , and zero otherwise .",
    "the higgs boson can obtain a negative mass squared for some values of its vev , originating from the fact that the classical potential is not convex everywhere .",
    "indeed , depending on the cutoff value , either the origin is unstable ( @xmath125 ) or a potential barrier separates two local minima ( @xmath126 ) , both of which lead to concave regions of the effective potential as a function of the vev .",
    "a similar analysis shows that the goldstone boson can become tachyonic for some values of the vev as well , leading to another contribution to the imaginary part of the effective potential .",
    "however , we shall see shortly that the imaginary part ( [ eqn : impart0 ] ) exactly cancels out with another contribution coming from the finite temperature corrections for the temperature range we are interested in for the phase transition .      at finite temperature both the integrals of ( [ eqn : pottcorrections ] ) and the ring contributions ( [ eqn : vring ] )",
    "are spoiled by imaginary parts when scalar fields are tachyons . in the high - temperature limit ,",
    "the imaginary part of ( [ eqn : pottcorrections ] ) is ( see ( [ eqn : hightb ] ) ) : @xmath127\\underset{\\frac{|m_i(\\phi)|}{t}\\to 0}{\\longrightarrow}\\   \\sum_{i = h,\\chi}\\theta(-m^2_i(\\phi))n_i\\left[-\\frac{|m_i(\\phi)|^4}{64\\pi}+\\frac{|m_i(\\phi)|^3 t}{12\\pi}\\right].\\label{eqn : imparthight}\\ ] ] the first term cancels the imaginary part from the logarithm of the @xmath44 potential correction ( [ eqn : impart0 ] ) , while the second is only compensated when the ring diagrams are added , since their imaginary part is given by @xmath128=-\\sum_{i = h,\\chi}\\theta(-m^2_i(\\phi))\\frac{n_it}{12\\pi}|m_i(\\phi)|^3\\ ] ] as long as the temperature satisfies @xmath129 for all @xmath18 .",
    "although somewhat more complicated algebraically to show ( see appendix  [ app : imcancelation ] for details ) , this cancellation occurs also for smaller temperatures of order @xmath130 .    nevertheless and despite this cancelation ,",
    "the potential is not everywhere real because for some values of @xmath37 and @xmath131 , @xmath132 and the second term of the ring correction  ( [ eqn : vring ] ) becomes imaginary . in the sm",
    "this term does not lead to an imaginary part once the temperature ( meta)stabilizes the origin since the sm scalars could only become tachyonic for a negative quadratic coupling in the higgs potential .",
    "thus , the sm potential is real as long as the origin is ( meta)stable . on the other hand , with the additional @xmath7 piece in the potential , the scalar masses can be negative also through a negative quartic coupling , allowing this additional imaginary part to the potential at temperature around the critical temperature .",
    "an imaginary part of the potential can be interpreted as a decay rate of some quantum states of the scalar fields to some others  @xcite .",
    "thus , one can rely on the real part of the potential as long as its imaginary part remains small enough to consider the field stable during the phase transition , in which case it can be discarded .",
    "we checked that the imaginary part of the one - loop potential is always tiny compared to the real part around the transition temperature , thanks to the previously demonstrated cancelations of large imaginary pieces .",
    "thus , we conclude that the system is stable enough throughout the entire time of the transition , and that its dynamics is driven by the real part of the one - loop potential we computed .",
    "now that we have the formalism developed for our analysis of the finite temperature higgs potential at one loop , we are in the position to study the dynamics of the phase transition",
    ". one of our first considerations must be the analysis of when ( and if ) the phase transition actually occurs .",
    "this is not simply a matter of determining the temperature at which the symmetry breaking minimum becomes the global minimum .",
    "an analysis of the energetics of bubble formation must be undertaken for a more complete picture .",
    "the nucleated bubbles can then undergo collisions and the surrounding plasma experience turbulence , which generate gravity waves that could possibly be detected in experiments .",
    "we discuss these issues in this section .    throughout this section ,",
    "we report our numerical results of various relevant quantities as contour plots that scan the allowed region of the parameter space @xmath133 .",
    "we recall that @xmath54 is the physical higgs mass while @xmath10 is the decay constant of the strong sector ( or more generally the energy scale suppressing the @xmath7 operator ) physically defined through the triple higgs self - interaction as defined in the previous sections , and we work in the @xmath50 scheme for @xmath59 .",
    "the bounds delinating the region of first - order phase transition are both numerically computed using the complete one - loop potential at finite temperature .",
    "the lower one is set by requiring that ew symmetry is broken at @xmath44 and restores at high temperature , while above the upper bound the higgs vacuum is likely to undergo a second - order phase transition or a smooth crossover . in general , determining the latter is not an easy task as it requires a non - perturbative analysis of the effective potential when the transition is not strongly first - order @xcite .",
    "indeed , the phase transition always appears first - order at the perturbative level , even though very weakly .",
    "moreover , as @xmath10 increases one tends to recover the sm potential , which leads non - perturbatively to a continuous crossover , instead of a weak first - order transition at one - loop , for @xmath134 gev @xcite .",
    "we estimated the upper bound by considering that as soon as the phase transition is as weak as in the sm for @xmath135 gev , it is likely to be a crossover .",
    "the effective potential ensures the presence of a potential barrier at finite temperature which is a necessary ingredient to have a first - order phase transition .",
    "it proceeds by spontaneous nucleation of non - vanishing vev bubbles into a surrounding symmetric metastable vacuum .",
    "as soon as the universe cools down to a critical temperature @xmath136 the symmetry - breaking vacuum becomes energetically favorable and then thermal fluctuations allow the bubbles to form .",

    ". once created , a bubble needs to consume a part of the latent heat liberated in order to maintain its interface with the symmetric phase surrounding it .",
    "it turns out that for @xmath37 just below @xmath136 it is often the case that the bubbles are too small and surface tension makes them collapse and disappear .",
    "hence the phase transition effectively starts at a smaller temperature when enough free energy is available to permit the nucleation of sufficiently large bubbles that can grow and convert the entire universe into the broken phase .",

    "there is a supercooling effect that can delay the onset of the first order phase transition to temperatures much smaller than @xmath148 .",
    "a first order phase transition can only proceed in the presence of a potential barrier separating the two vacua and the nucleation could potentially start at a temperature @xmath149 far below that of @xmath136 .",
    "this is especially likely in the case where the barrier persists down to @xmath44 .",
    "since the amount of supercooling is controlled by the size of the nucleated bubble , one needs to take into account that the phase transition proceeds in an expanding universe .",
    "one can thus consider that the nucleation starts at the time when the probability of creating at least one bubble per horizon volume is of order one .",
    "this condition guarantees the percolation of bubbles in the early universe and translates into the following criterion for determining the nucleation temperature : @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the reduced planck mass .",

    "[ fig : tn ] ) with low @xmath10 and @xmath152 such that the criterion eq .",
    "( [ eqn : nucleation ] ) is not satisfied , meaning that the expansion of the universe does not permit the bubbles to percolate .",
    "thus the nucleation never starts and the universe remains trapped in a symmetric vacuum .",
    "in addition , the right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : tn ] helps one to realize further the numerical significance of the supercooling effect by plotting the deviation of the nucleation temperature @xmath149 from @xmath136 .",
    "we see that , for large values of @xmath10 , the deviation is not significant since the potential barrier disappears at a temperature not much less than the critical one . on the another hand , as soon as one lowers @xmath10 , the barrier persists to lower and lower temperatures , making the supercooling delay of the phase transition important .",

    "qualitatively , gravity - wave detectors will give us a better chance to observe the phase transition today if the latent heat energy released is large and the emission lasts a long time .",

    "these models are characterized by higher dimensional operators in the higgs sector suppressed by the strong decay constant , @xmath10 , a scale parametrically smaller than the cutoff of the strong sector .",

    "we want to show that this cancellation occurs also for smaller temperatures of order @xmath130 . indeed by working out the integrals of ( [ eqn : pottcorrections ] ) in order to isolate its imaginary part , we get @xmath285 = \\sum_{i = h,\\chi}\\theta(-m^2_i(\\phi))\\frac{n_it^4}{4\\pi^2}\\int_0^{\\frac{|m_i(\\phi)|}{t}}dx x^2\\left((4n+1)\\pi-\\sqrt{\\frac{|m_i(\\phi)|^2}{t^2}-x^2}\\right),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath198 is a positive integer which ensures that @xmath286 so that one stays on the principal sheet when taking the imaginary part of the logarithm , whose branch is assumed to lie on the negative real axis of the complex plane",
    ". we can easily show that @xmath287 as long as @xmath288 , in which case the imaginary part becomes @xmath285&=&\\sum_{i = h,\\chi}\\theta(-m^2_i(\\phi))\\frac{n_it^4}{4\\pi^2}\\int_0^{\\frac{|m_i(\\phi)|}{t}}dx x^2\\left(\\pi-\\sqrt{\\frac{|m_i(\\phi)|^2}{t^2}-x^2}\\right),\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\sum_{i = h,\\chi}\\theta(-m^2_i(\\phi))n_i\\left[-\\frac{|m_i(\\phi)|^4}{64\\pi}+\\frac{|m_i(\\phi)|^3 t}{12\\pi}\\right]\\label{eqn : impartt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and reproduces the same cancellation with ( [ eqn : impartring ] ) and ( [ eqn : impart0 ] ) as in the high temperature regime .    for completeness",
    "we now consider the case of very low temperatures .",
    "as the temperature cools down below @xmath289 , one begins needing to shift the imaginary part of the @xmath281 by multiples of @xmath290 to remain on the principal sheet of the complex plane .",
    "furthermore , from ( [ eqn : psheet ] ) we see that @xmath291 thus @xmath292 \\leq \\sum_{i = h,\\chi}\\theta(-m^2_i(\\phi))n_i\\frac{|m_i(\\phi)|^3 t}{6\\pi}\\ ] ] and we conclude that @xmath293 $ ] vanishes as @xmath37 goes to zero , as it should .",
