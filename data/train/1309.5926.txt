    "@xcite established that for many mcs their internal velocity dispersion , @xmath1 , is well correlated with the cloud size , @xmath2 , and mass , @xmath3 . since the power - law form of the correlation , @xmath4 , and the power index , @xmath5 , were similar to those of the ( * ? ? ?",

    "this seminal paper preconceived many important ideas in the field and strongly influenced its development for the past 30 years .",
    "@xcite studied 43 smaller dark clouds and confirmed the existence of significant linewidth  size and density  size correlations found earlier by larson for larger mcs .",
    "he acknowledged that two distinct interpretations of the data are possible : ( i ) the linewidth - size relation also known as larson s first law ( @xmath7 ) arises from a kolmogorov - like cascade of turbulent energy ; ( ii ) the same relation results from the tendency of clouds to reside in virial equilibrium ( @xmath8 , larson s second law ) and from the tendency of the mean cloud density to scale inversely linearly with the cloud size ( @xmath9 , larson s third law ) .",

    "@xmath16 partly because the srby87 clouds had approximately constant molecular gas surface density ( @xmath17 ) independent of their size .",
    "the surface density  size relation  another form of larson s third law  can be derived by eliminating @xmath18 from his first two relations : @xmath19 .",
    "thus any two of larson s laws imply the other , leaving open a question of which two laws , if any , are actually fundamental .    whether or not the third law simply reflects observational selection effects stemming from limitations in dynamic range of available observations is still a matter of debate @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the structure of nearby mcs by mapping the dust column density that is believed to be a robust tracer for the molecular hydrogen ( cf . * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the dust extinction maps usually have a larger ( although not much larger ) dynamic range ( typically @xmath20 ) than that feasible with simple molecular tracers .",
    "@xcite verified larson s third law ( @xmath21 ) with a very small scatter for their mcs defined with a given extinction threshold .",
    "this trivial result is determined by how the size of a cloud or clump is defined observationally and is physically insignificant ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite also demonstrated that the mass  size version ( @xmath22 ) of the third law applied within a single cloud using different thresholds does not hold , indicating that individual clouds can not be described as objects characterized by constant column density .",
    "three - dimensional numerical simulations that are free of such selection effects nevertheless reproduce a robust mass  size correlation for density structures in supersonic turbulence with a slope of @xmath23 , i.e. steeper than @xmath22 @xcite .",

    "* ) , a simple virial equilibrium - based interpretation of linewidth  size relation appealed to many in the 1980s .",
    "the central supporting observational evidence for a gravitational origin of larson s relations has been the scaling coefficient in the first law , which coincided with the predicted value for gravitationally bound clouds @xmath27 . in particular , the observed gravitational energy of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) in the outer galaxy with the total molecular mass in excess of @xmath28  m@xmath29 was found comparable to their observed kinetic energy @xcite .    since then views on this subject have remained polarized .",
    "for instance , @xcite argue that mcs are in a state of ` hierarchical and chaotic gravitational collapse ' , while @xcite believe that gmcs are ` predominantly gravitationally unbound objects ' . as some authors tend to deny the existence of a unique linewidth ",

    "* ) , others argue that it is difficult to identify the relation using samples that have too small a dynamic range .",
    "in addition , the scaling laws based on observations of different tracers may differ as they probe different density regimes and different physical structures @xcite .",
    "this persistent dualism in interpretation largely stems from the fundamentally limited nature of information that can be extracted from observations ( e.g. due to low resolution , projection effects , wide variation in the co - h@xmath15 conversion factor , active feedback in regions of massive star formation , etc . )",

    "note that the two interpretations are mutually exclusive in the presence of large - scale turbulence with the energy injection length - scale of the order of the galactic molecular disc thickness .",
    "this description of the ism turbulence is supported by the extent of the observed linewidth  size and mass  size correlations which continue up to @xmath30  pc with no sign of flattening @xcite as well as by simulations of supernova - driven ism turbulence , which suggest the integral scale of @xmath31  pc @xcite .",

    ", turbulent support in self - gravitating media is on average negative , i.e. promoting the collapse rather than resisting it @xcite .",

    "is there any direct observational evidence supporting the turbulent origin of the non - thermal velocity fluctuations in mcs ?",

    "indeed , the fact that the rate of energy transfer per unit volume in the inertial cascade , @xmath54 , is roughly the same in three different components of the cold neutral medium : in the cold hi , in mcs , and in dense molecular cores @xcite , strongly suggests that the energy propagates across scales in a universal way consistent with equation ( [ 132 ] ) .",

    "although the dispersion of @xmath55 is equally large at all scales , this result suggests that mcs traced by @xmath10co(1 - 0 ) are part of the same turbulent cascade as the atomic ism .    in the following , we shall exploit the linear scaling of the third - order moment of @xmath57 , which according to equation ( [ 132 ] ) implies a constant kinetic energy density flux within the inertial range .",
    "we shall first derive several secondary scaling laws involving the coarse - grained surface density @xmath58 , assuming that the effective kinetic energy density flux is approximately constant within the inertial range ( and neglecting gravity ) .",

    "a similar trend is recovered by @xcite in the l1448 cloud , where a fraction of self - gravitating material obtained from dendrogram analysis shows a clear dependence on scale . while most of the emission from the l1448 region is contained in large - scale ` bound ' structures , only a low fraction of smaller objects appear self - gravitating .",

    "<S> the simulations support a turbulent interpretation of larson s relations . </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation implies that : ( i ) the slopes of linewidth  size and mass  size correlations are determined by the inertial cascade ; ( ii ) none of the three larson laws is fundamental ; ( iii ) instead , if one is known , the other two follow from scale invariance of the kinetic energy transfer rate . </S>",
    "<S> it _ does not _ imply that gravity is dynamically unimportant . </S>",
    "<S> the self - similarity of structure established by the turbulence breaks in star - forming clouds due to the development of gravitational instability in the vicinity of the sonic scale . </S>",
    "<S> the instability leads to the formation of prestellar cores with the characteristic mass set by the sonic scale . </S>",
    "<S> the high - end slope of the core mass function predicted by the scaling relations is consistent with the salpeter power - law index .    </S>",
