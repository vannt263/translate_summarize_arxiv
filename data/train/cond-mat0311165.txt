    "the ground state is incompressible because an infinitesimal decrease in the area @xmath6 , which decreases @xmath9 , requires a finite energy @xmath10 to promote an electron to the next landau level .",

    "when @xmath9 is larger than @xmath0 , no gap occurs in the absence of electron  electron interactions . at very high values of the applied magnetic field , there is only one relevant energy scale in the problem , the coulomb scale @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the magnetic length . in that case",

    "when a number of charges interact with a given composite particle , the polarization effect is reduced from that caused by a single charge , because the total electric field at the position of the excitonic ion is the vector sum of contributions from all the other charges , and there is usually some cancellation .",
    "we will ignore this effect in the present work and simply use the pseudopotential @xmath101 obtained from fig .",

    "consider for a moment a system containing 12 electrons and six holes on a haldane spherical surface at monopole strength @xmath126 .",

    "note that @xmath135 holds for the quantum liquid of @xmath79 s just as it did in the case of electrons .",
    "although the @xmath79 particles have relatively long lifetimes for radiative recombination of an electron  hole pair , it seems unlikely that the laughlin condensed state of negatively charged excitons can be observed by the standard experimental techniques used in the case of condensed states of an electron liquid .",
    "one point worth noting is that the generalized cf picture of a multicomponent plasma can be thought of in terms of fictitious cf fluxes and cf charges that have different `` colors '' .",

    "are ( ii ) @xmath140 with total binding energy @xmath141 , and ( iii ) @xmath142 with total energy @xmath143 .",
    "the total energy of any state depends on the interaction energy of the constituent charged particles as well as the binding energy .",
    "the system of eighteen particles ( 12 electrons and 6 holes ) at @xmath126 is too large for us to diagonalize in terms of the electrons and holes and their interactions .",
    "however , we can obtain a reasonable approximation to the low lying energy spectrum by considering the different charge configurations denoted by ( i ) through ( iii ) each of which contains only six charged fermions .",

    "however , note that the ( ii ) and ( iii ) states predicted for @xmath153 ( at @xmath152 and 2 , respectively ) do not form separate bands in fig .",

    "this allows for a rich pl spectrum which can be used as a probe of the low lying @xmath163@xmath164 states even at very high magnetic field , where only states within the lowest landau level are of importance . because the number of valence band holes excited optically is so small , it is sufficient to study the eigenstates of a single hole interacting with the @xmath0 electrons in the quantum well .",
