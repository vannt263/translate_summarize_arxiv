    "in a quantizing magnetic field , the physics of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) at very low temperatures is controlled by electron - electron interactions which dominate over the single particle physics leading to exotic collective ground states .",
    "for example , the spin exchange energy often dominates over the single particle zeeman energy in the fractional and integer quantum hall regimes.@xcite the rich physics of the quantum hall ferromagnetism has attracted considerable interest when two spin split landau levels with different spin index ( _ _ i.e.__@xmath4 ) and orbital quantum number(@xmath3 ) are brought in coincidence.@xcite in this case , the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) may exhibit hysteretic features with a complicated phenomenology@xcite related to phase transitions at non - zero temperatures",
    ". such typical behavior of ising ferromagnetic systems(_i.e . _ with easy - axis anisotropy)@xcite can be explained in terms of domain walls @xcite or distinct symmetry - broken states@xcite .",
    "equally , the crossing of spin split landau levels with the same @xmath3 and different spin index leads to interesting physics@xcite . in this case",
    ", qhe exhibits a different phenomenology related to no finite - temperature phase transitions without hysteretic features . such typical behavior of heisenberg ferromagnetic systems ( _ i.e. _ isotropic anisotropy)@xcite leads to the existence of a non - zero electron spin gap in the energy spectrum of a 2deg under conditions of vanishing zeeman energy .",
    "this behavior has been observed in gaas - based structures in the integer quantum hall regime at @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "this could be explained as a consequence of the well established model@xcite of electron - electron exchange interaction ( at least for @xmath5 ) which forces a ferromagnetic ordering of the electronic spins at odd filling factors.@xcite therefore , any small perturbation opens the electron spin gap ( @xmath7 ) even when zeeman energy is zero .",
    "reasoning in these terms also implies that the exchange contribution to @xmath7 always dominates over the zeeman term .",
    "this is in agreement with routine experimental observations in 2degs confined in iii / v based structures which clearly show that @xmath7 deduced from activated transport data at odd filling factors always greatly exceeds the single particle zeeman energy.@xcite .",
    "in addition , electronic spins can not be treated as an isolated system but unavoidably interact with localized spins of nuclei@xcite or localized spins of substitutional magnetic ions , such us mn@xmath8.@xcite the incorporation of localized magnetic moments in diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) offers unique spin splitting engineering@xcite via the @xmath9 exchange interaction between the electron and magnetic ion spins@xcite .",
    "this can potentially be exploited to probe the spontaneous ferromagnetic order of a 2deg via @xmath7 when the electron zeeman energy is continuously tuned through zero via the @xmath2 exchange interaction with localized spins .    here",
    ", we report on the study of qhe in a n - type modulation doped cd@xmath0mn@xmath1te quantum well ( qw ) structure under conditions of vanishing zeeman energy .",
    "so far , the standard method to tune the electron g - factor through zero in semiconductor structures was to apply hydrostatic pressure@xcite .",
    "however , this method offers rather limited range of tunability of the zeeman energy and can also modify the carrier density or the mobility .",
    "the incorporation of substitutional magnetic moments such as mn@xmath8 in cdte qw structures offers an additional possibility of tuning the electron spin splitting via the @xmath9 exchange interaction between the spins of 2deg and the localized magnetic moments@xcite . in a simple approach ,",
    "the extended 2d electron and localised mn@xmath8 spins can be treated as two paramagnetic subsystems .",
    "thus , a single electron spin feels the external magnetic field and the mean field resulting from the mn@xmath8 spin polarization . due to the opposite signs of the bare zeeman and @xmath9 exchange terms in a cd@xmath10mn@xmath11te qw , the magnetic field ( @xmath12 ) dependence of the total electron zeeman energy ( @xmath13 ) results from the competition between these two contributions . at low magnetic fields where the @xmath9 exchange interaction term dominates",
    ", @xmath13 has large and positive values related to the @xmath9 exchange term .",
    "on increasing @xmath12 , the bare zeeman term increases linearly whereas the @xmath9 exchange interaction term saturates .",
    "therefore , at high magnetic fields @xmath13 decreases because of the negative contribution related to the bare zeeman term ( see left inset of figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath13 reaches zero value at a given magnetic field for which zeeman term is equal to @xmath9 exchange term what depends on the mn concentration .",
    "thus , the particular @xmath12-dependence of @xmath13 in cd@xmath10mn@xmath11te qw structures allows to study the evolution of a given quantum hall state when @xmath13 is continuously tuned from positive to negative values through zero .",
    "this can be achieved by simply tilting the plane of the 2d electron sheet with respect to the @xmath12-direction . that offers an unique opportunity to probe the ferromagnetic phenomenology of heisenberg systems when the value of @xmath13 is modulated and the sign is inverted . the clear advantage of dms systems is the wide range over which the g - factor can be continuously tuned without any changes in the mobility or carrier density .",
    "the disadvantage lies in the lower mobility ( below 200.000 @xmath14v@xmath15s@xmath15 ) of a 2deg confined in magnetic qws@xcite with respect to their iii - v non - magnetic counterparts .",
    "the experimental results presented in this work show that the condition of vanishing effective zeeman energy in cd@xmath10mn@xmath11te qws does not necessarily imply that @xmath7 is zero .",
    "we also observe that the opening or closing of the @xmath7 when @xmath16 tightly depend on the filling factor .     and",

    "thus , by rotating the sample the value of @xmath13 at a given filling factor is varied from positive to negative values passing through zero .     and @xmath17 in the vicinity of @xmath48 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the magneto - transport measurements of our sample under perpendicular magnetic fields up to @xmath49  t at @xmath18  k. a well developed landau quantization at the integer quantum hall regime is observed : well pronounced shubnikov - de haas oscillations in @xmath21 and quantized plateaus in @xmath17 . the rather broad @xmath17 plateaus associated to low filling factors ( for instance , @xmath5 and @xmath50 ) and the low 2deg mobility reveal the presence of relevant disorder in our sample . at low @xmath12 ( where @xmath51 ) , shubnikov de haas oscillations show complex beating patterns which have been discussed in detail in our previous work.@xcite at higher @xmath12 ( where @xmath52 @xmath13 ) , both @xmath21 and @xmath17 show a typical qhe for a spin polarized 2deg : resistance plateaus and minima associated with a continuous sequence of odd and even integer filling factors . however , certain @xmath21 and @xmath17 irregularities appear in the range of @xmath53  t. at these magnetic fields , the @xmath21 maxima between @xmath54 and @xmath23 is anomalously distorted so that the development of an additional minimum in @xmath21 could be envisaged around @xmath55 t. in parallel , a kink , resembling the development of quantum hall plateau , is observed in the @xmath17 trace .",
    "these anomalies have been previously related to the appearance of the @xmath56 fractional quantum hall state@xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath41-dependence of @xmath17 and @xmath17 , shown in figure [ fig2 ] , rules out such a possibility . while there is some evidence for the existence of a plateau at intermediate temperatures ( ranging 210 mk - 1.7 k ) , the feature washes out at the lowest temperatures rather than fully developing as expected for a fractional state .",
    "indeed , the value of the anomalous plateau tightly depends on temperature : whereas at the lowest temperature ( @xmath41=40 mk ) , the @xmath17 anomalous plateau almost reaches the value of @xmath57 , the value drops to 0.5@xmath57 at the highest @xmath41 ( 4.2k ) .",
    "the non - quantization of the developing plateau is a strong indication that an alternative explanation to fractional states should be sought .",
    "simultaneously , the @xmath21 maxima broadens when increasing temperature . in order to clarify",
    "if the vanishing of @xmath13 is related to these resistance anomalies , we model the @xmath12 and @xmath41-dependence of @xmath13 in our sample by assuming that :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the electron g - factor in cdte@xcite , @xmath60 is the bohr magneton , @xmath61  mev is the @xmath2 exchange interaction term between free electron and localized mn@xmath8 determined here from the low magnetic field transport measurements @xcite , @xmath62 is the modified brillouin function , and @xmath63 is the effective temperature of the mn spin subsystem@xcite considering the magnetization correction due to the antiferromagnetic mn@xmath8-mn@xmath8 interactions . in our particular sample ,",

    "characteristically for insulating systems , the gap can be determined by thermally activated transport measurements .",
    "this procedure yields reliable gap values for clean 2deg@xcite ( _ i.e. _ narrow landau level broadening ) . however , this is not the case for our 2deg as revealed by the wide @xmath17 plateaus observed in fig.[fig1 ] and the low carrier mobility .",
    "such plateau broadening can be related to the intrinsic disorder associated with ternary compounds , to the long range disorder associated with iodine donor impurities and/or with the presence of background dopants in the qw region . in a first approach , all these disorder mechanisms increase landau level broadening leading to a large number of localized states .",
    "nevertheless , thermally activated gaps obtained by @xmath41-dependence measurements in our sample may provide a qualitative evolution of @xmath7 when tuning @xmath13 at given filling factor .",
    "thus , we investigate the evolution of @xmath21 when zeeman energy vanishes at @xmath24 and @xmath28 ( insulating - like quantum hall states ) .",

    "the non - quantized @xmath17 plateau and the high - field shoulder of @xmath21 can be understood due to the floating up of @xmath31 when the spin split @xmath126 landau levels approach under vanishing zeeman energy conditions .",

    "the description of @xmath32 depends on the value of @xmath146 as can be seen in fig.[fig8 ] .",

    "when increasing @xmath146 value till @xmath154  mev , the @xmath32 reduces when @xmath31 goes through the center of the upper spin branch landau level ( see fig.[fig8 ] ) over a wide range of magnetic fields .",
    "the @xmath31 behavior with respect to spin split landau levels gives rise to broad and pronounced @xmath142 peak around @xmath68  t but with a smaller amplitude than in case of @xmath153 mev .",

    "in contrast , for larger @xmath146 values ( @xmath155  mev ) , the spin split @xmath126 landau levels have a more pronounced energetic distance leading to a significant reduction of @xmath32 when @xmath31 goes from @xmath156 towards @xmath157 .",
    "the increase of magnetic field raises the degeneracy of the landau levels pulling down @xmath31with respect to the center of the upper spin branch ( see fig.[fig8 ] ) .",
    "this is reflected in the transport properties as a transformation of the @xmath142 peak into a high field shoulder which becomes less pronounced as @xmath146 further increases ( see fig.[fig9 ] .",
    "simultaneously , the @xmath17 kink continuously increases its resistance value and become less pronounced when increasing @xmath146(see fig.[fig9 ] ) .",
    "in addition , the effect of tilting the sample can be reasonably modeled for @xmath48 by considering @xmath158  mev . as shown in figure [ fig10 ] , the simulation qualitatively reproduces our observations fairly well ( compare with fig.[fig3 ] ) : the value of the @xmath17 plateau increases with the tilt angle @xmath67 , reaching the value of the adjacent integer quantum hall plateau ( _ i.e. _ @xmath57 ) for @xmath159 . at this titled angle",
    ", the @xmath17 trace shows an unique slope while for smaller angles two different slopes can be appreciated , in good agreement with the experimental data ( see [ fig3 ] ) .",

    "at the same time the shoulder shifts to lower @xmath160 and becomes less pronounced , qualitatively in good agreement with experiments . in our simulations ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath31 depends on a single parameter which is the ratio of the interaction energy to the landau level broadening ( @xmath131/@xmath129 ) so that the determined value of @xmath146 depends on the landau level broadening used .",
    "another important limitation of the model corresponds to the description of the @xmath41-dependence of the plateau . in a first approach",
    ", we may expect that increasing temperature the number of localized states should decrease.@xcite this may therefore affect the plateau formation and also the broadening of the @xmath21 minima associated with @xmath5 as we clearly see in fig.[fig2 ] . in our calculations , changing @xmath146 should lead to similar effects which is not the case ( see fig.[fig9 ] ) .     and",
    "@xmath32 as a function of magnetic field for different tilt angles in the vicinity of @xmath48 for @xmath161  mev and @xmath18  k. ]",
    "our model qualitatively describes the @xmath17 anomaly as the result of an avoided crossing of spin split @xmath126 landau levels which slightly overlap under vanishing zeeman energy conditions for a given @xmath131/@xmath129 ratio . in the standard picture of the integer qhe",
    ", the quantization of hall plateaus is assigned to electron localization . moving away from integer filling factors , the electron density and their localization length increases .",
    "hence , free electrons become delocalized leading to the increase of @xmath17 because the plateau quantization is lost .",
    "thus , we may expect a non - quantized plateau when landau level cross under vanishing zeeman energy condition .",
    "this particular circumstance related to the mixing of localized - delocalized states at the fermi level when @xmath16 ( see fig.[fig7 ] ) originates the reentrant of an insulating phase responsible of the observation of a non - quantized plateau . under such spin landau level mixing conditions",
    ", the thermal activation determines the value of the @xmath17 as shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "reasoning in similar terms , this model also explains the appearance of the @xmath21 high field shoulder at @xmath48 .",
    "the success of our qualitative model represents an important goal which allows to predict the appearance of non - quantized plateaus each time landau level crossing and @xmath31 coincide .",
    "the important parameters which favor the observation of such resistance anomalies are @xmath131 and @xmath129 .",
    "the disorder favors the observations of such resistance phenomena : high - magnetic field @xmath21 shoulder ( instead of well pronounced peaks ) and well developed non - quantized @xmath17 plateau ( instead of delta function - like plateau reductions @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , our observations reveals that , at the temperature range studied , the crossing ( or avoided crossing ) of landau levels with the same @xmath3 and different @xmath4 index does not lead to hysteretic resistance behaviour , contrary to the case with different @xmath3 and @xmath4 indexes.@xcite     as a function of magnetic field in the vicinity of @xmath24 considering @xmath162 and @xmath163  k as described in the text . the perpendicular magnetic field for which @xmath16 ( @xmath91 ) is noted for each angle . ]",
    "although we conclude that spin landau levels avoid to cross in both the @xmath48 and @xmath114 case , the corresponding @xmath21 resistance maxima behave quite differently when @xmath13 is varied : high field shoulder disappearing at @xmath48 and no changes at @xmath114 .",
    "we think , this  asymmetry ",
    "results from the fact that partial overlap of spin landau levels affects the position of @xmath31 in a different way depending on whether @xmath31 is located in the vicinity of the upper or of the lower spin level .",
    "our reasoning is schematically illustrated in fig.[fig7 ] .",
    "the situation when @xmath31 is in the vicinity of the upper spin level , which , for example , corresponds to the case of a 2deg at @xmath48 , is considered in fig.[fig7](a ) . in fig.[fig7](b ) , @xmath31 is in the vicinity of the lower spin level which , for example , illustrates the @xmath114 case . in the left side panel of fig.[fig7 ]",
    "we consider well separated spin levels and the condition at which the maximum in the @xmath21 should occur ( @xmath31 located exactly at the center of the corresponding landau level ) . let us now imagine that we increase the magnetic field but at the same time the spin levels approach leading to a partial overlap .",
    "the primary effect of the increase of the magnetic field is to increase the landau level degeneracy and therefore to lower @xmath31 with respect to the center of the corresponding spin landau level .",
    "this simply translates into a decrease of the corresponding resistance by assuming that @xmath164 ) .",
    "however , as shown in fig.[fig7 ] , the position of @xmath31 ( with respect to the center of the corresponding spin landau level ) is also affected by the increasing overlap of the spin levels .",
    "we note that the energy level overlap leads to the decrease of @xmath30 available below the center of the upper spin level and to the increase of @xmath30 below the center of the lower level .",
    "therefore , increasing the overlap between spin levels we push @xmath31 up if it is in the vicinity of the upper spin level and push it down if it is in the vicinity of the lower spin branch .",
    "we expect that the additional `` overlap induced '' downwards shift of @xmath31 may somehow speed up the decay of the corresponding @xmath21 peak , but the effect of `` overlap induced upwards shift '' of @xmath31 may have much more pronounced consequences on the observed shape of the corresponding @xmath21 maxima .",
    "therefore , we may qualitatively understand the effect of the broadening of the @xmath48 resistance maximum observed on the high field side when separation between spin landau levels becomes small .",
    "even more severe distortions of this resistance peak could be expected , for example , the situation when @xmath31 crosses twice the center of the same spin level and therefore the observation of the splitting of the @xmath48 peak should be , in principle , possible .",
    "we show in the next section that our qualitative considerations are confirmed by a more quantitative approach to simulate numerically our experimental results .     as a function of magnetic field in the vicinity of @xmath165=5 considering @xmath166  mev and @xmath163  k as described in the text .",
    "the perpendicular magnetic field for which @xmath16 ( @xmath91 ) is noted for each plot . ]",
    "we now turn to the discussion of the shape of the @xmath21 traces obtained as the effective zeeman energy is swept through zero in the range @xmath167 shown in fig.[fig5](a ) .",
    "we know that the gap at @xmath24 and @xmath114 remains open with a @xmath158  mev .",
    "the doubling of the resistance peak at @xmath26 under conditions of vanishing zeeman energy suggests that @xmath7 closes ( _ i.e. _ @xmath168 ) .",
    "it is clear that there is a strong filling factor dependence of @xmath131 which rapidly changes from zero to finite values . a rapid opening of @xmath7 is well known in gaas based 2deg s and",
    "is generally explained in terms of the exchange energy which is proportional to the characteristic coulomb energy and proportional to the spin polarization of the system . since , for broadened landau levels , the spin polarization depends on the size of @xmath7 a positive feedback occurs and the onset of spin splitting is generally very abrupt .",
    "this can be modeled but requires that the gap and spin polarization be calculated self - consistently .",
    "we make the simplistic approximation that the residual gap depends only on the coulomb energy so that @xmath169 .",
    "the calculated @xmath142 as a function of perpendicular magnetic field for different tilt angles and @xmath18  k ( required to calculate @xmath13 ) are shown in fig.[fig11 ] .",
    "given the simplicity of the model used the agreement with the measured resistance ( see fig.[fig5](a ) ) is reasonably good .",
    "as @xmath13 passes through zero the peak around @xmath170 increases in amplitude and shifts to higher fields . to complete our simulations , we consider @xmath21 around @xmath25 and show that it is possible to roughly reproduce the experimental results ( see fig.5.(b ) ) .",
    "assuming @xmath153 and @xmath18  k , our numerical simulations support the qualitative description of the experimental data concluding that spin landau levels cross ( _ i.e. _ perfect spin landau level overlap ) when @xmath16 leading to @xmath21 maxima , as shown in figure [ fig12 ] .",
    "we have studied the evolution of quantum hall states under conditions of vanishing zeeman energy .",
    "the experimental results presented here show that the condition of vanishing effective zeeman energy does not necessarily imply the closing of the spin gap .",
    "we observe that the opening or closing of the spin gap is a function of the filling factor .",
    "thus , @xmath101 remains closed for @xmath25 and @xmath117 and opened for @xmath171 and @xmath29 at the temperature studied ( t=1.7 k ) .",
    "moreover , the experimental procedure allows the investigation of quantum hall states under vanishing zeeman energy conditions not only for insulating quantum hall states ( _ i.e. _ @xmath24 and @xmath28 ) but also for metallic states in the vicinity of @xmath48 , @xmath27 and @xmath117 .",
    "a phenomenological model based on an avoided crossing between the two spin split components of the corresponding landau level qualitatively reproduce the @xmath21 and @xmath17 measurements at different conditions .",
    "thus , we show that the mixing of localized and delocalized states under avoided landau level crossing conditions leads to the appearance of a non - quantized plateau in the @xmath17 .",
