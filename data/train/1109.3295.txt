    "microlensing can be used to probe the distributions of binary companions of galactic stars as functions of mass ratio and separation , which provide important observational constraints on theories of star formation .",
    "being sensitive to low - mass companions that are difficult to be detected by other methods , microlensing enables to make complete distributions down to the low mass limit of binary companions @xcite .    despite the importance",
    ", the progress of this application of microlensing to the statistical analysis of binaries has been stagnant .",
    "there are two main reasons for this .",
    "the first reason arises due to the difficulties in estimating the detection efficiency of binary lenses .",
    "previously , lensing events caused by binary lenses were mainly detected through accidental detections of sudden rises and falls of the source flux resulting from source crossings over caustics formed by binary lenses , e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the caustics represent the positions on the source plane at which the lensing magnification of a point source becomes infinite . for binary events detected through this channel , it is difficult to estimate the detection efficiency due to the haphazard nature of caustic crossings .",
    "the second reason is that microlensing is mainly sensitive to binaries distributed over a narrow range of separations .",
    "the probability of caustic crossings increases with the increase of the caustic size .",
    "the caustic size becomes maximum when the separation between the lens components is of order the einstein radius , @xmath2 , and decreases rapidly with the increase or decrease of the separation from @xmath2 . as a result ,",
    "the majority of microlensing binaries have separations distributed within a small range .",
    "this limits especially the study of the distribution of binary separations .",
    "however , under the current observational strategy of microlensing experiments focusing on planet detections , a significant fraction of binary events are detected through a new channel of high - magnification events .",
    "for the detections of short - duration planetary signals in lensing light curves , planetary lensing experiments are being conducted in survey and follow - up mode , where alerts of ongoing events are issued by survey experiments and intensive observations of these events are conducted by follow - up experiments . in this mode ,",
    "high - magnification events are the most important targets for follow - up observations because the source trajectories of these events always pass close to the central perturbation region induced by the planet and thus the efficiency of planet detections is very high @xcite . in addition",
    ", the time of the perturbation can be predicted in advance and thus intensive follow - up can be prepared .",
    "this leads to an observational strategy of intensively monitoring all high - magnification events regardless of whether they show signals of planets .",
    "in addition to planets , high - magnification events are sensitive to binaries as well , especially those with separations substantially smaller ( close binaries ) or larger ( wide binaries ) than the einstein radius",
    ". for close binaries , there exist three caustics where one is formed around the center of mass of the binary and the other two are located away from the barycenter . for wide binaries , on the other hand , there exist two caustics each of which is located adjacent to the individual lens components .",
    "then , high - magnification events resulting from the source trajectories passing either close to the center of mass of a close binary or one of the components of a wide binary are sensitive to binaries .",
    "the high sensitivity to close and wide binaries combined with the strategy of monitoring all high - magnification events imply that binary events detected through the high - magnification channel are important for the construction of an unbiased sample of binaries with a wider range of separations and thus for the statistical studies of binaries @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the light curves of 8 binary microlensing events detected through the high - magnification channel during the seasons from 2007 to 2010 .",
    "we search for the solutions of binary lensing parameters by conducting modeling of the light curves .",
    "we discuss the characteristics of the binaries .",
    "all 8 tested events analyzed in this work were detected toward the galactic bulge direction . in table 1 , we list the coordinates of the events .",
    "each event is designated first by the microlensing group who first discovered the event and then followed by the year when the event was discovered .",
    "if an event is discovered independently by two different groups , they are named separately .",
    "for example , the event ogle-2008-blg-510/moa-2008-blg-368 was discovered by both ogle and moa groups in 2008 . for all events ,",
    "the peak magnifications are high and thus they are issued as important targets for follow - up observations by the moa @xcite and ogle @xcite survey experiments . as a result , the peaks of the light curves were densely covered by follow - up observations including the @xmath3fun @xcite , planet @xcite , robonet @xcite , and mindstep @xcite . in table 2",
    ", we list the survey and follow - up groups who participated in the observation of the individual events . in table 3 , we also list the telescopes used for observations along with their locations .",
    "the photometry of the data was conducted by using the codes developed by the individual groups .",
    "for some events , we re - reduced data based on the image subtraction method to ensure better photometry .",
    "the error bars of the data sets were rescaled so that @xmath4 becomes unity for the data set of each observatory where @xmath5 is computed based on the best - fit model .    in figure 1",
    " 8 , we present the light curves of the individual events . for all events ,",
    "the common feature of the light curves is that most of the light curve is consistent with the standard single - lens light curve @xcite and the perturbation is confined in a narrow region around the peak .",
    "for the light curve of each event , we search for solutions of lensing parameters in the space encompassing both stellar and planetary companions .",
    "the light curve of a binary - lens event is characterized by 6 basic parameters .",
    "the first 3 parameters are related to the geometry of the lens - source approach .",
    "they are the einstein time scale , @xmath6 , the time of the closest lens - source approach , @xmath7 , and the lens source separation at that moment , @xmath8 .",
    "the other 3 parameters are related to the binarity of the lens .",
    "these parameters are the mass ratio between the lens components , @xmath9 , the projected separation in units of the einstein radius , @xmath10 , and the angle between the source trajectory and the binary axis , @xmath11 . for all tested events ,",
    "the perturbations exhibit features caused either by crossings over or approaches close to caustics and thus it is required to consider the modification of magnifications caused by the finite - source effect during the perturbation .",
    "this requires to include an additional parameter of the normalized source radius , @xmath12 , which is related to the angular source radius , @xmath13 , and the einstein radius by @xmath14 .    for each event",
    ", we search for the solution of the best - fit parameters by minimizing @xmath5 in the parameter space .",
    "we do this by dividing the parameters into two categories . for the parameters in the first category ,",
    "grid searches are conducted . for the remaining parameters in the second category",
    "are searched by using a downhill approach .",
    "we choose @xmath10 , @xmath9 , and @xmath11 as the grid parameters because these parameters are related to the features of lensing light curves in a complicated pattern while the other parameters are more directly related to the features of the light curve . for the @xmath5 minimization",
    ", we use a markov chain monte carlo method .",
    "brute - force search over the space of the grid parameters is needed in order to investigate possible local minima of degenerate solutions .",
    "this is important because it is known that there exists a pair of close / wide solution for binary - lens events , especially for binaries with separations substantially smaller or larger than the einstein radius @xcite .",
    "once local minima are identified , we check all of them by gradually narrowing down the grid parameter space . when the space is sufficiently confined , we allow the grid parameters to vary in order to pin down the exact location of the solution .",
    "computation of magnifications affected by the finite - source effect is based on the ray - shooting method @xcite . in this numerical method",
    ", rays are uniformly shot from the image plane , bent according to the lens equation , and land on the source plane .",
    "then , the finite magnification is computed by comparing the number densities of rays on the image and source planes .",
    "this method requires heavy computation because a large number of rays are needed for accurate magnification computation .",
    "we accelerate the computation by using two major methods .",
    "the first method is applying the `` map making '' method @xcite . in this method ,",
    "a map for a given set of @xmath15 is used to produce numerous light curves resulting from different source trajectories instead of shooting rays all over again .",
    "the second method is applying the semi - analytic hexadecapole approximation @xcite for the finite magnification computation when the source is not very close to the caustic .    in computing finite magnifications",
    ", we consider the effect of limb - darkening of the source star surface by modeling the surface brightness by @xmath16 } } \\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the linear limb - darkening coefficient , @xmath18 is the flux from the source star , and @xmath19 is the angle between the line of sight toward the source star and the normal to the source star s surface .",
    "we choose the coefficients from @xcite , where the source type is determined from the location of the source star on the color - magnitude diagram . in table",
    "[ table : four ] , we present the coefficients of the individual events .",
    "in addition to the modeling based on standard binary - lensing parameters , we conduct modeling considering the second - order effects on the light curve . the first effect is the `` parallax effect '' that is caused by the change of the observer position induced by the orbital motion of the earth around the sun @xcite . the second effect is the `` orbital effect '' caused by the change of the lens position induced by the orbital motion of the lens @xcite .",
    "measurement of the parallax effect is important because it allows to determine the physical parameters of the lens system @xcite . detecting the orbital effect",
    "is important because it can help to characterize the orbital parameters of the lens system .",
    "in table 5 , we present the best - fit parameters found from modeling . for each event",
    ", we present the pair of close and wide binary solutions in order to show the severity of the degeneracy",
    ". the best - fit light curves of the individual events are overplotted on the data in figure 1  8 . in figure",
    "[ fig : nine ] , we also present the geometry of the lens systems . for each event",
    ", we present two sets of geometry corresponding to the close ( left panel ) and wide ( right panel ) binary solutions . in each panel ,",
    "the big and small dots represent the locations of the binary lens components with heavier and lighter masses , respectively .",
    "the closed figure with cusps represents the caustic and the straight line with an arrow represents the source trajectory with respect to the caustic .",
    "the empty circle near the tip of the arrow on the source trajectory represents the source size .",
    "the dashed circle represents the einstein ring . for the close binary",
    ", there exists a single einstein ring whose radius corresponds to the total mass of the binary . for the wide binary , on the other hand ,",
    "there exist two rings with radii corresponding to the masses of the individual lens components .",
    "the small panel on the right side of each main panel shows the enlargement of the region around the caustic .",
    "we find that the perturbations of the events moa-2008-blg-159 , moa-2009-blg-408 , moa-2010-blg-349 , and moa-2010-blg-546 were produced by the source star s crossing over the central caustic . for the events",
    "moa-2007-blg-146 , ogle-2008-blg-510/moa-2008-blg369 , moa-2010-blg-266 , and moa-2010-blg-406 , on the other hand , the perturbations were produced by the approach of the source trajectory close to one of the cusps of the central caustic .",
    "we find that the modeling including the parallax and orbital effects does not yield solutions with statistically significant @xmath5 improvement .",
    "considering that the range of the time scales of the events is @xmath20 , we judge that the difficulties in detecting the second - order effects are due to the short time scales of the events . since the lens parallaxes are not measured , we are not able to determine the physical parameters of lenses . however , for 5 events we are able to measure the einstein radii , which is another quantity to constrain the physical lens parameters . the einstein radius is measured from the deviation of the light curve caused by the finite - source effect . by detecting the deviation ,",
    "the normalized source radius @xmath12 is measured from modeling . with the additional information of the source radius , which is obtained from the location of the source star on the color - magnitude diagram of stars in the field around the source star ,",
    "the einstein radius is determined as @xmath21 @xcite . with the measured einstein radius ,",
    "the relative lens - source proper motion is determined by @xmath22 .",
    "the values of the measured einstein radii and the proper motions are presented in table [ table : five ] . among the 5 events for which the einstein radius is measured , 4 events are caustic - crossing events . for the case of moa-2007-blg-146 , the center of the source star did not cross the caustic but the edge of the source passed over the caustic and thus the einstein radius was measurable .",
    "it is known that central perturbations , which are the common features for all analyzed events , can be produced either by planetary companions or binaries @xcite .",
    "we find that the planet / binary degeneracy is easily distinguished and the binary origin can be firmly identified .",
    "the range of the mass ratios is @xmath23 .",
    ", the value of the mass ratio @xmath24 represents the case where the source trajectory approaches the lighter component of the binary .",
    "] we note that the event ogle-2008-blg-510/moa-2008-blg-369 is caused by a binary with a low - mass companion .",
    "although the absolute value of the lens mass can not be determined , the measured mass ratio @xmath1 makes the companion of the binary a brown - dwarf candidate considering that the time scale of the event @xmath25 days is a typical one for galactic bulge events caused by low - mass stars .",
    "therefore , this event demonstrates that microlensing is a useful tool to study low - mass binary companions including brown dwarfs . by the time of completing this paper , we learned that @xcite released the result of analysis for ogle-2008-blg-510/moa-2008-blg-369 .",
    "their result is very consistent with ours and stated the possibility of the brown dwarf companion .",
    "although the binary nature of the lenses is clearly identified , it is found that the degeneracy between the close and wide binary solutions is severe for some events .",
    "the close / wide binary degeneracy , which results from a symmetry in the lens equation , was first mentioned by @xcite and further investigated by @xcite .",
    "the events for which the degeneracy can not be distinguished with a @xmath0 confidence level include ogle-2008-blg-510/moa-2008-blg-369 , moa-2009-blg-408 , and moa-2010-blg-546 .",
    "the severity of the degeneracy and the correspondence in the lens - system geometry between the pairs of degenerate solutions can be seen from the comparison of the geometry of the lens system at the time of perturbation . as predicted by theoretical studies , the close",
    "/ wide degeneracy is caused by the similarity of the shape between the caustics of the close and wide binaries the caustic shape results from the combination of the projected separation and mass ratio .",
    "to see how the severity of the degeneracy depends on these parameters , we plot the locations of the degenerate solutions in the parameter space of @xmath10 and @xmath9 in figure [ fig : ten ] . in the plot , the filled dots denote that the degeneracy is resolved at the @xmath0 confidence level and the empty dots symbolize that the degeneracy is not resolved .",
    "the area encompassed by dashed lines represents the region within which the lens forms a single merged large caustic ( resonant caustic ) . from the plot",
    ", it is found that the degeneracy becomes severe as the binary separation is located well away from the range of resonant caustics .",
    "therefore , the degeneracy would be an important obstacle in studying binary distributions for binaries with very close or wide separations .",
    "we conducted modeling of light curves of 8 binary lensing events detected through the high - magnification channel during 2007  2010 seasons .",
    "we found that the binary / planet degeneracy of the central perturbations were easily distinguished .",
    "however , the degeneracy between the close and wide binary solutions could not be resolved with confidence for some of the events .",
    "we confirmed the theoretic prediction that the degeneracy becomes severe for binaries with separations substantially smaller or wider than the einstein radius and thus the close / wide degeneracy would be an important obstacle in the studies of binary distributions .",
    "for one of the events , the measured mass ratio is in the range of a brown dwarf , demonstrating that microlensing is a useful tool to study low - mass binary companions .",
    "although it is difficult to draw meaningful statistical properties of binaries based on the handful events analyzed in this work , it is expected that the microlensing use of binary statistics would expand .",
    "one way for this improvement is the removal of human intervention in the selection process of a follow - up campaign .",
    "an example of this effort is the signalmen anomaly detector achieved by the artemis system @xcite .",
    "another way is conducting high - cadence surveys to dispense with follow - up observations .",
    "recently , the ogle group significantly increased the observational cadence by upgrading its camera with a wider field of view to the level of being able to detect short planetary perturbations by the survey itself . the korea microlensing telescope network ( kmtnet )",
    "is a planned survey experiment that will achieve  10 minute sampling of all lensing events by using a network of 1.6 m telescopes to be located in three different continents in the southern hemisphere with wide - field cameras .",
    "these new type surveys will enable not only to densely cover events but also to significantly increase the number of events in binary samples .",
    "being able to detect and densely cover binary events without human intervention combined with the increased number of events will enable microlensing to become a useful method to study binary statistics .    even with the increase of the number of events and the improvement of the process of obtaining samples , it is still an important issue to resolve the close / wide degeneracy .",
    "@xcite proposed that astrometric observation of the centroid motion of a lensed star by using a high - resolution instrument makes it possible to resolve the ambiguity of the photometric binary - lens fit for most accidentally degenerate cases .",
    "however , it is found that the close / wide binary degeneracy is so severe that it causes the image centroids of the wide and close solutions to follow a similar pattern of motion although the motions of the image centroid for the two degenerate cases are displaced from one another long after the event and thus the degeneracy can eventually be resolvable @xcite .",
    "in addition , this method requires space - based astrometric instrument and thus can not be applicable to events being detected by current lensing experiments .",
    "a class of events for which the degeneracy can be photometrically resolved are repeating events where the source trajectory passes both the central perturbation region of one of the binary components and the effective lensing region of the other binary component , e.g. ogle-2009-blg-092/moa-2009-blg-137 @xcite .",
    "however , this method can be applicable to a small fraction of events . therefore ,",
    "devising a general method resolving this degeneracy would be crucial for the statistical binary studies of microlensing binaries .",
