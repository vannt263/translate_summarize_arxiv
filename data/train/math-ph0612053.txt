    "the quartic harmonic oscillator potential , @xmath4 , is used in field theory to model the spontaneous breaking of symmetry .",
    "it is evident that there is a great deal of physics that depends on the precise knowledge of the dynamics of the coulomb potential with various polynomial interactions .    over the years",
    ", several approaches have been developed to study some special cases of this problem ( for a recent review see ref .",

    "we calculate the green s function of the non - relativistic quantum hamiltonian with a coulomb plus polynomial potential .",
    "the green s function of polynomial potentials on the harmonic oscillator basis has been calculated before @xcite .",
    "the use of the coulomb - sturmian basis will allow us to incorporate the coulomb potential .",
    "if we know the green s operator , then we have complete knowledge of the physical system .",
    "for example , the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian coincide with the poles of the green s operator .",
    "the corresponding eigenvectors can be determined from the relation @xmath7 where @xmath8 encircles the eigenvalue @xmath9 in a counterclockwise direction without incorporating other poles .    in our previous works , refs .",
    "@xcite , the coulomb green s operator was calculated in the coulomb - sturmian basis . in this basis",

    "we calculate the infinite band matrix representation of the hamiltonian . in section",
    "iv we derive the matrix continued fraction for the green s operator . some applications are considered in section v. first , to demonstrate the power of the method we show an analytically known case , the harmonic oscillator in two and three dimensions .",

    "the cs functions form a basis . with @xmath26",
    ", we have the orthogonality @xmath27 and the completeness relations @xmath28",
    "we consider the hamiltonian @xmath29 on the cs basis .    by utilizing the relations @xmath30 and @xmath31 we can easily calculate the overlap of the cs states @xmath32 then starting form eq .",

    "( [ orthog ] ) , ( [ overlap ] ) and ( [ h0me ] ) it follows that the hamiltonian @xmath34 is tridiagonal on the cs basis .    by further utilizing eqs .",
    "( [ lrec ] ) and ( [ lagint ] ) we can also derive the following matrix elements @xmath35 and @xmath36   & \\textrm{for}~~n'=n~ , \\\\   -\\frac { \\displaystyle 3 } { \\displaystyle 8 b^{3 } } \\left [     ( 4n'+2l)(n'+2l+2)+(n'-1)(n'-2 )   \\right ]   \\sqrt{n'(n'+2l+1 ) } & \\textrm{for}~~ n'=n+1~ , \\\\   \\frac { \\displaystyle 3 } { \\displaystyle 8b^{3 } } ( 2n'+2l)\\sqrt{n'(n'-1)(n'+2l+1)(n'+2l ) } & \\textrm{for}~~ n'=n+2~ , \\\\",

    "if @xmath6 is finite , the hamiltonian is an infinite symmetric band matrix , if @xmath39 , it is a pentadiagonal , if @xmath40 it is a septadiagonal band matrix .",
    "the green s operator @xmath41 is formally defined by the equation @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath11 is a complex number . on the cs basis , this takes the form @xmath44    now the operator @xmath45 has an infinite symmetric band - matrix structure .",
    "an infinite symmetric band matrix can always be considered as a block - tridiagonal or block - jacobi - matrix .",

( [ gdefm ] ) looks like @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are @xmath13 block matrices , and the @xmath49 s and @xmath50 s are @xmath13 unit and null matrices , respectively .    just knowing the @xmath51 upper left corner of the full green s matrix is sufficient to determine physical quantities .",

    "for @xmath62 an extra block matrix @xmath63 outside the truncated subspace is needed : @xmath64 we can formally eliminate this block by writing @xmath65 g_{n , n ' } =   \\delta_{n , m}~. \\end{split}\\ ] ] this formal elimination of the elements outside of @xmath53 amounts to modifying the @xmath66 block of @xmath52 .",
    "we can calculate @xmath67 from another relation : @xmath68 by introducing the notation @xmath69 eq .",

    "therefore , we can write eq .",
    "( [ eq : gf - eq-2solven2 ] ) in the form @xmath73 i.e.  the modified @xmath51 block - jacobi matrix is the inverse of @xmath53 @xmath74    the numerical evaluation of matrix continued fractions is very similar to those of ordinary continued fractions . in backward evaluation",
    "we start at some @xmath75 term , neglect the higher terms , and evaluate ( [ cncf ] ) from the inside out .",
    "if a new approximant with larger @xmath76 is needed , we have to start the whole process again . on the other hand ,",
    "the backward evaluation is simple and provides very accurate results .",
    "to demonstrate the power of this method , we take first the harmonic oscillator @xmath77 in two and three dimensions . this hamiltonian has a septadiagonal structure on the cs basis , which can be considered as a block - jacobi matrix with @xmath78 blocks .",
    "in our numerical example we take @xmath79 and roll up the continued fraction up to the first block and calculate the determinant of a @xmath80 matrix .",
    "figure 1 shows the poles of @xmath81 as function of the cs parameter @xmath82 .",
    "we took @xmath83 , which implies @xmath84 for @xmath85 and @xmath86 for @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "it can be seen that even a @xmath78 green s matrix provides all the eigenvalues of ( [ hoh ] ) .",
    "they agree with the exact results @xmath88 up to machine accuracy and the results are independent of the choice for the parameter @xmath82 of the cs basis .    .",
