    "the spectacular observations of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in atomic vapors reported last year @xcite have opened up new avenues of research into the physical properties and nature of bose - condensed systems .",
    "recent experimental developments include reports of a new trap capable of holding larger number of atoms and measurements of the condensate fraction and mean - field energy @xcite , non - direct observation of the development of the condensate @xcite , measurements of the collective oscillations of the condensate @xcite-@xcite , and an output coupler for an atomic bose - einstein condensate @xcite .",
    "the measurements of the collective excitations have been found to be in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions from mean - field theory for condensate fractions near unity @xcite-@xcite .",
    "such detailed studies of the collective excitations opens the door to investigating superfluid effects in atomic becs , and in particular the general relation between bec and superfluidity ( see , for example , the article by huang in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the intereference of two becs formed in small atomic samples composed of @xmath0 atoms , typical of current experiments .",
    "our motivation for this theoretical investigation is that we previously showed that in small atomic samples the macroscopic wave function exhibits collapses and revivals , the first collapse occuring on a few seconds time scale @xcite . in that work",
    "the notion of bose broken symmetry @xcite was invoked and the quantum state of the condensate was taken as a wave packet composed of states of fixed number of particles , so that , according to the uncertainty relationship between particle number and phase , the condensate phase can become well defined .",
    "the collapse of the macroscopic wave function arises from the fact that , due to many - body interactions , the chemical potential is different for each particle number present in the wave packet , and the revivals are a direct consequence of the discreteness of the particle number @xcite .",
    "based on this theory one would naively expect that if two becs are interfered the visibility of the interference pattern should also exhibit the collapses and revivals , hence providing a direct experimental signature of the effect .",
    "however , before jumping to conclusions it is important to note that the notion of bose broken symmetry is only strictly applicable in the thermodynamic limit , where the system size and the number of particles tend to infinity with the density held constant , so that another approach should be utilized to verify the predicted collapse and revivals .",
    "such an approach , freed from the thermodynamic limit and bose broken symmetry arguments , has emerged in the last year @xcite-@xcite .",
    "javanainen and yoo @xcite first showed that an interference pattern between two condensates , and hence a relative phase between the two condensates , could arise from an explicit model of atomic detections : as atomic detections are performed an uncertainty in the number of atoms in each condensate is built up , since we do nt know which condensate any atom is removed from .",
    "the uncertainty relationship between the relative atom number of the condendates and the relative phase then allows a well defined relative phase to emerge .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : section ii gives the basic theory for bec in a trapped gas of atoms as described by the gross - pitaevskii equation and within the thomas - fermi approximation .",

    "vi gives our summary and conclusions .",
    "in this section we introduce the second quantized hamiltonian for bec in a trapped gas of atoms , and then discuss the gross - pitaevskii equation for the macroscopic wave function and the thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "although these topics are amply covered elsewhere we include them for completeness and to clarify our notation .",
    "our starting point is the second quantized hamiltonian for a system of bosonic atoms confined in a trap potential @xcite @xmath1 ,   \\label{qham}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the heisenberg picture field operators which annihilate and create atoms at position @xmath4 , and obey the equal - time commutation relation @xmath5 = \\delta ( { \\bf r}-{\\bf % r}^{\\prime } ) $ ] appropriate to bosons , the ( single - particle ) trap potential is taken of the form @xcite @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the transverse position coordinate assuming cylindrical symmetry of the trap potential in the transverse plane , and @xmath8 the longitudinal coordinate , @xmath9 is the atomic mass , @xmath10 the transverse angular frequency of the trap , @xmath11 is the ratio of the longitudinal to transverse frequencies , and @xmath12 measures the strength of the two - body interaction , @xmath13 being the s - wave scattering length .",
    "here we consider a repulsive interaction so that @xmath14 .      here",
    "we consider the standard treatment of the condensate in a bose gas @xcite . at zero temperature , and for a weakly interacting gas , the particles may be assumed to be predominantly in the condensate .",
    "the assumption of zero temperature is not too restrictive since atomic condensates can be prepared with condensate fractions close to unity @xcite .",

    "then proceeding in the usual manner @xcite from the schrdinger equation ( [ schroeq ] ) we obtain the self - consistent nonlinear schrdinger equation or gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite generalized to include the magneto - optical harmonic trap @xcite @xmath20 \\psi _ { n } ,    \\label{gpeq}\\ ] ] we are interested in the ground state solution of this equation for which we set @xmath21 , giving the stationary gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath22\\phi _ { n } ,   \\label{groundeq}\\ ] ] where the macroscopic wave function @xmath23 for the @xmath16-particle system is normalized to unity .",

    "the stationary gross - pitaevskii equation follows from the variational principle @xmath27 , and using this we find the further exact result @xmath28 which can be rearranged to yield @xmath29 which we shall use below .",

    "we follow baym and pethick @xcite and use the thomas - fermi approximation for the macroscopic wave function , in which the kinetic energy term in the stationary gross - pitaevskii equation is neglected .",
    "this yields the approximate macroscopic wave function @xmath31 when the argument of the square root is greater than or equal to zero , zero otherwise . requiring that the macroscopic wave function be normalized to unity yields the expression for the chemical potential @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the characteristic transverse length scale of the linear potential .",

    "following baym and pethick @xcite we find that @xmath37 which should be much less than unity for the thomas - fermi approximation to apply . in the first four columns of table i we show the values of the parameters for some current experiments with a positive scattering length , and the fifth column",

    "( [ overlap1 ] ) giving @xmath39 a result we shall use later .",
    "in this section we investigate quantum interference between two becs using the notion of bose broken gauge symmetry @xcite . according to this notion",
    "the macroscopic wave function for each condensate attains a fixed but arbitrary phase as a result of the spontaneous breaking of u(1 ) gauge symmetry during the condensation process .",
    "the u(1 ) gauge symmetry is associated with particle number conservation , so that in the condensed system the particle number is not fixed .",
    "then , as a result of the number - phase uncertainty relationship @xmath40 , the phase @xmath41 need not be indeterminate , and interference between two becs is possible . here",
    "we employ a description of the condensate state vector as a wavepacket of states of fixed particle number",
    "n in the condensate to apply the notion of bose broken gauge symmetry .",
    "in contrast , in section [ section3 ] we will show atomic detections establish a coherent wavepacket without the need to build in bose broken symmetry from the outset .",
    "the definition of the macroscopic wave function given in the last section is rigorous in the thermodynamic limit @xcite . to investigate the case of a small condensate ,",
    "say a few thousand atoms , we employ a wavepacket description .",
    "in particular , the wavepacket description is intended to reflect the quantum coherence of the condensate for measurement times short compared to relaxation times @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for measurements performed over times long compared to relaxation times the quantum coherence of the condensate is destroyed and the macroscopic wave function vanishes .    here",
    "we employ a wavepacket composed of states of fixed number of particles @xmath42 in the condensate , with expansion coefficients @xmath43 , hence retaining quantum coherence .",
    "the present description of bec , due to barnett et .",
    "@xcite , is therefore different from the conventional @xmath41-ensemble which employs a wave - packet of states corresponding to different total number of particles , condensate plus non - condensate , and is generally only applicable in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "a coherent state with @xmath44 suggests itself , but the states associated with bec do not generally possess such complete phase - coherence @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a pure state description of the condensate may be rendered plausible as follows : below the einstein condensation temperature the many - body ground state of the system becomes macroscopically occupied , yielding a condensate which should be considered an open quantum system in contact via many - body interactions with the environment or reservoir composed of the non - condensate atoms .",
    "it is known from the work of zurek et .",
    "@xcite and gallis @xcite , that for a system , in their case a harmonic oscillator , in interaction with an environment certain pure states show considerable stability against loss of quantum coherence , and that in the weak coupling limit the pure states of maximal stability are the coherent states .",
    "thus , the quantum coherence of the condensate may be reasonably represented by a pure state , though perhaps not precisely a coherent state since weak coupling may not hold .",
    "this argument does not depend on the size of the system , except that the non - condensate atoms may be viewed as a reservoir , and the conclusions therefore apply even for small condensates far removed from the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we further assume that the particle number distribution @xmath45 is sharply peaked with variance @xmath46 around a mean particle number @xmath47 . as a concrete example we take a poissonian distribution for which @xmath48 , which is reasonable since the number distribution @xmath49 may not be so correlated . under these conditions",
    "we may expand the chemical potential @xmath25 around the mean number @xmath50 in a taylor series @xmath51 where @xmath52 if we compute the ratio of the third term to the second term in this expansion for @xmath53 , then we find that the magnitude of this ratio varies as @xmath54 .",
    "thus , even for a low particle number @xmath55 the second term in the expansion is the dominant correction . in the remainder of this paper we shall",
    "therefore only retain the first two terms in the above expansion .",
    "we are now equipped to construct the wavepacket for the condensate state vector , which we write as @xmath56 where the exponential contains the term @xmath57 since there are @xmath16 particles each of chemical potential @xmath25 , the operator @xmath58 creates particles with distribution @xmath59 @xcite , with @xmath60=1 $ ] , and @xmath61 is the vacuum state .",
    "the approximations employed in eq .",
    "( [ wave_func ] ) are tantamount to the hartree approximation . in general",
    "the schrdinger field annihilation operator can be written as a mode expansion over single - particle states as @xmath62 where @xmath63 are a complete orthonormal basis set . here in the last line we have chosen @xmath64 as one member of the complete orthonormal set , and",
    "identified @xmath65 .",
    "then by construction the first term in the mode expansion acts only on the condensate state vector , whereas the second term @xmath66 accounts for the non - condensate atoms .",
    "the state vector ( [ wave_func ] ) may be used to calculate quantum expectation values of the condensate . of interest to us here are the one - particle reduced density matrix representing the condensate @xmath67 and the macroscopic wave function @xmath68 where @xmath69 ,   \\label{foft}\\ ] ] and @xmath70 is the net chemical potential of the condensate . using eq .",
    "( [ chempot ] ) for the chemical potential @xmath30 in the thomas - fermi approximation we obtain @xmath71 , and the net chemical potential @xmath72 is equal to the mean energy per particle @xcite . in obtaining these results",
    "we have used the first two terms in the expansion of the chemical potential ( [ first_pert ] ) .",
    "the one - particle reduced density matrix ( [ rho_wave ] ) is of the classic factorized form representing the off - diagonal - long - range order ( odlro ) associated with bec @xcite .",
    "this conclusion holds for any mean particle number , as long as the mean field approximations employed are valid . here",
    "the odlro extends over separations @xmath73 , the spatial scale of the condensate . in the experiments the one - particle reduced density matrix",
    "is not measured but rather the momentum space ( velocity ) distribution is obtained by releasing the atoms from the trap , letting them fall under gravity , and imaging them .",
    "the momentum spread will then be @xmath74 , so that the odlro is transferred to a sharp spike in the imaged atomic distribution @xcite .",
    "turning now to the macroscopic wave function ( [ phi_wave ] ) , we see that the factor @xmath75 takes the form of a weighted sum of trigonometric functions with different frequencies .",
    "such sums are well known from the jaynes - cummings model of quantum optics , which describes the interaction between a single - mode radiation field and a two - level atom , and give rise to the phenomenon of collapses and revivals @xcite , and the same is expected here .",
    "collapse and revivals also appear in the relative phase between two superfluids or superconductors @xcite . directly from the form of eq .",
    "( [ foft ] ) we see that @xmath76 is periodic in time with period @xmath77 and the revivals occur with this period .",
    "the revivals result from the fact that the sum in eq .",
    "( [ foft ] ) is over the discrete particle number , so that they are a direct result of the granularity of matter .",
    "the collapses depend on the choice of the number distribution @xmath45 . for our purposes",
    "we only need the variance @xmath46 in particle number and the assumption that the phases are correlated enough that @xmath78 does not vanish exactly .",
    "then @xmath75 is periodic and has a maximum in magnitude at @xmath79 . at this time",
    "the net phases for each @xmath16 are such that they add most constructively in the sum in eq .",
    "( [ foft ] ) . as time increases these phase relations",
    "will initially be lost thus producing collapse of the magnitude of @xmath80 , until the system revives at @xmath81 .",
    "the collapse time @xmath82 may be estimated by looking at the spread of frequencies present in the wavepacket for particle numbers between @xmath83 , which yields @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "gathering our results together for the collapse and revival times we have @xmath86 the collapse phenomenon actually occurs under far more general conditions than reflected by the approximations used here , the essential ingredient being dispersion of the chemical potential @xmath87 over the particle number variance @xmath46 .",
    "landau damping of plasma oscillations in an electron plasma is another example of decay of a coherent state .",
    "in contrast , the exactly periodic revivals arise from the linear dependence of @xmath88 on @xmath89 employed in eq .",
    "( [ first_pert ] ) . if higher - order corrections are retained in the expansion ( [ first_pert ] ) the revivals are no longer perfectly periodic , and diminish with increasing time .",
    "we also note that according to eq .",
    "( [ rho_wave ] ) the single - particle reduced density matrix is insensitive to the collapse and revivals of the macroscopic wave function , which is then also the case for the atomic bec experiments @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic limit of these results must be taken with care .",
    "in particular , in order to maintain a constant density as the mean particle number is increased it is necessary to concomitantly increase the linear trap size as @xmath90 . then @xmath91 and @xmath92 , so that collapse and revivals become irrelevant for @xmath93 . in addition , we find that @xmath94 by the following argument : the approximate uncertainty relation @xmath95 holds for the number and phase fluctuations of the condensate .",
    "then , as @xmath96 we have @xmath97 , which is the case for a coherent state with phases @xmath98 .",
    "thus , in the thermodynamic limit the quantum state of the condensate approaches a coherent state for which we find @xmath99 .",
    "we then have @xmath100 , and this is precisely the limit in which the macroscopic wave function acts as an order parameter @xcite .",
    "we now consider the case that the atomic bec is interfered with a second large condensate whose macroscopic wave function we write as @xmath101 $ ] . here",
    "we have assumed that the second condensate is spatially large and write it as a plane - wave with wavevector @xmath102 , and has the same chemical potential as the first for simplicity .",
    "we further assume that the second condensate is composed of a large number of atoms so that collapses and revivals are not an issue , the constant @xmath103 is real , and @xmath104 is the arbitrary but fixed phase of the condensate . then , when the two condensates are made to interfere , say by dropping them on top of each other , the resulting interference pattern is described by the cross term @xmath105 in the thermodynamic limit where @xmath106 this interference pattern takes the form of a stationary spatial modulation of wavevector @xmath107 over the spatial extent @xmath108 of the condensate ( we assume @xmath109 so that an interference pattern is evident )",
    ". however , due to the factor @xmath76 appearing in the interference pattern it is clear that the interference will display the collapses and revivals predicted for the macroscopic wave function : when the macroscopic wave function collapses and revives so does the visibility of the interference pattern with the same period @xmath110 .",
    "thus quantum interference of two condensates provides an experimental signature of the predicted collapses and revivals .",
    "furthermore , the arguments are easily extended to the case that both condensates display collapses and revivals , that is two identical condensates , and the same conclusions apply .",
    "the collapse and revival times calculated for the current experiments are shown in columns six and seven of table i , respectively . here",
    "we see that except for the weak trap in rb ( second row ) the collapse times are all less than one second , indicating that collapse of the macroscopic wave function occurs in these traps .",
    "in contrast , the revival times are considerably longer . however , the 6 s revival time found for the strong trap in rb is still within the condensate lifetime of 15 s quoted for that experiment @xcite , though the effects of dissipation may quench the revival . in this respect , we note that the recent rb experiment ( third row ) with a higher trap frequency and mean particle number has a lower revival time of 3.75 s.",
    "[ section3 ] in this section we look at the build up of quantum coherence between two bose - einstein condensates initially in fock states .",
    "since we start from fock states no phase is initially assumed with a phase only established via the measurement process .",
    "the system we consider was first proposed by javanainen and yoo@xcite , and consists of two bose - einstein condensates which are dropped on top of one another .",
    "each of the condensates consist of @xmath35 atoms with momentum @xmath111 and @xmath112 directed along the x - axis , respectively .",
    "atoms are detected on a screen placed below the two condensates . a detection at some position @xmath113 is represented by the field operator for the sum of the two condensates @xmath114",
    "where @xmath115 , and @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the atom annihilation operators for the first and second bose - einstein condensates respectively ( see below ) .",
    "an interference pattern is generated from the two condensates because every detection of an atom introduces uncertainty into the atom number in each condensate since we do not know which condensate this atom came from .",
    "however , the total number in both condensates is always known since it is just the initial total number minus the number of detections we have observed .",
    "the uncertainty relationship between the relative atom number and phase between these condensates allows us to establish a relative phase between them to some precision .",
    "the effect of collisions on the establishment of quantum phase has been studied previously @xcite . here",
    "we extend this work to demonstrate collapses and revivals in the visibility pattern between two interfering condensates .",
    "for the purposes of developing a model based on atomic detection the full quantum field theory involving the field operators is cumbersome .",
    "thus , here we reduce the full problem by using a mode expansion and truncating .",
    "in particular , we write the heisenberg field annihilation operator as a mode expansion over single - particle states as @xmath118 where @xmath119 are a complete orthonormal basis set , and @xmath120 the corresponding eigenvalues . here in the last line we have chosen @xmath121 as one member of the complete orthonormal set , and identified @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "then by construction the first term in the mode expansion acts only on the condensate state vector , whereas the second term @xmath124 accounts for the non - condensate atoms .",

    "however , eq . ( [ foft ] ) reveals a particle number dependent phase - shift @xmath135 .",
    "the discrepancy between these two results arises since the phase - shift in the single - mode theory is an average over the spatial profile of the macroscopic wave function , as evidenced by the overlap integral in the definition of the collision rate @xmath128 in eq .",

    "the size of the coefficient of this term depends on the physical geometry of the situation ( the overlap of the two condensates ) ranging from zero to @xmath172 . setting this coefficient to zero we are taking the worst case scenario where the effects of the collisions are the strongest .",
    "alternatively , setting the cross - collison term to @xmath173 completes the square in the hamiltonian so that the subsequent evolution depends only on the total atom number .",
    "the effect of the collisions would then be to rotate the phase of the entire state vector , and the coherence between the individual entangled number states would be preserved .    in each run of the numerical simulation the state vector experiences three different regimes .",
    "initially a sequence of detections are accumulated to prepare the entangled state , after which the detections are turned off . during the coherent evolution stage free of detections , the conditional visibility undergoes collapses and revivals due to collisions .",
    "finally , the detections are turned on again . if the detections are turned on when the visibility is zero , during a collapse , it is quickly re - established by the second sequence of detections .",
    "if , however , the detections are turn on when the visibility is in a revival phase the visibility starts from this non - zero value and then quickly increases to one .",
    "this behavior is seen in fig.[fig01 ] where the detection process occurs at a much faster rate than the collapse and revivals , and we thus graph the single run on three separate set of axes : the top graph shows the initial growth of the conditional visibility due to the detections of atoms from the condensates , and the visibility quickly increases to a value close to unity after @xmath174 atoms are detected .",
    "( in these simulations the total number of atoms is @xmath175 and 200 atomic detections are made , so the assumption underlying the quantum anharmonic oscillator model that the mean number of atoms varies little is well obeyed . )",
    "the middle graph shows what happens to the visibility once the detection process is turned off and the state vector undergoes coherent evolution due to the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ coll_ham ] ) , and collapses and revivals of the visibility are clearly evident .",
    "this behavior is reminiscent of the collapses and revivals in the jaynes - cummings model of quantum optics for a two - photon process which also displays the periodic revivals of fig.[fig01 ] .",
    "the bottom graph displays the subsequent evolution of the visibility when the detection process is turned on again .",
    "due to the collapses and revivals during the coherent evolution , the initial visibility for the final stage depends on the time at which the detections are reinitiated .",
    "whatever the initial visibility , this second detection proceeds very rapidly to increase the visibility to a value close to unity .",
    "the cleanliness and exhibition of full revivals in the middle graph of fig.1 can be understood by noticing that the two condensate system is a closed system ( no loss mechanism ) undergoing coherent evolution .",
    "the state vector after the initial sequence of detections is an expansion of entangled number states .",
    "the effect of collisions during the coherent evolution is to rotate the phase of the coefficients of each entangled state by an amount proportional to the sum of the squares of the number of atoms in each condensate .",
    "thus the phase of the coefficients of this state vector rotate at differing frequencies .",
    "so far we have shown collapses and revivals in the conditional visibility of the interference pattern . for something more relevant to an experimental situation we would like to look at variables associated with the actual observed interference patterns .",
    "the phase shift of an interference pattern is a direct measure of the relative phase established between the two condensates .",
    "thus , let us consider the following procedure : firstly , we prepare a state vector of the two condensates with an established relative phase via measurements , and consider this entangled state between the two condensates after the detections to be our initial state which possesses some degree of coherence .",
    "this state is then allowed to undergo coherent evolution with no detections , and finally we turn on the measurement process after an elapsed time and collect our second sequence of measurements .",
    "the phase of the resulting interference pattern is calculated with respect to the phase of the interference pattern we observed previously from the first sequence of measurements .",
    "now we re - prepare the initial state and repeat the second sequence of measurements and subsequent calculation of phase . repeating this many times",
    "we obtain a set of relative phases between the first and second set of measurements , the idea being that if the time elapsed between the two detection regimes corresponds to some multiple of the full revival time then this set of relative phases should be sharply peaked at zero . for other elapsed times",
    "we may expect to see partial revivals .",
    "we do not need to numerically calculate the coherent evolution but what we need from the numerical simulation is the coefficients of the prepared state @xmath176 its coherent evolution due to the hamiltonian @xmath177 describing the collisions previously given by eq .",

    "the white regions denotes the peaks with the black ones corresponding to the valleys .",
    "we see a sharp peak at zero time about zero phase difference between the two interference patterns , this is not surprising since no coherent evolution has occurred . by the time we have evolved for one revival period we obtain a sharp peak at @xmath186 radians corresponding to the first revival time with @xmath166 phase shift due to detecting an even number of atoms described in the previous section .",
    "the second revival occurs at a phase difference of zero radians as predicted .",
    "away from these revival times , the phase distribution is not flat but displays many partial revivals .",
    "figure ( [ fig02]b ) is a zoomed in view of fig .",
    "( [ fig02]a ) between @xmath187 and @xmath188 revival periods , we can clearly see the partial revival at @xmath187 which consists of five peaks .",
    "in fact we see partial revivals at every integer fraction of a revival period provided the resolution is good enough .",
    "we illustrate this by labelling to the left of the graph with the appropriate integer fractions corresponding to the particular partial revival .",
    "figure ( [ fig03 ] ) shows the distribution for the other case where the number of detections is odd .",
    "as predicted there is no @xmath166 phase shifts .",
    "again , we see partial revivals when we zoom in between @xmath187 and @xmath188 revival periods as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig03]b ) .",
    "we will show in this brief section that collapses and revivals also arise for the quantum anharmonic oscillator model for initial coherent states instead of preparing an entangled state from an initial detection process . in the language of the previous section we are considering the interference between two coherent states including the effects of collisions .",

    "the period of these revivals is @xmath205 which is identical to eq .",
    "( [ revper ] ) with @xmath206 .",
    "this gives twice the period of the previous case of revivals from a detection process ( see eq .",
    "( [ period ] ) ) , even though we have used identical hamiltonians .",
    "this difference arises because we have two independent coherent states here whereas in the case of detecting atoms from two initial fock states the total atom number is always fixed at the initial total number minus the number of atomic detections .",
    "this additional constraint on the total number means that the difference atom number operator inside the exponential in eq .",
    "( [ numdiff ] ) is quantized in units of @xmath207 the above expression for the period is only applicable when we are free to superpose total atom numbers , as in the case of two coherent states for which the difference atom number operator is quantized in units of @xmath208 this gives a factor of @xmath209 difference in the revival times between assuming an initial relative phase and establishing this phase in the dynamics of the revivals .",
    "the visibility , as described by eq .",
    "( [ coll_rev ] ) , smoothly drops to its minimal value halfway between subsequent revivals , exactly where the state induced by detection would have an additional revival .",
    "in this paper we have shown that within the approximation of bose broken symmetry the macroscopic wave function in small atomic samples exhibits collapse and revivals in time while the bec is maintained in the form of odlro . for current experiments",
    "the collapse time is a second or less .",
    "the revival time is longer but our results show that it may still fall within the condensate lifetime for some experiments . to detect the collapses and revivals",
    "experimentally a scheme is required which is sensitive to the macroscopic wave function directly , and this does not seem to be the case for the coherent light scattering methods previously discussed @xcite-@xcite . however , imamoglu and kennedy @xcite and javanainen @xcite have recently proposed light scattering schemes involving two independent condensates coupled by a common excited state .",
    "these schemes rely on the fact that when one condensate is driven optically the light scattered from the other condensate has a non - zero value of the electric field and a phase proportional to the relative phase of the two condensates . by driving both wells and adjusting the phase difference of the fields",
    "the scattering can be suppressed via quantum interference , and this in turn determines the phase difference between the two condensates .",
    "the scattering is therefore sensitive to bose broken gauge symmetry .",
    "in addition , the light scattering rate is proportional to the magnitude of the macroscopic wave function , so these schemes could be used to detect the collapses and revivals experimentally . alternatively , as we have shown here , a direct measurement of the collapse and revivals in the visibilty of the interference between two condensates can be made .    in a second approach",
    "we have also studied the establishment of a relative phase between two interfering condensates using the explicit measurement model first proposed by javanainen and yoo @xcite .",
    "this model is free from any assumptions concerning bose broken symmetry or the thermodynamic limit , and is therefore applicable to small atomic samples . in this case",
    "we consider the two interfering condensates to be in number states initially , an extreme example for which there is no relative phase before atomic detections .",
    "these condensates are then prepared into an entangled state vector composed of entangled number eigenstates via the measurement process .",

    "the simple anharmonic model of interference between two condensates also displays collapses and revivals .",
