    "it has been discussed that the resonant conversion ( msw effect ) @xcite of electron neutrinos into some sterile state in the dense media of type - ii supernova could lead to some nontrivial consequences @xcite .",
    "we have reanalysed the impact of such conversion on supernova physics assuming the mass of the sterile state to be in the cosmologically significant range , i.e. 1 - 100 ev , the range relevant as dark matter component in the universe @xcite    in what follows we will consider the system of @xmath3 and @xmath2 ( and their anti - partners ) with non - zero masses and mixings and neglect the mixing between other flavors .",
    "the mass spectrum of neutrinos with the sterile state , relevant for our discussion , could naturally appear in some models @xcite .",
    "the effective potential for the @xmath4 system is given by , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the fermi constant , @xmath7 is the matter density , @xmath8 is the nucleon mass and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the net electron and neutron number per baryon , respectively . for anti - neutrino system @xmath11",
    "should be replaced by @xmath12 .",
    "the resonance condition is given as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the mass squared difference , @xmath15 is the neutrino energy and @xmath16 is the mixing angle .",
    "we assume @xmath17 , i.e. , the heavier state is mostly sterile state .    in general , in the region above the neutrinosphere the density decreases as @xmath18 ( the radial distance from the center ) increases .",
    "on the other hand , the electron fraction @xmath9 takes minimum value nearby the neutrinosphere due to the efficient neutronization process and then @xmath9 increases as @xmath18 increases .    in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) the behavior of the matter density @xmath7 and the electron fraction @xmath9 above the neutrinosphere are schematically shown . in fig . 1 ( b ) we plot the behavior of the potential which can be inferred from the behaviors of @xmath7 and @xmath9 in ( a ) .    from fig . 1 ( b ) we notice that for @xmath19 0 as neutrinos leave from the neutrinosphere to the outer region , first @xmath20 s undergo resonant conversion and then @xmath3 s are converted .",
    "the latter could undergo the transition twice if the values of @xmath21 is smaller than the maximum value of @xmath11 ( see fig .",
    "1(b ) ) . in this work",
    "we appropriately take into account the double resonances for the @xmath0 channel .    -0.7",

    "in this section we discuss the effect of @xmath0 and @xmath1 conversions on shock re - heating , @xmath20 signal and heavy elements nucleosynthesis using the @xmath7 and @xmath9 profiles from wilson s supernova model .",
    "we first consider the neutrino - conversion effect on shock re - heating in the delayed explosion scenario @xcite .",
    "we estimate the neutrino energy deposition rate at the stalled shock with and without conversion and take the ratio which is defined to be @xmath22 .",
    "it is clear that disappearance of either @xmath3 or @xmath20 due to the resonant conversion into the sterile states will reduce the rate @xmath22 . in fig .",
    "2 we plot the iso - contour for different values of the ratio @xmath22 in the parameter space ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "we can conclude that if the neutrino re - heating is essential for successful supernova explosion the parameter region right to the curve , say @xmath24 , is disfavoured .    -0.8 cm    -1.5 cm    -0.5 cm      next we consider the impact on the observation of @xmath25 signal on the earth .",
    "it is also clear that the resonant conversion of @xmath1 could induce a reduction of @xmath25 signal in the terrestrial detector . in fig .",
    "3 we present the contours of the @xmath25 survival probability , properly averaged over the neutrino energy . we conclude that the successful observation of the @xmath25 signal from supernova sn1987a in kamiokande and imb detectors @xcite implies the absence of significant conversion of @xmath1 , disfavouring the parameter region right to the curve , say @xmath26 .    -0.8",
    "cm    -1.5 cm    -0.7 cm      finally we discuss the impact of the neutrino conversion on heavy elements nucleosynthesis , so called @xmath18-process in supernova @xcite . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite one of the most relevant physical parameter in the @xmath18-process is the electron fraction @xmath9 .",
    "to have successful @xmath18-process the site must be neutron rich , i.e. @xmath27 . the @xmath9 value is mainly determined by the competition between the following two absorption reactions : @xmath28 in the standard supernova model the latter process is favoured due to the higher average energy of @xmath25 guaranteeing the neutron richness .",
    "we expect that @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) conversion induce a decrease ( increase ) of @xmath9 due to the decrease of the first ( second ) neutrino - absorption reaction in eq .",
    "( [ absorptions ] ) .",
    "the decrease of @xmath9 implies that the site becomes more neutron rich and the @xmath18-process could be enhanced @xcite whereas the increase of @xmath9 induces the suppression of the @xmath18-process .",
    "therefore , depending on which conversion channel is more efficient the @xmath18-process could either be enhanced or suppressed . in fig .",
    "4 we present the effect of neutrino conversion on the value of @xmath9 . in the region",
    "right to the curve @xmath29 the value of @xmath9 is larger than 0.5 and hence the @xmath18-process is suppressed .",
    "on the other hand , in the region delimited by the curve @xmath30 the value of @xmath9 could be decreased compared to the standard case , leading to the enhancement of @xmath18-process .",
    "we note that due to non - trivial `` feedback '' effect the value of @xmath9 is not expected to be smaller than 1/3 .",
