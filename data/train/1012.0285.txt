    "gauge singlet fields are a simple but very interesting form of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "a gauge singlet scalar(@xmath2 ) can be a thermal dark matter candidate by having @xmath2 couple to the higgs boson ( for example , see @xcite ) . in order to have it be stable or long - lived ,",
    "a symmetry might be imposed or any decay channel has to be suppressed by a high energy scale , usually comparable to the planck scale .    on the other hand , gauge - singlet fermions , known as right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos , can explain the observed tiny neutrino masses @xcite via the type - i seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "rh neutrinos can also accommodate the observed baryon asymmetry @xcite via thermal leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of leptogenesis satisfies the three sakharov s conditions @xcite ( i ) baryon number violation , ( ii ) @xmath3 and @xmath4 violation , ( iii ) deviation from thermal equilibrium . a lepton number asymmetry is generated via the decay of heavy rh majorana neutrinos , which is converted into the baryon number asymmetry through spharelon processes @xcite . in order to be the main source of the baryon asymmetry , the mass scale of the heavy rh neutrinos must typically be larger than @xmath5 gev @xcite , which requires a high reheating temperature .",
    "such a high reheating temperature leads to gravitino overproduction @xcite in the context of supersymmetry .",
    "there are many ways to avoid gravitino overproduction .",
    "resonant leptogenesis @xcite , for instance , assumes the limit @xmath6 so that @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be as low as of order tev .",
    "there is enhancement to the lepton asymmetry by taking into account flavor effects @xcite . in @xcite , @xcite , and",
    "references therein , there are more detailed discussions on the solutions to the gravitino overproduction problem",
    ".    it is intriguing to combine these different ideas together , i.e. , to have the gauge singlet scalar and fermions at once in the theory .",
    "this is done , e.g. , in @xcite , which aims at lifting the tension between x - ray bounds and the lyman-@xmath9 bounds in the dodelson - widrow ( dw ) model @xcite , where the dark matter is the rh neutrino that is generated from neutrino oscillations .",
    "the constraint from x - rays puts an upper bound on the mass of the rh neutrino since it can decay into an active neutrino and a photon via loop diagrams and the decay rate is proportional to the mass of the rh neutrino . at the same time , lyman-@xmath9 puts a lower bound on the thermal - averaged momentum of the rh neutrino which equivalently is a lower bound on its mass . for more details , see @xcite . in the context of the dw model , the two constraints can not be satisfied at once . to reduce the tension between the two bounds , @xcite has both gauge - singlet scalar @xmath2 and gauge - singlet fermions @xmath10 , where @xmath2 couples to @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath2 decaying into @xmath10 provides an extra production mechanism of @xmath10 in addition to neutrino oscillations .",
    "s from the decay of @xmath2 get red - shifted when the universe cools down ; therefore , they have a lower thermal average momentum than those generated by oscillations .",
    "hence the lyman-@xmath9 bounds become weaker . in @xcite ,",
    "a similar setup is employed . with the help of an unbroken abelian family symmetry , @xmath11 ,",
    "under which the full lagrangian is invariant , all particles carry the charge of @xmath12 .",
    "the gauge singlet scalar , @xmath2 , couples to gauge singlet fermions , @xmath10 s , with a nontrivial structure and , at the same time , the vacuum expectation value of @xmath2 provides masses to @xmath10 s , in addition to the majorana mass terms , in such a way that the maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) matrix ( or the pontecorvo- maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns , or mnsp ) matrix ) yields @xmath13 and some regions of the parameter space with the weak washout effect , which can yield thermal leptogenesis .    in this paper , we manage to add more structure into theory , i.e. , an extra discrete symmetry , so that the framework can provide dark matter candidates , alleviate the gravitino problem of leptogenesis and make a connection between the baryon asymmetry and dark matter .",
    "to be more specific , we introduce a gauge - singlet scalar @xmath2 and several gauge - singlet fermions @xmath10 and impose a @xmath0 symmetry on @xmath2 and one of @xmath14 .",
    "in this situation , the lighter particle of @xmath2 and @xmath10 charged under the @xmath0 symmetry can be the dark matter and the @xmath0 symmetry guarantees the stability of the dark matter candidate . for leptogenesis , loop - diagrams with gauge singlets running inside give rise to the required strong and weak @xmath4 phases for the generation of the lepton asymmetry .",
    "we found that the contributions to the lepton asymmetry from the new interactions can be a dominant source of matter - antimatter asymmetry without the problem of gravitino overproduction .",
    "@xcite uses a similar concept with the type - ii seesaw mechanism .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : formalism ] , we describe the formalism and the particle content . in sec.[sec : leptogenesis ] , a detailed analysis of leptogenesis from new interactions has been displayed .",
    "the discussion on dark matter is in sec.[sec : dark matter candidate ] and we conclude in sec . [",
    "sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the full lagrangian can be written in the following way ,    @xmath15    where @xmath16 @xmath17 refers to the sm lagrangian and @xmath2 is a real singlet , whose vacuum expectation value ( vev ) is zero , and its mass @xmath18 .",
    "we introduce rh majorana neutrinos , @xmath19 , which generate tiny masses for active neutrinos , and @xmath10 , which provides a new mechanism for leptogenesis . here",
    ", we are interested in the situation with @xmath20 active , @xmath20 rh neutrinos , @xmath19 , and one extra gauge - singlet majorana fermion , @xmath10 .",
    "the lagrangian preserves a discrete symmetry under which @xmath21 and @xmath22 and the other particles remain unchanged .",
    "therefore , there are no cubic terms for @xmath2 and no @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath10 is not responsible for the see - saw mechanism .",

    "we know the relic density of the dark matter is determined by the annihilation rate into sm particles in thermal equilibrium at the time of decoupling .",
    "a rule of thumb is that it decouples when the interaction rates with sm particles are smaller than the expansion rate of the universe . to be more quantitatively precise ,",

    "it is small compared to other annihilation channels because , again , we are interested in the situation of @xmath152 tev .    in summary , for @xmath2 being the dark matter , @xmath126 is mostly determined by @xmath159 , which is a free parameter from the point of view of leptogenesis while for @xmath10 , @xmath126 is determined by @xmath71 for @xmath19 running in the loop . on the other hand , with the help of the large @xmath101 ( @xmath97 propagating inside the loop )",

    "in this situation , we have to push both @xmath71 and @xmath159 toward the strongly - coupled region .     and @xmath159 , which gives the right thermal relic abundance for @xmath73 and has successful low - scale leptogenesis , where @xmath160 in units of gev , scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "in this papaer , we propose a simple and economical model , which can accommodate both leptogenesis and the dark matter , by introducing the new scalar @xmath2 , which couples to the higgs boson and rh majorana neutrinos ( @xmath19 ) , and @xmath10 .",
    "we impose a @xmath0 symmetry under which @xmath2 and @xmath10 are odd and the rest is even ; therefore , the lighter of @xmath2 and @xmath10 could be the dark matter . by increasing the coupling , @xmath101 , and having @xmath97 much heavier than @xmath73",
    ", we can easily increase the efficiency of generation of the lepton asymmetry without having a high reheating temperature and @xmath73 can be as low as @xmath1(tev ) .",
    "note that all of the estimates of the lepton asymmetry are based on the one - flavor approximation instead of three flavors ( @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 ) .",
    "taking into account flavor effects , the efficiency factor , @xmath77 , will be modified . from @xcite , @xmath77 is enhanced by one or two orders of magnitude or remains the same order of magnitude compared to that of one - flavor approximation , which implies the estimate done before remains valid .",
    "finally , there have been studies of constraints on @xmath2 as the thermal relic via the decay of the higgs boson into @xmath2 , if kinematics allows , or the elastic scattering between @xmath2 and nuclei , see for example , @xcite .    as for @xmath10 as the dark matter , it can be produced in pairs via the higgs boson and @xmath2 .",
    "if the produced @xmath2 is on - shell , the decay width of @xmath2 into @xmath10 and a light neutrino is of order @xmath164 gev , which roughly corresponds to the decay time @xmath165 sec , which implies it can happen inside a detector .",
    "however , it is very challenging to identify that a new state ( other than @xmath2 ) has been produced since both the @xmath10 and the light neutrino would escape the detector .    at the time of writing",
    ", we notice that , in @xcite , they have demonstrated how one may obtain leptogenesis and neutrino mass generation in the see - saw picture without invoking a new mass scale far beyond that of electroweak symmetry breaking by introducing more than one higgs doublet family .",
