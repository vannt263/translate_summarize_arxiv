    "the continuum emission from hmxb accretion powered pulsars can be interpreted as comptonization of soft x - rays in the plasma above the neutron star surface .",
    "it can be modelled as a power - law with an exponential cutoff or as a broken power - law @xcite .    in the presence of strong magnetic fields ,",
    "the continuum photons produced inside the hot region by thermal bremsstrahlung and comptonization may get resonantly scattered in the line forming regions , producing a cyclotron resonant scattering feature ( crsf ) .",
    "often a strong narrow fe @xmath29 line can also be found originating from the cold dense matter in the vicinity of the neutron star .",
    "we performed pulse phase averaged spectral analysis of 1a  1118 - 61 using spectra from the front illuminated ccds ( xiss-0 and 3 ) , back illuminated ccd ( xis-1 ) , and the pin .",
    "spectral fitting was performed using _ xspec _ v12.6.0 .",
    "the energy ranges chosen for the fits were 0.810 for the xiss , and 1070 for the pin spectra .",
    "we neglected the 1.752.23 energy range in order to take out the artificial structures in the xis spectra at around the si edge and au edge .",
    "after appropriate background subtraction we fitted the spectra simultaneously with all the parameters tied , except the relative instrument normalizations which were kept free .",
    "the xis spectra were rebinned by a factor of 5 from 0.86 and 710 .",
    "however due to the presence of a narrow iron line , the spectrum was rebinned only by a factor of 2 in the 67 energy range .",
    "the pin spectra were rebinned by a factor of 3 in the 1070 range .",
    "we had initially tried to fit the continuum with a partial covering high - energy cutoff model ( similar modeling for this source has been done in @xcite ) which gave a very low value of high - energy cutoff ( @xmath003 ) for some of the phase bins while performing pulse phase resolved spectroscopy described later in section 4.2 .",
    "high energy cutoff in this scenario is equivalent to the cutoff power - law model .",
    "hence we fitted the broad band energy spectrum of 1a  1118 - 61 with a partial covering cutoff power - law model with an interstellar absorption and a gaussian line for an fe @xmath29 feature at 6.4 .",

    "its origin from the inner accretion disk is very unlikely since the size of the emission region is very small compared to the inner disc radius which is of a few hundred kms .",
    "also , the soft excess produced by the reprocessed disc blackbody component is usually seen over a broad phase range in other pulsars @xcite and not confined to a narrow phase range like in this source . .",
    "the results related to the qpo feature found at @xmath64 hz is almost similar to the one found by @xcite including its energy dependence .",
    "if the broad feature at @xmath25 hz detected in obs-2 is interpreted as being a qpo , assuming the generation of the qpo at the inner radius of the accretion disc , the decrease in the qpo frequency is consistent with the decrease in one order of magnitude of x - ray luminosity from obs-1 to obs-2 ( @xmath65 ) . using this argument",
    ", the inferred value of the magnetic field is also in agreement with the one found by the crsf @xcite .",
    "the quality factor of the qpo feature in obs-2 is however very low compared to the values found for the other accretion powered pulsars .",
    "the strong and complex energy dependence of the pulse profiles bring out the requirement of a multicomponent model to fit the energy spectra of 1a  1118 - 61 .",
    "some of the continuum models that have been used extensively to describe the spectra successfully are the negative & positive powerlaws with a common exponential ( npex ) continuum model @xcite and power - law with smooth fermi - dirac cutoff energy @xcite .",
    "the partial covering absorption model @xcite which consists of two power - law continua with a common photon index but different absorption components also describes the spectrum of these sources well .",
    "we had initially tried to fit the data with a partial covering model with a high - energy cutoff , but the spectra in some phases had a very low value of cutoff energy ( @xmath0 03 ) which is equivalent to a cutoff power - law model .",
    "the phase averaged data was thus well fitted with a partial covering cutoff power law model .",
    "the spectrum was softer and steeper at the declining phase of the outburst similar to what was found in some other hmxb transients like v  0332 + 53 @xcite and a  0535 + 26 @xcite .",
    "a narrow iron @xmath66 line centered around 6.4 kev was detected in both observations which implied the presence of neutral or weakly ionized iron .",
    "the possible origin of the iron line is the accretion disk or the circumstellar material , or the cool dense matter in the magnetosphere which reprocesses the emission .",
    "the presence of the crsf feature in the spectra had been reported previously by @xcite , @xcite , @xmath11 @xcite . from the spectral fitting with lorentzian profiles",
    ", we found that the crsf line centers at @xmath30 and @xmath31 for obs-1 and obs-2 respectively .",
    "the best fitting centriods for obs-1 and obs-2 are consistent within confidence limits .",
    "the result is also consistent with a slight increase in the centroid energy with decreasing luminosity which is in agreement with the variation of the cyclotron line energy with that of the height of the accretion column .",
    "higher the luminosity , lower in energy is the crsf produced .",
    "this is because , higher luminosity implies higher accretion rate and a higher height for the accretion column .",
    "the crsf feature is thus produced further away from the surface of the neutron star @xcite .",
    "the crsf feature is also broader in obs-1 which may be due to the superposition of crsf features produced in scattering regions at different heights of the accretion column which is higher in this case than in obs-2 .",
    "in addition to pulse phase averaged spectroscopy , we have performed pulse phase - resolved spectroscopy to understand the complex energy dependence of the pulse profiles .",
    "the column density of the material local to the neutron star ( @xmath42 ) of @xmath67 can explain the dips seen in the pulse profiles .",
    "the changes in the value of @xmath42 and the covering fraction with pulse phase give us an idea about the properties of the plasma in the accretion stream .",
    "the plasma may be a clumpy structure with different values of opacity and optical depth .",
    "we find that the accretion column in obs-1 represents a more clumpy structure with the dip at phase @xmath00.1 having a very high value of @xmath42 ( @xmath68 ) but a low covering value ( @xmath0 0.4 ) .",
    "however , both values remain high in the main dip .",
    "further , the accretion column in obs-2 , shows a more symmetric distribution of matter with a more or less constant value of covering fraction throughout the pulse phase .",
    "the spectral hardening at the peaks of the pulse profile in obs-1 may represent the passage of the magnetic axis through our line of sight , and a deep and a more direct view into the emission region along the magnetic axis @xcite .",
    "similar regions of pulse hardening have been observed previously in other sources like her  x-1 @xcite , 4u  0115 + 63 @xcite , & gx 1 + 4 @xcite . +",
    "another feature that has been found is the variation of the crsf parameters with pulse phase .",
    "since the cross section and the depth of the cyclotron scattering feature is thought to depend significantly on the viewing angle of the accretion column , the crsf properties may change with the rotation of the neutron star , hence with pulse phase .",
    "a large variation of @xmath0 10 in the cyclotron energy and a factor of 3 variation in the depth could either imply the dipole geometry being viewed at different angles at different pulse phases , or a more complex underlying magnetic field structure .",
    "fitting of this observed variation of the cyclotron parameters with phase with a detailed and suitable theoretical model can be used to infer the structure of the magnetic field around the neutron star and also put constraints on its other parameters like the inclination between the magnetic and rotation axis this is however beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we thank the reviewer for a very extensive review with many specific suggestions that helped us to improve the paper .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center on line service , provided by nasa / goddard space flight center .",
