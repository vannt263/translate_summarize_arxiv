    "the concept of jet schemes and arc space over an algebraic variety or an analytic space was introduced by nash in his preprint in 1968 which was later published as @xcite .",
    "these schemes are considered as something to represent the nature of the singularities of the base space .",
    "in fact , papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite by musta , ein and yasuda show that geometric properties of the jet schemes determine certain properties of the singularities of the base space .",
    "primarily the nash problem posed in @xcite is based on this idea .",
    "the nash problem asks if the set of arc families through the singularities corresponds bijectively to the set of the essential components of resolutions of the singularities . here",
    "an arc family through the singularities on @xmath0 is a good component of @xmath1 ( see [ good ] or @xcite for the definition of a good component ) , where @xmath2 is the canonical projection from the arc space to @xmath0 .",
    "the paper @xcite proves that if @xmath0 is a toric variety , the answer to the nash problem is `` yes '' , while the paper also shows the negative answer for general @xmath0 . in this paper , we study the structure of the arc space of a toric variety defined over an algebraically closed field @xmath3 of arbitrary characteristic .",
    "we prove that each jet scheme or arc space admits a canonical action of the jet scheme or arc space of the torus .",
    "the arc space of a toric variety becomes an almost homogeneous space by this action , which means that the arc space is the closure of one orbit .",
    "a good component turns out to be the closure of a certain orbit and there is no non - good component in the arc space of a toric variety .",
    "each orbit of the arc space corresponds to a lattice point of the cone , therefore to a toric valuation , and the dominant relation of two orbits is translated to the order relation of the corresponding lattice points . as a corollary",
    "we show the answer to the embedded version of nash problem posed by ein , lazarsfeld and musta in @xcite for an invariant ideal on a toric variety .    this paper is organized as follows : in  2 we study some basic properties on jet schemes and arc spaces .",
    "the closed points in the arc spaces of varieties are discussed here . in ",
    "3 we introduce a stratification on the arc space of a toric variety according to the fan .",
    "some basic properties of the arc space of a toric variety ( non - existence of non - good components , irreducibility in any characteristic ) are proved here . in ",
    "4 we study the orbits of the arc space of a toric variety by the action of the arc space of the torus . in  5 we give the answer to the embedded version of nash problem for an invariant ideal on a toric variety .    throughout this paper",
