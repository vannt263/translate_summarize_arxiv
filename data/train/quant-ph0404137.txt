    "an important technical requirement for developing coherent quantum technologies is the ability to assess how well one can prepare or create a particular quantum state .",
    "this assessment is carried out by making suitable measurements on a sequence of identically prepared quantum systems .",
    "the measurements are chosen so that the probabilities of the measurement outcomes suffice to determine the state ; the probabilities are estimated from the outcome frequencies observed in the measurements .",
    "a set of measurements whose outcome probabilities are sufficient to determine an arbitrary quantum state is called _ informationally complete _ @xcite .",
    "the process of determining the quantum state from the results of a sequence of these measurements is called _ quantum state tomography_.    given a set of measurements that are informationally complete , they can be amalgamated into a single generalized measurement , consisting of a coin flip to select a measurement from the set , followed by an application of that measurement .",
    "the statistics of such a generalized measurement are described by a _ positive - operator - valued measure _ ( povm ) @xcite , which consists of positive operators @xmath4 that are labeled by an index @xmath5 that runs over the possible outcomes .",
    "these operators satisfy a _ completeness condition _",
    ", @xmath6 the operators @xmath4 , satisfying @xmath7 , are called _ povm elements . _",
    "the probability for outcome  @xmath5 , given system state @xmath8 , is @xmath9 the completeness condition and the unit - trace normalization of @xmath8 guarantee that the probabilities are normalized to unity .",
    "an informationally complete set of measurements can thus always be reformulated as a single _ informationally complete povm _",
    "( ic - povm ) , i.e. , a povm having the property that the relations giving @xmath10 in terms of @xmath8 can be inverted to give @xmath8 in terms of the outcome probabilities . a normalized density operator @xmath8 is specified by @xmath11 real numbers , since an arbitrary hermitian operator on a @xmath0-dimensional quantum system is specified by @xmath12 independent real numbers , and this number is reduced by one for a normalized density operator because it has unit trace .",
    "since the relations  ( [ eq : pc ] ) are linear , it is a simple matter of linear algebra to conclude that an ic - povm must provide @xmath11 independent relations .",
    "this might lead one to think that an ic - povm can get by with @xmath11 elements , but the normalization of the outcome probabilities means that one of the relations  ( [ eq : pc ] ) is redundant , so an ic - povm must have at least @xmath12 elements .",
    "an equivalent , often more useful way of thinking is to disregard the normalization of the density operator .",
    "then , like any hermitian operator , @xmath8 is specified by @xmath12 real numbers , the additional number being @xmath13 . by virtue of the completeness condition ,",
    "any povm provides @xmath13 as the sum of the ( unnormalized ) probabilities  ( [ eq : pc ] ) .",
    "this way of thinking bypasses the waffling about normalization conditions and goes directly to the point : an ic - povm must provide @xmath12 linearly independent relations and thus must have at least @xmath12 povm elements .    informational completeness for arbitrary quantum states",
    "is thus equivalent to the ability to reconstruct _ any _ hermitian operator @xmath14 from the operator inner products @xmath15 .",
    "this means that the problem of finding informationally complete povms is reduced to finding positive operators @xmath16 that span the vector space of hermitian operators . if these operators do nt satisfy the completeness condition  ( [ eq : completeness ] ) , one replaces them with the operators @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is trivially a nonsingular operator .",
    "the new operators are positive , satisfy the completeness condition , and are obviously informationally complete . using this procedure ,",
    "it is easy to construct _ minimal _ ic - povms , i.e. , povms having @xmath12 elements , from sets of @xmath12 linearly independent , positive operators .",
    "indeed , it is easy to construct minimal ic - povms for which all the povm elements are rank - one , i.e. , multiples of projectors onto pure states @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is evidence , both analytical and numerical , that in all finite dimensions there are minimal , rank - one ic - povms , called _ symmetric , informationally complete povms _",
    "( sic - povms ) , for which the operator inner products of all pairs of povm elements are the same @xcite .",
    "recast as ensembles of states , sic - povms have applications to quantum key distribution @xcite , and they have been shown @xcite to be the ensembles that are most quantum according to a measure of quantumness introduced by fuchs and sasaki @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the pure - state version of informational completeness , i.e. , reconstruction of an arbitrary pure state @xmath19 from the outcome probabilities @xmath20 we formalize the notion of pure - state information completeness in the following definition .    *",
    "definition ( psi - completeness ) .",
    "* a _ pure - state informationally complete _ ( _ psi - complete _ ) povm on a finite - dimensional quantum system is a povm whose outcome probabilities are sufficient to determine any pure state ( up to a global phase ) , except for a set of pure states that is dense only on a set of measure zero .    the intent of the last clause is to require the inversion to be unique for generic pure states .",
    "this clause says that any pure state outside a set of measure zero is surrounded by an open ball of states all of which are uniquely determined by the outcome probabilities .",
    "though some of the thinking and some of the mathematical techniques developed for ic - povms can be transferred to a study of psi - complete povms , there is a critical difference , which makes psi - completeness more difficult to analyze : the relation between the outcome probabilities and a density operator is linear , whereas the relation between outcome probabilities and pure states is quadratic .",
    "the problem of ic - povms thus lies squarely within linear algebra , whereas psi - completeness must be tackled using other tools .",
    "the first point to make about psi - completeness arises from a simple counting argument .",
    "a pure state is specified by @xmath0 complex amplitudes , corresponding to @xmath2 real numbers , but the number of independent real numbers is reduced to @xmath21 by the normalization condition , @xmath22 , and by the fact that a pure state can be multiplied by a global phase without changing any of its predictions for probabilities . because of the redundancy due to the normalization of the povm probabilities , a psi - complete povm must contain at least one more element than the @xmath21 real numbers to be determined .",
    "this suggests that a psi - complete povm might get by with only @xmath1 elements .",
    "this argument can be profitably rephrased in terms of unnormalized pure states , which are specified by @xmath1 real numbers , giving immediately that a psi - complete povm must have at least @xmath1 elements . unlike the similar counting argument for density operators , however ,",
    "the counting argument for psi - complete povms is only suggestive , because linear algebra ca nt be applied to give rigorous conclusions .",
    "the counting argument leaves us only with a prejudice that the minimal number of elements in a psi - complete povm ought to be @xmath1 or a little more .",
    "the point of this paper is to provide some rigor .",
    "we establish that @xmath2 , not @xmath1 , is the minimal number of elements in a psi - complete povm .  to show this",
    ", we first prove that a povm with fewer than @xmath2 elements  in particular , one with @xmath1 elements  cannot be psi - complete ( sec .",
    "[ sec : necessity ] ) , and we then construct an example of a psi - complete povm with @xmath2 elements ( sec .",
    "[ sec : sufficiency ] ) .",
    "asher peres considered a particular version of this problem in his classic 1993 quantum - mechanics textbook @xcite .",
    "he noted that the probabilities in two _ complementary bases _ should be sufficient to determine a pure state up to a finite set of ambiguities . if we let @xmath23 , denote an orthonormal basis , the complementary basis consists of the vectors @xmath24 these complementary bases are discrete analogues of the position and momentum bases of a particle moving in one spatial dimension .",
    "a consequence of our work is that measurements in two complementary bases can not be psi - complete . to see this , notice that the amalgamated povm for the two measurements has @xmath2 povm elements , @xmath25 the factor of @xmath26 takes care of the coin flip that chooses with equal probability between measurements in the two bases .",
    "the probabilities associated with the last povm element in each basis , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , provide no information because of the separate normalization of the measurements in the two bases . without losing any information",
    ", we can combine these two povm elements into a single element , @xmath29 , thus reducing the number of povm elements to @xmath1 .",
    "our proof in sec .",
    "[ sec : necessity ] shows this can not be psi - complete ; attempts to find a pure state from the outcome probabilities must at least suffer from the finite ambiguities mentioned by peres .",
    "following peres , we illustrate these ambiguities in two dimensions in sec .  [",
    "sec : twod ] .    the problem considered by peres",
    "is often called the _ pauli problem _ , as it is the finite - dimensional version of a question posed by pauli in a footnote to his quantum - mechanics article in _ handbuch der physik _",
    "@xcite : can the wave function @xmath30 of a particle be determined ( up to a global phase ) from the position and momentum probability distributions , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ?",
    "the answer to pauli s question is a definitive _ no _ : there are many wave functions not determined by their position and momentum distributions and thus said to be _",
    "pauli nonunique_. much work has been devoted to investigating pauli nonunique states ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references cited therein ) , but even now there does not seem to be a complete characterization of such wave functions .",
    "a simple example of a pauli nonunique state is an eigenstate of parity , @xmath33 ( and @xmath34 ) , that is not time - reversal invariant , i.e. , @xmath35 ; such a wave function satisfies @xmath36 , so @xmath30 and @xmath37 , though distinct states , have the same position and momentum distributions .",
    "discussion of work on pauli nonunique states lies outside the scope of our paper , but we do note the interesting result of corbett and hurst @xcite that pauli nonunique wave functions are dense in the space of wave functions , a result that motivates the denseness restriction in our definition of psi - completeness .",
    "previous work on psi - completeness for finite - dimensional quantum systems @xcite has considered the system to be a spin-@xmath38 particle ( @xmath39 ) and has focused mainly on reconstructing a pure state from the probabilities for spin components along several directions .",
    "the angular - momentum algebra and the rotation group play essential roles in these considerations .",
    "we review some of these results during the course of our discussion and point out how they are related to our work and , in particular , how they can be rephrased in terms of a single povm .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : twod ] , we introduce informationally complete and psi - complete povms in two dimensions and note that the two - dimensional case provides little guidance for generalizing psi - completeness to higher dimensions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : necessity ] , we prove that the outcome probabilites of a povm with @xmath1 elements are insufficient to determine a general pure state in @xmath0 dimensions , leading to , at best , a two - state ambiguity . in sec .  [",
    "sec : sufficiency ] , we construct a psi - complete povm with @xmath2 elements , and in sec .  [",
    "sec : pure ] , we turn to the question of rank - one psi - complete povms and construct one with @xmath3 povm elements . section  [ sec : conclusion ] gives a brief summary of open questions , while sec .",
    "[ s : epilogue ] closes with a poetic description of one of these questions , dedicated to asher peres on the occasion of his 70th birthday ; alternatively , the reader might prefer to skip directly to sec .  [",
    "s : epilogue ] and omit the rest of the article . ] .",
    "we can gain some insight into ic - povms and psi - complete povms by looking at the case of a two - dimensional quantum system ( qubit ) , where the bloch representation of states and operators permits us give a complete characterization of information completeness .",
    "the bloch representation of an arbitrary povm element for a qubit is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a unit vector in @xmath42 and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are nonnegative real numbers satisfying @xmath45 and @xmath46 , to ensure that @xmath47 and @xmath48 are positive operators .",
    "rank - one povm elements have @xmath49 .",
    "a povm is made up of @xmath50 such elements , @xmath51 satisfying the completeness condition  ( [ eq : completeness ] ) , which now becomes two conditions , @xmath52    a povm is informationally complete if and only if the povm elements @xmath4 span the four - dimensional space of hermitian operators .",
    "translated to the bloch representation , this says that a povm is informationally complete if and only if the vectors @xmath53 span @xmath42 .",
    "a direct way to see this in the bloch representation is to note that for an arbitrary density operator @xmath54 , with polarization vector @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , the outcome probabilities are given by @xmath57 to reconstruct an arbitrary polarization vector , the vectors @xmath53 must span @xmath42 .    the minimal number of elements in an ic - povm is four ; one sees this directly in the bloch representation by noting that the vectors @xmath53 must span @xmath42 and also satisfy the condition  ( [ eq : betan ] ) , implying that there must be at least four vectors . for a minimal ic - povm",
    ", it is also easy to see from condition  ( [ eq : betan ] ) that any three of the four vectors @xmath53 must be linearly independent and thus span @xmath42 ( and this means that none of the @xmath58 can be zero ) .",
    "an example of a minimal , rank - one ic - povm , which we make use of in sec .",
    "[ sec : pure ] , is given by the _ tetrahedral measurement _ , which is specified by the four unit vectors @xmath59 with @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "this povm is also a sic - povm by virtue of the symmetric placement of the bloch vectors , which connect the origin to the vertices of a tetrahedron whose apex is at the north pole of the bloch sphere .",
    "a psi - complete measurement is one such that the outcome probabilities  ( [ eq:2dprobs ] ) determine uniquely a generic pure state @xmath62 .",
    "it is immediately clear that to reconstruct an arbitrary unit vector @xmath63 , the vectors @xmath53 must span @xmath42 , so a psi - complete measurement in two dimensions is always informationally complete for all states , pure or mixed .",
    "for this reason psi - completeness for qubits provides little guidance for what happens in higher dimensions : in two dimensions , the @xmath2 povm elements required for psi - completeness provide the @xmath12 elements necessary for informational completeness for all states , whereas in higher dimensions , there is a yawning gap between @xmath2 and @xmath12 .",
    "it is worth stressing the way a three - element povm fails to be psi - complete .",
    "the condition  ( [ eq : betan ] ) implies that the three vectors @xmath53 are linearly dependent and thus span at most a plane .",
    "the outcome probabilities  ( [ eq:2dprobs ] ) provide no information about the component of @xmath63 orthogonal to the plane .",
    "when the vectors @xmath53 do span a plane , the outcome probabilities determine the projection of @xmath63 onto this plane , which specifies everything about @xmath63 except the sign of the component orthogonal to the plane .",
    "this two - fold ambiguity is the source of the povm s incompleteness for pure states .",
    "a symmetric example of a three - outcome , rank - one measurement is the _ trine measurement _ on a qubit @xcite , given by the unit vectors @xmath64 with @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "these vectors point from the origin to the vertices of an equilateral triangle lying in the equatorial plane of the bloch sphere .",
    "the outcome probabilities for the trine determine the equatorial component of the bloch vector for a pure state , but ca nt resolve whether the bloch vector is in the northern hemisphere or the southern hemisphere , thus leaving a two - state ambiguity .",
    "in this section we show that the outcome probabilities of a povm with @xmath1 outcomes are insufficient to determine a generic pure state .",
    "in particular , we prove the following theorem .    * theorem . * the outcome probabilities @xmath67 of a povm with @xmath1 measurement outcomes are insufficient to determine a generic pure state @xmath68 in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "we prove the theorem by showing that any allowed distribution of outcome probabilities , except a set of distributions of measure zero , is consistent with at least two possible pure states .",
    "the proof occupies the remainder of this section .",
    "we begin by picking a particular povm element , say @xmath69 , and writing it in its orthonormal eigenbasis @xmath70 : @xmath71 we order the eigenvalues from smallest to largest , i.e. , @xmath72 .",
    "we can assume that @xmath73 , because otherwise @xmath69 would be a multiple of the identity operator and would provide no useful information beyond that always contained in the normalization constraint .",
    "any pure state can be expanded in this eigenbasis as @xmath74 we use the global phase freedom to make @xmath75 real , but we do not require @xmath76 to be normalized . instead we consider the norm to be an extra parameter of the state , which is determined by the sum of the ( unnormalized ) outcome probabilities  ( [ eq : pcpsi ] ) , @xmath77 by virtue of the completeness condition  ( [ eq : completeness ] ) for our povm .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath78 are arbitrary complex numbers , which we now write in terms of their real and imaginary parts , i.e. , @xmath79 .",
    "the variables necessary to define the state are now the @xmath1 real co - ordinates @xmath75 , @xmath80 , each of which is free to take on any real value .",
    "we find it convenient to put all these co - ordinates into a single real vector @xmath81 , whose components are @xmath82 notice that an inversion through the origin , i.e. , @xmath83 , produces a global sign change in @xmath68 .",
    "when @xmath84 , we could remove the global phase freedom entirely by making @xmath85 positive , but we choose to retain this two - fold ambiguity so that the space we are dealing with is the entirety of @xmath86 .",
    "each of the @xmath1 outcome probabilities can now be written as a quadratic form @xmath87 where the quantities @xmath88 are the matrix elements of a real , symmetric , positive ( semi - definite ) matrix @xmath89 .",
    "a surface of constant @xmath90 is a @xmath91-dimensional ( possibly degenerate ) hyperellipsoid @xmath92 , which extends to @xmath93 in a number of dimensions given by @xmath94 and has a hyperellipsoidal cross - section in the remaining dimensions , numbering @xmath95 .",
    "notice that by construction the first outcome probability has a diagonal matrix @xmath96 , @xmath97 and is thus a hyperellipsoid aligned with the co - ordinate axes .",
    "we now replace two of the outcome probabilities by equivalent constraints .",
    "first we replace the last outcome probability ( @xmath98 ) by the normalization condition  ( [ eq : r ] ) , @xmath99 something we can do because @xmath100 .",
    "a surface of constant norm @xmath101 is , of course , a sphere @xmath102 of radius @xmath103 in @xmath86 .",
    "each physical state @xmath68 with @xmath104 is represented twice on this sphere of radius @xmath103 , once in the northern hemisphere ( @xmath105 ) and again , with its sign reversed , at the antipode in the southern hemisphere ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "states on the equator ( @xmath107 ) retain the full global phase freedom .",
    "the second modification is to replace the first outcome probability  ( [ eq : p1 ] ) with an equivalent constraint in which @xmath85 does not appear : @xmath108 that @xmath109 follows because @xmath110 is the smallest eigenvalue .",
    "moreover , we are guaranteed that @xmath111 is not always zero because @xmath73 .",
    "all this means that a surface of constant @xmath112 is a hyperellipsoid @xmath113 , aligned with the @xmath114 axes , which runs off to @xmath93 along the @xmath85 axis ( and perhaps other axes ) and which has an ellipsoidal boundary in one or more co - ordinates @xmath114 .",
    "now consider a particular set of values for @xmath101 , @xmath115 , and @xmath111 , and imagine applying the constraints imposed by these @xmath1 measured values in the order listed .",
    "the first step in the process yields the submanifold @xmath116 . the set @xmath117 obtained",
    "after @xmath118 steps is the intersection of @xmath119 with the hyperellipsoidal submanifold @xmath120 , @xmath121 the last step intersects @xmath122 with @xmath113 to yield the set @xmath123 .",
    "we note that for all @xmath118 , @xmath117 is a compact set because the process starts with the sphere @xmath124 , which is itself compact . for psi - completeness",
    "the final set @xmath125 must consist generically of just the two antipodal points representing a particular pure state .",

    "this is because at all points of intersection , the tangent vectors of the two submanifolds span @xmath126 . ]",
    "having set up the entire problem , we now need a bit of differential geometry about the intersection of submanifolds .",
    "given a manifold @xmath103 of dimension @xmath127 , two submanifolds , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , of dimensions @xmath130 and @xmath131 , intersect _ transversally _ if at each point of intersection @xmath132 , the vectors in the tangent spaces to @xmath128 and @xmath129 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 , span the entire tangent space to @xmath103 at @xmath132 ( see fig .

    "a transversal intersection @xmath135 is a submanifold of dimension @xmath136 , since this relation holds for the dimensions of the tangent spaces at each point of intersection . a fundamental theorem of differential geometry , called _ sard s theorem _ @xcite",

    "we now apply these ideas to our situation .",

    "the convention for dashed and dotted lines is that lines that are behind one layer of the cylinder are dashed , and lines that are behind two layers are dotted .",
    "the points where @xmath122 intersects @xmath113 ( denoted as black dots ) are the ( zero - dimensional ) submanifold @xmath125 .",

    "suppose instead that the intersections are transversal up to the @xmath118th step , at which step @xmath119 and @xmath120 intersect nontransversally .",
    "there are two ways this could happen .",
    "first , it could be that part or all of @xmath119 lies in @xmath120 , so that part or all of the intersection fails to have dimension reduced by one .",
    "if this situation were generic , it would mean that the final intersection would be greater than zero - dimensional , thus not specifying points , so the povm could not be psi - complete .",
    "second , it could be that part or all of the intersection has dimensionality reduced by more than one , as in the case of two ellipsoids touching at tangent points .",
    "this is the situation depicted in figure [ f : transversal]_a ) _ if the ellipses were replaced with surfaces of revolution about the vertical axis in the diagram .",
    "if this situation were generic , it would imply a relation between the @xmath118 remaining values , @xmath146 , and the previous values , @xmath147 ; since an arbitrary state is not subject to such a restriction , the povm could not be psi - complete .",
    "we conclude that if a measurement is to be psi - complete , a transversal intersection at every step in our process is generically necessary . in accordance with sard",
    "s theorem , a nontransversal intersection at any step could be removed by slightly perturbing the values of our constraints .",
    "now consider the final step in our process .",
    "as we have just argued , if the povm is to be psi - complete , this step generically involves the transversal intersection of a compact , one - dimensional submanifold , @xmath122 , with the hyperellipsoid @xmath113 , which is defined by eq .",

    "moreover , the hyperellipsoid @xmath113 is closed and orientable , thus splitting @xmath86 into an inside and an outside .",
    "a closed curve intersecting such a surface transversally must intersect it an even number of times , since any entrance from the outside must be paired with an exit .",
    "thus we can conclude that @xmath125 consists generically of an even number of points .",
    "we need , of course , a stronger result than this because the inversion symmetry , @xmath83 , already implies that the points in @xmath125 come in pairs .",
    "what we need to show is that @xmath125 contains at least two points with @xmath105 , but we can get this by a simple extension of the above reasoning , which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : solutions ] .",
    "let @xmath144 be the part of the hyperplane @xmath107 that lies inside or on @xmath113 .",
    "the inversion symmetry guarantees that the points in the intersection of @xmath122 with @xmath144 come in pairs , @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "the points in a pair are distinct , because an intersection at @xmath150 is forbidden by the normalization constraint .",
    "now consider the union of the @xmath105 part of @xmath113 , which we denote as @xmath151 , and @xmath144 .",
    "since this union is closed and orientable , we can conclude , just as we did above for @xmath152 , that the closed curves in @xmath122 intersect it an even number of times . since we have just established that @xmath122 intersects @xmath144 an even number of times , we find that @xmath122 intersects @xmath151 an even number of times .",
    "this means that the final set , @xmath125 , generically has an even number of points with @xmath105 , corresponding to distinct pure states consistent with the outcome probabilities .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem  1 , because this generic ambiguity , at least two - fold , shows that a povm with @xmath1 elements can not be psi - complete .",
    "in this section we construct an explicit example of a psi - complete povm with @xmath2 outcomes , thus showing the sufficiency of this number of outcomes for psi - completeness .",

    "we can always make @xmath158 a positive operator by choosing @xmath43 and @xmath44 small enough . notice that this povm has @xmath2 elements , as promised .",

    "the first outcome probability for the povm  ( [ eq:2dpovm ] ) is @xmath163 from which we get the ( positive ) amplitude of the state @xmath164 , @xmath165 the remaining outcome probabilities ( except for the throw - away outcome ) are @xmath166 for @xmath167 . except for states with @xmath168 ( a set of measure zero ) , these , too",
    ", can be immediately inverted to give the remaining amplitudes , @xmath169 this completes the ( trivial ) demonstration that the povm  ( [ eq:2dpovm ] ) is psi - complete .",
    "the inversion procedure fails on the @xmath170-dimensional subspace orthogonal to @xmath164 , where @xmath168 .",
    "there is a simple way to handle this failure in a tomographic procedure , i.e. , in a sequence of measurements of this povm , made on many identical copies of the same system , with the outcome probabilities estimated from the outcome frequencies .",
    "all one has to do is to precede the tomographic procedure with a single premeasurement in the basis @xmath171 .",
    "whatever the outcome of this premeasurement , that outcome has nonzero probability , so we can choose it to be the state  @xmath172 .    notice that after determining @xmath75 , the reconstruction of the remaining amplitudes @xmath78 is reduced to solving linear equations .",
    "this transformation of a fundamentally quadratic inversion into a linear one is the reason it is so easy to show that the povm  ( [ eq:2dpovm ] ) is psi - complete .",
    "the key to this transformation is that the probabilities  ( [ eq : pxy ] ) have no terms that are quadratic in the amplitudes @xmath78 .",
    "this , in turn , is a consequence of having the unit operator in the `` middle '' povm elements , @xmath173 and @xmath174 , since for normalized states , these unit operators always put a 1 into the corresponding outcome probabilities .",
    "we ca nt just leave the unit operator out , because we have to put something there to make the middle povm elements positive .",
    "suppose , for example , that we tried to make the middle povm elements rank one by changing them to @xmath175 and @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is the projection operator onto the subspace spanned by @xmath164 and @xmath154 .",
    "then the probabilities  ( [ eq : pxy ] ) become @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "the quadratic term @xmath180 introduces a generic two - fold ambiguity into the determination of each of the amplitudes @xmath78 , which makes the povm not psi - complete .",
    "we should stress that the role of the povm  ( [ eq:2dpovm ] ) is solely to demonstrate that @xmath2 outcomes are sufficient for psi - completeness , because the presence of the unit operator in the middle povm elements makes this povm a poor candidate indeed for an actual tomographic procedure .",
    "the unit operators mean that the middle outcomes all have nearly the same probability , with only a weak dependence on the amplitudes @xmath78 .",
    "it is from this weak dependence that one must extract the amplitudes , and this makes a tomographic procedure based on this povm very inefficient .",
    "weigert @xcite has described a quite different way of making a psi - complete measurement , which we can manipulate to produce a single psi - complete povm with @xmath2 outcomes .",
    "considering the system to be a spin-@xmath38 particle ( @xmath39 ) , weigert first shows that the probabilities for two spin components , @xmath181 and @xmath182 , along infinitesimally different directions , are sufficient to determine a generic pure state up to @xmath183 ambiguities .",
    "he then shows that the ambiguities can be resolved by knowing just the expectation value of the spin component @xmath184 along the direction @xmath185 orthogonal to @xmath41 and @xmath186 .    to describe this scheme ,",
    "let @xmath187 denote the eigenvector of @xmath181 with eigenvalue @xmath118 .",
    "notice that @xmath188 is a potential povm element whose expectation value contains the same information as the expectation value of @xmath189 .",
    "weigert describes getting the expectation value of @xmath189 in the standard way from measurements of that spin component , but we can get the same information directly by including @xmath190 in a povm . furthermore , since the measurements of @xmath181 and @xmath191 are separately normalized , we can amalgamate two projectors , one from each measurement , into a single povm element without losing any information .",
    "if we put all this together , weigert s work shows that a generic pure state is determined by the expectation values of the operators @xmath192",
    "this list contains @xmath2 povm elements , whose expectation values are psi - complete , but the list does not constitute a povm because the elements do nt sum to @xmath193 . to turn the list into a povm",
    ", we use a trick mentioned in the introduction in the context of ic - povms .",
    "suppose we have a set of positive operators , @xmath194 , which are psi - complete in that their expectation values are sufficient to reconstruct a generic unnormalized vector @xmath76 up to a global phase .",
    "first form the operator @xmath18 .",
    "this operator is invertible , for if it were nt , there would be a vector @xmath195 such that @xmath196 , which would imply that @xmath197 for all values of @xmath198 ; this would mean that the expectation values of the operators @xmath16 provide no information about the amplitude @xmath199 , so the operators would not be informationally complete .",
    "now define new operators @xmath17 .",
    "these operators are positive and sum to @xmath193 , so they make up a povm ; moreover , they are obviously psi - complete .",
    "it is also worth noting that if @xmath16 is rank - one , so is @xmath4 .    although it is easy to calculate @xmath200 for the list  ( [ eq : wlist ] ) , it is not very enlightening to calculate the povm elements .",
    "we simply note that the trick can be applied to the list  ( [ eq : wlist ] ) , thereby turning weigert s psi - complete measurements into a minimal psi - complete povm  and , moreover , one with @xmath21 rank - one povm elements .",
    "the price of this transformation is that the measurement no longer corresponds to just measuring a few spin components .",
    "one might be tempted to apply this trick to the povm elements  ( [ eq:2dpovm ] ) , without the throw - away @xmath158 , since the probability for outcome @xmath158 never appears in the inversion procedure .",
    "we know this ca nt work , however , because the result would be a psi - complete povm with @xmath1 elements , contradicting the results of sec .",
    "[ sec : necessity ] . the reason it does nt work is that the inversion procedure assumes normalized pure states , and the trick only works if the inversion works for normalized and unnormalized states .",
    "for unnormalized states , the throw - away ca nt be discarded because it is required to fix the normalization .",
    "in this section we consider psi - complete povms whose povm elements are all of rank one , i.e. , multiples of one - dimensional projectors .",
    "we do nt know the minimal number of elements in a rank - one psi - complete povm .",

    "notice that @xmath207    we now consider the following povm elements , numbering @xmath3 , @xmath208 where we assume @xmath209 .",
    "the first thing to show is that these povm elements are sufficient to reconstruct a generic unnormalized pure state @xmath76 .",
    "we begin by determining @xmath210 from the probability for the first povm element , @xmath211 . as we work through the remaining amplitudes ,",
    "suppose that we have determined @xmath212 and are now trying to get @xmath78 from the three povm probabilities @xmath213 writing these three probabilities out , it becomes clear that they determine @xmath78 , provided @xmath214 .",
    "the only hitch in this method is that we get stuck if any @xmath78 except the last is zero , so we have a set of @xmath215 @xmath170-dimensional subspaces where the method fails .",
