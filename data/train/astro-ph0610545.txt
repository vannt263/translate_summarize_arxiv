    "blazars are the most extreme variety of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) known .",
    "their signal properties include irregular , rapid variability ; high optical polarization ; core - dominant radio morphology ; apparent superluminal motion ; flat ( @xmath1 ; @xmath2 ) radio spectra ; and a broad continuum extending from the radio through the gamma - rays @xcite .",
    "blazar properties are consistent with relativistic beaming , that is bulk relativistic motion of the emitting plasma at small angles to the line of sight , which gives rise to strong amplification and collimation in the observer s frame .",
    "the blazar class includes flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) and bl  lacertae objects , which are thought to be the `` beamed '' counterparts of high- and low - luminosity radio galaxies , respectively . that is , according to unified schemes blazars are simply radio galaxies with their radio jets forming a small angle with respect to the line of sight @xcite .",
    "this also explains the intrinsic rarity of the blazar class .",
    "two blazar properties are most interesting for this paper and this conference : 1 . their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , which are usually explained in terms of synchrotron and inverse compton emission , the former dominating at lower energies , the latter being relevant at higher energies ; 2 .",
    "the fact that blazars are sites of very high energy phenomena , with bulk lorentz factors up to @xmath3 ( corresponding to velocities @xmath4c ) and photon energies reaching the tev range . as a consequence , and despite their small numbers , blazars dominate the high energy sky . indeed , the large majority of extragalactic sources detected by egret are blazars ( see various papers at this conference ) , while 12/13 of the extragalactic tev sources detected so far are bl lacs @xcite .",
    "the main difference between the two blazar classes lies in their emission lines , which are strong and quasar - like for fsrq and weak or in some cases outright absent in bl  lacs .",
    "another difference between the two classes , which has been a puzzle for quite some time , relates to their sed .",
    "bl lacs have a large range in synchrotron peak frequency , @xmath0 , which is the frequency at which the synchrotron energy output is maximum ( i.e. , the frequency of the peak in a @xmath5 plot ) .",
    "although the @xmath0 distribution appears now to be continuous , it is still useful to divide bl lacs into low - energy peaked ( lbl ) , with @xmath6 in the ir / optical bands , and high - energy peaked ( hbl ) sources , with @xmath0 in the uv / x - ray bands @xcite .",
    "the location of the synchrotron peaks suggests in fact a different origin for the x - ray emission of the two classes .",
    "namely , an extension of the synchrotron emission responsible for the lower energy continuum in hbl , which display steep ( @xmath7 ) x - ray spectra , and inverse compton emission in lbl , which have harder ( @xmath8 ) spectra @xcite . given their high - energy peak ,",
    "hbl are more easily selected in the x - ray band and have relatively large x - ray - to - radio flux ratios , @xmath9 .",
    "lbl , on the other hand , have smaller @xmath10 values and are typically selected in the radio band .",
    "the puzzling thing was that no such distinction appeared for fsrq .",
    "all known fsrq were of the `` l '' type , i.e. , with low ( ir / optical energies ) @xmath0 and , therefore , x - ray band dominated by inverse compton emission .",
    "no `` hfsrq '' ( as these sources have been labelled ) , i.e. , fsrq with high ( uv / x - ray energies ) @xmath0 seemed to exist until a few years ago .",
    "it is important to point out up front that the determination of @xmath0 is not straightforward , as it requires building the sed with a decently large number of data points across a large energy range .",
    "moreover , being blazars variable at all wavelengths , the non - simultaneous seds which are quite often used imply a further uncertainty on @xmath0 .",
    "a `` proxy '' which is sometimes adopted is @xmath9 , which , as mentioned above , depends on @xmath0 ( equivalently , the effective radio  x - ray spectral index @xmath11 , normally defined between 5 ghz and 1 kev , is also used ) . for consistency with previous work , which we refer to",
    "extensively , we have adopted the values @xmath12 km / s / mpc and @xmath13 .",
    "the so - called `` blazar sequence '' was proposed in 1998 by two papers @xcite .",
    "one of the main results of @xcite is given in their fig .",
    "7 , which plots various powers vs. @xmath0 for three blazar samples : the 2 jy fsrq ( radio - selected ) , the 1 jy bl lacs ( radio - selected ) , and the _ einstein _ slew survey bl lacs ( x - ray selected ) .",
    "an anti - correlation was apparent , with the most powerful sources having relatively small synchrotron peak frequencies and the least powerful ones having the highest @xmath0 values .",
    "the theoretical interpretation to this anti - correlation was given by @xcite .",
    "the frequency of the peak of the synchrotron emission is related to the electron energy , as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the magnetic field , @xmath16 is the doppler factor , and @xmath17 is a characteristic electron energy which is determined by a competition between accelerating and cooling processes . since in more powerful sources the energy density ( @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the characteristic size of the jet ) is higher , the emitting particles have a larger probability of losing energy and therefore are subjected to more cooling .",
    "this translates into a lower value of @xmath17 and therefore of @xmath0 .",
    "7 of @xcite summarizes the blazar sequence by plotting @xmath17 vs. energy density , @xmath20 , for hbl ( high @xmath17 - low @xmath20 ) , lbl ( lower @xmath17 - higher @xmath20 ) , and fsrq ( hpq and lpq in their notation ; low @xmath17 - high @xmath20 ) .",
    "the blazar sequence makes very specific predictions .",
    "namely :    1 .   since fsrq are more powerful than bl lacs ( which is explained by the fact that fsrq are thought to be the beamed version of high power radio - galaxies , the so - called fanaroff - riley type ii ) , an anti - correlation between power and @xmath0 implies that fsrq with high @xmath6 should not exist .",
    "this would then explain the puzzle of the missing hfsrq .",
    "the immediate implication is that , since all known bl lacs with tev detections ( twelve as of this meeting ) are of the hbl type , tev detectors should not expect to observe any fsrq .",
    "a complication is that tev photons interact with background infrared photons to produce electron - positron pairs and get therefore depleted , the more so the larger the distance of the emitter .",
    "nevertheless these sources , if they existed , would increase the statistics and , being at higher redshifts than bl lacs , would better constrain the ir background and , therefore , the star formation history in the universe @xcite ; 2 .",
    "since low - luminosity sources are more numerous than high - luminosity ones ( as all observed luminosity functions are of the type @xmath21 , with @xmath22 ) , an anti - correlation between power and @xmath0 implies that hbl should be more numerous than lbl .",
    "the physical implications are two - fold : a ) a simple demographical one relevant , for example , for deep surveys ; b ) strong constraints on jet physics . in fact , as @xmath23 , if high @xmath0 values were indeed more common , this would mean that nature prefers certain types of jets and therefore some special combination of these parameters , a fact certainly worth of a thorough investigation .",
    "these very specific predictions lend themselves to be tested , at least in theory , relatively simply .",
    "namely , one can prove or disprove the sequence by :    1 .",
    "checking the power - @xmath0 anti - correlation ; 2 .   finding",
    "any `` forbidden '' objects , that is outliers from the correlation ( high @xmath0 - high power and/or low @xmath0 - low power blazars ) ; 3 .   counting sources ; that is , are hbl really more numerous than lbl ?",
    "( and is this consistent with the x - ray background ? )",
    "i will discuss these tests in detail in the following .",
    "before discussing any test of the anti - correlation , it is important to see in detail how the original plot was derived .",
    "two bl lac samples had been used by @xcite , one radio- and one x - ray - selected , and one fsrq sample .",
    "these samples had been assembled in an independent and somewhat different way , especially so as regards the selection band .",
    "two caveats need then to be kept in mind : 1 .",
    "it is always dangerous to infer parameter dependencies by plotting samples selected in an inhomogeneous way , particularly if one of the parameters depends on the selection method as in this case ( most hbl are x - ray selected while most lbl are radio - selected ) . indeed , none of the individual samples shown in fig .",
    "7 of @xcite showed the claimed anti - correlation between power and @xmath0 , which was only apparent by combining the three samples ; 2 .",
    "the only fsrq sample was radio - selected .",
    "as the objects with the largest @xmath0 in the plot were x - ray selected bl lacs , one might argue that the lack of high @xmath0 - high power sources was due to the lack of x - ray selected fsrq .    in any case",
    ", it is clear that an independent check for the existence of this anti - correlation needed to be carried out .",
    "this has been done by various groups , whose results i am going to review next in chronological order .    the deep x - ray radio blazar survey ( dxrbs )",
    "uses a double x - ray / radio selection and contains mostly fsrq @xcite .",
    "dxrbs is at present the faintest and largest flat - spectrum radio sample with nearly complete ( @xmath24 ) identifications down to fluxes @xmath25 times fainter than previous radio and x - ray surveys @xcite .",
    "therefore , it obviates to the selection effects present in the samples used by @xcite .",
    "the dxrbs radio power - @xmath0 plot is shown in fig .",
    "[ lrnupeak ] , which shows no correlation between the two parameters , a huge scatter , reaching 4 orders of magnitude in power , and outliers , that is sources occupying regions of this plot which were empty in the original one by @xcite .",
    "in particular , of the 21 bl lacs with @xmath26 hz and redshift information , @xmath27 `` invade '' the low - power part ( @xmath28 w / hz ) of the plot .",
    "the class blazar survey has been used by @xcite to study the radio power - @xmath11 correlation . as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ intro ] , this latter parameter is a proxy for @xmath0 .",
    "their fig .",
    "7 shows that , contrary to the predictions of the blazar sequence , many sources at relatively low power and with @xmath29 ( that is , relatively large @xmath9 ) were found .",
    "in other words , even the class sample shows the presence of low - power ",
    "low-@xmath0 bl lacs .",
    "one complication with this result , however , is the fact that the relationship between @xmath11 and @xmath0 is not very tight ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "11 of @xcite ) .",
    "the 200 mjy sample was used by @xcite to study the radio power - @xmath0 correlation .",
    "their fig .",
    "4 shows a large number of sources with @xmath30 hz and @xmath31 erg / s , whereas none were found in @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is no correlation between the two parameters and a large scatter , reaching almost 5 orders of magnitude in power at a given @xmath0 , is present .",
    "the seds for a large , heterogeneous sample of bl lacs taken from the veron - cetty & veron bl lac catalogue @xcite and visible from the metshhovi radio observatory were assembled by @xcite .",
    "their fig .",
    "3 shows an anti - correlation between radio power and @xmath0 , a huge scatter , reaching 5 orders of magnitude in power , and many outliers as compared to fig .",
    "7 of @xcite , especially in the low - power  low@xmath0 region .",
    "the situation of the radio power - @xmath0 anti - correlation , as inferred by these studies , can then be thus summarised :    1 .",
    "no radio power - @xmath0 anti - correlation is present when homogeneous , well - defined samples are used .",
    "only when putting together objects from various surveys is such an anti - correlation observed .",
    "this points to selection effects being at the origin of the original anti - correlation ; 2 .   for all studies ,",
    "the scatter is huge , reaching 4 - 5 orders of magnitude in power at a given @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , even if there were an anti - correlation , it could not be very tight ; 3 .",
    "outliers , that is sources which occupy regions of the plot which were empty in the original version , have been found by all studies .",
    "it is fair to say , though , that these are mostly in the low - power  low@xmath6 region .",
    "this last point is quite relevant . when using samples at lower fluxes than those used by @xcite , one is sampling sources which , by being fainter , could also be less beamed and therefore less powerful .",
    "hence , one could expect some of the sources above the horizontal dotted line in fig .",
    "7 of @xcite ( see also fig .",
    "[ lrnupeak ] ) to move below the line in deeper surveys @xcite .",
    "it is then especially important to look for the other type of outliers , the hfsrq , that is high - power  high@xmath0 blazars .",
    "how does one look for hfsrq , that is high - power blazars with high @xmath6 ? the steps are , at least in theory , simple enough .",
    "namely :    1 .",
    "start from x - ray selected samples , as hbl are mostly found in the x - ray band ; 2 .",
    "select suitable candidates by looking in regions of parameter space which are known to be occupied by hbl .",
    "for example , those defined by large @xmath9 ; 3 .   after pre - selection ,",
    "build the sed .",
    "one should check that , since we are dealing with quasars , which are known for their ultraviolet excess , any high - energy synchrotron peak is not due to the ultraviolet `` bump '' ; 4 .   as a final step , confirmation by x - ray observations is recommended . as discussed in sect .",
    "[ intro ] , in fact , for a source to be an hfsrq its x - ray spectrum should be synchrotron dominated and , therefore , relatively steep ( @xmath32 ) or , at least , concave ( which would suggest that the x - ray band is sampling the synchrotron to inverse compton transition ) .    however , all of the above is quite complex and time - consuming to put into practice .",
    "in fact , to the best of my knowledge , only our group has tackled this problem to this level of details .",
    "this is described partly in @xcite , to which the reader is referred for more details . in brief , as an initial step towards studying the broad - band properties of our sources , we first derived their @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath11 values .",
    "these are the usual rest - frame spectral indices defined between 5 ghz , 5,000  , and 1 kev .",
    "the fraction of sources which fall in the region of the plane within @xmath35 from the mean @xmath36 , @xmath33 , and @xmath11 values of hbl , the `` hbl box '' , derived by using all hbl in the multi - frequency agn catalog of @xcite , is @xmath37 and @xmath38 for dxrbs bl lac objects and fsrq respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ aroaox ] ) .",
    "this already shows that @xmath39 of dxrbs fsrq have broad - band colours typical of high - energy peaked bl lacs . for comparison , the 1 jy fsrq , a _ radio - selected _ sample , occupy a region of @xmath40 parameter space with @xmath11 similar to that typical of lbl .",
    "fsrq with low @xmath11 ( @xmath41 , roughly equivalent to the hbl / lbl division ) constitute only @xmath42 of the 1 jy sources with x - ray data .",
    "however , none of the 1 jy fsrq fall in the hbl box .",
    "_ bepposax _ observations of four candidate hfsrq were carried out by @xcite with mixed results : one source had an x - ray spectrum dominated by inverse compton emission , while two others had a flat x - ray spectrum with evidence of steepening at low energies .",
    "rgbj1629 + 4008 , however , was clearly synchrotron dominated in the x - ray band , with @xmath43 , which is typical of hbl .",
    "this source represents therefore the first example of confirmed hfsrq , with @xmath44 hz ( @xmath45 kev ) .",
    "it has to be pointed out , however , that , despite being an fsrq , its relatively low radio power ( @xmath46 w / hz ) places this source still in the bottom - right quadrant of fig .",
    "[ lrnupeak ] , that is , where it should be according to the blazar sequence .",
    "moreover , although clearly way above the values reached by lbl and well within the hbl range , its @xmath0 is towards the low end of the hbl distribution .",
    "the latter result has been confirmed by more extensive searches , summarized in @xcite . in short , various x - ray",
    "selected samples have been searched thoroughly , and xmm and chandra data have been taken @xcite .",
    "hfsrq , that is , broad - lined blazars with @xmath0 typical of hbl have been found , despite previous claims to the contrary ( the issue of the effect of the uv bump on the estimated value of @xmath6 has been discussed by @xcite ) .",
    "however , their maximum @xmath0 is still @xmath45 kev , while hbl reach _ typically _ @xmath47 kev and _ exceptionally _ @xmath48 kev ( as in the case of mkn 501 ; @xcite )    the most extreme case is that of the sedentary survey @xcite , which was designed to find extreme hbl , as a selection was made on @xmath10 ( roughly equivalent to @xmath49 hz ) .",
    "nineteen broad - lined agn were found , out of 169 candidates , as compared to 150 hbl , but none of them was a definite fsrq .",
    "these sources , in fact , turned out to be mostly nearby , low radio luminosity agn very close to the radio - loud / radio - quiet border .",
    "is this lack of hfsrq with high @xmath0 values telling us something about jet physics and the blazar sequence or is it still a selection effect ? recall that rgbj1629 + 4008 , and also the other three hfsrq candidates studied in @xcite , had all relatively low radio powers ( @xmath50 w / hz ) , more typical of bl lacs than of fsrq and in any case close to the low - luminosity end of the fsrq radio luminosity function @xcite .",
    "similarly , the hfsrq studied by @xcite were also of low power , reaching powers more typical of low - luminosity ( fanaroff - riley type i ) radio galaxies .",
    "one could argue that the fact that hfsrq are found at relatively low radio power is not coincidental .",
    "indeed , for a high radio power hbl - like source , the optical flux would be totally dominated by the non - thermal , featureless nuclear emission , which would make any redshift estimation a very difficult task ( see details in @xcite and fig .",
    "7 of @xcite ) . in other words",
    ", high - power hfsrq sources would lack a redshift ( which is indeed the case for many bl lacs with featureless spectra ) and therefore we would have no way of knowing that they are at high power .",
    "the situation of the search for high - power ",
    "blazars , the so - called hfsrq , can then be thus summarised :    1 .",
    "hfsrq have been found and they make up @xmath51 of the fsrq in dxrbs , which is both x - ray- and radio - selected .",
    "the previously noted absence of these sources was due to the fact that the majority of fsrq samples had been radio - selected and that no x - ray survey had looked for fsrq .",
    "2 .   despite the fact that these sources have @xmath0 values way above those reached by lbl and well within the hbl range ,",
    "their maximum @xmath0 is @xmath45 kev , below the typical ( @xmath47 kev ) , and well below the largest ( @xmath48 kev ) , values for hbl .",
    "3 .   it is still not clear if the fact that hfsrq do not reach the extreme @xmath0 values of hbl is indicative of the fact that , after all , there might be an intrinsic , physical limit to this parameter .",
    "an alternative scenario is one where really high - power ",
    "blazars have their thermal emission swamped by the non - thermal , featureless jet emission , which makes their redshift determination impossible .",
    "this explanation for the the fact that presently known hfsrq are of relatively low power can not be ruled out .    in this respect ,",
    "the discovery of a very powerful ( @xmath52 erg / s ) @xmath53 fsrq with a likely @xmath54 kev is extremely interesting and worth following up @xcite .",
    "the last test to be carried out regards the relative fraction of the bl lac subclasses .",
    "namely , are hbl more numerous than lbl , as predicted by the blazar sequence ?",
    "the problem here is that the selection band affects the selected objects , in the sense that x - ray selection finds mostly hbl , while radio selection finds mostly lbl . since the large majority of bl lac samples are either x - ray or radio selected (",
    "even optically selected ones , see @xcite , have their biases , as the optical band would preferentially select hbl ) , one would need an unbiased selection method , say a volume - limited sample .",
    "since we are still very far from having such an unbiased bl lac sample , one needs to make some assumptions and then predict the relative fraction of hbl and lbl in x - ray- and radio - selected samples .",
    "let us assume that the blazar sequence is indeed a valid representation of the truth and that , therefore , hbl are intrinsically the most numerous bl lac subclass .",
    "therefore , although initially radio selection favours lbl , the fraction of hbl in the radio band will have to increase at lower fluxes until hbl become the majority at the faintest fluxes . in the x - ray band , on the other hand , hbl are the dominant class and their fraction is expected to be basically constant .",
    "indeed , detailed predictions under a scenario where @xmath0 has an an inverse dependence on bolometric power , as required by the blazar sequence , have been worked out @xcite and conform to these simple arguments .",
    "[ sedent ] shows the integral radio number counts for the hbl sedentary sample at 1.4 ghz . for lack of deeper samples ,",
    "these were compared by @xcite to the counts for all bl lacs predicted by unified schemes and based on the radio luminosity function fitted to the 1 jy sample assuming no evolution ( fig . 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "we can now compare the hbl counts also with the observed bl lac counts from dxrbs @xcite .",
    "[ sedent ] shows that the fraction of extreme hbl is constant , as the hbl counts are parallel to the total ones .",
    "this is at variance with the predictions of the blazar sequence , according to which this fraction should increase at lower fluxes ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ sedent ] @xcite ) .",
    "the fraction of all ( and not only extreme ) hbl as a function of radio flux could not be studied until the completion of our own dxrbs sample .",
    "we show that the ratio lbl / hbl is basically constant and @xmath55 @xcite , while at the radio fluxes reached by dxrbs a value @xmath56 would be expected @xcite .",
    "the hfsrq fraction is also roughly constant with radio flux .",
    "again , this goes against what predicted by the blazar sequence .",
    "we note that a completely independent argument against the strong increase in the hbl fraction at low radio fluxes required by the blazar sequence can be made @xcite .",
    "in fact , were that the case , the blazar contribution to the soft x - ray background , estimated around @xmath57 and mostly due to the synchrotron component in hbl , would be much larger and inconsistent with observational data .",
    "the dependence of the fraction of lbl in an x - ray selected sample could also not be studied to fluxes deep enough until dxrbs came into the scene .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ xraycounts ] , which shows the integral x - ray number counts for bl lacs , adapted from @xcite , compared to our best estimate of the integral number counts of lbl in the x - ray band @xcite .",
    "the solid line represents the x - ray number counts for lbl predicted by @xcite and revised by @xcite on the assumption that hbl represent @xmath51 of the bl lac population , while the dashed line shows the predictions of @xcite normalized at high fluxes .",
    "the figure shows that the fraction of lbl in the x - ray band increases at lower fluxes , as expected if they were the dominant population .",
    "the blazar sequence , on the other hand , predicts lbl to make up a constant fraction of the total , as shown by the dashed line , in contrast with observations .",
    "i have investigated the validity of the blazar sequence and tested its predictions against recent observational data .",
    "my main conclusions are as follow :    1 .",
    "there is no anti - correlation between radio power and synchrotron peak frequency in blazars , once selection effects are properly taken into account .",
    "furthermore , outliers to the originally proposed sequence have been found , both in the low - power ",
    "low-@xmath0 and high - power  high-@xmath0 regions .",
    "2 .   the `` missing '' class of flat - spectrum radio quasars with synchrotron peak frequency in the uv / x - ray band , whose existence is not expected within the blazar sequence , has been found .",
    "contrary to the predictions of the blazar sequence , all observational data are consistent with the idea that the hbl subclass makes up a small ( @xmath58 ) minority of bl lacs .",
    "4 .   based on all of the above , the blazar sequence in its simplest form can not be valid . 5 .",
    "the point remains , however , that the maximum synchrotron peak frequency of fsrq appears to be @xmath59 times smaller than that reached by bl lacs ( but see @xcite for a possible exception to this rule ) .",
    "is this telling us something about jet physics or is it still a selection effect due to the fact that for really high - power ",
    "high-@xmath6 blazars it might be hard to get a redshift estimate ?",
    "this question could be answered by the detection of high - power , moderately high - redshift tev blazars .",

    "<S> the `` blazar sequence '' posits that the most powerful bl lacertae objects and flat - spectrum radio quasars should have relatively small synchrotron peak frequencies , @xmath0 , and that the least powerful such objects should have the highest @xmath0 values . </S>",
    "<S> this would have strong implications for our understanding of jet formation and physics and the possible detection of powerful , moderately high - redshift tev blazars . </S>",
    "<S> i review the validity of the blazar sequence by using the results of very recent surveys and compare its detailed predictions against observational data . </S>",
    "<S> i find that the blazar sequence in its simplest form is ruled out . </S>",
    "<S> however , powerful flat - spectrum radio quasars appear not to reach the @xmath0 typical of bl lacs . </S>",
    "<S> this could indeed be related to some sort of sequence , although it can not be excluded that it is instead due to a selection effect . </S>"
