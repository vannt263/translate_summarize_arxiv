    "saxj2103.5 + 4545  belongs to the sub - class of high - mass x - ray binaries known as be / x - ray binaries ( bexb ) . in these systems , a neutron star orbits around an obe companion @xcite . in a bexb ,",
    "the main source of matter available for accretion is the gaseous geometrically thin equatorial disk around the be star .",
    "the disk is fed from the material lifted from the star s photosphere by a still uncertain mechanism . in classical ( isolated )",
    "be stars , there is growing evidence that the disk is keplerian and supported by viscosity @xcite .",
    "most bexbs are transient x - ray sources that exhibit outbursts when a compact object passes close or through the be disk . correlated optical / ir / x - ray variability is often observed on time scales of months or years and generally attributed to the extension of the circumstellar disk @xcite . the outburst activity is commonly divided in two types : type i outbursts are modulated by the orbital period of the system and occur when the neutron star passes close to the disk and accretes from its outer regions .",
    "the type ii , or giant outbursts , exhibit higher x - ray luminosity close to the eddington value @xmath3 erg s@xmath1 , and are usually associated with the accretion of a substantial part of the be disk @xcite .",
    "several systems have also been observed in quiescence at x - ray luminosities in the range of @xmath4 erg s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however , pulsations were detected only in the brighter sources with longer spin periods , which are likely powered by accretion in quiescence @xcite .",
    "the compact object in saxj2103.5 + 4545  is clearly a neutron star as the observed x - ray emission is pulsed . at the time of its discovery by _ bepposax _ in february 1997 , the pulse period was @xmath5 s @xcite .",
    "since then , the neutron star exhibits a general spin - up trend , although the rate of the period change has not remained constant . occasionally , the long - term spin - up trend is interrupted by spin - down intervals @xcite .",
    "the optical companion is a moderately reddened ( @xmath6 mag ) v=14.2 b0ve star @xcite .",
    "the distance estimated from optical data is @xmath76.5 kpc @xcite , while x - ray observations suggest a lower value of @xmath74.5 kpc @xcite .",
    "saxj2103.5 + 4545  has a moderately eccentric orbit with @xmath8 and an orbital period of @xmath9 days @xcite .",
    "its relatively long spin period and relatively short orbital period locates saxj2103.5 + 4545  in the wind - fed supergiant region of the @xmath10 diagram @xcite .",
    "saxj2103.5 + 4545  shows extended bright and faint x - ray states that last for several months @xcite . during the faint state ,",
    "the x - ray intensity does not change significantly with orbital phase @xcite , and the spin frequency of the neutron star remains fairly constant @xcite or slightly decreases @xcite . in this state",
    "the b - type companion shows h@xmath11  in absorption @xcite , which signifies the recession of the circumstellar be disk .",
    "the average x - ray luminosity in this state is @xmath12 erg s@xmath1 in the 330 kev range ( assuming a distance of 6.5 kpc ) .",
    "the bright state generally starts with a sharp flare that lasts for one to two orbital cycles .",
    "this flare is then followed by a progressive increase in the x - ray intensity until a maximum is reached at about one order of magnitude brighter than in the faint state . during the bright states , the neutron star spins up @xcite ,",
    "shows moderate outbursts modulated by the orbital period @xcite , and displays h@xmath11  line in emission @xcite , which indicates the growth of the be disk .",
    "the x - ray luminosity at the peak of the outbursts ranges between @xmath13 erg s@xmath1 , while at the peak of the flare the luminosity is typically a factor of 2 higher .",
    "the x - ray spectra of the bright state are distinctly harder than those of the faint state @xcite .",
    "the 1150 kev x - ray spectra are well represented by an absorbed ( @xmath14 @xmath15 ) power law ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) plus and exponential cutoff at high energy ( @xmath18 kev ) .",
    "in addition , a cool iron fluorescence line is observed at 6.4kev . at lower energy ,",
    "a soft component consistent with blackbody emission ( @xmath19 kev ) has been shown to be significant in an _ xmm - newton _ observation during a bright state @xcite .",
    "this observation also revealed a 44 mhz quasi - periodic oscillation .    in this work we present the results of a timing and spectral analysis of a _",
    "observation aimed specifically to explore the characteristics of the x - ray emission at very low accretion rates .",
    "the source is expected to be in x - ray quiescence when the material in the disk dissipates .",
    "thanks to our regular monitoring of the evolution of the h@xmath11  line in the optical spectrum of saxj2103.5 + 4545 , we were able to trigger the x - ray observations when the line appeared in absorption .",
    "the source indeed turned out to be in deep x - ray quiescence with a flux more than two orders of magnitude lower than the faint state previously reported in _",
    "rxte _ observations and almost four orders of magnitude lower than during the bright state .",

    "a strong emission asymmetric h@xmath11  profile with an equivalent width @xmath28   was measured , indicating the presence of the circumstellar disk .",
    "the disk also affected the shape of the hei line at 6678  , which appeared with a double peaked emission profile . about a year later , both lines were observed in absorption , although a very weak peak emerging from the center of the line was observed . this type of profile is known as central quasi - emission peak ( cqe ) and is an indication of a highly debilitated disk ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . on january 6 , 2014",

    "however , variability analysis of the event data using the gregory - loredo algorithm ( implemented in ciao tool _ glvary _ ) suggests that the observed emission is consistent with constant rate ( the probability of a variable signal is less than 5% )",
    ".    the power spectrum of the source is also consistent with white noise with the exception of the strong peak detected at the expected period of saxj2103.5 + 4545(see fig  [ spin ] ) .",
    "indeed , the power spectrum of the 1 - 10kev light curve with 1s time bin size reveals a coherent modulation with maximum power at @xmath35 hz , which corresponds to a pulse period of @xmath36 s ( fig .",
    "[ spin ] ) . a more accurate determination of the spin period was obtained through the pulse phase connection technique @xcite .",
    "we found the pulse period to be consistent with constant value of @xmath37s ( at @xmath38 confidence level ) .",

    "the fraction of pulsed emission ( defined as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 , are the minimum and maximum intensity of the pulse profile ) is relatively high ( 50 - 80% ) and independent of energy within the statistical uncertainties . for the 0.510 kev band the pulsed fraction is @xmath42% .",
    "similar values have been reported for saxj2103.5 + 4545  from _ xmm - newton _ observations at three orders of magnitude higher luminosity , although the reported pulse shape was different ( see fig . 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "the _ xmm - newton _",
    "profiles are more asymmetric with a narrow peak followed by a broader one .",
    "the overall _ chandra _ profiles are more sinusoidal , have only one peak , and cover a larger fraction of the pulse phase with no sharp features .",
    "the source spectrum in the 0.2 - 10kev energy range can be fitted ( @xmath43 for 7 degrees of freedom ) with a single component absorbed blackbody .",
    "the blackbody temperature @xmath44kev , and radius of @xmath45 , assuming a distance of 6.5 kpc , are compatible with the emission from the polar caps of the neutron star .",
    "the absorption column of @xmath46 ( assuming abundances by @xcite ) is roughly compatible with interstellar absorption in the direction of the source ( @xmath47 @xcite ) .",
    "the quality of the fit above 6 kev is slightly improved with the inclusion of a power law tail .",
    "however , the limited statistics at high energies makes the parameters of the power law unconstrained and the overall improvement in terms of @xmath48 not significant .",
    "the 0.510 kev unabsorbed x - ray flux is @xmath49 ergs @xmath15 s@xmath1 , which implies an x - ray luminosity of @xmath50 ergs s@xmath1 , assuming a distance of 6.5 kpc @xcite , or @xmath51 ergs s@xmath1 , if the distance of 4.5 kpc from x - ray studies is used @xcite . in either case , this is the lowest luminosity at which x - ray pulsations have been detected in the quiescent state of an accreting pulsar .",
    "the observational properties and evolution of accreting pulsars are to a large extent defined by the interaction of the magnetosphere of the neutron star with the accreting matter .",
    "the magnetosphere size is defined by the magnetic field strength of the neutron star and the ram pressure of the infalling plasma , and becomes large at low accretion rates . for a rotating neutron star",
    "this implies that at some point the velocity of the magnetic field lines at the magnetospheric boundary will exceed local keplerian velocity and the accretion will be inhibited @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emission is expected to switch off at this point .",
    "further interaction with infalling plasma leads to a spin - down of the neutron star , which is believed to be the key mechanism behind the relatively long observed periods of accreting pulsars ( compared with expected birth periods ) .",
    "pulsed emission at luminosities @xmath52 erg s@xmath1 has been observed in three systems so far @xcite . at least in two occasions , 1a0535 + 262 @xcite and igrj21343 + 4738 @xcite ,",
    "x - ray pulsed emission was detected during an apparent disk - loss phase .",
    "saxj2103.5 + 4545  is the third case of pulsations detected during the absence of the be disk , but it is the first time that x - ray pulsations are detected at a luminosity level of @xmath53 erg s@xmath1 in the energy range 0.510 kev ( see table  [ lowlum ] ) . in what follows we discuss possible mechanisms that may account for the observed high - energy emission from saxj2103.5 + 4545",

    "the long spin period of saxj2103.5 + 4545  and the detection of x - ray pulsations put this source along with 1a 0535 + 26 , 4u 1145619 , and 1a 1118615 , in a category of systems with accretion powered quiescent emission @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there is no direct estimate of the magnetic field of the neutron star in saxj2103.5 + 4545 , so it is not clear whether it is in the centrifugally inhibited propeller state .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that pulsed emission is detected suggests that this is likely not the case .",
    "we can turn the argument around and derive an upper limit on the magnetic field assuming that the source does not enter the centrifugally inhibited state . for a source distance of 6.5 kpc ,",
    "@xmath65 s , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 erg s@xmath1 , the magnetic field must be @xmath68 g. for higher magnetic fields , @xmath69 and the accreting matter would no longer reach the neutron star surface because it would be spun away by the fast rotation of the magnetosphere .",
    "it is interesting to compare this value with estimates of the magnetic field from the spin evolution history of the pulsar .",
    "based on the correlation of the accreting luminosity and the spin - up rate and the @xcite model , various authors @xcite have estimated the magnetic field to be @xmath70 g , i.e. the accretion should be inhibited . on the other hand , @xcite obtained @xmath71 g. the uncertainty mainly stems from the distance , which is also a parameter obtained from the fit to the pulse period derivative - luminosity correlation .",
    "a magnetic field strength above @xmath72 g requires a distance to the source @xmath73 kpc .",
    "if the distance of 6.5 kpc obtained from optical observations @xcite is considered , then @xmath71 g @xcite , and the observed x - ray emission might be powered by accretion . in the absence of the be disk , accretion",
    "likely proceeds directly from the stellar wind of the companion .",
    "alternatively , the so - called `` dead accretion disks '' proposed by @xcite might represent another source of matter for accretion .",

    "in contrast , the _ chandra _ power spectrum is consistent with white noise with the exception of the pulsation peak .    of course , with @xmath113 photons detected from the source this might be simply due to the insufficient statistics . to clarify whether this is the case ,",
    "we have compared our _ chandra _ results with the _ xmm - newton _ observation of saxj2103.5 + 4545  at higher flux level ( obsid 0149550401 ) where the statistics is much better and low frequency noise is apparent . from",

    "we argue , therefore , that the observed change in the power spectrum is likely real and might imply that accretion is not responsible for the observed _ chandra _ flux .",
    "another scenario that has been put forward to explain the quiescent emission of accreting neutron star is deep crustal heating @xcite . during the accretion phase , the crust of a neutron star is heated by nuclear reactions ( mainly by beta captures and pycnonuclear reactions ) . this heat is conducted inwards , heating the core , and outwards , where it is emitted as thermal emission from the surface . after the accreting active period",
    ", the crust of a neutron star cools by x - ray emission until it reaches thermal equilibrium with the core emission corresponding to the quiescent state .",

    "here we assumed the canonical mass and radius of a neutron star and maximum efficiency in the conversion of luminosity into mass accretion rate .",

    "the problem with the incandescent neutron star scenario is that the blackbody temperature is too high , and the size of the emitting region is too small to be the entire surface of the neutron star ( but see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "the relatively high temperature thermal spectrum , in combination with the large pulse fraction and broad pulse profiles indicate that the emission arises from a rotating region which is hotter ( and more luminous ) than the rest of the surface of the pulsar .",
    "thus non - uniform cooling , primarily through the polar regions , has to be invoked for this scenario to remain valid .",
    "the most obvious explanation is that the observed emission comes from the polar cap , which could be heated by sporadic accretion .",
