    "the t2k ( tokai - to - kamioka ) experiment  @xcite is a long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment .",
    "an intense muon neutrino beam is produced by using the proton beam at ( japan proton accelerator research complex ) , tokai .",
    "a train of eight  bunches of protons is extracted as a spill from the proton synchrotron main ring to the neutrino beamline .",
    "the bunch width is 58  nsec , the bunch interval is 581  nsec , and the spill cycle is 3.5  seconds .",
    "the proton beam is transported to and impinges on the graphite target to produce charged pions .",
    "the pions are focused by three magnetic horns pulsed with 320  ka .",
    "the pions enter the decay volume and decay mainly into pairs of a muon and a muon neutrino .",
    "the neutrinos before oscillation are measured by the near detector ( nd280 ) at . after traveling 295  km ,",
    "they are detected by the super - kamiokande detector  @xcite ( ) in the kamioka observatory .",
    "one of the novel aspects of the t2k experiment is that it has an off - axis beam configuration , that is , the neutrino beam is aimed at a direction away from by 2.5  degrees ( fig .",
    "[ fig : beamline ] ) .",
    "this configuration makes the neutrino energy spectrum measured at narrower  @xcite than one in a conventional on - axis beam configuration .",
    "the narrow - band beam maximizes the sensitivity to the neutrino oscillation .",
    "the neutrino beam energy , however , varies sensitively as a function of the off - axis angle .",
    "therefore , it is important to monitor and control the beam direction precisely ; the beam direction is required to be aimed within 1  mrad .        to monitor the beam intensity and direction ,",
    "the muon monitor is placed in the muon pit , which is just downstream of the beam dump and 18.5  m under the ground .",
    "the distance from the proton target to the muon monitor is 118  m. the muon monitor measures a position profile of muons produced along with neutrinos from the same parent pions .",
    "the neutrino beam direction is measured as a direction from the proton target to the center of the muon profile .",
    "a muon beam is also used to monitor the neutrino beam intensity and direction in other accelerator neutrino experiments  @xcite . in the numi ( neutrinos at the main injector ) neutrino beamline  @xcite at fermi national accelerator laboratory ( fnal ) , ionization chambers filled with pure he gas are used for muon monitors . the numi ionization chamber  @xcite was referred to on our ionization chamber design .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : requirement ] , the requirements for the muon monitor are described with the properties of the t2k muon beam . in sec .  [",
    "sec : instruments ] , the design of the muon monitor detectors and instruments is described . in sec .",
    "[ sec : beam test ] , the performances of the detectors measured in beam tests are described .",
    "the requirements for the muon monitor are :    1 .   to monitor the stability of the neutrino beam intensity with a precision better than 3% by measuring the muon beam intensity ; 2 .   to measure the neutrino beam direction with a precision better than 0.25  mrad , which corresponds to a 3-cm precision of the muon profile center ; 3 .   to measure the beam intensity and direction on a bunch - by - bunch basis ; 4 .   to measure the intense muon beam of @xmath0-@xmath1  /@xmath2/bunch",
    "; 5 .   to be tolerant of radiation and resistant to activation ; 6 .   to run stably to minimize deadtime due to repair .",
    "a muon energy threshold for the beam dump is chosen to minimize the hadron flux at the muon monitor while keeping the sensitivity to the neutrino beam direction ; only muons with energy above 5  gev can go through the beam dump and reach the muon monitor .",
    "an expected profile of charged particles in a monte carlo simulation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mumon profile ] .",
    "it is close to a gaussian distribution with a sigma of approximately 1  m around the beam center . to reconstruct the profile ,",
    "the muon monitor is equipped with 49  sensors in a @xmath3  @xmath2 plane .",
    "the number of charged particles at the profile center is estimated at @xmath4  /@xmath2/spill for @xmath5  protons / spill .",
    "the expected ratio of the muons to all the charged particles is around 87% and the remaining percentage is predominantly due to @xmath6-rays knocked out by the muons .",
    "an absorbed dose at the muon monitor is estimated at about 100  kgy for a 100-day operation with the proton beam power .",
    "the muon intensity is monitored by measuring a sum of the 49 sensor signals .",
    "the error on the intensity monitoring comes from the deviation from the detector s linearity against the muon intensity and stability , which have to be kept within 3% in total .",
    "the muon profile is measured by using the relative signal of each sensor .",
    "therefore , the error on the beam direction measurement comes from relative gain differences among the sensors in addition to the linearity and stability . to achieve the requirement ( 2 ) , each sensor should measure the muon intensity within 4% precision .",
    "a schematic view of the muon monitor is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : mumon ] and the photograph is in fig .  [ fig : photo mumon ] .",
    "the muon monitor consists of two independent detector systems : an array of ionization chambers and another array of silicon pin photodiodes . in each array , there are @xmath7 sensors at intervals , also on the aluminum support enclosure .",
    "the two different types of detectors provide redundant and complementary measurements .",
    "almost all components of the muon monitor in the muon pit are made out of radiation tolerant and low - activation materials such as polyimide , peek@xmath8 , ceramic , aluminum and so on .",
    "epdm has the lowest radiation dose limit of @xmath9  gy  @xcite among the materials in the muon pit except the silicon pin photodiodes .",
    "the radiation tolerance of the photodiode is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : silicon ] and [ sec : silicon radiation ] .",
    "other instruments , like the readout electronics and high voltage ( hv ) units , are put in an electronics hut on the ground level .",
    "the ionization chamber array consists of seven ionization chambers .",
    "a drawing of the ionization chamber is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chamber ] .",
    "each ionization chamber contains seven sensors .",
    "the sensors sit on a long aluminum tray at an interval of 250  mm .",
    "the tray is inserted into a @xmath10  mm@xmath11 aluminum tube . at each end of the tube , aluminum flanges 235  mm in diameter are welded .",
    "other aluminum flanges are attached to them and seal the tube with o - rings ( seal@xmath12 jis ) made of inconel@xmath12 and aluminum .",
    "gas flows through tubes welded to the flanges . on the bottom side flange , fourteen feedthrough connectors ( lemo@xmath12 swh.0s ) for both signal and hv",
    "cables are mounted .",
    "the lemo feedthrough is sealed with an o - ring made of epdm . at the top in three out of the seven ionization chambers , a pt100 resistance thermometer ( prt ) in the four - wire configuration",
    "is installed to measure temperatures in the tubes . for the prts , four - twisted polyimide - insulated wires and feedthrough connectors are used .",
    "the insulators of those lemo and feedthrough connectors are made of peek .",
    "each sensor of the ionization chamber consists of two parallel @xmath13  mm@xmath11 alumina - ceramic plates , which are separated by 3  mm by ceramic spacers with a tolerance of 100  @xmath14 m .",
    "a drawing of the sensor is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chamber plate ] . signal ( @xmath15  mm@xmath16 ) and hv ( @xmath17  mm@xmath16 ) electrodes made of are printed on the ceramic plates .",
    "the tolerance of the electrode size is 100  @xmath14 m .",
    "the signal electrode is surrounded by a grounded electrode , which ensures uniform electric field over the signal electrode .",
    "thus ionization pairs generated only in the @xmath18  mm@xmath11 volume contribute to the signal .",
    "conductive parts except the electrodes are insulated from the gas with the peek caps , ceramic spacers and peek standoffs in order to prevent stray ionization from collecting on the conductors  @xcite .",
    "two kinds of gases are used for the ionization chambers : ar with 2% n@xmath19 for a low intensity beam and he with 1% n@xmath19 for a high intensity beam . by switching the gas from ar to he ,",
    "the signal is reduced by one order of magnitude because the ionization yields for a minimum ionization particle ( mip ) in ar and he gases at the standard conditionc and the pressure is 101.325  kpa ( absolute ) . ]",
    "( stp ) are 95.6  @xmath20 and 7.80  @xmath20  @xcite , respectively . as a result ,",
    "depletion of the signal due to recombination of electrons and ions can be avoided and the linearity of the signal to the beam intensity is guaranteed . to get a faster response , only the charge induced by electrons drift",
    "is used as a signal , and one by ions drift ( @xmath21 times slower ) is disregarded .",
    "in addition , n@xmath19 is added as a quencher , which makes the response faster .",
    "the n@xmath19 plays another important role by making the jesse effect  @xcite saturated , where the signal is insensitive to the amount of impurities in the gas .    a diagram of the gas system is drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : gas system ] .",
    "there are two feeds of the gas for the ionization chambers .",
    "each feed consists of a manifold of five gas cylinders .",
    "the gas pressure in each manifold is monitored by a pressure transducer ( ibs@xmath12 hsv-020mp ) . at the outlet of the manifold ,",
    "the gas is decompressed to 0.2  mpa by a regulator ( swagelok@xmath12 kcm ) .",
    "the regulator has a mechanism which automatically switches the gas feed from a depleted supply to the other and that ensures continuous flow of the gas .",
    "downstream of the regulator , the flow rate is set at approximately 100  cc / min .",
    "two rotameters for ar and he gas are built into the line and they are exchangeable with ball valves at their inlets and outlets .",
    "proportional relief valves ( swagelok ss - rl3s4 ) in the line release the gas to protect the gas system if the pressure accidentally reaches 200  kpa ( absolute ) .",
    "tee - type filters ( swagelok tf ) protect the gas system from particulate contaminants .",
    "stainless tubes ( 1/4  inch ) are used for the gas line to minimize outgassing from the tubes .",
    "the stable response of the ionization chamber is guaranteed by a constant gas temperature , pressure and purity .",
    "variance of the temperature and pressure leads to variance in gas density , which varies the signal size .",
    "each parameter should be kept within 1.7% to keep the signal variance within 3% .",
    "the gas temperatures in the ionization chambers are monitored by the three prts .",
    "temperatures in all of the ionization chambers are kept within 1.5@xmath22c gradient and @xmath23c variance at around 34@xmath22c .",
    "the absolute gas pressure is monitored by five pressure transducers ( ibs hbv-300kp ) , which are kept separate from the muon pit to avoid radiation .",
    "two of them monitor the pressures in the feed and exhaust lines in the facility building , and two others monitor ones near the muon pit .",
    "the fifth pressure transducer at the most downstream point is used for the pid control of a solenoid control valve ( burkert@xmath12 type2822 ) , which keeps the gas pressure in the entire gas line at @xmath24  kpa ( absolute ) .",
    "the o@xmath19 contamination is the most important index of the gas purity since oxygen captures carrier electrons and decreases the signal .",
    "it should be kept below 100  ppm in order to keep the signal depression by the electron attachment less than 1%  @xcite .",
    "the o@xmath19 contamination is monitored by an oxygen analyzer ( toray@xmath12 lc-750l ) in the exhaust line .",
    "it is kept below 2  ppm at a gas flow rate of 100  cc / min .",
    "the flow rate is monitored by a mass flow meter ( horibastec@xmath12 sef - e40 ) just downstream of the control valve .",
    "the silicon pin photodiode ( hamamatsu@xmath12 s3590 - 08 ) has an active area of @xmath25  mm@xmath16 and a depletion layer thickness of 300  @xmath14 m .",
    "the silicon layer is mounted on a ceramic base . to fully deplete the layer ,",
    "a bias voltage of 80  v is applied .",
    "the silicon pin photodiode is not tolerant of the severe radiation in the muon pit : the depletion voltage or the collected charge varies as a function of fluence . there is a report  @xcite that as the proton fluence increases , the depletion voltage of their thick silicon pin detectors decreases .",
    "the depletion voltage falls 50% at about @xmath26  protons/@xmath2 and reaches a minimum at @xmath27  protons/@xmath2 , where type inversion occurs .",
    "a proton causes approximately the same amount of radiation damage as the equivalent neutron fluence  @xcite . for the t2k muon beam",
    ", the fluence is estimated at about @xmath1  neutrons/@xmath2/spill at the beam center at 0.75  mw .",
    "therefore , the depletion voltage falls 50% in about @xmath28  spills or a month . though the photodiode is not tolerant of radiation , it is useful at the early stage of the t2k experiment when the beam intensity is low and the noise / signal ratio of the ionization chamber is large .",
    "packages of the photodiodes were designed so that installation or replacement of the photodiodes can be quickly done in situ .",
    "the photodiode is put on a peek base fixed on the support enclosure and is covered by an aluminum base . in the peek base , two sockets soldered with co - axial polyimide cables are fixed .",
    "the dimensions of the support enclosure normal to and along the beam axis are 2.51  m and 1.71  m , respectively , and the height is 4.36  m. the height of the beam axis at the silicon array is 2.87  m from the floor .",
    "the secondary beamline was surveyed from the target station to the muon pit and the beam axis in the muon pit was defined with a precision of 1  cm .",
    "the detectors are set with a precision better than 1  mm relative to the beam axis .",
    "the support enclosure has two moving stages for relative calibration of the detectors : a small one which moves an extra silicon pin photodiode just behind the silicon array and a large one which moves the ionization chambers .",
    "the small moving stage is driven horizontally and vertically along linear guides by two stepping motors ( oriental motor rk569amc ) . on the linear guides , radiation - hard lubricant ( moresco - hirad@xmath12 rg-42 - 1 )",
    "is used as grease .",
    "the beam axis position , that is the origin of the stage , is detected by limit sensors of sliding touch type ( metrol@xmath12 bp ) assembled with polyimide - insulated wires .",
    "the large stage for the ionization chambers moves horizontally and vertically along linear guides by two induction motors ( oriental motor bhi62smt and 4ik25gn ) .",
    "the position of the stage is detected by six limit sensors aligned horizontally and vertically at intervals .",
    "every limit sensor is aligned with a precision better than 1  mm .",
    "the muon monitor is thermally insulated from the muon pit because the temperature in the muon pit could vary up to 33@xmath22c .",
    "therefore , the support enclosure is covered by double aluminum panels filled with glass wool .",
    "the temperatures around the ionization chambers are kept at around 34@xmath22c by a sheathed heater and the variance of the temperatures is within @xmath29c .",
    "signals of the detectors are read by fadcs with a copper / finesse readout system  @xcite .",
    "the fadc gate opens for 7  @xmath14sec to contain all of the eight bunches .",
    "the fadc has an input impedance of 50  @xmath30 and an amplifier of or with a shaping time of 50  nsec .",
    "the fadcs are used for the ionization chambers and the for the silicon pin photodiodes .",
    "the full scale of the fadc is @xmath31  v after the amplifier and the dynamic range is 12  bits . because the signal of the silicon pin photodiode is above the fadc full scale , it is attenuated with a @xmath32-type attenuator by 0 , 15 or 30  db according to the beam intensity .",
    "the attenuator has linearity within @xmath33% up to 30  v of an input pulse and cross - talk of less than 0.02% between adjacent channels .",
    "a protection circuit is implemented for each channel and prevents surge voltage going to the fadc .",
    "it consists of two zener diodes ( renesas@xmath12 hz3a2 ) whose zener voltage is 2.6 - 2.8  v. a series of the diodes in a reverse and forward bias order is connected parallel to the fadc input .",
    "thus a voltage loaded on the fadc is restricted within @xmath34  v.    hv units ( repic@xmath12 rph-32010 ) are used to apply bias voltages to the detectors individually .",
    "low - pass filters follow the hv units to protect against surge voltage from the hv units and to ensure stable hv supply .    in the muon pit ,",
    "polyimide cables are used except for the power cables of the heater and the motors . in the other area , non",
    "- halogen cables are used .",
    "for example , co - axial non - halogen cables with 50-@xmath30 impedance ( for the signal and for the hv ) are laid for about 60  m from the electronics hut to a patch panel at the entrance of the muon pit . from the patch panel to the detectors , co - axial polyimide cables with 50-@xmath30 impedance are laid for about 10  m both for the signal and the hv .",
    "the fadcs and the signal cables were calibrated with a camac charge / time generator ( phillips 7120 ) with a 1% precision .",
    "before installing the detectors in the t2k beamline , the ionization chambers and the silicon pin photodiodes were tested with the electron beam at the institute for chemical research in kyoto university to measure their charge collection times , dependence of the collected charge on the applied voltage and linearity of the collected charge to the beam intensity .",
    "the detectors were also tested in the numi beamline to check the long - term stability of their response ( fnal t968 test experiment ) .",
    "in addition , the radiation tolerance of the photodiode was examined by measuring the collected charge as a function of the electron beam fluence .",
