    "the landau - lifshitz - bloch ( llb ) equation has recently received a lot of attention as a high - temperature extension of the classical micromagnetism . @xcite the use of the llb - based micromagnetism is progressively becoming more popular due to the appearance of novel high - temperature magnetic applications .",
    "the llb formalism has been successfully used to model the heat - assisted magnetic recording , @xcite high - temperature spin - torque dynamics , @xcite spin - caloritronics @xcite and laser - induced magnetization dynamics . @xcite",
    "apart from their fundamental interest , these applications are very appealing from technological perspectives that range from energy saving strategies to the increase of the speed of the magnetization switching .",
    "particularly , in the field of femtosecond optomagnetism , @xcite where a sub - ps demagnetization can be induced by the ultrafast heating produced by a femtosecond laser pulse,@xcite the llb equation has recommended itself as an useful approach .",
    "this is because it correctly describes the longitudinal magnetization relaxation in the strong internal exchange field , the key property of the magnetization dynamics at the timescale below 1 ps .",
    "@xcite although the same characteristics have been proven to be reproduced by atomistic many - body approach , @xcite the use of the llb micromagnetism for modeling purposes has some advantages : ( i ) the possibility to perform large scale modeling , for example , thermally - induced domain wall motion in much larger nanostructures @xcite and ( ii ) analytical derivation of , for instance , the domain wall mobility @xcite or the demagnetization time scales .",
    "@xcite    up to now , most of works used the classical version of the llb equation which was derived starting from a heisenberg spin model and the landau - lifshitz equation for classical atomic spins .",
    "@xcite this has made the classical llb approach very popular since a direct comparison between the llb and the atomistic simulations is therefore possible .",
    "@xcite however , the classical atomistic simulations mean effectively localized magnetic moments and correspond to the infinite spin number @xmath0 . as a consequence , the magnetization versus temperature curve follows a langevin function rather than the brillouin function which has been shown to fit better for ferromagnetic metals,@xcite such as ni and co with @xmath1 , fe with @xmath2 and gd with @xmath3 . in principle , the classical approximation seems hard to justify in the magnetic materials commonly used for ultrafast magnetization dynamics measurements , such as ferromagnetic metals , because of the delocalized nature of the relevant electrons responsible for the magnetic properties .",
    "however , recent works which compare laser - induced magnetization dynamics experiments in metals with atomistic spin models@xcite as well as with their macroscopic counterpart - the classical llb model@xcite- have proven that both models are very successful in the description and understanding of this phenomenon .",
    "similarly , the macroscopic three temperature model ( m3tm ) , @xcite has also been successfully used in the description of _ femtomagnetism _ experiments .",
    "the m3tm assumes a collection of two level spin systems and uses a simple self - consistent weiss mean - field model to evaluate the macroscopic magnetization . in the resulting system ,",
    "importantly , the energy separation between levels is determined by a dynamical exchange interaction , similar to the llb equation , which can be interpreted as a feedback effect to allow the correct account for the high temperature spin fluctuations .",
    "@xcite this consideration turns out to be a fundamental ingredient for the correct description of the ultrafast demagnetization in ferromagnets which suggests that the correct account for non - equilibrium thermodynamics is probably more important than the correct band structure .",
    "more recently , an alternative model to the m3tm and the llb models , the so - called self - consistent bloch ( scb ) equation@xcite which uses a quantum kinetic approach with the instantaneous local equilibrium approximation within the molecular field approximation ( mfa ) , has been suggested .",
    "both the m3tm and scb models can account for the quantum nature of magnetism whereas the atomistic approach and the classical llb equation can not .",
    "however , the llb model is not limited to the classical equation since there exists also the quantum version of the llb equation . the quantum llb equation",
    "( qllb)@xcite has been derived even earlier than the classical one.@xcite the derivation is based on the density matrix approach for the spin operators , similar to the scb model , and uses a dynamical exchange interaction within the mfa , similar to the m3tm model .",
    "one of the aims of the present paper is to study in more depth and to generalize the derivation of the qllb equation in order to clarify its use for the ultrafast dynamics .",
    "we also aim to show that it contains both scb and m3tm equations for @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , the qllb equation has been barely investigated for numerical purposes .",
    "one of the reasons for that is mentioned above : the classical llb equation allows the comparison with the atomistic simulations and , thus , its conclusions can be always checked .",
    "another reason is the fact that the derivation has been made for the spin - phonon interaction mechanism which historically has been thought as the main contribution to the magnetization damping .",
    "this mechanism is important for ps - ns applications at high temperatures such as spincaloritronics .",
    "recent experiment also explore the possibility to excite magnetization dynamics by acoustic pulses in picosecond range @xcite ( thz excitation ) where the phonon mechanism is the predominant one.@xcite however , for the laser - induced magnetization dynamics where the spin - flips occur mainly due to the electron scattering , its relevance is marginal .",
    "thus , in this work we also derive the qllb equation by considering a simple spin - electron interaction as a source for magnetic relaxation .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly outline the qllb derivation . the derivation of the qllb equation above the curie temperature as well as for the simplest electron-``impurity '' mechanism are presented . comparatively to the original garanin s derivation , @xcite we discuss the approximations and put the qllb equation in the form suitable for the comparison between the classical and the quantum cases .",
    "this allows us to relate the internal damping to microscopic scattering mechanisms .",
    "we also show the equivalence of the qllb equation for @xmath4 with the scb and the m3tm models . in section iii",
    "we discuss the temperature dependence of the of the macroscopic longitudinal relaxation and the transverse damping as well as the internal microscopic coupling to the bath parameter within the two mechanisms . in section",
    "iv we present several numerical examples of the magnetization dynamics with the aim of comparison between the classical and the quantum cases . finally , section v concludes the article and discusses possible extensions .",
    "for completeness and for subsequent development , in this first subsection of the paper we summarize the main aspects and approximations of the derivation of the qllb equation .",
    "@xcite the original derivation was done assuming a magnetic ion interacting weakly with a thermal phonon bath via direct and the second order ( raman ) spin - phonon processes .",
    "the ferromagnetic interactions are taken into account in the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) .",
    "the model hamiltonian is written as : @xmath5 where @xmath6 describes the spin system energy , @xmath7 describes the phonon energy , @xmath8 describes the spin - phonon interaction : @xmath9 in the expressions above @xmath10 is the spin operator , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator which creates ( annihilates ) a phonon with frequency @xmath13 where @xmath14 stands for the wave vector @xmath15 and the phonon polarization , and @xmath16 is the gyromagnetic ratio where @xmath17 is the land g - factor , @xmath18 is the bohr magneton and @xmath19 is the reduced planck constant .",
    "the vector @xmath20 is an effective field in the mfa given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the homogeneous part of the exchange field , @xmath23 is the zero fourier component of the exchange interaction related in the mfa to the curie temperature @xmath24 as @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the atomic magnetic moment , @xmath27 is the reduced magnetization where @xmath28 stands for the expectation value ; and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the external magnetic field and @xmath31 represents the anisotropy field .",
    "note that the original derivation@xcite uses the two - site ( exchange ) anisotropy , since the treatment of the on - site anisotropy with a simple decoupling scheme , used below and suitable for the exchange interactions does not produce a correct temperature dependence for the anisotropy .",
    "@xcite however , the on - site anisotropy can be later phenomenologically included into the consideration .",
    "@xcite additionally , the inhomogeneous exchange field , @xmath32 , may be either taken into account here or lately phenomenologically within the micromagnetic approach . @xcite    the first term in the spin - phonon interaction potential @xmath8 in eq",
    ". takes into account the direct spin - phonon scattering processes which are characterized by the amplitude @xmath33 , and the second term describes the raman processes with amplitudes @xmath34 .",
    "the interaction may be anisotropic via the crystal field , which is taken into account through the parameter @xmath35 .",
    "the spin - phonon scattering amplitudes @xmath33 and @xmath34 can be in principle evaluated on the basis of the _ ab - initio _ electronic structure theory .",
    "note that the interaction between spin and phonons considered in the hamiltonian is one of the simplest possible forms , which has a linear ( in the spin variable ) coupling between spin and phonons .",
    "based on the time reversal symmetry argument , it has been discussed@xcite that a quadratic spin - phonon coupling may be more physically justified .",
    "nevertheless , it has been demonstrated that eq .",
    "is adequate to describe the main qualitative properties of the spin dynamics .",
    "the derivation of the qllb equation @xcite is based on a standard density matrix approach@xcite for a system interacting weakly with a bath .",
    "namely , starting from the schrdinger equation one can obtain a liouville equation for the time evolution of the density operator @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the wave function of the whole system ( spin and phonons ) .",
    "next , the interactions with the bath are assumed to be small so that they can not cause a significant entanglement between both systems , this allows to factorize the density operator @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , it is assumed that the bath is in thermal equilibrium ( quasi - equilibrium ) therefore , the density operator can be factorized by its spin and bath parts as @xmath39 , and after averaging over the bath variable one obtains the following equation of motion for the spin density operator @xmath40@xcite @xmath41\\nonumber\\\\ & - & \\frac{1}{\\hbar^{2}}\\int_{0}^{t}dt'\\textrm{tr}_{b}\\left [ \\hat{v}_{\\textit{s - ph}},\\left[\\hat{v}_{\\textit{s - ph}}(t'-t)_{i } , \\hat{\\rho}_{s}(t'-t)_{i}\\hat{\\rho}^{eq}_{b}\\right]\\right ] , \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq : liouville}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the trace over the bath variable , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 is written in terms of the hubbard operators @xmath46 ( where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are eigenvectors of @xmath49 , corresponding to the eigenstates @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively ) , as @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "notice that in eq .",
    "time has been reversed ( @xmath54 ) due to the definitions of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "next , the following approximations are made : ( i ) the markov or short memory approximation assuming that the interactions of the spins with the phonon bath are faster than the spin interactions themselves , this approximation means that in eq . the `` coarse - grained '' derivative is taken over time intervals @xmath57 which are longer than the correlation time of the bath @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) and , ( ii ) secular approximation , where only the resonant secular terms are retained , which consists in neglecting fast oscillating terms in eq . .",
    "it forces the time interval to be@xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 is an eigenvalue of @xmath6 . for a ferromagnetic material with a strong exchange field @xmath62",
    "we have @xmath63 , therefore , for the curie temperature @xmath64 we obtain @xmath65 .",
    "note that a different argument based on the scaling of the perturbation hamiltonian ( singular - coupling limit ) can be found in ref . .",
    "we should note that the validity of the above approximations for ultrafast magnetization processes may be questionable and should be checked in future on the basis of comparison with experiments .",
    "note that similar studies for electronic coherence life time in molecular aggregates have found that the influence of the secular approximation in fs timescale is rather weak.@xcite at the same time , the elimination of the secular approximation may be necessary for thz excitation of the spin system .",
    "on the other hand , if the markov approximation is removed , it would meant an effective use of the colored noise .",
    "our previous results @xcite indicate that the use of the colored noise with correlation time larger than 10 fs considerably slows down the magnetization longitudinal relaxation time leading to time scales not consistent with those observed in experiments .    as a result of these assumptions ,",
    "one arrives to the equation for the hubbard operators in the heisenberg representation which for the isotropic case ( @xmath66 ) becomes@xcite @xmath67\\hat{x}^{mn}(t)\\nonumber\\\\ & - & l_{m-1}l_{n-1}\\hat{x}^{m-1,n-1}(t)-e^{-y_0}l_{m}l_{n}\\hat{x}^{m+1,n+1}(t ) \\big\\rbrace , \\label{eq : xmn_ph}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 @xmath73 and @xmath74^{-1}$ ] is the bose - einstein distribution .",
