    "<S> ultra - cold atoms in optical lattices provide one of the most promising platforms for analog quantum simulations of complex quantum many - body systems . </S>",
    "<S> large - size systems can now routinely be reached and are already used to probe a large variety of different physical situations , ranging from quantum phase transitions to artificial gauge theories . at the same time , measurement techniques are still limited and full tomography for these systems seems out of reach . motivated by this observation , we present a method to directly detect and quantify to what extent a quantum state deviates from a local gaussian description , based on available noise correlation measurements from in - situ and time - of - flight measurements . </S>",
    "<S> this is an indicator of the significance of strong correlations in ground and thermal states , as gaussian states are precisely the ground and thermal states of non - interacting models . </S>",
    "<S> we connect our findings , augmented by numerical tensor network simulations , to notions of equilibration , disordered systems and the suppression of transport in anderson insulators .      </S>",
    "<S> ultra - cold atoms in optical lattices provide one of the most prominent architectures to probe the physics of interacting many - body systems . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of the hamiltonians emerging in this fashion allow to explore a wide range of physical phenomena in and out of equilibrium @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they are one of the most promising platforms for realising quantum simulations and showing signatures of outperforming classical computers for certain problems @xcite . using state - of - the - art techniques , large scale systems with several thousand atoms </S>",
    "<S> can be controlled @xcite ; in fact , even states with specific initial configurations and atoms aligned on largely arbitrary shapes can be realised @xcite . moreover , by modulating the optical lattice in time or by altering its geometry , a wide range of complex physical settings can be explored , ranging from probing quantum phase transitions @xcite to realising instances of artificial gauge theories @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> while a large degree of control over these platforms has been achieved , at present , it is still true that the measurement capabilities are limited in practice . </S>",
    "<S> this appears particularly relevant in the context of quantum simulations , where the result of the simulation has to be read out from the physical experiment . </S>",
    "<S> it seems clear that full quantum state tomography is infeasible , both for limits in the availability of measurement prescriptions as well as due to the unfavourable scaling of the tomographic effort with the system size . </S>",
    "<S> suitable combinations @xcite of tensor network tomography @xcite and compressed sensing schemes @xcite suggest a way forward towards achieving tomographic knowledge , but at present such ideas have not been realised yet .    in the light of these obstacles </S>",
    "<S> , it seems imperative to focus the attention to developing tools directly that detect relevant properties of the quantum state , rather than trying to capture the full density operator  which gives rise to information that is often not needed . among those , entanglement features come to mind that contain valuable information about a quantum state @xcite , or notions of non - classicality that can be directly detected @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , it is of interest to identify and quantify to what extent the state realised corresponds to a ground or thermal state of an interacting model , and hence to what extent the state deviates from a gaussian state . </S>",
    "<S> as one of the main promises of the field of ultra - cold atoms is to precisely study interacting quantum many - body models deviating from non - interacting theories , this type of information is highly relevant , precisely probing to what extend an observation is compatible with a non - interacting model not exhibiting strong correlations .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a new scheme that can be used to directly estimate the local gaussianity of a state , based solely on second and fourth moments of particle number measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we apply this tool to the specific context of ultra - cold atoms and show that noise correlations in in - situ measurements are already sufficient for its calculation . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , we build upon and relate to the ideas of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , but deliver an answer to the converse task : we do not show how interacting models are reflected in noise - correlations , but ask how data can be used to unambiguously witness such deviations from non - interacting models .      interacting many - body quantum systems </S>",
    "<S> are exceedingly hard to capture and describe in terms of classical parameters . </S>",
    "<S> non - interacting models  </S>",
    "<S> models that have gaussian ground and thermal states  are an exception to this rule , in that their description complexity is low . </S>",
    "<S> they are a paradigmatic class of states both for fundamental questions in quantum information as well as for finding ground states of condensed matter models , such as the interaction - free bose - hubbard model @xcite . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> , they are states that do not exhibit the intricate structure of interacting quantum many - body models . again , since one of the main promises of the field is to address such interaction effects , it seems important to have tools at hand to directly detect a deviation from gaussianity .    </S>",
    "<S> the bosonic gaussian states discussed here are characterised by the second moments collected in the correlation matrix @xmath0 with entries @xmath1 where @xmath2 denote the canonical bosonic creation and annihilation operators , @xmath3 , for an @xmath4 mode system . throughout this work </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate massive bosons leading to a situation in which all @xmath5 for all @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> any such correlation matrix satisfying @xmath7 can be diagonalised with a unitary @xmath8 as @xmath9 , reflecting a mode transformation @xmath10 preserving the bosonic commutation relations , where @xmath11 are the transformed modes . </S>",
    "<S> one immediately finds @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the von - neumann entropy and @xmath14 denotes the set of density matrices . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , by invoking the pinching inequality @xcite , one finds that it is already sufficient to fix the diagonal entries of the correlation matrix @xmath15 for @xmath16 @xmath17 following from this , given the diagonal elements of the correlation matrix in the momentum representation of the modes , the following gaussian state is uncorrelated over the individual modes and given by ( [ gge ] ) @xmath18 where @xmath19 is corresponding to @xmath15 ( see appendix [ app_gaussian ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> these states can be viewed as an instance of a generalised gibbs ensemble @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> importantly for the context at hand , such gaussian states also play a prominent role in the setting of optical lattices , where they can , for example , be used to capture the superfluid ground state .      in recent years , research on cold atoms in optical lattices has progressed significantly , by now allowing for unprecedented control of interacting quantum many - body systems , involving several thousands of atoms . </S>",
    "<S> relying on recent experimental advances , the position of individual atoms can be tracked using single site addressing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> using such techniques , local expectation values of the particle number as well as density - density correlations can be resolved . </S>",
    "<S> these local measurements have already provided important insight into the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of quantum many - body systems @xcite and allowed to access their microscopic properties . </S>",
    "<S> the main result of this work , which we detail subsequently , is to identify tools to detect a deviation from gaussianity  reflecting a non - interacting system  based on particle number measurements , building upon refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . for this </S>",
    "<S> , we begin with a clarifying discussion to what extent states encountered in optical lattices can be gaussian .    </S>",
    "<S> states in optical lattices describe massive particles . for that reason , </S>",
    "<S> the particle number in each experimental run is fixed . </S>",
    "<S> this , however , implies that the full state is not gaussian as we show below . </S>",
    "<S> the best example for this is the perfect superfluid state , corresponding to the ground state of the 1d free hopping hamiltonian @xmath20 using a chemical potential @xmath21 to maintain the expected particle number constant , thermal states of this hamiltonian take the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the inverse temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this ensemble is gaussian , as it is the exponential of a quadratic expression of creation and annihilation operators . </S>",
    "<S> it , however , only fixes the particle number on average . in order to fix the actual particle number , meaning to ensure that the state lives on a fixed particle number sector also all higher moments have to be included in the ensemble </S>",
    "<S> however , already including a fixed variance with a lagrange parameter @xmath24 @xmath25 results in a state that is no longer strictly gaussian .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the superfluid state can be thought of being gaussian in one important sense . </S>",
    "<S> local particle number measurements are indistinguishable from a gaussian state for sufficiently large system sizes is is not that obvious . </S>",
    "<S> thus , many measurements of the state can be captured using a simple gaussian description . in the following , we present a general method that allows us to estimate the local deviation from gaussianity of a state , based solely on measurements of second and fourth moments , which will afterwards be applied to states capturing optical lattices .      in order to determine the local deviation from gaussianity of states in optical lattices , we first describe how the distance of the global state to the manifold of gaussian states can be captured and estimated relying only on second and fourth moments . </S>",
    "<S> we then use this insight to define a local deviation from gaussianity and evaluate it for paradigmatic bosonic models .    to quantify the deviation of a state from gaussianity </S>",
    "<S> , we use the relative entropy as a natural quantity with a precise statistical interpretation also known as kullback - leibler divergence . </S>",
    "<S> the relative entropy between two states @xmath26 and @xmath27 is defined as @xmath28 this quantity provides the asymptotic statistical distinguishability of @xmath26 from @xmath27 in the situation of having available arbitrarily many copies of the state @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> based on the relative entropy , we define the global deviation from gaussianity of a state as @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the set of all gaussian states . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen as a measure of the strong correlations present in the state , as quantifying the statistical deviation from a state that could have been the ground or thermal state of a non - interacting model . </S>",
    "<S> as it turns out , the minimum is always achieved for the gaussian state @xmath27 with the same correlation matrix as @xmath26 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we denote this special gaussian state by @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the global deviation from gaussianity can be lower bounded by relying only on local measurement data , which will be performed in the following .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin by using the additivity of the relative entropy which allows us to describe the problem in the symplectic eigenbasis of @xmath31 and decompose the estimate into a problem involving individual eigen - modes @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the unitary transformation in hilbert space ( metaplectic representation ) reflecting the moment transformation into the eigen - modes of @xmath0 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 denotes the reduction to the @xmath36-th mode . making use of the additivity of the relative entropy for each individual mode , we can use the deviation from gaussianity of @xmath31 and rewrite the estimate in terms of entropies @xcite @xmath37 these single mode entropy estimates are a major simplification compared to the original problem .    </S>",
    "<S> naturally calculating or measuring the entropy of @xmath38 is still not a task that can be performed efficiently or effectively . </S>",
    "<S> rather , we solely rely on measured fourth moments @xmath39 and calculate the smallest possible distance to the manifold of gaussian states compatible with this data . in this way , we are able to compute a minimal deviation from gaussianity , thus showing that the state is , in this precise sense , strongly correlated . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore relax the problem as follows @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the maximum entropy state compatible with the second and fourth moments . using schur s theorem @xcite , which states that the ordered eigenvalues of a matrix majorise the ordered diagonal entries @xmath42 and the fact that the von - neumann entropy is schur convex , the entropy of this state can be upper bounded by only considering the diagonal @xmath43 the second index labelling the main diagonal elements . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for an efficient solution of the optimisation problem using lagrange multipliers ( see appendix [ app_singlemode ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we have seen that the global deviation from gaussianity defined in eq .   can be lower bounded by using second and fourth moments in the symplectic eigenbasis of the state .    </S>",
    "<S> based on this insight , we turn back to states describing massive particles in optical lattices . there </S>",
    "<S> , the full state can not be reconstructed , which necessarily implies that only important features of the state may be addressed . </S>",
    "<S> here we focus on a particularly simple quantity that only relies on measuring the particle number on a single site , which is accessible experimentally using single - site addressing @xcite . using such data </S>",
    "<S> , we define the _ local deviation from gaussianity _ on site @xmath44 of a state as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the particle number operator on site @xmath44 and @xmath47 denote its experimentally measured expectation value and variance .    </S>",
    "<S> this local deviation from gaussianity is not only comparably easily measurable , but more importantly also yields relevant information about the quantum system at hand . as discussed above </S>",
    "<S> , the superfluid state is locally gaussian in the sense that the quantity in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> vanishes for large enough system sizes . in this way , calculating the local deviation from gaussianity , which captures to what extend onsite particle measurements are compatible with a gaussian state , is a natural way to quantify the distance to a perfect superfluid state . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , for the important case of non - interacting particles , it can also be used to identify the suppression of particle propagation due to disorder . </S>",
    "<S> both these applications are elaborated upon below .      in the following , we present numerical results for bosonic models commonly encountered in optical lattices . </S>",
    "<S> we begin with the attractive bose - hubbard model @xmath48 where we have chosen the hopping strength equal to one and denote the interaction strength with @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state for @xmath50 is the idealised superfluid state introduced above and thus locally gaussian in our sense , corresponding to a local deviation from gaussianity of zero . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , when the interaction strength is increased , the system becomes strongly correlated and the size of the local deviation from gaussianity should increase .    </S>",
    "<S> we have confirmed that this behaviour is indeed encountered numerically and find an almost linear relation between the local deviation from gaussianity and the interaction strength ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ground ] ) . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , one could even see the local deviation from gaussianity as an experimental probe to directly measure the interaction strength based solely on ground state particle number fluctuations .     </S>",
    "<S> and interaction strength @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are obtained with exact diagonalisation using periodic boundary conditions on @xmath51 lattice sites . ]    </S>",
    "<S> another setting in which the local deviation from gaussianity is intriguing to investigate is the evolution of free systems , where it can be used as an indicator of disorder and the concomitant suppression of transport .      </S>",
    "<S> it is known that non - interacting systems which exhibit transport in a suitable sense evolve in time in a way that the states tend to locally gaussian states following out of equilibrium dynamics @xcite , a feature that is true in surprising generality @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in this setting , the precise initial conditions are forgotten over time and local expectation values can be captured using only the second moments of the initial state , then fully determining local expectation values .    </S>",
    "<S> this applies in particular to the free hopping hamiltonian introduced in eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> a paradigmatic setting for this is given by an initial product state with one particle on every second site , which can be experimentally prepared employing optical super - lattices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this initial state is the ground state of an infinitely strongly interacting bose - hubbard model and it is thus far from being locally gaussian , as described above . during time evolution that has transport , however , </S>",
    "<S> the particles distribute evenly over the lattice , thus moving towards the manifold of locally gaussian states .    for disordered systems </S>",
    "<S> , transport is strongly suppressed and the distribution of particles over the lattice thus does not take place . for concreteness , </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a simple 1d hopping model @xmath52 with local potentials @xmath53 drawn uniformly from some interval @xmath54 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath55 the model reduces to the free hopping and local gaussification thus takes place . in contrast , when randomness is present , transport breaks down , resulting in a positive local deviation from gaussianity even for long times ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : time ] ) .     sites . </S>",
    "<S> the initial state is a charge - density wave corresponding to a fock state with one atom on every second lattice site and the evolution is governed by the hamiltonian in eq .   with @xmath53 drawn randomly from the interval @xmath54 $ ] for three different values of the disorder strength . </S>",
    "<S> shown is the average over @xmath56 disorder realisations . </S>",
    "<S> initially , the local state is very non - gaussian . for the translationally invariant system showing transport , </S>",
    "<S> information spreads through the lattice and the local measurements become compatible with a fully gaussian description of the state , that is , the system dynamically gaussifies . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in the disordered case , transport is strongly suppressed and the non - gaussianity remains locally visible . ]      the same approach discussed here for local deviation from gaussianity can be applied to global properties of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it can be applied to any modes that are defined by a mode transformation @xmath57 in particular , it is applicable to time - of - flight measurements . if the quantum state is not translationally invariant due to the presence of a harmonic trap , an average deviation from gaussianity over the system size is then directly detected in this way . in time - of - flight measurements with finite accuracy of the camera pixels , </S>",
    "<S> effectively the diagonal elements @xmath58 of @xmath59 are measured , more commonly expressed as @xmath60 as a function of @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the time of flight and @xmath63 is a constant derived from the mass and the lattice constant of the optical lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the fourth moments of the same modes defined by @xmath64 are accessible as @xmath65 and contained in the very same images from the laboratory , merely by computing higher moments , following a prescription of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> let it be stressed again that in contrast to this reference , we aim for and provide a direct detection of correlations based solely on second and fourth moments .      in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we have introduced and elaborated on a method of directly detecting local deviation from gaussianity of quantum many - body systems . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , we have identified a way of witnessing the deviation from the ground or thermal state of a non - interacting model , hence directly observing strong correlations present in the state . </S>",
    "<S> we did so by making use of ideas of convex optimisation . </S>",
    "<S> more conceptually speaking , the mindset that we advocated here is to make use of currently available tools to directly detect properties relevant for a research question at hand . given the simplicity of the bounds , it constitutes a relevant further step to equip the bounds and estimates presented here with precise statistical confidence regions . </S>",
    "<S> this complements a more conventional approach in which a situation sharing some feature is modelled or classically simulated , and the predictions compared with those of data from measurements . </S>",
    "<S> it is the hope that the present work can contribute to the further development of such tools of certification for the study of many - body models , particularly relevant for the partial certification of the functioning and read out of analog quantum simulators .    </S>",
