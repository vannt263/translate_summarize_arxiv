    "in the standard model the masses of elementary particles arise from the higgs field acting on the originally massless particles .",
    "when applied to the visible matter of the universe this explanation remains unsatisfactory as long as we consider the vacuum as an empty space .",
    "the qcd vacuum contains a condensate of up and down quarks .",
    "condensate means that the @xmath12 pairs are correlated via inter - quark forces mediated by gluon exchanges . as part of the vacuum structure",
    "the @xmath12 pairs have to be in a scalar - isosclar configuration .",
    "this suggests that the vacuum condensate may be described in terms of a scalar - isoscalar particle , @xmath13 , providing the @xmath7 field .",
    "these two descriptions in terms of a vacuum condensate or a @xmath7 field are essentially equivalent and are the bases of the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite and the linear @xmath14 model ( l@xmath7 m ) , @xcite respectively .",
    "furthermore , it is possible write down a bosonized version of the njl model where the vacuum condensate is replaced by the vacuum expectation value of the @xmath7 field .    in the qcd vacuum the largest part of the mass @xmath15 of an originally massless quark , up ( u ) or down ( d ) ,",
    "is generated independent of the presence of the higgs field and amounts to @xmath16 mev @xcite .",
    "the higgs field only adds a small additional part to the total constituent - quark mass leading to @xmath17 mev and @xmath18 mev for the up and down quark , respectively @xcite .",
    "these constituent quarks are the building blocks of the nucleon in a similar way as the nucleons are in case of nuclei .",
    "quantitatively , we obtain the experimental masses of the nucleons after including a binding energy of 19.6 mev and 20.5 mev per constituent quark for the proton and neutron , respectively , again in analogy to the nuclear case where the binding energies are 2.83 mev per nucleon for @xmath19h and 2.57 mev per nucleon for @xmath20he .    in the present work",
    "we extend our previous @xcite investigation by exploring in more detail the rules according to which the effects of electroweak ( ew ) and strong - interaction symmetry breaking combine in order to generate the masses of hadrons . as a test of the concept ,",
    "the mass of the @xmath1 meson is precisely predicted on an absolute scale . in the strange - quark sector",
    "the higgs boson is responsible for about 1/3 of the constituent - quark mass , so that effects of the interplay of the two components of mass generation become essential .",
    "progress is made by taking into account the predicted second @xmath7 meson , @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "it is found that the coupling constant of the @xmath22-quark coupling to the @xmath23 meson is larger than the corresponding quantity of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 quarks coupling to the @xmath7 meson by a factor of @xmath26 .",
    "this leads to a considerable increase of the constituent - quark masses in the strange - quark sector in comparison with the ones in the non - strange sector already in the chiral limit , i.e. without the effects of the higgs boson .",
    "there is an additional sizable increase of the mass generation mediated by the higgs boson due to a @xmath27 20 times stronger coupling of the @xmath22 quark to the higgs boson in comparison to the @xmath24 and @xmath25 quarks .",
    "in addition to the progress made in @xcite as described above that paper contains a history of the subject from schwinger s seminal work of 1957 @xcite to the discovery of the brout - englert - higgs ( beh ) mechnism , with emphasis on the nobel prize awarded to nambu in 2008 .",
    "this is the reason why paper @xcite has been published as a supplement of the nobel lectures of englert @xcite and higgs @xcite .",
    "in figure [ sombr6 ] the symmetry breaking process is illustrated .",
    "the left panel corresponds to the l@xmath7 m , the right panel to the bosonized njl model , together with their ew counterparts . in the left panel symmetry breaking provides us with a vacuum expectation @xmath28 of the higgs field h and @xmath29 of the @xmath7-field . without the effects of the higgs field the strong - interaction nambu - goldstone bosons , @xmath1 , are massless .",
    "the @xmath1 mesons generate mass via the interaction with the higgs field in the presence of the qcd quark condensate , as will be outlined below .",
    "the ew counterparts of the @xmath1 mesons are the longitudinal components @xmath30 of the weak vector bosons @xmath31 .",
    "these longitudinal components are transferred into the originally massless weak vector bosons w via the brout - englert - higgs ( beh ) mechanism .",
    "m together with the ew counterpart .",
    "right panel : the bosonized njl model together with the ew counterpart . ]    in the right panel the view of the bosonized njl model is presented .",
    "the originally massless quarks interact via the exchanges of a @xmath7 meson or a higgs boson with the respective @xmath7 field of the qcd vacuum or the higgs field of the ew vacuum . as long as we consider the two symmetry breaking processes",
    "separately we can write down @xcite @xmath32 the quantity g is the quark-@xmath7 coupling constant which has been derived to be @xmath33 .",
    "this quantity leads via eq .",
    "( [ sym1 ] ) to the constituent - quark mass @xmath16 mev in the chiral limit ( cl ) , i.e. without the effects of the higgs boson .",
    "the quantity @xmath34 mev is the pion decay constant in the chiral limit , serving as vacuum expectation value @xmath35 .",
    "the quantity @xmath36 gev is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field , leading to the current - quark masses @xmath37 mev and @xmath38 mev .",

    "( [ sym2 ] ) and ( [ sym3 ] ) are chosen such that these values are reproduced .    in the following we study the laws according to which",
    "the two sources of mass generation combine in order to generate the observable particle masses . for this purpose",
    "we write down the well known njl equation and refer to @xcite for more details @xmath39 . \\label{njl}\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "( [ njl ] ) the interaction between fermions is parameterized by the four - fermion interaction constant g. explicit symmetry breaking as mediated by the higgs boson is represented by the trace of the current - quark mass matrix @xmath40 @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ njl ] ) the constituent - quark mass in the chiral limit ( cl ) may be derived via the relation @xmath41 the bosonization of eq .",
    "( [ njl ] ) is obtained by replacing g by a propagator @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the mass of the @xmath7 meson in the chiral limit and @xmath44 the momentum carried by the @xmath7 meson , and by introducing the @xmath7 and @xmath1 fields via @xmath45 using the nambu relation @xmath46 the quark-@xmath7 coupling constant @xmath33 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 we arrive at @xmath49 in the present case of small current - quark masses it is straightforward to arrive at a version which includes the effects of the higgs boson by replacing @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "the result is given by @xmath52 this equation shows that a representation of the qcd quark condensate through the vacuum expectation value of the @xmath7 field is possible and leads to a prediction for a value of the vacuum condensate which is tested and found valid in the next subsection .",
    "1 suggests a formal similarity of strong - interaction and ew interaction symmetry breaking .",
    "this formal similarity is incomplete because at the present state of our knowledge we have to consider the higgs boson as elementary , i.e. without a fermion - antifermion substructure .",
    "formerly , substructures of the higgs field in terms of techniquark - antitechniquark pairs or top - antitop quark pairs have been discussed . in the techniquark - model strong self - coupling",
    "has been discussed leading to a predicted higgs - boson mass of @xmath53 tev . in the top - quark model",
    "the predicted higgs boson mass is expected to be @xmath54 . with a comparatively small experimental mass of @xmath55 gev of the higgs boson",
    "these models seem to be excluded . in case of the left panel",
    "we may write down a potential in the form @xcite @xmath56 the potential @xmath57 then has its minimum at a finite value of @xmath58 where @xmath59 we can choose , say , @xmath60 where @xmath36 gev is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field . in the case of strong interaction the corresponding relations",
    "are @xmath61 with @xmath62    it is of interest to compare the selfcoupling strengths of strong interaction symmetry breaking with the one of ew symmetry breaking .",
    "the sigma - meson mass in the chiral limit may be expressed in two ways @xcite @xmath63 where the first version corresponds to the njl model and the second to the l@xmath7 m . with @xmath64 and @xmath65",
    "this leads to @xmath66 for the higgs boson we have @xmath67 leading to @xmath68 we see that the strong - interaction selfcoupling is a factor @xmath69 larger than the ew selfcoupling . but except for this , there indeed is a formal similarity between the two versions of symmetry breaking .",
    "this may help to get a better understanding of the underlying physics of the higgs boson .",
    "the mass of the @xmath1 meson is given by the gell - mann  oakes  renner ( gor ) relation in the form @xmath70 ( see eq .",
    "( [ condensate ] ) leading to @xmath71 the numerical value derived from eq .",
    "( [ gor2 ] ) is @xmath72 mev , to be compared with the experimental values @xmath73 mev and @xmath74 mev .",
    "apparently , the predicted value of the @xmath1 meson mass is quite satisfactory when use is made of the current - quark masses following from eqs .",
    "( [ sym2 ] ) and ( [ sym3 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in the neutral @xmath75 we find a coulomb attraction between the quark and the antiquark leading to an experimental value smaller than the predicted value , whereas in the charged @xmath76 we find a coulomb repulsion between the quark and the antiquark leading to an experimental value larger than the predicted value .    from eqs .",
    "( [ sym1 ] )  ( [ sym3 ] ) we can see that the constituent quark in the chiral limit and the current quarks generate masses independently . but these masses are not the ones observed in low - energy qcd . the procedure to arrive at predictions for the observable masses has been derived from arguments given by the l@xmath7 m as well as njl models .",
    "first we calculate the mass of the @xmath7 meson in the chiral limit via the nambu relation @xmath77 and then use the relation @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( [ sigma - mass ] ) the effects of the higgs boson enter via the average pion mass @xmath79 .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the limit of small current - quark masses the result of eq .",
    "( [ sigma - mass ] ) can also be derived by simply adding the contributions from the qcd quark - condensate and from the higgs boson , leading to @xmath80 the arguments leading to an equivalence of eqs .",
    "( [ sigma - mass ] ) and ( [ sigmass ] ) are as follows .",
    "( [ sigma - mass ] ) can be written is the form @xmath81 here use has been made of eqs .",
    "( [ gor2 ] ) and ( [ nambueq ] ) to show that the term @xmath82 of eq .",
    "( [ sigmass1 ] ) is equal to @xmath83 if higher order terms amounting to 4% and the deviation of @xmath84 from 1 amounting to 3% are neglected .",
    "the result shown in eq .",
    "( [ sigmass ] ) is in line with the expectation that the @xmath7 meson is a loosely bound object where no additional term , _ viz . _",
    "the binding energy @xmath85 , has to be taken in account .",
    "this is different in the case of baryons as we will see later .",
    "in the previous paper @xcite it has been shown that it is possible to make precise predictions on an absolute scale not only for the mass of the nucleon but also for such sophisticated structure constants as there are the magnetic moment and the polarizability .",
    "this is an important finding because it implies that the underlying models are confirmed in different and complementary ways . in the present article we return to this problem and",
    "make some necessary amendments .",
    "the magnetic moments of the nucleon are given by @xmath86 in units of the nuclear magneton @xmath87 .",
    "constituent - quark masses enter through the relations @xmath88 where @xmath89 mev and @xmath18 mev .",
    "this leads to the magnetic moments of the constituent quarks @xmath90 and to predicted magnetic moments of the nucleon @xmath91 comparing these values with the experimental magnetic moments of the nucleon @xmath92 we arrive at very small differences @xmath93 @xmath94 apparently , the necessary corrections to the quark - model predictions of the magnetic moments for the proton and neutron are the same .",
    "this may help to find an explanation for these corrections .",
    "the most probable explanation may be found in terms of meson exchange currents though available calculations lead to too large values .    in the present work",
    "we are mainly interested in the small sizes of @xmath95 of the differences showing that the predictions obtained on the basis of the njl model are very precise .      a nucleon in an electric field * e * and magnetic field * h * obtains an electric dipole moment * d * and magnetic dipole moment *",
    "m * given by @xmath96 in a unit system where the electric charge @xmath97 is given by @xmath98 .",
    "the quantities @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the electric and magnetic polarizabilities belonging to the fundamental structure constants of the nucleon .",
    "it is of importance that these quantities are composed of two components @xmath101 where the superscript @xmath22 denotes the @xmath22-channel contribution and the superscript @xmath102 the @xmath102-channel contribution .",
    "the @xmath22-channel contribution is related to the meson - photoproduction amplitudes of the nucleon via the optical theorem whereas the @xmath102-channel contribution is related to the @xmath7 meson as part of the constituent - quark structure .",
    "therefore , it is possible to use the polarizabilities as a tool to test the predicted mass and structure of the @xmath7 meson .",
    "this is summarized in the following equations @xcite @xmath103 , \\label{sigpol1 }     \\\\ & & ( \\alpha-\\beta)^t_{p , n}=\\frac{g_{\\sigma nn}{\\cal m}(\\sigma\\to\\gamma\\gamma ) } { 2\\pi\\,m^2_\\sigma}=15.2\\,\\ , , \\quad ( \\alpha+\\beta)^t_{p , n}=0 \\label{sigpol2}\\\\ & & \\alpha^t_{p , n}=+7.6\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad \\beta^t_{p , n}-7.6\\label{sigpol3}\\\\ & & \\alpha^s_p=+4.5,\\quad \\alpha^s_n=+5.1,\\quad \\beta^s_p=+9.4,\\quad \\beta^s_n=10.1 \\label{sigpol4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in units of @xmath104 , where use is made of @xmath105 and @xmath106 mev as predicted by the njl model .",

    "the value predicted for the @xmath110 hyperon is in perfect agreement with experimental value . in other cases",
    "the agreement is less pronounced .",
    "however , by using a different choice for the constituent mass of the strange quark no improvement of the general agreement is obtained .",
    "the conclusion we have to draw is that our set of constituent - quark masses is in line with the experimental magnetic moments , though there is no strong support for the specific value adopted for the @xmath22 quark .",
    "the information obtained from the masses of scalar mesons on the constituent mass of the @xmath22 quark appears to be more reliable than the one obtained from magnetic moments .",
