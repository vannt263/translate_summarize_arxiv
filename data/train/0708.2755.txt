    "these days , supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most important topics for both theoretical and experimental high energy physics .",
    "the phenomenology of susy has been investigated quite exhaustively recent years with respect to the future high energy experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) or at the international linear collider ( ilc ) . from a phenomenological point of view",
    ", susy must be broken in order to be realized in nature [ 1 ] .",
    "the breaking of susy may be accomplished by several methods , one of which is by introducing soft susy breaking terms .",
    "the exact form of the soft susy breaking terms are not precisely determined .",
    "they may differ from one model to another .",
    "in particular , the coefficients of these susy breaking terms and their associated terms may either be real or complex",
    ". the complex phases that may arise from these soft susy breaking terms in a supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( sm ) can be the source of cp violation , through the mixing between the cp even and the cp odd states , since there are at least two higgs doublets in the model in order to give masses to the up - quark sector and the down - quark sector separately [ 2 ] .    it is already known that , at the tree level , neither explicit nor spontaneous cp violation is possible in the higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , which has just two higgs doublets , because any complex phases in its higgs sector can always be eliminated by rotating the higgs fields . even at the one - loop level",
    ", spontaneous cp violation is disfavored because it requires a very light neutral higgs boson , which has already been ruled out by experiments . on the other hand ,",
    "explicit cp violation is viable in the mssm at the one - loop level since the radiative corrections due to the loops of relevant particles , such as quarks and squarks , yield the mixing between the cp even and the cp odd neutral higgs bosons [ 3 - 10 ] .",
    "the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) , with an additional higgs singlet besides two higgs doublets in its higgs sector , may not accommodate spontaneous cp violation at the tree level because of vacuum stability [ 11 ] .",
    "however , the scenario of explicit cp violation is possible for the nmssm at the tree level . by assuming the degeneracy of the stop quark masses in the higgs sector of the nmssm , large explicit cp violation",
    "may be realized as the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the neutral higgs singlet approaches to the electroweak scale [ 12 ] .",
    "the tree - level higgs potential of the nmssm may have only one physical cp violating phase , either by redefining the phases of the three higgs fields or by applying two cp - odd tadpole minimum conditions in the explicit cp violation scenario .    in previous articles",
    ", we have analyzed the phenomenology of the explicit cp violation in the higgs sector of the nmssm at the 1-loop level , where the radiative corrections due to quarks and squarks of the third generation are taken into account [ 13 ] .",
    "there can be several complex phases which allow the explicit cp violation in the higgs sector of the nmssm at the one - loop level : two complex phases may arise from the stop and sbottom quark masses that are associated with quadratic coupling @xmath4 and the trilinear susy breaking parameters , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "additional complex phases from the chargino and neutralino sectors may also contribute to the cp mixing among the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons .",
    "the presence of explicit cp violation may affect the higgs phenomenology such as the masses of the neutral higgs bosons , their productions and decays .",
    "in high - energy @xmath7 collisions , the dominant production channels for neutral higgs bosons are the higgs - strahlung process , the @xmath2 fusion process , and the @xmath3 fusion process . within the context of explicit cp violation ,",
    "the prospects of discovering the neutral higgs bosons in high - energy @xmath7 collisions have been studied in a general two - higgs doublet model [ 14 ] and in the mssm [ 15,16 ] . in particular , in the mssm with explicit cp violation , where the cp mixing among the cp even and cp odd states is maximized ,",
    "the production cross sections for the neutral higgs bosons in @xmath0 collisions at @xmath8 = 500 and 800 gev are calculated [ 16 ] .",
    "meanwhile , the decays of the higgs bosons in the mssm with explicit cp violation have also been studied in the literature [ 5,10 ] .    in this article , we study the higgs sector of the nmssm at the one - loop level in the explicit cp violation scenario , where the quarks and squarks of the third generation are taken into account .",
    "the two cp - odd tadpole minimum conditions are obtained at the one - loop level .",
    "there appear three physical phases as the possible sources of explicit cp violation in the nmssm .",
    "we establish and explore a reasonable region in the parameter space of the present model , including the cp phases , in order to examine how the upper bound on the masses of the neutral higgs bosons are dependent on the parameters .",
    "further , the production cross sections , and decay rates as well , of the neutral higgs bosons are calculated for the future @xmath7 ilc with @xmath1 gev , within the established parameter region , via the higgs - strahlung process , the @xmath2 fusion process , and the @xmath3 fusion process .",
    "we study the effects of the cp phases upon the production cross sections of these neutral higgs bosons and their decay rates .",
    "we also obtain the lower bound on the production cross sections of these neutral higgs bosons within the established parameter region , which allow us to expect that the neutral sector of the nmssm with explicit cp violation may be tested at the future ilc with @xmath1 gev .",
    "the higgs sector of the nmssm consists of two higgs doublet fields @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and a neutral higgs singlet field @xmath11 [ 17,18 ] .",
    "their hypercharges are -1/2 , 1/2 , and 0 , respectively . for the fermion matter fields in this model ,",
    "only the quarks of the third generation are taken into account .",
    "then , the superpotential of the model may be expressed as @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the yukawa coupling coefficients , @xmath14 is the chiral superfield containing the left - handed @xmath15 quarks , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) are the charge conjugates of the right - handed @xmath15 quarks , and @xmath18 is an antisymmetric @xmath19 matrix with @xmath20 .",
    "note that all coupling coefficients are dimensionless .",
    "as is well known , the parameter @xmath4 is introduced into the nmssm to avoid the so - called @xmath21-problem in the mssm , since @xmath22 corresponds to the @xmath21 parameter in the superpotetial of the mssm , where @xmath23 is the vev of @xmath11 .",
    "the global u(1 ) peccei - quinn symmetry is explicitly broken by the presence of the cubic term proportional to @xmath24 in the superpotential . without the @xmath24-term ,",
    "a massless pseudoscalar higgs boson would appear beacuse the peccei - quinn symmetry is recovered at the tree level .",
    "thus , the two dimensionless parameters @xmath4 and @xmath24 are essential in the nmssm",
    ".    the higgs potential at the tree level may decompose into three parts as [ 18 ] @xmath25 where @xmath26 + |k|^2|n|^4 -(\\lambda k^*h_1^t \\epsilon h_2 n^{*2}+ { \\rm h.c . } ) \\ , \\cr v_{\\rm s } & = & m_{h_1}^2|h_1|^2 + m_{h_2}^2|h_2|^2 + m_n^2|n|^2 - ( \\lambda a_{\\lambda } h_1^t",

    "the soft susy breaking @xmath30 has three soft masses @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , and two additional parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 , both of mass dimension",
    ".    in general , @xmath4 , @xmath24 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 in @xmath36 can be complex . among them , @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be adjusted to be real and positive by redefining the phases of @xmath39 and @xmath11 .",
    "thus , at the tree level , @xmath40 and @xmath41 can in general be complex .",
    "consequently , the tree - level higgs potential may have at most only one physical phase , which may be chosen to be @xmath42 in @xmath43 .    the radiative corrections at the one - loop level to the above tree - level higgs potential , obtained by employing the effective potential method , is given as [ 19 ] @xmath44   \\ , \\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath45 stands for the quarks and squarks of the third generation , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are respectively the degrees of freedom for quarks and squarks , and @xmath48 is the renormalization scale in the modified minimal subtraction scheme .",
    "in the above expression , note that quarks enter with a negative sign while squarks enter with a positive sign , and @xmath49 depends on the neutral higgs fields , where the tree - level masses of the relevant quark and squarks should be used as input .",
    "the radiatively corrected higgs potential at the one - loop level is given by @xmath50 .",
    "after the electroweak symmetry breaking , neutral higgs fields @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath11 may acquire complex vevs @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , respectively , where @xmath53 is adjusted to be real .",
    "the tree - level masses of the quarks of the third generation are given as @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 gev .",
    "the masses of the squarks of the third generation are @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the soft susy breaking mass , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the trilinear susy breaking parameters of the mass dimension",
    ". two cp phases @xmath62 and @xmath63 are given by @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 come from the complex phases of @xmath4 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "note that the masses of squarks of the third generation are different from the masses of the quarks of the third generation , due to the susy breaking terms , which account in general for the mass splitting between an ordinary particle and its superpartner depending on the susy breaking scale ( 1 - 2 tev ) .    for simplicity , we reexpress the higgs multiplets via a unitary transformation as @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the scalar higgs fields , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the pseudoscalar higgs fields , and @xmath75 is the charged higgs field .",
    "note that the phases are explicitly shown in the expression .",
    "as we allow cp violation in the higgs sector of the nmssm at the one - loop level , there are several complex phases : @xmath76 , @xmath66 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",

    "in addition to these phases , we have two more complex phases , namely , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",

    "note that @xmath89 here at the one - loop level is different from the phase @xmath89 previously defined at the tree level . after imposing these two cp - odd tadpole minimum conditions ,",
    "we are left with only three phases @xmath89 and @xmath62 and @xmath63 in the radiatively corrected higgs potential @xmath90 at the one - loop level .",
    "these three phases are the physically free parameters .    for the masses of the five neutral higgs fields , we differentiate @xmath90 with respect to the neutral higgs fields , in order to obtain the symmetric @xmath91 mass matrix @xmath92 for the neutral higgs bosons .",
    "the matrix elements are calculated in the ( @xmath93)-basis as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is introduced for convenience as @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the matrix elements due to the contributions of the third generations .",

    "the matrix elements that are responsible for the scalar - pseudoscalar mixing are @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 . the physical neutral higgs bosons and their squared masses",
    "are given respectively by the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues , denoted as @xmath111 ( @xmath112 = 1 - 5 ) , of the mass matrix .",
    "we sort these five neutral higgs bosons in the increasing order of their masses such that , for example , @xmath113 is the smallest eigenvalue and @xmath114 is the lightest neutral higgs boson .    finally , the charged higgs boson mass at the tree level is obtained as @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the @xmath117 boson mass .",
    "note that , unlike the case of the mssm , the tree - level mass of the charged higgs boson may be either heavier or lighter than @xmath117 boson , according to whether the second term is smaller than the third term .",
    "also note that the charged higgs boson mass contains @xmath118 , even though there might be no cp mixing in the charged higgs sector .",
    "for numerical analyses , we take @xmath119 for weak - mixing angle , @xmath120 for the fermi coupling constant , @xmath121 gev for the total decay width of @xmath122 boson , @xmath123 gev for the mass of @xmath122 boson , @xmath124 gev for the mass of @xmath117 boson , @xmath125 gev for the mass of top quark , and @xmath126 gev for the mass of bottom quark . in the nmssm with explicit cp violation , we have as many as thirteen free parameters : @xmath48 , @xmath89 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath61 , @xmath127 , @xmath4 , @xmath24 , @xmath35 , @xmath23 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath34 . among them",

    "however , we will use @xmath131 in eq .",
    "9 instead of @xmath34 , since it is the lighter pseudoscalar higgs boson mass in cp - conserving limit .",
    "we explore a reasonable region of the parameter space of the model , whose boundaries are set as @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 gev , and @xmath136 gev , using a random - number generating function .",
    "the number of points we explore in this region of the parameter space is @xmath137 . among those @xmath137 points randomly distributed in the parameter space ,",
    "only 14571 points are physically allowed . at these 14571 points of the parameter space",
    ", we consider the neutral higgs productions at the ilc , the future high - energy @xmath7 colliding machine , with the proposed center of mass energy of 500 gev .",
    "the mass of the lightest neutral higgs boson , @xmath138 , is calculated at each of the physically allowed points we explore in the prescribed region , and the masses of heavier neutral higgs bosons as well .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "1 , where @xmath138 is plotted against @xmath127 . one can find that the upper bound on the lightest neutral higgs boson mass increases as @xmath127 increases , and it is nearly saturated at about 150 gev as @xmath127 approaches to 30 .",
    "the behavior of the upper bound on the lightest neutral higgs boson mass in the nmssm with explicit cp violation is somewhat similar to that of the mssm with no cp violation .",
    "it may be contrasted against the case of no cp violation in the higgs sector of the nmssm , where the upper bound on the lightest neutral higgs boson mass becomes maximal at around @xmath139 and decreases slightly as @xmath140 further increases , for a wide region in the parameter space , mainly because of the higgs singlet effects .",
    "the most important channels for the production of neutral higgs bosons in high energy @xmath7 collisions are : the higgs - strahlung process @xmath141 , the @xmath2 fusion process @xmath142 , and the @xmath3 fusion process @xmath143 ( @xmath112 = 1 - 5 ) .",
    "we denote the production cross sections for each of these processes as @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 , respectively .",
    "these production cross sections in each channel are related to the production cross section for the sm higgs boson in the corresponding channel as [ 20 ] @xmath147 where @xmath148 ( @xmath112 = 1 - 5 ) are defined as @xmath149 with @xmath150 being the elements of the orthogonal matrix that diagonalizes the @xmath151 mass matrix of the neutral higgs bosons .",

    "let us first consider the higgs - strahlung process for the neutral higgs productions .",
    "at each physically allowed point , we calculate the mass of the participating neutral higgs boson , and its production cross section via the higgs - strahlung process .",
    "we repeat this job for all five neutral higgs bosons , to obtain @xmath144 ( @xmath112 = 1 - 5 ) at each of 14571 points .",
    "now , we denote by @xmath154 the largest production cross section among them , namely , @xmath155 \\ .\\ ] ] thus , at every physically allowed point of the parameter space of the nmssm , @xmath154 is obtained .",
    "the meaning of @xmath154 is that , at a given point of the parameter space , at least one of the five neutral higgs bosons in the nmssm may be produced via the higgs - strahlung process with that cross section .    in fig 2a , we plot @xmath154 against @xmath138 for the future high energy @xmath7 collider with @xmath156 gev .",
    "the dashed curve in the figure represents the production cross section of the sm higgs boson via the higgs - strahlung process [ 20,21 ] . among @xmath154 , we may select the smallest one and denote it as @xmath157 .",
    "the significance of @xmath157 is quite clear ; at least one of the five neutral higgs bosons in the nmssm may be produced via the higgs - strahlung process with a cross section larger than @xmath157 , regardless of the parameter values . in this sense",
    ", it may be regarded as the absolute minimum of the production cross section of a neutral higgs boson in the nmssm via the higgs - strahlung process , with explicit cp violation at the one - loop level . from fig .",
    "2a , one can see that @xmath158 fb .    next , we consider the neutral higgs productions via the @xmath2 fusion process and the @xmath3 fusion process . for the @xmath2 fusion process , we determine @xmath159 and @xmath160 , which are respectively analogous to @xmath154 and @xmath157 for the higgs - strahlung process .",
    "we show the result for @xmath159 in fig .",
    "2b , plotted against @xmath138 , and we obtain @xmath161 fb . also , for the @xmath3 fusion process , we determine @xmath162 and @xmath163 , which are respectively analogous to @xmath154 and @xmath157 for the higgs - strahlung process .",

    "plotted against @xmath138 , and we obtain @xmath164 fb . the dashed curves in figs .",
    "2b and 2c represent respectively the production cross sections of the sm higgs boson via the @xmath2 fusion and the @xmath3 fusion processes .",
    "we find that , interestingly , all of @xmath158 fb , @xmath161 fb , and @xmath164 fb occur at an identical point of the parameter spce , where the values of the parameters are @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 gev , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 gev , @xmath171 gev , @xmath172 gev , and @xmath173 gev .",

    "in fact , the patterns of fluctuation in the neutral higgs productions is very similar to the fluctuation patterns in @xmath148 .",

    "the decay widths of the five neutral higgs bosons into @xmath227 are also important , except @xmath223 , in the present model , at least for larger @xmath140 .",
    "note that we set @xmath166 in our numerical calculations .",
    "one may also observe that for the most part of the @xmath89 range the branching ratio of @xmath193 into @xmath228 is larger than that of into @xmath229 , for all five neutral higgs bosons except @xmath223 .",
    "we have a large branching ratio of @xmath193 into @xmath228 , mainly because we set @xmath230 , since the decay width of a neutral higgs boson into a pair of down - type quarks , as well as that into a pair of charged leptons , increases as @xmath127 increases .",
    "this observation is interesting as compared to the case of the sm , where the branching ratio of the sm higgs boson into @xmath231 is larger than that into @xmath228 because the coupling strength of the sm higgs boson with a fermion is proportional to the mass of the fermion .",
    "we have studied the higgs sector of the nmssm with explicit cp violation , at the one - loop level where the radiative corrections due to the quarks and squarks of the third generation are taken into account .",
    "the cp - odd tadpole minimum conditions at the one - loop level are analytically obtained , and the mass matrix for the five neutral higgs bosons are calculated .",
    "unlike the cp conserving case in the higgs sector of the nmssm , the upper bound on the mass of the lightest neutral higgs boson in the present model is found to increase as @xmath127 increases , in the parameter region set as @xmath132 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 gev , and @xmath136 gev .",

    "it is found that , in this parameter range , at least one of the five neutral higgs bosons may be produced at the ilc with @xmath1 gev with cross sections larger than 12 , 15 , and 1.5 fb , respectively , via the higgs - strahlung process , the @xmath2 fusion process , and the @xmath3 fusion process .",
    "these numbers suggest that it is possible for the ilc with @xmath1 gev to test the present model .",
    "further , the effects of the cp phase on the productions of the five neutral higgs bosons via the higgs - strahlung process , the @xmath2 fusion process , and the @xmath3 fusion process , are studied for the parameter region set as @xmath219 ( @xmath220 ) , @xmath182 , @xmath176 gev , @xmath168 , @xmath177 , @xmath170 gev , @xmath171 gev , @xmath172 gev , and @xmath173 gev .",
    "this is a one - dimensional subspace in @xmath89 direction of the parameter space where it is found that the production cross sections for at least one of the five neutral higgs bosons are minimum . in this one - dimensional parameter space of @xmath219 ,",
    "the cross sections of the five neutral higgs bosons are found to be seriously dependent on @xmath89 , regardless of via which process they are produced .",
    "their large fluctuations against @xmath89 suggest that the explicit cp violation in the nmssm through @xmath89 is indeed very crucial for the study of the higgs sector in the present model .",
    "the decay widths of the five neutral higgs bosons into various particles are also studied in the parameter region set as @xmath219 ( @xmath220 ) , @xmath182 , @xmath176 gev , @xmath168 , @xmath177 , @xmath170 gev , @xmath171 gev , @xmath172 gev , and @xmath173 gev .",
