    "in systems of sufficiently reduced symmetry it is possible to generate electrical currents on ultrafast time scales without any applied bias simply by the optical excitation with suitable laser pulses . in particular , in noncentrosymmetric semiconductor systems the non - vanishing second - order optical susceptibility @xmath1 allows one to generate photocurrents by excitation with a single optical pulse.@xcite as was shown by sipe _",
    "et al._@xcite , @xmath1 contains three different contributions which correspond to three kinds of photocurrent named injection , shift , and rectification currents .",
    "injection currents are caused by asymmetric populations of spin - polarized carriers in k - space which originate from dresselhaus and/or rashba spin splittings in systems of sufficiently reduced symmetry . to excite spin - polarized carriers circularly polarized light fields are required . without any additional electric or magnetic fields ,",
    "injection currents do not exist in bulk gaas , they are , however , present in gaas quantum wells ( qw ) with lower symmetry.@xcite    under the action of an optical field that induces interband transitions the electronic charge density in the noncentrosymmetric gaas crystal is shifted in real space from the as atoms towards the neighboring ga atoms and this process leads to the so - called shift current.@xcite additionally the spatial shift of bound electrons leads to a static polarization , i.e. , optical rectification . if the optical rectification is time varying , e.g. , due to the time dependence of the optical pulse envelope , it induces another kind of current : the rectification current . unlike injection currents which are created by",
    "resonantly excited carriers and shift currents which require a resonant excitation in first order and therefore exist for excitation frequencies above the band gap , rectification currents are present for all photon energies .",
    "previously we have developed a microscopic approach@xcite in which we employed the commonly used 14-band k.p method to obtain the electron bandstructure and the bloch functions for gaas qws and used the wave functions to formulate the multiband semiconductor bloch equations ( sbe ) .",
    "we solved the sbe to describe the optoelectronic response excited by ultrashort laser pulses . using this approach we analyzed injection currents generated by circularly polarized pulses in gaas qws and obtained results in quantitative agreement with experiment.@xcite when limiting our approach to a perturbative analysis we were able to reproduce the magnitude and the dynamics of the gaas shift current obtained in ref .  , where on the basis of a full ab - initio band structure a second - order ( @xmath1 ) analysis of the optical response was performed .    here",
    ", we further extend our approach to describe besides injection and shift currents also rectification currents .",
    "thus we are able to describe all three photocurrents that exist in the second - order response of noncentrosymmetric semiconductors@xcite in an unified way directly in the time domain and non - perturbatively in the light - matter interaction .",
    "we would like to point out that ( unlike to the case of injection currents ) due to the involved non - resonant excitations to higher bands the rotating wave approximation can not be applied for simulations of shift and rectification currents in the framework of bloch equations which significantly increases the numerical effort .",
    "we apply our microscopic approach to analyze shift and rectification currents in gaas qw systems .",
    "it is shown that for large enough excitation intensities non - perturbative effects arising from pauli blocking lead to a reduction of the peak values of the shift and rectification currents and to intensity - dependent temporal oscillations which originate from rabi flopping .",
    "the magnitude and direction of the photocurrents depend on the polarization direction of the incident pulse and the strength of different inter- and intersubband coherences to the currents strongly depends on the excitation geometry .",
    "furthermore , we find an oscillatory dependence of the currents on the photon energy , which is also confirmed experimentally .",
    "our simulations demonstrate that this dependence is caused by valence bandmixing .",
    "this is an interesting finding since is emphasizes the tremendous influence of bandmixing on transport phenomena and might be at the origin of new applications . to keep the numerical requirements within reasonable limits ,",

    "<S> a microscopic approach that is based on the multisubband semiconductor bloch equations formulated in the basis of a 14-band @xmath0 model is employed to compute the temporal dynamics of photocurrents in gaas quantum wells following the excitation with femtosecond laser pulses . </S>",
    "<S> this approach provides a transparent description of the interband , intersubband , and intraband excitations , fully includes all resonant as well as off - resonant excitations , and treats the light - matter interaction non - perturbatively . for linearly polarized excitations </S>",
    "<S> the photocurrents contain contributions from shift and rectification currents . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically compute and analyze these currents generated by the excitation with femtosecond laser pulses for [ 110]- and [ 111]-oriented gaas quantum wells . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the often employed perturbative @xmath1-approach breaks down for peak fields larger than about 10  kv / cm and that non - perturbative effects lead to a reduction of the peak values of the shift and rectification currents and to temporal oscillations which originate from rabi flopping . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find a complex oscillatory photon energy dependence of the magnitudes of the shift and rectification currents . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations demonstrate that this dependence is the result of mixing between the heavy- and light - hole valence bands . </S>",
    "<S> this is a surprising finding since the bandmixing has an even larger influence on the strength of the photocurrents than the absorption coefficient . for [ </S>",
    "<S> 110]-oriented gaas quantum wells the calculated photon energy dependence is compared to experimental results and a good agreement is obtained which validates our theoretical approach . </S>"
