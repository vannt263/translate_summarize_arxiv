    "the manipulation of the state of a quantum system with time - dependent interacting fields is a fundamental operation in atomic and molecular physics .",
    "modern applications of this quantum control such as quantum information processing @xcite require fast schemes with a high fidelity ( typically with an error lower than @xmath0 @xcite ) which must also be very stable with respect to imperfections of the system or fluctuations of the control parameters .    most methods used may be classified into two major groups : fast , resonant , fixed - area pulses , and slow adiabatic methods such as `` rapid '' adiabatic passage ( rap ) .",
    "fixed area pulses are traditionally considered to be fast but unstable with respect to perturbations . for two - level systems ,",
    "an example of a fixed area pulse is a @xmath1 pulse .",
    "a @xmath1 pulse may be fast but is highly sensitive to variations in the pulse area and to inhomogeneities in the sample @xcite .",
    "an alternative to a single @xmath1 pulse are composite pulses @xcite , which still need an accurate control of pulse phase and intensity . on the other hand ,",
    "the canonical robust option is to perform operations adiabatically @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , such schemes are slow and therefore likely to be affected by decoherence or noise over the long times required and do not lead to an exact transfer .",
    "a compromise is to use `` shortcuts to adiabaticity '' ( sta ) , which may be broadly defined as the processes that lead to the same final populations as the adiabatic approach but in a shorter time , for a review see @xcite .",
    "in particular , sta for two- and three - level systems are developed in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "nonetheless , in an experimental implementation , the system is never an ideal two- or three - level system",
    ". there may be unwanted couplings to other levels .",
    "the effect of such unwanted transitions for composite pulses has been examined and optimized in @xcite where it was also assumed that the phase of the unwanted coupling to another level could be controlled in a time - dependent way .",
    "the goal of this paper is to examine the effect of unwanted couplings to sta in two- and three - level quantum systems where we will assume that no control of the phase of the coupling to the unwanted level is possible .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows . in the subsequent section",
    ", we briefly review sta for two - level systems . in section [ sect3 ]",
    ", we examine the sensitivity of sta schemes to unwanted transitions and present schemes to minimize this sensitivity . in section [ sect4 ]",
    ", we review sta for three - level systems and we will examine and optimize their sensitivity to unwanted transitions in section [ sect5 ] .",
    "here we will review the derivation of invariant - based sta schemes in two - level quantum systems following the explanation given in @xcite .",

    "an example of such a quantum system would be a semiclassical coupling of two atomic levels with a laser in a laser - adapted interaction picture . in that setting @xmath5 would be the complex rabi frequency ( where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the real and imaginary parts ) and @xmath8 would be the time - dependent detuning between transition and laser frequencies . to simplify the language we will assume this setting for convenience in the following , noting that our reasoning will still pertain to any other two - level system such as a spin-@xmath9 particle or a bose - einstein condensate on an accelerated optical lattice @xcite . in other settings , @xmath10 and @xmath11 will correspond to different physical quantities .",
    "the goal is to achieve perfect population inversion in a short time in a two - level quantum system .",
