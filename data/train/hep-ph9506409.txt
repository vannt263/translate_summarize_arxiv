    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) may be described by a lagrangian containing interactions consistent with invariance under the gauge group @xmath3 and global supersymmetry plus a lagrangian containing a restricted set of soft supersymmetry breaking terms @xcite .",
    "these terms break supersymmetry while maintaining a useful property of a supersymmetric theory , namely the cancellation of quadratic divergences @xcite .",
    "the absence of these divergences is necessary in order to define the renormalized mass of a fundamental scalar , such as the higgs boson , without a fine - tuning of the cancellation between the bare mass and the scalar self - energy @xcite .",
    "the presence of fundamental scalar fields in the mssm , besides the higgs bosons , leads to the possibility that these fields may acquire non - zero vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) .",
    "since this would violate the conservation of color and/or electric charge symmetry , this leads to forbidden regions of the parameter space of the theory .",
    "we will calculate numerical estimates of the boundary of the allowed region of soft - breaking parameters using both the tree - level potential and the one - loop effective potential .",
    "many studies of the mssm mass spectrum neglect these charge / color breaking , or ccb , bounds in their analyses .",
    "previously , ccb bounds were obtained for various supersymmetric models , however no systematic numerical study of ccb constraints for a realistic approximation to the mssm using the one - loop effective potential has been done @xcite .",
    "one may assume that there are relations among the soft breaking terms , such as in the minimal supergravity model in which all scalar masses and scalar trilinear couplings are the same at the unification scale , of order @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "however we will find constraints on the soft - breaking parameters at a low - energy scale , @xmath5 , with @xmath6 .",
    "this is an indeterminate upper limit on particle masses if the mssm is to explain the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "we will not make any assumptions about the theory near the gut scale nor the particle spectrum above @xmath5 .",
    "we will use an approximation to the mssm that includes only the top flavor supermultiplets .",
    "this follows from evidence that the top quark mass @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "we use the conventional definition @xmath8 , with @xmath9 , @xmath10 the vevs for the higgs scalar fields , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively . assuming a small value for @xmath1 , near @xmath13 , gives the top quark yukawa coupling , @xmath14 . the contributions from the bottom supermultiplets",
    "may then be ignored .",
    "there are various reasons to choose these particular values of @xmath1 and to consider only the top squarks as acquiring a non - zero vev .",
    "first of all , there is an infrared quasi - fixed point in the renormalization group equation for @xmath15 which corresponds to a value @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the mass relation m_t(m_t ) = h_t^fp(m_t)(2)vgives @xmath17 if one uses the relation between the top quark mass defined by the pole in its propagator and its running mass to first - order in the qcd gauge coupling @xcite .",
    "m_pole = m_t(m_t ) .",
    "therefore a value of @xmath1 at @xmath5 in the range @xmath18 results from a large range of @xmath19 values at the gut scale .",
    "although @xmath1 is not required to be in this range , it indicates that this is a natural choice .",
    "one motivation for considering only the top sector comes from assuming common soft - breaking parameters at the gut scale .",
    "a large value of @xmath19 causes the third generation parameters to undergo the largest change as they are evolved from @xmath20 down to @xmath5 . for this same reason",
    ", @xmath19 also gives the largest contribution to the radiative gauge symmetry breaking of @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "therefore , if one assumes that the minimum of the effective potential at energy scales @xmath22 gives zero vevs for the scalar fields , such as in the case of universality at the gut scale , as one evolves to @xmath5 the third - generation parameters undergo the largest change and the ccb constraints from third generation scalar fields will be the most restrictive .",
    "finally , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the potential barrier height for tunneling from the the symmetric vacuum at a high temperature ( @xmath23 ) , early in the expansion of the universe , to a lower ccb minimum is proportional to @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the smallest of the yukawa couplings for the slepton and squark fields that have non - zero vevs at the ccb minimum .",
    "this implies that one should consider ccb vacua in which only the higgs fields and the top squarks have non - zero vevs in order for the tunneling from the symmetric to the ccb vacuum to have occurred in a time less than the present age of the universe ( @xmath26 years ) .",
    "we use a consistent approximation to the mssm with @xmath27 as a small value near the fixed point value and interactions with the bottom quark superfields are ignored .",
    "we use all mssm interactions between the following fields @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 are respectively the hypercharge @xmath36 and @xmath37 higgs boson doublets .",
    "the corresponding field variables with a tilde are the higgsino doublets . @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the left - handed component of the top quark and the right - handed component of the charge conjugate top quark field respectively . again , the corresponding field variables with tildes are the top squarks .",
    "@xmath34 is the gluon field and @xmath35 is the gluino field .",
    "notice that the field content in this approximation is supersymmetric .",
    "this arises from including all interactions with the top quark supermultiplet involving the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath38 .",
    "the potential in this approximation as well as the definitions of the parameters appearing in it are shown in the appendix .",
    "we use the values of the gauge couplings at the weak scale @xmath39 : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 for all calculations @xcite .",
    "since we will take the renormalization scale to be @xmath43 , the running of the gauge couplings from @xmath39 to this scale is negligible .",
    "we also omit the couplings @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the calculation of the one - loop effective potential .",
    "however , we retain the terms with these couplings at tree - level since they include the quartic higgs scalar interactions responsible for the non - zero higgs vev of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "quantum corrections may affect whether spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs in a field theory .",
    "the vevs of the scalar fields are the values of the classical fields at the minimum of the effective potential .",
    "we use the one - loop correction to the effective potential in the dimensional reduction , @xmath46 , renormalization scheme @xcite [ one - loop veff ] v_eff^1-loop = 1str , where the supertrace , @xmath47 , is over all color and spin degrees of freedom with a minus sign for fermions .",
    "@xmath48 is the square of the renormalization scale , which we take to be equal to @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 is the field dependent mass matrix ; for instance , for a theory with scalar fields @xmath51 _ ij = .^2v |_=_c . @xmath52 as well as @xmath53",
    "are function of the classical fields @xmath54 .",
    "since the top yukawa coupling , @xmath19 , and the strong gauge coupling , @xmath55 , are large one may expect significant contributions to the effective potential from one - loop corrections .",
    "the one - loop effective potential is also more stable under a change of renormalization scale @xcite . since the parameters appearing in the equation for the one - loop correction to @xmath53 are the renormalized parameters we consider the resulting ccb constraints as being limits on these renormalized parameters in the @xmath56 scheme at momentum scale @xmath5 .",
    "if large logs of ratios of massive parameters appear in the effective potential , such as @xmath57 or @xmath58 , then one may , in principle , sum these using the renormalization group equation @xcite . however , this is difficult when there are multiple scalar fields and masses .",
    "we only consider masses , @xmath59 , and the renormalization scale , @xmath5 , which differ by less than two orders of magnitude .",
    "furthermore , since we are only interested in the effective potential near its minimum where @xmath60 , i.e. , the classical field near the minimum of @xmath53 is of the same order of magnitude as the masses , the logarithms appearing in @xmath53 are small .",
    "renormalization group improvement of the effective potential in this case is unnecessary .",
    "we also assume that the lagrangian parameters are real . in a field basis where the higgs fields are real and positive and @xmath19 and the scalar masses , @xmath61 , real , only one of the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath38 , or @xmath62 may be made real by redefining the fields . however ,",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the presence of complex phases in these parameters , greater than about @xmath63 , gives too large of a contribution to the neutron s electric dipole moment due to gluino loops .",
    "we evaluate the one - loop effective potential using eq .",
    "( [ one - loop veff ] ) by diagonalizing the mass matrix @xmath52 .",
    "if one chooses the landau gauge for the gluons , in which the propagator is - , the generalized mass matrix @xmath52 is block diagonal in the gluon fields , bosonic fields , and fermionic fields .",
    "the top squark fields may also be rotated by a global @xmath64 transformation so that they are of the form _",
    "i = (    c q_1r + 0 + 0    ) , _ i = (    c t_1r + t_1i + t_2r + 0    ) , with @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 are real .",
    "we then use only the real part of the one - loop effective potential ; the imaginary part is related to the decay rate of the vacuum as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the global minimum of the effective potential is found by calculating the local minimum using a standard algorithm from ref .",
    "@xcite starting from a set of field values on a rectangular grid .",
    "if this global minimum occurs for non - zero values of the squark fields then there is a ccb vacuum .",
    "this process is repeated for a set of soft - breaking parameter values on a rectangular grid in parameter space .",
    "a quadratic surface is then fit to the parameter points on the boundary between those that give a symmetric vacuum and those that lead to a ccb vacuum .",
    "the surface is fit to the boundary points by varying the coefficients in the equation of the surface , @xmath69 , until the average of the distance squared from the boundary points to the nearest point on the surface , @xmath70 , is minimized .",
    "the equation of the surface is [ quadratic_surface ] a_t^4+p_1a_t^2+p_2m_2 ^ 4+p_3m_2 ^ 2 + p_4m_^4+p_5m_^2+p_6m_^4+p_7m_^2 -p_8=0 with @xmath71 a point in parameter space .",
    "these soft - breaking parameters are defined in the appendix .",
    "this particular parameterization of the surface is chosen solely because of its simplicity , but as will be seen later it gives an accurate characterization of the ccb boundary .",
    "because of the large dimension of the parameter space in which we want to find ccb bounds , it is necessary to initially constrain some of the parameters values in order to reduce the calculation time .",
    "two of the soft - breaking parameters , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , are constrained using two different methods . in method",
    "s the values of these parameters are chosen such that there is a standard model minimum in the effective potential with @xmath74 and @xmath75 , @xmath76 with @xmath77 .",
    "this is done by solving the analytical expression for the one - loop effective potential with zero vevs for the top squarks in terms of these parameters .",
