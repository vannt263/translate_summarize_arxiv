    "galactic cosmic rays are widely believed to be accelerated through the diffusive shock acceleration process at the shock of supernova remnants ( snrs )  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "it is generally expected that if a dense molecular cloud is overtaken by a supernova blast wave , the molecular cloud can be illuminated by relativistic particles accelerated at snr shocks  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if the accelerated particles are comprised mostly of protons , say @xmath3 times more abundant than electrons like the observed galactic cosmic rays , decays of neutral pions produced in inelastic collisions of the accelerated protons with dense gas are expected to be a dominant radiation component in the gamma - ray spectrum of the cosmic - ray - illuminated molecular cloud .",
    "thus , gamma - ray observations of snrs interacting with adjacent molecular clouds are important for the study of cosmic rays .",
    "the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope has recently detected gev gamma rays from several middle - aged snrs interacting with molecular clouds  @xcite .",
    "the gev emission from these snrs is bright and spatially coincident with molecular clouds , suggesting a hadronic origin as the most plausible explanation  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the lat spectra of these sources exhibit spectral breaks above a few gev and steepening above the breaks .",
    "a possible conventional mechanism for these spectral properties is the energy - dependent diffusion of accelerated particles from the snr shell into nearby molecular clouds  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , @xcite indicated that reaccelerated pre - existing cosmic - rays compressed at a radiative shock in a molecular cloud can explain the flat radio spectra and high gamma - ray luminosity observed in these snrs and that the alfv@xmath4n wave evanescence due to the strong ion - neutral collisions at the shock can cause the spectral breaks .",
    "thus , the observation of gev gamma rays from an additional snr in this class adds valuable information for the study of cosmic - ray acceleration in snrs and their interactions with surrounding matter and/or magnetic fields .",

    "no gamma - ray bursts were detected by the lat within 15@xmath13 of g8.7@xmath00.1 ; thus , we did not need to apply any additional time cut .",
    "the energy range analyzed here is restricted to @xmath11  200  mev to avoid possible large systematic uncertainties at lower energies due to the strong galactic diffuse emission  ( especially for g8.7@xmath00.1 , which lies in the direction of the galactic center ) , smaller effective area , and broader psf .",

    "the emission from secondary e@xmath73/e@xmath74 does not significantly contribute to the emission from g8.7@xmath00.1 in this modeling given the above @xmath71 .",
    "to consider the situation when the synchrotron emission from the secondaries dominates in the radio band , we model the gev emission with @xmath87 .",

    "the two models do not produce the emission at the same place . in the former",
    ", the gamma - ray emission comes from the cloud shock , which can be traced by non - thermal radio filaments .",
    "however , the spatial difference is too small to be resolved by the lat .",
    "therefore , we can not say which model is favorable for the gev emission .",
    "first , we consider the possibility that the gev gamma rays come from pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) .",
    "the ic emission from relativistic electrons is the most plausible process for the gamma - ray emission from pwne  @xcite .",
    "a pwn nearer to the earth than the location of g8.7@xmath00.1 is a possible candidate since the smaller distance loosens the constraint on energetics derived from an ic dominated model .",
    "there are several known or suspected pwne in this field , one associated with psr j1803@xmath02137  @xcite and another a pwn candidate found with suzaku , j1804@xmath02140  @xcite , which were found only in the x - ray band .",
    "if the ic emission contributes significantly to such a bright gev source , then the synchrotron emission in the radio band due to the corresponding electrons would be detectable unless the magnetic field is weaker than @xmath5  1 @xmath86 g .",

    "this snr is not located at the bright portion of the gev emission .",

    "the bulk of the gev gamma rays is most naturally explained by the decay of @xmath2s produced by the interaction of g8.7@xmath00.1 with molecular clouds .",
    "we consider the relation between the tev gamma - ray source , hess  j1804@xmath0216 , and the gev emission .",
    "one possibility is that the tev emission arises via the ic scattering of the relativistic electrons in a pwn .",
    "the sizes of the pwne found in the x - ray , which have extension of at most @xmath52@xmath6  @xcite , are @xmath5 40 times smaller than the extension of the tev gamma - ray source .",
    "tev emission from the ic process can be more extended than synchrotron x - ray emission from a pwn due to differences in radiative cooling times for the electrons generating the emission in those bands  @xcite . in the case of the pwn associated with psr j1803@xmath02137 , the extended tev gamma - ray emission ( @xmath5 30  pc )",
    "can be explained if the transporting velocity for the tev - emitting electrons averaged over the age of the pulsar ( 15.6  kr ;  @xcite ) is larger than @xmath5 1900 km s@xmath54 .",

    "on the other hand , the suzaku j1804@xmath02140 pwn is not well - studied and its origin remains unclear .",
    "therefore , we can not rule out the possibility of a pwn origin for the tev emission .",
    "another possibility is that the tev emission also originates in the particles accelerated in g8.7@xmath00.1 .",

    "on the other hand , we argue in section  [ sec : gev ] that the gev emission comes from the interaction of particles confined in the shell of g8.7@xmath00.1 with molecular clouds .",

    "this is not consistent with the particle spectrum obtained by the modeling of the gev spectrum as described before ; therefore , we extrapolate the particle spectrum above the threshold energy by using the broken power - law model .",
    "the index above the threshold is the same as the particle momentum spectrum used in figure  [ fig : spec](a ) .",
    "this requires that the momentum break energy ( @xmath5 3 gev c@xmath54 ) is consistent with the energy threshold of the escaped particles at the snr age .",
    "thus , @xmath105 is obtained to be 3.0 .",
    "this approximation for the gev spectrum reduces the amount of escaped particles just above the threshold compared to eq .",
    "( [ eq : diffusion ] ) , but it does not greatly affect the modeling of the tev emission since the energies of the contributing particles are much higher than the threshold .",
