    "ultracold atoms represents a distinct phase of matter for the exploration of fundamental quantum processes @xcite .",
    "the ability to precisely control ultracold systems has triggered investigations in different fields such as quantum simulation and information processing @xcite , quantum phase transitions @xcite and driven quantum systems @xcite .",
    "experimentally it is possible to control not only the external potentials but also the effective interactions between the atoms using feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "moreover , dimensionality can be tuned and in particular quasi one - dimensional systems can be achieved by confining two transverse degrees of freedom . in such waveguide - like systems , confinement induced resonances @xcite provide an additional tool to tune the interactions thus making the study of strongly correlated systems experimentally feasible . an interesting observation for a single species bosonic system in one dimension ,",
    "is that infinitely strongly repulsively interacting bosons possess the same local properties as a system of non - interacting fermions .",
    "this effect , known as fermionization has been experimentally observed @xcite and can be explained via the bose - fermi mapping @xcite .",
    "inspired by the results of single bosonic species , recently , there has been a lot of experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite interest in the static properties of multi - species bosonic mixtures . in these systems , the interplay between the inter- and intra - species forces as well as different masses or potential asymmetry gives rise to various phenomena and effects not accessible in the single component case .",
    "for instance , the process of composite fermionization occurs when the inter - species coupling is set to infinity and the strong repulsion provides different pathways for phase separation @xcite",
    ". moreover instabilities @xcite as well as new phases such as paired and counterflow superfluidity @xcite have been observed .",
    "focusing on the quantum dynamics , the double well provides the simplest prototype for a finite lattice and josephson junction and is especially a very elucidating case for studying the fundamental characteristics of quantum tunneling .",
    "theoretically , the tunneling dynamics of single species through the crossover from weak to strong interaction regimes reveal interesting effects such as josephson oscillations , pair tunneling , self trapping as well as fermionization @xcite which have also been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "more recently these studies have been extended also to systems of binary bosonic mixtures @xcite .",
    "these works demonstrate various effects such as macroscopic quantum self - trapping and coherent quantum tunneling @xcite , observations of collapse and revival of population dynamics @xcite , symmetry breaking and restoring scenarios @xcite as well as dipole oscillations induced pairing and counterflow superfluidity @xcite .",
    "however , most of the work has been done on the mean - field level either by solving gross - pitaevskii equations or by using the lowest band bose - hubbard model .",
    "although these studies do provide interesting insights into the mechanism of tunneling , an investigation of the complete crossover from the weak to strong interaction regime allows the examination of new effects and mechanisms not present e.g. in the mean field description .",
    "for instance referring to the case of two species in a harmonic trap , it has been found that if one species is localized due to its heavy mass then it can act as an effective material barrier through which the lighter component tunnels @xcite .",
    "the feedback of this material barrier leads to different pairing mechanisms for the light species .",
    "moreover , few body systems provide a bottom - up approach towards the understanding of many - body phenomena .",
    "experiments exploring few atom systems in finite optical lattices @xcite serve as promising setups for designing transistor - like structures from the perspective of atomtronics .",
    "in this paper we study the tunneling dynamics of a binary mixture of bosonic species in a one - dimensional double - well from a few body perspective . using the numerically exact multi - configuration time - dependent hartree method ( mctdh , see appendix [ sec : mctdh ] ) @xcite , we investigate the crossover from weak to strong interactions focusing in particular , on microscopic quantum effects and mechanisms which are prominent in few body systems .",
    "we demonstrate how the interplay between the inter- and intra- species interactions affect the rate and behavior of the tunneling in a non - trivial way .",
    "a strong increase of the tunneling period is observed as the inter - species repulsion is increased .",
    "however in certain cases , and especially for the strongly - interacting regime , increasing the intra - species interactions leads to an increase of the tunneling rates in contrast to what is observed for single species systems . preparing different initial states leads consequently to a diverse tunneling behavior . for complete imbalance of the populations , i.e. , when the particles are all prepared initially in the same well , or when the species are localized at different wells ( species separation ) the tunneling is strongly correlated meaning that the species tunnel either in phase or out of phase . only for very strong intra - species interactions",
    "these correlations are reduced . on the other hand for partial population imbalance",
    "e.g. one species is delocalized and the second one is localized , a mechanism of species separation and counterflow appears .",
    "the various effects are attributed to the features of the energy spectrum and explained by examining the density profile of the contributing stationary states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : setup ]",
    "we introduce our model and setup .",
    "subsequently we present and discuss the results for the quantum dynamics of the mixture with three bosons ( two bosons of species a and one of species b ) .",
    "three initial state scenarios are examined : complete population imbalance in sec . [",
    "sub:3p_imbalanced ] , complete species - separation in sec .",
    "[ sub:3p_separated ] , and partial imbalance in sec .",
    "[ sub:3p_part ] .",
    "the computational method mctdh is described in the appendix [ sec : mctdh ] .",
    "we consider a mixture of two species of bosons labeled by @xmath0 and @xmath1 in a one - dimensional double well potential .",
    "these may correspond to two different kinds of atoms or could be two hyperfine states of the same atomic species .",
    "the fact that there are two different species induces distinguishability and thus fundamentally alters the physics and in particular the quantum dynamics compared to the case of a single species .",
    "our hamiltonian reads ( see @xcite for details )    @xmath2 + \\sum_{i=1}^{n_{\\mathrm{a}}}\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{\\mathrm{b}}}v_{\\mathrm{ab}}(x_{\\mathrm{a},i}-x_{\\mathrm{b},j}).\\ ] ]     + where @xmath3 is the mass for species @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "we assume here that the different species obey the same single particle hamiltonian , i.e. , they possess the same mass and experience the same single - particle potential .",
    "the double - well potential @xmath4 is modeled as a harmonic potential with a central barrier shaped as a gaussian @xmath5 of width @xmath6 and height @xmath7 .",
    "dimensionless harmonic - oscillator units i.e. , @xmath8 , @xmath9 are employed throughout . in the ultracold scattering limit , one can approximate the interaction ( both intra-@xmath10 and inter - species @xmath11 ) with an effective contact potential @xcite    @xmath12    numerically we sample the delta - function as a very narrow gaussian ( choosing of course a spatial grid dense enough to sample this narrow peak ) .",
    "the different initial configurations are achieved by adding a tilt to the double - well which can be different for the two species depending on the required state . thus an individual well",
    "could be made energetically more favorable ( tilted ) for a certain species .",
    "for instance , to prepare a complete imbalance , the double wells of both species are tilted the same way , while to prepare a species - separated scenario @xmath13 is tilted opposite to @xmath14 . to prepare the partial population imbalanced state one has to tune the tilt for both species judiciously depending on the given interaction strength such that the required population configuration is achieved . the ground - state is then computed by the relaxation method and results in the desired initial state . for the study of the dynamics the tilt",
    "is instantaneously ramped down to obtain a symmetric double - well at @xmath15 .    in order to investigate systematically and in detail the tunneling processes for binary mixtures we consider the simplest non - trivial few - body system consisting of two bosons of species @xmath0 and one of species @xmath1 .",
    "this system captures the most important microscopic quantum dynamical processes occurring for few - body bosonic mixtures . in this case",
    "we have two independent parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( since there is only a single boson b species ) . when the inter - species interaction @xmath16 is zero ,",
    "the two components are completely decoupled meaning that the single b boson will undergo rabi oscillations between the wells .",
    "the a bosons will then follow a correlated two - particle dynamics regulated by the intra - species interaction @xmath17 ( this case is not addressed here but has been discussed in detail in the literature @xcite ) .",
    "another case which reduces to that of a single species is @xmath18 , where the essentials of the tunneling dynamics is that of three particles of a single species .",
    "our focus is exclusively onto the cases where we expect significant deviations from the single species scenario .",
    "we begin our study by exploring the quantum dynamics for an initial state where all the atoms are loaded into the left well . as observables ,",
    "we compute the time evolution of the one - particle density of each species and the resulting population in each well . for the right",
    "well we have    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the one - body density of the species @xmath21 and the total population of the right well is @xmath22 . due to symmetry and resonant mechanisms",
    ", we always have a complete transfer of the population of both species between the two wells which happens in most cases according to a periodic pattern with period @xmath23 .    .tunneling periods for different @xmath16 values for the case of complete imbalance .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the most important effect of increasing the interspecies interaction @xmath16 is a very strong increase of the tunneling period up to very large values .",
    "this can be seen in table [ table ] , where we show the tunneling period with increasing @xmath16 .",
    "this behavior is counter intuitive since with increasing repulsion between the species initially localized in the same well , one would expect the tunneling to be enhanced .",
    "the delayed tunneling is reminiscent of the one found for the case of a single species @xcite and is the few - body equivalent of self - trapping .",
    "the primary reason for this decrease of the tunneling frequency , especially for low interactions ( within the so - called bose - hubbard regime ) can be attributed to the energy spectrum presented in fig .",
    "[ cap:3p_energy_ga0_mag ] considering the states that contribute to the dynamics .",
    "the eigenstates are typically characterized by the superpositions of different number states such as @xmath24 , where the vector indicates two a boson occupying the left well and one b boson in the right well .",
    "as @xmath16 increases , different doublets are formed in this lowest band .",
    "the energetically highest doublet shown in fig .",
    "[ cap:3p_energy_ga0_mag ] , consisting primarily of the states @xmath25 , is of relevance to our case since these eigenstates possess maximum overlap with our initial state @xmath26 .     and small interaction strengths @xmath16 .",
    "[ cap:3p_energy_ga0_mag ] ]    with increasing @xmath16 , the number states @xmath26 and @xmath27 depart energetically from other number states due to their big on - site interaction energy , ( having all bosons in the same well ) and the eigenstates @xmath25 become increasingly degenerate thereby forming a doublet .",
    "the tunneling then consists oscillations between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , while the decreasing energy splitting of the doublet leads to an increase of the tunneling period .",
    "this is the few - body analogue of the self trapping mechanism in single - species condensates .",
    "the impressive fact though , is that this behavior is even more pronounced for higher interactions ( see eg .",
    "@xmath28 in table [ table ] ) , in contrast to the single species case ( see ref @xcite ) where there is a reduction of the period due to higher band contributions and fermionization ( with the particles tunneling as uncorrelated fermionized bosons with the corresponding rabi frequency ) in the strong interaction limit . in our case , as long as the interaction takes place predominantly between the different species ( here for simplicity @xmath29 ) , firstly there is no fermionization in the regular sense , and secondly , the particles tunnel in a highly correlated manner - meaning that the initial localized state @xmath26 does not tunnel to states like @xmath30 or @xmath31 since they possess much lower interaction energy and are thus energetically off resonant . the fact that we encounter correlated particle tunneling ( all bosons together ) is documented by the probability of finding all the particles in the same well which remains very close to unity throughout the dynamics . as a first conclusion , we see that the repulsive inter - species interaction causes binding between the particles and reduces the tunneling rates .       of species a and ( b ) @xmath32 of species",

    ", one also observes rapid small amplitude oscillations .",
    "concerning @xmath23 , we obtain a monotonic increase as @xmath35 .",
    "however this behavior changes as we go beyond the weak interaction regime for @xmath17 and we observe a decrease of the tunneling period for @xmath36 .",
    "another important feature is that the two components a and b undergo roughly the same evolution of the oscillation pattern ( compare fig .",
    "[ cap : left_3p_gab02 ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) which is suggestive of strong inter and intra - species correlations in the sense that all bosons tunnel together .",
    "this changes slightly only for very strong interaction @xmath37 , where the tunneling period reduces substantially while the pattern becomes more erratic consisting of two primary oscillations and unlike the previous cases , the dynamics of the two components is not completely identical .",
    "this indicates , in the line of argumentation provided above , a reduction of the correlations between the two species and attempted single - particle tunneling .    within the weak interaction regime where the effective lowest band number states description is valid ,",
    "the tunneling process of shuffling between the two completely localized states @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be more specifically described by the sequence @xmath38 .",
    "the effective tunneling rate within this lowest band description , is in general approximately given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the effective coupling term between the two sites and @xmath41 is the energy of the initial and final number - state of the tunneling and @xmath42 are the energies of the intermediate number - states respectively , which in this case are @xmath31 and @xmath30 .",

    "we have investigated the tunneling dynamics of a strongly correlated few body bosonic binary mixture in a one - dimensional double - well covering the complete range of intra- and inter - species interaction .",
    "our focus is the interplay of the inter- and intra - species correlations and their impact on the dynamics .",
    "we observe that the tunneling period increases drastically as the inter - species interaction @xmath16 increases which is due to quasi - degenerate symmetric states contributing primarily to the dynamics .",
    "this effect is quite general and observed here for different initial configurations .",
    "the intra - species coupling @xmath17 possesses a different impact on the behavior of the dynamics , depending on the strength @xmath16 as well as on the initial state .",
    "the general trend is that for large @xmath17 the overlap of localized wave functions of contributing states becomes larger and thus the effective tunneling coupling is increased leading to higher tunneling frequencies . for low interactions though different behavior is encountered for different setups . for a completely imbalanced initial state , for instance",
    ", we observe that for small values of @xmath16 , the tunneling period increases as we increase @xmath17 in the weak interaction regime .",
    "however for larger values of @xmath17 , the tunneling period reduces with increasing @xmath17 .",
    "this behavior is not seen for the species - separated initial condition . in the latter case",
    ", we observe a minimal period at @xmath85 which is a manifestation of an avoided crossing in the spectrum .    concerning the different initial states of the ensemble the complete population imbalanced state exhibits generically a completely correlated tunneling process for the a and b species which breaks only for large values of @xmath17 leading to an attempted single particle tunneling and independent fermion - like behavior .",
    "for the species separated scenario the two species tend to stay in opposite wells when the inter - species repulsion is large , a behavior which alters only if @xmath17 becomes also large . for the partially population imbalanced case",
    "where the mean population of a atoms in each well @xmath86 , although one would intuitively expect that the a particles remain in different wells due to their initial preparation , this happens only if the interaction between them is considerably large . in the other cases the a particles undergo oscillations and the initially mixed state where an a and a b boson coexist in the same well can turn into a separated state for which the a and b species reside in different wells",
    ".    understanding the fundamental effects and mechanisms of the tunneling dynamics in strongly correlated bosonic mixtures on a few body level can be seen as a starting point to realize systems such as bosonic transistors or to create schemes for selective transport of individual bosonic component in reservoir - sink systems as well as for studies of entanglement and statistical properties of mixed ensembles .",
    "further considerations could include higher number of particles or species and effects of parameters which differentiate the two species .",
    "our goal is to study the bosonic quantum dynamics for weak to strong interactions in a numerically exact fashion .",

    "the unknown single particle functions @xmath90 , where @xmath91 refers to the total number of single particle functions used in the calculation ) are in turn represented in a fixed primitive basis implemented on a grid .",
    "the correct bosonic permutation symmetry is obtained by symmetrization of the expansion coefficient @xmath92 .",
    "note that in the above expansion , not only are the coefficients @xmath92 time dependent but also the single particle functions @xmath93 . using the dirac - frenkel variational principle",

    "integrating these differential equations of motion gives us the time evolution of the system via ( [ eq : mctdh ] ) .",
    "this has the advantage that the basis @xmath95 is variationally optimal at each time @xmath96 .",
    "thus it can be kept relatively small , rendering the procedure more efficient .    although mctdh is designed primarily for time dependent problems , it is also possible to compute stationary states . for this purpose",
    "the _ relaxation _ method is used @xcite .",
    "the key idea is to propagate a wave function @xmath97 by the non - unitary operator @xmath98 .",
    "as @xmath99 , this exponentially damps out any contribution but that stemming from the true ground state like @xmath100 . in practice one relies upon a more sophisticated scheme called the _ improved relaxation _",

    "we note here that the computation of very long tunneling times using the mctdh propagation scheme is numerically impractical .",
