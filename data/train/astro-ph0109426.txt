    "most low mass stars spend some time at the end of their lives as planetary nebulae ( pne ) before they die away as cooling white dwarfs .",
    "the processes by which these spherically symmetrical low mass stars become often highly asymmetric pne are not well understood . especially strong asymmetries exist in the sub  class of bipolar pne .",
    "candidates for the formation of bipolar pne include binary central objects , fast rotating single stars with strong magnetic fields , and interacting wind models .",
    "although , for the more extremely collimated nebulae , a binary system is becoming a generally accepted necessity . a glance at balick ( 1987 ) , schwarz et al . ( 1992 ) and",
    "grny et al . ( 1999 ) shows that a majority of pne are significantly asymmetrical . a recent overview of asymmetrical pne is given in kastner et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "bipolar pne have been shown to have properties very different from those of the general population of pne ( corradi & schwarz , 1995 ) .",
    "they form an interesting group combining shocks and photoionization , dust and gas , and very high outflow velocities with interesting kinematics .",
    "they have giant dimensions ( several are @xmath8 1pc ) , central stars with higher mass ( as in type i pne ) , and surprisingly , evidence shows they have lower than typical luminosities ( corradi & schwarz , 1995 ) . in some cases , the combination of high temperatures and excitation with low luminosity and the presence of a variable near infra - red ( nir ) source indicates the presence of a compact , hot binary component . in the case of m29 , measurable expansion parallax ( schwarz et al .",
    "1997 ) and internal movements ( doyle et al . 2000 ) have been observed .",
    "several bipolar pne possess point ",
    "symmetry and are , strictly speaking , not plane  symmetric as are the other bipolar pne .",
    "the point ",
    "symmetry can be spectacularly clear ( schwarz 1993 , lpez et al .",
    "1993 ) and has been suggested to be due to precession in the binary orbit of the central object ( schwarz et al .",
    "1992 , livio 2000 ) .    the bipolar nebula sa2 - 237 ( pn g011.1 + 07.0 , 17@xmath944@xmath1042@xmath11 -154513j2000 . ) which is briefly presented in a poster paper by masegosa et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , is discussed in some detail in this paper .",
    "information on sa2 - 237 is sparse , a simbad search only resulted in iras fluxes , and a heliocentric systemic radial velocity measurement of -81km@xmath2s@xmath3 .",
    "the 18 references since 1983 are all to catalogs or papers discussing samples of pne ; apart from the masegosa poster , no papers have been found about the object itself .",
    "the kinematic and morphological analysis of sa2 - 237 presented here will hopefully advance the understanding of the interesting characteristics of bipolar pne .",
    "the spectra were secured with emmi , the eso multi mode instrument , mounted at the ntt , during the night of 2000.12.04 . using the long slit echelle mode with grating 14 results in a resolution of 0.004 nm per pixel on the ccd .",
    "a slit width of 08 on the sky gives a spectral resolving power of 70000 spatially projecting onto 2.2 pixels .",
    "the ccd was a tektronix tk2048eb 2k@xmath12 chip with 24@xmath13 pixels each covering 028 on the sky along the slit of 300 length .",
    "the ccd has a ron of 5e , a dark current of 1.7e pix@xmath3@xmath2hr@xmath3 , and was used with a gain of 2.17e@xmath2adu@xmath3 in the unbinned mode .",
    "the order of the echelle grating was selected by using an h@xmath0 filter ( eso no.596 ) passing also the [ nii ] lines at 654.8 & 658.3 nm , or an [ oiii]500.7 nm filter ( eso no.589 ) .",
    "the exposure times were 4800s ( in two 2400s exposures ) for the h@xmath0 spectrum , and 2400s for the [ oiii ] spectrum .",
    "for details on the ntt , emmi and it s filters and gratings , see www.ls.eso.org/lasilla/telescopes/newntt/    the images were also taken with emmi , but used in the rild imaging mode .",
    "the same eso filters used for the spectra were used to acquire the images , and the exposure times were 500s for the [ oiii ] image and 300s for h@xmath0 .",
    "the observations were reduced in the usual way using the iraf package ( see www.iraf.noao.edu ) and the resulting images and spectra are shown in figures  1 & 2 respectively .",
    "our images show a bipolar nebula with a narrow waist extending over about 34 , and point symmetry about the central object .",
    "the lobes are oriented more or less to the e and w , and are brighter in the northern part of the e lobe and the southern part of the w lobe . in the extreme nw of the w lobe there is a faint loop visible , indicated by an arrow in figure  1 , which may have an even fainter counterpart in the opposite lobe .",
    "deeper imaging may be able to resolve this , and also determine if there is fainter emission further away from the central object .",
    "several other bipolars have had faint emission detected far from the brighter parts of the nebula : e.g. mycn18 ( bryce et al . 1997 ) & m29 kohoutek & surdej 1980 ) therefore it is worth looking for this around sa2237 .",
    "the object is extended in 2mass nir images , with the e lobe being the brighter , and the central object is much brighter than the nebula .",

    "we are aware that there is very faint emission at higher velocities but the sn ratio is too low to use these data for velocity calculations .",
    "also , the smearing out due to seeing dictates the use of the fitted peaks for velocity determinations .",

    "an explanation lies in the behavior of the material and the excitation lines .",
    "[ nii ] and other low excitation lines ( e.g. [ oi ] , [ sii ] ) form in the outer regions of these nebulae , while [ oiii ] is typically found closer to the central object .",
    "the velocity of the material tends to be directly proportional to the distance from the central object , hence the higher velocities in the [ nii ] line as shown in sa2237 .",
    "as far as we are aware , this is the first time that this effect has been observed in a bipolar nebula ; it is common in elliptical pne .",
    "a small intensity asymmetry between the blue and red shifted loops in the spectra indicates the likely possibility of a small misalignment of the slit .",
    "such an offset would show up as an intensity asymmetry due to the point symmetric nature of the nebula .",
    "an estimated offset of 05 from the central object is sufficient to have caused this effect .",
    "our conclusions , however , are not affected by this small offset .    we have derived the systemic velocity as the centre of the point symmetry of the eight shaped velocity  space plot .",
    "this follows directly from our modeling and is an accurate estimate of the system radial velocity . by applying the appropriate correction",
    "we find the heliocentric radial velocity of sa2237 to be -30km@xmath2s@xmath3 .",
    "the lsr velocity for sa2237 is -16km@xmath2s@xmath3 .",
    "note that this is significantly different from the velocity reported by beaulieu et al .",
    "1998 & durant et al 1998 ) . for objects at l=11  in the galactic plane",
    "we expect a small positive velocity of about v@xmath20=+10km@xmath2s@xmath3 at 2kpc .",
    "our v@xmath20=-16km@xmath2s@xmath3 , possibly indicates somewhat peculiar kinematics for sa2237 but we still place the object in the disk , albeit a bit far from the plane for a bipolar ( type i ) pn at 255pc . with the beaulieu velocity",
    "it would have been impossible to kinematically place sa2237 in the disk .",
    "the fluxes and magnitudes listed in section  1 are used to create the energy distribution of sa2237 in figure  3 .",
    "the nir values plotted are those from persi et al .",
    "1987 , since they are nearly co  eval with the iras data .",
    "there is clearly a major contribution from the iras fluxes compared to the visible and nir .",
    "this is addressed further below . integrating the _ fluxes _ over wavelength , and correcting by a factor of 1.5 ( meyers et al .",
    "1987 ) for the unobserved parts of the spectrum , yields l=77d@xmath12l@xmath7 for the luminosity of sa2237 , where d is the distance to sa2237 in kiloparsecs .",
    "using a simple model for the shape and kinematics of a generic bipolar nebula , in the manner of solf & ulrich ( 1985 ) , we fit the morphology and spectrum of sa2237 simultaneously .",
    "the model has the following properties : the velocity of expansion is proportional to the distance from the center of the material , there is symmetry about the equatorial plane , and no time evolution .",
    "the nebula therefore expands in a self  similar way .",
    "the parameters are : the polar expansion velocity , v@xmath21 , the ratio of polar to equatorial velocity , r@xmath22 , the inclination to the line of sight of the polar axis , i , and the age@xmath2distance@xmath3 , p@xmath23 .",
    "the expansion velocity as a parametrized function of latitude in the nebula is given by : + v(@xmath24 ) = v@xmath25+(v@xmath21-v@xmath25)sin@xmath26(@xmath27 ) + where @xmath24 is the latitude , v@xmath25 & v@xmath21 are the equatorial and polar expansion velocities respectively , and @xmath28 is the shape factor .",
    "for more details see the paper by solf & ulrich ( 1985 ) whose parametrization we have followed here .    by fitting the shape of the image and the spectrum simultaneously ,",
    "we derive the following parameters for sa2237 : the inclination , i , to the line of sight is 70and the maximum expansion velocity is 260km@xmath2s@xmath3 .",
    "we estimate the distance to sa2237 from the observational and literature data .",
    "comparision with m29 , a well studied pn ( although some authors consider it to be a symbiotic nova ; sa2237 may well be such a nove as well ) which has a similar morphology as sa2237 and a well - determined distance of 640pc ( schwarz et al .",
    "1997 ) , and with mira , gives the following results : + scaling the m29 distance of to that of sa2237 by the object s 1.4  ghz radio fluxes gives 1.66kpc , by luminosity gives 2.68kpc and by size gives 2.11kpc . a similar comparison with the iras flux of o  cet , which has an accurate hipparcos distance of 168pc , and assuming that the cool component in sa2237 is also a mira , made plausible by the @xmath291.5mag variability of sa2237 , gives 1.96kpc .",
    "the average distance to sa2237 based on these four estimates , is 2.1kpc , with a standard deviation of 0.37kpc , which can be taken as the formal error on this value .",
    "_ we therefore adopt a distance of 2.1kpc@xmath60.37kpc to sa2237 .",
    "_    the distance of 2.1kpc is used to compute the following parameters for sa2237 .",
    "the size of the object is 0.37pc , it s luminosity is 340l@xmath7 , and the age of the nebula , assuming constant expansion velocity , is 624yrs . using the model - derived inclination of i=70@xmath4 , the space velocity of expansion of sa2237 is 308km@xmath2s@xmath3 , using the maximum measured expansion velocity 2v@xmath30 .",
    "note that this tends to slightly overestimate the space expansion velocity since the maximum projected velocity , for objects near the plane of the sky , is not the polar one , but more due to material at an inclination angle marginally smaller than the 70derived from the model , and located at a latitude slightly below the poles of the nebula .",
    "this would bring the observed space velocity nearer that derived from the model ( see also below ) .    comparing the results derived from the observational data with the model parameters",
    ", we get that the agedistance parameter , p@xmath23=0.30 , in good agreement with p@xmath23=0.28 from the model , given the uncertainties in all parameters .",
    "the computed expansion polar velocity at i=70@xmath4 is 308km@xmath2s@xmath3 , cf .",
    "260km@xmath2s@xmath3 from the model fitting .",
    "note that only 4@xmath4 difference in i , that is i=66@xmath4 , gives 260km@xmath2s@xmath3 instead of 308km@xmath2s@xmath3 , making also this a reasonable agreement .",
    "_ we therefore adopt a space expansion velocity of @xmath5308km@xmath2s@xmath3 for sa237 . _    all these parameters are typical of bipolar nebulae , and this strengthens our confidence that sa2237 is indeed a bipolar pn or symbiotic nova such as m29 , he2104 , or bi  cru ( corradi & schwarz ( 1993 ) and various others .    the orientation near the plane of the sky of sa2237 implies that the central object is likely obscured by equatorial material , which would cause a large extinction .",
    "there must be a pole to equator density gradient to produce the bipolar shape , with the highest density at the equator .",
    "this is the reason why the iras contribution is much larger than the optical+nir flux , as the fir radiation comes from the equatorial disk as reprocessed optical and nir flux absorbed in the torus .",
    "the energy distribution of m29 is similar and this object is also near the plane of the sky .",
    "note that radio fluxes are not ( or much less ) affected by this and the distance ratios computed from the radio and iras fluxes confirm this : the radio distance is smaller ( 1.66kpc ) than the iras ( @xmath31 luminosity ) distance ( 2.68kpc ) , indicating some extinction in the iras flux but none in the radio",
    ".    one can , over the next years , attempt to measure the expansion parallax for sa2237 , as we have done for m29 , as it should be 0053 yr@xmath3 , at our distance of 2.1kpc .",
    "taking one or two images per year would give a result within a few years , and would allow a direct check on our derived distance .",
    "we have started such a program of observations .    in the images ,",
    "the nucleus of the nebula is relatively bright , but in the spectra no strong h@xmath0 emission appears .",
    "it is likely that it is a stellar spectrum , not an emission line core , as in symbiotic stars",
    ". it would be interesting to take a spectrum of this star and attempt to classify it .",
    "we summarize the properties of sa2237 .",
    "it is a bipolar planetary nebula , similar to m29 , m116 and others , projecting 34onto the sky , at a distance of 2.1kpc , with a size of 0.37pc , l=340l@xmath7 , and expanding at 2v@xmath32=616km@xmath2s@xmath3 .",
    "it s point symmetric morphology hints at the presence of precession and thus the central object may well be a binary .",
    "the object s inclination is 70to the line of sight .",
    "based on the symmetry in the observed expansion velocities , we adopt a heliocentric radial velocity for sa2237 of -30km@xmath2s@xmath3 , and place it in the galactic disk at z=255pc .",
    "we suggest that the expansion parallax can be measured on a relatively short time scale as it is @xmath31005 p.a .",
    "this would confirm or adjust the distance to sa2237 .",
    "spectra of the central object may tell us what properties it has , as it seems to be stellar in nature and not an emission line core , as in many other such objects .",
