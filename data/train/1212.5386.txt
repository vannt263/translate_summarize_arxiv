    "however , biologically most interesting is the _ selective case _ where the evolutionary success of an individual depends on its ( allelic ) type and where also mutation ( i.e.  random changes in types ) may occur .",
    "this case including mutation and selection was studied in @xcite .",
    "we note that rather than studying the full - tree valued process in the infinite population limit , it is possible to obtain limits of its functionals directly as well . for the neutral tree - valued fleming - viot process , this has been done for the height @xcite and the length @xcite .",
    "in addition , functionals of other tree - valued processes have been studied , e.g.  for the height of the tree in branching processes @xcite and for the height and length of a population with the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent as long - time limit @xcite .",

    "in addition , population models have specific features that will also be useful .",
    "for example all individuals have unique ancestors even though not all individuals have descendants and if an individual has a descendant , she might as well have many .",
    "this simple structure can be used for finite population models ( e.g.  the moran model ) or the tree - valued fleming ",
    "viot process , since this infinite model arises as a large - population limit from finite moran models ( for the neutral case see theorem  2 of @xcite and for the selective case theorem  3 of @xcite ) to derive properties of the family structure .",
    "an important point of the proofs is that we can transfer properties from the neutral case since for most forms of selection ( which are determined by the interacting fitness functions , which gives the dependence of the offspring distribution depends on the allelic type ) , the resulting process is _ absolutely continuous _ to the _ neutral case _ ( which comes with no dependency between allelic type and offspring distribution ) via a _ girsanov transform_.    * outline : * the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ s.tvfv ] we recall the definition of the state space of the tree - valued fleming ",
