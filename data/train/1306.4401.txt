    "dynamics of collective opinion formation is widely studied in various disciplines including statistical physics . in typical models of opinion formation ,",
    "agents interact and dynamically change the opinion , which i call the state , according to others states and perhaps the agent s own state .",
    "the voter model is a paradigmatic stochastic model of this kind @xcite . in the voter model",
    ", each agent flips the binary state at a rate proportional to the number of neighboring agents possessing the opposite state . in arbitrary finite contact networks and in some infinite networks ,",
    "the stochastic dynamics of the voter model always ends up with perfect consensus of either state . the time required before the consensus",
    "is reached has been characterized in many cases .",
    "the possibility of consensus and the relaxation time , among other things , have also been examined in other opinion formation models @xcite .",
    "the voter model as well as many other opinion formation models assume that the population is homogeneous .",
    "in fact , real agents are considered to be heterogeneous in various aspects .",
    "the agents heterogeneity has been incorporated into the voter model in the form of , for example , heterogeneous degrees ( i.e. , number of neighbors ) in the contact network @xcite , positions in the so - called watts - strogatz small - world network @xcite , heterogeneity in the flip rate @xcite , and zealosity @xcite .    in the present study ,",
    "i examine extensions of the voter model in which some agents are not like - minded voters .",
    "such contrarian agents would transit to the state opposite to that of others and were first studied in ref .",
    "it should be noted that contrarians are assumed to dynamically change their states ; contrarians are assumed to be zealots ( i.e. , those that never change the state ) in a previous study @xcite . in models in which consensus is the norm in the absence of contrarians , contrarians often prohibit the consensus to be reached such that the dynamics finally reaches the coexistence of different states .",
    "this holds true for the majority vote model @xcite , ising model @xcite , so - called sznajd model @xcite , a model with a continuous state space @xcite , and a general model including some of these models @xcite .",
    "these models show phase transitions between a consensus ( or similar ) phase and a coexistence phase when the fraction of contrarians in the population ( i.e. , quenched randomness ) @xcite or the probability of the contrarian behavior adopted by all the agents in the population ( i.e. , annealed randomness ) is varied @xcite .",
    "the effects of contrarians have been also examined in the so - called minority game @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these nonlinear models , i focus on three linear extensions of the voter model with contrarian agents ( i.e. , quenched randomness ) . by linearity ,",
    "i mean to pertain to stochastic mass interaction . a previous study numerically examined coevolutionary dynamics of a linear extension of the voter model with contrarians and network formation @xcite . in contrast , i focus on a fixed and well - mixed population .",
    "i show that even a small density of contrarians changes the collective dynamics of the extended voter models from the consensus configuration to the coexistence configuration .",
    "i also analytically quantify the fluctuations in the agents behavior in the coexistence equilibrium .",
    "i consider three variants of the voter model with contrarians . the agent that obeys the state transition rule of the standard voter in the voter model",
    "is referred to as congregator . the fraction of congregators and that of contrarians are denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "contrarian is assumed to be a quenched property . in other words ,",
    "an agent is either congregator or contrarian throughout the dynamics .",

    "i assume that the population is well mixed and contains @xmath9 agents .",
    "the continuous - time stochastic opinion dynamics is defined as follows .",

    ", each congregator in state @xmath3 flips to state @xmath2 with the rate equal to the number of @xmath2 agents .",
    "this assumption is common to the three models .",
    "the behavior of the congregator in the present models is the same as that of the voter in the standard voter model .",
    "the three models are different in the behavior of contrarians as follows . in model 1",
    ", it is assumed that contrarians oppose congregators and like contrarians . in other words ,",
    "each contrarian in state @xmath2 independently flips to state @xmath3 with the rate equal to the sum of the number of @xmath2 congregators and that of @xmath3 contrarians . in model 2 ,",
