2.16 m telescope in china ; the kitt peak 2.3 m bok telescope and the 6.5 m mmt telescope in the u.s . ; and the 2.3 m anu telescope in australia . we have observed 99 candidates from our main sample and 64 ( 64.6% ) of them are high - redshift quasars with a redshift of @xmath121 .",
    "we also observed 14 fainter candidates from our fainter candidates sample and 8 ( 57.1% ) of them are quasars at @xmath6 .",
    "one of our candidates ( j135457.62@xmath29314851.4 ) in our bright main sample was identified to be a low redshift low - ionization broad absorption line quasar ( felobal qso ) .",
    "however , we can not give the accurate redshift due to strong iron absorptions .",
    "the other 40 spectroscopic observed candidates are not quasars and were either identified as cool dwarfs or had relative low s / n and could only be ruled out as quasars .",
    "table 2 lists the observational information of the 72 new identified quasars .",
    "the lijiang 2.4 m telescope is located at lijiang observatory , yunnan observatories , chinese academy of sciences ( cas ) .",
    "it is equipped with the yunnan faint object spectrograph and camera ( yfosc ) which can take spectra followed by photometric images with a very short switching time .",
    "we observed 48 candidates by using the yfosc , with a 2k @xmath122 4k ccd detector and three different grisms based on the brightness of our candidates .",
    "we used grism 3 ( g3 ) with dispersion of 172 @xmath111/mm and wavelength coverage from 3200 to 9200 @xmath111 to observe the brightest candidates ; grism 5 ( g5 ) , with dispersion of 185 @xmath111/mm and wavelength coverage from 5000 to 9800 @xmath111 , to observe fainter candidates ; and grism 12 ( g12 ) , with dispersion of 900 @xmath111/mm and wavelength coverage from 5600 to 9900 @xmath111 to observe the faintest candidates in our sample .",
    "we used a @xmath123 slit for all three grisms .",
    "this slit yields a resolution of @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 for the g3 , g5 and g12 grisms , respectively .",
    "we observed 35 candidates using the red channel spectrograph @xcite on the mmt 6.5 m telescope .",
    "we used the 270@xmath127 grating centered at 7500 @xmath111 , providing coverage from 5500 to 9700 @xmath111 .",
    "we used the @xmath128 or @xmath129 slits based on the seeing , providing resolutions of @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively .",
    "we observed 16 candidates using the boller and chivens spectrograph ( b&c ) on steward observatory s 2.3 m bok telescope at kitt peak with the g400 grating and @xmath132 slit which gave a resolution of @xmath133 and @xmath134 wavelength coverage .",
    "we observed eight candidates using the bao faint object spectrograph and camera ( bfosc ) on the 2.16 m optical telescope at the xinglong station of the national astronomical observatories , chinese academy of sciences ( naoc ) .",
    "we used the g4 or g10 gratings with dispersion of 198 @xmath111/mm and 392 @xmath111/mm , respectively .",
    "the wavelength coverage of these two gratings are 4000 - 7800 @xmath111 and 4300 - 9000 @xmath111 with spectral resolutions of @xmath135 and @xmath136 with a @xmath137 slit , respectively .",
    "note that we also one of the candidates ( j1523 + 5916 ) using the mmt .",
    "we also used the wide field spectrograph ( wifes ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an integral - field double - beam image - slicing spectrograph on the anu 2.3 m telescope at siding spring observatory , to observe seven of our quasar candidates .",
    "they were observed using grating r3000 on wifes which gives a resolution of @xmath138 at wavelengths between 5300@xmath111 and 9800 @xmath111 .",
    "all spectra taken by the 2.4 m telescope , 2.16 m telescope , 2.3 m bok telescope , and mmt telescope were reduced using standard iraf routines .",
    "the wifes data were reduced with a python based pipeline pywifes @xcite .",
    "the flux calibrations of all spectra were obtained from standard star observations on the same night and scaled to sdss @xmath23-band magnitudes for absolute flux calibrations .",

    "there are three reasons that they are not in the sdss quasar catalogs : ( 1 ) 38 of them are not in the sdss dr7 photometry sky coverage and thus not in the sdss main spectroscopy survey region ; ( 2 ) 25 new quasars have the quasar target flag set by the latest sdss target selection pipeline but were not observed either because these candidates are at the edge of sdss main spectroscopy survey or the fields of these candidates were observed at the early stage of the sdss ( e.g. sdss edr and dr1 ) when a preliminary version of the selection pipeline was used ( richards et al .",
    "2002 ) , and ( 3 ) the other nine new quasars were not targeted by sdss altogether .",
    "these nine quasars were rejected by the photometric flags ( e.g. blended , interp_center , child , and family ) .",
    "although the sdss high - redshift quasar target selection method can recover many of these newly discovered quasars , the efficiency ( less than 10% ) of the sdss target selection is much lower than that ( @xmath860% ) of our method by combining sdss and allwise colors .",
    "in addition , our method improved both the completeness and efficiency for selecting @xmath86 quasars ( the region between the purple dashed line and the orange dashed line in figure 4 ) .",
    "-band magnitude diagram of sdss dr7 @xmath10 quasars .",
    "the red circles denote quasars that satisfy our selection method while blue crosses denote quasars that do not satisfy our selection method .",
    "the purple line represents @xmath107band magnitudes equal to 19.5.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      in our spectroscopic observations @xmath860% of our candidates are real high - redshift quasars , which is a relatively high efficiency for selecting high - redshift quasars .",
    "although our optical color cuts are very sensitive to @xmath166 ( figure 4 ) , quasars at @xmath164 have a bluer @xmath40 color and lead to a lower completeness of our selection method in this redshift range ( figures 3 and figure 8) . at @xmath2 ,",
    "the _ wise _ @xmath35 and @xmath36 bands only cover quasar rest - frame optical emission ( shorter than @xmath167 m ) , which is not significantly polluted by the hot dust ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath40 color changes a lot from redshift 4.5 to 5.5 as the @xmath113 emission line moves from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "more than half of quasars at @xmath164 have a bluer @xmath40 with @xmath165 . at this redshift range , the @xmath113 emission line redshifts into the @xmath35 band .",
    "quasars with weaker @xmath113 emission lines or redder continuum will prefer redder @xmath40 colors and quasars with stronger @xmath113 emission lines or bluer continuum will show bluer @xmath40 colors .",
    "so our @xmath40 cut will bias to quasars with weaker @xmath113 emissions or redder continuum at @xmath164 . at @xmath76 ,",
    "the @xmath113 emission line moves out from @xmath35 band and the @xmath40 colors change to be redder and our @xmath40 cut will not bias to quasars emission line and continuum properties significantly .",
    "overall , our selection method can select luminous quasars at @xmath1 with both high efficiency and relatively high completeness ( e.g. figure 7 ) . benefiting from this",
    "we are able to study the qlf at @xmath2 , especially at the bright end of the qlf , and do detailed statistics on quasar properties based on a complete sample of sdss@xmath25_wise _ selected @xmath168 quasars@xcite .",
    "more detailed analysis of the completeness of our quasar sample will be discussed in the qlf paper .",
    "although allwise has whole - sky coverage , sdss is limited to only one quarter of the sky .",
    "new optical sky surveys are providing coverage of the entire high galactic latitude sky : the pan - starrs-1 survey @xcite has a much larger sky coverage and a slightly deeper depth in red filters than sdss and it has a @xmath169-band filter that covers the @xmath170 range , allowing quasar selection to @xmath171 . combining pan - starrs with allwise photometry will provide a much more comprehensive way to find luminous high - redshift quasars .",
    "many other ongoing large - area optical sky surveys including skymapper , vst atlas , decals , bass , and des will enable a complete all - sky survey of luminous high - redshift quasars by combining them with the allwise photometry .",

    "<S> high - redshift quasars are important tracers of structure and evolution in the early universe . however , they are very rare and difficult to find when using color selection because of contamination from late - type dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> high - redshift quasar surveys based on only optical colors suffer from incompleteness and low identification efficiency , especially at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we have developed a new method to select @xmath1 quasars with both high efficiency and completeness by combining optical and mid - ir _ wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) _ photometric data , and are conducting a luminous @xmath2 quasar survey in the whole sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) footprint . </S>",
    "<S> we have spectroscopically observed 99 out of 110 candidates with @xmath3-band magnitudes brighter than 19.5 and 64 ( 64.6% ) of them are quasars with redshifts of @xmath4 and absolute magnitudes of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we also observed 14 fainter candidates selected with the same criteria and identified 8 ( 57.1% ) of them as quasars with @xmath6 . among 72 newly identified quasars , </S>",
    "<S> 12 of them are at @xmath7 , which leads to an increase of @xmath836% of the number of known quasars at this redshift range . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , our identifications doubled the number of quasars with @xmath9 at @xmath10 , which will set strong constraints on the bright end of the quasar luminosity function . </S>",
    "<S> we also expand our method to select quasars at @xmath11 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we report the discovery of four new luminous @xmath11 quasars based on sdss-_wise _ selection . </S>"
