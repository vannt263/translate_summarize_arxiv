    "where all non - sm fields other than the two lightest inert neutralinos are heavy ( @xmath117 ) the lightest inert neutralino state in the e@xmath0ssm results in too large density of dark matter .",

    "a reasonable density of dark matter can be obtained for @xmath122 when the lightest inert neutralino states annihilate mainly through an @xmath48channel @xmath2boson , via its inert higgsino doublet components which couple to the @xmath2boson .",
    "it is worth noting that if @xmath118 was pure inert higgsino then the @xmath48channel @xmath2boson annihilation would proceed with the full gauge coupling strength leaving the relic density too low to account for the observed dark matter . in the e@xmath0ssm",

    "this happens when @xmath118 annihilation proceeds through the @xmath2boson resonance , i.e. @xmath124 .",
    "because the scenarios that result in the reasonable density of dark matter imply that @xmath97 and @xmath98 have large couplings to the lightest higgs boson which are much larger than the @xmath125quark yukawa coupling and the decays of the lightest higgs state into these inert neutralinos are kinematically allowed , the sm  like higgs boson decays predominantly into @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
