    "a promising approach to quantum gravity is the asymptotic safety scenario , first proposed by weinberg @xcite , which aims to describe quantum gravity within the framework of quantum field theory .",
    "as is well known , the quantum field theory of gravity based on the einstein ",
    "hilbert action is perturbatively non  renormalizable @xcite ; the asymptotic safety scenario suggests instead that the theory is non ",
    "perturbatively renormalizable at a non  gaussian ultraviolet ( uv ) fixed  point of the renormalization group ( rg ) flow .",
    "to inquire if a theory is renormalizable in a non  perturbative way one needs non - perturbative tools .",
    "one of these tools is the exact functional rg equation satisfied by the ( background ) effective average action ( eaa ) , first derived in the context of quantum gravity by reuter @xcite .",
    "so far , various applications of the eaa formalism to the problem of quantum gravity @xcite have supported the asymptotic safety scenario .",
    "evidence has been found for the existence of a non  gaussian fixed ",
    "point with a finite dimensional uv",
    " critical surface @xcite .",
    "all previous applications of the eaa formalism to quantum gravity were based on the specific closure of the beta functions first proposed in @xcite ; in this letter we will propose a more consistent approach that accounts for the non  trivial influence that the anomalous dimensions of the fluctuating metric and ghost fields have on the rg flow of the cosmological and newton s constants .",
    "our results show that even in this enlarged framework , these two couplings are characterized by a non  gaussian fixed point , thus attesting the robustness of asymptotic safety to this generalization .",
    "the application of functional renormalization group techniques to theories characterized by local symmetries requires overcoming the problem of performing the coarse  graining procedure in a covariant way . a solution to this problem comes from the combination of the eaa and the background field formalisms @xcite .",
    "the preservation of gauge invariance along the flow comes at the cost of enlarging theory space to include invariants constructed with both background and fluctuating fields .",
    "this defines the background eaa , which becomes a functional of these two fields invariant under physical and background gauge transformations . in the case of gravity ,",
    "the metric @xmath0 is split into a background @xmath1 and a fluctuation @xmath2 in the following way : @xmath3 we have re  scaled the fluctuating metric so that the combination @xmath4 acts as the gravitational coupling , @xmath5 being the scale dependent newton s constant ( see eq .",
    "( [ gravity_q_2 ] ) in the next section ) . in this way a gravitational vertex with @xmath6legs",
    "is accompanied by a factor @xmath7 . in the construction of",
    "the background eaa one introduces , in the path integral , source , gauge  fixing and cutoff terms ; in these the background and fluctuating metric do not appear via their sum @xmath0 . as a consequence",
    ", the rg flow generates invariants which depend on @xmath1 and @xmath2 separately . in this formalism , only couplings of invariants which are functionals of @xmath0 alone are interpreted as physical , while the couplings of the other invariants are seen as unphysical , even if their influence on the flow of physical couplings is non  trivial .",
    "the study of this influence is the main goal of this letter .",
    "the background eaa for gravity splits as follows : @xmath8=\\bar{\\gamma}_{k}[\\bar{g}+h]+\\hat{\\gamma}_{k}[\\varphi;\\bar{g}]\\ , ,     \\label{eaa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the fluctuating multiplet comprising the fluctuating metric and the ghost fields . in ( [ eaa ] ) we defined the gauge invariant eaa @xmath10 $ ] and the remainder eaa @xmath11 $ ] . for consistency we must have @xmath10\\equiv\\gamma_{k}[0;\\bar{g}]$ ] and @xmath11=0 $ ] , with the first invariant under physical diffeomorphisms and the second invariant under combined physical and background diffeomorphisms .",
    "the main virtue of the background eaa for gravity is that it satisfies an exact equation @xcite : @xmath12=\\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{tr}\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{(2;0)}[\\varphi;\\bar{g}]+r_{k}[\\bar{g}]\\right)^{-1}\\,\\partial_{t}r_{k}[\\bar{g}]\\ , ,    \\label{erge}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which defines a mathematically consistent rg flow , i.e. uv and ir finite , despite the theory being perturbatively non  renormalizable : this is the non - perturbative tool that is used to inquire if gravity is asymptotically safe .",
    "it is important to note that the rg flow described by ( [ erge ] ) is driven by the hessian of the background eaa taken with respect to the fluctuating multiplet @xmath13 , thus the rg flow equation for @xmath10 $ ] , resulting from setting @xmath14 in ( [ erge ] ) , is _ not closed _ since its rhs depends also on @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "this fact forces us to consider the flow of the full @xmath16 $ ] instead of only that of @xmath10 $ ] , which we would like to consider the physically interesting one .",
    "it is thus of fundamental importance to develop a systematic way to treat truncations of the full background eaa depending on both background and fluctuating fields , in order to consistently close the rg flow of the gauge invariant part of the eaa . in this letter",
    "we will apply to the einstein ",
    "hilbert truncation the technique developed in @xcite for this purpose .",
    "we will show how the rg flow of the cosmological and newton s constants can be consistently closed by independently evaluating the anomalous dimensions of the fluctuating metric and ghost fields .",
    "in actual applications one typically makes an ansatz for the background eaa @xmath17 $ ] ; this means that theory space is truncated to some chosen functional and one hopes that this subspace is complete enough to describe the flow in an approximate , but yet non - perturbative , way .",
    "our truncation ansatz for the gauge invariant part of the eaa will be the rg improved version of the einstein ",
    "hilbert action , where both the cosmological and newton s constants become scale dependent quantities : @xmath18=\\frac{1}{16\\pi g_{k}}\\int d^{d}x\\sqrt{g}\\left(2\\lambda_{k}-r\\right)\\ , .",
    "\\label{gravity_q_2}\\ ] ] quantum fluctuations are responsible for the anomalous scaling of the fields ; this fact is accounted for by introducing scale dependent wave  function renormalization constants for all the fluctuating fields present in the theory ; in our case we redefine the fluctuating metric and the ghost fields according to : @xmath19 the scale derivative of the logarithm of the wave  function renormalization constants defines the relative anomalous dimensions : @xmath20 next , we need to make an ansatz for the remainder functional @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "we will consider the simplest non  trivial case comprised by the classical background gauge  fixing and ghost actions ( these can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "we work with the gauge condition @xmath22 .",
    "there are different possible cutoff choices which can be thought of as the freedom we have in setting up our coarse  graining procedure . in the nomenclature of @xcite",
    ", we will present the results for the type ia cutoff in order to compare to previous findings @xcite .",
    "the type ia cutoff is characterized by having as cutoff operators the covariant laplacians in both the gravitational and ghost sectors .",
    "to obtain the beta functions of the physical couplings one computes the hessian of the background eaa with respect to the fluctuating fields @xmath13 , inserts it into the rhs of the rg flow equation ( [ erge ] ) and then sets @xmath14 .",
    "the trace on the rhs of ( [ erge ] ) can then be expanded in terms of invariants of the background metric using heat kernel techniques in a standard way @xcite .    after introducing dimensionless cosmological and newton s constants , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ,",
    "one finds the following general form for the beta functions : @xmath25\\tilde{g}_{k}\\nonumber\\\\ \\partial_{t}\\tilde{g}_{k}=(d-2)\\tilde{g}_{k}\\nonumber\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\,\\\\ + \\left[b_{d}(\\tilde{\\lambda}_k)+d_{d}(\\tilde{\\lambda}_k)\\,\\eta_{h , k}+f_{d}(\\tilde{\\lambda}_k)\\,\\eta_{c , k}\\right]\\tilde{g}_{k}^{2}\\ , , \\label{bf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 are functions of the dimensionless cosmological constant @xmath27 and their specific form depends on both the cutoff type and cutoff shape function ( i.e. the smearing function in the cutoff action that dictates how slow modes are suppressed ) .",
    "the explicit form of the functions @xmath28 can be found in @xcite , while the functions @xmath29 can be extracted from @xcite .",
    "the beta functions ( [ bf ] ) constitute the basis of the eaa approach to quantum gravity and were first derived in @xcite .",
    "note that they are valid for @xmath30 .",
    "the beta functions ( [ bf ] ) for the physical couplings @xmath31 and @xmath32 do not form a closed system of odes because of the presence , on the rhs , of the anomalous dimensions @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this reflects the fact , noticed previously , that the rg flow equation for @xmath10 $ ] is not closed , but depends also on @xmath15 $ ] , and this forces us to consider the flow of the full background eaa to find a consistent closure for these beta functions . before presenting our solution to this problem",
    ", we will review the approaches available in the literature .",
    ".fixed  points and critical exponents for the various closures of the beta functions of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , in @xmath35 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the first way in which one can close the beta functions ( [ bf ] ) is the trivial one where one sets @xmath36 .",
    "this amounts to a one  loop approximation . within this approximation only the first terms inside the parenthesis of ( [ bf ] ) are retained @xcite : @xmath37 a similar one ",
    "loop flow is generated by matter interactions and becomes physically significant when the number of matter fields is large @xcite . in two dimensions",
    "the beta function for newton s constant is universal and one indeed finds @xmath38 for any cutoff specification @xcite .    the second closure method is the rg improvement adopted in most previous studies @xcite . the system ( [ bf ] )",
    "is closed by imposing the following relations : @xmath39 the identification in ( [ std ] ) implies a non  trivial , but difficult to interpret , rg improvement of the beta functions . we will call this procedure the _ standard _ rg improvement of the beta functions ( [ bf ] ) .",
    "note also that in this way we are imposing @xmath40 at any non - gaussian fixed ",
    "point @xcite .",
    "the beta functions obtained in this way are exactly those first obtained in @xcite .",
    "inserting ( [ std ] ) in ( [ bf ] ) and solving for @xmath41 gives : @xmath42 note that these are rational functions of both @xmath43 and @xmath44 ; this can be interpreted as a re - summation of an infinite number of perturbative diagrams implemented by the rg improvement implied by ( [ std ] ) . in @xmath35 ,",
    "the beta functions ( [ bfstd ] ) have a non  gaussian fixed  point for the values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 reported in table 1 . the non  gaussian fixed ",
    "point is uv attractive in both directions ; thus , within this truncation , quantum gravity is asymptotically safe .",
    "the stability matrix has a pair of complex conjugated critical exponents with negative real part .",
    "these are also reported in table 1 . here",
    "we follow the convention of @xcite that a negative value for the critical exponent implies that the relative eigendirection is uv attractive . for more details on this point",
    "see @xcite . to guarantee predictivity we still need to show that the uv critical surface is finite dimensional ; to do this we need to enlarge our truncation and see if we find operators with repulsive uv directions at the non  gaussian fixed  point .",
    "evidence for the existence of such operators has been found , within truncations closed using ( [ std ] ) , in @xcite .",
    "the third way to close the beta functions system ( [ bf ] ) is to separately calculate the anomalous dimensions of the fluctuating metric and ghost fields that enter it .",
    "these can be determined as functions of @xmath44 and @xmath43 that can successively be reinserted in the beta functions . in doing",
    "so we make a step further in considering the flow in the enlarged theory space where the background eaa lives .",
    "as we said , we are adopting the point of view that @xmath31 and @xmath32 are physical couplings while @xmath47 and @xmath48 are not , but the influence of these last couplings is non  trivial and it is important to account for it .",
    "this line of reasoning has partially been implemented in @xcite where the closure ( [ std ] ) was extended by separately calculating the ghost anomalous dimension in place of setting it to zero .",
    "the flow so obtained is similar to the standard one ; in particular , it is still strongly spiraling around the non  gaussian fixed  point .",
    "the authors of @xcite used a generalized heat kernel technique @xcite to determine the anomalous dimension of the ghost fields ; since they use a type ia cutoff we can compare their results directly with ours .",
    " trivial truncation of the ghost sector has been considered in @xcite .",
    "our calculations of the anomalous dimensions @xmath33 and @xmath34 have been performed using the diagrammatic techniques presented in @xcite , where one uses the flow equations for the zero  field proper ",
    "vertices @xmath49 $ ] of the background eaa to extract the running of the couplings .",
    "these flow equations are represented diagrammatically in figure 1 .",
    "the full technical details of our computation will be presented elsewhere @xcite .    both @xmath33 and @xmath34 turn out not to depend on the cutoff operator type ( i.e. on the cutoff operator used to separate fast from slow field modes ) and have the following general form : @xmath50\\tilde{g}_{k}\\qquad\\quad\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\eta_{c , k } = \\left[b_{d}(\\tilde{\\lambda}_k)+d_{d}(\\tilde{\\lambda}_k)\\,\\eta_{h , k}+f_{d}(\\tilde{\\lambda}_k)\\,\\eta_{c , k}\\right]\\tilde{g}_{k}\\,,\\quad\\label{etas}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 are functions of the dimensionless cosmological constant .",
    "their explicit form is long and will be given in @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ etas ] ) constitutes a linear system for @xmath33 and @xmath34 that can be solved to yield the anomalous dimensions as functions solely of the physical couplings @xmath44 and @xmath43 .",
    "the anomalous dimensions ( [ etas ] ) depend on the ( possibly scale dependent ) gauge  fixing parameters that here we set to @xmath22 .",
