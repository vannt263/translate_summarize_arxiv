    "though the present day universe is well described by an isotropic and homogeneous friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) model , there are serious theoretical arguments about the existence of an anisotropic phase in the evolution of the universe @xcite .",
    "these ideas were further supported by the observational data from cobe ( cosmic background explorer ) and wmap ( the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ) where small anisotropy in the microwave background radiation was found .",
    "these lead many cosmologists to consider the anisotropic model to describe the initial phase of the evolution which eventually decays into an isotropic frw one .    after the famous paper by a. guth @xcite , scalar field",
    "was hugely used in simulating different cosmological models .",
    "but the question occurs , if other fields can contribute to the evolution of the universe . as an alternative",
    "the spinor field was used due to its sensitivity to the gravitational one @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear spinor field proved to be able to describe different cosmological models .",
    "for example it was shown that a suitable choice of nonlinearity ( i ) accelerates the isotropization process , ( ii ) gives rise to a singularity - free universe and ( iii ) generates late time acceleration .",
    "moreover , it is shown that a nonlinear spinor field can be used to simulate a perfect fluid from ekpyrotic matter to phantom matter @xcite .    at the same time",
    "the string cosmological models have been used in attempts to describe the early universe and to investigate anisotropic dark energy component including a coupling between dark energy and a perfect fluid ( dark matter ) @xcite .",
    "cosmic strings are one dimensional topological defects associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking in gauge theories .",
    "their presence in the early universe can be justified in the frame of grand unified theories ( gut ) .    on the other hand",
    ", the magnetic field has an important role at the cosmological scale and is present in galactic and intergalactic spaces .",
    "any theoretical study of cosmological models which contain a magnetic field must take into account that the corresponding universes are necessarily anisotropic . among the anisotropic spacetimes ,",
    "bianchi type - i space ( bi ) seems to be the most convenient for testing different cosmological models .",
    "the object of this paper is to investigate a bi string cosmological model in the presence of a magnetic flux . for this purpose",
    "we use the nonlinear spinor field simulation as was described recently in a number of papers @xcite .",
    "we study the evolution of the universe in presence of a cosmic string and a magnetic flux in the framework of a bi anisotropic cosmological model . for a bi spacetime",
    "the line element is given by @xmath0 there are three scale factors @xmath1 @xmath2 which are functions of time @xmath3 only and consequently three expansion rates . in principle",
    "all these scale factors could be different and it is useful to express the mean expansion rate in terms of the average hubble rate : @xmath4 where over - dot means differentiation with respect to @xmath3 .    einstein s gravitational field equations , corresponding to the metric have the form    [ bid ] @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the energy momentum tensor for a system of cosmic string and magnetic field in a comoving coordinate is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the rest energy density of strings with massive particles attached to them and can be expressed as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the rest energy density of the particles attached to the strings and @xmath11 is the tension density of the system of strings @xcite which may be positive or negative . here @xmath12 is the four velocity and @xmath13 is the direction of the string , obeying the relations @xmath14    in @xmath15 is the electromagnetic field @xcite and in what follows we shall choose the string and also the magnetic field along @xmath16 direction . in our model the electromagnetic field tensor @xmath17 has only one non - vanishing component , namely @xmath18 where @xmath19 is presumed to be constant . for the electromagnetic field @xmath20 one",
    "gets the following non - trivial components @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a constant characteristic of the medium and called the magnetic permeability .",
    "typically @xmath22 differs from unity only by a few parts in @xmath23 ( @xmath24 for paramagnetic substances and @xmath25 for diamagnetic ) . to simplify the notation",
    ", we include in a constant @xmath26 the value of the electromagnetic field , @xmath19 , and the magnetic permeability , @xmath22 .",
    "using comoving coordinates we have the following components of energy momentum tensor @xcite : @xmath27 where we introduce the volume scale of the bi space - time @xcite @xmath28 which is connected with the hubble rate , namely @xmath29    in view of @xmath30 from one finds @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 some integration constants .    on the other hand , summation of einstein equations , , and three times gives : @xmath34    taking into account the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor , i.e. , @xmath35 , after a little manipulation of one obtains @xcite : @xmath36    it is customary to assume a relation between @xmath8 and @xmath11 in accordance with the state equations for strings .",
    "the simplest one is a proportionality relation @xcite : @xmath37 among the most usual choices of the constant @xmath38 we mention the following : @xmath39    it is possible to consider a more general barotropic relation @xmath40 than the linear relation , subject to the restrictions imposed by the energy conditions .",
    "the weak energy condition as well as the strong one require @xmath41 with @xmath42 or @xmath43 with @xmath44 and the dominant energy condition implies @xmath43 and @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "recently it was shown that a nonlinear spinor can be used to simulate different types of perfect fluids including those called ekpyrotic , phantom matter and dark energy @xcite . here",
    "we show that it is possible to describe cosmic strings in terms of spinor fields as well .",
    "we shall simulate the cloud formed by massive cosmic strings with particles attached along their extensions with a nonlinear spinor field described by the lagrangian : @xmath46 - m{\\bar \\psi}\\psi + f\\ , , \\label{lspin}\\ ] ] with @xmath47 being some arbitrary function of the scalar @xmath48 . for the simulation of the present cosmological model",
    "in which the anisotropic scale factors @xmath1 are functions solely of time it is adequate to assume that the spinor field depends on @xmath3 only .",
    "then the corresponding components of energy - momentum tensor take the form    @xmath49    in what follows we describe the energy density @xmath8 of the string by @xmath50 and the tension density @xmath11 by @xmath51 in agreement with . inserting and into",
    "we find @xmath52 with the solution @xmath53 here @xmath54 is an integration constant .",
    "the positivity of @xmath55 imposes some restriction on @xmath54 , namely @xmath56 . setting @xmath57 we find the cosmic string",
    "can be described by the spinor field lagrangian @xmath58 - \\nu s^{(\\alpha - 1)/\\alpha}\\ , , \\label{lspincs}\\ ] ] remarking the disappearance of the mass term @xcite .    with these preparatives",
    "we get    @xmath59    variation on with respect to @xmath60 and @xmath61 gives spinor field equations with nonlinear terms . on the other hand from the spinor field equations for @xmath62",
    "one finds @xcite @xmath63 with the solution @xmath64 @xmath65 being a constant .",
    "taking into account this simple behavior of @xmath62 we have finally    @xmath66    with the constant @xmath67 .    using the above formulas for",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath11 , from we can determine the anisotropic factor @xmath68 : @xmath69 @xmath70 being a constant of integration .",
    "on the other hand , from equations and we obtain @xmath71 and @xmath72      in what follows , we study the equation for @xmath73 in details . using the above expressions for @xmath74 we get from :",
    "@xmath75 we can evaluate the derivative of @xmath73 with respect to @xmath3 which leads finally to a solution in quadrature @xmath76\\tau^{(\\alpha + 1)/\\alpha } + [ \\kappa \\beta^2 a_1 ^ 2/2 ]   \\tau^2 + c } } = t + t_0\\ , , \\label{1st}\\ ] ] @xmath77 and @xmath78 being some integration constants .    in spite of the fact that this equation can not be explicitly solved , the asymptotic behavior of the solutions for @xmath79 could be found .      in most cases , provides a standing expansion of the volume scale of the bi spacetime for @xmath3 growing .",
    "indeed , for @xmath80 i.e. @xmath81 or @xmath82 , the term with @xmath83 at the denominator of the l. h. s. of is dominant and we get an exponential behavior @xmath84 for large @xmath3 . in this case , only the anisotropic factor @xmath68 presents an exponential increase for @xmath85 , while the scale factors @xmath86 and @xmath87 tend to constants .",
    "concerning the asymptotic behavior of @xmath8 and @xmath11 we infer from , that they tend to zero as @xmath88      for @xmath89 , there is no solution with a @xmath90 behavior for @xmath85 . in this case from one finds : @xmath91    since @xmath92 , @xmath73 can not tend to infinity as @xmath93 .",
    "therefore the model does not admit a consistent solution for @xmath89 in agreement with the discussion of the general barotropic equation from section [ basic ] .",
    "taking into account the absence of consistent solutions for @xmath89 as it was shown above , for the present spinor simulation , in what follows we shall refer only to the situations described in subsection [ casei ] ( case i ) .",
    "it is worth also mentioning that the present model does not support in any case a vanishing of @xmath73 for @xmath85 .      in this subsection",
    "we graphically illustrate the evolution of energy density @xmath8 , volume scale @xmath73 and metric functions @xmath68 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in doing",
    "so we rewrite the equation for @xmath73 in terms of the hubble parameter @xmath94 and introduce a new function @xmath95 :    [ system ] @xmath96    we also rewrite the metric functions in terms of @xmath95 , which now read @xmath97    let us now numerically solve the system . in doing so for simplicity",
    "we set @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 . in fig .",
    "[ rhosppf0 ] we plot the evolution of energy density @xmath8 for different values of @xmath38 , namely for @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "evolution of @xmath73 corresponding to these values of parameters in shown in fig .",
    "[ tausppf ] .",
    "for simplicity we also set the initial values of @xmath73 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 to be unity .",
    "the numerical simulations support the behavior described in , . from fig .",
    "[ tausppf ] one finds at first , in the case of a negative @xmath38 the universe expands slower than it does as for a positive @xmath38 , though in both cases we have an exponential growth for large time .    in figs .",
    "[ abc+105 ] and [ abc-1 ] we plot the behavior of metric functions for positive and negative values of @xmath38 . as is seen from the figures , with the expansion of the universe @xmath68 increases exponentially , while @xmath104 tend to constants .",
    "thus we see that introduction of cosmic string does not allow isotropization of initially anisotropic space - time . in the following subsections",
    "we discuss the singularity problem and isotropization process in detail .",
    "the next task is to investigate the space - time singularities in the present model .",
    "let us rewrite the metric functions in the following form : @xmath105 where @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109,@xmath110,@xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 .",
    "then the first and the second derivatives of the metric functions take the form :    [ singvis ] @xmath114    we study the singularities analyzing the regularity properties of the kretschmann scalar which for the metric reads @xmath115\\ , .",
    "\\label{kretsch}\\ ] ] evidently , a singularity can occur when some or all scale factors @xmath1 tend to zero or infinity .",
    "we shall follow the criteria given in @xcite which states :    \\(i ) @xmath3 finite , some @xmath116 . _",
    "if at least one scale factor becomes infinite at finite @xmath3 , it is a curvature singularity . _",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath3 finite , some @xmath117 . _",
    "if more than one scale factor turns to zero at finite @xmath3 , it is a singularity .",

    "> 0.$ ]    looking at the asymptotic behaviors described above ( section [ asymptotic ] ) we conclude that in the spinor field approach of the cosmic strings the present model is nonsingular at the end of the evolution .",
    "no scale factor of the bi metric presents a growth faster than exponentially or vanishing faster than exponentially for @xmath93 .",
    "since the present - day universe is surprisingly isotropic , it is important to see whether our anisotropic bi model evolves into an isotropic frw model .",
    "isotropization means that at large physical times @xmath3 , when the volume factor @xmath73 tends to infinity , the three scale factors @xmath120 grow at the same rate .",
    "two wide - spread criteria of isotropization read    [ aniso ] @xmath121    here @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the average anisotropy and shear , respectively , while @xmath124 is the directional hubble parameter evaluated in .",
    "we also investigate the isotropization condition proposed in @xcite @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the average scale factor . provided that condition",
    "is fulfilled , by rescaling some of the coordinates , we can make @xmath127 , and the metric will become manifestly isotropic at large @xmath3 .    in order to study the isotropization process in the present model , we evaluate from @xmath128 taking into account the value of @xmath129 and @xmath130 we see that @xmath131 do not tend to constants as @xmath93 .",
    "for example , in the generic case with the exponential expansion of the volume of the universe , @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "so in the case considered , no isotropization process takes place . indeed , at the early stage of evolution , where @xmath135",
    "we assume @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , that is at this stage the universe looks like a one - dimensional string . in the asymptotic region where @xmath139 and @xmath140 we have @xmath136 , while @xmath86 and @xmath87 evaluating to finite values .",
    "let us also examine the possibility of an isotropization process using conditions .",
    "in view of from in the generic case one finds :    [ aniso1 ] @xmath141    as one sees , both @xmath122 and @xmath123 are some positive defined , non vanishing quantities .",
    "thus , in general , the present model does not undergo an isotropization process , the anisotropic feature of the universe from the early stages being retained .",
    "we have studied the evolution of a anisotropic universe given by a bi cosmological model in presence of cosmic strings and magnetic field . in doing",
    "so we exploit the spinor simulation of cosmic strings that allows us to solve the system of einstein s equations .",
    "exact solutions have been supplemented with some numerical evaluations .",
    "it is shown that the presence of cosmic strings does not allow the anisotropic universe to evolve into an isotropic one .",
