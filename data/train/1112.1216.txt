    "the interest in the consequences of defects in graphene has been mushrooming .",
    "@xcite graphene s linear density of states imparts unusual properties to the behavior of its defects which in turn generates unusual physical properties for the graphene sheets .",
    "the interest is especially high in controlling these defect - induced properties , particularly for those cases where the adatom develops a magnetic moment .",
    "usually vacancies or magnetic adatoms in graphene are individually studied , and they have been found to exhibit unusual properties .",
    "for example , a vacancy leads to the formation of a sharp doubly degenerate localized state sitting at the junction of the upper and lower bands .",
    "this localized state is quite robust to the addition of many vacancies . in a nearest - neighbor , tight - binging particle - hole symmetric model of graphene ,",
    "the amplitude of the resonant state wavefunction is zero on all lattices sites that are on the same sublattice of the vacancy .",
    "@xcite    a magnetic adatom on graphene behaves quite differently from the classic anderson impurity physics coupling to a constant density of states .",
    "generally , with a linear density of states , a kondo effect does not occur , @xcite and such observables as magnetic susceptibilities and spectral densities differ markedly from mean - field and constant density of state renormalization group theories . as a function of model parameters , the adatom magnetic",
    "moment in graphene can cross - over from having free moment curie - like temperature dependence to having a paramagnetic - like temperature independent one .",
    "the spectral densities lack a central peak .",
    "instead , they have two peaks , one in the upper band and one in the lower , separated by roughly @xmath0 , the coulomb interaction associated with the impurity orbital.@xcite    in this work , we report the consequences of an adjacent vacancy - adatom pair .",
    "we find that when paired these defects exhibit new unusual features that differ from either the single - vacancy or the single - adatom case .",
    "for example , the robust central resonance of the single vacancy problem disappears , even in the particle - hole symmetric case .",
    "the upper and lower peaks of the single adatom problem are each split with the two outer peaks of the now four separated by roughly @xmath0 , and the positions of the inner two have only a weak dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "these peaks are the doubly degenerate localized vacancy states shifted to the upper and lower bands by the presence of the adatom .",
    "the significance of this split is that by changing the chemical potential of this two - defect system , we can turn the adatom magnetic moment on and off by varying it over a energy range set by the localized vacancy state instead of a range set by the location of the adatom impurity orbital .",
    "we also find that the two - defect wavefunction has a small amplitude on sublattice sites the same as that of the vacancy , just as in the case of a single vacancy .",
    "our starting point is the anderson impurity model which has a single impurity orbital of energy @xmath1 and coulomb repulsion @xmath0 inhibiting its occupancy by two electrons .",
    "@xcite the impurity orbital is coupled to a free - electron conduction band with hybridization of strength @xmath2 .",
    "the total hamiltonian is @xmath3 as standard , @xmath4 is a tight - binding hamiltonian which for graphene is @xmath5-\\mu\\sum_{<ij>,\\sigma}[a^{\\dag}_{i\\sigma}a_{i\\sigma}^{}+b^{\\dag}_{i\\sigma}b_{i\\sigma}^{}]\\texttt{,}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 and @xmath7 create an electron with spin @xmath8 at sites @xmath9 and @xmath10 on the @xmath11 and @xmath12 sub - lattices of graphene s hexagonal structure . in graphene",

    "finally , @xmath18 describes the hybridization between the adatom impurity and one of graphene s carbon atoms . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : struc ] , the tight - binding portion of the hamiltonian is perturbed by creating a vacancy at site @xmath19 . in what follows we place the adatom either on the opposite sublattice at @xmath20 or on the same sublattice at @xmath21 . for an adatom on site @xmath20 , @xmath22\\texttt{.}\\ ] ]    our principal computational tool is the single - impurity quantum monte carlo ( hirsch - fye ) algorithm for computing the thermodynamic properties of the adatom , and the method of bayesian statistical inference for computing its spectral density .",
    "the hirsch - fye algorithm @xcite naturally returns the imaginary - time green s function @xmath23 of the impurity . with this green s function",
    ", we can easily compute for the adatom orbital such basic quantities as the expected values of the total charge @xmath24 , the square of the spin @xmath25 , and the doubly occupancy @xmath26 .",
    "we note that @xmath27 a non - zero value of @xmath25 indicates the formation of a moment on the adatom orbital .",
    "the closer this value is to one the more fully developed is the moment .",
    "we also calculate the static adatom spin susceptibility @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "computing the imaginary - time green s function also enables us to compute the spectral density @xmath31 by numerically solving @xcite @xmath32 the detailed procedure for doing this is presented in ref .  .",
    "this bayesian inference procedure is colloquially , but imprecisely , also called the maximum entropy method .    invoking the bipartite nature of the lattice , which remains true even with the vacancy and adatom , and using the standard particle - hole transformation on one - sublattice",
    ", we can prove that when @xmath33 , @xmath34 and consequently that @xmath35 .",
    "these two results in turn imply symmetries with respect the sign of @xmath14 in the various thermodynamic quantities of interest .",
    "these symmetries also mean that without loss of generality we can restrict our attention to the behavior of the system when @xmath36 .",
    "we calibrated our quantum monte carlo results by performing exact diagonalization studies @xcite of an 11-site graphene structure with a vacancy and adatom .",
    "this system is half - filled when there are 12 electrons .",
    "we started with this filling and then systematically removed electrons , keeping the number of up and down electrons equal when their total number @xmath37 was even or having one more up than down if their total number was odd .",
    "for the same system , we also performed quantum monte carlo calculations and found excellent agreement in the computed thermodynamic quantities and correlation functions .",
    "we comment that the exact diagonalization calculation is at zero temperature and in the canonical ensemble .",
    "the quantum monte carlo simulation is at a finite temperature and in the grand canonical ensemble . to compare quantum monte carlo with exact diagonalization , we did the simulation at a very low temperature ( @xmath38 ) and adjusted the chemical potential so that the average number of electrons closely matched that of the zero temperature system .",

    "we comment that if were to place the adatom at @xmath21 , we would find much smaller enhancements if any occur .",
    "we recall that in the absence of an adatom the wave - function of the localized vacancy state is non - zero at @xmath20 but zero at @xmath21 .",

    "the dashed lines mark the location of the chemical potential : @xmath56 . in all sub - figures @xmath41 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "we clearly see the four - peak structure noted earlier plus the breakdown of particle - hole symmetry as soon as @xmath14 is slightly shifted from zero .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec]d - f for @xmath47 complements the @xmath45 case . in both cases ,",
    "as we lower @xmath14 the former localized vacancy state peaks are first pushed away from @xmath59 and then are drawn back .",
    "consequently , the dynamics of the local moment is initially controlled by the localized vacancy state and then by the adatom impurity state .",
    "we note that when @xmath14 is far from zero , the larger @xmath2 results give a wider width to @xmath60 peaks associated with the impurity state .",
    "this is not unexpected , but we also note that our procedure for determining the spectral density tends to broaden high frequency features .",
    "@xcite    in fig .",

    "@xcite we change the coulomb interaction strength in the range ( 0.8t,3 t ) , which overlaps the above ranges .",
    "we see that when u is increased , the outer two peaks become farther from each other while the two inner become closer , and we also note that these changes are small in this range .",
    "we expect that the two inner peaks will continue to move toward each other when u is increased .",
    "we comment that the strong central peak characteristic of a vacancy in graphene is absent when the adatom is present .",
    "in fact it becomes absent as soon as particle - hole symmetry is absent .",
    "the inner peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] are these @xmath44 localized states shifted by the symmetry breaking and the presence of the adatom . with exact diagonalization",

    "@xmath41 , @xmath45 @xmath51 and @xmath43 .",
    "the insets show the tails of @xmath62 and @xmath61 . ]",
    "the expected physics of the single impurity anderson model in the absence of a vacancy and the kondo effect is a double peak structure in @xmath60 where the lower frequency peak is associated with a singly occupied state and the upper peak with an excitation to a doubly occupied state .",
    "the single electron in this impurity state is anti - ferromagnetically correlated with the conduction band electrons and fluctuates in its spin polarization so that @xmath63 .",
    "fluctuations in charge are relatively weaker .",
    "an extension of the hirsh - fye algorithm @xcite makes the computation of the the spin - spin @xmath61 and charge - charge @xmath62 correlations between the adatom and conduction electrons possible .",
    "we show typical results in fig .",
    "[ fig : corfunc ] .",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath65 are the on - site correlation functions for an adatom at @xmath20 .",
    "the locations with even index are positions on the same sublattice as @xmath20 and those with an odd index are positions on the opposite sublattice .",
    "we see that both the spin - spin @xmath61 and charge - charge correlations @xmath62 are relatively short - ranged .",
    "the plots of @xmath61 show that the adatom spin is always ferromagnetically coupled with the conduction electron spin at neighboring sites .",
    "for the single adatom case , this correlation shifts from ferromagnetic to anti - ferromagnetic as we shift @xmath14 below zero .",
    "in addition , the correlations are longer - ranged and less damped .",
    "we also note that @xmath61 as a function of displacement from the vacancy quickly becomes anti - ferromagnetic when the adatom spin and conduction electron spins are on the same sublattice but represents uncorrelated spins if they are on opposite sublattices . presumably , as for the single vacancy case , the two - defect wavefunction is very small at the sites in the second case and larger at the sites in the first case .",
    "we further note that as we lower @xmath14 the spin correlations become monotonically suppressed , even though over the range of the shift where we are increasing and then decreasing the adatom moment ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nomk ] ) .",
    "this suppression is the opposite of the enhancement we observed for the single adatom case .",
    "@xcite    the charge - charge correlation function @xmath62 is larger if the adatom and conduction electron charges are on the same sublattice .",
    "when we shift @xmath14 below zero , its amplitude on these sites also decreases . when we shift @xmath14 , the occupancy of the impurity orbital and conduction band shift from half filling so their charge exchange ( the possibility of hopping ) enhances , and the expected value of the charge decreases ( fig .  [",
    "fig : nomk]),which in turn decreases the size of the correlations .",
    "this behavior is also opposite of what we observed for the single adatom case .",
    "we expect the strong features in @xmath60 to appear in the system s density of states .",
    "accordingly , the position of the chemical potential relative to the position of the peaks in @xmath60 can influence the physics of the adatom . when the chemical potential is near or at the location of the shifted localized vacancy state , the physics is that of a localized state . when away , the physics changes .",
    "our results are consistent with this expectation .",
    "our findings are a result of the impurity orbital now sharing its electrons between two states with two different energies instead of its electrons being associated with a single energy state .",
    "still , these states must share a total charge of one or less , depending on the chemical potential , and both must respect the energy penalty for double occupancy . in turn , these two states hybridize with each other through their hybridization with the conduction electrons and exchange electrons . as we lower the chemical potential and",
    "begin to deplete the electron occupancy in the upper localized state , at the same time reducing the double occupancy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nomk ] ) , we can increase the fluctuations of net non - zero spin and hence increase @xmath25 .",
    "when we leave the localized state behind , we are left with just the impurity state , which now has fewer remaining electrons and strongly suppressed spin and charge fluctuations . in general , as a function of the chemical potential , the presence of the vacancy causes the adatom impurity to behave differently , and in the case of its spin and charge correlations with the conduction electrons , for example , the behavior trends as a function of @xmath14 are opposite to those of the single adatom case .",
    "it is clear that by shifting the chemical potential away from the half - filled particle - hole symmetric case we can have a magnet moment that we can enhance or diminish by changing the chemical potential .",
    "we remark that vacancies in graphene are readily generated by irradiation .",
    "@xcite we also note that organic groups absorbed on the graphene sheet can generate the localized states similar to those induced by vacancies .",
    "@xcite so the organic groups also can be regarded as a kind of ideal vacancies in graphene . and",
    "finally we remark that scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) opens the possibility for experimentalists to place a variety of magnetic adatoms at precise locations on a graphene sheet .",
    "@xcite in principle , our predictions are testable experimentally .",
    "we have not studied how our predictions change as the separation between the two defects increases , other than to show that the effects are most pronounced if the vacancy and adatom are on different sublattice positions .",
    "clearly , if the system has many of either or both defects , the results will likely change significantly .",
    "many vacancies , for example , fill in graphene s pseudo - gap , removing , on the average , the linear density of states .",
