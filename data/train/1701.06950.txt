    "tidal disruption events ( tde ) may help us understand two outstanding questions of black hole astrophysics : how black holes form and grow , and what impact they have on the evolution of their host galaxies ( see a recent review by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* komossa 2015 ) ) .",
    "the first question can be addressed through constraining the low - mass end of the supermassive black hole mass - function ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* stone & metzger 2016 ) ) .",
    "the idea here is that tdes light - up  dormant black holes ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* giannios & metzger 2011 ) ) that have not shown an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) signature before . as the size of both the black hole and",
    "the disrupted star can be estimated well ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gezari et al . 2012 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* guillochon et al . 2014 ) ) , tdes provide means to weigh black holes down to @xmath1 , the majority of which has remained undetected to date .",
    "the second question can be addressed through observations of newly formed radio jets ( triggered by a tde ) on milliarcsecond scales .",
    "very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) is a powerful tool to localise the origin of hi outflows and to reveal the dynamics of atomic gas swept - up by the radio jet , catching agn jet feedback in action ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* morganti et al . 2013 ) ) ; while vlbi of jetted tdes provide us with a unique new chance of observing and understanding the very early phases of jet formation and evolution in an otherwise pristine environment , without any past agn activity .",
    "future blind radio surveys will potentially detect a large number of tdes , but it has been recognised that a multi - band approach is essential for their identification .",
    "the role of vlbi may be two - fold : very high resolution observations of strong candidates may reveal their nuclear origin , supporting the tde identification at early times . on the other hand ,",
    "securely identified tdes ( from x - ray properties and/or optical spectra ) that occur off - nucleus may point to peculiar systems such as a white dwarf disrupted by an intermediate - mass black hole ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* shcherbakov et al . 2013 ) ) , a tde from a recoiling black hole ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* komossa & merritt 2008 ) ) , or it may reveal a secondary galactic nucleus in a merger ( ( * ? ? ? * liu & chen 2013 ) ) .",
    "the latter is potentially interesting since the tde rate is apparently higher in a certain type of post - starburst galaxies that have recently undergone a major merger event ( ( * ? ?",
    "* french , arcavi & zabludoff 2016 ) ) .",
    "it has been shown that jetted tdes will be more efficiently detected in large - scale radio surveys than with current or near - future x - ray missions , therefore tdes will be primary targets of synchrotron transients with the square kilometre array ( ska ) ; the expected numbers however depend strongly on the fraction of jetted events , and their relativistic beaming factors ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* donnarumma & rossi 2015 ) ) . for the first time",
    ", we obtained a strong constraint on the average apparent jet speed for j1644 + 5734 , briefly described below . more details of this result can be found in @xcite",
    "the transient swift j1644 + 5734 was extremely luminous from radio to the @xmath2 rays , that has been widely interpreted as a non - thermal tde with a relativistic jet ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* levan et al . 2011 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bloom et al . 2011 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* burrows et al .",
    "2011 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zauderer et al . 2011 ) ) .",
    "the variability properties in the different bands indicated that the x - ray and the radio emission were most likely produced in different regions , the latter related to a decelerating external shock in an initially ultrarelativistic outflow ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* giannios & metzger 2011 ) ) .",
    "similar models have been invoked to explain multi - band properties of @xmath2-ray afterglows ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zauderer et al . 2013 ) ) .",
    "the vlbi technique has the power to directly reveal relativistic ejecta by for example resolving them . in case of j1644",
    "+ 5734 @xcite predicted that marginally resolving the source may be possible at high frequencies with current vlbi instrumentation ; at 22  ghz and above however the emission is expected to fade quickly .",
    "another way , often successfully applied in quasars up to even very high redshifts ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* frey et al . 2015 ) ) , is to detect the proper motion of relativistic ejecta .",
    "we followed this alternative route .",
    "we observed swift j1644 + 5734 at six epochs between 12 april 2011 and 9 march 2015 with the evn at 5  ghz .",
    "detection of targets at the few - mjy level requires frequent visits to a bright , compact calibrator , a technique called phase - referencing ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* reid & honma 2014 ) ) .",
    "this technique also provides the relative position between the target and the calibrator . for this purpose we used one of the international celestial reference frame ( icrf ) defining sources , j1638 + 5720 as primary calibrator .",
    "the precision of the derived relative position however depends strongly on the separation between these sources ( in our case 55 arcminutes ) .",
    "the larger the angular distance , the larger the systematic errors are .",
    "therefore our strategy was to identify a more nearby compact source in our very first observation , that could be used as a reference point in the following epochs .",
    "we did find a candidate in the first catalogue that was unresolved on milliarcsecond scales , first j1644 + 5736 , with a separation of 2.9 arcminutes .",
    "swift j1644 + 5734 and first j1644 + 5736 were within the primary beam of the smaller telescopes , and only the large dishes had to regularly nod between these sources ( see fig.[fig1 ] for the evn images ) .",
    "using the technique described above , we achieved very high precision relative astrometry between our in - beam reference source and the radio afterglow  of swift j1644 + 5734 .",
    "the standard deviation of our five relative positions spanning three years were 13  @xmath3as in right ascension and 11 @xmath3as in declination , just a tiny fraction ( 1/160th ) of the synthesized beam .",
    "we see no detectable proper motion in swift j1644 + 5734 ( relative to first j1644 + 5736 ) .",
    "the 3-@xmath4 upper limit to the average ( over 3 years ) apparent jet velocity is @xmath0 .",
    "the implied limit on the intrinsic jet speed as a function of viewing angle is shown on fig.[fig2 ] .    if the radio emission is produced by a forward shock analogous to gamma - ray burst jets with a lorentz - factor @xmath5 ( blue line in fig.[fig2 ] ) or higher ( cf .",
    "* zauderer et al . 2013 ) ) , the implied viewing angle is less than 3 degrees",
    ". a lower average lorentz factor ( e.g. due to a dense interstellar medium ) would allow larger viewing angles .",
    "in this case , the observations would indicate that significant deceleration took place within about three years after relativistic ejecta were triggered in swift j1644 + 5734 , and this may be expected in other non - thermal ( jet - forming ) tdes as well .",
    "ultra - precise vlbi astrometry commenced at a closer epoch to the trigger event may give stronger constraints for other tdes in the future , possibly for systems that are less - beamed ( i.e. have a larger viewing angle , but not completely de - boosted ) .    alternatively , the radio jet in swift j1644 + 5734 might have been mildly relativistic ( @xmath6 ) from the beginning , in accordance with what is expected for purely radiatively driven jets ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sadowski & narayan 2015 ) ) . while @xcite detected relativistic reverberation in the accretion flow of the system , and argued for a mildly relativistic wind as the source of x - rays .",
    "these models however do not naturally explain the broad - band properties of swift j1644 + 5734 , that imply a jet with an initially high lorentz factor .",
    "relativistic - jet tdes remain in the forefront of transient research with the evn , and the first result claiming a resolved jet in asassn-14li has just been published by @xcite . in the future ,",
    "we intend to launch a ska - vlbi ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paragi et al . 2015 ) ) follow - up program for the most promising candidates found by the ska ."
