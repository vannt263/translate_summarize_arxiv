    "the first stars in the universe mark the end of the cosmic dark ages , reionize the universe , and provide the enriched gas required for later stellar generations",
    ". they may also be important as precursors to black holes that coalesce and power bright early quasars .",
    "the first stars are thought to form inside dark matter ( dm ) halos of mass @xmath7@xmath8 at redshifts @xmath9 ( yoshida et al . 2003 ) .",
    "these halos consist of 85% dm and 15% baryons in the form of metal - free gas made of h and he .",
    "theoretical calculations indicate that the baryonic matter cools and collapses via h@xmath10 cooling ( peebles & dicke 1968 , matsuda et al .",
    "1971 , hollenbach & mckee 1979 ) into a single small protostar ( omukai & nishi 1998 ) at the center of the halo ( for reviews see ripamonti & abel 2005 ; barkana & loeb 2001 ; bromm & larson 2004 )",
    ".    previously , spolyar et al . ( 2008 ; hereafter , paper i ) first considered the effect of dm particles on the first stars during their formation . any dm particle which is capable of annihilating with itself in such a way as to give the correct relic abundance today",
    "will also annihilate wherever the dm density is high .",
    "the first protostars and stars are particularly good sites for annihilation because they form at high redshifts ( density scales as @xmath11 ) and in the high density centers of dm haloes .",
    "paper i found that dm annihilation provides a powerful heat source in the first stars , a source so intense that its heating overwhelms all cooling mechanisms .",
    "paper i suggested that the very first stellar objects might be _ dark stars _ ( ds ) , a new phase of stellar evolution in which the dm  while only a negligible fraction of the star s mass  provides the key power source for the star through dm heating .",
    "note that the term dark refers to the power source , not the luminosity . in this paper",
    ", we continue the work originally suggested in paper i by studying the ds structure .",
    "the canonical example of particle dm is weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , which automatically provide the right amount of dm , i.e.  @xmath12 24% of the current energy density of the universe .",
    "in many theories wimps are their own antiparticles and annihilate with themselves in the early universe , leaving behind this relic density . in particular , the neutralino , the supersymmetric partner of the w , z , and higgs bosons , is a strong candidate ( reviewed by jungman et al .",
    "1996 ) . as our canonical values",
    ", we use the standard @xmath13 for the annihilation cross section and @xmath14 for the particle mass .",
    "a companion paper will generalize to other masses and cross sections .",
    "the analysis in this paper could apply equally well to other dm candidates .",
    "wimp annihilation produces energy at a rate per unit volume @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the energy density of the wimps . in the early stages of pop",
    "iii star formation , when the gas density is low ( @xmath17 ) , most of the annihilation products simply escape from the protostar without heating it ( ripamonti et al .",
    "however , a crucial transition takes place ( paper i ) when the gas density of the collapsing protostar exceeds a critical value at which point most of the annihilation energy is trapped in the star . for a 100 gev particle , at hydrogen density @xmath18 ,",
    "typically 1/3 of the energy is lost to neutrinos that escape the star , while the other 2/3 of the energy is trapped inside the star .",
    "hence the luminosity from the dm heating is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the volume element .",
    "the properties of the collapsing protostellar clouds have been given by 3d simulations ( abel et al .",
    "2002 ; gao et al .",
    "2007 ) . at the time when the density reaches @xmath21@xmath22 , the critical value for 100 gev particles , paper i found a proto - ds in equilibrium with a radius of 17 au and a mass of @xmath23 , giving a dm luminosity of @xmath24 l@xmath2 . as more mass accretes onto the ds ,",
    "the protostellar luminosity begins to exceed the dm heating , so that the protostar is no longer in thermal equilibrium .",
    "thus it must contract which increases the dm density until the dm heating as given in equation ( [ dmheating ] ) matches its radiated luminosity . in this calculation",
    ", we assume that such a situation can be reached , and we then build up the dark star from a few solar masses up to 1000 @xmath25 , finding its structure as a polytrope in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium at each step in mass .",
    "as we build up the star more dm is pulled into the star via adiabatic contraction and subsequently annihilates ; we find that the annihilation fuel contained in the star can thereby last @xmath26yr . while the results of this paper were being written , a paper appeared by iocco et al .",
    "( 2008 ) which included dm heating in pop iii pre - main - sequence evolution of a set of stars of _ fixed mass _ , finding that the quasi - hydrostatic contraction is halted for times of @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) yr for stars of mass 600 ( 9 ) m@xmath2 , at radii @xmath29 a few au .    during the evolution of a ds ,",
    "additional wimps could be captured via scattering off of nuclei .",
    "the cross section for scattering ( @xmath30 ) is very uncertain . for @xmath31 @xmath32",
    "we find that a dm particle undergoes less than one scattering event in 1 myr in the evolutionary stage considered in this paper .",
    "the experimental bounds for 100 gev particles from dm searches are @xmath33 @xmath32 for the spin - independent case ( gaitskill et al .",
    "2008 ) and @xmath34 @xmath32 for the spin - dependent case ( savage et al .",
    "hence we assume negligible scattering here . however at later stages of the evolution , once the dm density becomes too low to support the star via heating , the ds contracts until nuclear burning sets in . at these higher densities scattering at the experimentally allowed limit would become important .",
    "dm passing through the star could be captured and again drive dm heating .",
    "these effects have been considered for main - sequence and pre - main - sequence ds ( freese et al .",
    "2008 ; iocco 2008 ; iocco et al . 2008 ) , who find that the dm heating could dominate nuclear fusion as long as the background dm density ( from which the capture takes place ) remains high enough .",
    "future work will further consider scattering in the ds .",
    "we also cite previous work on dm annihilation in today s stars ( less powerful than in the first stars ) : krauss et al ( 1985 ) ; bouquet & salati ( 1989 ) ; salati & silk ( 1989 ) ; moskalenko & wai ( 2007 ) ; scott et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ; bertone & fairbairn ( 2007 ) .",
    "we make the assumption that the dark stars ( ds ) can be described as polytropes in hydrostatic equilibrium @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the pressure , @xmath37 is the density , and the constant @xmath38 is determined once the total mass and radius are specified ( chandrasekhar 1939 ) .",
    "pre - main - sequence stellar models are adequately described by polytropes in the range @xmath39 ( fully convective ) to @xmath40 ( fully radiative ) . for a given stellar mass ,",
    "we iterate the radius of the model to find the point of thermal equilibrium , that is , the total dm heating matches the radiated luminosity .",
    "we then add 1 m@xmath2 , calculate a new equilibrium , and continue up to 1000 m@xmath2 . in the standard scenario of formation of the first stars",
    ", it was found that at @xmath41 @xmath22 , the mass of the protostellar cloud exceeds the jeans mass ( e. g. bromm , coppi , & larson 2002 ) .",
    "this amount of baryonic material , @xmath42 m@xmath2 , could fall down onto the ds and in the process bring in more dm with it .",
    "the dm densities in the protostar are derived as described in paper i. we take a @xmath3 m@xmath2 halo composed of 85% dm and 15% baryons .",
    "we take an initial navarro , frenk , & white profile ( 1996 ; nfw ) with a concentration parameter @xmath43 at @xmath44 in a standard @xmath45cdm universe .",
    "we follow the dm response to the changing baryonic gravitational potential as the protostellar gas condenses .",
    "as the baryons come to dominate the potential well in the core , they pull the dm particles inward .",
    "we use the simple adiabatic contraction method of blumenthal et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , barnes & white ( 1984 ) , and ryden & gunn ( 1987 ) ( hereafter blumenthal method ) to estimate the resultant dm density profile .",
    "the method has the limitation that all halo particles are taken to be on circular orbits . recently",
    "( freese et al .",
    "2008b ) , we did an exact calculation using an algorithm originally developed by young ( 1980 ) which takes into account radial motions as well .",
    "the results for the dm density agree with those from the blumenthal method to within a factor of 2 .",
    "this factor of 2 may be compensated by the fact that recent simulations by via lactea ii ( diemand et al .",
    "2008 ) find initial dm density profiles that are steeper in the inner core ( @xmath46 rather than @xmath47 ) .",
    "hence , the blumenthal method should give reasonable results .",
    "the dm density profile in the ds is calculated at each iteration of the stellar structure , so that the dm luminosity can be determined .",
    "the basic equation is that of hydrostatic equilibrium @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the total density ( gas plus dm ) at radius @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the enclosed mass within radius @xmath51 .",
    "the temperature of the gas @xmath53 ) is determined from the equation of state of a mixture of ideal gas and radiation : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath56 is the atomic mass unit , and the mean atomic weight @xmath57 .",
    "we take the h mass fraction @xmath58 and the he mass fraction @xmath59 . in the resulting models @xmath60",
    "k except near the very surface , so the h and he are ionized and the h@xmath10 is dissociated .",
    "we will find the radiation pressure to be important once the ds becomes heavier than @xmath61 .",
    "we also require the ds to be in thermal equilibrium , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the effective surface temperature of the star at its photospheric radius @xmath64 .",
    "note that the observable properties are determined by this temperature .",
    "the location of the photosphere may be determined roughly by the requirement that the optical depth outside of @xmath64 is @xmath65 , which is equivalent to using the photospheric boundary condition @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the surface gravity .",
    "we use a zero - metallicity rosseland mean opacity ( @xmath68 ) table from opal ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) , supplemented at the lowest temperatures by opacities from lenzuni et al .",
    "( 1991 ) .    for each ds mass ,",
    "we find the equilibrium star in the following way .",
    "we guess a value for the outer radius @xmath64 which , along with the mass and the polytropic assumption , can then be used to determine the baryon density distribution .",
    "then the blumenthal method determines the dm density .",
    "one can then use equations ( [ eq : q ] ) and ( [ dmheating ] ) to find the amount of heating in each shell .",
    "our stellar code integrates outwards from the center of the ds , takes a few hundred radial steps , and stops once it satisfies the photospheric boundary condition . the temperature there is set to @xmath63 .",
    "now , one compares @xmath69 with @xmath70 . if @xmath71 , then the next guess for @xmath64 must be smaller in order to increa boundary condition . the temperature there is set to @xmath63 .",
    "now , one compares @xmath69 with @xmath70 . if @xmath71 , then the next guess for @xmath64 must be smaller in order to increase @xmath72 and at the same time decrease @xmath69 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath73 , then the star must expand in order to reduce the dm heating .",
    "we iterate to a convergence in the @xmath74 s to 1 part in @xmath75",
    ".      then we allow surrounding matter from the original baryonic core to accrete onto the ds at @xmath76 m@xmath77 , roughly @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the free - fall time of the core .",
    "the initial ds mass is 3 m@xmath2 and the increment is 1 m@xmath2 .",
    "we remove the amount of dm that has annihilated at each stage at each radius .",
    "we continue stepping up in mass until we reach 1000 m@xmath2 , the jeans mass of the core ( bromm & larson 2004 ) .    with the above accretion rate",
    ", it takes @xmath80 yr to build up to 1000 m@xmath2 . hence the lifetime of",
    "the ds is at least this long . by this time",
    "a significant fraction of the dm inside the ds has annihilated away .",
    "it is not known whether or not the dm inside the ds can be repopulated from dm particles in the @xmath81 halo surrounding it ; this question would require numerical resolution not currently available .    in the future",
    ", it would be interesting to study the accretion process in more detail .",
    "it is likely to proceed via the formation of a disk with an accompanying accretion luminosity . in the standard pop iii star formation process of accretion onto a small @xmath82 nugget",
    ", the luminosity has an accretion - driven phase ; here , on the other hand the accretion luminosity of the much larger ds is always negligible . in any case",
    "our treatment of the structure of the stellar interior is probably unchanged by the presence of the disk .",
    "previously mckee & tan ( 2007 ) have studied the role of angular momentum in pop iii stars in the absence of dm .",
    "one should reconsider angular momentum in the case of ds as well .",
    "table 1 and figure 1 illustrate our results for standard parameters for @xmath83 and for n=1.5 . in the table",
    "we present the sequence of central temperature @xmath84 , photospheric radius @xmath64 , central gas density @xmath85 , central dm density @xmath86 , stellar luminosity ( equal to dm heating luminosity ) @xmath87 , surface temperature @xmath63 , total dm mass inside the star @xmath88 , and time evolved since dm heating dominates inside the star . at 1000 @xmath25 @xmath85",
    "is far lower than for any metal - free zero age main sequence star .",
    "figure 1 plots the baryon and dm density profiles .",
    "the dm density is many of orders of magnitude lower than the baryon density throughout the evolution and yet the dm annihilation powers the star .",
    "as time goes on , one can see that the dm is depleted in the interior regions of the star , due to annihilation , and the density becomes very nearly constant .",
    "the plot of @xmath89 , the dark matter luminosity integrated out to radius @xmath51 , shows that the heating is spread out over much of the volume of the ds ; thus it is not particularly sensitive to changes in the details of the adiabatic contraction model . by the time the ds reaches @xmath90 m@xmath2 ,",
    "the amount of dm in the star is only 1/3 @xmath25 , and 1/3 of the dm in the ds has annihilated away .",
    "we also find that at each evolutionary state , @xmath69 is typically an order of magnitude less than the eddington luminosity for a star of that mass and radius .",
    "we have found that the ds is fully convective for stellar masses below @xmath91 ; makes the transition from convective to radiative in the @xmath92 mass range ( with a radiative zone growing outward from the center ) ; and then becomes ( almost ) fully radiative ( but for a small convective region at the surface ) for @xmath93 .",
    "hence the initial convective period is best described by an @xmath94=3/2 polytrope while the later radiative period is best described by an @xmath94=3 polytrope .",
    "the results above are for an @xmath94=3/2 polytrope all the way up to the final mass . for an @xmath94=3 polytrope ( more appropriate at the higher masses ) , calculated up to 600 @xmath25 , the results are qualitatively the same . for @xmath95 ,",
    "the @xmath94=3 case gives @xmath96 , @xmath97 cm , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 ; while the @xmath94=1.5 case gives @xmath100 , @xmath101 cm , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 .",
    "thus the results for the @xmath39 polytrope give the basic picture . note that ds have much lower @xmath63 than their standard metal free ( pop .",
    "iii ) main - sequence counterparts in the absence of dm , which radiate at @xmath10430,000k .",
    "this difference gives a markedly different observable signature for the ds than for the standard pop iii stars .",
    "we have followed the growth of equilibrium dark stars , powered by dm annihilation , up to 1000 m@xmath2 .",
    "the objects have sizes of a few au and central @xmath105 k. sufficient dm is brought into the star by contraction from the dm halo to result in a ds which lives at least 0.5 myr ( the lifetime could be significantly longer if dm capture becomes important at the later stages , as long as the background dm density is high enough for capture to take place ) . because of the relatively low @xmath106 ( 400010,000 k ) , feedback mechanisms for shutting off accretion of baryons , such as the formation of hii regions or the dissociation of infalling h@xmath10 by lyman - werner photons , are not effective .",
    "the implication is that main - sequence stars of pop .",
    "iii are very massive .",
    "this conclusion depends on uncertain parameters such as the dm particle mass , the accretion rate , and scattering , effects that will be studied in future work .",
    "although ds shine with a few @xmath107 they would be very difficult to observe at @xmath9 .",
    "one can speculate that pristine regions containing only h and he might still exist to lower redshifts ; then ds forming in these regions might be easier to detect .",
    "one may hope that the ones that form most recently are detectable by jwst or tmt and differentiable from the standard metal - free pop .",
    "iii objects .",
    "ds are also predicted to have atomic hydrogen lines originating in the warmer photospheres , and h@xmath10 lines arising from the infalling material , which is still relatively cool .",
    "it has been argued that pop iii.1 stars ( the very first metal - free stars ) may constitute at most @xmath108 of metal poor stars on observational grounds .",
    "heger & woosley ( 2002 ; hw ) showed that for @xmath109 , pair instability ( sn ) lead to odd - even effects in the nuclei produced that are strongly constrained by observations .",
    "thus if pop iii.1 stars are really in this mass range one would have to constrain their abundance .",
    "for @xmath110 , hw find that no sn occurs , and the end result of stellar evolution is collapse of the entire star into a black hole .",
    "we expect , based on extension of the @xmath40 calculation , that our ds runs out of dm at about 700900 m@xmath2 ( for @xmath111 gev ) . then it must contract to the main sequence , where nuclear burning sets in , and further evolution would proceed as in hw .",
    "alternatively , the evolution could proceed as described by ohkubo et al .",
    "( 2006 ) who found that metal - free stars of 500 and 1000 @xmath25 , taking into account two - dimensional effects , did blow up as sn , leaving about half their mass behind in a black hole . in this case",
    "the sn might be observable signatures of ds , distinguishable since they arise from such high mass stars .",
    "the end product in either case would be a plausible precursor of the otherwise unexplained @xmath112 black holes at @xmath113 ( yoshida et al .",
