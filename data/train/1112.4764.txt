    "we extend the discussion to @xmath14 gauges .",

    "let us start from the four - dimensional integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : integral4d ] ) . after wick rotation  , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 . ] and rescaling @xmath39 , we get @xmath40 to simplify the discussion , let us focus on the case @xmath41 @xmath42 the integrand is not a summable function : it is not positive everywhere in the domain of integration , and @xmath43 , which means that the integral is not defined _ per se _ - the value depends on how the boundary is chosen to behave at infinity .",
    "let us therefore compute the value of the integral over different integration domains with different behaviors at infinity : we will observe how the integral may assume every finite value , and even diverge .    as a first example , let us consider a ` spherical cutoff ' in the sense described below . in polar coordinates , we write @xmath44 @xmath45 is a dimensionsless cutoff , being @xmath46 a dimensionsless integration variable .",
    "the angular part vanishes , so there are no problems with the logarithmic divergence of the radial part . actually ,",

    "the darker is the background , the larger is the @xmath48 value .",

    "( [ eq : integralelliptical ] ) can assume different finite values as a function of @xmath53 .",
    "choosing asymmetric boundaries , we even loose tensor invariance , obtaining a @xmath54 matrix of unrelated , indeterminate terms .",
    "this translates into the fact that @xmath55 is no longer proportional to @xmath56 as it should be the case ( see eq  ( [ eq : integral4dwick ] ) ) .",
    "we seek an appropriate choice of the boundaries for all the terms in the @xmath55 matrix in such a way to recover a @xmath56 structure .",
    "we can therefore compute the @xmath55 entries by choosing the same asymmetric boundary on all diagonal terms , and generic symmetric boundaries for all off - diagonal terms . in this way",
    ", all diagonal terms will have the same indeterminate value @xmath29 , whereas off - diagonal terms will vanish .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath57 , with @xmath29 being an indeterminate ( even divergent ) constant .    in the appendix",
    "[ sec : appendix ] we give more details on this and we also consider the case of schwinger regularization .",
    "we find that , also in this case , the value of the integral changes with the angular dependence of the cutoff function .",
    "schwinger regularization turns out to be particularly instructive as the indeterminacy of the integrals is not related to the shape of the integration domain but to the behavior at infinity of the integrand function .",
    "this is a signal of the fact that , in order to tackle the indeterminacy of the critical integrals in this calculations , one exclusively needs to set _ physical constraints _ as there is no mathematical prescription which can univocally determine them .",
    "gastmans _ et al .",
    "_ rely on their finite ( equal to zero ) result for the integral of the type of  eq .",
    "( [ eq : integral4d ] ) , which follows from a _ particular choice of the integration domain_. this also explains why the calculation of ref .",

    "@xcite is the same as the one implicitely taken in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , underscore the fact that the integral  ( [ eq : integral4d ] ) is an indeterminate @xmath58 form : it must be treated with some regularization scheme .",
    "gauge - invariance in the final result can be implemented either _ a priori _ by choosing gauge - invariant regulators ( like pauli - villars or dreg ) , or _ a posteriori _ by applying an appropriate subtraction .",
    "we remark that in the latter case integrals are not well defined , and their values must be considered indeterminate .",
    "if we choose a sharp spherical cutoff we still get the gastmans _ et al .",
    "_ result in unitary gauge as was first shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if we use renormalizable gauges in a cutoff scheme , we recover the standard result (  t  hooft - feynman gauge is used in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    does the fact that two different results are obtained using two different gauge choices mean that a cutoff scheme is not to be pursued at all ? in the following we mean to show that the problem does not reside in the use of a cutoff scheme by itself but rather in figuring out that different ways ( spherical , elliptical etc . ) of implementing a cutoff scheme amount to different values of the integrals ,",
    "i.e. _ , to indeterminate coefficients . we can actually use some cutoff scheme provided that there is a clear recipe on how to absorb the indeterminate coefficients arising in the calculation , also restoring gauge invariance .",
    "_ we will show that such a recipe can not be found in unitary gauge_.    after this discussion one might therefore ask why cutoff renormalization works in several cases independently of the issue of the indeterminate constants discussed above .    for example , let us discuss the cutoff renormalization of vacuum polarization in qed . since we are not protected by ward identity , the integral presents a quadratic divergence @xmath59 the integral is divergent and sign - undefined ; it is ill - defined as the one in eq .",
    "( [ eq : integral4d ] ) .",
    "we could repeat the above considerations to show that we can lower the degree of divergence with an appropriate choice of boundary .",
    "anyway we simply add a photon mass counterterm and impose that the quadratic term vanishes ( i.e. that the photon is massless ) , in order to recover a good gauge invariant theory .",
    "the presence of the counterterm assures that the quadratic divergence disappears _",
    "whatever value the integral has_. in this case , we can forget about the indeterminacy itself , and calculate the integral with the boundary we prefer . on the other hand , we can not choose a boundary and claim that an integral like the one in eq .",
    "( [ eq : integral4d ] ) has a finite value and needs no counterterm ( see gastmans _",
    "et al . _ ) ; we must consider expressly the indeterminacy and add a counterterm to absorb it .",
    "jackiw @xcite showed that indeterminacy can arise if we use regulators which have less symmetry than the theory , and it is not necessarily resolved when we restore the symmetry at the end of calculation . on the other hand ,",
    "if the regulator maintains the symmetry , the result will be univocal .",
    "we can simply understand the case of gauge symmetry : gauge invariant regulators decrease the degree of divergence of the integral , making it finite and regulator independent .",
    "indeed , by naive power counting , we know that the amplitude @xmath60 is logarithmically divergent in renormalizable gauges . in gauge",
    "invariant regularizations , we can group two momentum powers in the numerator to extract the gauge invariant factor @xmath61 , so that the amplitude becomes finite . in unitary gauge too , we expect the same finite amplitude after a not - straightforward cancellation of higher divergent terms .",
    "however , this can not be done in cutoff regularization where the ward identity and gauge invariance are spoiled by the breaking of shift invariance . in the latter case",
    "the integral remains indeterminate or at worse logarithmically divergent .",
    "the expectations by gastmans _",
    "_ to get a finite amplitude which needs no regulator are disappointed by the choice of four - dimensional symmetric integration , which implicitly uses a spherical cutoff scheme , leading to the breaking of gauge invariance and to a divergent amplitude .    to subtract the divergence in the cutoff regularization scheme and , in general , all cutoff - dependent terms",
    ", we need some counterterms . breaking gauge symmetry",
    ", we have the most general lagrangian with all possible combinations of bare fields and bare couplings , even an _ ad hoc _ counterterm of the form @xmath62 .",
    "this is what dyson subtraction means : hide all divergent , cutoff - dependent , non - gauge - invariant terms into a counterterm , which would vanish in a gauge invariant regularization scheme .",

    "@xcite ) . with the use of dreg ,",
    "the second term would give @xmath64 , leading to the well known gauge - invariant expression .",
    "however , let us stay in the framework of gauge - breaking regularizations .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a modified version of dyson subtraction is performed to recover gauge invariance .",
    "one might even wonder whether dyson subtraction is allowed without divergent terms  @xcite .",
    "as we have just shown , the integral in the second term is probably divergent and in any case cutoff - dependent , so we are allowed to add a counterterm and impose gauge invariance as a renormalization condition . in so doing we get the correct amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ eq : amplitudecorrect ] ) .",
    "we would have the same expression by using symmetric integration : every value of the integral disappears into the counterterm .",
    "we are therefore lead to observe that the arbitrariness related to the choice of the boundary ( or , in general , of the regulator ) is solved by imposing gauge invariance .    why gastmans _",

    "( [ eq : amplitudefeynman ] ) the tensor @xmath16 has a well - defined finite coefficient , and we can tune the rest of the amplitude on it , in unitary gauge this coefficient is indeterminate , possibly divergent : we must then add another counterterm @xmath70 to absorb the divergence .",
    "we have now _ two counterterms _ and we need _ two renormalization conditions _ to fix the arbitrariness .",
    "the only dyson subtraction ( which means imposing gauge invariance ) is not enough anymore .",
    "the result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : amplitudewrong ] ) is still arbitrary , and allows the addition of whatever gauge invariant @xmath71 term .",

    "the indeterminacy is resolved ; we recover also the independence of the amplitude on gauge choice and regulator choice .",
    "the main difference between renormalizable @xmath14 gauges and the unitary gauge is in the ultraviolet behaviour of the propagator @xmath73 for finite @xmath74 , the propagator is @xmath75 , and leads to a logarithmic divergent integral , the same as in ",

    "if we use a gauge - invariant regulator , we could simply handle all high divergences and show that all @xmath77-dependent terms in the amplitude vanish , leading to the same result as in the unitary gauge @xcite .",
    "in other words , since gauge - invariant regularizations give meaning to the integrals , we can carry the limit under the integral .    on the contrary , in gauge - breaking regularization ,",
    "divergent integrals have ambiguities , and we have to handle limits with care .",
    "let us study the divergent behaviour in @xmath14 gauges .",
    "the integrals remain logarithmic divergent , so we can perform usual feynman parametrization and shift the integration variables .",
    "we obtain the expression @xmath78 with @xmath79 . despite of the complication of feynman parameters",

    "( [ eq : amplitudefeynman ] ) : the integral can be treated as an indeterminate tensor @xmath80 , while the coefficient of @xmath16 is finite and uniquely determined . as in the previous section , by dyson subtraction we can tune the indeterminate constant and recover the correct gauge invariant amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ eq : amplitudecorrect ] ) .    in the unitary gauge , the behaviour is completely different : the divergent integral in eq .",

    "to summarize , the indeterminate behaviour of @xmath16 in the unitary gauge arises from highly divergent terms which do not appear in @xmath14 gauges .",
    "the limit @xmath81 can not be taken under the integral because integrals are ill - defined , and integrand functions are not measurable .",
