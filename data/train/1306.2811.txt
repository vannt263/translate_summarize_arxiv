    "unitary transformations of the states of two quantum bits ( qubits ) play a prominent role in quantum information processing and computation @xcite .",
    "physically , these quantum logic gates are generated by interactions between qubits and thus the vast majority of them are entangling operations , meaning that they can change the degree to which the states of two qubits are strongly correlated or entangled .",
    "the entangling two - qubit operations , together with suitable single - qubit gates , are also essential for universal quantum computation .",
    "two - qubit operations are elements of the lie group @xmath0 and so are conveniently represented by @xmath6 unitary matrices of unit determinant .",
    "a comprehensive survey of such two - qubit gates is offered by their geometric theory , which was formulated by zhang et al .",
    "this uses both the cartan decomposition of @xmath0 and the theory of local invariants of two - qubit operations @xcite to provide a very useful geometric classification of the two - qubit gates in terms of their local equivalence classes .",
    "these classes are the two - qubit operations that are equivalent up to single - qubit transformations , and thus each class is characterised by its unique nonlocal content and thus its unique entangling capabilities .",
    "the geometric theory of two - qubit gates has recently been utilised in the context of the physical generation of these gates using an optimal - control approach @xcite .",
    "the geometric theory also provides a useful framework for the characterisation of the specific two - qubit gates of most interest in quantum computing .",
    "these include not only familiar logical operations like cnot and swap , but also perfect entanglers , gates that are capable of creating a maximally - entangled state out of some initial product state . where these gates are located in @xmath0 , and the nature of the regions they are in , are issues that can only be properly understood when the geometric structure of @xmath0 is determined .",
    "this geometry will have a major impact on the implementation of any working quantum computer . in constructing its gates ,",
    "we need to know where they are in @xmath0 and how likely it is that we can generate them . for instance",
    ", it was shown @xcite that perfect entanglers occupy exactly half of the volume of the space of all local equivalence classes of two - qubit gates .",
    "this naively suggests that if one randomly picks a nonlocal gate , there will be a @xmath7 probability that it is a perfect entangler .",
    "this same picture also implies that all gates are equally probable ; picking a gate at random is just as likely to produce a gate locally - equivalent to a cnot gate as it is to give one locally - equivalent to a swap .",
    "however , this view ignores the local ( i.e. , single - qubit ) operations that are factored out from the local equivalence classes .",
    "these operations are represented by the @xmath8 subgroup whose curvature contributes to the overall geometry of @xmath0 , and thus to the distribution of locally - equivalent gates . to incorporate this curvature",
    "so as to correctly determine how the local equivalence classes are distributed , we must find an invariant haar measure for @xmath0 .",
    "these considerations motivate the present work .",
    "we first focus on the derivation of the metric structure of @xmath0 , specifically its invariant length element and its haar measure .",
    "we would like to point out that even though calculations using the haar measure for various lie groups , including @xmath0 , have been carried out in the past @xcite , they were not performed in the representation particularly applicable to dealing with entanglement in quantum information processing , namely , one that reflects the natural factorisation of @xmath0 into the single - qubit @xmath8 and purely nonlocal ( two - qubit ) @xmath9 parts .",
    "this factorisation leads to a reduction from fifteen - dimensional @xmath0 to a three - dimensional space in which all locally - equivalent gates live , and we discuss the form of the length element and measure for two particular choices of coordinates for this space .",
    "we then use these derived geometric quantities to proceed towards our main objective : the calculation of the invariant volumes of the regions containing particular gates of interest in quantum information processing .",
    "first , we determine the total volume of the region occupied by perfect entanglers , and find the rather surprising result that these gates make up over @xmath1 of @xmath0 ( thus quantifying the statement that most of the two - qubit operations are perfect entanglers ) .",
    "we then consider regions containing the gates most often used in quantum computing and find that their volume depends on where the gate is , and thus determine how big a `` target '' each gate would present to any quantum control technique designed to generate them .",
    "these calculations show that out of all two - qubit gates , those locally - equivalent to the b - gate ( introduced and described in @xcite ) present the largest effective targets .",
    "the content of this paper has the following structure .",
    "after a discussion of the decomposition and parametrisation of @xmath0 in section [ parametrisation ] , we focus on its geometric properties in section [ haar_measure ] , where we derive the invariant length element and haar measure for the group , presenting the results in both the original parametrisation and in the context of the representation of two - qubit gates offered by the local invariants due to makhlin @xcite .",
    "we then use this haar measure to find the volume of the space of perfect entanglers in section [ pe - sec ] .",
    "section [ qc ] gives the invariant volumes of regions surrounding particular gates of interest , and shows explicitly that these volumes are entirely dependent on where the gate is located .",
    "the conclusion of the paper ( section [ conclusions ] ) is followed by two supplementary appendices where we review two methods for finding an invariant measure , the first ( a ) using the methods of linear algebra and the second ( b ) using the properties of metric spaces .",
    "all unitary gates operating on two - qubit states are described by a @xmath6 unitary matrix , an element of the compact group @xmath10 .",
    "any such matrix may be written as an element of @xmath0 multiplied by a complex number of modulus 1 , so the sixteen parameters we use to specify any gate are the phase of this @xmath11 prefactor ( an angle modulo @xmath12 ) and the fifteen real parameters of @xmath0 .    which fifteen parameters we choose is largely up to us ; for instance , we could use the @xmath0 polar coordinates @xcite or the analogues of the euler angles familiar from classical mechanics @xcite .",
    "however , for our purposes , it is much more convenient to utilise the cartan decomposition of the lie algebra of the group ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; this allows us to write any element of @xmath0 as a combination of matrices in @xmath8 and the maximal abelian subgroup @xmath13 ( which henceforth we will refer to as @xmath14 for brevity s sake ) .",
    "the utility of this decomposition is apparent when we realise that , in the basis @xmath15 , any operation that affects only the first qubit is represented by @xmath16 , and one affecting only the second is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are each @xmath20 unitary matrices .",
    "these _ local _ operations , which act separately and independently on the two qubits , are therefore described by matrices in @xmath8 .",
    "the operations that _ entangle _ the two qubits must then be entirely determined by the matrices from the abelian subgroup @xmath14 .    with all of this in hand , we choose the decomposition of @xmath0 such that our matrices take the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are @xmath6 matrices in @xmath8 and @xmath24 is in the maximal abelian subgroup @xmath14 of @xmath0 .",
    "we can now parametrise the subgroups in the following way : let @xmath25 and @xmath26 be 3-dimensional vectors given in terms of spherical coordinates and cartesian unit vectors by @xmath27 with @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "then if @xmath31 are the usual pauli matrices , a generic element of @xmath8 may be written as @xmath32 \\otimes\\left[i\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{2}\\right ) -i\\hat{\\beta}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma } \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{2}\\right)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the two @xmath8 matrices in equation ( [ su(4 ) ] ) can then be parametrised by four vectors @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 via @xmath37 this takes care of twelve of the fifteen coordinates necessary to specify any @xmath0 element ; the remaining three , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , parametrise the matrix @xmath24 through @xmath41.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to ensure that each @xmath42 is given by a unique set of coordinates , we must restrict @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 to the weyl chamber given by @xmath43 i.e. , within the tetrahedron whose vertices are at @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xcite , as shown in figure [ c - pes ] .",
    "now that we have defined the coordinates and determined their ranges of values , we can choose an orientation ; in this paper , we take the one such that the ordering @xmath48 forms a right - handed coordinate system .",
    "we now want to find a haar measure for @xmath0 in terms of these fifteen parameters .",
    "the basic method for finding such a measure for an @xmath49-dimensional simple compact lie group @xmath50 is reviewed in the appendices , and the first step is to compute the maurer - cartan form @xmath51 and write it in terms of the @xmath49 hermitian lie algebra generators @xmath52 and @xmath49 coordinate 1-forms @xmath53 as @xmath54 @xmath55 is therefore a real @xmath56 matrix whose determinant gives us our invariant measure ( up to an overall factor ) : @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "two of the ways of motivating this particular form of the measure are covered in the appendices , but both require us to somehow compute the determinant of @xmath55 , which for @xmath0 is a @xmath59 matrix .",
    "in this section , we derive expressions for the invariant length element @xmath60 and the haar measure @xmath61 for @xmath0 . both of these have been found before not just for @xmath0 , but for @xmath62 and , indeed , for a great variety of simple compact lie groups ( see , for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , the novelty of our approach is that these quantities will be in forms that are particularly suited for the description of two - qubit gates , namely , in the coordinate system defined in the previous section , which separates the purely local gates in @xmath63 from the entangling gates in @xmath64 .      we choose to do the computation by first finding an invariant length element @xmath60 for @xmath0 ; since this will give the metric tensor via @xmath65 , we may then use the relation @xmath66 .",
    "we could also have explicitly found the full @xmath59 matrix @xmath67 and then computed its determinant ; this can be done using methods similar to those in @xcite .",
    "however , we found that the computation was somewhat simpler using @xmath68 instead ; we now describe the calculation that leads to this .",
    "first , define the three @xmath69-forms @xmath70 by @xmath71 ( the latter holding because @xmath64 is abelian ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the @xmath0 maurer - cartan form @xmath51 can be written as @xmath72 and that the invariant length , given ( see appendix b ) by @xmath73 can be expressed as @xmath74 the traces can be evaluated quickly if we choose an orthonormal basis for @xmath0 ; we take the fifteen generators @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , @xmath78 , which satisfy @xmath79 @xmath8 is spanned by the six matrices @xmath80 and @xmath64 by the three matrices @xmath81 , so the matrices @xmath82 and @xmath24 are @xmath83,\\nonumber\\\\ a\\left(\\vec{c}\\right)&=&\\exp\\left[-i\\sum_{j=1}^3c_jt_{jj}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using these , we can explicitly compute @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath24 and @xmath86 , and thus the length element in ( [ theta - metric ] ) .",
    "the first three terms give the invariant length elements of @xmath8 ( twice ) and @xmath64 , and the next two terms vanish because the two subspaces are orthogonal to each other . the remaining term ",
    "the last  can be most conveniently written using what we know about @xmath87 : the maurer - cartan form for this group has the form @xmath88 where the three 1-forms @xmath89 are @xmath90\\mathrm{d}\\theta\\nonumber\\\\ & & + 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\sin\\theta\\left [ \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\cos\\theta\\cos\\phi -\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\sin\\phi\\right]\\mathrm{d}\\phi,\\nonumber\\\\ \\zeta^{y}\\left(\\vec{\\alpha}\\right)&= & \\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi\\,\\mathrm{d}\\alpha+2\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\left [ -\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\cos\\phi+ \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right ) \\cos\\theta\\sin\\phi\\right]\\mathrm{d}\\theta\\nonumber\\\\ & & + 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\sin\\theta\\left [ \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\cos\\theta\\sin\\phi + \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\cos\\phi\\right]\\mathrm{d}\\phi,\\nonumber\\\\ \\zeta^{z}\\left(\\vec{\\alpha}\\right)&= & \\cos\\theta\\,\\mathrm{d}\\alpha-2\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\cos \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\sin\\theta\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta- 2\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\sin^2\\theta\\,\\mathrm{d}\\phi.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the invariant length element for @xmath0 is therefore @xmath91\\cos c_2\\cos c_3\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\left[\\zeta^y\\left(\\vec{\\alpha}_1\\right ) \\otimes\\zeta^y\\left(-\\vec{\\alpha}_2\\right)+\\zeta^y\\left(-\\vec{\\alpha}_2\\right ) \\otimes\\zeta^y\\left(\\vec{\\alpha}_1\\right)\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\left.\\zeta^y\\left(\\vec{\\beta}_1\\right ) \\otimes\\zeta^y\\left(-\\vec{\\beta}_2\\right)+\\zeta^y\\left(-\\vec{\\beta}_2\\right ) \\otimes\\zeta^y\\left(\\vec{\\beta}_1\\right)\\right]\\cos c_1\\cos c_3\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\left[\\zeta^z\\left(\\vec{\\alpha}_1\\right ) \\otimes\\zeta^z\\left(-\\vec{\\alpha}_2\\right)+\\zeta^z\\left(-\\vec{\\alpha}_2\\right ) \\otimes\\zeta^z\\left(\\vec{\\alpha}_1\\right)\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\left.\\zeta^z\\left(\\vec{\\beta}_1\\right ) \\otimes\\zeta^z\\left(-\\vec{\\beta}_2\\right)+\\zeta^z\\left(-\\vec{\\beta}_2\\right ) \\otimes\\zeta^z\\left(\\vec{\\beta}_1\\right)\\right]\\cos c_1\\cos c_2\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\left[\\zeta^x\\left(\\vec{\\alpha}_1\\right ) \\otimes\\zeta^x\\left(-\\vec{\\beta}_2\\right)+\\zeta^x\\left(-\\vec{\\beta}_2\\right ) \\otimes\\zeta^x\\left(\\vec{\\alpha}_1\\right)\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\left.\\zeta^x\\left(\\vec{\\beta}_1\\right ) \\otimes\\zeta^x\\left(-\\vec{\\alpha}_2\\right)+\\zeta^x\\left(-\\vec{\\alpha}_2\\right ) \\otimes\\zeta^x\\left(\\vec{\\beta}_1\\right)\\right]\\sin c_2\\sin c_3\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\left[\\zeta^y\\left(\\vec{\\alpha}_1\\right ) \\otimes\\zeta^y\\left(-\\vec{\\beta}_2\\right)+\\zeta^y\\left(-\\vec{\\beta}_2\\right ) \\otimes\\zeta^y\\left(\\vec{\\alpha}_1\\right)\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\left.\\zeta^y\\left(\\vec{\\beta}_1\\right )",

    "it is straightforward to confirm that these measures both integrate to unity over @xmath87 and @xmath64 respectively .",

    "when @xmath42 and @xmath103 are decomposed into the form given in ( [ su(4 ) ] ) , they have the same matrix @xmath24 .",
    "thus , any local equivalence class @xmath104\\in{\\mathcal{a}}$ ] is uniquely determined by coordinates @xmath101 in the weyl chamber , and so the invariant measure for the space of these classes is obtained by integrating over all the @xmath87 parameters .",

    "if we change from the standard computational basis @xmath15 to the bell basis @xmath108 then our @xmath0 matrices become @xmath109 , where @xmath110 the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath111 determine all the local invariants of @xmath42 , also called the makhlin invariants @xcite .",

    "are bijective when @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 lie within the weyl chamber and we use the following inverse map @xmath124 : first , find @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 , the roots of the cubic equation @xmath128 ordered so that @xmath129",

    "this matrix is possible but not particularly illuminating , so we do not do it here .",
    "however , it illustrates the key feature , that this part of @xmath60 can be written explicitly in terms of the local invariants without needing to solve ( [ cubic ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the cross - terms in ( [ su4-metric ] )  those involving the @xmath149-forms  depend on the local invariants through @xmath150 and @xmath151 , and writing these explicitly in terms of @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 leads to an extremely complicated form for the length element .",
    "although this part of @xmath60 will not figure into any calculation at a fixed point in @xmath8 , if one is to compute the invariant distance between two arbitrary points in @xmath0 , it is this form that must be used if we choose the local invariants as coordinates .",
    "we have so far discussed only the two - qubit gates that lie in @xmath0 and we will continue to concentrate on this group for the remainder of this article ; however , as stated in the introduction , a general two - qubit gate will be an element of @xmath10 , so we digress momentarily to explain how all of the results just obtained may be easily extended to all of @xmath10 .",
    "this is done through the decomposition @xmath152 , where the first term in the cartesian product contributes to an overall phase factor : @xmath153 with @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 as before and @xmath154 ( considered as a group with addition modulo @xmath12 ) .",
    "the invariant length element and haar measure of @xmath10 are therefore obtained from those of @xmath0 via , respectively , the addition of @xmath155 to ( [ su4-metric ] ) and the wedge product of @xmath156 with ( [ su4-measure ] ) .",
    "however , the coordinates @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 as given in ( [ invariants ] ) will depend on @xmath157 , and so must be redefined so as to be independent of not only the @xmath8 local gates , but also the @xmath11 phase . luckily , this is accomplished by simple division by the determinant of @xmath42 @xcite : @xmath158 this modification ensures that the coordinate transformation from @xmath101 to @xmath159 given by ( [ c - to - g ] ) remains the same .",
    "thus , all our results for @xmath0 will easily extend to @xmath10 ; however , for the remainder of this article , we shall once again concern ourselves only with @xmath0 .",
    "the elements of @xmath0 that perfectly entangle two - qubit states all lie within the subset of the weyl chamber bounded by the planes @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "this region is the interior of the 7-faced polyhedron with vertices at @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath46 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 , the red volume illustrated in figure [ c - pes ] .    at any _ specific _ point in the @xmath8 orbit",
    ", this region fills exactly half of the weyl chamber : if both @xmath22 and @xmath23 are constant , then @xmath168 , and the space is flat .",
    "the euclidean volume  calculated with the normalised measure @xmath169  is @xmath170 .",
    "however , if we are more concerned with those @xmath0 elements that entangle the two qubits , we are not concerned with what the volume of the entangling chamber is at a specific point in @xmath8 ; in fact , since this subgroup only consists of local gates , we are not interested at all in the values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , but rather only in those values of @xmath24 where @xmath101 is in the perfectly - entangling chamber .",
    "therefore , the total volume in @xmath0 occupied by the space of perfect entanglers is obtained by integrating the haar measure around the full @xmath8 orbit , i.e. , all values of @xmath171 , as well as the values of @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 giving the perfect entanglers .",
    "since the four @xmath87 measures are already normalised , and @xmath172 is symmetric around @xmath173 , the integral over the subset of perfect entanglers is @xmath174m_{{\\mathcal{a}}}\\left(c_1,c_2,c_3\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{8}{3\\pi},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so we obtain the rather surprising result that the perfect entanglers occupy over @xmath1 of @xmath0 !",
    "there are two important remarks to make concerning this result : first , we chose to do the computation in @xmath175-space because , in these coordinates , the haar measure has a relatively simple form and the boundary of the region of perfect entanglers is bounded by planes , making the integral of @xmath61 very straightforward .",
    "we could also have chosen to do the integral in @xmath123-space using ( [ measure - makhlin ] ) , but the region of perfect entanglers  the red `` pupil '' in figure [ eos ]  has boundaries much more complicated than planes , and so the volume integral would be much more difficult to calculate .",
    "however , the invariance of our measure ensures that we would obtain the same result of @xmath176 if we did use the makhlin invariants .",
    "secondly , we have shown that perfect entanglers make up a _ majority _",
    "of all two - qubit gates . from the point of view of quantum information processing ,",
    "this is good news , because it suggests that it may be easier than expected to create a perfectly - entangling gate .",
    "in fact , if we are able to pick a two - qubit gate purely at _ random _ , we would get a perfect entangler nearly 85% of the time !",
    "it is this second point that we will address in more detail in the next section : the computation of the invariant volumes of specific regions in @xmath0 , those surrounding the types of gates of particular interest to quantum computing , e.g. ,  the cnot and swap gates .",
    "* note added in proof : * during the refereeing process following the submission of this manuscript , we became aware of @xcite , in which two of our results  the form of the haar measure on @xmath64 and the volume of the space of perfect entanglers  were independently obtained .",
    "however , the technique used in the aforementioned article differs greatly from ours : the measure was obtained by using results from the theory of random matrices @xcite , which gives only its form on @xmath64 and not on the entirety of @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , our approach is geometrically motivated and gives much more general results : we obtain the measure on @xmath64 by first constructing an invariant length element for @xmath0 and then using the associated metric to find a haar measure for the entire group .",
    "the measure on @xmath64 follows from integration around the orbit of @xmath63 .",
    "however , in both cases , once a measure on @xmath64 is obtained , the computation of the volume of the space of perfect entanglers readily follows .",
    "the implementation of any two - qubit quantum computer requires , of course , quantum gates that operate on the two qubits .",
    "creating such gates presents a formidable technical challenge ; one must devise a system in which an element of @xmath0 can evolve from an initial state ( most usually the identity element , but in principle any @xmath0 matrix ) to a final state that is the desired gate .    in practice , however , we can not create a gate _",
    "exactly_. we can only end up within a certain neighbourhood of a given gate .",
    "for example , an arbitrary element of @xmath0 depends on fifteen parameters @xmath177 ; if the gate we want is located at the exact point @xmath178 , we will only ever be able to evolve to a matrix within a certain parameter range around this point , for example , a cubic region @xmath179 .",
    "the likelihood of us being able to evolve the gate into this region depends on its size : the greater the volume of the region , the bigger a target it presents for us to shoot at .",
    "certain gates may be easier to implement with greater precision if the target volume over a given parameter range is large ; if it is small , then it may be quite difficult to end up inside the volume , and we may have to increase the parameter range ( and thus lose precision ) in order to finish near the desired gate .",
    "so how do we determine the target sizes ?",
    "if @xmath0 were a flat space , then all target sizes would be the same for a given parameter range ; for example , the cubic region described above would have volume @xmath180 regardless of what @xmath178 was .",
    "but we know that @xmath0 has a non - euclidean metric , and is not flat . therefore , the volume of a region  obtained by integration of the haar measure  can depend on both the location of the final gate and the range of parameters describing its neighbourhood .",
    "the resulting volumes will tell us how large a target the selected gates present for the range of parameters we choose , and can therefore be used as an indication of how difficult a gate is to achieve with precision .      as above",
    ", we are only concerned with gates that are equivalent up to local @xmath8 operations , so any target volume we compute will include an integration over all of this subgroup .",
    "thus , we will only have to compute integrals over regions of @xmath64 , since all points in this abelian group are indeed distinct modulo local single - qubit operations .",
    "so if @xmath104 $ ] is the equivalence class of the gate @xmath42 , and @xmath181 is a neighbourhood of @xmath104 $ ] in @xmath64 , the volume in @xmath0 that this region occupies is @xmath182    the nonzero curvature of @xmath0 makes it likely that regions in @xmath64 that are described by the same range of coordinates might _ not _ have the same volumes .",
    "specifically , if we choose @xmath101 as our coordinates in @xmath64 , a cube of side length @xmath183 centred at a point @xmath184 in the weyl chamber will not only have a volume different from @xmath185 , but this volume will also vary depending on where it is centred .",
    "the following results illustrate these properties . in all cases ,",
    "the region integrated over is a cube of side length @xmath183 centred on the five basic gates discussed in @xcite ( plus two others , for illustrative purposes ) and whose sides are parallel to the @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 axes :    1 .   @xmath186 $ ] at @xmath44 , with @xmath187 : @xmath188.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for small @xmath183 , this is @xmath189 .",

    "( the upper bounds on the values of @xmath183 in the above expressions come from the fact that if the cubes are too big , then we can not use equation ( [ m - measure ] ) , since it is valid only in the weyl chamber .",
    "computing the volumes of larger cubes is possible but difficult , and we do not do it here . )    the volumes for small values of @xmath183 are included to provide a means of comparison : the smaller the cube is , the closer we are to the exact gate @xmath104 $ ] , and so if we are to implement this gate with any reasonable degree of precision , @xmath183 will have to be small .",
    "the leading - order term in the small-@xmath183 expansion therefore gives the approximate scaling behaviour for each volume , and we see that the largest volume occurs at the [ b - gate ] ( @xmath209 ) and the smallest at the identity and [ swap ] gates ( @xmath210 ) , with the volumes of all other gates lying in between .",
    "all controlled gates have equivalence classes that lie on the @xmath38-axis between the origin and @xmath173 , and the invariant volume of a cube of side length @xmath183 around each of them can be computed in the same fashion as the fixed gates above : if the centre of the cube is at @xmath211 , then if @xmath212 , @xmath213\\cos\\left(2c_1^ * \\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.+\\left[3a\\cos(3a)-3a\\cos(a)-6\\sin(3a)+12\\sin(2a)- 6\\sin(a ) \\right]\\cos\\left(4c_1^*\\right)\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{a^5}{2\\pi}\\left\\{3 - 4\\cos\\left(2c_1^*\\right)+\\cos\\left(4c_1^*\\right ) -\\frac{a^2}{15}\\left[15 - 26\\cos\\left(2c_1^*\\right)+11\\cos\\left(4c_1^*\\right ) \\right]\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.+\\frac{a^4}{5040}\\left[819 - 1640\\cos\\left(2c_1^*\\right)+905 \\cos\\left(4c_1^*\\right)\\right]\\right\\}+o\\left(a^{11}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , for any @xmath214 , the invariant volume scales as @xmath215 .",
    "( for @xmath216 , we recover the previous result shared by the [ cnot ] and [ cphase ] gates . )",
    "all of the above gates lie somewhere on the boundary of the weyl chamber ; if we take a cube of side length @xmath183 that lies entirely _ within _ the weyl chamber , then its volume as a function of its centre @xmath184 is @xmath217 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2}a\\sin{(a)}\\sin{(2a)}m_{{\\mathcal{a}}}\\left(c^*_1,c^*_2,c^*_3\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for small @xmath183 , the prefactor is approximately @xmath185 , the euclidean volume of the cube , and so in this limit @xmath218 is @xmath219 , and thus tells us how much larger or smaller the actual invariant volume is than the euclidean volume .",
    "figure [ m - factor ] plots @xmath219 for three horizontal slices of the weyl chamber , at @xmath220 , @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "these illustrate that @xmath219 vanishes on the boundary of the chamber and peaks in the interior for all @xmath223 .",
    "furthermore , this maximum value increases as @xmath224 decreases toward zero .",
    "in fact , it is on this bottom face that @xmath219 takes on its global maximum of @xmath225 at @xmath216 and @xmath226 .",
    "this demonstrates that cubes near the [ b - gate ] present , for a given side length , the biggest targets .           as is evident from figure [ eos ] , the boundary of the weyl chamber in @xmath123-space is no longer a collection of flat planes but a curved surface .",
    "computing the volumes of regions that abut the boundary ( precisely where many of the gates of interest are located ) is therefore likely to be far more difficult than in @xmath175-space .",
    "it is possible , however , to find exact expressions for the volumes of some regions that lie entirely within the weyl chamber .",
    "this is most easily done by converting to cylindrical coordinates @xmath227 given by @xmath228 , @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "the measure in these coordinates is very simple : @xmath231 . using this",
    ", we can explicitly compute the volumes of various regions centred on the origin : @xmath232    for regions not centred on the origin , the volumes of cubes and spheres tend to be more difficult to compute , but a closed - form expression can be found for the volume of a cylinder ( with axis in @xmath120 direction ) of height @xmath233 and radius @xmath234 centred at @xmath235 . if @xmath236 , the volume is the same as at the origin , namely , @xmath237 . if either @xmath238 or @xmath239 is nonzero , then @xmath240 is positive and the invariant volume of the cylinder is @xmath241 & \\mbox{for}&r<\\rho^ * , \\end{array}\\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath242 and @xmath243 are the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind respectively : @xmath244 for small cylinders with @xmath245 , we find @xmath246 so the volume of the cylinder decreases as we move away from the @xmath120-axis , entirely consistent with the result we obtained in @xmath175-space .",
    "in order to study the geometric properties of @xmath0 in a way that is particularly suitable to a quantum information context  where the emphasis is on the entangling capabilities of two - qubit operations  we have utilised a parametrisation of @xmath0 that reflects the natural decomposition of two - qubit gates into local ( single - qubit ) @xmath8 and purely nonlocal ( two - qubit ) @xmath247 factors .",
    "the latter ( denoted by @xmath64 ) corresponds to the maximal abelian subgroup of @xmath0 and is parametrised by three real coordinates .    in this parametrisation",
    ", we have calculated the invariant length element and the haar measure of @xmath0 , with the latter normalised to provide unit total volume of the group .",
    "these calculations also show that while the purely nonlocal part of the two - qubit operations is geometrically flat , the local part carries a curvature that is carried over to the curvature of @xmath0 .",
    "we continue with a discussion of the metric properties of the abelian subgroup @xmath14 of @xmath0 in the context of a different choice of coordinates , namely , the makhlin invariants .",
    "although these invariants are easily determined from a general element of @xmath0 and the haar measure takes a relatively simple form , the invariant length element is far more complicated .",
    "its form can be determined but is not particularly illuminating ; however , the results we present are sufficient to allow one to compute the invariant distance between two arbitrary points should the local invariants be selected as the preferred coordinates for @xmath64 .",
    "these results allow us to compute the invariant volume of any region in the abelian subgroup @xmath64 of @xmath0 , i.e. , any region in the space of local equivalence classes of two - qubit gates .",
    "we first apply it to the set of perfect entanglers ; these gates , which are capable of creating maximally entangled states out of some product states , correspond to half of the local equivalence classes .",
    "we found that the invariant volume of perfect entanglers occupies more than @xmath1 of the total volume of two - qubit gates , which means that , in fact , the _ majority _ of the two - qubit gates are perfect entanglers .",
    "( our form of the haar measure on @xmath64 and our volume of the space of perfect entanglers are in complete agreement with the recent independently - obtained results in @xcite . )",
    "next , we use the haar measure to find the invariant volumes of locally - equivalent regions around specific gates .",
    "all these regions are described by the same range of parameters , but due to the curvature of the space , not all these regions have the same volume .",
    "in fact , the invariant volumes depend entirely on where in @xmath64 the region lies .",
    "we find that the volume is smallest around the identity and swap gates and largest at the b - gate , with all other volumes falling in between .",
    "these results are relevant to quantum information processing and its physical implementation in general , and in particular , to recent efforts @xcite to use optimal control approach to generate two - qubit quantum operations , where the control objective is any gate of a given entangling power rather than a specific two - qubit gate . in cases where the objective is to achieve a perfect entangling gate , our conclusion that the majority of _ all _ gates are perfect entanglers is highly encouraging .",
    "if the objective is to create one of the more familiar logical gates , our results show that generating a swap gate with any precision may be difficult due to the low density of gates in its neighbourhood , whereas the high density near the b - gate suggests that it could be relatively easy to generate .",
    "since the b - gate is one of the gates that is needed to create a universal quantum computer , this is also an encouraging result .",
