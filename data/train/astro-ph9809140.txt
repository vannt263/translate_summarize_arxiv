    "soft - gamma repeater sources ( sgrs ) were recognized as a new class of objects in the late 80 s ( @xcite ) . to date , only four sgrs are confirmed ; a fifth sgr source may have been detected twice ( @xcite ) but its existence is not yet firmly established .",
    "what distinguishes these transient soft @xmath4ray bursters from the ` classic ' @xmath4ray burst sources is their recurrence and the much softer spectra of their bursts .",
    "sgrs undergo random intervals of intense activity , during which they emit bunches of up to hundreds of very short , low - energy bursts .",
    "the bursts vary in duration and temporal structure from simple , single pulses lasting less than 10 ms ( @xcite ) , to long , highly complex events that comprise over 40 very short subpulses each lasting tens of ms ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sgr burst arrival times seem to be distributed lognormally , similar to the distribution of earthquakes ( @xcite ) .",
    "three sgrs have firm associations , based on positional coincidences , with supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "the position of sgr  @xmath0 , has only recently been determined with sufficient accuracy ( @xcite ) to establish that it lies close to the snr g  @xmath5 , whose association with sgr  @xmath0  was suggested earlier ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sgr / snr associations indicate that sgrs are neutron stars , a conjecture strongly supported by the detection of a three - minute train of 8 s pulsations following the famous march 5 , 1979 event from sgr  @xmath6 ( @xcite ) .",
    "searches for pulsed emission in the sgr persistent flux were finally successful when observations of sgr  @xmath2 with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte  _ ) in november 1996 revealed a 7.47 s x - ray pulsar ( @xcite ) .",
    "_ rxte  _ observations of the newly discovered sgr  @xmath7 ( @xcite ) indicated weak evidence of 6.7 s pulsations from the source ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , in recent observations ( april 1998 ) of sgr  @xmath0  hurley et al .",
    "( 1998e ) detected pulsed emission with 5.16 s period .",
    "the pulsations of sgr  @xmath2 show a secular spindown . as argued by kouveliotou et al .",
    "( 1998 ) this spindown is due to magnetic dipole radiation ; the corresponding dipolar component of the magnetic field of sgr  @xmath2 exceeds @xmath8 g , thus establishing sgrs as ` magnetars ' ( @xcite ) .",
    "we report the results of observations with _",
    "rxte  _ obtained soon after the reactivation of the source was detected with the burst and transient source experiment ( _ batse  _ ) on _ cgro  _ and ulysses in may 1998 ( @xcite ) .",
    "additional observations were obtained after the recent extraordinary source activity of august 1998 ( @xcite ) , when it emitted several events , one similar to the march 5 , 1979 event ( @xcite ) . during these observations we detected the 5.16 s pulse period ( @xcite ) , and found that it shows a secular spin - down at a rate similar to that observed for sgr  @xmath2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the great similarities between sgrs indicate that the causes of the spin - down of the pulsations in sgr  @xmath0  and sgr  @xmath2 are the same , i.e. , sgr  @xmath0  is also a magnetar ; its dipolar magnetic field strength is @xmath9 g.",
    "we observed sgr  @xmath0  between may 31 and june 9 , 1998 for a total of 41.7 ks on source .",
    "after excluding all bursts from the time series , the data were energy - selected ( 2 - 20 kev ) , barycentered and binned at 0.25 s resolution .",
    "we calculated a fast - fourier power spectrum of the resulting light curve , searching between 0 - 2.0 hz for the 5.158975(7 ) s period reported for sgr  @xmath0  from the _ asca  _ data ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure 1a shows the power density spectrum ( pds ) of the fft ; we can clearly see the fundamental period at 5.159142(3 ) s ( 0.193831 hz ) ( @xmath10 ) and its first , second and third harmonics .",
    "the chance probability of detecting this signal at the sgr  @xmath0  period is less than @xmath11 .",
    "this number is derived after we averaged the power of the fundamental and the three harmonics between @xmath12 hz , taking into account the number of trials .",
    "we do not find significant power at any other frequency ; in particular , we do not detect signal at the 89.17 s ( 0.011 hz ) period from the x - ray pulsar xte  j@xmath13 reported earlier ( @xcite ) in the error box of sgr  @xmath0  .",
    "figure 2a shows the epoch - folded pca pulse profile ; it is very similar to the profile from the _ asca  _ data obtained roughly a month earlier ( @xcite ) , although the energy ranges are not identical ( the _ asca  _ range is 2 - 10 kev ) .",
    "the two periods differ significantly ; we estimate the period derivative between the _ asca  _ and _ rxte  _ observations to be @xmath14 s / s . using a pulse folding analysis on the pca data alone , in which the period is assumed to be given by @xmath15",
    ", we find that during the 10 days of the pca observations a significant change of the period occured .",
    "the best fit is @xmath16 s / s .",
    "we discuss the difference between the two @xmath17 values in section 3 .",
    "sgr  @xmath0  started triggering _",
    "batse  _ again on august 28 , 1998 .",
    "prior to this first trigger , the _ rxte  _ /all sky monitor had detected a rising transient source from the same direction as sgr  @xmath0  ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the ulysses and _ konus - wind  _ spacecraft recorded an extremely intense event on 27 august , 1998 , which was very similar to the march 5 , 1979 event ( @xcite ) ; during this event the source was occulted by the earth for _ batse  _ ( @xcite ) . a new series of too observations was initiated with _",
    "we have analyzed 2.5 ks of on source data obtained on august 28 , 1998 . from a pulse timing analysis we find the pulsar period to be @xmath18 s ( on @xmath19 )",
    "; the @xmath17 during the august 1998 observation is @xmath20 s / s .",
    "figure 1b shows the pds of the fft ; the fundamental and the first harmonic dominate this spectrum .",
    "the average @xmath17 between the first and second _",
    "rxte  _ observations is @xmath21 s / s , 2.6 times the rate between the _ asca  _ and the first _",
    "rxte  _ observation .",
    "the folded pulse profiles obtained during 1998 may and august are clearly different ( see fig .",
    "2b ) , although they cover the same energy range ; the august 1998 profile is also different from that obtained with _ asca  _ .",
    "this is reminiscent of sgr  @xmath2 ( @xcite ) , for which we observed a spiky pulse profile with substructure when the source was ` inactive ' ( _ asca  _ observation ) , whereas a smooth , almost sinusoidal profile appears _",
    "after _ the source had become very active ( _ rxte  _ observation ) .",
    "the variable pulse profile of sgr  @xmath0  could be ascribed to residual heat output in the active region following the august 27 event .",
    "the evolution of @xmath17 is shown in figure 3 , where we plot the rate of spindown calculated between each consecutive observation as well as within each _",
    "rxte  _ observation . note that the spindown rate remains practically constant after june 1998 .      in the august 1998 _",
    "rxte  _ observations we found systematic departures of pulse phases from the best fit ephemeris .",
    "these departures of @xmath22 cycles typically persisted for a few thousand seconds . since such signatures",
    "can potentially be due to binary orbital motion , we searched for periodic variations in the pulse phases .",
    "we analysed 53 ks of _ pca  _ standard1 data from august 28 to september 2 .",
    "after data from bursts were eliminated , the rates were divided into 400s intervals , with a pulse profile determined for each interval .",
    "pulse phases were then determined by correlation with the average pulse profile .",
    "a search for sinusoidal variations was conducted for orbital periods from @xmath23 to @xmath24 s , but no orbital modulation was found . for periods in the range of @xmath23 s @xmath25",
    "s we can limit circular orbits to @xmath26s ( 95% confidence ) . for",
    "@xmath27s@xmath28s , possible companion masses must be below @xmath29 , assuming a 1.4@xmath30 neutron star .",
    "it is likely the short - term departure of the pulse phases from the long - term ephemeris is due to pulse shape variations .",
    "we see minor changes in the pulse shape over the course of the august observations , while more dramatic changes are evident between the first and second _ rxte  _ observation .",
    "we have performed spectral fits using xspec to the persistent emission data for both _",
    "rxte  _ observations . in both spectra",
    "we find evidence of a line at @xmath31 kev ; the best fit was obtained for a powerlaw + gaussian model .",
    "the values for the power law ( photon ) index , @xmath32 , and line centroid are , ( 2.1 , 3.4@xmath33 , 6.6 kev ) and ( 3.1 , 5.5@xmath33 , 6.5 kev ) for june 2 and august 28 , 1998 , respectively ; the line is more significant in the first observation .",
    "the power law index and @xmath32 values for june 2 are consistent with the values reported from the _ asca  _ data ( @xcite ) ; the august 28 data exhibit a higher @xmath32 and a softer spectrum .",
    "we can not confidently attribute the line to sgr  @xmath0  as the _ rxte  _ field of view is @xmath34 times larger than that of _ asca  _ and may include contamination from other sources ,  such as xte  j@xmath13 which was active at least after august 30 , 1998 ( @xcite )  , as well as from the diffuse galactic emission .",
    "we have further estimated the unabsorbed persistent flux between 2 - 10 kev to directly compare it with the _ asca  _ flux of @xmath35 ergs/@xmath36 s reported for april 30 , 1998 ( @xcite ) .",
    "for the june 2 and august 28 , 1998 observations , the fluxes are @xmath37 ergs/@xmath36 s and @xmath38 ergs/@xmath36 s , respectively ( after taking into account the effect of the 0.441@xmath39 offset of the _ rxte  _ pointing ) . assuming a distance to the source of @xmath40 kpc ( @xcite )",
    ", we find that the luminosity of sgr  @xmath0  varied from @xmath41 ergs / s to @xmath42 ergs / s , i.e. , it was a factor of @xmath34 higher during its second active episode .",
    "although we can not exclude the contribution of the diffuse galactic emission and source contamination in the absolute values of these estimates , we believe that the ratio of the two values yields the true luminosity increase between the two episodes .",
    "we have confirmed the second case of a pulsar ( @xcite ) associated with the persistent emission of an sgr and have been able to measure a secular increase in its period .",
    "the first case , sgr  @xmath2 , had a very similar period and period derivative of 7.47 s and 8.3@xmath43 s / s , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have argued that the secular spindown of sgr  @xmath2 was due to torques from magnetic dipole radiation and a relativistic wind , and we have estimated the pulsar characteristic spindown age and ( dipolar ) magnetic field strength to be @xmath44 years and @xmath45 g , respectively .",
    "our earlier observations demonstrated the existence of ` magnetars '  neutron stars with superstrong magnetic fields ( @xcite )  and supported models attributing sgr bursts to crustquakes produced by magnetic stress ( @xcite ) .    in view of the strong similarities between sgrs",
    ", it would appear that in sgr  @xmath0  the spindown is also the result of a magnetized wind .",
    "the almost constant @xmath46 observed in sgr  @xmath0  between the may and august 1998 _",
    "rxte  _ observations ( see figure 3 ) implies @xmath47 g , if the vacuum magnetic torque were the only torque acting on the star .",
    "the age of sgr  @xmath0  would be @xmath48 years , i.e. , so short that one must give up any physical association between it and the nearby snr g  @xmath5 .",
    "first , the remnant is much older and , second , a tangential velocity of @xmath49 km s@xmath50 would be required at a distance of @xmath51 kpc .",
    "the smaller @xmath52 s / s between the _ asca  _ and the _",
    "rxte  _ may 1998 observations could be ascribed to a glitch of magnitude @xmath53 during that interval .",
    "large glitches in the range @xmath54 are indeed implied by an extrapolation of the glitching behavior of young pulsars to the much slower spins of the sgr and the ` anomalous x - ray pulsar ' ( axp ) sources ( @xcite ) ; but it is surpising that sgr  @xmath0  should not also have been observed to glitch during the great burst of activity associated with the august 27 event .",
    "the spindown rate of a magnetar may , however , be grossly underestimated by the vacuum dipole formalism .",
    "the dipole luminosity @xmath55 erg s@xmath50 is much smaller than the quiescent x - ray luminosity ( @xmath56 erg s@xmath50 for both the axp and sgr sources ) as well as the time - averaged burst luminosity ( @xmath57 erg s@xmath50 during an active phase of sgr  @xmath2 ) ( @xcite ) . in this context ,",
    "quiescent particle emission driven by internal seismic activity increases the spindown luminosity to @xmath58 ( @xcite ) and the simple estimate of the magnetic field derived above from @xmath59 and @xmath60 is an overestimate .",
    "this effect is especially important for sgr  @xmath2 , where @xmath61 erg s@xmath50 is inferred from observations of the surrounding radio halo ( @xcite ) on both small and large angular scales ( @xcite ) ; for that source the required value of @xmath62 is reduced to @xmath63 g.    transport of a magnetic field through the core and rigid crust of a neutron star leads to two basic modes of energy release ( @xcite ) : internal frictional heat which is partially conducted to the surface ; and frequent low energy fractures that couple to magnetospheric alfvn modes and thence to energetic particles . in this model ,",
    "an sgr burst is triggered only if the alfvn mode has a large enough amplitude to cascade to high wavenumber before leaking out of the magnetosphere ( @xcite ) .",
    "if sgr  @xmath0  turns on as a quiescent particle source ( @xmath64 ) during brief periods of burst activity , then its true age exceeds our measured value of @xmath65 , and a physical association with snr g  @xmath5 ( estimated age @xmath66 yr ; @xcite ) becomes possible . a magnetic field @xmath67 g is required for dipole radiation alone to spin down the star to a 5.16 s period at an age of @xmath68 yr .",
    "given this value of @xmath62 , the period derivative is raised above its long term average to @xmath69 s / s if @xmath70 erg s@xmath50  well below the particle luminosity inferred for sgr  @xmath2 .",
    "the total energy injected in relativistic particles between the two _",
    "rxte  _ observations is @xmath71 erg ( not including any particles injected during the august 27 event ) .",
    "comparison with the energy of the 1@xmath72 synchrotron bubble around sgr  @xmath2 ( @xcite ) suggests that radio flux may be detectable ( at the 0.1 mjy level ) . at this more advanced age , the tangential velocity needed to propel sgr  @xmath0  out of snr g",
    "@xmath5 is @xmath73 km s@xmath50 .",
    "several mechanisms could impart unusually high velocities to magnetars at birth ( @xcite ) .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath60 and quiescent @xmath74 in sgr  @xmath0  is mirrored in the behavior of the axp sources .",
    "as is the case for sgr  @xmath2 , the value of @xmath75 for sgr  @xmath0  is smaller than any of the ( five ) values measured so far , the best - studied axp , is discussed most recently in @xcite . ] for ` anomalous x - ray pulsars ' ( axps ) , which have also been suggested to be magnetars ( @xcite ) .",
    "this supports the suggestion ( @xcite ) that axps are a later , less active , phase in the evolution of sgrs .",
