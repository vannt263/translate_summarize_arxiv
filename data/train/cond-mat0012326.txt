    "the partition function of the new system is computed assuming that the correlations of the @xmath8 old spins can be neglected ( technically speaking we suppose there is a single pure state ) : each spin lives in an effective field @xmath38 .",
    "so one writes    @xmath39    this is easily computed , thanks to ( [ loi ] ) , and one gets by differentiation of @xmath40 with respect to @xmath41    @xmath42    where we used the fact that @xmath43 , the magnetization of site @xmath44 _ before _ the addition of the new point , is nothing but @xmath45 .",

    "this equation is actually well known , for it also appears in the solution with replicas ( see @xcite , eq .",

    "the advantage is that , within the cavity approach , @xmath64 is given a simple probabilistic interpretation in terms of the occupation numbers .",

    "aldous notices that his method also yields equation ( [ eqg ] ) ( see section 5.1 of @xcite ) , but we would like to stress that his approach and ours actually meet at an earlier stage : indeed our essential equation is not ( [ eqg ] ) but rather the couple ( [ min])-([occupation ] ) ; the rest , including the introduction of @xmath64 , is mere calculus . roughly speaking ,",
    "aldous s method consists in linking the @xmath14 limit of the matching problem to a matching on an infinite tree .",
    "let us concentrate on case @xmath4 .",
    "such matching is constructed introducing i.i.d .",
    "r.v . @xmath89  related to the root  and @xmath90  related to its children  , and the points @xmath91 of a poisson process of rate 1 ( see section 3.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "these quantities satisfy    @xmath92    and the root of the infinite tree is matched to its child attaining the minimum .",
    "this is strongly reminiscent of ( [ min])-([occupation ] ) .",
    "more precisely , if one relabels the @xmath93 so that they be sorted in increasing order , and consistently relabel the @xmath94 , the probability law of @xmath95 tends to a poisson process of rate 1 .",
    "thus ( [ min ] ) becomes identical to ( [ ald ] ) , provided we identify @xmath96 and @xmath94 .    indeed ,",
    "if we also take into account aldous s heuristic considerations , similarities can be found even before ( [ min ] ) : in section 5.3 of @xcite , aldous gives indications for a possible extension of his method to the finite temperature problem .",
    "using the same kind of r.v . as in ( [ ald ] )",
    "he writes down the equation    @xmath97    which can be identified with the cavity equation ( [ cavite ] ) . of course , the same way we derive ( [ min ] ) from ( [ cavite ] ) using trick ( [ defphi ] )",
    ", aldous observes that ( [ ald2 ] ) is consistent with ( [ ald ] ) in the @xmath98 limit .",
    "such formal similarities are striking but we are unable to account for them .",
    "whether some further study can lead to more a rigorous basis for the cavity method is not clear , because we define the @xmath99,@xmath100 through the somewhat exotic procedure of taking the @xmath101 limit of a @xmath24-spin model .",

    "we have shown that the cavity method yields predictions for @xmath2 which are consistent with both rigorous results and numerical simulations .",
    "let us emphasize that our results also hold for the bipartite minimum matching ( or assignment ) problem .",
    "it has already been observed that the latter and the problem we discussed in this paper are equivalent in the @xmath14 limit , up to normalization conventions @xcite . in appendix",
    "b we briefly show how this can be seen within our formalism .",
    "here we write @xmath210 for @xmath157 , to highlight its dependence on @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath211 be the function given on @xmath1581,+\\infty[$ ] by    @xmath212    @xmath211 strictly decreases from @xmath131 down to 0 , and @xmath210 is defined by    @xmath213    a small computation leads to    @xmath214    and    @xmath215    so that , for large enough @xmath19 ,    @xmath216    beside ,    @xmath217    one has @xmath218 and so @xmath219 thanks to the right hand side of ( [ encadre ] ) .",
    "thus    @xmath220    it follows that    @xmath221    @xmath222 increases with @xmath19 , and goes to 1 when @xmath6 , as shown by ( [ encadre ] ) .",
    "more precisely , it goes exponentially fast to this limit : ( [ pouralpha ] ) implies    @xmath223 & = & \\left ( \\frac{2}{\\alpha_r } \\right)^r \\rightarrow 1 \\ ; \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\mbox{by ( \\ref{encadre } ) } \\\\ \\mbox{i.e . } \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; ( \\alpha_r-1)^r & = & 1-\\frac{1}{2^r}+o(\\frac{1}{2^r})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the bipartite minimum matching problem can be stated as follows : take @xmath224 points @xmath225 divided into two subsets , @xmath226 ( @xmath37 ) and @xmath227 ( @xmath228 ) such that the distances between a point in @xmath226 and a point in @xmath227 follow the probability distribution @xmath229 of ( [ rho ] ) , and allow only matchings where each pair is made of a point from a and a point from b. one can see it as a particular case of non bipartite matching problem for the points in @xmath230 , setting that the distances inside each subset are infinite , i.e. @xmath231 for @xmath232 or @xmath233 .",
    "then imagine that you add a new point @xmath234 to , say , subset @xmath226 .the cavity equation ( [ cavite ] ) is slightly modified          provided we relabel the @xmath99 , @xmath237 and redefine @xmath238 , we get exactly the same equation ( [ cavite ] ) as in the case of the non bipartite matching problem .",
    "indeed it is known from the replica approach @xcite that , for systems where the lengths @xmath13 are uncorrelated random variables , the bipartite and non bipartite matching problems have the same limit when @xmath14 and differ in the @xmath239 corrections .",
