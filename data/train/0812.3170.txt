    "frustration is a phenomenon characterized by the existence of more than one low - energy configuration .",
    "the pasta phase is a frustrated system @xcite . at densities of the order of 0.006 - 0.1 @xmath3 @xcite in neutral nuclear matter and 0.04 - 0.065 @xmath3 @xcite in @xmath2- equilibrium stellar matter , a competition between the strong and the electromagnetic interactions takes place leading to a frustrated system .",
    "the basic shapes of these complex structures were first named @xcite after well known types of cheese and pasta : droplets ( bubbles = swiss cheese ) , rods = spaghetti ( tubes = penne ) and slabs ( lasagna ) for three , two and one dimensions respectively . a droplet ( bubble ) and a rod ( tube ) have densities larger ( smaller ) than their surroundings , and are normally defined within a wigner - seitz cell .",
    "the pasta phase is the ground state configuration if its free energy per particle is lower than the corresponding to the homogeneous phase at the same density .",
    "the pasta phase is expected to exist somewhere between a solid and a liquid phase , more like a liquid crystal @xcite .",
    "its mechanical and thermal properties are likely to depend on its shape and this study still remains to be done .",
    "these pasta shapes at sub - nuclear densities are expected to exist both in the crust of neutron stars ( zero temperature , very low proton fraction , matter in @xmath2- equilibrium ) and in supernova ( finite temperature , proton fraction around 0.3 ) . in neutron",
    "stars the pasta phase coexists with a neutron gas ; in supernova there is no neutron gas or it is very low in density @xcite .    in a recent work @xcite",
    "we have studied the existence of the pasta phase at zero and finite temperature within three different parametrisations of the relativistic non - linear walecka model ( nlwm ) @xcite , namely nl3 @xcite , tm1 @xcite and gm3 @xcite , the last one generally used in the studies of stellar matter . at zero temperature",
    "two different methods were used : the coexisting phases ( cp ) and the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation .",
    "we have checked that while the final equation of state ( eos ) obtained with the different methods do not vary much , the internal structure varies considerably .",
    "the tf approximation was performed to test the much simpler cp calculation and we have seen that the success of the cp calculation depends on the parametrisation of the surface energy for very small proton fractions and close to the transition densities . at finite temperature",
    "only the cp method was used and compared with predictions from spinodal calculations .",
    "the pasta phase shrinks with the increase of the temperature and we have found that homogeneous matter can be the preferential phase also at very low densities depending on the temperature and the proton fraction .",
    "if @xmath2- equilibrium is imposed the pasta phase does not appear in a cp calculation .",
    "this indicates the necessity to use a good parametrisation for the surface energy which is temperature , proton fraction and geometry dependent , as also stressed in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite have related the fraction of the moment of inertia contained in the crust of the vela pulsar with the mass and the radius of the neutron star and the pressure and density at the crust - core interface . from realistic eos",
    "they have obtained an expected range of values for the pressure at the inner edge of the crust and therefore also a relation between the radius and mass of the pulsar .",
    "this work shows the importance of understanding the exact density limits of the pasta phase and its consequences on the choice of appropriate equations of state .",
    "more recently a new radius - mass relation for the vela pulsar was obtained taking as constraints recent isospin diffusion data from heavy - ion reactions @xcite . in this work",
    "both the thermodynamical and the more accurate and reliable dynamical method were utilized in order to constrain the densities and related pressures of the pasta phase present in the crust of neutron stars .",
    "the pressures were obtained from the equation of state for neutron - rich nuclear matter constrained by isospin diffusion data obtained in the same sub - saturation density range as the existing ones in the neutron star crust @xcite .",
    "it is , however not clear how good are the predictions for the transition density obtained from spinodal calculations .",
    "clusterisation of the crust may have been formed through equilibrium processes and it is important to compare spinodal results with equilibrium results , obtained from the minimization of the free energy . in @xcite a first comparison was done and it was shown that as a rule the transition densities obtained within an equilibrium calculation are larger than the ones determined from the dynamical spinodals .    in the present work we use the same approximations ( cp and tf ) used in @xcite to obtain the pasta structures , but improve on the choice of the relativistic models , i.e. , we obtain results with various density dependent hadronic models and investigate the influence of the delta mesons .",
    "we next justify our choices .    density dependent hadronic models @xcite have shown to provide richer and different results in many cases as compared with the simpler nlwm parametrisations @xcite . in many situations",
    "the results are similar to the ones obtained with non - relativistic skyrme - type models @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the isovector - scalar virtual @xmath4 meson in hadronic effective field theories @xcite influences the calculation of the effective masses with important consequences on the symmetry energy , spinodals @xcite and other quantities possibly related with the appearance of the pasta phase .",
    "the @xmath0 field introduces in the isovector channel the structure already existing in the isoscalar channel , i.e. , a balance between a scalar ( attractive ) and a vector ( repulsive ) potential .    in the following we consider three density dependent coupling parametrisations , tw @xcite , ddh@xmath0 @xcite and gdfm @xcite and two models with constant couplings , nl3 and nl3@xmath0 .",
    "neither nl3 nor tw include the @xmath0 meson .",
    "a comparison is done between the transition pressures and densities from the pasta phase to homogeneous matter obtained within the above mentioned models , with the predictions obtained in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we briefly review the formalism underlying the homogeneous neutral @xmath1 matter . in section",
    "iii the pasta phase is built with the help of the coexisting phases method and in section iv with the thomas - fermi approximation . in section v our results are displayed and commented and in section vi our conclusions are drawn .",

    "the nl3@xmath0 parametrisation is defined with the same values for @xmath67 and @xmath68 as in the nl3 parametrisation , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , in such a way that the symmetry energy has the same value at the saturation density as the nl3 parametrisation .",
    "we show in table [ prop ] the nuclear matter properties reproduced by the models we discuss in the present work .    .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in table [ t5 ] the transition densities obtained within the cp approach and using the thermodynamical spinodal are given .",
    "no data for a dynamical spinodal calculation at finite temperature is available , except for nl3 , see @xcite , where the transition densities 0.080 , 0.077 @xmath3 were given respectively for @xmath72 and 0.3 at @xmath73 mev . in this case",
    "no crossing occurs for @xmath2-equilibrium matter .",
    "these values are similar to the ones obtained within the cp calculation . as discussed before we expect that the dynamical spinodal defines a lower limit for the transition density . from the discussion of the results obtained for the pasta phase at @xmath51 mev",
    ", we also expect that the cp calculation only gives a lower limit for the transition density because of the description of the surface which takes too large values .",
    "the thermodynamical spinodal only suggests an order of magnitude , which , according to @xcite and for nl3 , was always a bit larger than the values coming from the cp approach and closer to the tf results for the nlw models .    for the ddh models",
    ", it is seen that within the cp approach , and similarly to the result already discussed at @xmath51 mev , the pasta phase at @xmath73 mev does not decrease when going from @xmath72 to @xmath74 for both the tw and ddh@xmath0 models .",
    "it is also seen that for symmetric matter the prediction obtained from the thermodynamical spinodal is generally quite larger than the values obtained within the cp calculation , except for the ddh@xmath0 model , when they are similar .",
    "this may indicate that within a tf calculation larger transition densities would be obtained .",
    "self - consistent calculations at finite temperature , both for the pasta phase and for the dynamical spinodal still have to be implemented .",
    "these are of particular interest because neutrino trapping occurs at finite temperature , and we expect that the interaction of neutrinos with the @xmath1 clusters may affect the neutrino energy deposition in stellar matter .",
    "however , while the cp calculation fails to predict the transition densities for @xmath2-equilibrium matter , we expect that it gives reasonable results for the proton fractions of interest for stellar matter with trapped neutrinos , @xmath75 .",
    "we show in table [ tabtemp ] the highest temperatures for the existence of the pasta phase for each of the models discussed in this work within the cp approach .",
    "we take these values as lower bounds for the limit temperature above which the non - homogeneous phase disappears .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that we have searched for the pasta structures at temperature steps of 1 mev , due to the uncertainties mentioned above , and therefore the limiting temperature given is not more than an order of magnitude .",
    "there are two different situations that had to be considered when the homogeneous phase was taken as the equilibrium configuration : a ) the pasta phase exists but it is not the preferential state of matter because its free energy comes out higher than the homogeneous phase and b ) the pasta phase does not exist within the precision of our calculations .",
    "in the present work we have investigated the extension of the pasta phase for @xmath1 matter described within relativistic density dependent models , namely tw @xcite , ddh@xmath0 @xcite and gdfm @xcite , both at zero and finite temperatures .",
    "the pasta phase was calculated at zero temperature within thomas - fermi and compared with results obtained in a simplified approach , the coexistence phases ( cp ) @xcite . due to the approximate way",
    "the surface is described within the last approach the pasta phase comes out smaller with cp than with tf : as in @xcite we conclude that a correct description of the surface energy and its dependence on the isospin , temperature and geometry , is essential to obtain better results using the cp formalism .",
    "the effect of including the @xmath0-meson was also explicitly investigated : together with ddh@xmath0 and gdfm we have also considered nl3@xmath0 .",
    "it was seen that models with the same description of the isoscalar channel and the same symmetry energy at the saturation density , namely the couple ( nl3 , nl3@xmath0 ) , showed a smaller non - homogeneous phase for asymmetric matter when the @xmath0 meson was included .",
    "this effect does not occur for the couple ( tw , ddh@xmath0 ) because although both have the same description of the isoscalar channel , the symmetry energy of the ddh@xmath0 at saturation is smaller . as a result , the extension of the non - homogeneous phase within the ddh@xmath0 model is the largest one for @xmath2-equilibrium stellar matter and is larger than the corresponding non - homogeneous phase within the tw model .",
    "results were compared with previous studies done within nlwm and the predictions obtained from the analysis of the thermodynamical and dynamical spinodals .",
    "one of the main conclusions is that density dependent hadronic models generally predict larger non - homogeneous phases for asymmetric matter than nlw models .",
    "in fact , for @xmath2-equilibrium matter a similar conclusion had been taken in @xcite only from the analysis of the crossing of the @xmath2-equilibrium eos with the dynamical spinodal .",
    "recent parametrizations of the skyrme force , e.g. sly230a , nrapr or lns , showed a similar behavior @xcite .",
    "we confirm this behavior both within the cp and the tf calculation .",
    "one important conclusion obtained at @xmath51 mev is the fact that the transition density for @xmath2-equilibrium matter obtained within a tf calculation almost coincides with the prediction from the dynamical spinodal .",
    "this fact should be confirmed at finite temperature .",
    "however , for symmetric matter or for isospin asymmetries not much smaller that @xmath74 , the tf transition density is larger than the prediction of the dynamical spinodal .",
    "this proton fraction is of particular interest for neutrino trapped matter for which @xmath76 . in this case",
    "a complete equilibrium calculation should be done .",
    "the parametrisation gdfm has a very special behavior with an instability region larger than all the other models , for quite symmetric matter .",
    "however , for very asymmetric matter the instability region is smaller than the one of other ddh models and is of the order of the nlw models .",
    "another important conclusion drawn in the present work is the dependence of the pasta phase extension on the isospin asymmetry . for the nlwm",
    "it is seen clearly that the pasta phase extension decreases if the isospin asymmetry decreases .",
    "for the density dependent models a reduction of the proton fraction from 0.5 to 0.3 almost does not affect the pasta phase or may increase it within the cp calculation and the dynamical spinodal approach . within the dynamical spinodal approach",
    "this behavior is due to the small concavity of the spinodal surface for symmetric matter , and the deformation of the spinodal due to the presence of protons , electrons and the coulomb field .",
    "a smaller fraction of protons contributes with less repulsion and gives a larger instability region .",
    "of course the presence of electrons shields the proton repulsion and therefore the effect is not so strong as it would be for charged matter .",
    "an adequate description of electrons and the coulomb interaction is important to get a correct description of the pasta phase extension . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the largest pasta phase extension occurs when the inclusion of the coulomb field is done in a self - consistent way .",
    "we have checked which parametrisations fulfill the constraints imposed in @xcite for the derivative of the symmetry energy and the transition density and pressure . while the density dependent hadronic models are below the lower limit for the symmetry energy derivative , the nlwm are above the upper limit . however , both nl3 and nl3@xmath0 together with gdfm fall within the transition pressure / density limits while tw and ddh@xmath0 have too large transition densities .",
    "the gdfm parametrization is the one that satisfies the constraints of @xcite more closely .",
    "it seems that the relation between both quantities , the slope of the symmetry energy and the transition density , is not , in fact , model free .",
    "if we had considered the limits on the transition density defined in @xcite , @xmath77 mev/@xmath78 , all models studied here have too small transition pressures except nl3 , that lies just at the lower border , and tw . in @xcite it was shown that a larger slope @xmath79 gives rise to a smaller transition density and transition pressure .",
    "this feature is seen when models within the same framework are considered , namely nl3 and nl3@xmath0 .",
    "however , no clear trend is seen among the ddh models . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the slope of the symmetry energy of the nlw models differs from the one of density dependent hadronic models .",
    "the parametrizations of skyrme forces , like sly230a , nrapr or lns , which have values of @xmath79 at saturation close to the ones of ddh models , also have the transition densities close to the ones of ddh models and above the limit 0.065 @xmath3 imposed in @xcite .",
    "this seems to show that a more complete relation between the transition pressure and transition density and the equilibrium isovector properties of asymmetric nuclear matter have to be obtained .",
    "this could include constraints on the slope and compressibility of the symmetry energy at subsaturation densities .",
    "for instance , the nlw models have positive compressibilities of the symmetry energy at subsaturation densities above 0.05 @xmath3 while the ddh models and the recent skyrme parametrizations have negative compressibilities .",
    "another point which should be referred is that the data obtained from isospin diffusion in heavy - ion reactions correspond to isospin asymmetries that are far from the ones occurring at @xmath2-equilibrium matter . for these large asymmetries",
    "we expect that the contribution from terms beyond the parabolic approximation for the isospin dependence of the energy density of nuclear matter becomes important @xcite .",
