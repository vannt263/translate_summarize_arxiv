    "this is the point where a large scale dependence is totally ignored within the approximation of nonfluctuating distribution function . to keep this dependence one should derive the quasi - equilibrium distribution function in at least the first order approximation in @xmath128 and",
    "allow distribution function to fluctuate .",
    "now we turn to fluctuations . following to onsager principle",
    ", kinetics of a linear non - equilibrium thermodynamical system ( its relaxation to an equilibrium state ) defines fluctuations in the system . in turn , the fluctuations of the thermodynamical entities ( evolution of the time correlation functions of their deviations from equilibrium values ) can be equivalently described in terms of langevin equation with @xmath175-correlated stochastic sources .",
    "thus the fluctuations of equilibrium systems can be viewed as a stationary process with the time scales defined by the relaxation times @xmath176 , @xmath166 , of the gas dynamical stage of the relaxation . as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : hierarchy ] these time scales are known to be much bigger than that of the kinetic relaxation @xmath177 thus providing a local equilibrium framework .",

    ", there is finite number of big systems @xmath181 , @xmath182, ... ,@xmath183 , each making contribution to fluctuation of the temperature with _",
    "different _ relative variances at corresponding time scales @xmath184, ... ,@xmath185 . observed marginal distribution for @xmath142 will depend on the observation time @xmath186 as compared to these time scales .",
    "we remark that the observed relative variance of fluctuating @xmath106 is thus depends on the scale and @xmath186 .    at the time scale",
    "@xmath187 the canonical gibbs distribution makes a very good description of @xmath142 , with @xmath106 treated as a constant , and an additive character of the entropy and mean energy .    at long time scale , @xmath188 , the fluctuations of @xmath106",
    "can not be ignored so that tsallis - like distribution emerges as an effective description , i.e. , we should replace @xmath114 , and make the averaging @xmath189 , with @xmath190 and some relative variance .",
    "this results in a non - additive character of the entropy and mean energy of @xmath142 .",
    "note however that in the latter case the usual quasi - equilibrium ( thermal equilibrium ) still holds for any given value of @xmath8 at the small time scale @xmath176 .",
    "this picture meets that assumed by beck  @xcite .    for @xmath191 ( an ideal thermostat ) , we have @xmath192 so that @xmath106 is constant at any time scale @xmath193 , thus @xmath1 for @xmath194 .    to put the above consideration on solid grounds , below we outline statistical mechanics approach to fluctuations , within a dynamical framework .",
    "we can treat the quasithermostat @xmath178 as an equilibrium system , which can be described in pure additive thermodynamical terms , with the canonical gibbs distribution , @xmath195 $ ] , providing the averaging in @xmath178 .",
    "however , kinetic and thermodynamic fluctuations naturally occur in the quasi - equilibrium system @xmath178 and can be calculated in a _ linear _ approximation ( small fluctuations ) for the case of weak inhomogeneity of the system , eq .",
    "( [ inhomogeneity ] ) .",
    "we notice that rigorous description of fluctuations is out of scope of the canonical gibbs distribution and the one - particle distribution function entering boltzmann equation .    in a dynamical framework , one should consider bogolyubov equations with a short - range interaction potential , @xmath196 , for point - like particles ( providing convergence of the integral for local energy density ) , small density parameter @xmath128 ( i.e. , three- and higher order particle collisions are ignored ) , and weak inhomogeneity ( providing small gradient of the one - particle distribution function ) , and account for the two - particle correlation function with _ a partial relaxation _ of initial correlations .",
    "this implies fluctuations of the one - particle distribution function ; see e.g. @xcite and review @xcite .",
    "the form of the resulting kinetic equations allows one to study separately implications related to brownian effect ( a discrete collision structure of the medium ) thus discarding influence of fluctuations on kinetic processes .",
    "the resulting picture is equivalent to consideration of some langevin equations with @xmath175-correlated stochastic sources , from which one can extract two - point correlation functions and spectral densities of the gas density , velocity , and pressure , for a local equilibrium state . in the local equilibrium approximation correlation functions of the stochastic sources can be found also by phenomenological methods of non - equilibrium thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the spectral densities can be used to estimate the gas dynamical relaxation time , @xmath197 , where @xmath198 is kinematic viscosity , @xmath199 is heat conductivity , and @xmath200 is wave vector . for a finite system of characteristic size @xmath10 ,",
    "the wave vector @xmath200 is naturally bounded from below , @xmath201 , from which with the use of estimation @xmath202 it follows eq .",
    "( [ gasrel ] ) .",
    "we focus on the temperature fluctuations , for which one can obtain the approximate variance , deltat ( t)^2kt^2 ( dt / de)_v , with temperature @xmath99 being normally distributed ( in this approximation ) , and @xmath23 in the r.h.s . is given in terms of equilibrium value .",
    "this means that @xmath99 fluctuates about the average @xmath23 with the relative variance @xmath203 , where @xmath204 is a heat capacity of the quasithermostat @xmath178 , thus ending up with the consideration of sec .  [ sec : fluctuations ] .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the entropy @xmath205 of @xmath178 fluctuates as well , @xmath206 , @xmath207 .",
    "clearly , natural fluctuations occur not only in the quasithermostat @xmath178 but also in the considered smaller system @xmath142 .",
    "however , we can ignore these fluctuations as they make small contribution to specific fluctuation of the temperature @xmath99 governed by the quasithermostat , due to @xmath208 .",
    "we point out that a major difference from the above consideration arises when turning to fully developed turbulence considered in @xcite .",
    "beck used _ statistical _ temperature related to kinetic coefficients ( fluctuations of which are evidently not related to a finiteness of quasithermostat ) and have averaged the probability distribution function ( describing a stationary non - equilibrium state ) derived from a nonlinear langevin equation which is different from the canonical gibbs distribution .",
    "fluctuations of the friction coefficient ( or viscosity ) are seem to be of a kinetic type originating from large scale fluctuations of the phase - space density function averaged over the smallest scale .",
    "such fluctuations may have a big relative variance as they are not related to the particle number of some big system , with the main contribution to the energy dissipation happening at the smallest scale being fluctuations , @xmath209 , where @xmath210 is velocity and @xmath211 is fluctuation of the velocity .",
    "indeed , for kolmogorov ( the smallest ) length scale @xmath212 of the turbulent flow beck has derived under simple assumptions a theoretical value of the entropic parameter , @xmath213 , which essentially deviates from unity ( the relative variance is considerable , @xmath214 ) .",
    "one can see @xcite that tsallis formalism does work in this case as well . for bigger scales , fluctuations of the energy dissipation decrease",
    "so that in zero order approximation in @xmath215 the energy dissipation is constant . clearly , one should assign the value @xmath1 for this large scale asymptotics .",
    "fluctuations of @xmath8 in the canonical gibbs distribution mean that we deal with a _ fluctuating distribution function_. the @xmath5 _ average _ value of this fluctuating distribution function is tsallis distribution , e^-h _ = e_q-1 ^ -h .",
    "the relative variance of this fluctuation is = s_s(1 + ) , where @xmath216 . for small @xmath217",
    ", this relative variance behaves as @xmath218 .",
    "also , up to a first order in @xmath91 , we obtain lin _",
    "q-1[-h ] ( 1 + ^2 h^2 ) .",
    "it is remarkable to note that this function is non - factorizable with respect to @xmath113 because of the presence of @xmath219 .    from the above dynamical consideration",
    "it follows that fluctuations of a probability distribution function arise naturally in studying both equilibrium and non - equilibrium phenomena .",
    "however , in studying equilibrium state one usually uses non - fluctuating distribution function , thus discarding specific effects such as wellknown brownian one .",
    "namely , the @xmath171 approximation means a continuous medium approximation , at which brownian motion can not be described , even for the smallest physical equilibrium system @xmath160 consisting of , e.g. , @xmath164 particles for @xmath220 .",
    "in contrast , the use of a phenomenological tsallis approach makes possible to account for some of the effects related to natural fluctuations of an equilibrium distribution function or that corresponding to a stationary non - equilibrium process .    finally , we point out that even _ small _ fluctuations of the one - particle distribution function , @xmath221 , make an essential contribution ( as big as boltzmann integral which is treated as a leading term ) to boltzmann equation with langevin sources @xcite .",
    "this indicates importance of accounting for fluctuations of probability distribution functions , both for equilibrium and non - equilibrium states , at some scales .",
    "the microcanonical approach in the form presented in this paper evidently can not cover a universal character of tsallis formalism .",
    "first , since we assume @xmath222 the parameter @xmath64 is very close to zero that allows us to use expansion in @xmath64 and calculate small corrections to the canonical gibbs distribution , while for considerable @xmath64 the arguments of our derivation in sec .",
    "[ sec : quasi ] break down .",
    "second , we have ignored the interaction energy @xmath154 that is not valid for systems with long - range microscopic interactions to which tsallis statistics is applied .",
    "also , the nonextensivity can arise not only as the effect of a finite heat bath .",
    "for example , tsallis distribution arises in the description of polydispersed colloids with the fluctuating parameter being particle size @xcite , and was used to describe statistical properties of fully developed turbulence @xcite ; see also review in @xcite .",
    "in general , fluctuations of the parameter @xmath8 ( or statistical temperature ) and averaging of the fluctuating distribution function over @xmath5-like distribution can be viewed as a defining feature of tsallis - like nonextensive statistical distributions , regardless to the origin of fluctuations .    adopting this viewpoint",
    ", one can try various types of distribution of @xmath8 in replace of @xmath5 distribution , and allow considerable relative variance of @xmath8 .",
    "for example , it is natural to assume poisson distribution for the random momenta @xmath97 in replace of the normal distribution ; see also @xcite .",
    "also , one may be interested in a more detailed description and account for higher order momenta such as biquadratic deviations of  @xmath8 .    from this point of view",
    ", tsallis formalism can be treated as a suitable universal tool to deal with fluctuating distribution functions without turning to underlying kinetic issues .",
    "however , it should be noted that the use of an _ averaged _ fluctuating distribution function means _",
    "incomplete _ statistical description .",
    "finally , we stress that the very notions of extensivity ( additivity ) and intensivity in thermodynamics are essentially based on the requirement that the system is homogeneous , which is provided for big systems with weak interactions or , more precisely , in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath223 , @xmath224 const .",
    "these notions make no strict sense for inhomogeneous systems such as finite systems or systems characterized by the size of the order of correlation length @xmath225 . as a consequence ,",
    "in this case there is no thermodynamical equivalence between equilibrium microcanonical and canonical ensembles .",
