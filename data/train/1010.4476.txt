    "singlet phase in low fields below the 1/8 magnetization plateau and the 1/2 plateau .",
    "we have found that the dimer - singlet phase remains a good variational ground state in the so - called high temperature phase , where the only anisotropy , that takes on a finite but small value , is the inter - dimer interaction @xmath185 perpendicular to the cubo@xmath5 planes , and the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane .",
    "this phase is surrounded by gapless phases with an @xmath66 symmetry where , due to @xmath185 , the triplons can propagate with a well - defined dispersion .    in the less symmetrical , low - temperature structure of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 , the finite intra - dimer dm interaction @xmath127 appears and it gives rise to admixture of triplet components and the singlet states in the variational wave function of the ` dimer - singlet ' phase , without any symmetry breaking ( we denoted this phase as @xmath403 $ ] ) .",
    "the finite @xmath127 not only removes the @xmath66 degeneracy in the gapless phases , but also introduces frustration depending on the sign of @xmath185 ; in the unfrustrated case there is a crossover from the @xmath66 phase to @xmath404 $ ] where there is a preferred direction in the @xmath66-plane set by @xmath127 , while in the frustrated case an ising like @xmath165-symmetry breaking appears .",
    "this is a similar behavior that has been seen in ladders@xcite and square antiferromagnets@xcite with dm interactions .",
    "we also studied the effect of the anisotropies on the excitation spectra . for that purpose",

    "we have recovered the momentum - dependent splitting of the triplet states , in accordance with the neutron - scattering experiments .",
    "furthermore , we have also recovered the experimentally measured esr spectra for a physically reasonable set of parameters . in this respect ,",
    "we note the followings when comparing to the usual perturbational approach , where a single triplet excitation propagates@xcite : ( i ) in order to describe the spectra in the field that is parallel to the cubo@xmath5-plane the inclusion of all the triplet states is needed ; ( ii ) the finite - field gap in the perturbational approach is proportional to the @xmath127 , while in the bond wave approach it is proportional to @xmath312 , thus a smaller value of @xmath127 can already lead to observable effects .",
    "regarding the esr line intensities , we have found that in the high - symmetry case , the weight in the spin - structure factor appears in the @xmath66 phases and is concentrated on the line that is split from the @xmath405 triplet excitation , and , loosely speaking , follows the  paramagnetic \" esr line . in the low - symmetry case , the anisotropies make the dimer singlet@xmath66 quantum critical point a crossover , and the weight accordingly appears at the energies of the order of the zero - field singlet - triplet gap .",
    "this large weight is clearly observed in the esr spectra in the 15 - 25 t range at 700ghz and above .",
    "finally , let us mention the main disadvantage of the bond - wave method .",
    "namely , keeping only the quadratic terms in the boson operators , the dispersion due to @xmath2 is not taken into account , and similarly , the @xmath2 term does not decrease the singlet - triplet gap from its bare value @xmath406 ( for that we need to go to higher orders in the @xmath119 expansion and to introduce terms with four bosons ) .",
