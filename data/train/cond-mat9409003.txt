    "polyampholytes ( pas ) are long chain macromolecules with a random mixture of oppositely charged groups fixed along their backbone@xcite .",
    "several elements conspire to make the behavior of such heteropolymers a problem of great interest .",
    "one ( admittedly somewhat remote ) motivation is the similarity to the macromolecules of biological interest such as nucleic or amino acids .",
    "the specific sequence of monomers on such chains is essential to biological activity .",
    "for example , the sequence of amino acids determines the ultimate shape of a protein@xcite . attempting to unravel the precise factors responsible for _ protein folding _ , several statistical models have been proposed@xcite .",
    "these models sacrifice the specifity of particular proteins , by essentially focusing on generic properties of heteropolymers with competing interactions@xcite .",
    "pas can be regarded as a particular example of this class . from another perspective",
    ", properties of random systems with competing interactions has been on the forefront of statistical mechanics for the past decade@xcite .",
    "the prototype of complexity in this class of problem , the spin glass , has much in common with random heteropolymers .",
    "the statistics of the ground state , and those of low lying excitations , is paramount to both systems . as examples of _ soft _ condensed matter , heteropolymers have the advantage of faster relaxation , compared to their  harder \" counterparts .",
    "indeed there is much encouragement from recent experimental studies of solutions@xcite and gels composed of pas@xcite .",
    "it may appear that the long range nature of the coulomb interaction between charges is yet an additional complication of an already hard problem . yet for a uniformly charged a polymer ( a polyelectrolyte ) , it is possible to find the _",
    "exact _ scaling of the radius of gyration @xmath4 on the number of monomers @xmath1@xcite .",
    "the proof relies on the non - renormalization of the dimensionless interaction parameter @xmath5 in @xmath6 embedding dimensions . since @xmath7",
    ", it follows that @xmath8 , with @xmath9 ( for @xmath10 ) .",
    "inspired by the simplicity of the homogeneous case , we suggested a similar argument for the randomly charged pa@xcite .",
    "consider a model pa composed of @xmath1 charges @xmath2 , randomly and independently chosen at each site .",
    "although the mean net charge is zero , a typical pa has excess charge of order @xmath11 .",
    "independent of its sign , this leads to a repulsive self energy , on average described by the dimensionless parameter @xmath12 . assuming that this parameter is not renormalized as in the uniformly charged case leads to a swelling exponent of @xmath13 ( for @xmath14 ) , i.e. a polymer that is _ stretched _ in @xmath15 .",
    "however , in an electrolytic solution oppositely charged ions rearrange so as to screen the long range coulomb interaction .",
    "the net effect is an attractive energy@xcite , described by the debye ",
    "hckel ( dh ) theory .",
    "higgs and joanny@xcite , assumed that the monomers in a pa can similarly rearrange to _ compact _ configurations , thereby taking advantage of the dh attraction .",
    "a partial resolution of the contradiction between the two predictions is obtained by noting that dh theory requires the exact neutrality of the electrolyte , while the rg ",
    "inspired approach depends on the excess charge in a typical sequence .",
    "monte carlo simulations@xcite indeed confirm that pas with @xmath16 compactify at low temperatures .",
    "by contrast sampling all random quenches with unrestricted @xmath0 produces a broad range of sizes , with an average consistent with @xmath17 .    depending on the conditions ,",
    "experiments observe both compact and expanded conformations@xcite .",
    "one set of experiments@xcite were performed on gels produced by crosslinking pas@xcite . by changing the conditions of the solvent ( ph , salt content , etc . ) , it is possible to control both the excess charge @xmath0 on the pa chains , and the screening length . due to the large screening length ,",
    "the coulomb interactions are significant . as a function of @xmath0 , the gel undergoes dramatic changes in volume ; the neutral gel being the most compact .",
    "however , the volume of the gel does not change gradually with increasing charge .",
    "there is an interval of @xmath0 around the neutral point where the gel remains compact , suddenly increasing in volume by a order of magnitude beyond a threshold @xmath18 .",
    "the threshold scales with the number of monomers @xmath1 , within a screening length as @xmath19 .",
    "motivated by the experimental results , we undertook a systematic examination of the dependence of the size of a pa on its excess charge .",
    "monte carlo simulations show that pas are compact for small @xmath0 , and expanded when @xmath0 exceeds a critical value of @xmath20 , in complete analogy with the experiments",
    ". some aspects of this transition can be understood by analogy to the behavior of a charged drop .",
    "the spherical drop is stable for charges smaller than a rayleigh limit @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the volume of the drop .",
    "charged beyond this point , the drop elongates to minimize the coulomb repulsion .",
    "the elongated drop rapidly disintegrates into smaller droplets . in attempting to follow a similar scenario , a pa chain breaks into a necklace of globules connected by strings .",
    "the detailed shape of the necklace is determined by charge inhomogeneities .",
    "the main results of this work were summarized in an earlier publication@xcite . here",
    "we provide more detailed results and additional information .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the competing arguments applied to pas are discussed in some detail in section [ secgen ] , and their inconsistencies are emphasized .",
    "the results of monte carlo simulations on the dependence of the radius of gyration of the polymer on temperature and excess charge are presented in section [ sectdep ] .",
    "various details of the monte carlo procedure are relegated to appendix [ mc ] .",
    "we argue that as @xmath0 is increased beyond a threshold @xmath18 , the pa undergoes a sudden transition from a compact to a strongly elongated state . in section [ secqdep ]",
    "we provide a qualitative picture of this transition by analogy to the shape instability of a charged drop .",
    "some known results pertaining to such drops , as well as new calculations for spheroidal shapes are presented in appendix [ secchdrop ] .",
    "such analogies can not be extended to the strongly distorted limit where , as argued in section [ secstrong ] , a uniformly charged polymer deforms into a necklace of compact beads .",
    "such a shape is the best compromise for the pa in trying to mimic the ground state of a charged drop , which as described in the appendix [ secground ] , is obtained by splitting into several droplets . in section [ secbeyond ]",
    "we point out the importance of quenched randomness in the pa .",
    "an ordered necklace is not stable to charge inhomogeneities , and the beads must rearrange in complicated shapes dependent on the details of randomness .",
    "in this work we consider pas immersed in a good solvent in which the concentration of counterions is small , and hence the electrostatic interactions are treated as unscreened .",
    "experimentally , the details of a charge sequence are determined by its fabrication process .",
    "_ markovian _ sequences are constructed by adding one monomer at a time , the probability of choosing a particular monomer ( e.g. positively or negatively charged ) depends only on the last monomer@xcite .",
    "such a construction leads to correlations in the charges @xmath23 , which decay exponentially as , @xmath24 the extreme limits of @xmath25 and @xmath26 correspond to _ non - random _ sequences that are alternating@xcite , or fully charged , and will not be considered here .",
    "the behavior for @xmath27 is asymptotically similar to the case where the charges are uncorrelated ( @xmath28 ) , and we shall focus mostly on such chains .",
    "we shall , however , allow for the possibility that the total charge of the chain is constrained to a particular value of @xmath0 .",
    "experimentally , this net charge can be controlled by changing the ph , and other properties of the solvent . at several points",
    "we shall also contrast the behavior of _ quenched _ and _ annealed _ pas ; the latter is defined a predetermined collection of positive and negative charges which can freely move along the polymer chain . note that in this definition the total charge is fixed .",
    "if this constraint is also removed the polymer lowers its energy by getting rid of any excess charge .",
    "note that such annealed pas are not very realistic , and should not be confused with the case considered by raphael and joanny@xcite , where the excess charge can adjust its value depending on the temperature , concentration of pas and concentration of the counterions .",
    "a short @xmath29monomer segment of a pa with uncorrelated random monomers has typical charge of @xmath30 .",
    "if we assume that the segment is a self  avoiding walk , its radius of gyration is approximately @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a microscopic length ( e.g. the monomer diameter or nearest neighbor separation along the chain ) . as the typical electrostatic energy of such",
    "a subchain is @xmath33 , interactions become important for @xmath34 .",
    "( we shall henceforth measure temperature in energy units , i.e. set @xmath35 . ) alternatively , we can define @xmath36 , and divide the entire chain into segments of @xmath37 monomers .",
    "the interactions within each segment are small compared with @xmath38 , while interactions between the segments are strong .",
    "such segments form the basic  ions \" in an analogy@xcite between pas and usual electrolytes@xcite employed by higgs and joanny@xcite .",
    "the spatial extent of each segment is @xmath39    for the generalized markovian chains , the net charge of a sufficiently long segment ( such that @xmath40 ) grows as @xmath41 .",
    "the previous argument thus remains valid after replacing @xmath42 by @xmath43 .",
    "this simple change is sufficient to relate most high temperature properties of the short - range correlated sequences to the uncorrelated ones ( e.g. in a high temperature series expansion for the radius ) .    in the spirit of an rg analysis , we can attempt to increase the short distance cutoff along the sequence by a factor @xmath29 .",
    "perturbations around the high temperature phase depend on the _ dimensionless _ interaction parameter @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a typical charge on length ",
    "scale @xmath29 , while @xmath46 is the spatial extent of the shortest segments . upon rescaling the cutoff by a factor @xmath47",
    ", @xmath45 increases by @xmath48 , while @xmath46 scales by @xmath49 , as in a self  avoiding walk .",
    "thus , the renormalized interaction parameter , @xmath50 grows under rescaling and reaches unity for @xmath29 equal to @xmath37 defined above . at this scale @xmath46",
    "becomes of the same order as @xmath51 . beyond this point",
    "the interactions are _ relevant _ , strongly modifying the behavior of the chain .",
    "different approaches to the problem are in agreement in the weak coupling regime of @xmath52 .",
    "the strong coupling regime is not easily tractable , and different assumptions lead to different conclusions .",
    "higgs and joanny@xcite construct the free energy of a long pa by first assuming that it has a uniform density and then proving this assumption self - consistently .",
    "( see also refs .",
    "@xcite . ) in this approach the @xmath1monomer pa is divided into blobs@xcite of @xmath37 monomers each , forming a liquid of uniform density as depicted qualitatively in fig .",
    "the blobs are non  interpenetrating and arranged so that the neighborhood of each blob is predominantly occupied by blobs of opposite charge .",
    "this arrangement roughly resembles the structure of a salt crystal .",
    "the excess charge of each blob is effectively screened and the dense configurations take energetic advantage of the large number of neighbors of opposite sign .",
    "the energy gain per blob is approximately the nearest neighbor interaction , i.e. @xmath53 .",
    "we note , however , that even in the ideal nacl crystal , the condensation energy per atom ( @xmath54 ) is a small fraction of the interaction energy between the nearest neighbors ( @xmath55 ) , and is thus strongly influenced by further neighbors . the validity of the picture depicted in fig .",
    "[ figo]a rests on the assumption that it is possible to fold a randomly charged object in a way that not only provides the correct neighborhood to each charge , but also keeps more extended neighborhoods approximately neutral .",
    "thus such configurations require the possibility of specific foldings of the pa at both local and global levels .",
    "the primary focus of the dh  type approach is the minimization of the extensive part of the energy by creating a homogeneous liquid  like structure , while non  extensive energies due to surface tension and electrostatics are relegated the role of determining the overall shape of the globule . by contrast , an rg  inspired approach@xcite to the problem assumes that the blobs form a _ self  similar _ structure ( as depicted in fig .",
    "[ figo]b ) which attempts to take care of energies on every length  scale . in @xmath6 space dimensions , the dimensionless interaction parameter at scale",
    "@xmath29 is @xmath56 .",
    "this expression represents the typical interaction energy of a random @xmath29monomer segment , _ assuming _ that the coulomb interactions can not be screened . for a self  similar structure with @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and",
    "the interaction parameter grows or diminishes under rescaling unless @xmath59 .",
    "( the analogous argument leads to the exact value of @xmath60 for uniform polyelectrolytes where no screening is possible@xcite . )",
    "this result is valid only for @xmath61 : for @xmath62 the electrostatic interactions are irrelevant and @xmath63 , while for @xmath64 the polymer is stretched ( @xmath65 ) . keeping interactions equally strong on all length",
    " scales also generates a condensation energy propotional to @xmath66 .",
    "however , as this argument does not provide the prefactor , i.e. the actual value of the condensation energy , it is not possible to deduce whether the dh  type or rg  type ansatz produces the lower free energy state .",
    "are the two aforementioned approaches mutually exclusive ? in this work we present evidence that they actually represent two facets of the same problem : dh  theory attempts to minimize the condensation energy without paying attention to the surface .",
    "however , an object can be ( locally ) `` compact '' and still have an extremely extended shape which is controlled by the non  extensive part of the energy . the rg  inspired approach attempts to accommodate the latter energy .",
    "configurations of a polymer are completely specified by listing the position verctors @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) of its monomers .",
    "the shape and spatial extent of the polymer are roughly characterized by the shape tensor , @xmath69 where the greek indices denote the cartesian components of the vectors .",
    "thermal averages of the ordered eigenvalues @xmath70 of this tensor ( sometimes referred to as moments of inertia ) are used to describe the mean size and shape ; their sum , i.e. the thermal average of @xmath71 , is the squared radius of gyration @xmath72 . since we are dealing with sequences of quenched disorder , these quantities",
    "must also be averaged over different realizations . in three dimensions , uniform uncharged polymers in good solvents",
    "are swollen ; their @xmath4 scaling as @xmath73 with @xmath74 as in self  avoiding walks .",
    "polymers in poor solvents are `` compact '' , i.e. described by @xmath75 .",
    "the monte carlo procedure used in this work is identical to that described in ref.@xcite .",
    "here we describe some important features , while the more technical details are described in appendix [ mc ] .",
    "the simulated chains are composed of @xmath1 monomers whose positions are discretized to a cubic lattice ( @xmath15 ) with lattice constant @xmath32 . the connectivity of the polymer is maintained by restricting the maximal distance between neighbors to @xmath76 . the excluded volume interaction is enforced by not allowing two monomers to come any closer than @xmath77 .",
    "each quench is characterized by a set of charges @xmath78 .",
    "the electrostatic interactions between the charges , @xmath79 , is included by assigning energy @xmath80 to each pair @xmath81 at a separation distance @xmath82 , with @xmath83 , which `` softens '' the potential at short distances .",
    "the results of the simulations are parametrized by the chain length @xmath1 , temperature @xmath38 , and the overall excess charge @xmath84 .",
    "each @xmath0 can be obtained by many realizations of randomness , and all results were averaged over 10 different quenches .",
    "however , rather than taking the same configurations through changing temperatures , 10 distinct quenches were used for each @xmath38 and @xmath0 .",
    "the smoothness in variations of various quantities with temperature then provides added confidence in the thermal and quench averaging process .",
    "not surprisingly , as explained in appendix [ mc ] , the overall uncertainties are entirely due to quench averaging as the statistical errors of the thermal averages are smaller than the differences between quenches .",
    "[ figa ] depicts the temperature dependence of @xmath72 for 64monomer chains .",
    "the number near each curve indicates the charge , @xmath85 . at very high temperatures the electrostatic interactions are unimportant and",
    "the chains behave as self  avoiding walks , with @xmath86 and @xmath74 .",
    "the typical electrostatic energy of such configurations is estimated as @xmath87 where we have employed @xmath88 for @xmath89 , and used @xmath4 as a measure of interparticle separation .",
    "note that the interaction changes sign at @xmath90 this is because the energy of strongly charged polymers is dominated by the _ repulsive _ interaction of excess charges .",
    "however , for weakly charged polymers , there is an _ attractive _ interaction between fluctuations in the charge distribution ; the typical fluctuation of @xmath0 leads to the above result .",
    "as temperature of the chain is lowered , the effects of interactions become apparent for @xmath91 chains with charge larger than @xmath18 expand , while those with @xmath92 shrink with decreasing temperature .",
    "the strongest deviation occurs for the fully charged polymer , which for @xmath93 starts at @xmath94 . for @xmath16 ,",
    "the deviation begins at the much lower temperature of @xmath95 .",
    "indeed , on the logarithmic scale of fig . [ figa ]",
    "the departure from the infinite temperature values of @xmath72 is most apparent for @xmath96 , starting at @xmath97 ( beyond the limits of the figure ) , compared to @xmath98 for @xmath16 .    to see if the _ averages _ in fig .  [ figa ] provide a good measure of the pa size at low temperatures , we constructed histograms of the distribution of @xmath72 at @xmath99 for several values of @xmath0 .",
    "as thermal fluctuations are small , the histograms in fig .",
    "[ figb ] represent differences between quenches .",
    "the distributions are fairly narrow , their widths not exceeding the distance between their averages .",
    "thus a point in fig .",
    "[ figa ] provides a good measure of @xmath100 , independent of further details of the sequence .",

    ", we found a very broad distribution for @xmath103 . even in sampling a few quenches",
    ", there were several completely collapsed , and some strongly stretched configurations .",
    "[ figf ] shows the spatial conformations of several quenches examined in this study .",
    "the weakly charged configurations for @xmath104 or 4 are spherical globules , indistinguishable from each other .",
    "the chains are slightly expanded for @xmath105 , while for @xmath106 , a value of only twice @xmath18 , they are strongly stretched .",
    "it can now be appreciated that the previously observed breadth of the distribution for @xmath103 simply follows from the strong dependence of @xmath72 on @xmath0 rather than indicating a large scatter of @xmath72 amongst different quenches with the same @xmath0 .",
    "the averaged radii of pas in fig .",
    "[ figa ] change monotonically with temperature .",
    "this suggests that compact and extended states are separated in the @xmath107 plane by a straight line starting from @xmath108 at infinite @xmath38 .",
    "this hypothesis was tested by looking at the @xmath0 and @xmath1 dependence of the radius of gyration for chains of lengths @xmath109 , 32 , 64 , 128 . to achieve good thermal averages ,",
    "simulations were performed at @xmath110 and not at the lowest temperature in fig .",
    "the dependence of @xmath72 on @xmath0 is depicted in fig .",
    "the vertical axis is scaled by @xmath111 to remove the @xmath1dependence of the @xmath72 of the compact globules at @xmath16 .",
    "the charges on the horizontal axis are scaled by @xmath112 for all polymer lengths .",
    "although monotonic , @xmath72 exhibits strong variations with @xmath0 .",
    "the radius is barely increasing for small @xmath0 , but an extremely steep rise begins beyond a threshold charge . due to the monotonic increase or decrease of pa sizes with temperature ,",
    "this variation becomes even sharper at low temperatures .",
    "[ figc ] strongly suggests that the transition from compact to stretched configurations at low temperatures still occurs for @xmath113 .",
    "when the distortions of a globular object are small , the changes in @xmath72 are not very sensitive to the changes in shape .",
    "the increase in the largest eigenvalue of the shape tensor @xmath114 due to elongation of the object is partially compensated by a decrease of other eigenvalues .",
    "[ figr ] is analogous to fig .",
    "[ figc ] except that it depicts the charge dependence of the @xmath114 .",
    "the strong elongation of the pa for @xmath115 is also apparent from this figure .",
    "to explain the above results , we start with the empirical observation that pas with vanishing excess charge @xmath0 compactify to spherical `` globules '' of spatial extent @xmath116 and surface area @xmath117 .",
    "it is thus natural to represent the total energy ( or rather the quench  averaged free energy ) of such globules as a sum of condensation and surface energies , @xmath118 the condensation energy is proportional to @xmath119 , while the surface tension is @xmath120 , where the dimensionless prefactor @xmath121 , is found to be rather small@xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that eq.([eq0 ] ) _ is not self  evident _ as it represents the average energy of a _ connected _ chain of @xmath1 monomers with long range interactions , rather than @xmath1 independent particles .",
    "while the existence of an extensive condensation energy is natural , non  extensive corrections may in principle be present without any relation to the surface .",
    "the presense of the surface term is deduced from the numerical observations that the object is approximately spherical .",
    "we may hope that this form of the energy persists as long as the deformations of the globule are not too large .    if we now uniformly add a very small number ( @xmath122 ) of charges along the chain ( e.g. by randomly replacing @xmath123 of negative charges by positive ones ) , without modifying the spatial conformation of the pa , its total energy increases approximately by @xmath124 , representing the sum of changes in _ local _ interactions . for moderate charges ( @xmath125 )",
    "the energy increase is dominated by the long range interactions and is of order @xmath126 .",
    "if the pa is now allowed to relax , it will lower its energy by finding more favorable configurations , and thus , @xmath127 the above considerations are equally applicable to a charged drop , and we shall explore such analogies to treat weakly distorted pas . in the following paragraphs , we initially review the results pertaining to the shape of a charged _ conducting _ drop . this analogy is most appropriate for an annealed version of the problem in which the charges are free to move along the polymer chain .",
    "we then go on to consider the shape of a charged _ insulating _ drop of immobile charges , which is a better representation of quenched pas .    for a _ conducting _ drop all the charge accumulates on the surface .",
    "the non  extensive contribution to the energy of a freely suspended spherical drop of radius @xmath128 is @xmath129 however , the drop can change shape to minimize the sum of surface tension and coulomb energies .",
    "the surface energy of an uncharged drop , @xmath130 , sets the overall energy scale of the problem while the dimensionless parameter , @xmath131 determines its shape",
    ". we shall refer to @xmath132 as the _ rayleigh charge _ of the drop .",
    "note that the estimates of @xmath133 and @xmath128 following eq .",
    "( [ eq0 ] ) for the model pa lead to @xmath134 .",
    "let us initially consider only small deformations in shape of a single drop .",
    "investigations of the shape of charged liquid drops go back at least to the last century@xcite .",
    "some of the several variants of this problem are : ( a ) a freely suspended charged conducting drop@xcite ; ( b ) an uncharged conducting drop in an external electric field@xcite ; ( c ) a dielectric drop embedded in a different dielectric liquid in an external electric field@xcite .",
    "the last problem has received recent attention because it is mathematically identical to that of a drop of magnetic fluid in a magnetic field@xcite .",
    "the conducting drop is the limiting case of an insulating drop with infinite dielectric constant .",
    "problems ( a ) and ( b ) are strongly related since similar shape instabilities are induced by both the external field , and by the internally generated field of a charged drop .",
    "in fact , in many experimental situations ( see , e.g. ref.@xcite ) , the drop is suspended from a tube .",
    "creating instabilities by raising the potential of the tube is intermediate between the idealized situations described by ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the stability conditions in experiments are usually discussed from the point of view@xcite of increasing potential rather than charge .",
    "therefore , many features of the problem which are of interest to our study are usually not addressed . in the appendix [ secchdrop ]",
    "we summarize the relevant aspects from our perspective , while only quoting the main results in this section .",
    "a closely related problem is that of an _ insulating _ uniformly charged drop .",
    "this problem has been considered in the framework of the charged drop model of atomic nuclei ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the non  extensive portion of the energy of a spherical shape is now @xmath135 the similarity between eqs .",
    "( [ esphere ] ) and ( [ eiq ] ) is evident .",
    "as explained in the appendix [ secchdrop ] this similarity persists even for the non  spherical shapes discussed in this section : all results for conducting drops are transformed into results for insulating drops by replacing @xmath136 with @xmath137 .",
    "this analogy , however , does no persist to arbitrary deformations and differences between conducting and insulating models will become apparent in section [ secstrong ] .    if the only allowed deformations of the charged drop are to ellipsoids of rotation ( prolate spheroids ) , the spherical shape remains stable until @xmath138 reaches 0.899 . at this point",
    "the drop becomes strongly elongated with eccentricity @xmath139 , and continues to stretch with increasing @xmath138 . for large @xmath138 the long axis of the drop ( and",
