    "the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) 1es1959 + 650 is an x - ray peaking bl lacertae object selected from the einstein medium sensitivity survey @xcite .",
    "it is hosted by an elliptical galaxy at a redshift of @xmath4 . according to the unified model of agns , bl lacertae objects have relativistic jets emerging from supermassive black holes accreting at a sub - eddington rate , viewed under a small angle of sight @xcite . with decreasing luminosity",
    ", the peak frequency of the synchrotron emission from the relativistic jets seems to move to higher frequencies . the class of bl lacs in which the synchrotron peak lies in the x - ray regime , are thus called hbls ( high frequency peaked bl lacs ) .",
    "the mass of the central black hole ( bh ) in 1es1959 + 650 has been estimated to be @xmath01.5.10@xmath5  m@xmath6  @xcite , i.e. close to the bh mass of the hbl mkn 421 , the archetype of an extragalactic very high energy gamma - ray ( @xmath7 ) source @xcite .",
    "the first vhe @xmath7 signal from 1es1959 + 650 was reported in 1998 by the seven telescope array in utah , with a 3.9  @xmath1 significance  @xcite . observing the source in 2000 , 2001 , and early 2002 ,",
    "the hegra collaboration reported only a marginal signal  @xcite . in may 2002 , the x - ray flux of the source had significantly increased .",
    "both the whipple  @xcite and hegra  @xcite collaborations subsequently confirmed also a higher vhe @xmath7 flux .",
    "further high @xmath7 activity periods were detected in the same year , with some flares exceeding the crab flux by a factor 2 - 3 .",
    "an interesting aspect of the source activity in 2002 was the observation of a so - called _ orphan flare _",
    "a flare of vhe @xmath7s not accompanied by correlated increased activity at other wavelengths ) , recorded on 4 june by the whipple collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the hegra collaboration had observed another , less significant , orphan vhe signal during moonlight two days earlier  @xcite . both flares in vhe @xmath7s , observed in the absence of high activity in x - rays , are not expected from the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) mechanism in relativistic jets @xcite . for other hbls",
    ", models based on the ssc mechanism @xcite can successfully explain most of the vhe @xmath7 production .",
    "future observations of 1es1959 + 650 , therefore , are of special importance .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : after a brief description of the magic telescope , we present in sect .  [",
    "sect : analysis ] the data analysis using image parameters for gamma - hadron separation , and the reconstruction of the direction and energy of the measured photons .",
    "results are shown in sect .",
    "[ sect : results ] comparing with data from the crab nebula taken around the same time and under similar zenith angles . finally , we discuss in sect .",
    "[ sect : conclusion ] some implications of our findings for vhe emission models and the extragalactic background light .",
    "the magic telescope represents a new generation of imaging air cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) for @xmath7 astronomy .",
    "its design has been optimized to achieve a trigger threshold lower than was possible with previous iacts ( magic eventually is to reach a trigger threshold of 30  gev at zenith ) .",
    "the low threshold will make it an ideal instrument for the study of vhe @xmath7 sources that have spectral cut - offs below 100 - 200  gev , such as pulsars , medium redshift agns , etc .",
    "the magic parameters and performance have been described elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the magic mirror has a diameter and focal length both of 17 m ; its camera comprises 576 hemispherical photo - multiplier tubes with diffuse lacquer coating  @xcite and specially shaped light collectors , both enhancing quantum efficiency .",
    "the camera has a field of view ( fov ) of 3.5@xmath8 .",
    "the magic telescope is located on the canary island of la palma ( 28.2@xmath8n , 17.8@xmath8w , at 2225 m asl ) . from this location ,",
    "1es1959 + 650 is visible from may to october under a zenith angle of 36@xmath8 at culmination . at a mean observation angle of 40@xmath8",
    ", the threshold for the physics analysis is about twice that at zenith .",
    "we present here an analysis down to 180  gev .",
    "past whipple and hegra observations were carried out above 700  gev and above 1  tev , respectively .",
    "the analysis presented here is restricted to @xmath7s with an energy above 180  gev . at such energies",
    ", we can discriminate hadronic and electromagnetic showers using the classical techniques pioneered by the whipple collaboration , described in  @xcite .",
    "the shower image in the camera is parameterized to obtain several test statistics  @xcite describing the image shape and orientation ( also called image parameters or discriminant quantities ) .",
    "the parameters are used to reject hadronic background events by defining , in the space of these parameters , limiting values , _ cuts _ , that discriminate between @xmath7- and hadron - induced images .",
    "the parameters also permit reconstructing the arrival direction and the energy of the original @xmath7 .",
    "table [ tab : rawdata ] shows the summary of the data collected from 1es1959 + 650 , crab nebula , and off - source .",
    "this period in fall 2004 corresponds to the end of the magic commissioning phase .",
    "the zenith angles for these observations are all in the range 36  -  46@xmath9 .",
    "._statistics of the raw data analyzed . _",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : lightcurve ]      strong vhe @xmath7 emission from an agn leads to the question whether the source was active also at other wavelengths .",
    "if the @xmath7 emission is due to the inverse - compton scattering of accelerated electrons , their corresponding synchrotron emission must show up at lower energies .",
    "most observations of other sources are indeed in line with the correlated x - ray variability expected from synchrotron - self - compton models , e.g  @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig : xlightcurve ] and [ fig : olightcurve ] show the light curves of 1es1959 + 650 in the x - ray and optical domains .",
    "the x - ray data are based on published rxte - asm x - ray flux data @xcite , the optical light curve is provided by the tuorla observatory blazar monitoring program @xcite .",
    "no strong activity in x - rays or in the optical was observed during the period of the vhe @xmath7 studies reported here .",
    "this fact and the absence of significant time variability lead to the tentative conclusion that the reported vhe @xmath7 emission of 1es1959 + 650 does not follow the pattern observed in other agns during flaring periods .",
    "future observations over longer periods will shed more light on the nature of the quiescent vhe emission of 1es1959 + 650 ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : conclusion ] below ) .",
    "the spectra for crab and 1es1959 + 650 measured in fall 2004 are shown in fig.[fig : spectrum_1 ] .",
    "both spectra are consistent with a simple power law , albeit with a spectral index smaller than reported at higher energies .",
    "the lines show fits to the spectra between 180  gev and 2  tev corrected for spill - over factors , using as ansatz an unbroken power law ; the fits give slopes of -2.72@xmath30.14 for 1es1959 + 650 and -2.41@xmath30.05 for the crab , respectively .",
    "there is strong evidence of the spectrum of the 1es1959 + 650 being steeper than that of the crab over this energy range .    in fig.[fig : spectrum_2 ] we show a comparison with spectral data taken by hegra in 2002 at higher energies @xcite , with a slope of -3.18@xmath30.17 .",
    "the energy overlap of past and current data is small , demonstrating the progress in accessing lower energies with the magic telescope .",
    "past spectral descriptions required a cut - off parameter of about 3  tev , in order to take into account possible absorption due to the cosmic infrared background .",
    "our data are in an energy range where the effects of such an absorption process are weak , thus a simple power law should be sufficient to describe the data .",
    "the hbl 1es1959 + 650 has been clearly detected with the magic telescope , in a few hours observation time during september and october 2004 , at a mean zenith angle of  40@xmath8 . during that period ,",
    "the source was in a quiescent state both in x - rays and at optical wavelengths .",
    "in the same period , crab nebula and off - source data were recorded under comparable observational conditions .    for the first time , 1es1959 + 650 has been observed down to 180  gev , a limit much lower than achieved in previous experiments .",
    "the energy spectrum between 180  gev and 2  tev is compatible with a power law of slope -2.72@xmath30.14 .",
    "a crude variability analysis over the period of observation has shown no significant variation of the @xmath7 flux .",
    "the quiescent spectrum can be considered to match the spectrum measured by hegra at higher energy during past periods of equally low x - ray activity .",
    "we therefore tentatively conclude that a steady vhe emission component has been identified in the spectrum of 1es1959 + 650 .",
    "egret has observed @xcite a diffuse @xmath7 spectrum ( a part of the extragalactic background light , or ebl ) in the energy range 100  mev - 100  gev .",
    "the question arises if emission from multiple vhe @xmath7 sources of the 1es1959 type in a low state of activity could produce such a spectrum , when extrapolated to higher energies .",
    "one can estimate that about 400 such sources would be needed .",
    "no complete hbl catalogue for the entire sky exists , but this number of hbls at redshift @xmath10 can be expected from the emss @xcite on a purely statistical basis",
    ". however , their mean x - ray flux is much lower than that of 1es1959 + 650 . adopting the observed vhe / x - ray spectral index of @xmath11 for the quiescent spectrum",
    ", the cumulative vhe flux of hbls would thus be insufficient to explain the observed diffuse @xmath7 spectrum . in agreement with this finding ,",
    "the sky positions of high energy photons ( @xmath12  gev ) observed with egret do not generally coincide with the positions of hbls @xcite , indicating that other contributions to the ebl may also be important @xcite . in this context",
    "it should be noted that more measurements of other @xmath7-emitting agns during periods of low x - ray activity would be important to shed light on these questions .    explaining the observed quiescence spectrum by a one - zone ssc model is possible , but with some difficulty , since the implied relativistic electron pressure exceeds the magnetic pressure , leading to an unstable situation .",
    "ssc models , on the other hand , clearly fall short of explaining the orphan flares seen in previous observations of 1es1959 + 650 @xcite . the quiescence spectrum and the flares both seem to indicate the presence of an additional high energy electron population , possibly of hadronic origin @xcite , or proton synchrotron radiation @xcite .",
    "short variability time scales might reflect dynamical effects in shock - in - jet models , or the short cooling times of protons at ultra - high ( up to 10@xmath13  ev ) energies @xcite .",
    "multi - wavelength monitoring campaigns are required to further reveal the nature of the vhe emission component in 1es1959 + 650 .",
    "such monitoring should also include future large neutrino observatories : the models based on the presence of a significant hadronic component of the 1es1959 + 650 jet , e.g.  @xcite , predict in a natural way also detectable neutrino fluxes .",
    "the amanda collaboration , operating a neutrino telescope in the southern hemisphere , recently reported five recorded neutrino events from the direction of 1es1959 + 650 , over a total observation period of four years @xcite .",
    "three events coincided with 1es1959 + 650 flares ; one is coincident with the orphan flare observed by the whipple collaboration .",
    "while these observations are tantalizing , but not yet statistically compelling , they do demonstrate that neutrino astronomy has reached the stage at which fluxes at the level of the @xmath7 fluxes observed with iacts can be probed . even for neutrino - to-@xmath7 ratios smaller than unity",
    ", icecube should soon provide the necessary experimental sensitivity @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank the iac for the excellent working conditions on the la palma observatory roque de los muchachos . the support of the german bmbf and mpg , the italian infn and the spanish cicyt is gratefully acknowledged .",
