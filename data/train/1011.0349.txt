    "two - photon absorption ( tpa ) is the simultaneous absorption of either two photons from a single beam of light or two single photons from two beams which results in a resonant transition from the ground state to an excited state .",
    "a key feature of tpa is that it allows access to electronic states that are otherwise dipole - forbidden single - photon transitions .",
    "it also represents one of the simplest nonlinear processes that allows one to characterize the strength of the light - matter interaction and to generate novel non - classical effects . as a result",
    ", tpa processes have also been widely studied for various nonlinear and quantum optical phenomena with applications in precision spectroscopy  @xcite , the generation of single photons  @xcite , the measurement of coherence and photon statistics  @xcite , and all - optical switching  @xcite .    for many of the aforementioned applications , a significant amount of tpa",
    "is desired at low power levels .",
    "alkali atoms have large two - photon cross - sections due to near - resonant enhancement from the intermediate state and the high oscillator strengths of the transitions involved  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , previous tpa experiments in bulk alkali vapor cells still required relatively high powers to generate measurable effects  @xcite .",
    "one appoach to significantly reduce the threshold for observing tpa is to use waveguide geometries such as hollow - core photonic band - gap fibers ( pbgf ) filled with an alkali vapor since it provides tight confinement of the light in a single mode over extended distances enabling strong light - matter interactions and high nonlinearities at ultra - low power levels  @xcite .",
    "recently , non - degenerate resonant tpa experiments at nanowatt power levels were performed in tapered optical fibers with ambient thermal rubidium ( rb ) vapor , in which the light - matter interaction occurs via the evanescent wave of the guided light in the fiber  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown previously that a rb - pbgf system can provide large optical depths ( ods ) using light - induced atomic desorption ( liad )  [ ] . however , the tight confinement of atoms and photons give rise to additional spectroscopic features such as transit - time broadening which must be taken into account and has been studied previously in our system  [ ] .    in this paper",
    "we describe the experimental observation of efficient , doppler - free tpa in a rb - pbgf system using the @xmath0 two - photon transition at 778.1 nm at milliwatt power levels .",
    "we estimate theoretically the amount of tpa for our system ( both from direct absorption from the pump beam and from the emitted blue fluorescence ) and show that our experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions . from our measurements",
    "we obtain an estimate of the transit - time of the rb atoms in the pbgf .",
    "we extend our calculations to show how tpa can be further enhanced using a non - degenerate , on - resonance scheme .",

    "once excited to the @xmath3 level , the rb atoms decay with 35% probability to the intermediate @xmath4 level , and then with 31% probability back to @xmath5 ground state emitting blue photons at 420.3 nm ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : level_scheme ] )  [ ] . when the pump beam ( at 778.1 nm ) is far detuned from the intermediate level , or when @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the linewidth of the intermediate level , then the process is termed off - resonant two - photon excitation .",
    "we characterize the nonlinearity of the rb - pbgf system for this process by calculating the imaginary part of the third - order susceptibility @xmath8  @xcite corresponding to the relevant two - photon transition using , @xmath9 where _ n _ is the atomic number density , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the dipole moments for the @xmath12 and @xmath13 transitions , respectively , @xmath2 is the detuning from the @xmath14 level , and @xmath15 is the homogeneous decay rate of the @xmath3 level . in the rb - pbgf system , @xmath15 is determined by the transit time of the atoms across the micron - scale core of the fiber , which is much smaller than the excited state lifetime  [ ] .",
    "the tpa coefficient is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the wavelength of the pump in cm .",

    "there are two possible decay mechanisms involved in the process .",
    "the first is due to a radiative decay from the @xmath3 level , which has a lifetime @xmath39 of @xmath18240 ns , and the second is due to a non - radiative decay resulting from collisions with the walls of the fiber with a lifetime ( transit - time,@xmath40 ) of 6 ns .",
    "effectively , the fraction of atoms that fluoresce is @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the decay path from @xmath42 ( wavelength , @xmath43 389.05 nm ) involves the intermediate level @xmath4 .",
    "hence we must also take into account the energy lost in the @xmath44 transition .",

    "we next consider tpa with counter - propagating beams at 778.1 nm such that tpa occurs by the simultaneous absorption of one photon from each of the beams .",
    "the advantage of using a counter - propagating scheme is that the interaction is doppler free  @xcite .",

    "the beam from an external cavity diode laser at 778.1 nm , scanning mode - hop free across 5 ghz ( over the two - photon resonances ) , is split into two counter - propagating beams using a 50/50 beam splitter ( bs ) and are each coupled to opposite ends of the fiber using 10x objectives .",
    "the two beams have equal powers and identical polarizations .    to generate the desired od ( @xmath57 ) , a highly off - resonant 20-mw desorption beam at 805 nm is also coupled into the fiber with a polarization orthogonal with respect to the pump beams .",
    "the design of our chamber enables us to collect a part of the emitted blue photons from the top .",
    "the blue photons are filtered using a blue colored glass filter and detected by a photomultiplier tube ( pmt , hamamatsu h7422p-40 ) .",

    "[ sec : theory ] , the relatively short transit time of the rb atoms in comparison to the lifetime of the excited @xmath3 level suppresses the number of blue photons emitted , and we estimate the total amount of blue fluorescence emitted from the fiber taking into account the collection area of the pmt and assuming the fluorescence to be isotropic over the @xmath65 solid angle .",

    "we also note that the homogeneous linewidth ( which is determined by transit - time broadening ) is slightly different from system ( rb - pbgf ) to system  [ ]",
    ". this might be due to the fact that desorption ( which is used to generate the rb vapor ) occurs at a slightly different power levels and hence the corresponding temperatures and therefore the thermal velocities of the rb vapor are slightly different .",
    "nevertheless , the amount of off - resonance two - photon absorption is substantially high for such low pump powers , which demonstrates the potential of the rb - pbgf system for exploring novel classical and quantum nonlinear effects at low powers . if we perform an on - resonance non - degenerate tpa  [ ] , using the level scheme shown in fig .",
