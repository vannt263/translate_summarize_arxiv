    "light curves of the w - type w uma eclipsing binary u pegasi by @xcite were converted from differential magnitudes to the standard @xmath1 and @xmath2 systems by addition of the comparison star s magnitudes , @xmath6 , @xmath7 @xcite for bd+14@xmath85078 .",
    "both u peg components are of type g2 @xcite , and an adopted primary star temperature of 5800k was rounded from two values in @xcite .",
    "subsequent work by @xcite refined several velocity points that occur near conjunction .",
    "the light / velocity data were solved simultaneously for distance and other parameters by a version of the wilson - devinney ( w - d ) differential corrections ( dc ) program that contains the direct distance estimation ( dde ) algorithm .",
    "the @xcite parameters were initial input .",
    "however the linear ephemeris @xcite was independently adjusted to improve fits to @xmath2 band light curves and velocity curves , which are separated by 6 years . a solution with primary temperature 5900k was also made to allow parameter interpolation in @xmath9 by readers . adjusted",
    "parameters were inclination ( @xmath10 ) , secondary temperature ( @xmath11 ) , semi - major axis ( @xmath12 ) , potential ( @xmath13 ) , systemic velocity ( @xmath14 ) , mass ratio ( @xmath15 ) , and distance ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "initial solutions that adjusted third light found @xmath17 to be insignificant , so @xmath17 was fixed at zero .",
    "the parameters were split into two dc subsets to reach the solutions of table 1 .",
    "the theory of the dde algorithm , with overviews of simulations , is in @xcite . as applied to 1978 zhai , et al .",
    "light curves and 1984 lu velocity data for u peg , dde yields respective @xmath18 distances of 121.6 and 125.5 pc if @xmath19k .",
    "the formal errors are smaller than the spread , so calibration errors probably account for most of the modest disagreement .",
    "hipparcos parallaxes , as revised by @xcite , span 122 to 175 pc according to the reported @xmath20 errors .",
    "our model light curves might fit the data better if spots were modeled as in @xcite , but derived distance typically is not much affected by such refinement .",
    "although period variations have been linked to a third body by several authors , our solutions indicate that @xmath17 is unlikely to affect distance estimates significantly .",
    "another set of distances will be based on light curves by t. pribulla @xcite and published elsewhere .",
