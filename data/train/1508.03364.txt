    "it is well known that vacuum in quantum field theory ( qft ) is not simply empty space .",
    "rather , it contains short - lived virtual pairs of particle and antiparticle due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "for example , in the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) vacuum , eletron - positron pairs are momentarily created and annihilated . moreover , when an external strong electric field is applied , these virtual particles can be materialized and become real particles .",
    "this is the well known schwinger effect  @xcite .",
    "the production rate per unit time and unit volume @xmath1 has been evaluated long time ago in the weak - coupling and weak - field approximation .",
    "later , it is generalized to arbitrary - coupling but weak - field regime and the result is  @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the charge and mass of the created particles , respectively .",
    "here @xmath5 is the external electric field .",
    "this novel nonperturbative phenomenon can be explained as a tunneling process , and is not unique to qed but usual for qfts coupled to an @xmath6 gauge field .    from the above formula of the production rate ,",
    "it is easy to see that there exists a critical value of the electric field above which the effect is not exponentially suppressed any more and the vacuum becomes catastrophically unstable .",
    "it is interesting to see that there is also a critical electric field ( related to the string tension ) in string theory , above which open strings with opposite charges residing at the two endpoints respectively become unstable  @xcite .",
    "its analogy with the schwinger effect in qfts inspires attempts to realize the latter in the ads / cft context  @xcite .",
    "the first step to achieve this goal is to realize a system coupled with a @xmath6 gauge field . in the best established example of ads / cft , namely the duality between @xmath7 superconformal yang - mill theory ( sym ) and type iib supergravity in @xmath8 ,",
    "this can be realized by breaking the gauge group from @xmath9 to @xmath10 via the higgs mechanism in the cft side . after the breaking",
    ", the fundamental scalar fields in the w - boson supermultiplet , which are often called `` w - bosons '' or `` quarks '' , are coupled to a @xmath6 as well as an @xmath11 gauge field . in the ads side",
    ", this step amounts to separate one @xmath12-brane ( the probe @xmath12-brane ) from the stack of @xmath12-branes . proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also an earlier work  @xcite ) , the probe @xmath12-brane is placed at a finite radial position rather than at the boundary in order to make the mass of w - bosons finite rather than infinitely heavy .",
    "then the exponential factor in the production rate of w - bosons can be evaluated by calculating the classical euclidean action of the string worldsheet which is anchored on a circular wilson loop on the probe @xmath12-brane .",
    "this calculation has been done for pure ads background , and then the critical value of the electric field can be read off which agrees with the one obtained by analyzing the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action .",
    "later , this proposal is generalized to pair - production of other `` particles '' , such as monopole - antimonopole pairs and dyon - antidyon pairs  @xcite , and also to the case with magenetic fields  @xcite .",
    "this calculation is then generalized from pure ads to other interesting backgrounds , more specifically backgrounds describing geometries of ads soliton  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "these backgrounds , according to the ads / cft , are dual to confining phase of qfts  @xcite .",
    "the motivation for studying these confining backgrounds comes from qcd , where quarks are usually in a confining phase and the schwinger effect may provide a new mechanism of a confinement / deconfinement phase transition .",
    "it is expected that the schwinger effect may be observed on rhic and lhc , where collision of heavy ions always induces strong enough electro - magnetic fields . by applying the prescription described above , the production rate of w - bosons",
    "can also be calculated . from the results , it is found that , beyond the usual critical value @xmath13 of the electric field , there exists another threshold @xmath14 below which the schwinger effect can not occur .",
    "this can be seen as a characteristic of confining backgrounds .",
    "these two critical values can also be derived by analyzing the behavior of the potential between w - bosons  @xcite . moreover , by analyzing the behavior of the classical euclidean string action near the two critical values , two universal indexes are found which are independent of the location of the probe @xmath12-brane .",
    "investigations are also extended to the case where the induced metric on the probe brane is curved  @xcite , and to lifshitz and hyperscaling violation geometries  @xcite .",
    "for a recent review on this topic , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    as the holographic setup of the schwinger effect",
    "is closely related to the string theory , it is natural to take into account various stringy corrections . in this paper",
    ", we would like to consider one stringy correction , more specifically , the effect of gauss - bonnet terms whose existence will modify the confining backgrounds . on the field theory side , it amounts to consider the effect of finite ( but large ) t hooft coupling .",
    "we would like to see how this higher - derivative term affects the properties ( the mass for example ) of w - bosons and the schwinger effect .",
    "moreover , it is also interesting to see whether the two universal critical indexes are modified or not .",
    "these are the main motivations of the present work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly introduce the gauss - bonnet soliton background . in sec .",
    "iii , by analyzing the potential between w - bosons holographically , the mass of w - bosons and the two critical values of the electric field are obtained . in sec .",

    "it is well known that the expectation value of the wilson loop is related to the potential between w - bosons @xmath39 ( including the static energy of the pair ) as @xmath40 . on the other hand , according to the ads / cft duality , we have @xmath41 in the classical limit  @xcite , where @xmath42 is the classical string action with the worldsheet anchored on the wilson loop .",
