    "among exotic hadrons , i.e. those which evade classification according to the constituent quark model , glueballs @xcite occupy an extreme position .",
    "in fact , they contain no valence quarks at all and are the only hadrons which would persist in a world without quarks .",
    "even the exclusion of sea quarks from qcd , as in quenched lattice simulations , is not expected to alter their properties drastically .",
    "hence glueball structure provides a unique source of information on nonperturbative gluon dynamics and may even shed light on the often elusive gluon component of the light classical hadrons ( and potentially hybrids ) . a suggestive way to access",
    "this information is to investigate the role of known coherent gluon fields , with instantons as the most prominent example , in glueball structure .    the operator product expansion ( ope )  @xcite of glueball correlation functions provides an effective analytical framework for such investigations . in fact",
    ", it exhibits several exceptional features of the gluonium channels already at the qualitative level . the probably most instructive one",
    "is directly associated with the defining characteristic of the ope , i.e. its factorization of the short - distance correlators into contributions from hard and soft field modes . indeed , since the glueball",
    "s gluon content should be mostly nonperturbative , one might expect it to manifest itself primarily in the soft contributions , i.e. in the gluon condensates .",
    "surprisingly , this is not the case : the condensate contributions are unusually weak @xcite and can not fully reflect the nonperturbative nature of low - lying gluonia .",
    "this suggests that a major part of the nonperturbative physics is relatively hard and thus resides in the wilson coefficients .",
    "the present paper contains a detailed analysis of such contributions and a comprehensive study of their impact on spin-0 glueball properties .",
    "indications for the onset of nonperturbative physics in the scalar glueball correlator at unusually short distances , and the ensuing departure from asymptotic freedom , date back to the pioneering days of the qcd sum rule approach @xcite .",
    "the prototypical candidates for such hard , nonperturbative physics , direct instantons , describe tunneling processes which rearrange the qcd vacuum topology @xcite in localized space - time regions small enough to affect the @xmath1-dependence of the correlators over distances @xmath2 .",
    "although this physics enters the wilson coefficients , it was up to recently ignored in glueball ( and other ) sum rules , with the exception of an early explorative estimate in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the development of instanton `` liquid '' models @xcite allowed several bulk properties of the instanton size distribution in the vacuum to be estimated , and the emerging scales were later supported by lattice simulations @xcite . on the basis of these scales , the mentioned exploration of instanton contributions to a @xmath3 glueball sum rule @xcite found them to be of considerable size and indicated their potential for improving the consistency with the underlying low - energy theorem .",
    "however , the involved approximations and especially the neglect of the crucial instanton - induced continuum contributions did not allow for reliable estimates of glueball properties .",
    "only recently ,  the exact direct instanton contributions to the spin-0 glueball ope ( to leading order in @xmath4 ) were obtained and the instanton - induced continuum contributions derived @xcite . on the basis of the resulting `` instanton - improved ope '' ( iope ) the first quantitative qcd sum - rule analysis of direct instanton effects in scalar glueballs became possible .",
    "this analysis resolved long - standing consistency problems of the @xmath3 sum rules with purely perturbative wilson coefficients and led to new predictions for the scalar glueball mass and `` decay constant '' @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "in particular , the direct instanton contributions were found to increase the value of @xmath5 about threefold and supported earlier indications for an exceptionally small scalar glueball size @xcite .",
    "they also suggested a prominent role of instantons in the binding of the @xmath3 glueball and generated scaling relations between its main properties and bulk features of the instanton size distribution @xcite . a subsequent analysis of the related gaussian sum rules",
    "@xcite , based on the same instanton contributions , confirmed some of these results and studied more detailed parametrizations of the phenomenological correlator representation .",
    "previous implementations of direct instanton contributions to hadron correlators , including those in the @xmath3 glueball channel , relied on several standard approximations . however , there are reasons to suspect that these approximations may cause artefacts in the sum - rule results .",
    "we therefore provide a more thorough and systematic treatment of the direct - instanton sector below .",
    "our subsequent comprehensive sum - rule analysis will indeed reveal a significant impact of these improvements on the predicted glueball properties .",
    "in addition , we will extend the study of nonperturbative wilson coefficients to other glueball channels . while nonperturbative short - distance contributions are small in the tensor channel ( mainly due to the absence of leading instantons corrections ) , they turn out to generate a rather complex pattern of new physics in the pseudoscalar channel . the analysis of this physics and the ensuing predictions for @xmath0 glueball properties are further central objectives of our investigation and will provide additional insights into the role of ( semi- ) hard nonperturbative physics in glueball structure .",

    ".      two properties of the spin-0 glueball correlators indicate on general grounds that they will receive relatively large direct instanton contributions : ( i ) the underlying spin-0 interpolators ( [ sipf ] ) and ( [ pipf ] ) couple exceptionally strongly to instantons @xcite and ( ii ) the leading - order ( in @xmath4 ) instanton contributions are enhanced by inverse powers of the strong coupling ( cf .",
    "( [ gin ] ) ) .",
    "in addition , the instanton contributions show a strong dependence on spin and parity of the glueball correlator .",
    "this is reminiscent of the situation encountered in light meson and baryon correlators , where the remarkable topological , chiral , flavor and spin - color structure of the quark zero - modes @xcite in the instanton background generates a characteristic channel dependence pattern @xcite ( which is difficult to reproduce even in more sophisticated quark models @xcite ) .",
    "although the zero modes and quarks in general play a much smaller role in the glueball correlators , an equally ( if not more ) distinctive channel dependence exists among them , too .",
    "it is rooted in the ( anti- ) self - duality of the ( anti- ) instanton s field strength,@xmath46 ( in euclidean space - time ) and therefore of purely gluonic nature .",
    "( anti- ) self - dual gluon fields have color - electric and -magnetic fields of equal size , @xmath47 . as a consequence of the bianchi identity",
    ", they form a subset of all solutions of the euclidean yang - mills equation .    the impact of self - duality on the glueball correlators is twofold , as can be read off directly from the interpolating fields ( [ sipf ] ) - ( [ tipf ] ) .",
    "first , during continuation to minkowski space the euclidean self - duality equation ( [ sdual ] ) picks up a factor of @xmath48 , so that@xmath49 therefore , direct instanton ( or , more generally , self - dual ) contributions to the pseudoscalar glueball correlator are equal in size and opposite in sign to those of the scalar correlator .",
    "this property provides a strong link between the iopes of both channels , with far - reaching consequences for our analysis .",
    "moreover , self - duality implies that instanton - induced power corrections ( condensates ) to the iope of both @xmath3 and @xmath0 correlators are restricted to a few terms and cancel in their sum @xcite .",
    "double - counting of soft instanton physics in both wilson coefficients and condensates of the iope is therefore excluded ( with a few potential exceptions to be discussed below ) .",
    "furthermore , since direct - instanton induced interactions turn out to be attractive in the scalar glueball channel , they must be repulsive in the pseudoscalar channel .",
    "another obvious property of self - dual fields is that their energy , proportional to @xmath50 , is zero ( as expected for vacuum fields ) .",
    "hence their energy - momentum tensor vanishes , i.e. @xmath51 this implies the absence of leading direct instanton contributions to the tensor glueball correlator . as a consequence",
    ", we have nothing to add to the standard sum - rule analyses ( with solely perturbative wilson coefficients ) in the @xmath9 channel @xcite , except for a comment : the soft ( i.e. condensate ) contributions to the tensor correlator are conspicuously small , higher - dimensional power corrections vanish @xcite and instanton - induced power corrections are absent @xcite .",
    "nonperturbative contributions to the iope of this correlator should therefore primarily reside in the wilson coefficients of higher - dimensional operators ( starting with the gluon condensate ) .",
    "however , direct instanton ( and other hard , nonperturbative ) contributions , although not forbidden by self - duality , are suppressed by minimally four factors of @xmath52 where @xmath53 gev is the typical momentum scale in sum rule analyses .",
    "nonperturbative contributions to the iope coefficients are therefore expected to be small , too , perhaps related to the relatively weak binding in the tensor channel observed on the lattice @xcite .",

    "in order to make contact with the glueball information in the iope , we match it to the spectral representation of the correlators , i.e. we construct sum rules . the spectral representation in the hadronic basis is conveniently written in the form of a dispersion relation,@xmath54 where @xmath55 is the imaginary part of the correlator at time - like momenta and where the necessary number of subtractions is implied but not written explicitly . among the lowest - lying on - shell intermediate states which contribute to the spectral function @xmath56 are the lightest glueball in the @xmath57 channel ( probably with admixtures of light quarkonium ) and possibly light mesons with the same quantum numbers and sufficiently strong couplings to the gluonic interpolators . beyond the isolated resonances",

    "our results and general sum - rule experience suggest , however , that it should be similarly weak for @xmath407 . ] since mutual cancellations among all contributions are required to render the correlators @xmath85-independent , one expects the @xmath85-dependence of the nonperturbative coefficients to be similarly weak .",
    "this turns out to be indeed the case , mainly because large-@xmath190 contributions are already strongly suppressed by the external momentum scale @xmath408 gev in eq .",

    "we will therefore keep @xmath85 fixed in the quantitative analysis below .",

    "the shift of the peak is caused by the stronger reduction of the higher moments : due to the asymmetry of @xmath186 , impressed by its limiting behavior ( cf .",
    "( [ smallrhon ] ) and ( [ largerhon ] ) ) , @xmath419 increases with increasing @xmath355 .",
    "since this enhancement originates from the large-@xmath190 tail of the distribution , it is strongly reduced by renormalization and the ratio @xmath420 therefore decreases with @xmath355 .",
    "another significant renormalization effect is the reduction of the number of `` active '' instantons in the wilson coefficients , i.e. @xmath421 with @xmath422 , where @xmath423 correctly accounts for the density of _ direct _ instantons .",
    "this effect is missed when using the spike distribution since it is normalized to the total instanton density , i.e. large instantons with @xmath376 are not excluded but simply counted as instantons of average size .",
    "( this suggest to use @xmath423 instead of @xmath223 to improve direct instanton calculations on the basis of the spike distribution . )",
    "the above reasoning indicates , incidentally , that direct instanton calculations involving the spike distribution strictly make sense only for @xmath424 .",
    "although satisfied by the ( not very accurately determined ) standard values @xmath425 fm and @xmath426 fm , this condition would be violated by larger choices for @xmath85 and/or @xmath229 .    summarizing the main results of this section",
    ", we find the exclusion of non - direct instantons by an explicit large-@xmath190 cutoff to be mandatory when implementing finite - width distributions .",
    "however , the `` pragmatic '' neglect of @xmath85 _ together _ with the use of the spike distribution ( with @xmath424 ) can be useful for an approximate estimate of the borel moments since large instantons ( with @xmath227 ) are rare in the qcd vacuum and since their contributions are bounded by @xmath427 acting as an additional cutoff .",
    "this justifies the tacit assumption underlying earlier implementations of direct instantons .",
    "nevertheless , the renormalization generates several new and important effects , including an effective reduction of the instanton density , which will significantly improve both sum rule consistency and results ( see sec .",

    "therefore it is hardly surprising that the signal for the pseudoscalar glueball disappears and that even the general positivity requirement is violated @xcite when these repulsive contributions are added to the perturbative wilson coefficients .",
    "we demonstrate this by plotting the @xmath318 borel moment in the @xmath0 channel , @xmath428   e^{-s\\tau } , \\label{r0inpert}%\\ ] ] obtained from both perturbative and instanton - induced wilson coefficients ( on the basis of the spike distribution ( [ spike ] ) ) , in fig .",

    "in fact , this might not be as paradoxical as it first appears : although the moments ( [ rkinst ] ) have the same magnitude in both channels , the direct instanton contributions to the sum rules do not .",
    "the difference lies in the value of the duality threshold @xmath63 which is typically more than twice as large in the @xmath0 than in the @xmath3 channel .",
    "( this is mainly a reflection of the larger @xmath0 glueball mass . )",
    "their rather strong @xmath63-dependence thus equips the direct instanton contributions with a certain channel dependence .    as demonstrated above , however , this channel dependence is too weak to resolve the mentioned deficiencies .",

    "since our treatment of the direct instanton sector leaves not much room for further improvement , , multi - instanton effects are generally negligible , due to the small instanton packing fraction . in the pseudoscalar meson channel , where direct instanton contributions have exceptional strength @xcite , this was shown explicitly @xcite .",
    "] one is bound to conclude that essential additional physics is still missing in the iope coefficients of the @xmath0 glueball correlator .",
    "our main guide in the search for this physics , which will be subject of the next section , is the fact that it apparently did not show up in other hadron channels : previously considered sum rules were found to be consistent and stable with perturbative and direct - instanton induced wilson coefficients only .",
    "as argued above , the failure of direct instanton contributions to generate acceptable pseudoscalar glueball sum rules strongly suggests that equally important - and therefore very likely nonperturbative - contributions to the wilson coefficients are still amiss . since these contributions should affect almost exclusively the @xmath0 glueball correlator , one",

    ". the impact of the remaining imbalance can be rather subtle since it is largest towards the upper boundary of the fiducial @xmath74-domain where the match to the exponential resonance contributions becomes delicate .",
    "a glance at the above scales confirms that such a match is ruled out in the @xmath0 channel , with its extreme discrepancy between let and direct - instanton induced subtraction constants , if the nonperturbative iope coefficients arise exclusively from direct instantons . as we have shown in sec .",
    "[ somix ] , however , this inconsistency is overcome by the crucial topological charge screening correction@xmath563 which cancels most of the direct - instanton contribution ( [ subcdiri ] ) and brings the total iope subtraction constant in line with the small let value ( [ pletquanti ] ) .",
    "previous analyses of @xmath0 sum rules have discarded the @xmath37 moment and therefore missed valuable first - principle information from the low - energy theorem as well as a useful consistency check .",

    "indeed , it becomes @xmath564 where we have used the standard ( quenched ) lattice value @xmath565 gev@xmath566 for the topological susceptibility @xcite , which is in agreement with the witten - veneziano formula @xcite .",
    "thus we find again perfect consistency : the let subtraction constant  becomes much larger and cancels the direct - instanton contributions by itself ( assuming that the latter are not strongly affected by quenching ) .",
    "a special situation arises if the difference between the iope and let values of the subtraction constant becomes so strongly negative that even the @xmath539-dependent contributions can not prevent @xmath567 from turning negative inside the fiducial @xmath74-domain .",

    "the main effect of the instanton contribution is to turn the sign negative , which causes the mentioned decline in sum - rule consistency .",
    "one option to deal with this problem is to assume that unreliably calculated soft contributions dominate the instanton - induced subtraction constant ( in particular when using the spike distribution ) , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ iborelmom ] , and therefore to discard it completely .",

    "this shows that the main reason for achieving a large glueball mass scale and let consistency in the @xmath130 sum rule is the large overall size and slope of the @xmath74-dependent direct instanton contributions ( and not the relatively small , instanton - induced subtraction constant , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    of course , discarding the instanton - induced subtraction constant completely is a very crude way of  renormalization  .",
    "our implementation of the iope renormalization scale on the basis of realistic size distributions accounts more accurately for the soft physics to be removed .",
    "comparison of the above scales shows that this significantly improves the consistency with the let : the difference between instanton- and let - induced subtraction terms is reduced by @xmath422 , and for realistic values @xmath569 ( cf .",

[ somix ] ) .    in the context of this section",
    "it might be useful to recall that the large `` phenomenological '' subtraction constant had caused serious problems in the @xmath3glueball sum rule as long as the nonperturbative wilson coefficients were ignored : the ensuing , weaker decay of the sum ( [ rsum ] ) generated a much smaller @xmath3glueball mass `` prediction '' ( well below 1 gev ) which was inconsistent with the predictions well beyond 1 gev from the @xmath82 sum rules .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the missing , strongly decaying @xmath74-dependence can only reside in the wilson coefficients and that it should be of nonperturbative origin , suggesting ( together with other indications ) direct instantons as its main source .",
    "the inclusion of the direct instanton contributions indeed overcame the mutual inconsistencies among the @xmath3 sum rule predictions and restored the consistency with the let .    in summary , the direct - instanton induced subtraction terms and their renormalization play a rather complex role in the @xmath37 glueball sum rules . in both channels they are essential for achieving consistency with the underlying low - energy theorems . in the pseudoscalar sum rules ,",
    "this additionally requires strong cancellations with the indispensable topological charge screening contributions .",
    "these cancellations explain , in particular , how the equal size of the instanton - induced subtraction constants in both spin-0 glueball channels can be reconciled with the conspicuous difference between the let values .      in order to extract glueball properties from the iope borel moments by means of a qcd sum - rule analysis , the parametrization of the phenomenological spectral functions and the matching criteria have to be specified",
    "of course , the complexity of the phenomenological side ( measured by the number of parameters to be predicted ) is limited by the information content and resolution power of the truncated short - distance expansion .",
    "therefore , judicious decisions are required about the amount of detail to include , e.g. about the number of isolated resonances , their individual widths and shapes , specific assumptions on quarkonium admixtures or even explicit multi - hadron continua ( beyond the local - duality approximation ) . guided by the asymptotic nature of the spacelike iope",

    "the duality continuum in the borel moments ( [ phenspec ] ) increasingly dominates the glueball signal . in order to ensure that the sum rules remain sensitive to the glueball properties , we therefore fix @xmath578 by the standard requirement that the continuum contributions to the borel moments must not exceed the resonance contributions , i.e. @xmath579 generally , the higher borel moments require larger values of @xmath580 .",
    "the above criterion therefore also helps to assure consistency among sum rule predictions from different moments .",

    "the sum rule consistency noticeably worsens , however , when finite - width distributions are used without subtracting the large-@xmath190 contributions .",
    "the @xmath130 sum rule , singled out by the presence of subtraction terms ( cf .",

    "as explained before , the direct instanton contributions with their large slope ( cf .",
    "7 ) resolve this problem @xcite .",

    "even larger discrepancies , encountered e.g. when using smaller values of the gluon condensate , could be accommodated .",
    "the  @xmath618 sum rule would then predict a larger value of @xmath63 and a marginally larger glueball mass .",
    "in addition to the sum - rule fits for the total iope borel moments , fig . 7 also shows the contributions from perturbative and nonperturbative wilson coefficients separately .",
    "comparison with the analogous figures in ref .",
    "@xcite ( based on the spike distribution ) confirms the discussion of sec .",
    "[ qualbehav ] :  the perturbative contributions are somewhat enhanced by the @xmath97 corrections while the direct instanton contributions are significantly reduced in the improved iope . (",
    "the duality continuum threshold decreases somewhat , too . ) as a result , perturbative and nonperturbative coefficients are now of comparable size .",
    "moreover , the slopes of the instanton contributions are reduced .",
    "both effects manifests themselves in a 20% smaller prediction for the scalar glueball mass .",
    "however , the about threefold increase of the glueball decay constant @xmath5 predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite ( relative to previous sum rule analyses ) remains intact .",
    "this implies that the reduced size of the borel moments on the left - hand side of the sum rules ( [ gbsrs ] ) is compensated by the increased perturbative contributions and , in particular , by the smaller glueball - mass factors on the right - hand side .",
    "our large result for @xmath5 predicts strongly increased partial widths for the radiative decay of the heavy quarkonia @xmath619 and @xmath620 ( and others ) into scalar glueballs and therefore has relevance for experimental glueball searches @xcite .",
    "in particular , it allows for an improved analysis of the existing @xmath621 decay data of the cleo collaboration @xcite and the forthcoming larger samples from cleo - iii .",
    "it will also be interesting to compare our prediction to the first calculation of @xmath5 on the ( quenched ) lattice which is in progress @xcite .",
    "since @xmath5 is related to the glueball wave function ( or bethe - salpeter amplitude ) at the origin , our large value predicts a strongly concentrated wave function and thus an unusually small size of the scalar glueball .",

    "however , one would expect light - quark effects and quarkonium admixtures to lower the quenched masses at least somewhat .",
    "due to its smaller size , furthermore , the scalar glueball should be particularly susceptible to the momentum dependence of the sea - quark induced vacuum polarization which modifies the color - dielectric properties of the vacuum at short distances @xcite .",
    "since this part of the vacuum polarization is neglected in the quenched approximation , one would expect the quenched mass predictions to be less reliable in the scalar channel .",
    "this expectation is supported , e.g. , by the recent analysis of the radial - excitation and regge trajectories of the known isoscalar mesons @xcite , including those newly established by the crystal barrel collaboration in proton - antiproton annihilation .",
    "the standard @xmath3 glueball candidates above 1 gev , i.e. the @xmath623 , @xmath624 and @xmath625 resonances , are found to lie solidly on @xmath626 trajectories and to fit well into a flavor nonet classification .",
    "instead , the @xmath627-matrix analysis predicts a light and broad scalar glueball state in the 1200 - 1600 mev region @xcite , compatible with our result .",
    "an even lighter ( and similarly broad ) glueball state , centered around 1 gev or a bit larger , is expected in mixing schemes which assume only one @xmath3 multiplet below 1.8 gev @xcite .",
    "the @xmath355-dependence of our predictions for the scalar glueball properties in tab .",
    "[ ts ] shows a certain systematics . while the results for the coupling are practically @xmath355-independent ( within sum - rule accuracy ) , the predictions for the mass increase  with @xmath355 for @xmath82 .",
    "since @xmath5 is associated with the integrated strength of the glueball , it enters all sum rules ( [ gbsrs ] ) in the same ( i.e. @xmath355-independent ) power .",
    "the @xmath355-dependence of @xmath5 in tab .",
    "[ ts ] thus gives an idea of the typical uncertainties of the matching analysis .",
    "the variations in the mass predictions , on the other hand , are larger and systematically increase with @xmath355 .",
    "this suggest that the glueball strength is distributed over a rather broad @xmath343-region : since the higher moments weight the spectral function more strongly at larger @xmath343 , they will then predict a larger pole mass ( cf .",
    "( [ gbsrs ] ) ) .",
    "( the @xmath37 sum rule result is not conclusive in this regard since it receives additional contributions from the subtraction terms . )",
    "our predicted mass range can therefore be regarded as a rough lower bound on the width of the scalar glueball , i.e. @xmath628 gev , similar to the width found in the @xmath627-matrix analysis @xcite .",
    "the gap @xmath586 between glueball mass and continuum threshold , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ delm ] ) , is relatively constant among the @xmath82 sum - rule results , @xmath629 while it is about twice as large in the @xmath37 sum rule ( @xmath630 gev ) , due to the subtraction term .",
    "the assumption of a common shift @xmath586 for all sum rules in a simplified analysis ( cf .",
    "( [ srsetup ] ) ) would therefore fail in the lowest moment .",
    "the relatively early onset of the continuum may indicate , incidentally , that the first excited scalar glueball state lies around 2 gev .",
    "although the quenched lattice spectrum predicts this excitation",
    "well beyond 2 gev and beyond the lowest @xmath0 glueball state , its mass might again be lowered by quarkonium admixtures .",
    "we had argued above that the quality of the one - pole sum rule fits leaves little room for physically significant improvement and provides no clear evidence for an additional low - lying resonance with strong coupling to the gluonic interpolating field .",
    "nevertheless , a residual @xmath74-dependence of the borel moment ratio @xmath549 was found in sec .",
    "[ qualbehav ] , and the fit quality of the @xmath540 sum rule is somewhat lower than that of the other ones ( cf . tab .",
    "[ ts ] and fig . 7 ) . since this sum rule is probably most sensitive to low - lying strength , in particular at large @xmath74 where it would be hidden in @xmath130 by the subtraction constants , it is tempting to attribute its reduced fit quality to some broad , low - lying structure missing on the phenomenological side .",
    "amusingly , this would be consistent with the @xmath627-matrix analysis of the @xmath3 meson data @xcite which tentatively identifies the broad `` @xmath631 resonance '' @xmath632 as a probably gluon - rich exotic state .",
    "unfortunately , a two - resonance analysis of the @xmath540 sum rule does not help to settle this issue : due to the high quality of the one - pole fits , it can hardly reduce the deviation measure further and thus becomes unstable .",
    "( if nevertheless performed , it seems to favor an only somewhat smaller mass @xmath633 gev of the lowest - lying resonance and a heavier glueball at @xmath634 gev . )",
    "we conclude that significant low - lying @xmath3 strength with a sufficiently strong coupling to the gluonic interpolator ( [ sipf ] ) , if it exists , is probably to broadly distributed to be resolved by a sum rules analysis .      as in the scalar channel ,",
    "we start by surveying the quantitative behavior of all four sum rules in order to determine how many isolated resonances are required . the result is opposite to that in the scalar channel :  all sum rules , especially those derived from the lower borel moments , clearly favor two resonances , with a large separation between their masses .",
    "the improvement over the one - pole fits is substantial .",
    "in fact , the latter do not only produce significantly larger errors but also tend to destabilize the sum rules since either the stronger decay at small @xmath74 or the weaker one at large @xmath74 , but not both , can be matched to one resonance .    the emergence of a second , relatively low - lying isolated resonance is of course expected .",
    "in fact , its traces were already visible in the qualitative decay behavior of the borel moments ( cf .",
    "[ qualbehav ] ) . moreover , our discussion in sec .",
    "[ topscr ] anticipated the emergence of large @xmath441 intermediate - state contributions to the @xmath0 glueball correlator , as a consequence of the anomaly - induced @xmath441-coupling to the topological charge .",
    "the results of the quantitative sum rule analysis , listed in table [ tp ] , indeed confirm this expectation : the central mass value of the lighter resonance reproduces the @xmath441 mass .",
    "our central value for the coupling @xmath635 is somewhat larger than its phenomenological value @xmath636 gev @xcite , likely because of @xmath637-admixtures .",
    "( note that we treat @xmath635 on the same footing as the glueball decay constant , i.e. we do not extract the conventional factor @xmath638 . ) in any case , the result for @xmath635 is probably our least accurate sum rule prediction since it originates from the  small residue of the large-@xmath74 tail .",
    "a two - resonance analysis , with five independent hadronic parameters to be determined , generally stretches the sum - rule resolution to its limits .",
    "in fact , there is no guarantee that such an analysis will be stable . the large separation between the resonance masses in the @xmath0 channel",
    ", however , improves the situation decisively since it assigns mutually almost exclusive roles to the two poles : the heavier @xmath0 glueball has to fit the small-@xmath74 region and consequently decays so fast that it can not significantly `` contaminate '' the large-@xmath74 tail , which is mostly generated by the @xmath441 .",
    "this scenario is corroborated by the fact that the predicted @xmath441 properties are , in contrast to the glueball properties , almost @xmath63-independent .",
    "a glance at fig .",
    "4 shows that the small-@xmath74 behavior of the moments indeed varies much more strongly with @xmath63 than the tails .",
    "it turns out that the clear mass separation renders the five - parameter fits stable and makes a quantitative sum rule analysis possible .    as another consequence of the large gap between the resonance masses , the relative strength of the @xmath441 and glueball signals , @xmath639 , decreases strongly with @xmath355 since the borel moments weight the large-@xmath343 region of the spectral function by a factor @xmath390 . for this reason ,",
    "the glueball predictions of the higher - moment sum rules become more stable and the quality of one - pole fits improves with @xmath355 , reflecting the diminishing impact of the @xmath441 .",
    "nevertheless , the one - pole analysis remains inherently unstable since the resonance exponential can either match the iope moments at large or small @xmath74 , but not over the whole fiducial region .",
    "hence the two - pole fits continue to be superior even for @xmath640 .",
    "the impact of the condensate contributions , incidentally , also decreases with @xmath355 since the higher @xmath355-moments are obtained by derivatives with respect to @xmath309 and thus decrease the size of the power corrections at large @xmath74 .",

    "the central themes of this paper are the derivation of nonperturbative short - distance contributions to the spin-0 glueball correlators and a comprehensive sum - rule analysis of their predictions for glueball properties .",
    "the dominant nonperturbative contributions to the operator product expansion of these correlators turn out to be ( semi- ) hard , i.e. to reside in the wilson coefficients .",
    "their soft counterparts , contained in the condensates , play a comparatively minor role .",
    "both sources of hard nonperturbative physics considered in this paper , direct instantons and topological charge screening , are associated with the topology of the vacuum gluon fields or , equivalently , of the qcd gauge group .",

    "the complementary bulk information on the soft physics , which enters through a few condensates and the instanton size distribution , can be straightforwardly imported from other sources .",
    "direct instanton contributions to other hadron correlators were calculated previously , and several important effects with diverse physical impact were found in the corresponding qcd sum rules ( including those for the @xmath3 glueball ) .",
    "however , their evaluation was restrained by three major approximations : ( i ) all instantons were taken to be of the same size , ( ii ) the renormalization of the instanton - induced wilson coefficients was ignored and ( iii ) the contributions of only the instanton nearest to the interpolator arguments were taken into account explicitly .",
    "the first of these approximations becomes exact in instanton vacuum models at large @xmath42 and the third can be regarded as the leading term in an expansion in the instanton density . the second , although convenient , is not strictly associated with a systematic expansion .",
    "an important point on our agenda was to assess the validity of these approximations and to improve upon them .",

    "these developments are channel independent and will be useful in other hadron correlators as well .",
    "the improvements in the direct - instanton sector have several notable effects on the glueball sum rule analysis and its results .",
    "finite - width distributions considerably slow the asymptotic decay of the instanton contributions at large momentum transfer , which reduces the glueball mass predictions .",
    "they furthermore resolve artefacts in the iope which previously distorted the borel moments and contaminated the results for the scalar glueball . as an additional benefit ,",
    "realistic instanton size distributions tend to enlarge the fiducial @xmath74-domain of the sum rule analysis .",
    "the gauge - invariant renormalization of the instanton - induced wilson coefficients significantly improves the consistency with the underlying low - energy theorem in the scalar channel , and sum - rule consistency in general .",
    "renormalization also reduces the overall size of the instanton contributions .",
    "the reanalysis of our previous iope sum rules in the scalar glueball channel shows that the beneficial impact of the direct instanton contributions is enhanced by the above improvements .",
    "the consistency among different borel moments and with the low - energy theorem is consolidated and the previously deficient and usually discarded lowest - moment sum rule becomes one of the most stable and reliable .    in the pseudoscalar channel",
    "the emerging pattern is more complex : the sum rules with purely perturbative wilson are found to be consistent with the corresponding low - energy theorem ( which had not been appreciated before since the pertinent @xmath501 sum rule was not analyzed ) .",
    "however , this consistency is lost entirely when direct instanton corrections are included and additional physics , both ( semi- ) hard and nonperturbative , is needed to restore it .",
    "our third improvement of the iope consists in identifying this missing physics as due to topological charge screening and in implementing the screening contributions .",
    "this is our conceptually farthest - reaching extension of the ope since it introduces for the first time nonperturbative physics beyond single instantons into the iope coefficients .",
    "this physics turns out to be highly channel - selective : it almost exclusively affects the @xmath0 glueball correlator ( and the related @xmath441 correlator ) which is proportional to the topological charge correlator and thus specifically tuned to those light - quark induced correlations which produce topological charge screening . under the suggestive assumption that the topological vacuum charge is mostly due to instantons , the implementation of its screening can be regarded as an improvement upon approximation ( iii ) mentioned above : the small instanton packing fraction does not suppress the exceptionally strong and short - ranged correlations between opposite topological charges as strongly as others .",
    "therefore , in this specific case the nearest - instanton approximation is insufficient and the screening corrections have to be added in the @xmath0 glueball ( and @xmath441 ) channel .",
    "we have found compelling evidence for the screening contributions to be an indispensable complement to the direct instanton contributions .",
    "they restore consistency with the axial ward identity and thereby overcome , in particular , the above - mentioned problem with the low - energy theorem .",
    "this manifests itself e.g. in the screening contributions to the subtraction constant in the lowest - moment sum rule which cancel most of the direct instanton contributions . in the chiral limit , this cancellation becomes exact .",
    "it also explains in a natural way how the equal size of the instanton - induced subtraction constants in both spin-0 glueball channels can be reconciled with the order - of - magnitude difference in the sizes of their phenomenological counterparts .",
    "( in the absence of light quarks this difference would practically disappear together with the screening contributions , so that the sum rules would remain intact . )",
    "the topological charge screening corrections lead to the emergence of a strong @xmath441 resonance signal and necessitate a two - resonance analysis of the @xmath0 sum rules .",
    "remarkably , the large gap between the @xmath441 and @xmath0 glueball masses allows for a simultaneous prediction of all associated resonance and threshold parameters .",
    "the impact of the direct instanton contributions differs strongly in both spin-0 glueball channels .",
    "in addition to their opposite sign ( a consequence of the instanton s self - dual field strength ) , the larger continuum threshold and the strong cancellations with the screening corrections drastically modify the role of the instantons in the @xmath0 channel and counterbalance their repulsion .",
    "in fact , ignoring the screening contributions would , besides violating the anomalous ward identity , lead to spectral positivity violations and the disappearance of the @xmath0 glueball signal .",
    "pseudoscalar glueball sum rules with unscreened direct instanton contributions are therefore invalid .",
    "our comprehensive numerical analysis of all eight borel sum rules in both spin-0 glueball channels reveals a rather diverse pattern of glueball properties .",
    "the hard topological physics in the iope coefficients turns out to strongly affect the sum rule results and to generate several new predictions . in the scalar channel , the improved treatment of the direct - instanton sector",
    "reduces our earlier ( spike - distribution based ) result for the @xmath3 glueball mass by about 20% , to @xmath683 gev .",
    "although still consistent within errors , our new central mass prediction is smaller than the quenched lattice result .",
    "however , light - quark effects and especially quarkonium admixtures are expected to reduce the quenched masses , and the first unquenched simulations indeed show a tendency towards smaller scalar glueball masses .",
    "moreover , our mass prediction is consistent with the broad glueball state found in a recent @xmath627-matrix analysis of the scalar meson spectrum which includes the new states recently identified in the crystal barrel data .",
    "the systematics in our results from different borel - moment sum rules indicates a rather large width of the scalar glueball , @xmath684 gev .",
    "a similarly large width is found in @xmath627-matrix and mixing analyses and could also be expected from unquenched lattice simulations with realistic quark masses , due to the increased number of open decay channels .    our prediction for the glueball decay constant ,  @xmath685 gev , is several times larger than the value obtained when ignoring the nonperturbative wilson coefficients .",
    "this result implies an exceptionally small glueball size , in agreement with some lattice and instanton liquid model evidence .",
    "the strong concentration of the @xmath3 glueball ( bethe - salpeter ) wave function is therefore at least partially explained by the strong instanton - induced attraction between gluons in the scalar channel .",
    "moreover , its small size makes the scalar glueball more susceptible to the momentum - dependence of the color - dielectric constant arising from sea quarks . since",
    "this part of the vacuum polarization is missing in the quenched approximation , one would expect larger errors in the quenched predictions for the @xmath3 glueball properties than for their @xmath0 counterparts .",
    "this might explain why our mass prediction deviates more strongly from the quenched results in the scalar channel .",
    "furthermore , our enhanced prediction for @xmath5 implies substantially larger partial widths of radiative @xmath619 and @xmath620 decays into scalar glueballs .",
    "it is therefore of importance for experimental glueball searches , in particular for the interpretation of the recent cleo and forthcoming cleo - iii data on @xmath621 and other decay branches , and for related measurements of scalar glueball properties .",
    "although hints of some gluon - rich spectral strength in the @xmath3 channel well below 1 gev can be detected in the sum rule analysis , we find no clear evidence for a low - lying and sufficiently narrow glueball resonance in the region of the @xmath632 .",
    "( the @xmath130 sum rule would `` predict '' a spurious low - lying resonance if the direct instanton contributions were ignored .",
    "however , this result is inconsistent with both the low - energy theorem and the higher - moment sum rules and therefore obsolete . )    in the pseudoscalar glueball channel , the topological charge screening contributions do not only resurrect the sum rules but also have a strong impact on their quantitative predictions .",
    "due to the cancellations with the direct instanton contributions , the overall size of the nonperturbative iope coefficients remains below about 20% of their perturbative counterparts and the detrimental problems encountered when ignoring the screening contributions are resolved .",
    "although the origin of the individual nonperturbative contributions is more diverse and complex than in the scalar channel , their overall impact is therefore smaller .",
    "this is one of the reasons for the considerably weaker binding of the @xmath0 glueball .",
    "nevertheless , the hard nonperturbative contributions modify qualitative features of the @xmath0 borel moments to which the matching analysis is particularly sensitive , and they are vital  for achieving consistency among all moment sum rules and with the axial anomaly .",
    "the strong cancellations among the nonperturbative contributions to the pseudoscalar iope may also explain why qcd sum rule estimates of the derivative of the topological susceptibility , which plays an important role in the analysis of the proton spin content , seem to be sufficiently consistent without nonperturbative wilson coefficients .",
    "their reanalysis on the basis of the full iope is in progress .",
    "the quantitative sum rule analysis results in the values @xmath686 gev for the pseudoscalar glueball mass and @xmath687 gev for the decay constant .",
    "our mass prediction lies inside the range obtained from quenched and unquenched lattice data .",
    "the coupling is again enhanced by the nonperturbative wilson coefficients , but less strongly than in the scalar channel .",
    "the consequently larger partial width of radiative quarkonium decays into pseudoscalar glueballs and the enhanced @xmath678 cross section at high momentum transfers will be relevant for the experimental identification of the lowest - lying @xmath0 glueball and help in measuring its properties",
    ".    our extended iope should be useful for the calculation of other spin-0 glueball properties as well .",
    "quantitative estimates of the already mentioned production rates in gluon - rich channels ( including @xmath619 and @xmath620 decays ) and characteristic glueball decay properties and signatures , including @xmath688 couplings , ozi suppression and branching fractions incompatible with @xmath626 decay , would be particularly interesting .",
