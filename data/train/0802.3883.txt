    "recently developed observational techniques provide good quality data from observations of quasiperiodic oscillations ( qpos ) in black hole and neutron star sources @xcite .",
    "it is shown that in the case of some neutron star atoll sources ( e.g. 4u1636 - 53 @xcite ) the data can be well fitted by the so called multiresonant total precession model @xcite .",
    "the fits give high precision values of the neutron star spacetime parameters ; in addition , in some cases the rotation frequency of the neutron star is measured determined almost exactly from the qpo independent measurements .",
    "this enables us to put some limits on equations of state ( eos ) describing the neutron star interior .",
    "here we focus our attention of the eos given by the skyrmion interaction that are very well tuned to the data given by the nuclear physics @xcite . using the genetic algorithm method , which appears to be very fast and efficient , we select the acceptable eos from 27 types of the skyrmion eos selected by other methods @xcite , concentrating on the source 4u 1636 - 53 . for the other five atoll sources ,",
    "the method gives similar results .",
    "the results of recent studies of neutron star qpos indicate that for a given source the upper and lower qpo frequency can be traced through the whole range of observed frequencies but the probability to detect both qpos simultaneously increases when the frequency ratio is close to ratio of small natural numbers ( namely 3/2 , 4/3 , 5/4 in the case of atoll sources studies recently , see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the multi  resonant orbital model based on the oscillation with keplerian ( @xmath3 ) and epicyclic vertical ( @xmath4 ) or radial ( @xmath5 ) frequencies was used to explain the observed data @xcite .",
    "they are calculated assuming the spacetime given by the hartle ",
    "thorne metric @xcite .",
    "the fitting procedure have shown that the best results are obtained using the total precession model , where in all the sources the upper frequency @xmath6 and the lower frequency @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "we concentrate here on the case of 4u 1636 - 53 , when the mass and dimensionless spin of the neutron star are fitted to values ( @xmath8 precision ) in the range @xmath9 this interval of allowed values of @xmath1 and @xmath10 will be used to test the eos for the neutron star in the 4u 1636 - 53 source .",
    "in neutron star , the strong gravity ( i.e. einsteins gravitational equations ) must be relevant being crucial for the structure equations . the spacetime geometry is assumed to be stationary and axisymmetric , the perturbative approach of hartle and thorne @xcite is used .",

    "the integration is done outward from the center ( for given values of central energy density @xmath15 ) up to surface ( where pressure vanishes ) .",
    "one obtains the global properties of non  rotating neutron star as its mass @xmath1 , radius @xmath16 and the internal characteristic profiles as metric coefficients , pressure , energy density and number density of baryons expressed as functions of the radial coordinate distance from center .",

    "we have selected ga with sexual reproduction containing one chromosome with restricted lifetime parameter , 5 iterations .",
    "the crossover operator is selected with uniform crossing , using genes of type 3/3/5 .",
    "we used the gray code for encrypt parameters to chromosomes , which is useful by reason of bypassing so - called hamming barrier .",
    "chromosomes are compound of genes ; each gene presents 1 bit value .",
    "however , genes contain more than 1 bit ( using the redundancy encrypt ) .",
    "bit values inside a gene are mapped onto outside value of gene ( 0 or 1 ) via specific map function , in which border between 0 and 1 is not crisp , but there exists so - called `` shade zone '' , where value carried by the gene is determined randomly .",

    "the second one determines the eos , @xmath66 , @xmath0 with using fitness function @xmath67 .",
    "both tasks put limits on the eos under consideration .",
    "overcoming those limits implies removing the corresponding chromosomes by setting value of fitness function to a maximum value ( @xmath68 ) . for a given eos allowed neutron star structure",
    "is provided the ga described above and fitness function @xmath67 .",
    "the chromosome structure is given by two values , central density and rotation frequency .",
    "interval of central density we choose from @xmath69 to @xmath70 .    in the first task , partition of central density is set to 4096 ( 12 bits ) .",
    "interval of rotation frequency is set from 50 to 8000 and partition to 8192 ( 13 bits ) . following table shows determination of central density ( in units of @xmath71 ) and rotation frequency for given number of eos .",

    "analysis of qpo s in neutron star atoll sources in the framework of hartle  thorne geometry gives a very detailed data ( neutron star parameters as mass , spin and quadrupole momentum ) that could be quite well used for constraining the wide scale of allowed eos constraining the structure of neutron stars by solving the complex set of structure differential equations .",
    "the testing by standard approaches is a long time consuming procedure . here",
    ", we show in the case of atoll source 4u 163653 that the genetic algorithm method could make the proper selection in a wide sample of eos of skyrmion type in a very efficient and short way ( with same precision and the time consumed for the ga about 30 minutes , being by orders shorter that the time consumed by the standard methods ) .",
    "we can conclude that using the ga with chromosome ( eos,@xmath73 , @xmath0 ) and putting physically motivated restrictions on the angular velocity ( @xmath0 ) and central density ( @xmath73 ) governing the neutron star model being an output of the structure equations and the fitness function @xmath67 in the algorithm procedure , we are able to find the most probably structure of neutron star that fits the observed qpo data , with respect to observed rotational frequency for the source 4u 163653 .",
    "it is given by the chromosome ( @xmath74 ) .",
