    "the theory of graphons has provided a powerful tool for sampling and studying convergence properties for sequences of dense graphs .",
    "graphons characterize limiting properties of dense graph sequences , such as properties arising in combinatorial optimization and statistical physics .",
    "furthermore , sequences of dense graphs sampled from a ( possibly random ) graphon are characterized by a natural notion of exchangeability via the aldous - hoover theorem .",
    "this paper presents an analogous theory for sparse graphs .    in the past few years",
    ", graphons have been used as non - parametric extensions of stochastic block models , to model and learn large networks .",
    "there have been several rigorous papers on the subject of consistent estimation using graphons ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) , and graphons have also been used to estimate real - world networks , such as facebook and linkedin @xcite .",
    "this makes it especially useful to have graphon models for sparse networks with unbounded degrees , which are the appropriate description of many large real - world networks .    in the classical theory of graphons",
    "as studied in , for example , @xcite , a graphon is a symmetric @xmath10$]-valued function defined on a probability space . in our generalized theory we let the underlying measure space of the graphon be a @xmath1-finite measure space ; i.e. , we allow the space to have infinite total measure . more precisely , given a @xmath1-finite measure space @xmath11 we define a graphon to be a pair @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a symmetric integrable function , with the special case when @xmath14 is @xmath10$]-valued being most relevant for the random graphs studied in the current paper .",
    "we present a random graph model associated with these generalized graphons which has a number of properties making it appropriate for modelling sparse networks , and we present a new theory for convergence of graphs in which our generalized graphons arise naturally as limits of sparse graphs .    given a @xmath10$]-valued graphon @xmath12 with @xmath11 a @xmath1-finite measure space , we will now define a random process which generalizes the classical notion of @xmath15-random graphs , introduced in the statistics literature @xcite under the name latent position graphs , in the context of graph limits @xcite as @xmath15-random graphs , and in the context of extensions of the classical random graph theory @xcite as inhomogeneous random graphs . recall that in the classical setting where @xmath15 is defined on a probability space , @xmath15-random graphs are generated by first choosing @xmath16 points @xmath17 i.i.d .  from the probability distribution @xmath18 over the feature space @xmath6 , and then connecting the vertices @xmath19 and @xmath20 with probability @xmath21 .",
    "here , inspired by caron and fox @xcite , we generalize this to arbitrary @xmath1-finite measure spaces by first considering a poisson point process @xmath22 with intensity @xmath7 on @xmath6 for any fixed @xmath23 , and then connecting two points @xmath24 in @xmath22 with probability @xmath21 .",
    "as explained in the next paragraph , this leads to a family of graphs @xmath25 such that the graphs @xmath26 have almost surely at most countably infinitely many vertices and ( assuming appropriate integrability conditions on @xmath14 , e.g. , @xmath27 ) a finite number of edges . removing all isolated vertices from @xmath26",
    ", we obtain a family of graphs @xmath28 that are almost surely finite .",
    "we refer to the families @xmath29 and @xmath30 as _ graphon processes _ ; when it is necessary to distinguish the two , we call them graphon processes with or without isolated vertices , respectively .     from a graphon @xmath12 , where @xmath11 is a @xmath1-finite measure space .",
    "the two coordinate axes on the middle figure represent our feature space @xmath6 , where the red ( resp .",
    "blue ) dots on the axes represent vertices born during @xmath31 $ ] ( resp .  @xmath32 $ ] ) for @xmath33 , and the red ( resp .",
    "blue ) dots in the interior of the first quadrant represent edges in @xmath34 for @xmath35 ( resp .",
    "@xmath36 ) . the graph @xmath5 is an induced subgraph of a graph @xmath26 with infinitely many vertices in the case @xmath37 , such that @xmath5 is obtained from @xmath26 by removing isolated vertices . at time",
    "@xmath38 the marginal law of the features of @xmath39 is the points of a poisson point process on @xmath6 with intensity @xmath7 .",
    "two distinct vertices with features @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , are connected to each other by an undirected edge with probability @xmath42 .",
    "the coordinate axes on the right figure represent time @xmath43 .",
    "we get the graph @xmath5 by considering the edges restricted to @xmath44 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "note that the coordinate axes in the right figure and the graphs @xmath26 in the left figure are slightly inaccurate if we assume @xmath37 , since in this case there are infinitely many isolated vertices in @xmath26 for each @xmath23 .",
    "we have chosen to label the vertices by the order in which they appear in @xmath5 , where ties are resolved by considering the time the vertices were born , i.e. , by considering the time they appeared in @xmath26 . ]    to interpret the graphon process @xmath30 as a family of growing graphs we will need to couple the graphs @xmath5 for different times @xmath38 . to this end , we consider a poisson point process @xmath45 on @xmath46 ( @xmath47 being equipped with the borel @xmath1-algebra and lebesgue measure ) .",
    "each point @xmath48 of @xmath45 corresponds to a vertex of an infinite graph @xmath49 , where the coordinate @xmath50 is interpreted as the time the vertex is born and the coordinate @xmath40 describes a feature of the vertex .",
    "two distinct vertices @xmath48 and @xmath51 are connected by an undirected edge with probability @xmath42 , independently for each possible pair of distinct vertices .",
    "for each fixed time @xmath38 define a graph @xmath5 by considering the induced subgraph of @xmath49 corresponding to vertices which are born at time @xmath50 or earlier , where we do not include vertices which would be isolated in @xmath5 .",
    "see figure [ fig1 ] for an illustration .",
    "the family of growing graphs @xmath30 just described includes classical dense @xmath15-random graphs ( up to isolated vertices ) and the sparse graphs studied in @xcite as special cases , and is ( except for minor technical differences ) identical to the family of random graphs studied in @xcite , a paper which was written in parallel with our paper ; see our remark at the end of this introduction .    the graphon process @xmath25 satisfies a natural notion of exchangeability .",
    "roughly speaking , in our setting this means that the features of newly born vertices are homogeneous in time .",
    "more precisely , it can be defined as joint exchangeability of a random measure in @xmath52 , where the two coordinates correspond to time , and each edge of the graph corresponds to a point mass .",
    "we will prove that graphon processes as defined above , with @xmath14 integrable and possibly random , are characterized by exchangeability of the random measure in @xmath52 along with a certain regularity condition we call _ uniform regularity of tails_. see proposition [ prop5 ] .",
    "this result is an analogue of the aldous - hoover theorem @xcite ( which characterizes @xmath15-random graphs over probability spaces as graphs which are invariant in law under permutation of their vertices ) in the setting of possibly sparse graphs satisfying the aforementioned regularity condition .",
    "the graphon processes defined above also have a number of other properties making them particularly natural to model sparse graphs or networks .",
    "they are suitable for modelling networks which grow over time since no additional rescaling parameters ( like the explicitly given density dependence on the number of vertices specified in @xcite ) are necessary ; all information about the random graph model is encoded by the graphon alone .",
    "the graphs are _ projective _ in the sense that if @xmath53 the graph @xmath54 is an induced subgraph of @xmath5 .",
    "finally , a closely related family of weighted graphs is proven in @xcite to have power law degree distribution for certain @xmath15 , and our graphon processes are expected to behave similarly .",
    "the graphon processes studied in this paper have a different qualitative behavior than the sparse @xmath15-random graphs studied in @xcite ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) , with the only overlap of the two theories occurring when the graphs are dense .",
    "if the sparsity of the graphs is caused by the degrees of the vertices being scaled down approximately uniformly over time , then the model in @xcite is most natural .",
    "if the sparsity is caused by later vertices typically having lower connectivity probabilities than earlier vertices , then the model presented in this paper is most natural .",
    "the sampling method we will use in the forthcoming paper @xcite generalizes both of these methods .",
