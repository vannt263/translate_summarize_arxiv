    "in recent years it has become clear that the gas - phase d / h ratio varies significantly from one sightline to another within a few hundred pc of the sun ( see , e.g. , moos et al .",
    "2002 ; steigman 2003 ; wood et al .  2004 ; hbrard 2005 ) .",
    "this has often been taken to result from regional variations in the extent to which nucleosynthesis in stars , followed by return of matter to the interstellar medium via stellar winds and ejecta , has lowered the interstellar d / h ratio from the primordial value established by nucleosynthesis in the big bang .",
    "i argue here that the observed local variations in the gas - phase d / h ratio are not due to variable astration .",
    "the low values of ( d / h)@xmath3 seen on some sightlines are instead attributed to incorporation of d into dust grains .",
    "i discuss processes acting to add d to dust grains , and show that these can strongly deuterate pah material in the interstellar medium .",
    "this hypothesis predicts a positive correlation of ( d / h)@xmath3 with gas - phase abundances of strongly - depleted metals , and deuteration of carbonaceous interstellar grains captured by the _ stardust _ mission .",
    "using high resolution spectroscopy with imaps , jenkins et al .",
    "( 1999 ) measured d / h=@xmath4ppm toward @xmath5  ori ( @xmath6pc ) , and sonneborn et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found d / h=@xmath7ppm toward @xmath8  vel ( @xmath9pc ) .",
    "these two high precision measurements firmly established the reality of substantial variations in the gas - phase d / h ratio within a few hundred pc of the sun . including observations with copernicus , imaps , hst , and fuse ( see the summary by wood et al .  2004 ) we now have measurements of d / h on @xmath040 interstellar sightlines , with d / h values ranging from @xmath10ppm toward @xmath11  car ( allen , jenkins , & snow 1992 ) to @xmath7ppm toward @xmath8  vel  a factor of @xmath04 variation in d / h .",
    "the gas returned to the ism from stars is expected to be nearly devoid of d , as the d is converted to @xmath12he during the pre - main - sequence evolution of @xmath13 stars ( mazzitelli & moretti 1980 ) . as a result , the d / h ratio in the ism is an indicator of the fraction of the baryons now in the ism that have passed through a star .",
    "if the primordial value of d / h is @xmath14ppm ( spergel et al .  2003 ) then a d / h ratio of @xmath10ppm would require that @xmath15 of the baryons in the interstellar gas toward @xmath11  car have been cycled through a star at least once , whereas on the sightline toward @xmath8  vel , this fraction would be only @xmath16 .",
    "the hypothesis that the observed variations in d / h on different sightlines are due to variations in astration therefore requires that ( 1 ) regions separated by only a few hundred pc have had extremely different star formation histories , and ( 2 ) turbulent diffusion has not homogenized the elemental abundances in the gas .",
    "it is difficult to see how these two conditions can be true : we do not see other evidence of such variations in star formation activity , and turbulent mixing is expected to be effective at mixing gas over length scales of hundreds of pc on @xmath17yr time scales .",
    "the gas returned to the ism from stars will , on average , be enriched in the products of stellar nucleosynthesis , such as oxygen .",
    "models for evolution of interstellar abundances due to stellar nucleosynthesis and infall predict the joint variation of d / h and o / h .",
    "outside of dark clouds , h@xmath18o is absent , and the o in grains is thought to be mostly in the form of amorphous olivine mg@xmath19fe@xmath20sio@xmath21 ( see draine 2003 ) . on typical sightlines 7099% of the si is in grains ( jenkins 2004 ) ; thus o@xmath22/o@xmath23(si / o)@xmath24(si / o)@xmath25 : the silicate grains contain @xmath26 of the oxygen ( for ( si / h)@xmath27ppm from asplund 2000 , and ( o / h)@xmath28ppm from asplund et al",
    ".  2004 ) .",
    "the gas phase oxygen abundance tracks the total oxygen abundance : ( o / h)@xmath29(o / h)@xmath30 .",
    "figure [ fig : dvso ] shows tracks of d / h vs.  o / h for two chemical evolution models ( chiappini , renda , & matteucci 2002 ) , where the degree of astration is a decreasing function of galactocentric radius .",
    "these models , which include infall , have o / h varying from 300 to 600@xmath1ppm as d / h declines by only @xmath31 .",
    "it is difficult to envision astration scenarios where d / h varies by a factor of 4 without associated very large variations in o / h .",
    "however , unlike the d / h ratio , the o / h ratio does _ not _ show large variations .",
    "figure [ fig : dvso ] shows measured values of ( d / h)@xmath3 and ( o / h)@xmath3 for 14 sightlines where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are all reported with 1-@xmath35 uncertainties not exceeding 0.10 dex . for this sample , the median",
    "( o / h)@xmath3 is @xmath36ppm and the median ( d / h)@xmath3 is @xmath37ppm .",
    "there is no indication of a significant anticorrelation between ( o / h)@xmath3 and ( d / h)@xmath3 :    * two of the three sightlines with the lowest values of ( d / h)@xmath3 ( @xmath5  ori and hd  191877 ) have ( o / h)@xmath3 _ below _ the median . * the sightline with the highest ( d / h)@xmath3 in this sample ( lse  234 ) has the second - highest ( o / h)@xmath3 .",
    "* the full ( factor of @xmath03 ) range of variation of ( d / h)@xmath3 is seen among the 6 sightlines with ( o / h)@xmath3 between 300 and @xmath38ppm ( @xmath5  ori , hd  191877 , @xmath39  ori , gd  246 , hz  43a , and feige  110 ) .    it therefore seems very unlikely that the observed variations in ( d / h)@xmath3 are due to variations in astration of the interstellar gas .",
    "if the ( d / h)@xmath3 variations are real , some other process must be responsible .",
    "when we observe variations in the gas - phase abundance of , say , si or fe from one local sightline to another , we do not attribute it to variable astration , but instead to variations in the fraction of the si and fe `` depleted '' from the gas by incorporation in solid dust particles .",
    "jura ( 1982 ) suggested that even d might perhaps be depleted from the gas phase and sequestered in dust grains . since",
    "1982 our picture of interstellar grains has evolved to include a substantial population of very small polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) grains ( see the review by draine 2003 ) .",
    "draine ( 2004 ) argued that carbonaceous interstellar grains could incorporate enough d atoms to substantially reduce the d abundance in the gas phase . under sufficiently violent conditions , the `` depleted '' d atoms could later be released from grains and returned to the gas .    in this interpretation",
    ", astration has reduced the d / h abundance from the primordial value to ( d / h)@xmath40ppm ; incorporation of some of the d into dust will then result in ( d / h)@xmath41 .",
    "the _ variations _ in the gas - phase d / h ratio are attributed to variations from one sightline to another in the fraction of the d sequestered in dust grains .",
    "measurement of the d / h ratio using ultraviolet spectroscopy is necessarily limited to sightlines through `` diffuse '' clouds with @xmath42mag .",
    "grains in clouds with @xmath43mag do not have h@xmath18o ice mantles ( whittet et al .  1988 ) ; the hydrogen present in diffuse cloud grains must be primarily in hydrocarbons .",
    "in fact , a broad absorption feature at 3.4@xmath44 m is observed and is identified as the c - h stretching mode in aliphatic hydrocarbons , although the amount of material necessary to account for the observed feature is uncertain ( see , e.g. , pendleton & allamandola 2002 ) .",
    "in addition to the 3.4@xmath44 m absorption feature , we also observe emission features at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , and 11.3@xmath44 m that are attributed to vibrationally - excited polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules .",
    "models that quantitatively reproduce the observed emission require substantial amounts of c in such particles ; the model of li & draine ( 2001 ) has c / h@xmath45ppm in pah grains containing @xmath46 c atoms refers to all of the h nucleons , including those in the gas . ]",
    "the larger pah grains are presumed to be clusters of smaller pah molecules .",
    "these might have c : h ratios in the range of 2:1  4:1 ( e.g. , coronene c@xmath47h@xmath48 to dicircumcoronene c@xmath49h@xmath47 ) .",
    "if so , the very small pah grains alone may contain h / h@xmath5020@xmath1ppm .",
    "how much c is in all of the grain material ? if it is assumed that the total interstellar c abundance is equal to current estimates of the solar abundance ( c / h=@xmath51ppm ; allende prieto , lambert , & asplund 2002 ) , then the difference between this value and the gas - phase abundances of ci and cii determined from absorption line measurements allow one to estimate that dust contains c / h@xmath52ppm ( jenkins 2004 ) .",
    "however , ( 1 ) solar abundances are uncertain , and ( 2 ) interstellar abundances may differ from solar abundances . when one seeks to construct a grain model to reproduce the observed extinction per h nucleon as a function of wavelength",
    ", one finds that in addition to silicate material , it is necessary to include a substantial amount of carbonaceous material .",
    "the dust model of weingartner & draine ( 2001a ) assumes c / h@xmath53ppm in dust ( including the small pah particles ) .",
    "the dust models of zubko , dwek & arendt ( 2004 ) use c / h@xmath54@xmath55ppm .",
    "pendleton & allamandola ( 2002 ) estimate that about 85% of the c in dust is aromatic ( @xmath56 bonding , e.g. , pahs and graphite ) , and 15% is aliphatic ( `` chain hydrocarbons '' ) .",
    "they estimate a c : h ratio @xmath02.9:1 for the aromatic material , and @xmath00.46:1 for the aliphatic material . for purposes of discussion",
    ", i will assume c / h@xmath57ppm and ( h+d)/h@xmath58ppm in aromatic hydrocarbon material , with an additional c / h@xmath59ppm and h / h@xmath60ppm in aliphatic material . because the smallest grains , which contribute most of the surface area , appear to be pahs ,",
    "i will focus on deuteration of the aromatic hydrocarbons alone , and neglect possible deuteration of the aliphatic material .",
    "observed values of ( d / h)@xmath3 range from @xmath022@xmath1ppm to @xmath61ppm.ppm toward @xmath8  vel ( sonneborn et al .",

    "1999 ) , @xmath64ppm toward lse 1274 ( wood et al .",
    "2004 ) . ] for dust to account for the variations in ( d / h)@xmath3 , the dust grains must be able to hold at least d / h@xmath65ppm . if the total amount of hydrogen in the aromatic material is h / h@xmath66ppm , then it must be possible to enrich the deuterium concentration to the point where ( d / h)@xmath67 .",
    "given that the overall d / h ratio is of order @xmath68 , processes must act to increase the d / h ratio in the dust by 4 orders of magnitude !",
    "examples of extreme deuteration are already known .",
    "for example , fragments of the hydrocarbon material in one interplanetary dust particle ( idp ) analyzed in the laboratory have d / h @xmath69 ( messenger 2000 ) . in some molecular cloud cores , extreme deuteration of small gas - phase molecules",
    "is seen , e.g. , d@xmath18co",
    "/ h@xmath18co = 0.01  0.1 ( ceccarelli et al .  2001 ; bacmann et al .",
    "2003 ) , nh@xmath18d / nh@xmath70 = 0.07 ( shah & wooten 2001 ) , nd@xmath70/nh@xmath710.001 ( lis et al . 2002 ; van der tak et al .",
    "2002 ) , and ch@xmath18doh / ch@xmath70oh@xmath72 ( parisi et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "sandford , bernstein , & dworkin ( 2001 ) discussed 4 processes that could lead to deuterium enrichment in carbonaceous material : low - temperature gas phase ion - molecule reactions ; low - temperature gas - grain reactions ; uv photon absorption followed by ejection of h ; and deuteration of carbon molecules embedded in d - rich ices .",
    "i focus here on processes that can deuterate grains in diffuse clouds , and show that d could be removed from the gas on timescales as short as a few myr .      while h and d have the same electronic structure , and therefore the same `` chemistry '' , the c - d bond is stronger than the c - h bond because of the reduced zero - point energy .",
    "it is easy to estimate the magnitude of this energy difference . to be specific ,",
    "let us consider pah molecules , since we have direct evidence that at least some of the solid carbon is in this form .",
    "pahs show three emission features associated with vibrations of the c - h bond : the c - h stretch at @xmath73 m , in - plane c - h bending at @xmath74 m , and out - of - plane c - h bending at @xmath75 m .",
    "the stretching and bending modes can be approximated as harmonic oscillators .",
    "if the h is replaced by d , the reduced mass of the c - h oscillator will increase by a factor 13/7 , and the frequency will be reduced by a factor @xmath76 .",
    "each of the vibrational modes has zero - point energy @xmath77 associated with it , so ( summing over the three modes ) the zero - point energy will be lowered by @xmath78 therefore it is energetically favorable for the h in pahs to be replaced by d. if atomic h and d in the gas were in thermodynamic equilibrium with deuterated pah material at temperature @xmath79 , we would expect to have @xmath80 where the inequality is because we may not reach a steady - state , and there may be other processes acting to return d to the gas .",
    "now suppose that ( d / h)@xmath30=22@xmath1ppm .",
    "if the aromatic grains contain d / h@xmath81ppm and h / h@xmath82ppm , eq .",
    "( [ eq : condition on tdust ] ) becomes @xmath83 or @xmath84 = 91$]k .",
    "the ism is , of course , far from lte , so thermodyamic arguments are suspect . nevertheless ,",
    "since interstellar grain material is generally at temperatures @xmath85k , we can at least contemplate the possibility that pah grains exposed to atomic h and d might attain d : h ratios as high as @xmath00.3 .",
    "it can easily be shown that thermal desorption also can not be important .",
    "at such temperature @xmath86k , the rate for thermal desorption of chemically - bound h in pahs is entirely negligible .",
    "therefore it does not appear that the required degree of deuteration can be achieved by the thermal desorption process discussed by allamandola , tielens , & barker ( 1989 ) .    because grains can catalyze h@xmath18 formation , it is important to note that the energy difference @xmath87 is 0.048  ev smaller than @xmath88 , so that it is energetically favorable to leave the d attached to c and instead abstract an h to form h@xmath18 rather than hd ( 2.4@xmath44 m is the wavelength of h@xmath181 - 0 q branch lines ) .",
    "thus even if the h@xmath18 formation process involves hydrogen abstraction , h@xmath18 will be strongly favored over formation of hd , leaving d atoms chemically bound in the hydrocarbon grain .",
    "this differs from the prediction by lipshtat , biham , & herbst ( 2004 ) of enhanced hd and d@xmath18 formation if h and d are only physisorbed on the grain surface .",
    "now the key question is : can we imagine a kinetic pathway whereby extreme deuteration of grains might come about ?      while it is known that pahs can form in the high - temperature chemistry of flames , the processes responsible for the formation of interstellar pahs and other carbonaceous material remain unclear .",
    "we will assume that at the time of their formation , the carbon solids are minimally deuterated , incorporating h and d approximately in proportion to gas - phase abundances .",
    "given that carbonaceous grains incorporate only @xmath0145@xmath1ppm of all of the hydrogen , a negligible fraction of the d would initially be trapped in pahs .    for grains to become heavily deuterated , it is necessary that    1 .",
    "d or d@xmath89 arriving at a carbonaceous grain must have a significant probability of being incorporated into the grain ; 2 .",
    "d that has been incorporated must not be removed by exchange reactions with arriving h or h@xmath89  if this were to happen with any appreciable probability , the steady - state abundance of d in the grain would be very low .",
    "we consider conditions in cold hi clouds ( the `` cold neutral medium '' , or cnm ) , with density @xmath90 , electron density @xmath91 , with perhaps 1/3 of the electrons contributed by ionized metals , and 2/3 by ionized hydrogen .",
    "thus the hydrogen ionization fraction @xmath92 ; because of rapid charge exchange , deuterium will have the same ionization fraction .",
    "we take the local average starlight background .",
    "impinging low - energy d atoms are probably unable to react chemically with an already saturated neutral hydrocarbon ",
    "the arriving d will most likely be physisorbed or chemisorbed on the surface of the neutral pah , from which it can subsequently be removed by reacting with an arriving h to form hd , or by thermal desorption following heating of the pah by photon absorption .",
    "as discussed by bauschlicher ( 1998 ) for the naphthalene cation c@xmath93h@xmath94 , a d atom can react with a pah cation , producing a hydro - pah cation , with two hydrogens sharing a single carbon ( see figure [ fig : react ] ) .",
    "how rapidly will this occur ?",
    "it is not known if thermal d atoms will react with pahs much larger than naphthalene if they are only singly or doubly charged , so let us consider only pah cations containing @xmath95 c atoms .",
    "collision cross sections are estimated following draine & sutin ( 1987 ) , the pah size distribution is from li & draine ( 2001 ) and weingartner & draine ( 2001a ) , and the pah charge distribution is estimated following weingartner & draine ( 2001b ) . for a neutral d in the cnm , i find the rate to collide and react with pah cations containing @xmath96 atoms is @xmath97 ; if the probability of reaction is of order unity , and there is no process returning d to the gas phase , then the gas - phase d abundance in the cnm would decline by a factor @xmath98 in only @xmath99myr .",
    "another pathway begins with d@xmath89 colliding with a neutral ( or negative ) pah ; the d@xmath89 will arrive at the pah with sufficient kinetic energy that atomic rearrangements can take place among the peripheral hydrogens near the point of impact .",
    "the excess energy will be thermalized in the vibrational modes ; the collision complex is expected to maximize its binding energy by an exchange reaction that would replace a c - h bond with a c - d bond , thus incorporating the d and creating a hydro - pah cation just as for the case of a neutral d colliding with a pah cation .",
    "it seems likely that every arriving d@xmath89 ion will be incorporated into the pah via this pathway , thus deuterating the pah and removing d from the gas .",
    "the rate for species @xmath100 to collide with a grain can be written @xmath101 , where @xmath102 depends on the pah charge distribution .",
    "ions have relatively high rates for collisions with neutral pahs because of the induced polarization interaction , and even higher rates for negative pah ions because of coulomb focussing .",
    "weingartner & draine ( 2001c ) estimated @xmath103 in the cnm ; @xmath104 will be smaller by @xmath105 , @xmath106 .",
    "thus the rate for d nuclei to react with a grain by this pathway is @xmath107 .",
    "this is a factor of 16 slower than the rate for d nuclei to react with pah cations , and therefore is of only secondary importance .",
    "together , the gas - phase processes appear able to remove d from the gas , and deuterate pahs , on a time scale of @xmath108myr .",
    "evolution of the grain population is not well understood , but it appears that the larger grains move relative to the gas with speeds of @xmath109 resulting from mhd turbulence ( yan et al .",
    "this can sweep up the pahs on @xmath110yr timescales and incorporate them into larger grains ; occasional shattering of larger carbonaceous grains when they collide replenishes the pah population . in this scenario ,",
    "all of the aromatic grain material eventually becomes enriched with d , not just the fraction that is instantaneously present in small free - flying pahs .",
    "the proposed extreme deuteration of pah material imposes strong requirements on branching ratios for reactions of pah material with impinging h and d atoms and ions , and is therefore subject to laboratory test .",
    "in particular , an experiment with low energy d@xmath89 impinging on partially - deuterated pah material should have a high probability of incorporating the d into the solid , while reactions of low energy h@xmath89 with the same sample should have a very small probability of abstracting d from the sample .",
    "grains do nt last forever  sputtering and grain - grain collisions following the passage of @xmath111 shock waves can return atoms  including d  from the solid to the gas phase .",
    "when this occurs , ( d / h)@xmath3 should increase , along with the gas - phase abundances of other elements , such as si , ti , and fe , that are normally strongly depleted . the hypothesis that dust is responsible for the observed variations in (",
    "d / h)@xmath3 therefore predicts that the gas - phase abundances of si , ti , fe and other refractory metals should show a positive correlation with the gas - phase abundance of d.    this prediction appears to be confirmed by a recent study finding a positive correlation between ( d / h)@xmath3 and ( fe / h)@xmath3 ( linsky et al .",
    "the emission features at 3.3 , 8.6 , and 11.3@xmath44 m provide direct spectroscopic evidence for the presence of c - h bonds in vibrationally - excited interstellar pah material .",
    "can c - d bonds be observed through corresponding emission features ?",
    "the c - d in - plane bending mode at @xmath112 would be confused with the c - h out - of - plane bending modes at @xmath113 , and the out - of - plane bending mode at @xmath114 falls in a region where other pah features ( c - c skeleton modes ) are present .",
    "the best hope appears to be the c - d stretching mode at @xmath115 .",
    "in fact , peeters et al .  ( 2004 ) report detection of weak emission features at 4.4@xmath44 m and 4.68@xmath44 m from the orion bar and m17 photodissociation regions .",
    "identification of the features as due to c - d is uncertain , but if the features are indeed due to c - d modes , peeters et al.estimate ( d / h)@xmath116 in orion and @xmath117 in m17 .",
    "these d / h values are just in the range that we have estimated above to be necessary to lower ( d / h)@xmath3 to the observed values",
    "!    additional spectroscopy of the emission from pdrs in the 45@xmath44 m region to confirm these detections and identifications would be of great value .",
    "unfortunately , the irs instrument on spitzer only works longward of 5.2@xmath44 m .",
    "detection of absorption features produced by deuterated pah material is unpromising , because absorption by the c - h stretching mode in aromatic hydrocarbons is quite weak  even the 3.3@xmath44 m aromatic c - h stretch feature has not been seen in absorption .",
    "detection of the 4.5@xmath118 c - d stretch in absorption does not appear to be possible .",
    "the c - d bending modes will also be too weak to detect , and in any case would be confused with other pah modes , as discussed above .",

    "if it has collected grain material that is representative of the interstellar grain population , this would be expected to have d / h @xmath123 if dust is responsible for the observed variations in ( d / h)@xmath3 ; the aromatic component of such grains , if isolated , might have an even higher d / h ratio .",
    "laboratory measurements of d / h in the returned interstellar grain samples will test this hypothesis .",
    "as noted above (  [ sec : observations ] ) , idps are sometimes seen to be strongly deuterated .",
    "the largest d / h ratio seen thus far is @xmath124 ( messenger 2000 ) . if interstellar grains have d / h ratios as large as @xmath125 , as proposed here , why are these not seen in idps that are thought to originate in comets ?",
    "first , while the median ( d / h)@xmath126ppm in figure [ fig : dvso ] , two of the 14 sightlines have ( d / h)@xmath127ppm . presumably this material was shocked relatively recently .",
    "perhaps the solar system formed out of such matter 4.5@xmath1gyr ago .",
    "second , while comets are thought to be made of relatively primitive material , it is possible that accretion into the solar nebula might involve a phase with sufficiently high temperatures and densities for significant exchange of h and d with the gas to take place , thereby lowering the d / h ratio in the grains .",

    "the lack of correlation between ( d / h)@xmath3 and ( o / h)@xmath3 in figure [ fig : dvso ] argues strongly against variations in astration as the explanation for the observed variation in ( d / h)@xmath3 .",

    "<S> the d / h ratio in interstellar gas varies on scales of a few hundred pc in the local milky way , with d / h values ranging from @xmath07@xmath1ppm to @xmath022@xmath1ppm . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction in d / h relative to the primordial value of d / h@xmath2ppm is usually attributed to `` astration ''  conversion of d into other elements by nuclear fusion in stars . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is shown here that astration has difficulty accounting for the observations because the expected associated variations in o / h are not seen .    the lower d / h values are instead likely due to `` depletion '' of the d onto dust grains . </S>",
    "<S> polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) are a possible repository for the missing d , and it appears possible for gas - grain reactions to achieve extreme deuteration of carbonaceous grain material . </S>",
    "<S> grain destruction will release d from the grains ; the gas phase abundance of d should therefore be positively correlated with the gas phase abundances of other elements that exhibit strong depletions , such as mg , si , ti , and fe , which also will be returned to the gas by grain destruction . </S>"
