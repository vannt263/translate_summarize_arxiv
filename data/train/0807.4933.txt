    "a reliable method of measuring the physical distance to astrophysical objects has always been sought after in observational astronomy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in the era of `` precision cosmology '' , the need for accurate physical distance measurements has been amplified ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "accurate and precise distance indicators hold the key to pinning down the value of the hubble constant @xmath6 and many other cosmological parameters ( see discussion in , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a number of methods have been employed to determine extragalactic distances , with varying degree of success ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the construction and reliability of the `` cosmological distance ladder '' depends crucially on cepheid variables being able to provide precise and accurate distances to nearby ( @xmath7mpc ) galaxies .",
    "the quest for such distances has been an arduous journey for almost a hundred years , with many dramatic twists and turns ( for a review of early years , see * ? ? ? * for a recent review see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "cepheids offer several advantages as distance indicators .",
    "massive stars @xmath8 make an excursion through the instability strip and most , if not all , of them become cepheid variables .",
    "these variable stars are relatively bright ( @xmath9 for a @xmath10day cepheid ) and often have large brightness variations ( amplitude @xmath11 mag ) with a characteristic `` saw - tooth '' shaped light curve .",
    "their intrinsic brightness , combined with their light curve shape and colors , make them easy to distinguish from other classes of variable stars . as a result",
    ", cepheids have been detected and studied in a significant number of star - forming galaxies .",
    "the physical mechanisms underlying cepheid pulsation are well understood , including the observed tight period - luminosity ( pl ) relationship ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the small scatter in the pl relation allows distance measurements precise to @xmath12 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for these reasons",
    ", cepheids are commonly used to calibrate other distance indicators , forming the base of the cosmological distance ladder .    despite their many advantages as a distance indicator",
    ", cepheid distances also have some shortcomings .",
    "most cepheids have an intrinsic brightness of @xmath13 , so with the current instrumentation they can be only used to measure distances to @xmath14mpc ( the largest cepheid distance in @xcite is @xmath15mpc ) .",
    "observations of cepheids in distant galaxies are also hindered by blending @xcite as young stars , cepheids live in close proximity to the crowded star - forming regions of their host galaxies , and are thus likely to have another star of similar brightness on the scale of a typical instrumental point - spread - function ( psf ) .",
    "the effect of blending becomes worse as the square of the distance to the host galaxy @xcite , again limiting the usefulness of cepheids to measuring distances @xmath14mpc even with high resolution instruments such as the hubble space telescopes ( _ hst _ ) .",
    "ideally , we would like to find a distance indicator that shares the good properties of classical cepheids , but is even more luminous , allowing us to observe it further away and be less susceptible to blending .",
    "in this paper we discuss such a possible distance indicator , namely ultra long period ( ulp ) cepheids .",
    "we define ulp cepheids as fundamental mode cepheids with pulsation periods greater than 80 days .",
    "several such cepheids have been already discovered in the pioneering study of @xcite .",
    "however , ulp cepheids have traditionally been ignored for distance measurements as they are pl outliers .",
    "indeed , the observed pl relation flattens for cepheids with periods greater than 100 days ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite suggests that long period leavitt variables could be used for distance measures unfortunately that idea has not permeated through the community .",
    "we argue that the flattening of the pl at long periods actually improves the usefulness of ulp cepheids as distance indicators because it makes them a good standard candle in the traditional sense .",
    "we note several additional advantages of ulp cepheids over lower period cepheids due to their increased luminosity .",
    "ulp cepheids could be used as a stellar distance measure to the hubble flow ( up to @xmath16 mpc) several times the current observational limit . in section  [ sec : sample ] we describe our sample compiled from the literature .",
    "the ulp cepheid pl relation is discussed in section  [ sec : dm ] .",
    "section  [ sec : massloss ] demonstrates how ulp cepheids may provide the additional benefit of testing massive stellar evolutionary models .",
    "we summarize our results in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",

    "the first and third crossings are associated with positive @xmath271 while cepheids exhibit a decreasing period on their second crossing .",
    "we investigated the light curves of our sample for signs of period changes by comparing photometry taken over the last @xmath272 years .",
    "one ulp cepheid , hv829 , exhibits a negative period change of about 1.5 days . for this cepheid",
    ", we compiled photometric data taken during 1970 - 1976 from @xcite and @xcite and 2000 - 2004 data from the asas catalog ( see figure  [ fig : dpdt ] ) .",
    "this result is confirmed by a measured period of @xmath273 days in @xcite and 85.2 days by @xcite , firmly establishing hv829 as a cepheid on its second crossing .",
    "no other cepheid in our sample exhibited a measurable period change .",
    "ulp cepheids occupy a mass range that is ideal to probe high mass evolutionary models along the instability strip .",
    "we plot the cmd of our ulp cepheid sample and overlay the evolutionary tracks of @xcite ( figure  [ fig : mass ] ) .",
    "the location of ulp cepheids in the color magnitude diagram suggest masses between @xmath274 and @xmath275 , depending on the assumed metallicity ( here , we choose smc metallicity ) .",
    "our sample clearly probes a mass range unexplored by current cepheid studies .",
    "note the evolutionary tracks at @xmath276 and @xmath275 only cross the instability strip once , regardless of assumed mass - loss rate .",
    "however , we have shown and confirmed that hv829 is undergoing its _ second _ crossing ; a result at odds with the models .",
    "we note that the evolutionary model represents some `` mean '' behavior based on assumptions of stellar chemical composition , overshooting , and other parameters .",
    "nevertheless , our result is one of the few observational constraints on high mass stellar evolutionary models .",
    "hv829 may indicate that massive stars behave differently than expected .",
    "future stellar evolutionary models in this mass regime should take this into account .",
    "we have presented , for the first time , a collection of ultra long period ( @xmath277days ) cepheids from the literature and demonstrated their viability as a distance indicator . in the past",
    ", ulp cepheids have been ignored as distance indicators , and in fact many stellar variability searches did not extend their cadence and search strategy to allow for their discovery .    in @xmath188 , @xmath189 , and especially reddening - free w@xmath3 magnitude ,",
    "ulp cepheids have a relatively flat pl relation compared to the respective relations for classical cepheids @xcite . the dispersion in both the classical and ulp cepheid populations about their respective pl relationships becomes smaller as one moves from @xmath188 to @xmath189 to w@xmath3 , and the discrepancy between the slopes increases .",
    "most notably , the slope of the ulp cepheid w@xmath3 pl relation is significantly shallower than the standard smc pl relation ( slope is @xmath278 vs. @xmath242 ) .",
    "the reddening - free wesenheit index produces the tightest ulp pl relation , with rms residual of only @xmath4 mag ( see figure  [ fig : pl ] ) .",
    "other papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have found non - linearites in the pl relationship at lower periods . however , the change in slope seen here is much more dramatic and it is unlikely that it shares a physical connection with the pl changes at lower periods .",
    "our ulp pl scatter in w@xmath3 is already less than that of the initial peak brightness vs. absolute magnitude relation for type ia supernova ( @xmath279 mag ; @xcite ) .",
    "a huge amount of effort has been necessary to increase the number of observed type ia sne , refine the calibration technique ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and to obtain the low @xmath280-@xmath281 mag scatter in the relation seen today ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we expect future observational and theoretical studies of ulp cepheids will further decrease the already fairly small scatter found in this first analysis .",
    "we strove to find all the known ulp cepheids in the literature , but our sample is likely not a complete census of ulp cepheids .",
    "we note that the araucaria project found ulp cepheids in three of the five galaxies they observed at the time of this analysis , so the ulp cepheid sample should grow at a reasonable rate as cepheid studies are extended to more galaxies and previous data sets are reanalyzed with longer period searches .",
    "there is also evidence ulp cepheids exist in a broad range of metallicities , as preliminary data analysis of a m81 variability survey with the large binocular telescope has already discovered at least one ulp cepheid ( kochanek , private communication ) .",
    "in addition to following a fairly tight pl relation , the ulp cepheids are also very luminous , with a median absolute magnitude in @xmath189(@xmath188 ) for our sample of @xmath282 . using wfpc3 ,",
    "_ hst _ can obtain @xmath283 photometry at @xmath284 or @xmath285 ( dm @xmath286  distance of @xmath287mpc for the median ulp cepheid ) in about 10 orbits , while only two orbits are needed to reach a dm of @xmath288 .",
    "as one would only need a few orbits per epoch , one could detect the median ulp cepheid ( with a period of @xmath289 days ) at 100 mpc and the brightest ulp cepheids at @xmath16 mpc in a reasonable amount of time .",
    "since the luminosity of an ulp cepheid is a weak function of its period , relatively accurate distances would not require as precise period measurements as is needed for classical cepheids .",
    "we encourage future variability proposals to search for cepheids with periods greater than 100 days .",
    "we note two concerns in using ulp cepheids for distance measurements .",
    "it is obvious from our sample size that ulp cepheids are far less common than classical cepheids .",
    "the relatively small ulp cepheid population will make precision distance measurements less practical .",
    "as the sample size grows and the ulp cepheid pl relations become established , a single ulp cepheid observation may yield distance measurements accurate to @xmath290 .",
    "blending is always a concern in cepheid studies .",
    "blending can compromise classical cepheid measurements as stars of comparable brightness are likely to lie within a single psf @xcite , especially at larger distances .",
    "we expect blending to be less of a problem for our ulp cepheids even at large distances simply because they are so bright and there are very few stars of comparable brightness in a given galaxy . the effect of blending on ulp cepheid observations will need to be investigated further as the sample is increased .",
    "the data set and analysis herein provides meaningful constraints on theoretical work on cepheids in this mass and period range .",
    "we have shown that ulp cepheids show strong evidence for a different , flatter pl relation than their lower period cousins .",
    "several papers have modeled cepheid pulsations and mapped these to theoretical pl relations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , this work has not been reliably extended to the period range of our sample .",
    "pulsation models in this period range would also help determine the intrinsic scatter to the pl@xmath227 relation .",
    "our current sample is not large enough to constrain the sensitivity of the ulp cepheid pl to metallicity .",
    "the pl residuals as a function of metallicity are consistent with the results for shorter period cepheids ( @xmath291 mag dex@xmath255 ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that the median @xmath195o / h@xmath250 value for a galaxy in our sample is about @xmath292dex lower than the corresponding value for the _ hst _ key project cepheid hosts .",
    "period changes of ulp cepheids have powerful implications for stellar evolutionary models in this mass regime .",
    "we examined photometry from two epochs separated by thirty years to check for evidence of period changes in seven magellanic cloud ulp cepheids .",
    "only one , smc hv829 , showed a significant period change from @xmath293 to @xmath294 days .",
    "the negative period derivative indicates that the cepheid is undergoing its second crossing .",
    "assuming the metallicity of the smc , many current evolutionary models do not predict second crossings for cepheids in this mass range ( see figure  [ fig : mass ] ) .",
    "future models should incorporate this observational result as it should place limits on several key input parameters .",
    "in addition to their potential as distance indicators , ulp cepheids provide observational constraints on high mass stellar evolution models .",
    "to summarize , ulp cepheids , while often dismissed in the past , are potentially a powerful distance indicator , probe of pl metallicity sensitivity , and also a probe of massive star evolutionary models .",
    "ulp cepheids could provide the first direct stellar distance measurements to galaxies in the 50 - 150 mpc range , extending the cosmological distance ladder well into the hubble flow .",
