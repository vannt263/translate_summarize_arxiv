    "the surface of the moon is constellated by impact craters of various sizes , mainly generated from the collision of objects coming from the main asteroid belt .",
    "indeed , the inner solar system can be reached by such minor bodies as a consequence of different types of resonance @xcite .",
    "the intense lunar bombardment took place between 3.8 and 4 gy ago , being at the present day the meteroidal flux about @xmath4 lower @xcite .",
    "the cratering process is interesting for several branches of science .",
    "first of all , by comparing densities of craters on different surfaces it is possible to derive the relative age of the corresponding terrains ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . roughly speaking , the greater the density the older the surface .",
    "also , the geological chronology of the terrestrial planets is now becoming more and more accurate thanks to the space missions that provide radiometric age estimates for different regions .",
    "this is especially true if we take as reference case the moon , for which a great amount of data is now available . from this kind of analysis , new insight on the solar system evolution",
    "can be obtained .",
    "as further aspect , the flux of impacts offers information on the solar system minor bodies population .",
    "the main problem in all these studies resides on the fact that the crater formation is a phenomenon not fully understood yet .",
    "there does not exist a predictive , quantitative model of crater formation , that is , a reliable methodology that can be applied to all situations .",
    "the size of the crater that forms at the end of the excavation stage depends on the asteroid s size , speed and composition , on the collision angle , on the material and structure of the surface in which the crater forms and on the surface gravity of the target @xcite .",
    "the problem in the determination of the crater s dimension concerns with the poorness of the experimental or observational data .",
    "this difficulty is usually overcome by extrapolating beyond experimental knowledge through scaling laws .",
    "this work regards the paths that impacting asteroids might have followed .",
    "in particular , we will deal with low - energy trajectories , first derived in the circular restricted three ",
    "body problem ( cr3bp ) framework applied to the earth ",
    "moon system and then analysed also accounting for the sun gravitational attraction by means of the bicircular restricted four  body problem ( br4bp ) .",
    "we assume the minor bodies to have already left the main asteroid belt and we consider as main entrance to the earth ",
    "moon neighbourhood the stable invariant manifold associated with the central invariant manifold corresponding to the @xmath0 equilibrium point .",
    "we will look for the distribution of impacts that such orbits can create , paying attention to the fact that the moon is locked in a @xmath5 spin  orbit resonance .",
    "in particular , we wonder if , for the range of energy under consideration , the moon acts as a shield for the earth or if the greatest concentration of collisions still takes place on the leading side of the surface , as other authors have pointed out with different approaches .",
    "see , for example , @xcite .    in a second step , from a backward integration , we attempt at discovering any other gate that can lead to a lunar impact within low - energy regimes .",
    "we recall that due to the small values of energy we consider , the impacts obtained can yield to at most @xmath6 km in diameter craters .",
    "this value has been computed by applying the scaling laws of melosh @xcite to the moon s surface with an impact velocity corresponding to the escape lunar velocity ( about @xmath7 km@xmath8s ) .",
    "the circular restricted three ",
    "body problem @xcite studies the behaviour of a particle @xmath9 with infinitesimal mass @xmath10 moving under the gravitational attraction of two primaries @xmath11 and @xmath12 , of masses @xmath13 and @xmath14 , revolving around their center of mass in circular orbits .    to remove time from the equations of motion , it is convenient to introduce a synodical reference system @xmath15 , which rotates around the @xmath16axis with a constant angular velocity @xmath17 equal to the mean motion @xmath18 of the primaries",
    ". the origin of the reference frame is set at the barycenter of the system and the @xmath19axis on the line which joins the primaries , oriented in the direction of the largest primary . in this way we work with @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    "fixed on the @xmath19axis .",
    "the units are chosen in such a way that the distance between the primaries and the modulus of the angular velocity of the rotating frame are unitary .",
    "we define the mass ratio @xmath20 as @xmath21 for the earth ",
    "moon system @xmath22 .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath9 can be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] and @xmath25^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] are the distances from @xmath9 to @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the system ( [ eq:1 ] ) has a first integral , the jacobi integral , which is given by @xmath28 in the synodical reference system , there exist five equilibrium or _ libration _ points .",
    "three of them , the collinear ones , are in the line joining the primaries and are usually denoted by @xmath29 , @xmath0 and @xmath30 . if @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) denotes the abscissa of the three collinear points , we assume that @xmath33 let @xmath34 be the value of the jacobi constant at the @xmath35 equilibrium point .",
    "we have the following relation @xmath36    depending on the value of the jacobi constant , it is possible to define where the particle can move in the configuration space .",
    "these regions are known as hill s regions and their boundaries are the zero - velocity surfaces . for a given mass parameter ,",
    "there exist five different geometric configurations , corresponding to five different energy levels .",
    "if @xmath37 , the infinitesimal mass can just move either in a neighbourhood around the largest primary or in a small neighbourhood around the smallest one .",
    "if @xmath38 , it can move from the neighbourhood of one primary to the neighbourhood of the other one .",
    "if @xmath39 , it occurs the so  called _ bottleneck _ configuration , that is , the accessible region opens up beyond @xmath14 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath9 can go toward @xmath29 and @xmath30 when @xmath40 .",
    "finally , if @xmath41 there are not forbidden regions . in fig .  [ fig:1 ] , we represent the intersections of the zero - velocity surfaces with the @xmath42 plane .",
    "these intersections are known as zero - velocity curves .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     though we are aware that a deeper analysis using longer time intervales should be performed , significant results have already been obtained .",
    "they can be summarized as follows :    * the percentage of impact depends on @xmath1 and on the initial phase of the sun , @xmath2 : this is displayed in tab .",
    "[ tab:2 ] ; * some trajectories collide with the earth , the corresponding percentage is also shown in tab .",
    "[ tab:2 ] ; * looking to tab .",
    "[ tab:2 ] , it is also clear that there exist values of @xmath2 more favorable to yield impacts with the moon , while the earth s percentage of impact has an almost constant trend ; * it looks like the relative earth  moon and earth  moon  sun distances , as well as",
    "the adimensional diameter of the moon play a significant role in what concerns with the region of heavier lunar impact .",
    "in particular , the leading side collision concentration becomes more and more evident as @xmath1 decreases .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] , we show the density of impact obtained when @xmath43 and @xmath44 km , respectively . for these plots , we consider @xmath45 , @xmath46 and the distribution deriving from all the values of @xmath2 evaluated .",
    "as final remark , we note that all the simulation performed are quite expensive from a computational point of view , but that it was not an objective of this work to implement optimal programs .",
    "we use the upc applied math cluster system , which consists in 26 dell poweredge sc1425 servers , each with two intel xeon 3.2 ghz processors and 2 gb of ram . in particular , we carry on parallel computations , using a node for each level of energy considered . in this way , the full computations for the cr3bp case take about 6 hours , for the br4bp one about 1 day and the computations described in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] about 1 hour and 50 minutes . in all the numerical integrations",
    ", we adopt a 7 - 8 runge - kutta - fehlberg method .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to establish a relationship between low - energy trajectories in the earth ",
    "moon system and lunar impact craters .",
    "this is actually a quite wide and challenging topic , which involves knowledge related to mathematics , astronomy and geology .    as primary goal",
    ", we define some tools which are effective in the determination of the dynamics pushing a massless particle under low - energy regimes .",
    "we exploit invariant objects within the circular restricted three  body problem approximation , in particular transit trajectories lying inside the stable invariant manifold associated with the central invariant manifold of the @xmath0 equilibrium point .",
    "we implement a method that allows to reproduce the behaviour associated with the unstable component of any central orbit and does not need to distinguish between them .",
    "this fits with our investigation , because we are interested in minor bodies collisions that take advantage of the channels represented by the whole hyperbolic manifolds . to this purpose ,",
    "we adopt well - known procedures to compute periodic lyapunov orbits together with their hyperbolic invariant manifolds .    with this approach , we perform extensive numerical simulations to determine both the lunar region of heavier impact and the sources of a potential uniform craters distribution .",
    "we also look for the influence of the sun on these paths , by means of the bicircular restricted four  body problem .",
    "several outcomes can be highlighted , even if they have to be seen as patterns that require a more robust proof : further calculations with different dynamical and astronomical models are in progress .",
    "the investigation carried out is promising from many points of view , as it indicates future developments that are worth to be considered .    without the effect of the sun ,",
    "we get a confirmation that the neighbourhood of the apex of the surface of the moon is the region where most collisions take place .",
    "we remark that the impact trajectories simulated reach the surface of the moon with the lowest possible velocity : this point does not corrupt the apex concentration that other authors discovered without this restriction .",
    "the total time span considered ( 60 years ) is sufficient to describe the general behaviour of the massless particles and no distinctions among different values for the earth ",
    "moon distance were observed",
    ".    however , the gravitational force exerted by the sun seems to blur the above phenomenon . changing the ratio between the earth ",
    "sun distance and the earth ",
    "moon one , we notice different patterns . from our computations , it turns out that in more ancient epochs the low - energy lunar impacts were focused on the moon leading side , but this is not true going further in time .",
    "moreover , we get evidence that the position of the sun with respect to the earth  moon barycenter affects the distribution of lunar impacts .",
    "these are the first aspects we plan to study with more detail .",
    "for instance , it would be deserving to integrate the br4bp equations of motion for a longer interval of time and for a greater number of values of the initial phase of the sun to understand the real nature of these numerical observations .",
    "on the other hand , we realize that small craters can also be generated by the impact of dust arising from more energetic collisions than the ones investigated here .",
    "such phenomenon comes from the existence of periodic orbits that cross the surface of the moon , that is , double collision orbits . in the future",
    ", we would like to see how they are transformed by the perturbation of the sun .",
    "a natural step would be to add the gravitational attractions of other planets to see their consequences on the orbits simulated .",
    "this will be done by means of a restricted n  body problem , using position and velocity of the primaries given by the jpl ephemerides ( for instance the de405 ones ) and taking several initial epochs to compare the whole outcome .",
    "moreover , we would like to link our methodology with real observational data , concerning either the existing lunar craters and the orbital parameters at a certain epoch of a given set of near earth objects .",
    "this information would affect especially the way we generate the initial conditions corresponding to transit orbits .",
    "finally , to apply the same kind of analysis to the terrestrial planets would be of large interest .",
    "starting from the cr3bp approximation , we mean to study the density of impact provided by sun ",
    "planet low - enery orbits and then to add further gravitational effects , trying to figure out the orbital elements and also the regions in the phase space which more likely lead to collision .",
