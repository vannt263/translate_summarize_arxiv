    "investigation of the qcd phase transition at finite temperature and density is one of most important subjects in particle and nuclear physics . to create the quark gluon plasma phase ( qgp ) , in which quarks and gluons are deconfined and the chiral symmetry is restored , the high energy heavy ion collision experiments have been performed and the rhic experiment at bnl is in progress .",
    "the @xmath2 suppression has been considered as one of most important signals of formation of qgp phase . however , theoretical understanding of this phenomenon is still not sufficient to draw a conclusive scenario .",
    "we investigate the charmonium properties at finite temperature using lattice qcd simulations which enable us to incorporate the nonperturbative effects of qcd from the first principle . in this paper",
    ", we report our results of three such approaches : ( _ a _ ) a nonrelativistic potential model analysis with the static quark potential measured in lattice qcd , ( _ b _ ) the spatial correlation between quark and antiquark @xcite , and ( _ c _ ) direct reconstruction of the spectral function from lattice data of correlators using the maximum entropy method and the standard @xmath3 analysis @xcite . at present stage",
    ", all these works are done in the quenched approximation ( without dynamical quark effects ) . to circumvent severe restriction of degrees of freedom in euclidean temporal direction",
    ", we employ the anisotropic lattice on which temporal lattice spacing is finer than the spatial one ( for setup of anisotropic lattice , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the results of these analyses are summarized as follows .",
    "although the simple potential model analysis ( _ a _ ) indicate that there is no bound state above @xmath1 , the latter two analyses imply that the structure of qcd plasma is much involved and persistent collective modes may exist .",
    "the static quark potential @xmath4 is determined in lattice qcd simulation .",
    "it is extracted from the spatial correlation of the polyakov loops , @xmath5 : @xmath6 as displayed in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] , the results above @xmath1 are well fitted to the yukawa - type form , @xmath7 , with the screening length @xmath8 . the obtained value of @xmath9 at each temperature is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] .    to study whether @xmath10-@xmath11 system has a bound state or not with the obtained potential",
    ", we solve the schrdinger equation for a spin averaged state , which is written for the radial wave function for the s - wave , @xmath12 , as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the reduced mass and @xmath15 gev is adopted .",
    "as the potential @xmath16 , we use the yukawa - type form and obtain the upper bound of the screening mass , @xmath17 , below which the bound state is formed ( the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential](right ) ) .",
    "since the values of @xmath9 measured in the lattice simulation are well larger than @xmath17 , we conclude that no bound state exists at @xmath18 from the the simple potential model analysis with the static quark potential obtained in the quenched lattice qcd .",

    "we examine a spatial @xmath10-@xmath11 correlation ( bethe - salpeter amplitude ) of the charmonium at finite temperature @xcite , @xmath19 where @xmath20 for ps and @xmath21 for v channels .",
    "@xmath22 is a smearing function for which we use the result of @xmath23 at @xmath24 at @xmath25 .",
    "figure  [ fig : wavefunc ] shows the result of @xmath10-@xmath11 correlation in the vector channel normalized at the spatial origin , @xmath26 , together with the cases of free quark and antiquark .",
    "the @xmath27-dependence @xmath28 give us a hint on the behavior of quark and antiquark in plasma phase , since if there is no bound state this spatial correlation becomes broader as @xmath27 increases , like the case of free quarks .",
    "contrary to naive expectation , even at @xmath29 we observe strong spatial correlation similar to that below @xmath1 , which is stable against @xmath27 .",
    "this implies that the quark and antiquark behave differently from the free quarks , and still tend to stay together up to this temperature",

    "the dashed lines represent the smearing function.,width=340,height=226 ]",
    "the spectral function contains the most direct information on the structure of the mesonic correlator , @xmath30 .",
    "recently the maximum entropy method ( mem ) has been successfully applied to the extraction of the spectral function from lattice data at @xmath31 without assuming specific form @xcite . however , its applicability to problems at @xmath32 is not straightforward , because available physical range of @xmath33 as well as number of data points are severely limited .",
    "we propose to use a standard @xmath3 fit analysis in combination with mem , since the former gives more quantitative result for the parameters such as mass and width than the latter if presumable form of the spectral function is given , which can be estimated with mem .",
    "the numerical simulation is performed on lattices with spatial cutoff @xmath34 gev and the anisotropy @xmath35 .    to verify the applicability of these methods at @xmath32",
    ", we require that they correctly work for the correlators at @xmath31 with restricted number of data points corresponding to the case at @xmath32 .",
    "unfortunately , mem does not pass this test for the correlators between local operators with present level of statistics ( @xmath36 configurations ) : mem fails to reproduce the correct feature of the spectral function at low energy even qualitatively for the region of @xmath33 less than @xmath37 .",
    "the reason may be that one need to extract the low energy structure from the correlator in a short distance , where the correlator contains the contribution from wide range of frequency of the spectral function .",
    "this result warns against physical significance of mem analysis of such correlators at @xmath32 .    to circumvent this problem",
    ", we apply the smearing technique which enhances the low energy part of the spectral function . for the correlators smeared with the wave function at @xmath31 ,",
    "both the procedures works well in the low energy region .",
    "although the features of the collective mode such as the mass and width are unchanged by the smearing , the smearing can produce a mimic peak structure in the spectral function @xcite . in order to examine this possibility",
    "we also observe the correlators smeared with a narrower function ( _ half - smeared _ correlators ) .",
    "the dependence of extracted spectral function on the smearing function is compared with that of correlators composed of free quarks",
    ".        at @xmath38 the result of mem still exhibits a peak structure around the same energy region as at @xmath40 .",
    "therefore we perform the same kind of the @xmath3 fit analysis as at @xmath40 .",
    "the fit to the 2-pole _ ansatz _ and to the relativistic breit - wigner ( bw ) type _ anstze _ give inconsistent results , and the latter fits indicate that the spectral function has a peak with almost the same mass as at @xmath40 and the width of order of 200 mev , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spfs ] .",
    "the result depends on the smearing function only slightly , in contrast to the free quark case , and hence we conclude that this is a physically significant structure ."
