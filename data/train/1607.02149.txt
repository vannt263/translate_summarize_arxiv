    "the finite - size ( fs ) of the nucleus results in small corrections to several low - energy electromagnetic and weak interaction processes , such as precision studies of atomic hyperfine splitting@xcite and the lamb shift@xcite , as well as nuclear beta decay@xcite . in all of these processes zemach@xcite moments enter , and the magnitudes of some of these zemach moments have been extracted @xcite from experimental measurements in very light nuclei . for heavier nuclei finite - size effects",
    "are often parameterized with a simple estimate based on the size of a hypothetical uniform - density nucleus ( viz . , @xmath1 ) , where @xmath2 is typically taken to be 1.2 fm and @xmath3 is the nucleon number .",
    "the fs correction to beta decay plays a significant role in the current reactor neutrino anomaly @xcite and so it is important to examine the approximations and uncertainties for these corrections . in the present work ,",
    "we express the fs correction to allowed beta decay in terms of zemach moments and compare nuclear structure calculations for these moments across a broad range of masses with the often used @xmath4 uniform - density approximation .",
    "we note that forbidden @xmath0-decay transitions represent @xcite about 30% of reactor antineutrino spectra and the fs corrections for these transitions are more complicated and more poorly understood than for allowed transitions .",
    "we do not discussed zemach moments for forbidden @xmath0-decays in the present work .",
    "the interaction of the out - going electron with the charge of the daughter nucleus is a large correction that has to be taken into account in nuclear @xmath0-decay studies .",
    "the primary correction involves replacing the plane wave solution for the out - going electron with a point - coulomb wave function .",
    "standard practice involves introducing the fermi function @xmath5 for a point - like nuclear charge , and then improving on this through a finite - size correction to @xmath6 . here",

    ", we focus on the fs corrections to allowed @xmath0-decay .",
    "this correction has been derived previously by other authors @xcite in various approximations , but the focus of the present work is to formulate the problem in terms of the zemach moments that play an important role in other electromagnetic and weak interaction processes .",
    "the electron density near the nuclear surface is increased by the attractive coulomb interaction , so that the @xmath0-decay rate is increased by the point - like fermi correction .",
    "the finite - size correction to the fermi function decreases the electron density near the nucleus and the rate is then decreased ( relative to the point - nucleus fermi function ) .",
    "thus , if we express the fs correction in the form @xmath10 , the sign of the finite - size correction @xmath11 is always negative . in the case of reactor fission beta - decay spectra , where the beta spectrum of each fission fragment is normalized to unity , the fs correction results in a decrease ( increase ) in the magnitude of the high - energy component of the electron ( antineutrino ) spectra .",
    "this increase in the high - energy component of the antineutrino spectrum is a major source of the reactor neutrino anomaly .",
    "the dimensionless parameters in the fs problem are @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is the fine - structure constant ) , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is any of the energy scales in the problem ( such as the electron mass , @xmath8 , or energy , @xmath7 , or the antineutrino energy , @xmath16 ) , and @xmath17 is a generic nuclear size .",
    "the quantity @xmath12 is always less than 1 , @xmath18 for typical values of @xmath19 mev and @xmath20 fm .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to first order in both @xmath12 and the nuclear size @xmath17 .",
    "the finite - size corrections to this order for allowed fermi and gamow - teller decays were previously derived by holstein@xcite .",
    "two normalized finite - size densities contribute to the correction .",
    "one is the weak transition density @xmath21 that specifies the probability of finding the beta - decaying nucleon at @xmath22 . in a simple shell model",
    "this density is the product of the initial and final radial single - particle wave functions of the decaying nucleon .",

    "( [ deltafs ] ) differs from the corresponding one in ref .",

    "most calculations of the fs correction appearing in the literature assume that the weak transition and charge densities are the same .",
    "however , the charge densities are determined by summing the distributions of all protons in the daughter nuclei , while the weak transition densities are determined by the product of the neutron and proton wave functions involved in the beta transitions .",
    "thus we need to examine the effect of including more realistic nuclear structure descriptions for these density distributions in evaluating the zemach moments appearing in eqn .",
    "( [ fsz ] ) . for this purpose",
    "we use charge and weak transition densities derived from a density - functional - theory description of the nucleus .    although the integrals in eqns .",

    "nuclear dft has the advantage of being applicable across the entire chart of the nuclides .",
    "the main ingredient in nuclear dft is the energy density functional that depends on the distributions of the nucleonic matter , spin , and kinetic densities , as well as their gradients @xcite .",

    "many of the fission fragments dominating the reactor antineutrino spectra are deformed nuclei , and might not be well described by our hartree - fock model .",
    "however , our goal for these nuclei is to gain an understanding of how fs corrections are affected by using nuclear structure models that are considerably more sophisticated than the assumption of equal uniform models for the weak transition density and the charge density .      in order to study the zemach moments we require normalized charge and weak transition densities .",
    "the normalized charge density is simply @xmath62 within the skyrme - hartree - fock model , the weak transition density simply involves one term and is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the total wave functions for the parent and daughter nuclei , respectively , and @xmath66 is the annihilation operator for the single neutron with quantum numbers @xmath67 in the parent nucleus and @xmath68 is the creation operator for the single proton with quantum numbers @xmath69 in the daughter nucleus . for allowed @xmath0-decay transitions ,",

    "orbitals with higher angular momentum tend to peak near the nuclear surface and thus dominate this region of the charge density . at smaller ( intermediate ) radii the experimental charge density is relatively flat .",
    "in contrast , the intermediate theoretical density exhibits features that can largely be attributed to orbitals with nodes , which tend to peak at these radii .",
    "this effect has been discussed in detail in refs .",

    "<S> the finite - size correction to @xmath0-decay plays an important role in determining the expected antineutrino spectra from reactors at a level that is important for the reactor - neutrino anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> here we express the leading - order finite - size correction to allowed @xmath0-decay in terms of zemach moments . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the zemach moments within a hartree - fock model using a skyrme - like energy density functional . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the zemach moments are increased relative to predictions based on the simple assumption of identical uniform nuclear - charge and weak - transition densities . </S>",
    "<S> however , for allowed ground - state to ground - state transitions in medium and heavy nuclei , the detailed nuclear structure calculations do not change the finite - size corrections significantly from the simple model predictions , and are only 10 - 15% larger than the latter even though the densities differ significantly . </S>"
