    "<S> motivated by some applications in applied mathematics , biology , chemistry , physics and engineering sciences , new tight turn type inequalities for modified bessel functions of the first and second kind are deduced . </S>",
    "<S> these inequalities provide sharp lower and upper bounds for the turnian of modified bessel functions of the first and second kind , and in most cases the relative errors of the bounds tend to zero as the argument tends to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> the chief tools in our proofs are some ideas of gronwall @xcite , an integral representation of ismail @xcite for the quotient of modified bessel functions of the second kind , results of hartman and watson @xcite and some recent results of segura @xcite . as applications of the main results some sharp turn </S>",
    "<S> type inequalities are presented for the product of modified bessel functions of the first and second kind and it is shown that this product is strictly geometrically concave . </S>"
