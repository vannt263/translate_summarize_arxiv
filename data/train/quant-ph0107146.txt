    "in recent years , greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states of three or more qubits @xcite have become ubiquitous in quantum information theory @xcite . however , the interest in ghz states began in connection with bell s theorem .",
    "while bell s proof of the impossibility of einstein , podolsky , and rosen s ( epr s ) `` elements of reality '' @xcite was based on statistical predictions and inequalities @xcite , ghz showed that a simpler proof can be achieved with perfect correlations and without inequalities @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the ghz proof was translated into experimentally verifiable bell inequalities @xcite and into real experiments @xcite .",
    "it has recently been found that not only the ghz state but any two - qubit pure entangled state admits a proof of bell s theorem without inequalities @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , over the last few years the importance of quantum entanglement as a resource for unusual kinds of communication and information processing has stimulated the mathematical study of the entanglement of multiqubit systems .",
    "in particular , there has been much interest in the classification of three - qubit pure entangled states in terms of equivalences under local operations assisted by classical communication ( locc ) @xcite .",
    "dr , vidal , and cirac @xcite have shown that there are only two classes of genuinely tripartite entanglement which are inequivalent under locc .",
    "one class is represented by the ghz state , @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 being the corresponding pauli spin matrix .",
    "the other class is represented by the @xmath0 state @xcite , @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "the ghz and @xmath0 states can not be converted into each other by means of locc .    at this point , some natural questions arise .",
    "the first being in which applications does the use of the @xmath0 state mean an improvement over previous protocols using the ghz state .",
    "this question is partially addressed in @xcite , where it is pointed out that in a three - qubit system prepared in a @xmath0 ( ghz ) state , if one of the qubits is traced out then the remaining two qubits are entangled ( completely unentangled ) .",
    "indeed , @xmath0 is the three - qubit state whose entanglement has the highest robustness against the loss of one qubit @xcite .",
    "moreover , from a single copy of the reduced density matrix for any two qubits belonging to a three - qubit @xmath0 state , one can always obtain a state which is arbitrarily close to a bell state by means of a filtering measurement @xcite .",
    "this means that , if one of the parties sharing the system prepared in a @xmath0 ( ghz ) state decides not to cooperate with the other two , or if for some reason the information about one of the qubits is lost , then the remaining two parties still can ( can not ) use entanglement resources to perform communication tasks .    on the other hand , it has been shown that the @xmath0 state does not allow a ghz - type proof of bell s theorem @xcite .",
    "therefore , two other natural questions are whether the @xmath0 state admits any kind of proof of bell s theorem without inequalities and what the differences are between the violation of local realism exhibited by the ghz and @xmath0 states . in this paper",
    ", i will describe four related results which answer these questions .",
    "first , a proof of bell s theorem without inequalities specific for the @xmath0 state .",
    "second , an extension of that proof which is also valid for the ghz state .",
    "such a proof leads to a bell - type inequality for three qubits which can be experimentally useful in order to achieve more conclusive tests of bell s theorem . finally ,",
    "a different set of bell inequalities is considered with the purpose of illustrating some differences between the violations of local realism exhibited by the ghz and @xmath0 states .",
    "first , i will show that the @xmath0 state allows three local observers to define elements of reality which are incompatible with some predictions of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "i will use the following notation : @xmath6 and @xmath7 will be the results ( @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) of measuring @xmath10 and @xmath11 on qubit @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the first step of the proof consists of showing that , in the @xmath0 state , all the @xmath6 and @xmath7 satisfy epr s criterion of elements of reality .",
    "epr s condition reads : _",
    "`` if , without in any way disturbing a system , we can predict with certainty ( i.e. , with probability equal to unity ) the value of a physical quantity , then there exists an element of physical reality corresponding to this physical quantity '' _ @xcite . from the expression of the @xmath0 state given in eq .",
    "( [ wstate ] ) , it can be immediately seen that @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are elements of reality , since the result @xmath17 can be predicted with certainty from the results of spacelike separated measurements of @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ) . in addition , by rewriting the @xmath0 state in the suitable basis , it can easily be seen that , if @xmath23 then , with certainty , @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath23 , then by measuring @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) one can predict @xmath26 ( @xmath25 ) with certainty . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath23 , then @xmath25 and @xmath26 are elements of reality . if @xmath27 then , using the expression  ( [ wstate ] ) , it can immediately be seen that @xmath28 . therefore , following the previous reasoning , @xmath29 and @xmath26 are elements of reality ( although @xmath29 could have ceased to be an element of reality after measuring @xmath10 on particle @xmath30 ) . in conclusion ,",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 are epr elements of reality and therefore , according to epr , they should have predefined values @xmath8 or @xmath9 before any measurement .",
    "however , according to quantum mechanics , such an assignment of values is impossible .",
    "the proof can be presented in a very similar way to hardy s proof of bell s theorem for nonmaximally entangled states of two qubits @xcite by using four properties of the quantum state and a logical argument based on them . for the refutation of epr s elements of reality ,",
    "the relevant properties of the @xmath0 state  ( [ wstate ] ) , which can easily be checked , are @xmath31 where @xmath32 means the probability of two qubits ( although we can not tell which one ) giving the result @xmath8 when measuring @xmath33 on all three qubits , and @xmath34 is the conditional probability of @xmath35 and @xmath36 having the same result given that the result of @xmath37 is @xmath8 .",
    "property  ( [ one ] ) tells us that , when measuring @xmath10 on all three qubits , the result @xmath8 _ always _ occurs in _ two _ of them .",
    "let us call these qubits @xmath30 and @xmath38 .",
    "then let us suppose that we had measured @xmath11 on qubits @xmath38 and @xmath39 , instead of @xmath10 . then , according to property  ( [ two ] ) , the results would have been the same .",
    "therefore , following epr , one reaches the conclusion that the predefined values corresponding to the elements of reality @xmath25 and @xmath26 are equal .",
    "now let us suppose that we had measured @xmath11 on qubits @xmath30 and @xmath39 , instead of @xmath10 . then , according to property  ( [ three ] ) , the results would have been the same .",
    "therefore , the predefined values corresponding to the elements of reality @xmath29 and @xmath26 are equal .",
    "taking these two conclusions together , one must deduce that , in the @xmath0 state , the predefined values corresponding to the elements of reality @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 _ always _ satisfy @xmath43 .",
    "however , this is in contradiction with property  ( [ four ] ) which states that , when measuring @xmath11 on all three qubits , one finds results that _ can not _ be explained with elements of reality in @xmath44 of the cases .",
    "therefore , the conclusion is that quantum predictions for the @xmath0 state can not be `` completed '' with epr s elements of reality .",
    "diagram for hardy s proof of bell s theorem without inequalities for two qubits in a nonmaximally entangled state @xcite . @xmath45 and @xmath46 are alternative spin observables of qubit @xmath30.,width=207 ]    while the structure of this proof is similar to hardy s @xcite , the logical argument is different : in hardy s , from a result that _ sometimes _ occurs , two local observers infer a result that _ never _ occurs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) ; here , from a result that _ always _ occurs , two observers infer a result that _ only sometimes _ occurs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "in addition , while in hardy s proof only 9% of the runs of a certain experiment contradict local realism , here 25% of the runs of the last experiment can not be explained by local realism . on the other hand , while in hardy s proof we need both qubits to start the argument and in ghz s proof @xcite all three qubits are required , in the proof for the @xmath0 state the contradiction results from inferences from only _ two _ of all three qubits , but we can not tell which one .",
    "diagram for the proof of bell s theorem without inequalities for the @xmath0 state.,width=207 ]",
    "for two - qubit pure states , the logical structure that can be obtained from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] by changing the `` never '' to `` fewer times '' is not particularly useful , since the states which satisfy a `` sometimes - always - never '' structure like that in fig .  [ fig2 ] , namely , nonmaximally entangled states @xcite , are the same which satisfy the extended structure @xcite .",
    "however , for three - qubit pure states , a similar extension of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] s `` always - always - sometimes '' structure ( changing the first `` always '' to `` sometimes '' and the last `` sometimes '' to `` fewer times '' ) allows us to extend the proof for the @xmath0 state to the ghz state and , therefore , to obtain a common proof of bell s theorem without inequalities for both classes of genuinely tripartite entangled states . such a proof is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and , for the ghz state  ( [ ghzstate ] ) , it is based on its following four properties which can easily be checked : @xmath47 the proof for the ghz state is parallel to the one for the @xmath0 state , changing only the `` always '' to `` in 75% of the cases '' and changing the percentage of events of the fourth experiment that can not be explained with elements of reality , which now is 50% .",
    "diagram for the extended proof of bell s theorem without inequalities valid for the ghz and @xmath0 states .",
    "the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is a particular case of this one.,width=207 ]    the previous demonstrations complete the family of simple proofs of bell s theorem without inequalities for the main classes of two- @xcite and three - qubit @xcite pure entangled states .",
    "the proofs without inequalities described in secs .  [ sec2 ] and  [ sec3 ] can easily be converted into experimentally testable bell inequalities .",
    "as noted in @xcite , the two - qubit bell inequalities proposed by clauser and horne ( ch ) @xcite can be put into a form in which only the four probabilities of a hardy - type argument are included .",
    "similarly , it can easily be seen that four probabilities related to those in eqs .",
    "( [ one])([four ] ) [ or in eqs .",
    "( [ ghzone])([ghzfour ] ) ] must satisfy the following bell inequality : @xmath48 for the @xmath0 state  ( [ wstate ] ) , the value of the first probability in eq .",
    "( [ inequalities ] ) is 1 , the values of the second and third probabilities are 0 , and the value of the fourth is 3/4 . therefore , the middle term in eq .",
    "( [ inequalities ] ) is 0.25 .",
    "this means that the violation of the inequality  ( [ inequalities ] ) is higher than the maximum violation obtained from hardy s proof , where the middle term is 0.090 @xcite , and even higher than the violation for a singlet state , where the middle term is 0.207 @xcite .",
    "the violation exhibited by the ghz state is even higher . by using properties  ( [ ghzone])([ghzfour ] )",
    ", it can easily be seen that the middle term in eq .",
    "( [ inequalities ] ) is 0.5 , which is the maximum allowed violation of a ch - type inequality and corresponds to a value four in the corresponding clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality @xcite .",
    "a similar situation occurs in mermin s inequality @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are observables of qubit @xmath30 . by choosing @xmath52 and @xmath53 , for the ghz state  ( [ ghzstate ] )",
    "we obtain four for the middle term in eq .",
    "( [ mermininequality ] ) , four being the maximum allowed violation of inequality  ( [ mermininequality ] ) .",
    "for the @xmath0 state  ( [ wstate ] ) , considering only local spin observables on plane @xmath54-@xmath55 , and that @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the maximum violation is 3.046 [ for instance , by choosing @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "alternatively , by choosing @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( which satisfy epr s criterion of elements of reality ) , the @xmath0 state  ( [ wstate ] ) gives the value three for the middle term in eq .",
    "( [ mermininequality ] ) .",
    "two reasons suggest that , for the three - qubit ghz state , inequality  ( [ inequalities ] ) could lead to a more conclusive clear - cut experimental test of bell s theorem than inequality  ( [ mermininequality ] ) . as in ch s",
    ", inequality  ( [ inequalities ] ) can be put into a form which does not involve the number of undetected particles , thereby rendering unnecessary the assumption of fair sampling @xcite . on the other hand , since ch and chsh inequalities are equivalent @xcite , and eq .",
    "( [ inequalities ] ) and ch [ eq .",
    "( [ mermininequality ] ) and chsh ] inequalities have the same bounds , the ratio between the maximum violations shown by the ghz and singlet states for inequality  ( [ inequalities ] ) over ch s [ eq .  ( [ mermininequality ] ) over chsh s ] , @xmath60 [ @xmath61 , suggests that eq .",
    "( [ inequalities ] ) reveals a higher violation of local realism than eq .",
    "( [ mermininequality ] ) .",
    "as a final remark , the results in @xcite point out that bipartite correlations are relevant to the @xmath0 state but not to the ghz state . therefore , it would be interesting to consider bell inequalities involving both tripartite and bipartite correlations",
    ". the simplest way of obtaining such an inequality would be by adding genuinely bipartite correlations to the tripartite correlations considered in mermin s inequality .",
    "for instance , a straightforward calculation would allow us to prove that any local realistic theory must satisfy the following inequality : @xmath62 assuming that @xmath50 and @xmath51 are local observables on plane @xmath54-@xmath55 , and that @xmath56 and @xmath57 , a numerical calculation shows that both the ghz and @xmath0 states give a maximum value four for the middle term in eq .",
    "( [ bell3plus2 ] ) ( for instance , by choosing @xmath52 and @xmath53 in both cases ) .",
    "therefore , both states lead to the _ same _ maximal violation of the inequality  ( [ bell3plus2 ] ) .",
    "however , if we assign a higher weight to the bipartite correlations appearing in the inequality , then we can reach a bell inequality such as @xmath63 which is violated by the @xmath0 state [ for instance , by choosing @xmath52 and @xmath64 , state  ( [ wstate ] ) gives the value five for the middle term in eq .",
    "( [ bell2plus3 ] ) ] but _ not _ by the ghz state",
    ". therefore , there are scenarios involving both tripartite and bipartite correlations in which the quantum predictions for the ghz state can be reproduced with a local model while those for the @xmath0 state can not . a more general study of multipartite bell inequalities is presented in @xcite .",
    "in brief , we have completed the family of proofs without inequalities for two- and three - qubit pure entangled states with a proof for the @xmath0 state that can also be extended to the ghz state and we have then obtained two bell inequalities for three qubits . the first could lead to more conclusive tests of bell s theorem .",
    "the second , involving both tri- and bipartite correlations , illustrates some differences between the violations of local realism exhibited by the ghz and @xmath0 states .",
