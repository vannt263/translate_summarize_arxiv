    "the large data sample collected by the  detector provides an excellent opportunity for a significant improvement to the existing measurements of the average @xmath0 multiplicity in @xmath9 meson decay at the resonance .",
    "this quantity , which is conventionally denoted @xmath10 , was previously measured by cleo as ( 2.30.60.5)% @xcite and by argus as ( 3.900.300.35)% @xcite .",
    "these two measurements disagree at the @xmath11 level , leading to a large error on the particle data group average ( @xmath12)% @xcite .",
    "the opal collaboration has measured the average multiplicity @xmath13 @xcite at the @xmath14 pole .",
    "this latter measurement is sensitive to @xmath15-hadron decays that are not accessible at experiments , including @xmath15 baryons and , in particular , the @xmath16 meson .",
    "an improved measurement of @xmath17 can lead to improved measurements of the @xmath16 oscillation frequency .",
    "the primary decay modes of the @xmath16 meson contain @xmath18 mesons , which often ( 18% @xcite ) produce a @xmath0 meson in their decays . due to this high rate",
    ", @xmath16 decays into @xmath0 mesons are a prime decay chain for @xmath16 oscillation searches .",
    "an important input to such searches is the knowledge of the background arising from non - strange @xmath9 meson decays into @xmath0 mesons .",
    "given the large size of the  data sample , this measurement is limited by systematic errors . as a result , this analysis is designed to minimize these systematic errors .",
    "minimal selection criteria are applied , and efficiencies and backgrounds are evaluated directly from data where possible .",
    "the measurement is performed in @xmath0-momentum intervals to minimize the systematic effects that may be introduced by differences between the @xmath0 momentum spectrum in data and simulation .",
    "the data used in this analysis were collected by the  detector at the 2 storage ring .",
    "we use @xmath4 of data taken at the resonance ( on - resonance ) and @xmath19 of data taken at a center - of - mass energy @xmath20 below the threshold ( off - resonance ) .",
    "the latter sample is used for the subtraction of the non - component ( continuum ) in the on - resonance data .",
    "these data samples were taken between january and may 2002 .",
    "additional data , consisting of 3.5  @xmath21 of on - resonance data and 1 @xmath21 of off - resonance data taken under different running conditions , are used for verification of the result .",
    "a detailed description of the  detector is presented in ref .",
    "the components of the detector most relevant to this analysis are described here .",
    "charged - particle tracks are reconstructed with a five - layer , double - sided silicon vertex tracker ( svt ) and a 40-layer drift chamber ( dch ) with a helium - based gas mixture , placed in a 1.5-t solenoidal field produced by a superconducting magnet .",
    "the resolution on @xmath22 , the charged - track momentum transverse to the beam direction , is approximately @xmath23 .",
    "charged particles are identified from the ionization energy loss ( @xmath24 ) measured in the dch and svt , and the cherenkov radiation detected in a ring - imaging cherenkov device .",
    "the efficiency for identifying true kaons exceeds 80% over most of the momentum range of interest , while the probability for a pion to be misidentified as a kaon is less than 3% .",
    "we use monte carlo samples of @xmath25 and @xmath26 decays , corresponding to twice the expected number of @xmath9 mesons in the data sample , to study our selection efficiency .",
    "the @xmath9-meson decays are simulated according to previously measured branching fractions which account for approximately 60% of all @xmath9 decays .",
    "the remaining 40% are modeled by jetset @xcite , while preventing any enhancement of the first 60% .",
    "the detector response in these samples is simulated with the geant4 program @xcite and cross - checked with control samples in the data .",
    "events are selected if at least three tracks are found and the measured total energy is at least 4.5 @xmath27 . in order to suppress continuum background ,",
    "events are rejected if the ratio of the second - to - zeroth order fox wolfram moments @xcite ( @xmath28 ) is higher than 0.25 .",
    "this requirement rejects 62% of the off - resonance data , while retaining 78% of the simulated @xmath29 events .",
    "the selection of @xmath30 candidates requires two oppositely - charged tracks that satisfy @xmath31 , have at least 12 hits in the dch , are consistent with originating from the primary interaction point , and satisfy kaon identification criteria based on @xmath24 measurements and cherenkov radiation .",
    "tracks are assigned a kaon mass hypothesis and neutral two - track combinations are formed .",
    "candidates are selected if their invariant mass is in the range @xmath32 .",
    "this mass window is equivalent to about 4.5 standard deviations on either side of the nominal @xmath0 mass , where the rms spread in the @xmath33 distribution is due to both the natural @xmath0 width and the detector resolution .",
    "this relatively large acceptance is chosen to reduce the effect of a possible mass resolution difference between data and monte carlo , at the expense of signal - to - background significance .    a total of @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) @xmath0 candidates survive these selection criteria in the on- ( off-)resonance sample .",
    "two sources of background to the @xmath29 signal are considered : random combinations of tracks that pass the selection ( combinatorial background ) and true @xmath0 mesons that do not originate from events ( continuum background ) . because the reconstruction efficiency depends on the momentum of the @xmath0 ,",
    "these backgrounds are subtracted separately in 16 bins of @xmath0 momentum .",
    "we first remove the continuum background from our signal by subtracting the @xmath33 distribution obtained in the off - resonance sample from that in the on - resonance sample , scaled by the ratio of the luminosities of the two samples .",
    "this scale factor is calculated by comparing the number of @xmath36 events in the two samples .",
    "the center - of - mass momenta of @xmath0 candidates in the off - resonance data are scaled by the ratio of on / off - resonance beam energies to account for the slightly different momentum spectrum of the continuum component in the on - resonance sample .",
    "this procedure explicitly accounts for all backgrounds from physics processes other than production as their cross sections are almost identical at the two energies ; it also accounts for beam - related backgrounds , as the running conditions were very similar .",
    "we next subtract the combinatorial background to extract the number of @xmath0 mesons .",
    "this background is estimated by fitting the mass distribution in sideband regions well away from both the signal and the @xmath37 threshold .",
    "the ranges @xmath38 and @xmath39 were chosen and the function @xmath40 was used .",
    "this function provides a good description of the phase space in the vicinity of a threshold ; a fit to the combinatoric @xmath33 spectrum ( removing true @xmath0 mesons ) in monte carlo gives @xmath41 for 95 degrees of freedom .",
    "figure  [ onoff ] shows the @xmath33 distributions of the on - resonance and luminosity - scaled off - resonance data samples for all @xmath0 momentum bins combined ; the fitted combinatorial background shapes are overlaid .",
    "the on- ( off- ) resonance fit has @xmath42 for 61 degrees of freedom . with estimates of the combinatorial background shape ,",
    "the signal is extracted by subtracting the background .",
    "the resulting signals are shown in the lower part of figure  [ onoff ] . in the on - resonance sample , we observe @xmath43 candidates , and the corresponding number in the off - resonance sample is @xmath44 .",
    "these plots and numbers are representative only ; they are not used in the signal extraction .",
    "erroneous estimation of the signal in data and simulation could arise from a number of sources .",
    "the phase - space function may be unable to describe the background shape correctly ( see monte carlo fit above )",
    ". there may be @xmath0 mesons with a reconstructed mass in the sideband regions , which would affect the background estimation and therefore the signal yield .",
    "the monte carlo may not correctly model the signal lineshape ( in particular , the fraction of @xmath0 mesons outside the signal mass region ) , leading to a systematic uncertainty on the efficiency .",
    "we consider each of these sources below .",
    "we vary the fitting procedure in a number of ways in order to test the robustness of our background estimation .",
    "we replace the third order polynomial in the above function with both a second order polynomial in @xmath33 and an exponential term @xmath45 .",
    "these changes result in a 0.15% and 0.65% change in the number of @xmath0 candidates respectively .    to account for the possibility that the reconstructed @xmath0 mass extends into the sideband regions , we vary the upper bound of the region excluded from the fit , raising it from 1.04 to 1.06 @xmath46 ( while keeping the signal region as defined above ) . the largest difference in",
    "the number of @xmath0 mesons in the signal region in the above variations is 2.4% .    finally , we look at the fraction of candidates , after background subtraction , outside the signal mass region .",
    "we count the number of candidates in the range @xmath47 and calculate the ratio of this number to the number of candidates in the signal region .",
    "this ratio is found to be 2.4% in data and 2.6% in monte carlo .",
    "this yields a difference of 0.2% on the number of @xmath0 candidates between data and monte carlo .",
    "we take the largest difference in all the above tests ( 2.4% ) to be the systematic uncertainty associated with the combinatorial background subtraction and signal selection .",
    "the kaon identification efficiency is extracted from data to avoid the systematic errors associated with monte carlo - based determinations . to do this ,",
    "@xmath0 candidates are constructed from two - track combinations with at least one track passing the kaon identification criteria .",
    "this is done for positive and negative tracks separately to account for a possible asymmetry .",
    "three subsamples of the data are defined : @xmath7 , where both tracks have passed the kaon identification requirements , and @xmath48 , where only one track is required to pass the kaon selection . the same off - resonance subtraction and @xmath28 requirement is made in defining these samples as for the standard selection .",
    "the kaon identification efficiency is then given by the ratio of the number of @xmath0 mesons reconstructed in the @xmath7 sample to the number in the @xmath48 samples : @xmath49 .",
    "figure [ fig : pid ] shows the invariant mass distribution of the @xmath7 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 samples over the entire momentum region .",
    "studies of data and monte carlo samples show that the kaon identification efficiency is not constant throughout the momentum range of our @xmath0 sample , but can be described by one constant efficiency values below @xmath52 and another above this value .",
    "this step in efficiency is caused by the transition from @xmath24-based particle identification at low momenta to cherenkov - angle - based particle identification at higher momenta .",
    "since our analysis was performed in @xmath0 momentum bins , such behavior may introduce a bias in the result if the kaon selection efficiency is taken as a constant value over the entire range .",
    "we therefore extract the kaon selection efficiency separately above and below this momentum .",
    "we measure @xmath53 and @xmath54 for @xmath55 , and @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    ", @xmath50 and @xmath51 samples .",
    "all selection criteria were applied in the @xmath7 sample but one track is not required to pass the kaon selection in the @xmath48 samples.,width=336 ]    the remaining efficiency to be estimated is @xmath59 , that of finding two charged tracks that originate from a @xmath0 meson , satisfy the @xmath28 requirement , and have an invariant mass in the signal region ( with no kaon identification requirement ) .",
    "this efficiency is estimated from monte carlo .",
    "since the efficiency to reconstruct a @xmath0 depends on the @xmath0 momentum , differences between the momentum spectrum in data and the generated spectrum in the monte carlo sample must be considered .",
    "therefore , the analysis was carried out separately in 16 bins of @xmath0 momentum .",
    "the bins are chosen to have equal ( with the exception of the lowest momentum range ) numbers of reconstructed @xmath0 mesons in the monte carlo .",
    "figure [ fig : eff ] shows the efficiency @xmath59 as a function of the @xmath0 momentum .     as a function of @xmath0 momentum .",
    "the highest bin includes all entries above 1.9 @xmath60 .",
    "errors shown are statistical only.,width=336 ]",
    "the average multiplicity is calculated with the formula @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the number of @xmath0 mesons in momentum bin @xmath63 found in the data and assumed to come from @xmath9 mesons .",
    "this number is obtained by performing the background fit to the on - resonance data samples after subtracting the off - resonance data samples , scaled to the on - resonance luminosity .",
    "the efficiency @xmath64 is the product of the reconstruction efficiency and the kaon identification efficiencies for each track .",
    "the quantity @xmath65 is the number of events in the data sample , which is measured to be @xmath66 using a technique described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "since the analysis was performed in @xmath0 momentum bins , the efficiency in each bin has very little dependence on the modeling of the @xmath0 spectrum , except for the lowest - momentum bin , which includes the tracking detection limit .",
    "we therefore sum the yield in the highest 15 bins and extrapolate the result based on the simulated spectrum , so that the sum in equation  [ multeq ] is replaced by    @xmath67    here , @xmath68 is the number of @xmath0 mesons in the monte carlo sample in momentum bin @xmath63 .    using @xmath69 @xcite , we obtain @xmath70 , where the error is statistical only .",
    "figure [ fig : spectrum ] shows the measured and simulated @xmath0 momentum spectra in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "we note that the monte carlo sample predicts the observed @xmath0 momentum spectrum reasonably well .",
    "momentum spectra of the measured and monte carlo generated samples .",
    "the measured spectrum shows statistical and systematic errors combined , and the generated spectrum is normalized to the measured multiplicity .",
    "the lowest momentum bin has a negative central value due to the large continuum component but is consistent with positive values due to the large error.,width=336 ]",
    "systematic uncertainties are associated with all of the variables in equation  1 .",
    "table  [ syst ] lists the various systematic uncertainties , which are described in detail below .",
    ".relative systematic uncertainties . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     two sources contribute to the uncertainty on @xmath71 , the number of @xmath0 mesons from events .",
    "one is the fitting procedure error which is described in section [ section : bg ] and was taken to be 2.4% .",
    "the other is the error on the scaling factor ( on / off - resonance ) which contributes 0.1% relative uncertainty on the measured average multiplicity .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath72 introduces a relative error of 1.2% , while that on @xmath65 contributes 1.1% relative uncertainty on the average multiplicity .",
    "as @xmath59 is obtained from monte carlo , differences between data and monte carlo give rise to systematic uncertainties .",
    "several components contribute to this systematic uncertainty :    * there is a systematic uncertainty related to the extrapolation of the 15-bin yield to the full result , due to our limited knowledge of the @xmath0 spectrum in @xmath9 decays . since only about 60% of @xmath9",
    "meson decays are well understood ( see section  [ detector ] ) , mismodeling of the remaining 40% can affect the result . to account for this model dependence ,",
    "we study two monte carlo subsamples representing extreme cases to make up the entire remaining 40% .",
    "the first subsample contains a @xmath9 meson undergoing a two - body decay to a charm meson , with the charm meson undergoing a two - body decay to a @xmath0 . in the second subsample ,",
    "the @xmath9 meson undergoes a multi - body ( greater than two ) decay and the subsequent charm meson undergoes a multi - body decay into a final state that contains a @xmath0 meson .",
    "these two cases yield very different kinematic distributions for the @xmath0 meson .",
    "we measure the fraction of candidates in the lowest bin in each sample .",
    "we take the largest difference between these samples and the primary result as a systematic uncertainty .",
    "it is found to be 0.7% .",
    "the effect of @xmath0 polarization was similarly studied and found to have a negligible impact on the result . * to establish the contribution to the systematic uncertainty from the simulation of @xmath28 ,",
    "the number of @xmath0 mesons from @xmath73 events is estimated again without the @xmath28 requirement , and the same procedure is applied to the monte carlo .",
    "the fraction of @xmath0 mesons from @xmath9 decays with @xmath74 in data is ( 78.180.80)% while this fraction in monte carlo is ( 78.000.09)% , in agreement within statistical errors .",
    "we also investigate the two decay models mentioned above for their effect on the @xmath28 selection .",
    "we find that the largest difference between the models and our monte carlo distribution is 0.5% , and we take this difference as a systematic uncertainty .",
    "+ an additional test is performed by examining different continuum - suppression variables .",
    "we study the angle between the @xmath0 direction in the center - of - mass frame and thrust axis of the event , where the thrust was calculated both including and excluding the @xmath0 candidate .",
    "these two variables are each used in place of @xmath28 in order to suppress continuum events .",
    "we place appropriate criteria on these variables to maintain similar efficiency to that of @xmath28 in our analysis .",
    "we then measure the efficiency of these requirements in data and monte carlo .",
    "the ratio of efficiencies between data and monte carlo is found to be @xmath75 for the first variable",
    "( with the @xmath0 ) and @xmath76 for the other .",
    "* tracking performance is studied using control samples in data , and the track - finding efficiency is found to be accurate to within 0.8% per track .",
    "we therefore assign a 1.6% systematic uncertainty due to tracking efficiency . *",
    "finally , the statistical uncertainty on @xmath59 contributes a 0.3% systematic uncertainty .",
    "the use of one single kaon selection efficiency for all @xmath0 momenta was compared to the use of separate values above and below @xmath77 .",
    "the observed difference in the average multiplicity was 0.9% .",
    "this is below the statistical error on the kaon identification efficiencies , hence no additional error was assigned to this source .",
    "the statistical error on the kaon selection efficiencies is treated as part of the statistical error in this analysis as it is obtained from the same data set as our signal and scales appropriately .",
    "the above sources of systematic uncertainty are added in quadrature and yield a relative uncertainty on the average multiplicity of 3.4% .",
    "this analysis is repeated by replacing the 16 @xmath78 bins with 6 bins of @xmath79 , the polar angle of the @xmath0 candidate with respect to the beam axis . as the total number of events is exactly the same as in the analysis described above",
    ", this is not an independent measurement , and can only serve to validate the fitting procedure .",
    "the combinatorial background in these bins is significantly different in shape to that used in the primary analysis .",
    "the total yield of @xmath0 mesons from @xmath9 decays is found to differ by 0.88% from the yield in the primary analysis  well within the assigned uncertainty for this source .",
    "we also repeat the analysis using a different data set .",
    "we use a smaller data set from the year 2000 in which the detector was operating under different conditions .",
    "this analysis yields @xmath80 where the error is statistical only , entirely consistent with our primary result .",
    "by selecting two identified oppositely - charged kaons from a sample of data and subtracting the combinatorial and continuum background , we measure the average multiplicity of @xmath0 mesons in @xmath9 meson decays .",
    "our measurement of @xmath81 is consistent with both previous measurements at the @xmath82 level , although it is significantly more precise",
    ".    we are grateful for the extraordinary contributions of our 2  colleagues in achieving the excellent luminosity and machine conditions that have made this work possible .",
