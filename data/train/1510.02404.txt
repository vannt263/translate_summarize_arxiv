    "contemporary * observational knowledge on the baryon density of the universe * is based mainly on the following sets of precise observational data : data based on big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , i.e. the determination of the baryon density from the requirement of consistency between theoretically predicted and observationally measured abundances of the primordially produced light elements @xcite ; measurements of deuterium towards low metallicity distant quasars compared with bbn predicted d @xcite ; cmb anisotropy measurements ( see wmap @xcite and planck @xcite ) , allowing precise determination of the main universe characteristics , including the baryon density .",
    "namely , the consistency between theoretically obtained and observationally measured abundances of the light elements produced in bbn @xcite requires that the baryon - to - photon density is in the range :    @xmath10    the information from measurements of deuterium towards low metallicity quasars combined with bbn data @xcite points to :    @xmath11    the most precise determination is provided by the measurements of the cmb anisotropy ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "recent results by wmap9 @xcite point to :    @xmath13    the up - to - date data from planck project @xcite point to :    @xmath14    * observational constraints exist on the presence of the antimatter * in our local vicinity ( within tens of mpc ) , mainly based on cosmic ray data  @xcite and gamma ray data  @xcite .",
    "no antimatter in astronomically considerable amounts has been observed / detected .",
    "hence , the baryon asymmetry inn our neighborhood is @xmath15 .",
    "observational evidence for matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe has been recently reviewed in refs.@xcite .    in case",
    "this locally observed asymmetry is a _ global _ characteristic of the universe , i.e. baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) , it may be due to the generation of a baryon excess at some early stage of the universe that , eventually diluted during its further evolution , determined the value observed today .",
    "a. sakharov  @xcite defined the conditions for the generation of predominance of matter over antimatter from initially symmetric state of the early universe .",

    "@xcite . in  @xcite",
    "different mechanisms for generation both of the baryon asymmetry and the dark matter of the universe and their dependence on the reheating temperature have been discussed .",

    "* gut baryogenesis * is the earliest baryogenesis scenario , proceeding at gut unification scale @xmath16 .",
    "however , most inflationary models predict reheating temperature below this scale .",

    "however , the simplest and most appealing version of this scenario can not generate within the standard model the observed value of the baryon asymmetry , because of the insufficient cp - violation  @xcite induced by ckm phase and the requirement of first order electro - weak transition , possible only for higgs boson mass considerably smaller than the detected one by atlas and cms collaborations .",
    "ew baryogenesis in minimal supersymmetric standard model was considered  @xcite .",

    "* ad baryogenesis * scenario  @xcite is one of the most promising today baryogenesis scenarios , compatible with inflation .",
    "nice reviews of ad baryogenesis contemporary status can be found in refs .",
    "ad baryogenesis has numerous attractive features .",
    "a short list of these is as follows : ( i ) it is extremely efficient - it can produce equal or much bigger than the observed baryon asymmetry ; ( ii ) it can be realized at lower energy , i.e. relatively late in the universe evolution .",
    "i.e. it is consistent with the low energy scales after inflation ; ( iii ) ad condensate can be generated generically in different cosmological models ; ( iv ) it can explain simultaneously the generation of the baryon and the dark matter in the universe , and explain their surprisingly close values ; ( v ) ad model , due to its high efficiency , can be successful even in case of significant production of entropy at late times , predicted by some particle physics models .",
    "ad scenario is based on susy . in supersymmetric models",
    "scalar superpartner of baryons and leptons @xmath17 exist .",
    "the potential u(@xmath17 ) of such scalar field may have flat directions , along which the field can have a non - zero vacuum expectation value due to quantum fluctuations during inflation .",
    "after inflation @xmath17 evolves down to the equilibrium point @xmath17 = 0 and if the potential u(@xmath17 ) is not symmetric with respect to the phase rotation it acquires non - vanishing and typically large baryon charge .",
    "subsequent b - conserving decay of @xmath17 into quarks and leptons transform baryon asymmetry into the quarks sector .",
    "in contrast to other scenarios of baryogenesis , in which the generated asymmetry usually is insufficient , the original afleck - dine scenario leads to higher value of @xmath5 and additional mechanisms are needed to dilute it down to the observed value .",
    "ad mechanism was re - examined in refs .",
    "it was realized that finite energy density of the early universe breaks susy and induces soft parameters in the soft potential along flat directions , which are of the order of the hubble parameter .",
    "then , contrary to the original ad mechanism the observed value of the baryon asymmetry may be generated , without the requirement of subsequent entropy release .",
    "different issues on ad baryogenesis were presented in refs .",
    "ad baryogenesis mechanism was used in numerous sm extensions and different inflationary scenario . just to list several of the more recent studies : ad in effective supergravity  @xcite , ad in anomaly mediated susy breaking models  @xcite , ad in susy with r - parity violation  @xcite , ad in d - term inflation  @xcite , etc .",
    "most of ad baryogenesis models can naturally explain the origin of the dark matter in the universe .",

    "we discuss the scalar field condensate baryogenesis model ( sfc baryogenesis ) , which is among the preferred today baryogenesis scenarios , compatible with inflation .",
    "it is based on the affleck - dine scenario .",
    "sfc baryogenesis model was first discussed and studied analytically in refs.@xcite .",
    "there it was shown that the account of particle creation by the time varying scalar field during post - inflationary period will lead to strong reduction of the produced baryon excess in the affleck - dine scenario .",
    "namely , it was proven that fast oscillations of @xmath17 result in particle creation due to the coupling of the scalar field to fermions @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "for @xmath20 the rate of particle creation @xmath21 exceeds the ordinary decay rate of @xmath17 at the stage of baryon non - conservation and , therefore , its amplitude is damped .",
    "hence , the baryon charge , contained in the condensate , is reduced due to particle creation at this stage with considerable baryon violation .",
    "the baryon charge , contained in the condensate , is reduced exponentially and it does not survive till @xmath17 decays to quarks and leptons . in case when @xmath21 is a decreasing function of time the damping process may be slow enough for the baryon charge contained in @xmath17 to survive until the b - conservation epoch . ]",
    "the importance of a precise numerical account for the particle creation processes was explored further in refs.@xcite .",
    "different possibilities of sfc baryogenesis models were discussed . the possibility to generate simultaneously , within inhomogeneous scf baryogenesis model , the observed baryon asymmetry and the observed large scale structure quasi - periodicity of the baryonic matter was studied in refs.@xcite .",
    "on the basis of inhomogeneous scf baryogenesis elegant mechanisms were proposed for achieving sufficient separation between domains of matter and antimatter ( to inhibit the contact and evade annihilation of matter and antimatter regions with big density ) , that allow the production of considerable antimatter domains with different size in the universe and their observational signatures were analyzed  @xcite .    in series of papers @xcite , we explored numerically sfc baryogenesis model . here",
    "we present the results of our extended numerical analysis of the evolution of the baryon excess in sfc baryogenesis model and its dependence on the model parameters .    in the next section",
    "we briefly describe the scf baryogenesis model and the numerical approach we have used .",
    "the last section presents the results , i.e. we present the value of the produced baryon density for numerous sets of model s parameters .",
    "the essential ingredient of the model is a baryon charged complex scalar field @xmath17 , present together with the inflaton . a condensate @xmath22 with a nonzero baryon charge is formed during the inflationary period as a result of the rise of quantum fluctuations of the @xmath17 field @xcite : @xmath23 untill the limiting value @xmath24 in case that @xmath25 terms dominate in the potential energy of @xmath17 .",
    "the baryon charge of the field is not conserved at large field amplitude due to the presence of the @xmath26 nonconserving self - interaction terms in its potential .",

    "the initial values for the field variables are derived from the natural assumption that the energy density of @xmath17 at the inflationary stage is of the order @xmath35 , then    @xmath36    after inflation @xmath17 oscillates around its equilibrium point and its amplitude decreases due to the universe expansion and the particle creation by the oscillating scalar field . in case @xmath21",

    "the results of the extended analysis showed that the final value of @xmath26 may be much sensitive to @xmath81 and @xmath82 than previously estimated .",
    "namely , we have found that the final values of @xmath26 may differ up to 3 orders of magnitude even for small changes of these parameters .",
    "for example for @xmath90 gev , @xmath91 , @xmath74 , @xmath84 the final b value for @xmath92 is @xmath93 , while for @xmath71 is @xmath94 .",
    "thus , we have found that the dependence of baryon generation on the self - coupling constants is important for determination of the parameters range for the successful baryogenesis model .",
    "in order to estimate the baryon asymmetry on the basis of the obtained results for the produced baryon density it is necessary to know the temperature of the relativistic plasma after the decay of @xmath17 and the decay of the inflaton .    in case",
    "the inflaton energy density dominates until the decay of @xmath17 , i.e. prior to reheating , @xmath31 , the entropy is mainly defined by the relativistic particles from inflaton decay .",
    "thus , the temperature after the decay of @xmath30 at @xmath95 will be approximately @xmath96    then the baryon asymmetry will be given by :    @xmath97    where @xmath98 is the reheating temperature after the decay of the inflaton .",

    "also , the later the inflaton decays the smaller the produced @xmath5 will be . knowing that the reheating temperature should be sufficiently low to avoid gravitino problem ,",
    "i.e. in our model it should be several orders or more lower than the value of @xmath1 , and having the results for @xmath26 , it is easy to obtain the value of the observed baryon asymmetry for different sets of parameters in this model .",
    "of course the @xmath1 , the decay time of @xmath30 and the value of the reheating temperature may be different in different inflationary scenarios .",
    "we would like only to note here that the results of the numerical analysis of the scf baryogenesis model are encouraging .",

    "we have investigated the dependence of the evolution of the field and the evolution of the baryon charge contained in it , as well as the final value of the baryon charge contained in it on the model s parameters : the gauge coupling constant @xmath0 , the hubble parameter at the inflationary stage @xmath1 , the mass m and the self - coupling constants @xmath3 .",
