    "some physical systems can be described by using multibrackets instead of poisson brackets ; for example : the euler equations of the free rigid body , the maxwell - bloch equations of laser - matter dynamics , the toda lattice equation and the heavy top .",
    "beginning with nambu @xcite and following with takhtajan @xcite these multibrackets , usually called _ nambu - poisson structures_(np structures , on short ) led to some interesting mathematical developments @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , one of the main subjects of dynamics , namely _ the first integrals _ , was not intensively studied except @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to make an attempt of studying this subject .",
    "more precisely , two types of first integrals of hamiltonian np vector fields are obtained by using the notions of pseudosymmetry and adjoint pseudosymmetry . also , the fact that the bracket of @xmath1-first integrals is again a first integral is generalized .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : the first section covers the main result of the author s paper @xcite , the second section gives the basics of np theory and the third section presents applications to homogeneous hamiltonian vector fields on @xmath2 .",
    "the next section contains the adjoint pseudosymmetries approach to find first integrals in np dynamics .",
    "two appendices are inserted at the end of paper .",
    "since evolution in np mechanics is given by a vector field , called _ hamiltonian vector field _ like in symplectic mechanics , we will be interested in methods to find first integrals for vector fields .",
    "in @xcite we obtained such a method by using pseudosymmetries and this section recall the results of the cited paper .",
    "let @xmath3 be a smooth , @xmath4-dimensional manifold , @xmath5 the ring of real - valued smooth functions , @xmath6 the lie algebra of vector fields and @xmath7 the @xmath8-module of @xmath9-differential forms , @xmath10 .",
    "for @xmath11 with local expression @xmath12 one considers the system of differential equations which gives the flow of @xmath13 : @xmath14 a solution of @xmath15 is called an _ integral curve _ of @xmath13 .    a function @xmath16 is called a _ conservation law _ ( or _ first integral , _ or _ constant of motion , _ or _ invariant function _ ) _  _ of @xmath13 or of @xmath17 if @xmath18 is constant along the solutions of @xmath17 that is @xmath19 for every integral curve @xmath20 of @xmath13 .",

    "in this section we review the necessary facts from np structures . for more details see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references therein .    a _ nambu - poisson bracket or structure _ of order @xmath1 , @xmath49 is an internal @xmath1-ary operation on @xmath50 , denoted by @xmath51 , which satisfies the following axioms : + ( i ) @xmath51 is @xmath52-multilinear and skew - symmetric + ( ii ) the _ leibniz rule : _",

    "if such a field defines a np bracket , it is called a _ np tensor ( field)_. @xmath57 defines a bundle mapping @xmath58 given by : @xmath59 where all the arguments are covectors .",
    "the next basic notion is that of the @xmath57-_hamiltonian vector field _ of @xmath60 functions defined by : @xmath61    related to our subject of interest , namely first integrals , there are three important properties :    a function @xmath62 is a first integral of @xmath63 if and only if @xmath64    the np bracket of @xmath1 first integrals is again a first integral .",
    "the hamiltonian vector fields are infinitesimal automorphisms of the np tensor : @xmath65",
    "let us suppose that @xmath67(this imply @xmath68 ! ) and introduce the following differential forms :    \\(i ) @xmath69 , the volume @xmath1-form ,    \\(ii ) @xmath70 , the @xmath71-form associated to @xmath63 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the lemma 1 from @xcite gives that @xmath72 is an invariant @xmath1-form of @xmath63 or in other words @xmath63 is a _",
    "solenoidal _ vector field .",
    "also , from @xmath73 it results that @xmath74 is an invariant @xmath71-form of @xmath63 .",
    "therefore in the np setting on @xmath67 there are two invariant forms for a hamiltonian vector field",
    ". then we have the following form of proposition 2.4 :    _ if _ @xmath26 _ is a symmetry of _ @xmath75 _ and _ @xmath76 _ are _",

    "in this case applying the previous result with @xmath84 and @xmath85 we get :    _ let @xmath63 be a @xmath9-homogeneous hamiltonian vector field on @xmath67 .",
    "if @xmath86 are @xmath87 @xmath63-pseudosymmetries of @xmath63 then : @xmath88 is a first integral of _ @xmath63_. in particular , if _",
    "@xmath89 _ then _",
    "@xmath90 _ is a first integral of _ @xmath91_. _    * example 2.6 revisited . *",
    "the system @xmath48 can be written in np form with(@xcite ) : @xmath92 and : @xmath93    so , because this system is np and homogeneous , the previous proposition works . for a list of others homogeneous hamiltonian vector fields",
    "see appendix 1 .",
    "we return to the case @xmath55 of proposition 4.1 for local expressions .",
    "so , let @xmath94 be a poisson bracket on @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "then : @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99 and the @xmath9-homogeneity of @xmath100 reads as follows : @xmath101    therefore we get :    _ let _",

    "@xmath100_. _    at the beginning of this section",
    "we use the p. morando s result that every np hamiltonian vector field on @xmath2 is solenoidal . in the following",
    "we give a local converse of this topic .",
    "so , if @xmath105 is solenoidal , a generalized euler theorem states that there are @xmath106 smooth functions in a neighbourhood @xmath107 of every regular point @xmath9 of @xmath13(that is @xmath108 ) such that : @xmath109 where @xmath110 means the gradient of @xmath111 and @xmath112 is the vector product of @xmath2 . but @xmath113 is exactly the expression nambu - poisson of @xmath13 .",
    "in order to obtain a result similar to proposition 2.4 in np mechanics we need :    let @xmath11 and @xmath114 .",
    "then a given @xmath115 is called an @xmath32-_adjoint _ _ pseudosymmetry _ of @xmath13 if @xmath116 for some @xmath117 .",
