    "more than thirty years ago , visvanathan & griersmith ( 1977 ) found that early - type spiral galaxies ( s0/a to sab ) exhibit optical color - magnitude relation ( cmr ) , that is , luminous spirals show redder colors than less - luminous systems .",
    "later , many studies confirmed this phenomena and extended the cmrs of spirals from optical to infrared bands ( tully et al .",

    "chang et al . ( 2006a ) collected a sample of late - type galaxies from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) and found that , after correcting the effect of dust attenuation , the optical - infrared ( optical - ir ) colors present tighter correlations with the absolute magnitude than optical colors .",
    "based on a matched sample of galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) and sdss , wyder et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and schiminovich et al ( 2007 ) explored the ultraviolet - optical ( uv - optical ) cmrs for both disk and bulge - dominated galaxies .",
    "they also found that disk - dominated galaxies show a tight correlation between specific star formation rate ( @xmath4 ) and galactic stellar mass ( @xmath1 ) , which is denoted as the mass - sfr relation for convenience .    on the other hand , interpretation of these observed cmrs of disk galaxies",
    "is still an open question .",
    "van den bosch ( 2002 ) and bell et al . ( 2003 ) found that , contrary to the observed trends , their semi - analytic models ( sams ) predicted that faint spirals should be slightly redder than bright spirals . by introducing additional mechanics like active galactic nucleus ( agn ) feedback",
    ", the more recent sams can predict positive slopes of the cmrs of spirals , i.e. , lower mass systems being bluer than massive systems ( e.g. kang et al .",
    "2005 , croton et al .",
    "2006 ) . however , the slopes of the predicted cmrs are still shallower than that of the observations ( kang et al .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that it is difficult for the sams to build a scenario that permits low mass spiral to be averagely younger than high mass system in the hierarchical cosmogonies .",
    "parametrized modelling , which adopts phenomenological descriptions for some complicated processes , is another fruitful tool to explore the galactic formation and evolution ( tinsley 1980 ) .",
    "in fact , parametric models have been successfully applied to investigate the formation and evolution of the milky way disk ( chang et al . 1999 ; chiappini et al .",

    "besides these specific galaxies , boissier & prantzos ( 2000 , hereafter bp00 ) extended their calibrated model on the milky way disk to study the chemical and spectro - photometric evolution of disk galaxies and compared their model predictions with the observed cmrs of de jong ( 1996 ) .",
    "they found satisfactory agreement with local observations provided that the star formation time - scales of low - mass galaxies are longer than their high - mass counterparts .",
    "however , their model predictions have not been compared with observations at higher redshift due to the limited observations at that time .",
    "recently , several new scaling relations of disk galaxies are statistically found and huge amount of observed data are available , not only in the local universe but also for intermediate and high redshift galaxies . motivated by the work of bp00",
    ", we try to construct a new parametric model to explain the observed correlations in both local and intermediate redshift universe .",
    "our results show that the mass - sfr relations at intermediate redshifts provide tight constraints on the modelling of gas cooling history .",

    "we describe main assumptions and ingredients of our model in details .",
    "comparisons between model predictions and observations and our main results are given in section 3 .",
    "discussions are presented in section 4 and the last section summarizes our main conclusions .",
    "we assume that the disk galaxy has been embedded in a dark matter halo and primordial gas within the dark halo cools down to form a rotationally supported disk .",
    "the disk is basically assumed to be sheet - like and composed by a set of independent rings , each 500pc wide , that is , there is no gas radial flow between different rings .",
    "the details and essentials of our model are outlined in below sections .      in the local universe ,",
    "galactic stellar mass @xmath1 is the primary parameter that determines main properties of the galaxy ( kauffmann et al .",

    "2006a ) . in this paper",
    ", we assume @xmath1 is the primary parameter and all free parameters in our model are dependent on @xmath1 , where @xmath1 is referred to the stellar mass of a galaxy at present time ( i.e. , z=0 ) if there is no specific notations .    for a present - day galaxy with galactic stellar mass @xmath1",
    ", we assume the stellar mass surface density in the current time @xmath5 follows an exponential profile : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the cosmic age at the present time , which is 13.5 gyr for the cosmogony adopted here ( see following subsection ) .",

    "we adopt their observed @xmath12 relation of late - type galaxies in z - band ( equation 18 and table 1 of shen et al .",
    "2003 ) to determine @xmath15 by adopting @xmath16 for a pure exponential disk , since z - band is a good indicator of the stellar mass .",
    "gas cooling is one of the key processes in modeling galactic formation and evolution .",

    "2006 ; fontanot et al .",
    "2009 ) , have presented a method to describe gas cooling process . however , there are still some open questions , for example , how to describe the mass and angular momentum distributions of baryons in dark matter halo and their variations with time , and whether the specific angular momentum conserves or not during gas cooling processes etc .",
    "( efstathiou 2000 ; bullock et al .",
    "2002 ; chen et al .",
    "none of these questions has an answer clear enough to construct a simple model , at least at the present stage of our knowledge .    in this paper",
    ", we turn to another approach , i.e. , the phenomenological approach , which adopts a parametric description for some complicated processes .",
    "comparisons between model predictions and observations may suggest possible ranges for model free parameters in the model and then help to know more information about main properties of the processes described by these parameters .",
    "we assume that there is 1 gyr time delay for the disk galaxy formation , which corresponds to @xmath17 under the adopted cosmology in this paper .",
    "after that , the disk origins and grows by continuous gas infall from the dark halo and the metallicity of the infalling gas is primordial .",
    "differing from bp00 , who adopted an exponential infall rate , we follow prantzos & silk ( 1998 ) and chang et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and adopt a gaussian formula of gas infall rate .",
    "comparison between exponential - infall model and gaussian - infall model will be presented in section 4 .    the gaussian infall rate @xmath18 ( in units of @xmath19 ) is assumed to be : @xmath20 where @xmath0 is the characteristic time corresponding to the maximum gas infall rate ( hereafter , we call @xmath0 as the infall - peak time ) and @xmath21 is the full width at half maximum of the peak .",
    "we adopt @xmath22 throughout this paper to promise a relatively wide distribution of the infall rate .",
    "in fact , our calculations show that the varying of @xmath21 in the range @xmath23 gyr do not have large influence on the results .",
    "the @xmath24 are a set of separate quantities determined by the boundary condition @xmath5 . in practice , we iteratively obtain @xmath24 by normalizing the resulted stellar mass surface density distribution at @xmath25 to be very close to its observed value @xmath5",
    ".    we should emphasize that the infall - peak time @xmath0 is the most important free parameter in our model that determines main properties of gas infall history .",
    "indeed , @xmath0 regulates the shape of gas accretion history .",
    "for example , @xmath26 corresponds to a time - declining infall rate , while @xmath27 corresponds to a time - increasing gas infall rate .",
    "since we only focus on the global quantities of galaxy in this paper , we assume @xmath0 does not vary with radius @xmath28 but may be dependent on the galactic stellar mass @xmath1 .    in this paper , we assume a cosmology with @xmath29 and @xmath30 . correspondingly , the cosmic time at z = 0 is @xmath31 gyr and the cosmic time at z =3 ( 0.4 ) is t = 2gyr ( 9gyr ) .",
    "star formation ( sf ) process is so complicated that it is very difficult to fully understand the physical nature of star formation regulation ( silk 1997 , kennicutt 1998a , b , elmegreen 2002 ) .",
    "fortunately , observations of galaxies on global scales reveal a tight correlation between the average star formation rate per unit area and the mean surface density of cold gas ( e.g. kennicutt 1998a , b ) . this observed relation",
    "is later called as kennicutt sf law .",
    "recently , kennicutt et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that , on spatial scales extending down to at least 500 pc , the star formation rate ( sfr ) surface density also correlates with the local gas surface density , following a similar power law as that of the global quantities .",
    "we adopt the kennicutt sf law in this paper : @xmath32 where the sfr surface density @xmath33 is measured in units of @xmath19 and the cold gas surface density @xmath34 is in units of @xmath35",
    ".    regarding the chemical evolution of the galactic disk , both instantaneous - recycling approximation ( ira ) and instantaneous mixing of the gas with stellar ejecta is assumed , i.e. , the gas in a fixed ring is characterized by a unique composition at each epoch of time .",
    "we take the classical set of equations of galactic chemical evolution from tinsley ( 1980 ) and adopt the return fraction @xmath36 and stellar yield @xmath37 .    the updated stellar population synthesis ( sps ) model of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) , i.e. , cb07 , is adopted in the present paper , with the stellar imf being taken from chabrier ( 2003 ) .",
    "the lower and upper mass limits are adopted to be @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "gas outflow process may also influence the evolution of galactic disk . during the continuous star formation and evolution process , supernova ( sn ) explosions eject part of energy into interstellar medium and some amount of gas will be heated and expelled from the galactic disk if its kinematic energy exceeds the bonding energy .",
    "therefore , gas outflow rate may be proportional to the sn explosion rate and then proportional to sfr surface density @xmath33 if the initial mass function ( imf ) does not vary with time .",
    "furthermore , gas outflow rate may also correlate with galactic mass since low mass galaxies have shallower potential wells and then it is much easier for them to expel gas out than high mass systems ( kauffmann et al .",
    "1993 ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we assume the outflowing gas has the same metallicity as that of the interstellar medium at that time and will not fall again to the disk .",
    "the gas outflow rate @xmath40 ( in units of @xmath19 ) is assumed to be proportional to the sfr surface density @xmath33 : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is another free parameter in our model and may also be a function of galactic stellar mass @xmath1 . integrating the left side of the above equation",
    ", we derive @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the total mass expelled from the galaxy . integrating the right side of eq .",
    "5 gets @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the return fraction .",
    "then , we derive @xmath47 . therefore , @xmath42 is proportional to the fraction of total mass expelled relative to the final mass locked in stars .    in summary ,",
    "our primary input parameter is the galactic stellar mass @xmath1 .",
    "free parameters are infall - peak time @xmath0 and outflow parameter @xmath48 .",
    "the combination of gas infall rate and outflow rate determines the variation rate of the total ( gas+star ) mass surface density . assuming the initial total surface density to be zero , we can numerically obtain the total mass surface density at any time after free parameters being given .",
    "adding the sf law , we can describe how many cold gas turns into stellar mass and then calculate the chemical and color evolution of the disk . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that there is no scatter of the model parameters @xmath0 and @xmath42 at any given @xmath1 .",
    "in other words , our simple model only investigates the average trend of the correlations between different quantities and does not include their scatters .",
    "using the above model , for one galaxy at given @xmath1 , we independently calculate the evolution of cold gas in each ring along the galactic disk . at each time step , we derive a set of individual quantities , such as the sfr surface density , gas mass surface density , multi - band luminosity and metallicity , and then integrate them to obtain the global quantities for the whole galaxy .",
    "after that , our model predictions can be directly compared with observations .    in this section",
    ", we present our main results step by step .",
    "firstly , we briefly describe the adopted observations to be compared with model predictions .",
    "then , we investigate the influence of free parameters on model predictions , including not only @xmath0 and @xmath42 , but also the constance in the sf law . finally , we construct a reasonable mass - dependent model and explore if its predictions can be consistent with the observed data .      here ,",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=302 ]    accordingly , we also assume that infall time - scale @xmath82 is only dependent on the stellar mass . to be consistent with the observed data",
    ", we adopt the form of @xmath87 as : @xmath88 which gives that the infall time - scale of massive galaxy ( @xmath89 ) is positive and decreases with the increase of @xmath1 , while the infall time - scale of low - mass galaxy ( @xmath90 ) is negative and increases with the decrease of @xmath1 .",
    "it should be pointed out that , although @xmath87 is discontinue at @xmath91 , the gas infall history described by the adopted @xmath87 varies smoothly from increasing with time to being constant and then to decreasing with time as galaxy changes from low - mass to intermediate and then to high - mass systems .    to visually compare the gaussian and exponential infall rate , fig .",
    "6 plots the gas infall history and total star formation history of two galaxies @xmath92 and @xmath93 , which are normalized by @xmath85 ( left two panels ) and @xmath94 ( right two panels ) , respectively .",
    "the solid and dash lines represent the model results adopting gaussian and exponential infall rate . according to the assumption that there is 1gyr delay for the halo formation , all of the gas infall throughout this paper begin at @xmath95 .",
    "it shows that , comparing with the star formation rate predicted by gaussian - infall model , the exponential - infall model predicts higher sfr at early stage and lower sfr later .",
    "this point directly results in the differences of the mass - sfr relations at intermediate redshifts predicted by these two models ( see following discussions ) .    in order to compare with the observations , we plot the predictions of the exponential - infall model as dash lines in fig . 4 and 5 .",
    "it can be seen that , although both the solid and dash lines can be roughly consistent with the local observations , the exponential - infall model does predict lower @xmath4 than observations at intermediate redshifts . since the stellar population of local galaxy",
    "is resulted along its whole star formation history , local observations do not have the ability to distinguish whether the model is viable at different time steps .",
    "fortunately , the observed data at intermediate redshifts are now available and can provide tighter constraints on the model of galactic evolution .",
    "in other words , our results suggest that the gaussian infall rate may be more reasonable to describe the gas cooling process than the exponential infall rate .",
    "in fact , by fitting synthetic energy distribution to the multi - band photometry of a sample of actively star - forming galaxies at @xmath96 , maraston et al .",
    "( 2010 ) concluded that adopting an exponentially increasing sfrs and a high starting redshift appear to provide more reasonable results than that of an exponentially declining sfr in the case of star forming galaxies at redshift beyond @xmath97 .",
    "unfortunately , both their model and ours are phenomenological models .",
    "it is still beyond the scope of this paper to answer why the efficiency of gas cooling process or / and star formation process may be depressed at early stage and why the infall - peak time of low - mass galaxy is later than high - mass systems .",
    "indeed , the semi - analytical models and studies using hydrodynamical simulations may provide more physical and reasonable explanation on how gas accreted onto the galaxies than phenomenological models .",
    "however , there is still a long way to go to fully understand the gas cooling processes .",
    "for example , the semi - analytical models assumes that gas within galaxy halos initially reaches the temperature of the virial halo , while some studies using high - resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations found that the majority of baryons may never reach the virial temperature as they accreted onto galaxies ( keres et al .",
    "2005 ; dekel @xmath98 birboim 2006 ) .",
    "brooks et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found that low - mass galaxies are instead dominated by accretion of gas that stays well below the viral temperature and even for galaxies at higher masses , cold flows dominate the growth of the disk at early times .",
    "all these findings called the general virial temperature assumption into question , but may give more information to improve the semi - analytical models and help us to understand more clearly on how the gas gets into the galaxies .",
    "finally , comparing our model to that of bp00 , the main difference is that bp00 adopted the exponential infall rate while we adopt the gaussian infall rate .",
    "bp00 also notice the fact that , if the exponential declining infall rate is assumed , the predicted stellar population will be too old to reproduce the observed blue colors of low - mass galaxies even if the infall time - scale tends to be as large as @xmath99 .",
    "they assumed a negative infall time - scale for the most extended and less massive galaxies in their model , i.e. the infall rate increases with time .",
    "however , according to our discussions above , we guess that the model of bp00 may predict lower @xmath4 at intermediate redshift than the observed data although their model predictions can be in good agreement with the local observations .",
    "in this paper , we present a phenomenological model for the formation and evolution of disk galaxies . it is assumed that the disk origins and grows by gas infall .",
    "we adopt the gaussian form of gas infall rate with one free parameter , infall - peak time @xmath0 .",
    "we also include the contribution of gas outflow induced by supernova feedback .",
    "the kennicutt star formation law is adopted to describe how much cold gas turns into stellar mass .",
    "we calculate the evolution of disk galaxies and compare model predictions with observations .",
    "we find that :    1 .",
    "model predictions are very sensitive to the infall - peak time @xmath0 in that the model adopting later @xmath0 results in blue colors , low metallicity , high specific star formation rate and high gas fraction , while gas outflow rate mainly influences the gas - phase metallicity and star formation efficiency mainly influences the gas fraction .",
    "we construct a mass - dependent model by assuming that low mass galaxy has later @xmath0 and larger @xmath48 than massive systems .",
    "it is shown that our mode predictions are in fairly agree with not only the local observations , but also the observed mass - sfr relations at intermediate redshifts .",
    "it shows that , comparing with the star formation rate predicted by the gaussian - infall model , the exponential - infall model predicts higher star formation rate at early stage and lower star formation rate later .",
    "our results suggest that the gaussian infall rate may be more reasonable to describe the gas cooling process than the exponential infall rate , especially for low - mass systems .",
    "we emphasize that , here we present a phenomenological model . through comparison between model predictions and observations ,",
    "our main aim is to investigate main properties of the formation and evolution of disk galaxy , especially the trend as a function of galactic stellar mass .",
    "unfortunately , there is still a long way to go to fully understand why low - mass galaxy may have later infall - peak time than high - mass systems and why the gaussian infall rate may be more prefered than the exponential infall rate .",
