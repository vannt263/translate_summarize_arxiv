    "accurately predicting the structural properties of cold dark matter ( cdm ) haloes is one of the fundamental goals of modern cosmology .",

    "observations of massive elliptical galaxies , which have non - negligible uncertainties in subtracting off the stars , favour these cuspy haloes over cores ( @xmath11 ) or contracted haloes @xcite .",
    "however , observations of dark matter dominated systems , where subtracting off the baryons is less problematic , have yet to find convincing evidence of these cusps .",
    "rather , they tend to favour shallower inner density slopes @xmath12 both in low - mass galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and galaxy clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these discrepancies are a potentially fatal problem for the cdm paradigm , and has thus motivated studying other flavours of dark matter that have similar behaviour to cdm on large scales , but differ on small scales .",
    "popular examples are warm dark matter ( wdm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and self - interacting dark matter ( sidm ; * ? ? ?",
    "one can also consider more exotic models that have a coupling between the dark matter and dark energy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since the baryons make up @xmath13 @xcite of the mass in the universe , to first order it might seem reasonable to assume that baryons only have a small effect on the structure of dark matter haloes .",
    "however , one needs to consider that baryons and dark matter are not equally mixed .",
    "baryons can dissipate their energy , leading to higher baryon to dark matter ratios in the centres of galaxies .",
    "it is not uncommon for the baryons to dominate the mass budget inside galaxy half - light radii ( e.g. , fig.2 of * ? ? ?",
    "baryonic processes are known that can cause both expansion and contraction of dark matter haloes at small radii .",
    "if the accretion of baryons on to the central galaxy is smooth and slow then dark matter haloes should contract adiabatically @xcite .",
    "this process can increase the density of dark matter haloes by an order of magnitude .",
    "in contrast , other processes can cause the dark matter halo to expand : rapid mass - loss and/or time variability of the potential due to feedback from stars @xcite or active galactic nuclei ( agn ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; mergers and stripping of smaller subhaloes that were puffed up by stellar feedback @xcite ; and transfer of energy / angular momentum from baryons to the dark matter via dynamical friction due to minor mergers @xcite , or galactic bars @xcite .",
    "supernova feedback that can alter galactic potentials plays other important roles in the formation of galaxies .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , these simulations generally find that the contraction is weaker than predicted by the @xcite and @xcite models .",
    "a potentially serious problem with these simulations is they over predict the stellar masses of galaxies , and thus it is not clear how applicable they are to galaxies in the real universe .",
    "more recent simulations , with stronger feedback and hence more realistic stellar to halo mass rations , report weak contraction or no change in the dark matter mass profiles on mw mass scales @xcite .    on the scale of dwarf galaxies ( @xmath15 ) ,",
    "a number of different groups have presented fully cosmological hydrodynamical simulations in which the dark matter halo expands @xcite . in these simulations stellar feedback was found to drive rapid ( sub - dynamical ) time variability of the potential .",
    "dark matter particles orbiting in such a potential gain energy , resulting in halo expansion @xcite .",
    "the use of different hydrodynamical codes and sub - grid models suggests that halo expansion is not a numerical artefact , or due to a specific modelling of the subgrid physics .",
    "these apparently conflicting results on dwarf and mw mass scales can be reconciled if the halo response depends , on average , on the halo mass , @xmath16 , galaxy stellar mass , @xmath17 , or the integrated efficiency of star formation , @xmath18 @xcite found that the inner dark matter density slope , @xmath19 , was more strongly correlated with @xmath6 , than galaxy or halo mass . at very low efficiencies ,",

    "as described below , nihao and magicc use a similar star formation and feedback model , and form the ` correct ' amount of stars .",

    "there is also clearly a much wider range in dark matter profiles in the hydro simulations .",
    "for example , at 1% of the virial radius , the dmo simulations show an absolute variation in dark matter circular velocity of just a factor of 2 , whereas the hydro simulations show an order of magnitude spread .      the change in dark matter profiles",

    "the magicc and nihao simulations span a similar range of halo response , while the mugs simulations are among the most contracted . amongst other things , this shows that the role of the hydrodynamics ( which has been improved in nihao versus magicc ) plays a subdominant role to the strength of the feedback .",
    "changes are larger at smaller radii , both when the haloes expand and contract . at radii greater than @xmath90 of the virial radius ,",
    "there is little change in the dark matter profile .",
    "this is to be expected , since the half - mass radii of the stars are typically between 0.5 and 5 per cent of the virial radius . at these scales , where baryons condense and stars form",
    ", there is a wide range of halo responses . at 1% of the virial radius the halo circular velocity increases and decreases by up to factor of @xmath91 , corresponding to a change in enclosed mass by a factor of @xmath92 .",
    "clearly , baryons can have a major impact on the structure of the dark matter halo .",
    "this plot also highlights the importance of spatial resolution . in order to see significant expansion or contraction",
    ", simulations need to be able to resolve scales significantly smaller than @xmath93 of the virial radius .",
    "our simulations resolve @xmath94 of the virial radius across three decades in halo mass .",

    "of these four fundamental parameters star formation efficiency is the best predictor of halo response ( @xmath113 ) , followed by compactness ( @xmath114 ) , stellar mass ( @xmath115 ) and halo mass ( @xmath116 ) .",

    "when looking at average halo profiles in bins of halo mass from @xmath285 to @xmath286 , @xcite finds almost no difference in dark matter profiles between hydro and dmo simulations .",

    "<S> we use @xmath0 cosmological galaxy formation ` zoom - in ' simulations using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code gasoline to study the effect of baryonic processes on the mass profiles of cold dark matter haloes . </S>",
    "<S> the haloes in our study range from dwarf ( @xmath1 ) to milky way ( @xmath2 ) masses . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations exhibit a wide range of halo responses , primarily varying with mass , from expansion to contraction , with up to factor @xmath3 changes in the enclosed dark matter mass at 1 per cent of the virial radius . </S>",
    "<S> confirming previous studies , the halo response is correlated with the integrated efficiency of star formation : @xmath4 . in addition , we report a new correlation with the compactness of the stellar system : @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we provide an analytic formula depending on @xmath6 and @xmath7 for the response of cold dark matter haloes to baryonic processes . </S>",
    "<S> an observationally testable prediction is that , at fixed mass , larger galaxies experience more halo expansion , while the smaller galaxies more halo contraction . </S>",
    "<S> this diversity of dark halo response is captured by a toy model consisting of cycles of adiabatic inflow ( causing contraction ) and impulsive gas outflow ( causing expansion ) . for net outflow , or equal inflow and outflow fractions , @xmath8 , </S>",
    "<S> the overall effect is expansion , with more expansion with larger @xmath8 . for net inflow </S>",
    "<S> , contraction occurs for small @xmath8 ( large radii ) , while expansion occurs for large @xmath8 ( small radii ) , recovering the phenomenology seen in our simulations . </S>",
    "<S> these regularities in the galaxy formation process provide a step towards a fully predictive model for the structure of cold dark matter haloes .    </S>",
