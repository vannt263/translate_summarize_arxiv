    "in an earlier publication @xcite a systematic study of axial current ( partial ) conservation was begun in the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) approach to nuclear bound states .",
    "there it was found that partial conservation of axial current ( pcac ) puts constraints not only on the form of the axial current operator , but also on the nuclear wave function , by way of fixing the  potential \" entering the nuclear bs equation .",
    "since the pion production / absorption amplitude is an integral part of the conserved axial current nuclear matrix element , the same constraints are imposed on it as well .",
    "it stands to reason that the same kind of constraint will carry over into the nonrelativistic ( nr ) formalism . in this paper",
    "we extend the work in ref .",
    "@xcite to the nonrelativistic description of the nucleus .",
    "we do not make a direct nonrelativistic reduction of the bs equations and amplitudes from ref .",
    "@xcite , for they are well known not to have a good nr limit , but rather use this reference as a guide to developing the corresponding result within the schr \" odinger equation approach .",
    "we shall show that even at this nonrelativistic level there are differences between the various versions of the @xmath2 model used in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the aforementioned pcac consistency condition between the ( elementary ) pion production mechanism and the nn potential determining the nuclear wave equation is a novel feature promising to introduce a higher level of logical coherence into present day calculations of pion production on nuclear targets .",
    "as an example one may consider the @xmath3 and @xmath4 reactions . there , in particular , the @xmath5-production mechanism ( operator ) has often been considered without any reference to the nuclear wave functions @xcite .",
    "several models involving scalar @xmath2-meson - exchange pion production  current \" , besides the @xmath5-exchange one , have been proposed @xcite .",
    "we shall show here exactly which @xmath2-meson - exchange @xmath5-production operator must be included and how when the two - nucleon potential contains a one - sigma - exchange term , and _",
    "vice versa_. it turns out that this @xmath5-production operator is rather sensitive to the details of the sigma model used .",
    "we also analyze the @xmath6-meson - exchange @xmath5-production operator required by the presence of the @xmath6-meson - exchange potential .",
    "this paper falls into five sections . after the introduction , in section  ii",
    ", we define the context of our analysis and prove our most general result : the necessity of two - body axial currents for interacting two- ( or more ) particle systems obeying nonrelativistic quantum mechanics . in section",
    "iii we construct two - nucleon axial currents that respect pcac at the level of _ nuclear _ matrix elements , starting from three underlying relativistic chirally symmetric meson - nucleon model lagrangians . in section",
    "iv we present the three corresponding sets of two - nucleon @xmath5-production operators as an example of the main proposition and we discuss the results . in section  v we summarize and draw the conclusions .",
    "the notion of pcac is both historically and conceptually the foundation of chiral symmetry in hadronic interactions .",
    "modern implementations of this symmetry , such as the nuclear chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath7 ) , however , do not emphasize that point . in the following",
    "we shall try and present another viewpoint of pcac that will bear significance to nuclear physics in general and pion - nuclear processes in particular . in short , pcac states that the hadronic axial current @xmath8 must satisfy the following continuity equation @xmath9 or equivalently @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the ( canonical ) pion field operator . in the quantum mechanical framework",
    "this can be written as an equation relating the divergence of the three - current and the commutator of the hamiltonian and the axial charge density : @xmath12 = - f_{\\pi } m_{\\pi}^2 \\pi^{a}({\\bf r})~.   % \\langle \\pi_{\\rm 2-body}^{a } \\rangle   \\label{e : qmcont}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation is a consequence of the ( exact ) heisenberg equations of motion .",
    "now we specialize to nonrelativistic nuclear physics by limiting ourselves to that subspace of the complete hilbert space that contains at most two ( real ) nucleons interacting by exchanging one ( virtual ) meson at a time . there",
    "the total hamiltonian of the nucleus @xmath13 is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies @xmath14 of the nucleons , and the total axial current @xmath15 consists of one- and two - nucleon parts .",
    "we assume that the axial charge density @xmath16 in the current and charge operators , except when necessary to avoid confusion . ]",
    "is well approximated by its one - nucleon part @xmath17 .",
    "this assumption agrees with - indeed it follows from - our fundamental assumption of nonrelativistic nuclear dynamics .",
    "this means that all ( relativistic ) operators are expanded in powers of @xmath18 ; this provides a convenient book - keeping device in what follows .",
    "as shall be shown below , the ( partial ) continuity equation ( [ e : qmcont ] ) strongly constrains ( the longitudinal part of ) the nuclear axial current , and in particular its two - nucleon , or meson - exchange part .",
    "we may break up the axial current conservation equation into one- and two - body parts without loss of generality .",
    "the divergence of the complete one - body current equals @xmath19 times the commutator of the kinetic energy @xmath20 and the one - body axial charge density @xmath21 - f_{\\pi } m_{\\pi}^2 \\pi^{a}({\\rm 1-body } ) ~ , \\label{e:1bdiv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is of @xmath22 , i.e. , zero to leading order in @xmath18 , due to similar momentum dependencies of the kinetic energy @xmath20 and the axial charge density @xmath23 operators , as well as to the absence of non - diagonal isospin operators from @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , the test of conservation of the complete nuclear axial current is whether or not the potential @xmath24 commutes with the one - body axial charge density .",
    "it turns out that , due to the momentum operator inside of @xmath25 , only a completely trivial , viz .",

    "@xmath34 , except the trivial one , i.e. , a constant : @xmath35 . and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "our proposition has been confirmed in all cases that we have studied so far , which cases constitute some of the most important parts of the nuclear nn potential . ] in other words , _ axial meson exchange currents ( mec ) @xmath37 are always necessary , so long as two nucleons interact and their dynamics can be described by quantum mechanics_. the same conclusions , of course , hold in nonrelativistic ( nr ) quark models , i.e. , axial two - quark currents are always necessary in nr quark models , as well .",
    "it is the compelling nature of this argument that makes it distinct from previous arguments along similar lines @xcite .",
    "this is perhaps a somewhat surprising result in view of the fact that the em current conservation does _ not _ require mecs for many parts of the nuclear potential , e.g. for the contributions from the exchange of neutral mesons .",
    "hence it will be our task to construct axial mecs associated with the exchange of the most important , i.e. , the lightest , mesons .",

    "the isovector vector @xmath39 meson can not be introduced in a model - independent way , so we leave it for another occasion .    to reveal the necessity of consistency between the nuclear wave functions and the nuclear pion production / absorption amplitude we must remember that the operator equation ( [ e : qmcont ] ) describing pcac is just a shorthand for the same statement about _ all _ axial current nuclear matrix elements @xmath40 . in momentum space the heisenberg equations of motion lead to @xmath41 \\rangle_{fi }    \\nonumber \\\\ & = &   i \\left({f_{\\pi } m_{\\pi}^2 \\over{q^{2 } - m_{\\pi}^2 } } \\right )   \\langle \\gamma_{\\pi}^{a } \\rangle_{fi }    \\nonumber \\\\",

    "( [ e : divme ] ) we used @xmath49 , which is true for elastic scattering in the breit frame , i.e. , when @xmath50 .",
