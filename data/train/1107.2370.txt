    "large n qcd ( @xcite ) is a remarkable mathematical problem , having most desirable universality and at the same time being close enough to reality . being solved with proper generality , it may serve as a basis for quantitative theory of hadrons , by means of systematic expansion in inverse powers of @xmath1 . however , all attempts to do so in the past met the brick wall of infrared divergencies .    in most simple terms , the infrared divergency is the fact that spectrum of the theory is discrete whereas in perturbation theory it is continuous .",
    "there are freely flying interacting quarks and gluons , which all must get confined so that physical spectrum consists instead of infinitely rising regge trajectories of mesons and glueballs .",
    "duality-plane.025.psc:/users/sasha/documents/graphics/duality-plane.pdf    everybody believes in this picture now , though it was never rigorously proven .",
    "the real question is how to transform the sum of planar graphs of large n qcd into some sensible expansion for hadronic spectrum .",
    "this must be doable , as the effective coupling at hadron scale is not so large , and hadrons are not far from some bag model of free quarks .",
    "the spatial bag is of course unacceptable , as it totally screws the particle spectrum being non - relativistic and transitionally non - invariant .",
    "it was almost 35 years ago that i attempted to solve this problem and made some advances ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "i developed systematic method of approximating the meromorphic function like 2-point function of gauge invariant composite fields in large n qcd as a sum of infinite number of pole terms with positive residues .",
    "for such an approximation to be unique it has to have higher than powerlike convergence at large euclidean momenta  otherwise moving poles or changing residues would be allowed without changing leading powerlike term as long as the net change in power terms decreases faster than this asymprotic term , say @xmath2 with @xmath3 being usual momentum squared in minkowski space .    for example",
    "the first meromorphic function which comes to the mind of any grad student would be @xmath4 but it approaches its logarithmic asymptotics with powerlike corrections which means that positions and residues of its poles are ambiguous . on the contrary , the ratio of bessel functions approaches its logarithmic asymptotics with exponential accuracy .",
    "the soft perturbations of cft corresponding to negative power terms in @xmath5 will be altered by powerlike terms like we have in the @xmath6 function , but preserved with ratio of bessel functions .",
    "conversely , any such soft correction must modify the bessel functions to something else otherwise it will never appear in asymptotic expansion . in this paper",
    "we will once again explain how the perturbations of the mass spectrum  can be recovered from the soft perturbations of cft .",
    "there are theorems in pade theory @xcite which guarantee that so called stieltjes - function ( analytic in cut plane with positive discontinuity across the cut ) preserve this property in any order of approximation .",
    "the poles of pade approximant are all located along the cut with positive residues  so that discontinuity reduces to finite sum of positive @xmath7 terms .",
    "this stieltjes - function property generalizes to arbitrary matrix functions of one variable in which case it becomes equivalent to one particle unitarity + analyticity . in the limit when number of particles goes to infinity",
    "this property is just what we need in large n qcd .",
    "so , the limit of infinite number of poles with fixed positions , introduced and studied in @xcite represents the correct framework for large n confining theory regardless of its asymprotic properties at large euclidean momenta . in case of asymptotically conformal ( or asymptotically free ) theory",
    "the pade regularization further simplifies and produces explicit calculable results depending of values of operator dimensions ( normal or anomalous ) .    in this paper",
    "we briefly summarize this theory and advance it further , producing explicit terms of perturbation expansion of qcd mass ratios in terms of calculable terms of perturbation expansion of the ( matrix of ) 2-point functions of conformal fields .",
    "we use dimensional regularization which fits nicely into our framework , and supplement it by infrared regularization using matrix pade theory in the limit of infinite number of poles .",
    "important step is that we are able to eliminate the infrared cutoff in every order in dimensionless effective coupling @xmath8 , normalized so that it must be set to @xmath9 after summation of perturbation expansion .",
    "this is continuation of old work @xcite , but unlike that old work , now we produce analytic rather than numerical formulas",
    ". given planar graphs for the matrix of 2-point function , which are universal functions of @xmath10 times powers of @xmath11where @xmath12 is thoofts coupling constant and @xmath13 is dimension of space .",
    "note that at any positive @xmath14 we still expect confinement to hold , as it is known for @xmath15 .",
    "the spectral function of 2-point functions of renormalized conformal tensor fields in qcd are finite in any order of expansion in running coupling constant , which we normalize at the infrared cutoff @xmath16 .",
    "yes , we are simply presenting infinity - free perturbation expansion for large n qcd observables with calculable coefficients and nice physical properties ( zeroth approximation corresponds to masses proportional to roots of bessel functions in agreement with experiment ) .",
    "terms of our expansion correspond to planar graphs , but after pade regularization and dimensional transmutations all cutoffs disappear and we get universal numbers just as we should .",
    "there is no ambiguity nor approximations in computing these numbers , do not get misled by the words `` pade approximation '' .",
    "we start with approximation , but later take the limit returning us to original theory after renormalizing coupling constant .",
    "the infrared cutoff @xmath16 describing spacial scale of the infrared regularization is tend to @xmath17 term by term in perturbation expansion ( to be more precise this limit corresponds to effective coupling constant @xmath18 ) .",
    "complex-plane.004.psc:/users/sasha/documents/graphics/complex-plane.pdf    let us consider some cft perturbed by some set of soft operators such as mass terms .",
    "we shall further assume that this is confining @xmath19 theory , with only planar graphs left and discrete spectrum of masses rising all the way to infinity to match cft asymptotics in deep euclidean region of momenta .",
    "in this limit we know very important property of the infinite matrix @xmath20 of 2-point functions of bilinear quark operators @xmath21 : free particle unitarity + analyticity .",
    "this is meromorphic matrix function of the form:@xmath22 we are working with functions of single variable @xmath5 ( in minkowski metric ) assuming that kinematical factors depending on direction of momentum are involved in definition of states @xmath23 .",
    "so , in general the state @xmath24 depends upon @xmath25 @xmath26and the 2-point function @xmath27 is an irreducible tensor built of @xmath28 .",
    "for example , for conserved vector currents @xmath29 there must be tensor @xmath30 . in higher order operators",
    "@xmath31 with @xmath32 being one of 16 independent matrices for dirac spinors , there will be multiple invariant tensor terms in 2-point function , depending on  @xmath28 .",
    "we shall ignore these details at this general stage of discussion , leaving them for the next section where we switch to qcd .",
    "unitarity implies that matrix spectral density@xmath33 vanishes outside of the positive axis where it reduces to infinite number of positive definite pole terms@xmath34 the matrix positivity property of the spectral function@xmath35 for arbitrary state @xmath36 as well as absence of singularities outside positive axis in complex @xmath37 plane is characteristic of so called stieltjes functions .",
    "the discrete spectrum is not necessary for a function to belong to stieltjes class , for example @xmath38 is a stieltjes function .",
    "more up to a point , the 2-point function in any order of naive perturbation expansion is also a stieltjes function .",
    "we expect it to remain such function beyond perturbation theory , but the continuum spectrum condense to a discrete one .    in the leading order of any cft , including of course the free quark - gluon theory",
    ", the operators of different dimension do not correlate .",
    "there are growing conformal families of operators with the same dimension , corresponding to eigenstates of dilatation operator .",
    "in general case , beyond leading approximation , the matrix of 2-point functions will become non - diagonal , so that more general version of pade theory must be employed to guarantee unitarity + analyticity in whole hilbert space of infinite number of free mesons .",
    "this theory ( @xcite ) is a straightforward matrix generalization of one - dimensional pade theory .",
    "the pade approximant is essentially a continued fraction , which is obtained by sequence of transformations@xmath39 the constant matrix @xmath40 is defined up to irrelevant right multiplication by unitary matrix , for a positive hermitian @xmath41 in euclidean region @xmath42 in terms of its eigenvectors @xmath43and positive eigenvalues @xmath44@xmath45    iterating these transformations forward we obtain the continued fraction@xmath46    let us invert [ contfrac]@xmath47    in order to find the value of @xmath48 we need to expand @xmath49 and we find@xmath50    this way we can recursively find these coefficients uniquely from the taylor expansion of original function @xmath51 @xmath52 .    the continued fraction will have @xmath53 form with polynomial numerator and denominator determined from recurrent equations@xmath54 truncation of continued fraction to @xmath55   $ ] approximant corresponds to setting@xmath56    and iterating equations backwards to @xmath57 the same equation in its inverse form:@xmath58 in the @xmath53 form the conservation of positivity is not immediately clear , but in original form [ contfrac ] we may prove it as follows . by taking discontinuity at @xmath59 at positive real @xmath60 of inverse relation [ inversecontfrac ]",
    "we find@xmath61    thus , by induction , all matrix functions @xmath62 starting with original one at @xmath63 are stieltjes matrix functions . moreover , we can prove by induction that all matrix functions @xmath62 are hermitian matrices at real @xmath64 , corresponding to euclidean region of momenta .",
    "takin hermitian conjugate of [ inversecontfrac ] and assuming that @xmath62 is hermitian we see that the same is true about @xmath65 : @xmath66    note that there is kind of gauge invariance of pade approximant with respect to right matrix multiplication by a constant matrix @xmath67 ( independent of @xmath68 : @xmath69    as for the left matrix multiplication it results in similarity transformation for @xmath70 so we can use it to diagonalize matrix @xmath71 at normalization point @xmath42.we use the gauge invariance to choose convenient normalization of these @xmath72 below .",
    "the continued fraction being good practical way to build finite order approximant , their general properties in the limit of large @xmath73 are better studied in the form suggested by pade himself for the general @xmath74   $ ] approximant:@xmath75    comparing coefficients at @xmath76 we get system of linear matrix equations for matrix coefficients of polynomials @xmath77 relating these coefficients to taylor coefficients of @xmath78 .",
    "namely , the last @xmath79 equations , which do not involve @xmath80 ( its expansion ending at @xmath81 ) produce linear equations for coefficients of @xmath82:@xmath83   _ { \\{m+1,m+n\\}}=0,\\ ] ]    where @xmath84   _ { \\{n , m\\}}$ ] stands for part of taylor expansion with degrees from @xmath85 to @xmath86 .    adding gauge condition , say @xmath87 we get unique solution for @xmath82 after which @xmath80 can be obtained directly as@xmath88   _ { \\{0,m\\ } } \\label{gq_0m}\\ ] ]    note that in this method we did not have to take any square roots from @xmath78 .",
    "so , is this really the same solution as we have built above using continued fraction ?",
    "let us check at the @xmath89   $ ] approximant .",
    "in continued fraction we get@xmath90    which is the same we would have obtained much easier from matrix pade equations:@xmath91    note that we could have represented the same continuos fraction differently:@xmath92    this is so called left matrix approximant , which is just another way to represent the same continuos fraction .",
    "the difference arises at the moment of truncation and tends to zero with order of approximation , as both approximants converge to the stiltjes matrix function with exponential or better convergence rate . in case of meromorphic function under consideration",
    "the convergence means that positions and residues of poles converge to correct values .",
    "interesting fact is that the pade approximation for masses decrease monotonously with order @xmath73 of approximation so they always overestimate true mass spectrum and converge to every mass from above .",
    "this remarkable property will be used below ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "writing pade equation [ generalpadeeq ] as dispersion integral with matrix spectral density we find set of linear equations for @xmath0 @xmath93    these equations mean that @xmath94 is an orthogonal matrix polynomial with respect to matrix measure@xmath95    the general solution [ gq_0 m ] for @xmath96 can be rewritten as dispersion integral @xmath97   _ { \\{0,n\\}}\\label{psolution}\\\\ &   = g_{0}(\\xi)q_{0}(\\xi)-\\left [   g_{0}(\\xi)q_{0}(\\xi)\\right ]   _ { \\{n+1,\\infty \\}}\\\\ &   = g(t)q(t)-\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{ds}{\\pi(s - t)}\\left (   \\frac{\\left ( 1+t/\\lambda\\right )   } { ( 1+s/\\lambda)}\\right )   ^{n+1}\\rho(s)q(s).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "let us represent the matrix spectral density as sum of power terms with decreasing powers , coming from soft perturbations of cft : @xmath98    here @xmath99 are mass dimensions of operators @xmath100 .",

    "we repeat old arguments here in what i hope is cleaner and simpler form .",
    "we shall treat taylor expansions as scalar products in space of all powers of one variable:@xmath136    so , our matrices @xmath137 are now also vectors in space of powers of @xmath37 in addition to being matrices in hilbert space .",

    "we just singled it out in our equations so that we can build perturbation expansion .",
    "now we se the confirmation that phase factors were chosen properly in the kernel @xmath112 .",

    "after that , standard perturbation theory wisdom can be applied , including level splitting , mixing and transitions .",
    "conformal classification of particles , valid in the zeroth and the first approximation , will break in higher orders and degeneracy of conformal multiplets will be removed .",

    "conformal symmetry will be broken down to the lorentz symmetry , and states will be classified accordingly , as relativistic particles , by spin and internal quantum numbers .",
    "let us discuss the mathematical meaning of pade regularization as described above .",
    "first , let us compare it with conventional pade approximation , in its matrix form .",
    "the conventional pade approximation at any order @xmath73 preserves the stieltjes property by placing poles at positive axis and guaranteeing positivity of residues .",
    "the same is true with the matrix generalization ( @xcite ) . in perturbation expansion",
    "the stieltjes property still holds but it degenerates to continuous spectrum of poles reproducing powerlike discontinuity with positive spectral density matrix . in  this sense matrix pade approximation",
    "gets us closer to reality than the perturbation expansion it approximates .",
    "it approximates the bad continuum spectrum by a good discrete one , but with so far incorrect masses .    or",
    "one may say that we are approximating original qcd by taking free meson theory of infinite number of particles as an anzatz and fitting their parameters to approximate perturbation theory as well as possible . at finite position @xmath126 the approximants of functions with continuum spectrum",
    "were proven to converge at @xmath157 absolutely in cut plane except vicinity of the real axis where the original continuous discontinuity is approximated by sum of delta functions .    in our case",
    "this is just the other way around .",
    "first of all , the true function is known to be meromorphic , so that ordinary pade approximant with finite position @xmath126 will approximate meromorphic function by a finite sum of poles .",
    "such approximation is known to converge even faster .",
    "second of all , we use the @xmath123-limit of pade approximant where it also becomes meromorphic .",
    "so we approximate meromorphic function by meromorphic function , by varying pole positions and residues to get minimal deviations from perturbation expansion at large euclidean momenta .",
    "how small are these deviations ?",
    "the bessel function , corresponding to zeroth order in perturbation expansion , approaches its powerlike asymptotics at @xmath158 with exponential accuracy:@xmath159 clearly , it has to be faster than any power , otherwise one would not be able to fix the pole positions and residues .",
    "one can arrange such shifts in pole position that the sum of poles would change only by @xmath160 with arbitrary large @xmath85 if we take many poles and conspire their shifts so that first @xmath161 terms of expansion in inverse powers of @xmath37 of these pole terms will all vanish .",
    "however , with exponential accuracy we have in @xmath123-limit , there is no room for the pole shifting",
    ". should one forget about such requirement , one could play with nice phenomenological `` models '' like @xmath162 with linearly rising spectrum of masses .",
    "we do not have a luxury of choosing the models which fit theoretical expectations or experimental data .",
    "we derive mass spectrum from planar graphs by regularizing them in the ir region .",
    "as qed did in its own time , true perturbation theory must be able to remove all cutoffs in observable quantities after certain renormalization .",
    "this is the goal of the next section .",
    "in case of perturbative qcd within dimensional regularization we simply have in above formulas @xmath163 where @xmath164   is space - time dimension . as usual , @xmath12 is thoofts constant in dimensional regularization , having dimension of @xmath165^{\\epsilon}$].coefficients @xmath166 ( sum of all planar graphs of order @xmath167 in coupling constant ) are some calculable functions of @xmath10 which we need in terms of laurent expansion in inverse powers of @xmath10 starting with @xmath168 .",
    "the limit @xmath169 can be performed in observables after dimensional transmutation ( see later ) .",
    "first of all we are pleased to note that in large order @xmath167 of perturbation expansion the ratios of @xmath170 functions in front of @xmath166 in our sums over @xmath167 decrease as factorials of @xmath167 so that we have absolute convergence of regularized perturbation expansion at any finite @xmath10 . as for convergence in four dimensions",
    ", it can not be proven so easily , because it requires taking the limit @xmath171 but let me make a following simple observation .",
    "the number of planar graphs grows only exponentially , as is well known , so that the divergence of perturbation expansion in the large n qcd has to do with growth of the feynman integrals at higher order @xmath167 . as t hooft argued long ago ,",
    "there are so called renormalons , namely condensing singularities in complex plane of coupling constant @xmath12 .",
    "these singularities reflect precisely the discrete spectrum of masses which are poles at @xmath172 where @xmath173 is physical mass scale .",
    "this @xmath173 behaves as @xmath174 at small @xmath12 so that growing mass spectrum corresponds to singularities in @xmath12 plane condensing to the origin as @xmath175 .",
    "these singularities make the origin an essential singularity point , eliminating any hopes for convergence of planar graph expansion for 2-point functions . at finite",
    "@xmath10 the renormalon argument still works , as in this case @xmath173 behaves as @xmath176 so that singularities in complex @xmath12 plane condense to the origin as @xmath177 .",
    "but the whole point of pade regularization is to solve this renormalon problem .",
    "we restore the correct analytic properties of 2-point function with infinite number of growing masses .",
    "the pade approximant in every order of our expansion has discrete spectrum , with density being equal to sum of delta functions .",
    "the observables we are expanding in perturbation series , do not depend on momentum variables these are precisely these discrete masses we are expanding in powers of effective coupling constant .",
    "the renormalon arguments simply do not apply once we made spectrum discrete . at finite @xmath10",
    "it is obvious because of extra factorial convergence we obtain in our expansion . at @xmath169",
    "we can not prove it but the common sense says that observable quantities have no singularities at @xmath178 , so they should at @xmath179 be close enough to what they are at @xmath180 .",
    "otherwise we will keep @xmath10 small and finite , compute observables and numerically extrapolate to @xmath179 .",
    "this is of course just a joke  perturbation expansion allows to set @xmath179 in every order after coupling renormalization .",
    "one may wonder how could we have avoided the simple fact that qcd mass scale has @xmath174 or @xmath181singularity at small coupling constant .",
    "how can we expand in coupling constant at all ?",
    "the answer is simple : at finite ir cutoff @xmath16 there are no singularity in the mass spectrum as a function of coupling constant .",
    "particles are confined in a ( fifth dimension ) box as part of regularization , so they have discrete rising spectrum even without interaction .",
    "the singularities would come back in the limit @xmath182 but we take another effective coupling @xmath8 which goes to @xmath9 in the ir limit without any singularities .    as physicists we all know that quarks are not very strongly interacting inside mesons , effective coupling is small enough to make free quark picture close to reality .",
    "it is just the limitations of modern qft technology which prevent us from computing masses and other observables of large n qcd with weakly interacting quarks at confinement scale .",
    "what we are suggesting here is the way around these limitations of perturbative qcd .",
    "i vividly remember discussion of my old paper with young ed witten in 1976 in boston .",
    "he quietly listened to my excited presentation of what i perceived as a solution of the ir divergency problem in qcd and he asked only one question : `` what is a physical meaning of your infrared cutoff @xmath16 ? '' .",
    "i could not have answered that question at that time , so i started waving hands .",
    "`` well , it preserves the positivity and correct analytic properties of qcd and its space - time symmetries , so there must be some physical interpretation , but honestly i do not know it .",
    "it must be a box in some extra dimension''said",
    "i without any idea what i was talking about .",
    "this was when the sales of my theory went down .",
    "nobody needed computational method without compelling physical picture , even if this was as fictitious as a string in some imaginary space .",
    "this reflects the basic laws of psychology : people care about stories more than they care about material things in life .",
    "i still can not answer ed s question today , though some fantastic physical picture have emerged with @xmath183 analogy .",
    "we now say that @xmath16 is a size of the box in fifth coordinate in @xmath184 space .",
    "this picture , unfortunately , is still incomplete .",
    "no @xmath185 model was found for large n qcd , only for some susy models with degenerate set of rg equations ( some coupling constants do not run and remain as free parameters ) .",
    "i think that there must be more general physical picture , without susy and cft .",
    "while everybody keeps looking for this general interpretation , we still can take @xmath123-limit of matrix pade approximant as a mathematical definition of large n qcd and study the regularized perturbation expansion in a hope to understand its physical meaning .",
    "let us consider pure qcd in glueball sector , which decouples at @xmath186 .",
    "the challenging problem of chiral symmetry breaking is not present here , so this the place to start testing new perturbation expansion .",
    "all masses are expected to be finite in this sector , so we can use any mass as a physical scale in renormalization scheme . the most fundamental and simple quantity is the 2-point function of stress - energy tensor.@xmath187    let us consider the family of poles of pade approximant with quantum numbers of @xmath188 in [ spectralequation ] ( so called vacuum regge trajectory ) : @xmath189    where the function @xmath190 can be obtained perturbatively from above matrix equation for @xmath191 .",
    "we denote the running coupling constant at scale @xmath192 as @xmath193 , assuming that the uv regularization is already removed , so that @xmath179 .",
    "let us look at the structure of the relation for @xmath194 .",
    "there is one important fact in pade theory : it always overestimates the masses .",
    "in other words , at any fixed @xmath126 every mass monotonously decreases with @xmath73 . taking the liberty of assuming that the same property holds in the @xmath123-limit , where @xmath195 remains finite after setting @xmath196 , we conclude that @xmath197 monotonously decreases with scale @xmath198 . in terms of @xmath199-function",
    "this inequality reads:@xmath200    at small @xmath16 this decrease is trivial , as the factor @xmath201 is the fastest changing factor in perturbative region .",
    "the masses of free particles in a box size @xmath16 decrease as @xmath202 when the box grows .",
    "however , we expect that with increase of @xmath16 the growth of effective coupling constant @xmath193 will stop this decrease so that asymptotically at large @xmath16 the masses approach finite limits from above . in that limit",
    "the above inequality turns into equality@xmath203    in terms of function @xmath204 this mean that it goes to @xmath205 as @xmath206 . in order to interpolate between weak and strong coupling regions",
    "let us generalize this formula by applying legendre transform:@xmath207    at any @xmath208 the rhs of above formula goes to @xmath205 as @xmath209 at @xmath182 . on the other hand , at small @xmath210",
    "it also goes to @xmath205 as @xmath211 .",
    "therefore there must be at least one minimum in between . in virtue of the pade theorems about monotonic mass decrease",
    "we may expect that there is only one minimum .",
    "the idea behind the @xmath8 expansion we proposed in the old paper ( @xcite ) is that there is smooth interpolation between perturbative region of small @xmath8 and confining theory at @xmath212 .",
    "the equation for the minimum in [ legendre ] involves the @xmath199-function:@xmath213    as the @xmath199-function starts with @xmath214 with positive @xmath215 we get:@xmath216    so , in general , the legendre transform @xmath217 starts with some constant at @xmath218 then grows , reaches its maximum at some point where @xmath219 , then starts decreasing and reaches the limit at @xmath212 .",
    "this is much smoother behavior than the @xmath16-dependence of original function @xmath220 , which starts at @xmath205 as @xmath221 at small @xmath16 then decreases and reaches the limit at @xmath182 .",
    "this was the purpose of the legendre transform to achieve dimensional transmutation and obtain smoother behavior .",
    "no finite order of perturbation expansion could have reproduced the confining asymptotics at @xmath182 . on the contrary , within the @xmath222-expansion starting with the second order , we can have expected properties : linear growth at small @xmath8 then maximum at finite @xmath8 then descend to another limit at @xmath212 .",
    "the drama was totally eliminated from confinement story by means of this legendre transform .",
    "the first 4 coefficients of @xmath8-expansion for all basic trajectories ( vector , scalar , vacuum ) were computed in my old paper ( @xcite ) . for the operator with @xmath223 extra derivatives@xmath224",
    "the coefficients @xmath225 are proportional to anomalous dimensions in leading order@xmath226\\ ] ]    which is positive for @xmath227 and vanish at @xmath228 in virtue of conservation of energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this means that lowest mass can not be taken as a definition of physical scale in this procedure .",
    "we can take the next one , @xmath229 , use the relation between effective coupling and @xmath8 and compute remaining masses in terms of this particular @xmath8 corresponding to @xmath230 @xmath231    this expansion is constructed so that all terms are universal and calculable , with zeroth term having good resemblance to reality , as we know from the old paper as well as its rebirthing with @xmath183 models .",
    "one may argue that there are infinitely many ways to build such an expansion and we agree with that . but the same can be said about wilson s @xmath10 expansion , which interpolated between @xmath232 and @xmath233 dimensions in the phase transition theory .",
    "there are many ways of analytic continuation into fractional dimension of space , but the most natural one chosen by wilson turned out to work well in practice .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this @xmath8 expansion will be as lucky .",
    "the approach we revived in this paper is opposite to modern quest for string theory solution of large n qcd . instead of finding peculiar string theory equivalent to perturbative qcd in the uv region we postulate existence of such string theory and",
    "are studying its properties without a luxury of some local 2d field theory as a dual definition .",
    "we rather introduce most general free meson theory in 4d with unknown masses and coupling constants to qcd gauge invariant composite fields and derive explicit equations for these masses and coupling constants .",
    "the underlying idea is that perturbative qcd is very close to reality , as the effective coupling constant at hadron scale is small .",
    "it is just the ir divergencies which prevent us from perturbative calculations of mass ratios .",
    "once we regularize the perturbation theory we can expect rapid convergence , because the planar graphs grow only a power of order of perturbation expansion .",
    "renormalons look like a paper tiger : they disappear after regularization . on top of general analytic arguments",
    "there are extra factorials in denominator of our expansion , arising from transformation from perturbative qcd to the mass spectral operator .",
    "the educated reader ( of older generation ) may say : wait a minute , but where are svz vacuum condensates ?",
    "my first answer : they are no longer needed as we do not truncate the perturbation expansion .",
    "we rather argue that this expansion converge .",
    "svz condensates were designed to phenomenologically describe renormalons : high momentum regions in feynman integrals of higher order , behaving as powers of qcd mass scale .",
    "these powerlike terms balanced the decrease of masses as function of @xmath16 and svz obtained good agreement with experiment by matching one - loop qcd with sum of pole terms at the scale determined by the vacuum condensate terms .    on the other hand , in case the svz condensates would be derived and computed from the first principles , there is no problem adding them to the expansion , as they are just another powerlike corrections , which we already considered .",
    "this problem should be solved beyond the scope of planar graphs , at non - perturbative level . the nonperturbative formulation of the large n qcd is given by the loop equation .",
    "my last study of this equation @xcite led to algebraic formulation , with the string position operator @xmath234 playing the role of witten s master field in dual space ( for momentum wilson loop ) and satisfying some nonlinear algebraic relations .",
    "this formulation is suited for the expansion in powers of momenta and it fits the meromorphic structure presented here . our next challenge would be to match these two approaches and obtain mass spectrum equation relating @xmath0 to operator @xmath235 .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that vev s of powers of @xmath234 are somehow related to the svz condensates .",
    "one last word about notorious pade approximation .",
    "i hope the reader understands by now that there are no approximations involved in our theory .",
    "this is regularization rather than approximation .",
    "we impose correct analytic properties and symmetries of large n qcd beyond perturbation theory by first using matrix pade approximation in hilbert space and then taking @xmath123 limit when approximation becomes realistic in a sense that it has all the desired properties including infinite mass spectrum .",
    "one way of viewing this regularization is to say that cft is defined up to terms exponential in momentum in the uv region .",
    "all the powerlike terms come from vev in ope , but possible exponential terms represent nonperturbative effects .",
    "our pade regularization introduces such terms in a unique way , preserving unitarity and analiticity .",
    "so , for any @xmath16 we may declare that the theory is defined beyond perturbation expansion .",
    "the limit @xmath236 brings us back to `` original '' theory whatever it is . in case",
    "there is confinement , the mass spectrum will stay finit at @xmath182 , otherwise it will condense to contimuum of freely flying gluons and quarks .",
    "so , within our formulation , confinement comes about as a result of conformal symmetry breaking by svz condensates of our cft .",
    "recently , my old work was noticed and misinterpreted by several authors .",
    "their conclusion was that there were many phenomenological formulas with poles approximating logarithm , say , @xmath6 function .",
    "i certainly agree with this statement , but it has nothing to do with the theory developed in that work .    there is no systematic treatment of large @xmath73 qcd as a theory of infinite number of free particles with  masses given by poles of @xmath6 functions",
    ". such theory must start in hilbert space to take into acount whole amount of unitarity+ analiticity requirements .",
    "one can not treat various channels separately . as for",
    "the bessel functions , they naturaly arise in zeroth approximation of cft because that this sum of pole terms approaches conformal limit as fast as possible in complex plane ( as exponential of momentum ) .",
    "however , by itself the ratio of bessel functions does not represent any consistent field theory .",
    "it contains artificial cutoff @xmath16 which must tend to infinity after summation of perturbation expansion .",
    "if we limit ourself to the ratio of bessel functions and tend @xmath16 to infinity we recover original cft .",
    "it is only after dimensional transmutation and taking the limit @xmath237 we remove ambiguity of initial approximation and come back to real qcd .",
    "note that conformal symmetry of the leading order was absolutely essential to obtain calculable perturbation expansion .",
    "it is because of conformal symmetry our leading order @xmath0 matrix becomes block - diagonal in space of conformal tensors , so that we can invert it in pade equations .",
    "the conformal group representation of meson states is broken down to general lorentz group representation in the second order in our perturbation expansion .",
    "the interpolation to physical limit when the approximation disappears completely is similar to uv regularization of qed half century ago .",
    "the cutoff enters only in logarithms , effectively renormalizing running coupling constant . by renormalization , using legendre transform , we trade  this cutoff for the effective coupling constant @xmath8 which should be set to @xmath9 in the end .",
    "i no longer hope that anyone will pick this theory and actually carry out these computations of meson spectrum .",
    "i will do my best to finish this work myself .",
    "the terms of this renormalized perturbation expansion are all calculable , and we presented explicit formulas in this paper .",
    "maybe these formulas will convince the authors of recent papers on the subject that soft corrections to cft * do * lead to corrections to mass spectrum : one of the goals of the present paper was to clarify this misunderstanding .",
    "the hardest problem is to compute ordinary planar graphs for 2-point functions with dimensional regularization .",
    "i am aware of 3 and 4 loop calculations , but this may not be enough .",
    "maybe some recent progress in perturbative calculations in susy yang mills theory can help here ?",
