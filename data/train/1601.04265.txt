    "since the pioneering work of heisenberg @xcite , it is understood that ferromagnetism observed in nature is generated by quantum many - body effects of many fermions and the coulomb interaction between electrons .",
    "it is a challenging theoretical problem to confirm this scenario by showing that only short - range hopping of electrons and the spin - independent coulomb interaction can lead to ferromagnetism in the concrete setting of the hubbard model .",
    "see @xcite for early reviews .    there have been a number of rigorous examples of ferromagnetism ( or ferrimagnetism @xcite ) in the hubbard model , and it is clear by now that certain versions of the model do generate ferromagnetism .",
    "important examples include special classes of the hubbard model with a dispersionless band ( flat - band ferromagnetism ) introduced by mielke @xcite and by tasaki @xcite , and some models obtained by modifying the flat - band models @xcite .",
    "the latter examples are of special importance since they provide rigorous examples of itinerant ferromagnetism in many - electron models without any singularities .",
    "a common feature of all these rigorous examples of ferromagnetism is that they describe insulators .",
    "metallic ferromagnetism , in which same electrons contribute both to magnetism and conduction , is clearly more interesting and challenging to understand .",
    "the older example by thouless @xcite and nagaoka @xcite may not be regarded as metallic ferromagnetism since it allows only a single carrier in the whole system .",
    "as far as we know the first rigorous example of metallic ferromagnetism in the hubbard model was presented by tanaka and idogaki @xcite , who treated a quasi one - dimensional model .",
    "see also @xcite for earlier work which employed similar ideas in a different model .",
    "but the physics of one - dimensional electron systems is rather special , and the basic mechanism is captured by the perron - frobenius argument @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite where a class of multi - orbital hubbard models in higher dimensions with restricted hopping is treated .",
    "the same argument never works for models in genuine two and higher dimensions .    in @xcite ,",
    "tanaka and tasaki presented the first rigorous example of metallic ferromagnetism in the hubbard model in two and higher dimensions . in this work ,",
    "a multi - band hubbard model with short - range ( but admittedly complicated ) hoppings was constructed , and it was proved that the ground state of the model exhibits saturated ferromagnetism in the limits where the coulomb interaction @xmath9 and the band gap tend to infinity . in the ground state ,",
    "electrons are supported by the two lowest bands , where the lowest band is half - filled ( which effectively means full - filling for fully polarized states ) and the second lowest band carries less electrons than the half - filling .",
    "the ground state is metallic since the second lowest band can carry conduction .",
    "although the model of @xcite certainly captures some essence of metallic ferromagnetism , it is unsatisfactory in the sense that the ferromagnetism is supported by two bands .",
    "one may interpret that the lowest band is exhibiting ferromagnetism from the mechanism similar to that in the insulating ferromagnets discussed above .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : bands ] .",
    "it is thus desirable to have examples of hubbard models where metallic ferromagnetism takes place only within a single ( conduction ) band .",
    "then we should have ferromagnetism generated by a mechanism intrinsic to metallic systems .",
    "this is the goal of the present study , which we partially achieve .",
    "we shall construct a new class of hubbard model on lattices obtained by decorating closely packed lattices in two or higher dimension ( such as the triangular lattice ) .",
    "the model has short - ranged but somewhat complicated hoppings , and the on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "we shall take the limits where the coulomb interaction @xmath9 and the band gap become infinitely large .",
    "then there remains only a single band with finite energy , on which electrons are supported .",
    "we shall prove that the ground state of the model exhibits ferromagnetism for certain ranges of the electron number .",
    "although we are not able to treat the case where the density of carrier remains nonzero in the infinite volume limit , our result may be regarded as examples of metallic ferromagnetism when the system size is not too large .",
    "the present work is also of interest from technical point of view since we here develop some new techniques for dealing with metallic ferromagnetism .",
    "in particular we shall prove theorems  [ t : f ] and [ t : ft ] about the ferromagnetism in ground states without constructing the ground states explicitly .",
    "this should have clear advantage over the methods in our previous works , where ( fully polarized ) ground states were always constructed explicitly .",
    "the most important argument , which is presented in section  [ s : ft ] , enables us to relate the kinetic energy with the total spin in a many - electron state .    in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on models in dimensions two or higher , and do not discuss one dimensional systems .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .    in section  [ s :",
    "model ] , we shall describe our model in general setting , and state main results about metallic ferromagnetism for the model based on a general @xmath0-dimensional closely packed lattice .",

    "s : tj ] , by following the method developed in our earlier works ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , we show that strong ferromagnetic coupling between electrons in the lowest band is generated .",
    "the rest of the proof employs new techniques developed for the present work . after proving an essential lower bound on the energy in section  [ s : e ] ,",
    "we concentrate on the model based on the triangular lattice , and prove the theorem about saturated ferromagnetism in section  [ s : sft ] , and that about ( not necessarily saturated ) ferromagnetism in section  [ s : ft ] .",
