    "galaxy clusters comprise the largest structures in the universe and the precise knowledge of their mass structures is important for understanding the history of structure formation and to constrain the still unknown types of dark content of the universe .",
    "the clusters are believed to have grown into their present shapes via collisions and mergers of smaller groups and clusters .",
    "if such objects collide under gravitational attraction , a huge amount of energy can possibly be released .",
    "a certain fraction of this energy is expected to heat the intracluster medium ( icm ) , generate nonthermal particles through shock waves , and induce bulk and turbulent gas motions .",
    "earlier simulations have predicted that the gas bulk motion with the speed of a substantial fraction of virial velocity ( @xmath3 ) will persist for several giga years ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if the kinetic velocity of the gas is larger than its sound velocity , nonthermal pressure can not be neglected in estimating the total gravitational mass inside the cluster .",
    "@xcite used numerical simulations to show that the hydrostatic mass estimate is biased low by approximately 520% even in relaxed clusters .",
    "this result can be primarily attributed to an additional pressure support provided by the bulk motions in the icm .",
    "the departure from the hydrostatic assumption is one of the largest sources of systematic uncertainties in cluster cosmology ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the bulk and turbulence gas motions produce doppler shifts in emission lines from heavy irons in the icm and modify the line profiles @xcite .",
    "a line - of - sight velocity of @xmath4 corresponds to a 22  ev shift in the 6.7 kev fe - k line energy .",
    "therefore the doppler - shift measurement requires not only a high energy resolution and a good sensitivity but also a precise instrumental energy - scale calibration .",
    "observational efforts that used x - ray charge - coupled device ( ccd ) detectors with a typical energy resolution of 150  ev have constrained gas motion ( for review , @xcite ) . on the basis of careful assessment of the energy scale of the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; @xcite )",
    "onboard the _ suzaku _ satellite @xcite , @xcite placed an upper limit of @xmath5 on bulk motions in the centaurus cluster and suggested that the cluster mass estimated under the hydrostatic assumption is justified within a factor of 23 .",
    "similar measurements that used xis data have been conducted in several nearby clusters : the upper limit on the bulk motion was derived for the ophiuchus cluster , awm7 , a2319 , the coma cluster , and a3627 @xcite , and possible detection of gas bulk flow in centaurus and a576 was reported by _",
    "thus far , bulk motions has been properly detected in only one cluster : a large radial velocity of a subcluster region relative to the main cluster , @xmath6 , was found in a2256 by _ suzaku _ @xcite .",
    "they suggested that the gas and galaxies are moving together in the cluster potential as a single subcluster .",
    "doppler line broadening has been measured by the reflection grating spectrometer on _ xmm - newton _ , and @xcite obtained a strong upper limit on the turbulent motion ( @xmath7 ) in several objects .",
    "measured the turbulent line broadening for the rgs cluster sample and reported that upper limits generally range between @xmath8 in the 0.8 and 3.4 core regions .",
    "these previous studies demonstrated that the _",
    "suzaku_/xis spectroscopy enables meaningful constraints to be placed on bulk velocity distribution and is complementary to the turbulence measurements by the gratings , which can be performed only at the innermost region .",
    "the number of sample , however , is still insufficient for clarifying the detailed velocity structure of the icm and for understanding the role of kinetic gas motion in the precise cluster mass estimation . in this study , we perform a systematic search for gas bulk motion in nearby clusters by utilizing the _ suzaku _ archive data .",
    "the sample includes eight clusters in the nearby universe that have a wide range of x - ray morphology .",
    "we aim to constrain the presence of gas bulk motions and to determine the dynamical state of clusters by comparing the velocity structure of the icm with that of member galaxies in the optical band .",
    "this study provides an important pilot survey prior to the _ astro - h _",
    "mission @xcite because it ranks the investigation of turbulent and macroscopic gas motions as main objectives of high - resolution spectroscopy @xcite .    throughout this study , we adopt @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "the quoted statistical errors refer to the 68% confidence ranges , unless stated otherwise .",
    "to investigate the icm velocity structure and its possible relationship with the x - ray morphology , the sample was selected to include clusters with cool cores , cold fronts , and subcluster mergers .",
    "the observational features of individual clusters will be mentioned in detail in  [ subsec : velocity_structure ] . because a measurement of the doppler shift of the fe - k emission line requires a good photon statistics , the sample was limited to nearby objects with the 210  kev x - ray flux @xmath12 within the _ suzaku _ data archive . as shown in table  [ tab1 ] , the sample consists of eight nearby clusters including the centaurus and perseus clusters , a2199 , a3667 , a133 , a2029 , a2255 , and a2142 .",

    "following the same manner as in @xcite , @xmath111 is approximated by the emission fraction from an interesting cell . as a result",
    ", the mass correction factor is estimated to be 1.9 , 2.4 for a2029 cell no .  1",
    ", a2255 cell no .  4 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the results indicate that the nonthermal pressure support can not be neglected in some regions of both mergers and relaxed clusters as suggested by the numerical simulations .",
    "these are , however , crude estimations and more accurate information on the spatial velocity structure is required to improve the precision of the mass determination .",
    "the sxs microcalorimeter on board the _ astro - h _ satellite is a non - dispersive spectrometer and enables high - resolution ( 5  ev ) observations in the x - ray regime @xcite .",
    "sxs can measure the doppler shift and broadening of iron lines caused by kinetic gas motions to an accuracy of @xmath115 , which plays an critical role in revealing the dynamics of clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we used the _ suzaku _ satellite to search for gas bulk motion in eight nearby clusters with a variety of x - ray morphologies . from the model fitting to the fe - k line spectra ,",
    "the doppler shift was measured to high accuracy .",
    "the velocity structure of gas was compared with that of member galaxies in the optical band to study the dynamical states of clusters .",
    "this study is also important as a pilot survey for the future high - resolution spectroscopy with the x - ray microcalorimeter onboard _ astro - h_.    in the cores of centaurus and perseus , we confirmed that the bulk velocity does not largely exceed the sound velocity .",
    "for the cen45 subcluster , we found that the upper limit on the icm radial velocity ( @xmath116 ) is significantly smaller than that of galaxies , suggesting that there is an offset between the gas and galaxy distributions along the line of sight due to the subcluster merger .    in the cool - core cluster a2199",
    ", we found a sign of large bulk velocity , however , the significance is not sufficiently high to claim the detection . for two merging clusters with cold fronts , a2142 and a3667 , and a cluster with an irregular cool core , a133 ,",
    "no significant gas motion was detected , yielding the 90% upper limit of @xmath2 .",
    "a sign of large bulk velocity in excess of the xis calibration uncertainty was found in the cool - core cluster a2029 , and in the a2255 subcluster .",
    "we examined the impact of nonthermal pressure support in the cluster mass estimation to find it is not negligible in some regions of both relaxed and merging clusters as predicted by numerical simulations . to improve the significance of the detection ,",
    "however , a further examination by follow - up observations is required .",
    "we expect that upcoming high - resolution observations with _ astro - h _ will determine the icm velocity structure more accurately and will clarify the contribution of nonthermal pressure support in the cluster mass estimation .",
    "we are grateful to the suzaku team members for satellite operation and instrumental calibration .",
    "we also thank the anonymous referee for useful comments .",
