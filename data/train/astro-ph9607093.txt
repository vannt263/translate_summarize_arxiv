    "the question of whether high - redshift galaxies contain interstellar dust has important implications for our interpretation of the fast - growing body of data on the universe at @xmath17 .",
    "dust may redden the spectral energy distribution of galaxies sufficiently to mimic the presence of an old stellar population ( steidel et al .",
    "estimates of star - formation rates from the observed r - band magnitudes  which at @xmath18 sample the rest - frame uv continuum  are highly dependent on extinction corrections ( e.g. ellingson et al . 1996 ) and the transfer of lyman  @xmath0  radiation is radically affected even by trace amounts of dust ( charlot & fall 1993 ; chen & neufeld 1994 ) .",
    "more generally , obscuration by dust in galaxies may give us an increasingly biassed view of the universe with decreasing redshift if the dust , as well as the metal , content of the universe increases with time ( pei & fall 1995 ; fall , charlot , & pei 1996 ) .    studies of damped lyman  @xmath0  systems ( dlas ) in qso spectra offer several tests for the presence of dust .",
    "pei , fall , & bechtold ( 1991 ) found that qsos with damped lyman  @xmath0  systems at @xmath19 tend on average to have slightly redder spectra than those of qsos without dlas ; depending on the shape of the extinction curve , the typical dust - to - gas ratio implied is between 5% and 20% of that in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of our galaxy today .",
    "we have been pursuing a complementary approach which has the advantage of yielding estimates of the dust - to - gas ratio in _ individual _ dlas , rather than an average for a given sample .",
    "the method , which is described in  2 below , is based on the comparison of the relative gas - phase abundances of zn and cr , two elements which in the local ism have different dust depletion properties .",
    "the first results from our survey of these two species were published in pettini et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . in that paper",
    "we reported that the typical dust - to - gas ratio in dlas at @xmath2 is approximately 10% of the local value , although there is considerable scatter .    over the last three years",
    "we have continued our observations of zn and cr in high - redshift galaxies ; the full sample now includes 33 dlas , more than one third of the total number known . in this paper",
    "we reconsider the evidence for dust in damped lyman  @xmath0systems using this enlarged data set , prompted in part by recent claims that damped systems may be dust - free ( prochaska & wolfe 1996 , 1997 ; lu , sargent , & barlow 1997 ) . +",
    "as discussed by pettini , boksenberg , & hunstead ( 1990 ) , in order to use interstellar absorption lines to study the chemical evolution of high - redshift galaxies it is necessary to consider two effects : intrinsic departure from solar relative abundances and selective depletion onto grains .",
    "the ratio of two elements may be different from the value measured in the solar system if the two elements are synthesized in processes which proceed at different rates over the star formation history of a galaxy .",
    "an often quoted example of this is the overabundance by about 0.5 dex of oxygen and the @xmath0-elements relative to iron in metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath20 ) halo stars of the milky way = log(x / y)@xmath21log(x / y)@xmath22 .",
    "o is produced primarily by massive stars which evolve on much shorter timescales than the low - mass progenitors of type ia supernovae thought to be the major source of fe ( e.g. wheeler , sneden , & truran 1989 ) .",
    "the presence of dust will superimpose on such nucleosynthetic differences a depletion pattern reflecting the empirical observation that some elements condense out of the gas phase into solid form more readily than others ( or alternatively , that some elements are not as readily returned to the gas as others when interstellar grains are destroyed in interstellar shocks ) .    in principle",
    "it should be possible to disentangle these two effects , guided by existing information on stellar abundances as a function of metallicity ( e.g. wheeler et al .",
    "1989 ) and on the way element depletion varies in interstellar clouds in our galaxy ( e.g. savage & sembach 1996 )",
    ". it should be borne in mind , however , that : ( i ) the star - formation histories of the galaxies giving rise to damped lyman  @xmath0  systems may differ from that of the milky way at the same look - back time ; and ( ii ) the composition of interstellar dust may also be different in these young galaxies .",
    "on the basis of these considerations pettini et al .",
    "( 1990 ) proposed that zn and cr are a pair of elements well suited to measuring both metal enrichment and dust depletion in damped lyman  @xmath0  galaxies .",
    "observations summarised by sneden , gratton , & crocker ( 1991 ) show that in galactic stars [ zn / fe ] @xmath23 , with little scatter ( @xmath24  dex ) over the range [ fe / h ] @xmath25 to @xmath26 . in large magellanic cloud stars [ zn / fe ] @xmath27 ( russell & dopita 1992 ) .",
    "evidently , the productions of fe and zn are closely linked and their relative abundances are , at least to first order , independent of metallicity , past star - formation history , and galaxy mass . while it is true that the reasons for such tight correspondence are not yet understood , this is more likely to be an indication of the inadequacies of current theoretical supernova yields rather than an indictment of the data ( malaney & chaboyer 1996 ) .",
    "the production of cr also follows closely that of fe , since [ cr / fe ] @xmath9 from [ fe / h ] = 0 to @xmath28 . however , two recent surveys of extremely metal - poor stars by mcwilliam et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and ryan , norris , & beers ( 1996 ) both show that for [ fe / h ] @xmath29 [ cr / fe ] _ decreases _ significantly ( and with considerable scatter ) .",
    "apparently , the yield of cr is reduced in the very low abundance regime , possibly reflecting a shift to higher mass numbers in iron - peak nucleosynthesis ( mcwilliam et al .",
    "1995 ) .    in the interstellar medium of the milky way zn and cr",
    "have very different dust depletion properties ( see fig . 2 of savage & sembach 1996 ) .",
    "zn is at most only lightly depleted and is present in near - solar proportions in warm disk clouds and along sight - lines where the molecular fraction is low .",
    "cr , on the other hand , is among the most depleted elements ; typically between @xmath3090% and @xmath3099% of the cr is in solid form .",
    "based on what is known on the relative abundances of zn and cr in stars and the ism of our galaxy , we conclude that :    \\1 ) the zn / h ratio in damped lyman  @xmath0  systems is a measure of the degree of metal enrichment , analogous to the [ fe / h ] scale on which galactic chemical evolution is normally reckoned ; and    \\2 ) for [ zn / h ] @xmath31 , departures from the solar value of the cr / zn ratio are most naturally interpreted as being due to depletion of cr onto grains . by inference ,",
    "the cr / zn ratio can be used to test for the presence of interstellar dust in high redshift galaxies .",
    "the full data set consists of intermediate dispersion spectra of 33 damped lyman  @xmath0  systems covering the zn  ii @xmath32 and cr  ii @xmath33 resonance lines at absorption redshifts ranging from @xmath34 = 0.692 to 3.390 ; 25 systems were observed by us , 8 others are from the literature .",
    "this sample constitutes a significant fraction of the total number of damped systems known : the latest compilation by wolfe et al .",
    "( 1995 ) lists 80 confirmed dlas .",
    "our observations used the william herschel telescope on la palma , canary islands , and the anglo - australian telescope at siding spring observatory , australia .",
    "the spectra are presented in separate papers ( pettini et al .",
    "1994,1997 ) , together with details of the data acquisition and reduction .    in table 1",
    "we have collected the measurements of relevance to the determination of the dust content of dlas , including absorption redshift , neutral hydrogen column density @xmath35(h  i ) , [ zn / h ] , and [ cr / zn ] . in approximately half of the cases the zn  ii and cr  ii lines are below the detection limit of our data ( typically @xmath36(3@xmath37 ) = 25  m , where @xmath36(3@xmath37 ) is the 3@xmath37 limit for the rest - frame equivalent width of an unresolved absorption line ) , and [ cr / zn ] is therefore undetermined . in total",
    ", we have been able to measure [ cr / zn ] ( or place a useful limit on this ratio ) for 18 dlas .",
    "all the abundances listed in table 1 were derived using the experimental determinations of the @xmath38-values of the zn  ii and cr  ii multiplets by bergeson & lawler ( 1993 ) and the solar system abundances of zn and cr from the compilation by anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) ; log  ( cr / h)@xmath39 . ] .",
    "consequently , for damped systems in common , the values of [ zn / h ] and [ cr / zn ] in table 1 differ by @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively from those listed in table 3 of pettini et al .",
    "( 1994 ) which were based on earlier , theoretical estimates of the @xmath38-values and slightly different solar abundances .",
    "the change , particularly to [ cr / zn ] , is significant and emphasises the importance of accurate measurements of the atomic parameters of these key transitions .    in figure 1",
    "the values of [ cr / zn ] measured in 18 damped lyman  @xmath0  systems ( filled circles ) are plotted against the metallicity [ zn / h ] .",
    "the open circles are values typical of warm interstellar clouds in the disk and halo of the milky way from the recent review by savage & sembach ( 1996 ) . for halo clouds",
    "s was taken as a proxy for zn since few observations of the latter are available ; this is a reasonable assumption given that both s and zn are undepleted in warm interstellar clouds ( savage & sembach 1996 ) .",
    "we have also reproduced in the figure the variation of [ cr / fe ] with [ fe / h ] in galactic stars ; the dotted lines correspond to the upper and lower quartiles of the large sample of stars considered by ryan et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows that there is a spread in the values of [ cr / zn ] in damped lyman  @xmath0  systems . in some cases [ cr / zn ]",
    "is in good agreement with the relative abundances measured in stars which , over the range of metallicities considered here , do not differ much from the solar ratio .",
    "in many damped systems , however , [ cr / zn ] is lower than solar and comparable to values seen in local halo clouds .",
    "inspection of figure 1 and column ( 5 ) of table 1 suggests that the range of [ cr / zn ] encountered is larger than the random scatter expected from measurement errors ; the largest and smallest value in the sample differ by more than @xmath42 .    a straightforward average of our measurements of @xmath35(cr@xmath43)/@xmath35(zn@xmath43 )",
    "yields a mean @xmath44[cr / zn]@xmath45  ( @xmath46 limits ) .",
    "we interpret this result as an indication that in damped lyman  @xmath0  systems about half of the cr is typically locked up in grains .",
    "as already noted by pettini et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , the degree of cr depletion in damped lyman  @xmath0  systems is lower than that normally observed in interstellar clouds in the solar vicinity .",
    "however , it does not necessarily follow that the composition of interstellar dust in these high - redshift galaxies is _ qualitatively _ different from that in the local ism , and is peculiarly deficient in cr .",
    "generally , other refractory elements also show reduced depletions in dlas ( e.g. meyer & roth 1990 ) ; the most extensive data set available is for fe and indeed [ cr / fe ] @xmath9 in 9 dlas",
    "( lu et al . 1997 ) .",
    "of course we can not exclude the possibility that there may be real differences in the detailed composition of interstellar dust grains in damped lyman  @xmath0  systems as compared with the ism of the milky way ; indeed , this may be an interesting topic to be addressed in future with more precise determinations of the relative abundances of different grain constituents than are available at present .",
    "however , the most straightforward interpretation of the existing data is that , to a first approximation , _ most _ refractory elements are only half - depleted in the ism of the high-@xmath16 galaxies giving rise to damped lyman  @xmath0  systems .",
    "another way of expressing this result is that the _ dust - to - metals _ ratio in the dlas is approximately half of that in the galaxy .    while a detailed treatment is beyond the scope of this paper , this finding may not be difficult to explain",
    ". there are at least three reasons why we may expect a lower overall level of heavy element depletion :    \\1 ) damped systems are generally metal - poor and the efficiency with which refractory elements condense into solid form may well vary non - linearly with the overall abundance of the grain constituents .",
    "\\2 ) grain destruction by interstellar shocks is likely to be more effective at higher temperatures , as evidenced by the lower depletions in local warm interstellar clouds , compared with cooler regions of the ism ( savage & sembach 1996 ) . at the low metallicities of the damped lyman  @xmath0  galaxies , it is likely that there is no cool phase of the ism ( e.g. hartquist & dyson 1984 ) .",
    "\\3 ) it has been suggested that the reduced depletions in the halo , which for cr approach the values we measure in dlas ( see figure 1 ) , result from more frequent grain processing through supernova - induced shocks ( savage & sembach 1996 and references therein ) . with typical star - formation rates of 8.5  @xmath47  yr@xmath6 ( steidel et al .",
    "1996a ) the supernova rate in galaxies producing dlas is likely to be one order of magnitude higher than that of the milky way today .",
    "pettini et al .",
    "( 1997 ) derive a column density - weighted mean metallicity @xmath44[zn / h]@xmath48 for the present sample of 33 dlas ( individual values of [ zn / h ] range over nearly @xmath49 dex about this mean value ) .",
    "consequently , the heavy elements which make up interstellar dust are , on average , only @xmath8 as abundant as in the present - day ism .",
    "if we further assume that half of the grain constituents are in the gas - phase , as suggested by our cr and zn observations , we conclude that the `` typical '' dust - to - gas ratio in damped lyman  @xmath0  systems is @xmath14 of that found in the interstellar medium of our galaxy",
    ". this fraction may be an underestimate by a factor of @xmath11 if o , which accounts for about half of the mass in grains , is _ overabundant _ by a factor of @xmath50 relative to zn , as is the case in galactic stars with [ zn / h ] @xmath51 .",
    "this estimate of the dust - to - gas ratio is 3 times lower than that derived by pettini et al .",
    "the change is _ not _ due to the increased sample of dlas , but mostly stems from the new @xmath38-values for the zn  ii and cr  ii transitions adopted in the present analysis , as explained in  3 above . given the uncertainties and the dispersion among different damped systems , we consider the new value of the `` typical '' dust - to - gas ratio still to be consistent with the range of values ( between @xmath52 and @xmath53 times lower than the local ism ) deduced by pei et al .",
    "( 1991 ) on the basis of the mild reddening they found in qsos with damped lyman  @xmath0  systems .      in the disk of our galaxy , @xmath54(h  i)@xmath55  @xmath56  mag@xmath6 ( diplas & savage 1994 ) , where @xmath57 is the extinction ( in magnitudes ) in the @xmath58 band .",
    "for the typical damped lyman  @xmath0  system with neutral hydrogen column density @xmath35(h  i ) = @xmath59  @xmath56 , we therefore expect a trifling @xmath60  mag in the rest - frame @xmath58-band .",
    "of more interest is the far - uv extinction , since this is the spectral region observed at optical wavelengths at the redshifts of interest here ( @xmath61 ) . adopting the smc extinction curve ( bouchet et al .",
    "1985)which may be the appropriate one to use at the low metallicities of most dlas  we calculate that a damped lyman  @xmath0  system will typically introduce an extinction at 1500    of @xmath62  mag in the spectrum of a background qso .",
    "such a small degree of obscuration is consistent with the models of pei & fall ( 1995 ) and fall , charlot , & pei ( 1996 ) which assume the same dust - to - metals ratio as found here . in these models dust in galaxies at @xmath63 introduces a significant bias in magnitude - limited qso samples , but at @xmath61 the effect is small .",
    "the field galaxies at @xmath64 now being identified routinely by means of deep lyman limit imaging ( steidel et al .",
    "1996a , b ) exhibit absorption spectra very similar to those of damped lyman  @xmath0  systems , as was indeed expected . in estimating the reddening of the stellar spectral energy distribution",
    ", it is more appropriate to apply the extinction law for starburst galaxies determined by calzetti , kinney , & storchi - bergmann ( 1994 ) . in this case , @xmath35(h  i ) = @xmath59  @xmath56 would produce @xmath65  mag .",
    "thus , _ if _ the dust - to - gas ratio of damped lyman  @xmath0  systems applies to the star - forming regions found by deep imaging , the spectral energy distributions of these objects are not significantly reddened by dust , irrespective of the details of the extinction curve .",
    "however , even such a small amount of dust would result in considerable quenching of lyman  @xmath0  emission , given the large optical depths involved ( e.g. hartmann et al . 1988 ) .    while the above considerations are of some interest , it is important not to lose sight of the approximate nature of our estimate of the abundance of dust . given the range of values of [ cr / zn ] in figure 1 and the spread by @xmath66 orders of magnitude in [ zn / h ] at @xmath19 found by pettini et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1997 ) , the concept of a `` typical '' dust - to - gas ratio is questionable .",
    "rather , the observations suggest that some sight - lines through high - redshift galaxies may be essentially dust - free , while others could suffer detectable extinction .    finally , a dust - to - gas ratio 30 times lower than that of the milky way implies that a @xmath67 galaxy with a mass of @xmath68 will contain @xmath69 of dust . at @xmath61 , thermal emission from such quantities of dust",
    "may be detectable between 850 and 450 @xmath70 m with scuba , the new sub - millimeter array camera on the james clerk maxwell telescope on mauna kea , _ if _ the dust temperature is greater than 60  k. +",
    "recent analyses of echelle observations of damped lyman  @xmath0  systems with the hires spectrograph on the keck telescope ( prochaska & wolfe 1996 , 1997 ; lu et al .",
    "1997 ) have concluded that there is _ no _ evidence for dust depletion in these galaxies and have questioned the validity of the method outlined here  based on the [ cr / zn ] ratio  as a test for the presence of dust at high redshift . as a logical extension of this reasoning , lu et al .",
    "further suggest that the well - documented lack of variation of [ zn / fe ] with [ fe / h ] in galactic stars may be misleading .",
    "it is important to realise at the outset that these authors conclusions are _ not _ based on improved measures of the zn and cr abundances made possible by the powerful combination of hires and the keck telescope ; in all cases in common there is good agreement with the 4-m observations reported by pettini et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1997 ) .",
    "rather , there are significant differences in the interpretation of the common body of data . as we shall now show , the observations by prochaska & wolfe and by lu et al .",
    "are in fact entirely consistent with the overall picture proposed here , whereby : ( i ) dust ( and metals ) are much less abundant in high - redshift galaxies than in the local ism ; ( ii ) the `` typical '' dust - to - gas ratio is @xmath14 of that of diffuse interstellar clouds in the milky way , but with considerable spread between different sight - lines ; ( iii ) no exotic composition of interstellar grains is required , only an overall reduction in the proportion of heavy elements locked up in solid form .    before proceeding further ,",
    "it is worth considering whether this is a useful discussion ; after all , could it not be argued that a dust abundance as low as 1/30 of today s is , at least to a first approximation , equivalent to no dust at all ?",
    "in reality , the qualitative difference between these two possibilities has important consequences :    \\a ) if all damped lyman  @xmath0  systems were dust - free , as has been proposed , this would be a major difference between galaxies at high redshift and those in the nearby universe , where dust is a ubiquitous component of the ism .",
    "\\b ) even small amounts of dust have a profound effect on the transfer of lyman  @xmath0  radiation , and will alter to some extent our view of the distant universe if they give rise to a redshift dependent bias , as emphasised by fall and collaborators ( see references cited above ) .",
    "\\c ) even greatly reduced depletions of grain constituents may alter relative element abundances by factors which are comparable to those resulting from nucleosynthesis effects .",
    "intrinsic departures from solar ratios seen in galactic stars of different metallicities amount in many cases to factors of less than @xmath50 ; without taking into account properly the effects of dust depletion , we may be misled in our attempts to interpret the clues provided by non - solar element ratios .",
    "the assertion by prochaska & wolfe and by lu et al . that the pattern of element abundances seen in high-@xmath16 damped lyman  @xmath0  systems is _ inconsistent _ with dust depletions is based on two main lines of evidence :      \\2 ) some element ratios exhibit departures from solar values which are consistent with nucleosynthesis by type ii supernovae and apparently admit no additional contribution from selective grain depletions .      [ [ lack - of - a - correlation - between - depletion - and - condensation - temperature ] ] lack of a correlation between depletion and condensation temperature ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    comparisons with the local pattern of element depletions are normally made with reference to the line of sight to @xmath71  oph ; the large depletions of refractory elements in the cool cloud in front of this star indeed highlight a trend of decreasing gas - phase abundance with increasing condensation temperature  see figure 5 of savage & sembach ( 1996 ) .",
    "so , for example , ti is more depleted than fe and cr which in turn are more depleted than mn ; the measured gas - phase abundances [ ti / h ] @xmath72 , [ fe / h ] @xmath73 , [ cr / h ] @xmath74 , and [ mn / h ] @xmath75 imply that @xmath76% of the ti , @xmath77% of the fe and cr , and @xmath7896% of the mn are in solid form .",
    "however , what has been overlooked is the fact that , at the reduced dust depletions prevailing in damped lyman  @xmath0  systems , such a pattern would be largely washed out .",
    "consider what happens if half of the interstellar grains are destroyed , as we have proposed is the case in the `` typical '' dla .",
    "then the gas - phase abundances of ti , fe , cr and mn are _ all _ increased to @xmath7850% and all 4 elements would be found to be depleted by approximately the same amount to within a few percent .",
    "( such a dilution of the pattern of relative depletions can be seen directly in warm interstellar clouds in the halo of the milky way , which show lower overall depletions than cool disk clouds  see figure 6 of savage & sembach 1996 ) .",
    "superimposed on this uniform degree of depletion we may then find intrinsic departures from solar ratios resulting from differences in the nucleosynthetic origin of some elements .",
    "thus [ mn / fe ] @xmath79 in dlas with [ fe / h ] @xmath80 to @xmath81 ( lu et al .",
    "1997 ) , as is the case in galactic stars of this metallicity ( ryan et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the fact that refractory elements exhibit reduced depletions in dlas has been apparent from the earliest studies of this kind ( e.g. meyer , welty , & york 1989 ; pettini et al .",
    "1990 ) and is indeed evident in the keck data ; the mistake is in assuming that the same relative gas - phase abundances which result when nearly 100% of these elements are locked up in grains , and only tiny fractions remain in gaseous form , are maintained when the overall degree of depletion is reduced to only @xmath13 .",
    "lu et al . have proposed that the [ mn / fe ] ratio can be used to discriminate between dust depletion and intrinsic differences due to nucleosynthesis because mn is less depleted than fe in cool interstellar clouds and more deficient than fe in metal - poor stars . in view of the discussion above , however , we now see that this reasoning no longer holds at low overall levels of depletion .",
    "rather , the fact that the [ mn / fe ] ratio responds to _ both _ effects makes it less suitable for disentangling one from the other .",
    "a more straightforward test for the presence of dust is provided by the ratios of elements which are _ not _ sensitive to the nucleosynthetic history of the gas , such as cr , ni , and fe relative to zn .",
    "similarly , clues to the nucleosynthesis of damped lyman  @xmath0  systems are best deduced from elements which are not easily depleted onto grains but have relative abundances which do vary with metallicity , such as zn and s.    [ [ nucleosynthesis - by - type - ii - supernovae - as - the - sole - reason - for - non - solar - element - ratios ] ] nucleosynthesis by type ii supernovae as the sole reason for non - solar element ratios ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    we now consider the second point .",
    "argue that the [ n / o ] and [ s / fe ] ratios are inconsistent with dust depletions because they exhibit the same values as in galactic metal - poor stars .",
    "but , as dicussed by pettini , lipman & hunstead 1995 and in more detail by lipman ( 1995 ) , the [ n / o ] ratio is more sensitive than most to the past history of star formation in a galaxy .",
    "for this reason , and given the uncertainties in the relative importance of primary and secondary production of n at low metallicities , [ n / o ] is not a useful tracer of dust .",
    "turning to [ s / fe ] , lu et al .",
    "find [ s / fe ] @xmath82 , in line with the well - known overabundance of the @xmath0-elements at low metallicities ; depletion of fe onto grains , if present , would have been expected to increase this ratio further .",
    "the problem here is that s has been measured in only _ three _ dlas in total , two of which ( q0000@xmath21263 and q2348@xmath21148 ) are among the most metal - deficient known , with [ s / h ] @xmath28 ( see figure 23 and table 16 of lu et al . ) .",
    "zn has not been detected in either of these two systems , so we can not test directly for the presence of dust .",
    "it is quite conceivable ( see figure 1 ) that these extremely metal - poor systems are indeed dust - free .",
    "however , on the basis of the large dispersion in [ cr / zn ] evident in our sample of 18 dlas , we see little justification for extending this conclusion to _ all _ other damped lyman  @xmath0  systems .",
    "in galactic stars [ s / zn ] @xmath83 when [ zn / h ] = [ fe / h ] @xmath84 .",
    "if future observations were to show that [ s / zn ] @xmath9 in dlas  as is the case in the _ one _ system where both species have been measured to date , at @xmath85 in q0528@xmath21250would this be conclusive proof that zn is in some way `` anomalous '' and , by inference , that dlas contain no dust , as reasoned by lu et al . ?",
    "not necessarily .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the star - formation history of some high-@xmath16 galaxies may be different from that of the milky way .",
    "the overabundance of the @xmath0-elements in metal - poor halo stars is thought to be the result of the time lag between type ii and type ia supernovae in _ continuous _ star - formation models .",
    "when star formation proceeds in bursts , however , different values of [ @xmath0/fe ] can ensue , as emphasized by gilmore & wyse ( 1991 ) . in the magellanic clouds , for example ,",
    "o is _ less _ abundant than fe ( russell & dopita 1992 ) . as kennicutt ( 1995 )",
    "has shown , galaxies in the local group have undergone widely different star - formation histories ; it is likely that this is also the case for the galaxies giving rise to damped lyman  @xmath0  systems .    in conclusion ,",
    "the range of values of the [ cr / zn ] ratio we have measured in 18 damped lyman  @xmath0  systems has led us to conclude that dust is present in at least some high - redshift galaxies , although always in lower concentrations than in the milky way ism .",
    "we find no conflict between this result and recently published keck observations . unless the depletions of refractory elements are properly taken into account , it will be difficult to use relative element abundances to unravel the nucleosynthetic history of galaxies at high redshifts .",

    "<S> measurements of zn and cr abundances in 18 damped lyman  @xmath0  systems ( dlas ) at absorption redshifts @xmath1 ( but mostly between @xmath2 and 3 ) show that metals and dust are much less abundant in high redshift galaxies than in the milky way today . </S>",
    "<S> typically , [ zn / h ] @xmath3 ; as zn tracks fe closely in galactic stars of all metallicities and is only lightly depleted onto interstellar grains , we conclude that the overall degree of metal enrichment of damped lyman  @xmath0galaxies @xmath4  gyr ago ( @xmath5  km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6 , @xmath7 ) was @xmath8 solar .    </S>",
    "<S> values of [ cr / zn ] span the range from @xmath9 to @xmath10 which we interpret as evidence for selective depletion of cr onto dust in some dlas . on average cr and other refractory elements </S>",
    "<S> are depleted by only a factor of @xmath11 , significantly less than in local interstellar clouds . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that this reflects an overall lower abundance of dust  which may be related to the lower metallicities , likely higher temperature of the ism , and higher supernova rates in these young galaxies  rather than an `` exotic '' composition of dust grains .    combining a metallicity @xmath12 with a dust - to - metals ratio @xmath13 of that in local interstellar clouds </S>",
    "<S> , we deduce that the `` typical '' dust - to - gas ratio in damped lyman  @xmath0   galaxies is @xmath14 of the milky way value . </S>",
    "<S> this amount of dust will introduce an extinction at 1500   of only @xmath15 in the spectra of background qsos . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , we expect little reddening of the broad spectral energy distribution of the high-@xmath16 field galaxies now being found routinely by deep imaging surveys . </S>",
    "<S> even such trace amounts of dust , however , can explain the weakness of lyman  @xmath0  emission from star - forming regions . </S>",
    "<S> we stress the approximate nature of such general statements ; in reality , the range of metallicities and dust depletions encountered indicates that some sight - lines through high - redshift galaxies may be essentially dust - free , while others could suffer detectable extinction .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that , despite claims to the contrary , these conclusions are _ not _ inconsistent with recent high resolution observations of dlas with the keck telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that the star - formation histories of high-@xmath16 galaxies are not necessarily the same as that of the milky way and that , if depletions of some elements onto dust are not taken into account correctly , it is possible to misinterpret the clues to early nucleosynthesis provided by non - solar element ratios . </S>"
