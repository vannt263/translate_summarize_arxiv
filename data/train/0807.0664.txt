    "particles moving to new positions change the structure and allow the system to become `` older '' .",
    "thus , we conjecture that the small , unusually mobile particles are a key component of the aging process , and perhaps facilitate other , more subtle structural changes of the slower moving large particles @xcite .",

    ", we can not use the lack of crystallization to define @xmath19 as our binary sample does not crystallize at any volume fraction .",

    "this allows us to track @xmath26 particles in three dimensions over the course of the experiment @xcite .    to study aging ,",
    "we first must initialize aging in the sample .",
    "there are two approaches to initialization in any glassy system @xcite .",
    "the first is to quench a sample from a liquid state . in a conventional glass",
    ", this is done by rapidly lowering the temperature or increasing the pressure . in a hard sphere or colloidal glass , this would be done by starting with a sample with a volume fraction @xmath27 and then rapidly increase the volume fraction to above @xmath28 .",
    "currently , there is no experimental technique that allows for this method in a sample of hard pmma colloids .",
    "the second method for initializing aging involves shear rejuvenation : by applying a large shear to a system ( above any yield stress ) , in some cases the aging appears to be reinitialized .",
    "this is the method used in this study and previous studies on aging with colloids @xcite .",
    "there are questions as to whether these two methods lead to the same glass @xcite , but for our current study , we stress that only the second of these methods is experimentally available .",
    "experimentally , this leads to a reproducible initial state @xcite and the dynamics appear similar to a conventional glass aging via a rapid quench from a liquid state , as will be shown below .",
    "to shear rejuvenate the sample , we begin each experiment by pulling a small metal wire that is present in the samples with a hand held magnet , thus shear melting the glass and re - initializing the aging process .",
    "we begin taking data , and thus define our initial time @xmath29 , within 20  s after we finish pulling the wire . in practice ,",
    "transient flows continue for a few seconds after cessation of the stirring , and these flows likely still shear the glass , resulting in some uncertainty of the initial time .",
    "however , the 20  s delay between ending the stirring and starting the data acquisition is long enough to allow for these flows to decrease quite significantly , and we see no signs of shearing even at the start of data acquisition .",
    "thus there is at most an uncertainty of 20  s for our choice of @xmath30 , and in practice the results shown in this work are for time scales much longer than 20  s.",
    "the five curves represent five different ages of the sample .",

    "the mean square displacements are normalized relative to each particle size , that is , for the small particles we plot @xmath33 and for the large particles we plot @xmath34.,width=264 ]    aging in glasses is defined as the dependence of the dynamical properties of the system on the time elapsed since vitrification . to quantify these changing dynamics",
    ", we calculate the mean squared displacement ( msd ) , defining displacements @xmath35 , and the msd as @xmath36 .",
    "the angle brackets indicate an average over all particles @xmath37 ( of a given particle size ) , and over all times @xmath38 ; the msd is thus a function of the lag time @xmath39 . in practice , we wish to understand the @xmath38 dependence of the msd as well . thus , while we continuously take data for 1.5  h , we divide the data into five temporal windows , and calculate the msd restricting the average over times @xmath38 within each window .",
    "the windows are formed logarithmically based on the sample age @xmath40 and each temporal window is characterized by its geometric mean age @xmath41 ; see table  [ table1 ] for details . for each window ,",
    "the msd is calculated for lag times @xmath39 up to @xmath42 , and it is important to recognize that for the largest lag times in each window , the data are aging during the observation window . thus , care must be taken in interpreting the msd curves .",

    "figure  [ msd ] shows the msds of the glass over a total period of 1.5 h for the large and small particles . at short time",
    "scales , the motion of a particle is expected to be diffusive as each particle explores its local environment without noticing its neighbors . however , at these high densities , particles are crowded , and this diffusive regime can only be observed on time scales shorter than our image acquisition rate and is therefore not visible in fig .",
    "[ msd ] . instead",
    ", we observe a plateau for most of our time scales , indicating that a particle s motion is slower and more inhibited than normal diffusion .",

    "[ msd ] would need to be rescaled by the diffusion time scale for each particle , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the solvent viscosity , @xmath53 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath54 is the absolute temperature .",
    "@xmath55 thus depends sensitively on particle radius @xmath56 , and the ratio of diffusion time scales for our particle sizes is @xmath57 .",
    "however , in our data , clearly the upturns in the msd curves occur at quite similar time scales ( fig .",
    "[ msd ] ) , rather than differing by an order of magnitude .",
    "these essentially similar upturns indicate the system has a single time scale for structural rearrangements of both species , and this time scale grows as the sample ages . as noted in sec .",
    "[ methods ] , this is perhaps reasonable for a binary colloidal mixture but stands in contrast to mixtures of polymers with differing glass transition temperatures @xcite .",
    "in fact , it suggests that in our experiment the relevant time scale determining structural rearrangements is @xmath48 ( which is the same for both species ) and not the diffusion time scale @xmath55 ( which differs by a factor of 12 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ msd ] we nondimensionalized @xmath58 to better compare the behavior of large and small colloids .",

    "these studies found that binary suspensions have lower viscosities and faster microscopic motion compared to monodisperse samples of equal total volume fraction .",
