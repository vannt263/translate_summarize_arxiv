    "violation of the bell inequality is an unmistakable signature of non - locality for any quantum system .",
    "this has been tested extensively and spectacularly in two qubit systems . yet",
    "the formulation , though general enough to be applied to any bipartite quantum system , throws open the question of whether there could be non - local states which do _ not _ violate the bell inequality . a definitive answer to this , in the negative , is available only for two qubit systems @xcite.the question remains to be settled for @xmath0 systems .    in an attempt to resolve this issue ,",
    "two new formulations of non - locality have been proposed by kaszlikowski et al @xcite and collins et al @xcite ( see @xcite for a general formulation , @xcite for discussions of special cases ) .",
    "the formulations are equivalent and involve new inequalities which , of course , reduce to the standard bell - chsh form for two qubits . remarkably , the inequalities  unlike in the bell case  are dimension dependent , and are not constrained by the cirelson bound @xcite . when applied to the fully entangled states and their contamination by white noise , shown below , @xmath1 one",
    "is led to conclude that non - locality gets stronger with increasing dimensions , and that one can identify non - local states that evade the bell analysis .",
    "the new inequalities are also verified experimentally @xcite , the last one involving coupled systems upto @xmath2 .",
    "thus the new inequalities hold the promise of generalising and subsuming the standard bell analysis for identifying and characterising non - local states in higher dimensions .",
    "it is , therefore , an opportune moment to examine , in a greater detail , the domain of applicability of the new inequalities . for ,",
    "as mentioned , the new inequalities and their experimental tests have been applied only on the states described by eq .",
    "[ eq : wer ] .",
    "this paper undertakes the task , for the specific case of two coupled 4-level systems , and examines whether the new inequalities are more discriminating of non - local states vis - a - vis the bell - chsh , or simply bell , inequality . in this exercise ,",
    "we consider the inequality proposed in @xcite , which we shall call as cglmp , after the authors , and apply them on bell states , i.e. , those that violate bell inequality maximally .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we describe the cglmp inequality briefly , after mentioning the standard bell inequality .",
    "consider an @xmath3 level system with two subsystems @xmath4 of @xmath5 levels .",
    "the bell operator @xmath6 is defined by , @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are local observables for the two subsystems , subject to the conditions @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "local hidden variables models constrain the bell function to obey the inequality @xmath12 a violation of which implies non - locality . as a non - local theory , quantum mechanics pushes the upper bound to a value @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this bound is absolute and independent of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "cglmp inequality has a more complicated structure .",
    "the analog of the bell operator is the function @xmath16 , defined for an @xmath0 level system by    @xmath17 - 1 } \\big(1- \\frac{2k}{n-1}\\big ) \\ { & [ p(a_1 = b_1 + k ) + p(b_1 = a_2 + k+1 ) + p(a_2 = b_2 + k ) + p(b_2 = a_1 + k ) ] \\nonumber \\\\ & - [ p(a_1 = b_1 -k -1 ) + p(b_1 = a_2 -k ) + p(a_2 = b_2 -k -1 ) + p(b_2 = a_1 -k -1 ) ] \\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 are joint measurement probabilities for local observables @xmath19 belonging to the two subsystems .",
    "all the observables have integer eigenvalues @xmath20 .",
    "the measurement prescription can be found in @xcite , and involves two local observers , alice and bob , who fine tune variable phases @xmath21 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : basis ] ) of the states in their respective subsystems , depending on the measurements they wish to perform .",
    "the measurement bases for the observables @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; @xmath24 are of the form @xmath25 rules of classical probability impose the constraint @xmath26 .",
    "this constraint is interpreted as a locality condition inasmuch as it arises in measurements involving joint probabilities .",
    "on evaluating @xmath16 for the maximally entangled state , it is found that the maximum value of @xmath16 as allowed by quantum theory transcends the cirelson bound when @xmath27 .",
    "it takes a value 2.8962 when @xmath28 , and approaches the limiting value of 2.9696 as @xmath29 . since @xmath30 for the bell state",
    ", it follows that some noisy states ( defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : wer ] ) , will obey bell inequality but violate cglmp , buttressing the claim that cglmp prescription is more general and stronger than the bell prescription .",
    "as remarked , experiments are also performed on maximally entangled states .",
    "we wish to contrast the cglmp inequality with the bell formulation for a broader class of states for a @xmath31 level system . in this",
    ", we freely exploit the abundance of bell states which are not restricted to be fully entangled , or even pure .",
    "we follow the analysis in @xcite closely in the construction of bell states .",
    "it is known that the conditions on the local observables for attaining the cirelson bound are given by @xcite @xmath32 the two conditions jointly constitute the definition of clifford algebra , the representations of which are essentially given by the standard pauli matrices or their direct sums for each pair of observables .",
    "it follows thereof that maximally non - local bell states are either coherent , or incoherent superpositions of bell states in mutually orthogonal @xmath33 sectors .",
    "this is a consequence of jordan s theorem @xcite .",
    "this explains why there are no fully entangled bell states when @xmath15 is odd .",
    "armed with this result we conveniently choose the observables to be @xmath34 where the @xmath35 generators ( the @xmath36 matrices ) are taken in their standard form .",
    "the spectrum of the bell operator is easily determined .",
    "it has the eigen - resolution @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "the bases for @xmath39 may be chosen to be @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively . within each sector , all states , both pure and mixed , violate the bell inequality maximally .",
    "thus , in contrast to the two qubit case , bell states can have ranks ranging from @xmath42 .",
    "we consider states belonging to @xmath43 henceforth . we examine the pure and mixed states separately in the next section .",
    "the comparison requires a numerical study of the behaviour of @xmath44 .",
    "it is convenient to represent a pure bell state in the form @xmath45 with the parametrisation @xmath46 the states constitute a six dimensional manifold @xmath47 .",
    "the task consists of optimising the tunable phases @xmath21 ( eq .  [ eq : basis ] ) in order to maximise @xmath44 .",
    "for instance , numerical simulations performed in @xcite determine the optimal values for the maximally entangled state @xmath48 to be @xmath49.this configuration yields a value of @xmath50 , which is in excess of @xmath13 .      in",
    "order find the maximum @xmath44 value for each state , we implement the nelder - mead optimization technique @xcite , to search over the 4-dimensional phase parameter space spanned by @xmath51 .",
    "the same technique was used in @xcite to optimise the parameters for the fully entangled state .",
    "this method does not always guarantee convergence ; the search stops when the ` standard error ' falls under a certain pre - defined value : @xmath52 .",
    "its success depends on the simplex not becoming too small in relation to the curvature of the surface .",
    "if the simplex is too small , chances of it being trapped in a local maxima are high . however , through selection of different initial test points across the parameter space to commence the search , one can avoid repeatedly falling into the same local maxima , and a global maxima can be obtained .    for each state in our simulations , a number of such searches were performed .",
    "henceforth , we simply denote @xmath44 as the maximum value pertaining to each state across these multiple searches .",
    "1000 pure states were sampled randomly from @xmath53 through uniform distributions .",
    "the pre - defined error criterion was taken to be 0.0001 .",
    "the results are given in the histogram in fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram_pure ] .",
    "( colour online ) @xmath54 values for 1000 randomly sampled pure states , with a bin - width of 0.1 .",
    "red : polynomial fit showing population decay .",
    "black : @xmath55 , demarcation between local and non - local states . ]",
    "we see that most of the bell states respect the cglmp inequality . out of the 1000 states",
    ", it is found that only 8.9% violate the cglmp inequality .",
    "a polynomial fit shows the population of the sampled states decreasing as a function of @xmath44 , at a rate @xmath56 , where @xmath57 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram_pure ] ) .",
    "this reflects the sparsity of states that obey the cglmp criterion for non - locality in contrast to the bell criterion .",
    "in fact , there is only one state with @xmath30 from among the 1000 random states .",
    "the space of mixed states is much larger , being of dimension 15 .",
    "we examine the rather small subset of states which have the basis states @xmath58 ( eq .  [ eq : states_maximal_p ] ) as their eigenstates .",
    "@xmath59 once again , we find that the cglmp prescription fails to identify non - locality , this time more dramatically .",
    "we sample 100 random mixed states , and implement the nelder - mead optimisation technique , in the same manner that was done for pure states .",
    "[ fig : histogram_mixed ] shows the maximum @xmath44 values obtained for each state .",
    "all of these states have values of @xmath44 very close to zero , despite being maximally bell non - local .",

    "( colour online ) @xmath54 plotted as a function of entanglement , @xmath60 . ]",
    "it is clear from figs .",
    "[ fig : histogram_pure ] , [ fig : histogram_mixed ] that cglmp is not necessarily stronger than bell , and that it fails to identify a large family of non - local states , unless perhaps they are maximally entangled .",
    "since it fares well for fully entangled states , we examine if @xmath44 is more sensitive to entanglement of the state .",
    "we consider pure bell states .",
    "the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix are two fold degenerate and can be written as @xmath61 the quantity @xmath62 is a measure of entanglement , with @xmath63 representing a fully entangled state , and @xmath64 , a partially entangled state with the corresponding entropy of the reduced density matrix being @xmath65 .",
    "[ fig : ent_cglmp ] shows the variation of @xmath44 with respect to @xmath62 for the 1000 states employed earlier .",
    "the scatter in the plot clearly shows that @xmath44 bears no affinity to entanglement either , except in the limiting case of maximum entanglement .",
    "the main result of this paper is that cglmp inequality ( and its equivalent formulation @xcite ) , as a measure of non - locality , fails to identify a large class of bell states , both in pure and mixed sectors .",
    "it is also not sensitive to entanglement , except when the state is also fully entangled .",
    "there are many measures of non - classicality such as discord , entanglement and non - locality .",
    "though undoubtedly a measure of non - classicality , it is not clear whether a cglmp violation reflects some or all of these measures , or if it gives a new measure . strictly speaking ,",
    "bell and cglmp criteria are based on two independent notions of non - locality , even if they agree in the case of @xmath33 systems .",
    "therefore , it must be admitted that the precise non - classical nature of even those states which respect bell but violate cglmp still remains to be understood .",
    "notwithstanding these reservations , there is no doubt that the ingenious experiments which have verified cglmp violation @xcite have indeed detected a non - trivial non - classical feature of quantum states in higher dimensions which is not available for two qubit states .",
