    "consider a distributed detection network consisting of a set of sensors and fusion nodes .",

    "each fusion node fuses the received messages from its child nodes into a new message and then sends it to the fusion node at the next level for further integration .",
    "a final decision is eventually made at a central fusion node , usually called the fusion center .",
    "a fundamental question is how to fuse messages at each fusion node such that the fusion center makes the best decision , in the sense of optimizing a global objective function .",
    "for example , under the neyman - pearson criterion , the objective is to minimize the probability of missed detection with an upper bound constraint on the probability of false alarm ; under the bayesian criterion , the objective is to minimize the total error probability .    the distributed detection problem has been investigated extensively in the context of different network architectures . in the well - studied _ parallel network _",
    "@xcite@xcite where sensors communicate with the fusion center directly , with the assumption of independent sensor observations conditioned on either hypothesis , the optimal fusion rule under the bayesian criterion is simply a likelihood - rate test with a threshold given by the ratio of the prior probabilities .",
    "the _ tandem network _ has been considered in @xcite@xcite , in which each fusion node combines the observation from its own sensor with the message it receives from its child node at one level down , and then transmits the combined message to its parent node at the next level up .",
    "we call a collection of fusion rules at all fusion nodes a _",
    "fusion strategy_. specifically , @xcite considers the problem of finding the optimal fusion strategy in such a tandem network under both neyman - pearson and bayesian criteria .",
    "the _ bounded - height tree network _ has been considered in @xcite@xcite , where the leaves are sensors , the root is the fusion center , and every other node is a fusion node that fuses the messages from its child nodes and sends a new message to its parent node . in general , finding a fusion strategy that minimizes the total error probability at the fusion center in bounded - height trees is computationally intractable even for a network with moderate number of nodes .",
    "therefore , many recent papers focus on the asymptotic decay rate of the total error probability as the number of sensors goes to infinity . in balanced bounded - height trees where all the leaf nodes are at the same distance from the fusion center , a fusion strategy that @xmath1-achieves the optimal decay exponent",
    "is studied @xcite , in which all the fusion nodes at the same level use the same likelihood - ratio test as the fusion rule .",
    "the _ unbounded - height tree network _ has been considered in @xcite@xcite . in particular , @xcite considered balanced binary relay trees with the structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tree ] . in this configuration ,",
    "the leaf nodes , depicted as circles , are sensors generating binary messages independently and forward these binary messages to their parent nodes .",
    "each node depicted as a diamond is a fusion ( relay ) node , which fuses the two binary messages received from its child nodes and forwards the new message upward .",
    "ultimately , the fusion center at the root makes an overall decision .",
    "this tree is balanced in the sense that all the leaf nodes are at the same distance from the fusion center , and it is binary in the sense that each nonleaf node has two child nodes .",
    "this architecture is of interest because it represents the worst - case scenario in the sense that the minimum distance from the sensors to the fusion center is the largest .",
    "assuming that all nonleaf nodes use the same fusion rule , the unit - threshold likelihood - ratio test ( ulrt ) .",
    "@xcite shows the convergence of detection error probabilities using a lyaponov method . under the same assumptions , we further show in @xcite that the decay rate of the total error probability is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the number of sensors . under the equally - likely prior probability assumption ,",
    "ulrt is the locally optimal fusion rule in the sense that the total error probability of each node is minimized after each fusion .",
    "however , we do not expect the strategy consisting of repeated ulrt fusion rules ( which we call the _ greedy _ strategy ) to be globally optimal in the sense that the total error probability at the fusion center is minimized .",
    "in this paper we are interested in the following questions :    * what is the globally optimal strategy for balanced binary relay trees ? * how much difference in terms of the total error probability is there between the globally optimal strategy and the greedy strategy ?",
    "we answer the first question by formulating the problem as a dynamic program and characterizing the optimal strategy using bellman s equations .",
    "we answer the second question by introducing the notion of string - submodularity and showing that the reduction in the total error probability is a string - submodular function . subsequently , we show that the reduction in the total error probability achieved by the greedy strategy is at least a factor @xmath0 of that achieved by the globally optimal strategy .    .",

    "we consider the problem of testing binary hypothesis between @xmath4 and @xmath5 in a balanced binary relay tree , with structure shown in fig .",

    "let @xmath6 be any fusion node ( i.e. , @xmath6 is a nonleaf node ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath7 the set of child nodes of @xmath6 .",

    "ultimately , the fusion center makes an overall decision .",
    "it turns out that the only meaningful rules to aggregate two binary messages in this case are simply ` and ' and ` or ' rules defined as follows :    * and rule ( denoted by @xmath14 ) : a parent node decides @xmath15 if and only if both its child nodes send  @xmath15 ; * or rule ( denoted by @xmath16 ) : a parent node decides @xmath17 if and only if both its child nodes send @xmath17 .    henceforth , we only consider the case where each fusion node in the tree choose a fusion rule from @xmath18 .",
    "we assume that all sensors are independent with identical type i error probability @xmath19 and identical type ii error probability @xmath20 .",

    "hence , it suffices to consider the case where the initial pair satisfies @xmath30 .",
    "we can derive similar result for the case where @xmath31 ( e.g. , by only flipping the decision at the fusion center ) . in the case",
    "where @xmath32 , the type i and ii error probabilities add up to one regardless of the fusion rule used .",
    "hence , this case is not of interest .",
    "notice that the ulrt fusion rule is either the @xmath14 rule or the @xmath16 rule , depending on the values of the type i and type ii error probabilities at a particular level of the tree .",
    "more precisely , we have    * if @xmath33 , then the ulrt fusion rule is @xmath14 ; * if @xmath34 , then the ulrt fusion rule is @xmath16 ; * if @xmath35 , then the total error probability remains unchanged after using @xmath14 or @xmath16",
    ". moreover , the error probability pairs at the next level @xmath36 after using @xmath14 or @xmath16 are symmetric about the line @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , we call both @xmath14 and @xmath16 the ulrt fusion rule in this case .",
    "we define a fusion strategy as a string of fusion rules @xmath38 used at levels @xmath39 , denoted by @xmath40 .",
    "let the collection of all possible fusion strategies with length @xmath41 be @xmath42 : @xmath43 for a given initial error probability pair @xmath44 at the sensor level , the pair @xmath45 at the fusion center ( level @xmath41 ) is a function of @xmath44 and the specific fusion strategy @xmath46 used .",
    "we consider the bayesian criterion in this paper , under which the objective is to minimize the total error probability @xmath47 at the fusion center , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the prior probabilities of the two hypotheses , respectively .",
    "equivalently , we can find a strategy that maximizes the reduction of the total error probability between the sensors and the fusion center .",

    ", we derive the @xmath41-optimal fusion strategy for balanced binary relay trees with height @xmath41 using bellman s equations .",
    "we then show that the 2-optimal strategy is equivalent to the ulrt strategy .",
    "moreover , we show that the reduction of the total error probability is a string - submodular function ( as defined in section iii - c ) , which implies that the greedy strategy is close to the optimal fusion strategy in terms of the reduction in the total error probability .",
    "in this section , we formulate the problem of finding the optimal fusion strategy using a deterministic dynamic programming model .",
    "first we define the necessary elements of this dynamic model .",
    "* _ dynamic system _ : we define the error probability pair at the @xmath21th level @xmath28 as the system state , denoted by @xmath55 .",

    "therefore , the set of all possible states is @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , given the fusion rule , the _ state transition function _ is deterministic . if we choose @xmath58 , then @xmath59 on the other hand , if we choose @xmath60 , then @xmath61 * _ rewards _ : at each level @xmath21 , we define the instantaneous reward to be the reduction of the total error probability after fusing with @xmath23 : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are functions of the previous state @xmath65 and the fusion rule @xmath23 .",

    ", we have @xmath68 if we let @xmath69 , that is , we start calculating the reduction from the sensor level , then the above cumulative reward function is the same as the global objective function defined in section  ii",
    ". therefore , for given initial state @xmath70 , we have to solve the following optimization problem to find the global optimal strategy over horizon @xmath41 : @xmath71 the globally optimal strategy @xmath72 is @xmath73 notice that @xmath55 depends on the previous state @xmath65 and the fusion rule @xmath23 .",
    "hence we write the state at level @xmath21 to be @xmath74 .",

    "also , we can generalize the formulation to non - equal prior probability scenarios .",
    "the complexity of the explicit solution to bellman s equations grows exponentially with respect to the horizon @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , it is usually intractable to compute the @xmath41-optimal strategy if @xmath41 is sufficiently large .",
    "an alternative strategy is the ulrt strategy , which consists of repeating ulrt fusion rule at all levels .",
    "we have shown in  @xcite that the decay rate of the total error probability with this strategy is @xmath2 .",
    "next we study whether the ulrt strategy is the same as the @xmath41-optimal strategy .",
    "if not , does the ulrt strategy provide a reasonable approximation of the @xmath41-optimal strategy ?      in this section , we show that the 2-optimal strategy is the same as the ulrt strategy .",
    "moreover , we give an counterexample which shows that the ulrt strategy is not 3-optimal .",
    "consider the 2-optimal problem in the balanced binary relay tree with height 2 : @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "the 2-optimal strategy in this case is @xmath84 we have the following theorem .",
    "( because of lack of space , many of the proofs here are omitted . )",
    "a strategy @xmath85 is 2-optimal if and only if @xmath85 is the ulrt strategy .",
    "this result also applies to any sub - tree with height 2 within a balanced binary relay tree with arbitrary height @xmath86 .",
    "however , the ulrt strategy is not in general optimal for multiple levels ; i.e. , @xmath86 , as the following counter - example for @xmath87 shows .    let the initial state be @xmath88 , in which case the ulrt strategy is @xmath89 .",
    "as shown in fig .",

    "fig : ex ] .",
    "similar counterexamples can be found for cases where @xmath91 .",
    "hence , the ulrt strategy is not in general @xmath41-optimal for @xmath92 . in the next section",
    ", we will introduce and employ the notion of string - submodularity to quantify the gap in performance between optimal and ulrt strategies for @xmath92 .",
    "submodularity of functions over finite sets plays an important role in combinatorial optimization .",
    "it has been shown that the greedy strategy provides at least a constant - factor approximation to the optimal strategy .",
    "for example , the celebrated result of nemhauser _ et al . _",
    "@xcite states that for maximizing a monotone submodular function @xmath93 over a uniform matroid such that @xmath94 ( here @xmath95 denotes the empty set ) , the value of the greedy strategy is no less than a factor @xmath0 of that of the optimal strategy .",
    "note that the submodular functions studied in most previous papers are defined on the power set of a given finite set . however , many stochastic optimization problems concern optimizing objective functions over a finite horizon , where we have to choose an action from a given finite set at each iteration . in these cases ,",
    "the objective function usually depends on the order of actions , and repeating the same action is allowed .",
    "hence , we can not directly apply the result of nemhauser _ et al .",

    "* _ globally optimal solution _ : consider the problem of finding a string that maximizes @xmath111 under the constraint that the string length is not larger than @xmath114 .",
    "because the function @xmath111 is monotone , it suffices to consider the stronger constraint with fixed length @xmath114 : @xmath115 * _ greedy solution _ : a string @xmath116 is called _ greedy _ if @xmath117    for a deterministic dynamic system , the diminishing return property can be simplified as follows .    _ lemma 1 _ : for any @xmath118 and @xmath119 , we have @xmath120 if and only if @xmath121    consider a submodular function @xmath122 such that    * @xmath123 ; * for any greedy strings @xmath124 with a length less than @xmath114 and optimal strings @xmath125 ( optimal with respect to ) , @xmath126 .",
    "then any greedy string @xmath127 of length @xmath114 satisfies @xmath128      we consider balanced binary relay trees with even heights .",
