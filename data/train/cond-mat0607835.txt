    "two - component fermi gas with zero - range interaction at infinite scattering length  @xcite , frequently referred to as the unitary fermi gas , has attracted intense attention across many subfields of physics .",
    "experimentally , the system can be realized in atomic traps using the feshbach resonance and has been extensively studied  @xcite .",
    "since the fermion density is the only dimensionful scale of the unitary fermi gas , its properties are universal , i.e. , independent of details of the interparticle interaction .",
    "the unitary fermi gas is an idealization of dilute nuclear matter and may be relevant to the physics of neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "it has been also suggested that its understanding may be important for high-@xmath4 superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "the austere simplicity of the unitary fermi gas implies great difficulties for theoretical treatment , because there seems to be no parameter for a perturbation theory .",
    "the usual green s function techniques for the many - body problem are completely unreliable here since the expansion parameter @xmath5 becomes infinite in the unitarity limit .",
    "considerable progress has been made by monte carlo simulations  @xcite , however these simulations have many limitations , which become especially evident for systems with a population imbalance between two fermion components ( finite polarization ) .",
    "recently , we have proposed a new approach for the unitary fermi gas based on the systematic expansion in terms of the dimensionality of space  @xcite , utilizing the specialty of _ four _ spatial dimensions in the unitarity limit  @xcite . in this approach",
    ", one would extend the problem to arbitrary spatial dimension @xmath1 and consider @xmath1 is close to , but below , four .",
    "then one performs all calculations treating @xmath0 as a small parameter of the perturbative expansion .",
    "results for the physical case of three spatial dimensions are obtained by extrapolating the series expansions to @xmath6 .",
    "we used this @xmath2 expansion around four spatial dimensions to calculate thermodynamic quantities and fermion quasiparticle spectrum in the unitarity limit and found results which are quite consistent with those obtained by monte carlo simulations and experiments  @xcite . very recently , this expansion has been successfully applied to atom - dimer and dimer - dimer scatterings in vacuum  @xcite .",
    "thus there are compelling reasons to hope that the limit @xmath7 is not only theoretically interesting but also practically useful , despite the fact that the expansion parameter @xmath2 is one at @xmath8 .",
    "one may hope that the expansion over @xmath9 will be as fruitful for the fermi gas at unitarity as it has been in the theory of the second order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "this paper has four main purposes .",
    "we will give a detailed account of the @xmath2 expansion for the unitary fermi gas studied in our recent letter  @xcite , extend the results to the fermi gas with large but finite scattering length , study a phase diagram of a polarized fermi gas near the unitarity limit , and develop a complementary expansion for the unitary fermi gas around two spatial dimensions .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "we start with the study of two - body scattering in vacuum in the unitarity limit for arbitrary spatial dimension @xmath10 .",
    "this study will clarify why systematic expansions around four and two spatial dimensions are possible for the unitary fermi gas ( sec .",
    "[ sec : vacuum ] ) .",
    "the @xmath2 expansion is developed for an unpolarized fermi gas both at unitarity and at large , but finite , scattering length in sec .",
    "[ sec:4d ] .",
    "then we apply the @xmath2 expansion to the unitary fermi gas with unequal densities for the two fermion components .",
    "such a system will be called `` polarized '' fermi gas and has been recently realized in experiments  @xcite .",
    "the phase structure of the polarized fermi gas in the unitary regime is investigated based on the @xmath2 expansion in sec .",
    "[ sec : polarization ] .",
    "we also show in sec .",
    "[ sec:2d ] that there exists a systematic expansion for the fermi gas in the unitarity limit around _ two _ spatial dimensions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : matching ] , we make an exploratory discussion to connect the two expansions around four and two spatial dimensions . the summary and concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "nussinov and nussinov  @xcite were the first two to recognize the special role of two and four spatial dimensions in the unitarity limit .",
    "their arguments are very simple and we review them here for completeness .    in low dimensions @xmath11 , any attractive potential possesses at least one bound state .",
    "therefore , the threshold of the appearance of the first two - body bound state corresponds to the zero coupling .",
    "it follows that the fermi gas in the unitary limit corresponds to a noninteracting fermi gas at @xmath12 and the energy per particle approaches that of the free fermi gas in this limit .",
    "if one defines a parameter @xmath13 as the ratio of the energy density of the fermi gas at unitarity and that of the free fermi gas with the same density , @xmath14 then according to the above argument @xmath15 as @xmath12 from above .",
    "( the singular character of @xmath16 was also recognized in the earlier work  @xcite . )",
    "now we consider dimensions close to four . at infinite scattering length , the wave function of two fermions with opposite spin behaves like @xmath17 at small @xmath18 , where @xmath18 is the separation between two fermions .",
    "therefore , the normalization integral of the wave function takes the form @xmath19 which has a singularity at @xmath20 in high dimensions @xmath21 . for these dimensions",
    "the two - body wave function has infinite probability weight at the origin , and the fermion pair looks like a pointlike boson . from this observation , nussinov and",
    "nussinov concluded that the unitary fermi gas at @xmath7 becomes a noninteracting bose gas .",
    "in particular , the energy per particle at fixed fermi energy goes to zero as @xmath22 , because all bosons condense into the zero energy state and their binding energy is also zero . according to this argument ,",
    "@xmath23 as @xmath22 from below .",
    "this qualitative observation by nussinov and nussinov , however , leaves many questions unanswered :    1 .",
    "how do the bosons interact with each other ? 2 .",
    "how fast does @xmath13 approach 0 as @xmath22 ?",
    "can one develop a theory based on an expansion over @xmath0 ?    in order to develop a framework that can be used to answer these questions , we need to review the two - body scattering in a general number of spatial dimension @xmath1 , with special attention to @xmath1 near four and two , from the perspective of the diagrammatic approach",
    ". this consideration will provide a foundation for the construction of systematic expansions for the many - body problem of the unitary fermi gas .",
    "one can describe the system of spin-@xmath24 fermions with short - range interaction by the following lagrangian density ( here and below @xmath25 ) : @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the fermion mass and @xmath28 is the bare attractive coupling between two fermions . the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : l_vacuum ] ) corresponds to the interaction potential @xmath29 it is well known for @xmath8 that in order to have a finite scattering length , the potential in eq .",
    "( [ vdelta ] ) has to be regularized : one chooses a particular shape of the potential ( for example , the square - well shape ) , and then takes the width of the potential to be zero simultaneously with adjusting the height so that the zero - energy wave function approaches a finite limit .",
    "we shall show that it is true for @xmath1 between two and four considering the two - body scattering .",
    "the @xmath30-matrix of the two - body scattering is given by the infinite summation of bubble diagrams .",
    "as a result , its inverse is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the kinetic energy of nonrelativistic particles and we introduced the shorthand notation @xmath33 the integration over @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : c_0 ] ) is ultraviolet divergent as @xmath35 if @xmath36 and needs to be regularized .",
    "the usual way to do this regularization is to assume that there is an upper limit @xmath37 in the momentum integral of eq .",
    "( [ eq : c_0 ] ) , and to adjust the @xmath37 dependence of @xmath28 so that the physics does not depend on @xmath37 .",
    "if we add and subtract the value of the integral at @xmath38 , we have @xmath39 the second integral is now @xmath40 at large @xmath34 and converges for @xmath41 .",
    "thus for @xmath41 one can set the cutoff to infinity in the second integral .",
    "the first integral is still ultraviolet divergent but is independent of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and it can be absorbed into the definition of the renormalized coupling @xmath44 as follows : @xmath45 the zero range limit corresponds to sending @xmath46 but keeping the renormalized coupling @xmath44 finite by an appropriate choice of the bare coupling @xmath47 . in this limit",
    "all physical quantities should depend only on @xmath44 but not on @xmath28 and @xmath37 separately . from the above discussion",
    "it is clear that this limit can be taken only for @xmath41 ; for @xmath21 the divergences in the fermion loop can no longer be compensated by the renormalization of one coupling constant @xmath28 .",
    "there is no universal zero range and large scattering length limit for @xmath21 .",
    "in this paper we will not use the momentum - cutoff regularization described above .",
    "rather we shall use the dimensional regularization , in which the integrals are evaluated in dimensions where they are ultraviolet finite and then the results are analytically continued to the dimension @xmath1 .",
    "for example , the integral @xmath48 converges only for @xmath49 , but we will use the analytical formula @xmath50 for all values of @xmath1 .",
    "this regularization scheme is particularly convenient because the divergent integral in the formula defining the renormalized coupling @xmath44 is zero , @xmath51 and hence the renormalized coupling is just the bare coupling , @xmath52 . in other words , in the dimensional regularization the subtraction of the leading divergence of the fermion bubble diagram is implemented automatically .",
    "as long as physical quantities are insensitive to the ultraviolet cutoff , which is the case for @xmath41 , the results of the dimensional and momentum - cutoff regularizations coincide .    in the dimensional regularization ,",
    "the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : c_0 ] ) vanishes for @xmath38 ( scatterings at threshold ) .",
    "therefore the limit of infinite scattering length where @xmath53 corresponds to @xmath54 . in this limit the integration over @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : c_0 ] ) can be evaluated explicitly , @xmath55 this expression has a pole at @xmath56 originating from the ultraviolet divergence of the @xmath34 integration .",

    "the @xmath30-matrix near four spatial dimensions becomes @xmath58 from this equation it is clear what is special about @xmath1 close to four : as the number of dimensions approaches four from below , the two - fermion scattering amplitude has the form of the scattering process that occurs through the propagation of an intermediate boson whose mass is @xmath59 , as depicted in fig .

    "boson_.    an important point is that the effective coupling of the two fermions into the boson @xmath65 is small near four dimensions .",
    "this fact indicates the possibility to construct a perturbative expansion for the unitary fermi gas near four spatial dimensions in terms of the small parameter @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , a perturbative expansion around two spatial dimensions is possible .",
    "this is because the inverse of the @xmath30-matrix in eq .",

    "[ sec : polarization ] , all interesting exotic phases of the polarized fermi gas appear on the bec side of the unitarity limit .",
