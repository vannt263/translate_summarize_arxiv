    "using weights has become an integral part of analysing ground - based observations of stellar oscillations .",
    "this is due to the significant variations in data quality during a typical observing campaign , especially when two or more telescopes are used .",
    "the usual practice is to calculate the weights , @xmath2 , for a time series from the measurement uncertainties , @xmath3 , according to @xmath4 .",
    "if weights are not used when calculating the power spectrum , a small fraction of bad data points can dominate and increase the noise floor significantly .",
    "these `` raw '' weights can then be adjusted to minimize the noise level in the final power spectrum by identifying and revising those uncertainties that are too optimistic , and at the same time rescaling the uncertainties to be in agreement with the actual noise levels in the data .",
    "we have previously described the application of this process to velocity observations of solar - like oscillations @xcite .",
    "these noise - optimized weights can be further adjusted to minimize the sidelobes in the spectral window that arise from daily gaps .",
    "this was done on a night - by - night basis for our two - site observations of @xmath0  cen  a @xcite , @xmath0  cen  b @xcite and @xmath1  hyi @xcite . however",
    ", that procedure was not automatic and is therefore impractical for our recent multi - site campaign on procyon @xcite , which involved observations with 11 spectrographs spread over nearly four weeks .",
    "we have therefore developed a new method for obtaining the sidelobe - optimized weights ( kjeldsen et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "the new method operates with two timescales .",
    "all data segments of a certain length ( 2hr , for example ) are required to have the same total weight throughout the time series , with the relaxing condition that variations on long time scales ( @xmath512hr , for example ) are allowed .",
    "the method produces the cleanest possible spectral window in terms of suppressing the sidelobes . in order to test the method ,",
    "we have applied it to the published data on @xmath0  cen a and b , and @xmath1  hyi , allowing a comparison for the three stars of the resulting power spectra and spectral window to those coming from using the original noise- and sidelobe - optimized weights .",
    "the data discussed below originate from three spectrographs : uves on the eso vlt at paranal , chile ; ucles on the aat at siding spring observatory in australia ; and harps on the 3.6-m eso telescope at la silla , chile .",
    "the @xmath0  cen  a data considered here",
    "are those for which the sidelobe - optimization procedure was first developed . the data consist of dual - site observations with uves and ucles .",
    "figure  [ fig.ts ] shows the time series of weights for three optimization schemes discussed above .",
    "the upper panel shows the noise - optimized weights @xcite , the middle panel shows the sidelobe - optimized weights obtained by adjusting on a night - by - night basis @xcite , while the lower panel shows the sidelobe - optimized weights obtained with the new method .",
    "the ucles data ( black symbols ) can be identified in the upper panel as the 5 nights with relatively low weight , as compared to the three nights of uves data ( grey symbols ) .    as can be seen by comparing the upper two panels in fig .",
    "[ fig.ts ] , the sidelobe - optimized spectral window in @xcite was obtained by reducing the weights of the first two ucles nights and increasing those of the ucles data in the period with observations from both telescopes .",
    "this resulted in a significant decrease of the sidelobes but it also increased the noise level in the power spectrum because higher weight was given to lower - precision data .",
    "there was also a decrease in frequency resolution due to the suppression of the first two nights of observations , effectively shortening the time base of the observations .",
    "figure  [ fig.acawin ] shows the spectral windows for the three weighting schemes and fig .",
    "[ fig.acapow ] shows the corresponding power spectra . in table",
    "[ tab.res ] we give the noise levels , effective observing times and frequency resolutions , where the latter are given as the fwhm of the spectral window in power .",
    ".results of applying different weight optimization schemes .",
    "noise levels were measured in the amplitude spectra in the range 45mhz for @xmath0  cen  a and @xmath1  hyi , and at 67mhz for @xmath0  cen  b. [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     table  [ tab.res ] shows that the two sidelobe - optimization methods result in similar noise levels and both , as expected , have higher noise than that in the noise - optimized power spectrum .",
    "however , the new method results in a longer effective observing time and better frequency resolution than the night - by - night sidelobe - optimized weights from @xcite . the improvement can be understood by looking at fig .",
    "[ fig.ts ] , where we see that the new sidelobe - optimized weights are more homogeneous and give higher weight to the two first nights , increasing the effective time base of the observations .",
    "the improvement is evident in the spectral window ( fig .",
    "[ fig.acawin ] ) and also in the power spectrum itself ( fig .",
    "[ fig.acapow ] ) , where the bottom panel displays more narrow peaks than the other two panels . in fig .",
    "[ fig.zoom ] we show a close - up of the region surrounding the peak at 2572.7@xmath6hz .",
    "this peak was listed as both an @xmath7 and @xmath8 mode , with the same frequency , in @xcite . using the new weights ,",
    "the double - mode nature of this peak is now directly visible in the power spectrum as a result of the increased frequency resolution .",
    "thus , we expect that new scientific results could emerge from a re - analysis of the data using the new weights",
    ". this will be investigated in a future paper .      for this star ,",
    "the situation is less clear - cut due to the low signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of the oscillations detected in observations from uves and ucles @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig.acbts ] we show the three time series of weights and in fig .  [ fig.acbwin ] the corresponding spectral windows .",
    "the power spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.acbpow ] .",
    "the two sidelobe - optimization methods provide similar results and the new method does not give much improvement over the original sidelobe - optimized weights .",
    "it results in slightly lower sidelobes and a slightly better frequency resolution ( 1.34 vs 1.44@xmath6hz , table  [ tab.res ] ) , but also in a slightly higher noise level than the night - by - night sidelobe - optimized weights . for both procedures ,",
    "the frequency resolution is better than with the noise - optimized weights , but the noise levels are almost a factor of two higher .",
    "this can be critical for a data set with an already limited s / n , illustrating that the sidelobe - optimization procedure is not necessarily optimal for all data - sets , despite the excellent spectral window .",
    "we consider the dual - site observations of @xmath1  hyi with harps and ucles published by @xcite .",
    "the time series of the weights is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.bhts ] , the spectral windows in fig .",
    "[ fig.bhwin ] and the power spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig.bhpow ] .",
    "the resulting numbers are again given in table  [ tab.res ] .",
    "sidelobe optimization increases the noise level greatly as compared to the noise - optimized weights .",
    "this occurs for both versions of sidelobe - optimization , although less so for the new method .",
    "more significantly , whereas the frequency resolution is not affected by using the night - by - night version of sidelobe optimization , the new version gives some improvement ( 1.16 vs 1.32@xmath6hz ) .",
    "the situation here is similar to the case of @xmath0  cen  a : the ucles data are less precise than the harps measurements but span a longer time - base , and the new method assigns higher weight to the first and ( especially ) the last nights of the ucles data ( fig .",
    "[ fig.bhts ] ) , increasing the effective observing time .",
    "we have applied a new method for calculating sidelobe - optimized weights to three existing data - sets .",
    "the main advantage of this method is the automatic convergence to the solution that provides the cleanest possible spectral window .",
    "for the three stars , @xmath0  cen  a , b and @xmath1  hyi , the new weights discussed here improve the data sets in terms of frequency resolution and/or noise levels as compared to the published versions of the weights . for @xmath0  cen  a",
    ", the improvement is at a level where new scientific results could emerge .",
    "the method has thus been tested successfully and can be applied with confidence to the new multi - site procyon data presented by @xcite ."
