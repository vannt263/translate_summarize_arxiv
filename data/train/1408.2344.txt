    "all these phenomena arise when a small number of electrons are introduced into the lattice .",
    "the characteristics and mobility of excess electrons is strongly determined by their interaction with the lattice through electron - phonon coupling .",
    "one of the manifestations of the electron - phonon interaction is the formation of a polaron , a quasiparticle formed by the excess electron and the structural deformations it induces @xcite .",
    "depending on the spatial extent of the polaronic wavefunction and associated structural distortions two types of polarons can be identified : in the small - polaron model the range of the distortion is of the order of the lattice constant , whereas in the large polaron the wavefunction spreads over several lattice sites and exhibits a more free - carrier - like behavior .",
    "large polarons show a mobility inversely proportional to the number of longitudinal optical phonons .",
    "in contrast , small polarons form highly localized in - gap states and can hop to adjacent lattice sites when thermally activated @xcite .",
    "experimental information on the role of polarons in srtio@xmath0 is abundant , yet controversial @xcite .",
    "the key question is whether it is a large or a small polaron that is formed .",

    "the validity of this picture is supported by recent angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy data @xcite .",
    "pump - probe spectroscopy in lightly photoexcited srtio@xmath0 suggested that itinerant electron polarons are the origin of diffusive lattice distortions @xcite .",
    "however , the large - polaron model can not explain the in - gap bulk states in the conductive phase revealed in photoemission spectroscopy @xcite . instead",
    ", these highly localized states are attributable to small polarons trapped in bulk sites .",
    "this interpretation is reinforced by the recent observation that photoexcited electrons relax into self - trapped polaron states @xcite .",
    "electron trapping has been also invoked to explain the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in srtio@xmath4 thin films @xcite and single crystals @xcite .",
    "to complicate the situation even further , there are indications that excess electrons localized in trapped states can coexists with free carriers @xcite .",
    "no coherent picture can explain all these experiments so far ; this has sparked an animated debate and poses a serious challenge to theory .",
    "computational studies provide additional insights . based on density functional theory ( dft)+u , hybrid dft and model hamiltonians",
    ", it was suggested that the two additional electrons donated by a single oxygen vacancy v@xmath5 induce one singly - occupied in - gap state mostly localized at the ti atoms near the v@xmath5 , and one state delocalized in the conduction band @xcite .",
    "this conclusion successfully clarifies transport and optical properties in reduced srtio@xmath0 , but is inconsistent with the observed v@xmath5-induced mit @xcite , because the predicted free carriers would be mobile even at low temperature .",
    "the present study aims to provide a unified and coherent explanation of the role of excess electrons in srtio@xmath0 .",
    "in particular it investigates the conditions under which localized and free - electron - like states can form , coexist and propagate .",
    "we show that a small - polaron regime is established if the carrier density @xmath6 is higher than a critical value , both in the low - temperature antiferrodistortive ( afd ) and in the cubic structure . below this critical density ,",
    "the excess electrons will be delocalized or form large polarons , leading to a metallic solution without in - gap states , in nice agreement with experiment .",
    "moreover , we provide theoretical evidence that the two excess electrons donated by v@xmath5 form two self - trapped electrons , which become mobile if thermally activated , thus supporting the temperature - driven mit observed in reduced srtio@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "for our calculations we adopted spin - polarized dft+u within the gradient - corrected perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) functional @xcite using the vasp @xcite .",

    "the kohn sham orbitals were projected on to maximally localized wannier functions @xcite using the wannier90 code .",
    "@xcite for the construction of the correlated subspace we have followed the hybrid `` d - dp hamiltonian''-like approach suggested by vaugier and coworkers@xcite , where the wannier functions are generated for the metal @xmath8 and oxygen @xmath10 orbitals , and only the @xmath8 bands are removed for the calculation of the effective interactions . following this procedure we obtained @xmath11 ev and @xmath12 ev , and set @xmath13 ev , which is in line with previous dft+u studies of polarons in srtio@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we considered both the cubic and the low - temperature ( below 110 k ) tetragonal afd phase of srtio@xmath0 and at the optimized lattice constants ( a@xmath14 = 3.948  , a@xmath15 = 3.937  , c / a@xmath15=1.0055 ) . adopting these lattice constants",

    "we have followed the following strategy , proposed by deskins _",
    "@xcite :    1 .",
    "first , we have chosen the specific ti sites at which we aim to stabilize a polaron and substituted that distinct ti with a v atom and let the structure relax within a spin - polarized set - up . in this way we break the symmetry and allow an expansion of the oxygen octahedron around the v. 2 .",
    "second , we placed back the ti atom in the v position and let the structure relax within a spin - polarized set - up by initializing a local magnetic moment equal to one in this specific ti site .    for particularly complicated polaronic configurations ( i.e. difficult to converge )",
    "we have added an intermediate step in which we have performed a step-2 calculation using a larger value of the on - site @xmath7 at the ti site at which we wanted to form the polaron . in this way we could more easily attract the excess electron to that specific ti site . in a subsequent run",
    ", we recovered the usual value of @xmath7 and let the system relax .",
    "this procedure was repeated for several polaronic configurations and the corresponding total energies were compared to the total energy of the delocalized solution .",
    "we verified that the results were converged with respect to the energy cutoff ( 400 ev ) and number of k - points ( 12@xmath2012@xmath2012 with respect to the primitive cubic cell ) .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of small polaron hopping in srtio@xmath4 with @xmath21 were performed at simulated temperatures ranging from 700 k to 1000 k for 5 ps with a time step of 1 fs . the md are also performed within the dft+u framework .",
    "we expect that the inclusion of the inter - site effective interaction @xmath22 @xcite , which have never been employed to describe the dynamics of polarons , could improve further the agreement with experiments . for srtio@xmath0",
    "our crpa procedure delivers @xmath22=1.7 ev .",
    "in this section we present and discuss the results obtained for the nb - doping and oxygen vacancies calculations .",
    "the substitution of one ti with one nb in a cubic @xmath19 sc , corresponding to an electron density @xmath6 of @xmath23 @xmath24 , establishes a non - conducting state with a rather sharp peak at about 0.80 ev below the conduction band minimum ( cbm , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , in line with the experimental values of 1.0 - 1.5 ev @xcite . from an analysis of the charge character",
    "we infer that this state locates almost completely on one distinct ti atom , and gives rise to a @xmath25 configuration with a magnetic moment of about 0.9 @xmath26 .",

    "the stability of the small polaron is determined by the competition between the structural energy required to distort the lattice @xmath38 , and the electronic energy gained by localizing the excess electron at a specific ti site @xmath39 .",
    "we found a positive polaron formation energy of 57 mev for the smallest @xmath19 cubic supercell , which means that the small polaron is stable .",
    "a key parameter , which has been largely overlooked in previous theoretical studies , is the role of the carrier density . to clarify this issue ,",
    "we have performed analogous calculations using larger scs , thus varying the doping concentration @xmath40 from @xmath40=3.7% ( n=3 , @xmath6=6@xmath2010@xmath41 @xmath24 ) to @xmath40=0.5 % ( n=6 , @xmath6=7@xmath2010@xmath42 @xmath24 ) .",
    "we find that the polaron formation energy strongly depends on the carrier density , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1](c ) . for the smallest nb - doping sc ( n=3 )",
    "we have also studied the effects of the change of the volume due to nb - doping .",
    "we found that the lattice constant expands from a = 3.945  to 3.993  and the polaron formation energy increases up to 140 mev .",
    "following vegard s law the volume expansion and its effect on the polaron formation energy becomes negligible for larger supercell for which the nb concentration is very small .    within the low-@xmath43 afd setup the small - polaron formation energy substantially increases for all values of the carrier density [ fig .",
    "[ fig:1](c ) , square symbols ] using the optimized dft+u volume .",
    "this is explained by the larger ti - o bond lengths in the low - temperature afd structure as well as its higher structural flexibility compared to the cubic phase ; both make the small polaron more favorable .",
    "dft - based calculations strongly overestimate the afd distortions however @xcite .",
    "therefore , more realistic values for the afd phase will be closer to those for the cubic phase .",
    "indeed , by performing afd calculations fro the n=4 sc at the experimental lattice constants the polaron formation energy is reduced by about 90 mev as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](c ) .    the stability of the small polaron decreases as the carrier density decreases . for n@xmath16",
    "it eventually becomes negative , indicating that the excess electron is prone to delocalization over the entire sc , or to create a large polaron .",
    "this localized - to - delocalized transition is explained by analyzing the energy balance involved in the electron trapping process .",
    "the small polaron is stable when the electronic energy gain @xmath44 is larger than the structural energy loss @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath38 does not depend on the carrier density , but may depend on the presence of the dopant ( nb ) .",
    "indeed , we found that self - trapping in a perfect ( defect free ) lattice is unstable .",
    "an increased ti@xmath3-o bond length for the o atom binding to a neighboring nb dopant indicate that the dopant provides the crystal with the structural flexibility ( i.e. , small @xmath46 ) needed to accommodate an electron in a locally distorted ti@xmath3 site close to the nb impurity .",
    "this argument applies to other types of structural deformations such as surface reconstructions and steps , which are found to favour small polaron formation .",
    "we have verified that the stability of a polaron decreases by increasing the ti@xmath3-nb distance and that the small polaron solution becomes unstable for ti sites far from the nb dopant .",
    "this indicates that dopants are necessary to activate electron trapping : without the dopant , excess electrons prefer to behave like free carriers .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath39 depends on the carrier density @xmath6 through electronic correlation .",
    "the repulsion among the nb - induced extra electrons is expected to get weaker at low concentration , attenuating the attraction between the excess electrons and the positively charge nb center .",
    "although small , this effect may become relevant for cases in which the polaron energy is very small ( @xmath38 @xmath1 @xmath39 ) .    to ascertain the role of @xmath7 on the polaron formation energy",
    "we have also performed some calculations for different values of @xmath7 ( @xmath47 1 ev with respect to the crpa value ) . in agreement with previous studies we found that the polaron formation energy scales almost linearly with @xmath7@xcite : for @xmath48=4 the polaron formation energy becomes negative for @xmath49 ( cubic ) and @xmath50 ( afd ) .",
    "thus , in the limit of low concentration , @xmath38 becomes larger than @xmath39 , the polaron solution unstable and the excess electron begin to delocalize .",

    "the thermal excitation is high enough to surmount it , resulting in a situation where the trapped and mobile electrons can coexist in the system .",
    "this picture can explain the existence of in - gap states in the conductive phase measured by photoemission spectroscopy studies @xcite , and can be rationalized in terms of an inhomogeneous distribution of impurities or defects as suggested in experimental works @xcite .      to analyze the reduced sample we employed a cubic 5@xmath205@xmath205 sc with one v@xmath5 , resulting in two excess electrons per sc .",
