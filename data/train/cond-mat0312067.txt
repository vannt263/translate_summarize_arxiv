    "recently , synchronization of chaotic dynamical systems has been intensively studied  @xcite .",
    "to some extent this is motivated by its numerous experimental realizations in lasers , electronic circuits or chemical reactions  @xcite . of interest , however , are also theoretical aspects of this phenomenon .",
    "relatively well understood is the problem of synchronization of identical systems . in this case",
    "it is known that synchronization might appear only when the so - called transversal , or conditional  @xcite lyapunov exponents are negative  @xcite .",
    "much less understood , however , remains the problem of partial synchronization that occurs when systems are nonidentical .",
    "in such a case chaotic systems do not fully synchronize which causes fundamental problems even with the very detection of synchronization .",
    "in addition to studying lyapunov spectrum , some other methods to detect this transition were proposed .",
    "for example it was noticed that at the partial synchronization of continuous dynamical systems driven by common noise , the probability distribution of phase difference changes  @xcite .",
    "one of the difficulties in studying synchronization is the lack of analytical insight into this problem .",
    "consequently , most of the results in this field are based on numerical calculations .",
    "it would be desirable to study models that would be exactly solvable if not fully then at least with respect to some properties .    in the present paper we study low - dimensional ( @xmath0 ) linear maps .",
    "such systems have the advantage that under some conditions their lyapunov exponents or at least limits of stability of synchronized state can be obtained analytically",
    ". more detailed nature of synchronization transition is studied numerically .",
    "we show that in the case of discontinuous maps , synchronization is also a discontinuous transition , despite continuously vanishing ( as a function of coupling strength ) lyapunov exponent(s ) . for continuous maps",
    "this transition is found to be continuous .",
    "we also study partial synchronization of nonidentical maps , and its relation with lyapunov exponents .",
    "we show that for tent maps at partial synchronization there are substantial changes in the probability distribution of the synchronization error .",
    "but for bernoulli maps partial synchronization is merely a smooth crossover between synchronized and nonsynchronized regimes .",
    "finally , we examine @xmath1 maps which might be considered as describing synchronization of two identical two - dimensional systems .",
    "this case requires the most subtle analysis , since even in the synchronized state the system is relatively complicated ( synchronized manifold is two - dimensional in this case ) . using some arguments , based on the spectral properties of jacobian of this maps , we locate the point where the synchronized state becomes stable . in some cases ,",
    "this is most likely a global attractor since numerical calculations show that synchronization transition takes place also at this point . however , in some cases , a basin of the synchronized attractor is riddled with basin of another chaotic attractor  @xcite .",
    "we suggests that such a coexistence of synchronized and nonsynchronized chaotic attractors might be a low - dimensional analog of the so - called stable chaos that was found in some spatially extended systems  @xcite .",
    "objects of our main interest are linear maps .",
    "first let us examine a two - dimensional map of the form    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is a piecewise linear function , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 can be interpreted as a time variable . in the present paper",
    "we will use a generalized bernoulli shift map @xmath6 and a tent map @xmath7 where @xmath8 and in most of our numerical calculations we use @xmath9 .",
    "certain aspects of dynamics of piecewise linear maps were already studied  @xcite .",
    "first , let us consider the case of identical systems ( @xmath10 ) . since the bernoulli map has a constant slope ( except a set of zero measure ) , lyapunov exponents @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the this map can be obtained from the eigenvalues of the jacobian of map ( [ map2a])-([map2b ] ) @xmath13 lyapunov exponents of the tent map are more difficult to obtain since in this case the jacobian depends on the values of the arguments of the maps in ( [ map2a])-([map2b ] ) . in particular , jacobian takes the form ( [ matrix2 ] ) only when both arguments are smaller than @xmath14 . when the argument of ( [ map2a ] ) is smaller than @xmath14 but the argument of ( [ map2b ] ) is larger , the jacobian becomes @xmath15 two other possibilities lead to matrices @xmath16 ( larger , smaller ) and @xmath17 ( both larger ) . to determine lyapunov exponents for tent map we would have to consider infinite product of these four matrices in order determined by the dynamics ( [ map2a])-([map2b ] ) , which usually constitutes a formidable analytical task  @xcite .",
    "however , in our case the problem of calculating lyapunov exponents simplifies greatly provided that the difference @xmath18 is negligibly small .",
    "this is always the case in the synchronized phase and from the limits of stability of this phase we will be able to locate the synchronization transition .",
    "when the difference @xmath18 is small the instances when one of the arguments is larger and the other smaller than @xmath14 are very rare .",
    "one can thus neglect contributions coming from matrices @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "consequently , lyapunov exponents in this case are obtained from the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath21 only .    diagonalizing @xmath21 one obtains the following lyapunov exponents @xmath22 with the eigenvector @xmath23 and @xmath24 $ ] with @xmath25 .",
    "let us notice , that @xmath26 is a base vector of a one dimensional transversal manifold on which @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , @xmath28 at @xmath29 , that at the same time locates the synchronization transition of system ( [ map2a])-([map2b ] ) both for bernoulli and tent map .    to check our results , we introduce the synchronization error @xmath30 , where @xmath31 denotes an average over time and initial conditions .",
    "numerical results , obtained also for other maps described later on , were averaged over typically @xmath32 runs with different initial conditions .",
    "each run has a length @xmath33 steps with @xmath34 steps discarded as initial transient . in some cases , where fluctuations were strong or relaxation time was very long we made runs of @xmath35 steps with @xmath33 steps discarded .",
    "results of the numerical calculations for @xmath9 are shown in fig .",
    "[ steady2 ] .",
    "they confirm that our system ( [ map2a])-([map2b ] ) synchronizes at @xmath36 both for bernoulli and tent maps .",
    "let us notice , however , a difference in the behavior of these two maps .",
    "namely , while for tent map @xmath37 vanishes continuously to zero at @xmath38 it has a discontinuous jump for bernoulli map , although @xmath12 vanishes continuously to zero in this case .",
    "now , let us consider the case of nonidentical systems , i.e. , @xmath39 . in this case",
    "the jacobian for the bernoulli map has the form @xmath40 its diagonalization gives the following lyapunov exponents @xmath41 \\label{lyap2}\\ ] ] for @xmath9 elementary calculations show that now for @xmath42 as before @xmath11 remains positive .",
    "since our systems are now nonidentical , the difference @xmath18 never vanishes and neglecting matrices @xmath19 and @xmath20 is this time only an approximation .",
    "but we expect that for small @xmath43 and in the partially synchronized state this approximation should be relatively accurate .",
    "thus , we assume that eq .",
    "( [ lyap2 ] ) gives approximate lyapunov exponents at least inside partially synchronized phase .",
    "hence eq .",
    "( [ where ] ) locates the partial synchronization transition also for tent map .",
    "numerical calculations of @xmath37 as a function of @xmath44 are shown in fig .",
    "[ steady2 ] . as expected , @xmath37 remains positive even for @xmath45 although for tent map there is a clear change of behavior around @xmath46 .",
    "for bernoulli map",
    "@xmath37 seems to be a smooth function of @xmath44 even at @xmath46 .",
    "recently , it was shown that partial synchronization in some continuous dynamical systems manifests through changes in the probability distribution of the phase difference  @xcite . to check whether this is more general property we calculated probability distribution of the synchronization error @xmath47 and the results",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ binbertent ] .",
    "one can see that in the nonsynchronized phase of both tent and bernoulli map @xmath47 has a rather broad and smooth distribution .",
    "however , for tent map at @xmath48 this distribution becomes very complex .",
    "this complexity persists also in the synchronized phase ( @xmath45 ) . on the other hand",
    ", there is no noticeable difference at @xmath48 for the bernoulli map , although it develops a pronounced peak in the synchronized phase .",
    "taking into account also the smooth behavior of @xmath37 at @xmath48 it is legitimate to ask whether partial synchronization in the case of bernoulli map is a sharp and well defined transition or it is rather a smooth crossover . in this context",
    "it would be desirable to examine a map that continuously interpolates between these two maps as for example a skewed tent map .",
    "as a next example let us consider a three - dimensional map of the form    @xmath49    as before , lyapunov exponents for the bernoulli map are obtained from the eigenvalues of the following matrix @xmath50 and similarly to the @xmath51 case , for @xmath10 and in the synchronized phase , matrix @xmath52 contains also lyapunov exponents of tent map ( in the synchronized state all three variables are the same ) .    for @xmath10",
    "we obtain that the largest exponent @xmath11 is always positive .",
    "two other exponents are degenerate @xmath53 , their eigenvectors are the base of a two - dimensional transversal manifold , and for @xmath9 they vanish at @xmath54 .",
    "numerical calculation of the synchronization error show ( see fig .",
    "[ tent3 ] ) that at this point , as expected , synchronization transition takes place .",
    "similarly to @xmath51 map , for bernoulli map this transition is discontinuous .    for nonidentical systems ( @xmath55 )",
    "we find that @xmath56 vanishes at @xmath57 . on similar grounds as in the @xmath51 case",
    ", we consider it also as an approximate location of the partial synchronization transition in the tent map .",
    "figure  [ tent3 ] confirms this argument since one can see that synchronization error @xmath37 for tent map indeed changes its behavior very close to this point . for bernoulli map @xmath37 seems to be again a smooth function around @xmath46 .",
    "but there is yet another transversal exponent , namely @xmath12 ( with the eigenvector @xmath58=(0,1,-1 ) ) that vanishes as in the @xmath10 case i.e. , at @xmath59 . at this point",
    "complete synchronization of @xmath60 and @xmath61 systems takes place ( they are identical ) . at this point",
    "@xmath37 has a jump but only for bernoulli map .",
    "we also examined the probability distribution @xmath62 .",
    "our results ( not shown ) indicate that for tent map @xmath47 has a complex structure in the synchronized phase ( @xmath45 ) . on the other hand",
    "no appreciable change is seen for bernoulli map which is similar to the @xmath51 case that we already discussed .",
    "it suggests that for discontinuous maps there are almost no indications of a qualitative change at partial synchronization ( except of the vanishing lyapunov exponent ) and most likely it is only a smooth crossover .",
    "as a final example let us consider a four - dimensional map of the form    @xmath63    this map describes a coupling of four identical systems @xmath64 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath65 . increasing @xmath44 increases the coupling @xmath66 and @xmath67 and for sufficiently large @xmath44 the system enters a synchronized state were @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "numerical coefficients in this map are chosen in such a way that subsystems @xmath70 and @xmath71 remain nonsynchronized and chaotic .",
    "lyapunov exponents for the bernoulli map are obtained from the eigenvalues of the following matrix @xmath72 diagonalizing @xmath73 we find that two lyapunov exponents @xmath74 $ ] and @xmath75 $ ] are always positive",
    ". corresponding eigenvectors @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the base of the synchronized subspace ( on which @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) .",
    "there are also two transversal exponents @xmath78 $ ] and @xmath79 $ ] with eigenvectors @xmath80 and @xmath81 . for @xmath9",
    "one can see that @xmath82 at @xmath83 and @xmath84 at @xmath85 .",
    "one can thus expect that the system synchronizes when the largest transversal exponent vanishes i.e. , at @xmath83 .",
    "indeed , such a behavior is seen for the bernoulli map ( fig .",
    "[ tent4 ] ) . in this case",
    "one can also see a jump in @xmath37 at @xmath86 that is a trace of vanishing of @xmath87 .",
    "however , for tent map a different behavior is seen , and synchronization takes place around @xmath88 .    to explain such a behavior we have to notice that the synchronized manifold is in this case two dimensional and in the synchronized state the system is described by two variables e.g. , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "it means that in the synchronized state the difference @xmath91 does not vanish .",
    "consequently , arguments of maps ( [ map4a])-([map4d ] ) might differ and we have to take into account that in some cases jacobian of the map has a different form than @xmath73 .",
    "for example , when arguments of the first two maps ( [ map4a])-([map4b ] ) are both smaller than @xmath14 and arguments of maps ( [ map4c])-([map4d ] ) are both larger than @xmath14 , then the jacobian is given by the following matrix @xmath92 in the following , similarly to the @xmath51 and 3 cases , we will analyse the stability of the synchronized state . when differences @xmath18 and @xmath93 are negligibly small then arguments of maps ( [ map4a ] ) and ( [ map4b ] ) are almost the same , and arguments of maps ( [ map4c ] ) and ( [ map4d ] ) are also almost the same .",
    "thus , the situation is analogous to the @xmath51 example and there are only four possible forms of the jacobian given by the matrices @xmath73 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "however , since @xmath73 and @xmath97 do not commute with @xmath94 and @xmath98 finding lyapunov exponents of our map even under such a simplifying assumption is very difficult . but",
    "a closer look at the spectral properties of these matrices reveals certain interesting properties ( with respect to their spectrum , it is of course sufficient to examine for example only matrices @xmath73 and @xmath94 ) .",
    "calculating eigenvalues of @xmath94 one finds the following lyapunov exponents : @xmath99 $ ] , @xmath100 $ ] .",
    "these lyapunov exponents are associated only with matrix @xmath94 and they are not lyapunov exponents of map ( [ map4a])-([map4d ] ) .",
    "exponents @xmath101 and @xmath102 are positive and their eigenvectors are within the synchronized manifold .",
    "eigenvectors of exponents @xmath103 and @xmath104 are within the transversal manifold .",
    "these exponents change sign at @xmath105 , that for @xmath9 equals @xmath106 , i.e. , the value that is very close to the actual transition in the tent map as obtained numerically ( fig  [ tent4 ] ) .",
    "however , for such a value of @xmath44 only one of the transversal exponents of @xmath73 is negative ( @xmath87 ) and the other ( @xmath56 ) remains positive . but for @xmath107 and interesting property of matrix @xmath73 holds namely @xmath108 .",
    "it suggests that indeed , at this value a synchronization transition of the tent map might take place , however a closer look into the dynamics of our map ( [ map4a])-([map4d ] ) is needed .",
    "let us analyse the dynamics of our system for @xmath109 as projected on the transversal manifold .",
    "each state vector @xmath110 is decomposed in the base of eigenvectors of @xmath73 as @xmath111 , and then we look at the evolution of transversal coordinates @xmath112 and @xmath113 . a typical trajectory is shown in fig .  [ saddle ] .",
    "one can see that after an initial transient , the system locates essentially on the axes of eigenvectors and gradually approaches the point ( 0,0 ) i.e. , a synchronized state , swapping from time to time its coordinates .",
    "actually , such a behavior can be deduced from eqs .",
    "( [ map4a])-([map4d ] ) .",
    "first , we express coordinates in the transversal subspace as @xmath114 and @xmath115 , where @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "since @xmath118 are small it implies that the system evolves in pairs. namely , either both arguments of maps ( [ map4a])-([map4b ] ) are smaller or both are larger than @xmath14 and either the first or the second definition of the tent map ( [ tent ] ) is applied to this pair .",
    "the same applies for the second pair of maps ( [ map4c])-([map4d ] ) .",
    "the swap of coordinates appears when two pairs evolve according to different rules .",
    "indeed , let us assume for example that the first pair of arguments is smaller and the second pair is larger than @xmath14 . using the evolution equations ( [ map4a])-([map4d ] ) we find that initial coordinates ( @xmath119 ) are transformed into ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "up to the sign and the multiplicative factor of the order of unity this is indeed the swap of coordinates . since for @xmath109",
    "the sum of transversal exponents @xmath121 , shrinking along @xmath122 axis prevails over repelling along @xmath123 axis . without swapping",
    "the system would drift to infinity along @xmath123 axis . but swapping turns the system back almost on the @xmath122 axis where it is subjected ( mainly ) to shrinking .",
    "of course , swapping can also put the system again on the @xmath123 axis where it is repelled , but sooner or later it will return on the @xmath122 axis , where it will be again subjected to shrinking .",
    "swapping of coordinates is actually described by matrices @xmath94 or @xmath98 . for @xmath109",
    "these matrices have negative transversal exponents and their action in the transversal manifold can only shrink the system toward the origin ( 0,0 ) . as a result of this combined action ( swapping and shrinking faster than repelling ) , the system must end up in the synchronized state . on the other hand for @xmath124 both mechanisms which attracted the system toward the synchronized state fail . repelling along @xmath123 axis prevails over shrinking along along @xmath122",
    "axis and transversal exponents of @xmath94 and @xmath98 are positive . as a result",
    "the system remains in the nonsynchronized state .",
    "the value @xmath125 ( for @xmath9 ) is indicated in fig .  [ tent4 ] with an arrow and is in a very good agreement with numerical calculations .",
    "there is , however , a silent assumption in the above considerations , namely that on the way to the synchronized state the system will not fall into the basin of another attractor that might possibly exist .",
    "actually , it is already known that basins of synchronized chaotic attractors are sometimes riddled with basins of some other attractors , even when transversal lyapunov exponents are negative  @xcite . as a result",
    ", only some initial conditions will lead the system to the synchronized state , and the other will lead to the other nonsynchronized attractor . and indeed , we found that for @xmath126 such a scenario most likely takes place ( fig .",
    "[ tent4a135 ] ) . for @xmath126",
    "we obtain that the synchronized state becomes stable for @xmath127 .",
    "although the synchronization error @xmath37 does not vanish at this point , we observed that for @xmath128 there is a finite fraction @xmath129 of initial conditions that leads relatively fast to the synchronized state .",
    "remaining initial conditions lead the system to another chaotic attractor . as a result ,",
    "@xmath37 that is an average over runs with different initial conditions , remains positive .    to show that @xmath126 and @xmath130 cases are qualitatively different we plot attractors at their critical points @xmath105 as projected on the transversal manifold @xmath131 ( fig .",
    "[ attractor ] ) .",
    "these plots are obtained from several independent runs after discarding @xmath35 steps and recording next @xmath132 steps .",
    "we noticed , that when @xmath44 is smaller than @xmath46 no appreciable change is seen in the structure of these attractors .",
    "however , when @xmath44 exceeds even slightly the critical value important differences takes place .",
    "namely for @xmath130 the attractor shrinks to the origin ( 0,0 ) . for @xmath126",
    "the origin also becomes an attractor but the nonsynchronized attractors persist as well , with only small changes . in fig .",
    "[ tent4a135 ] probability @xmath129 of reaching a synchronized state seems to be positive only for @xmath128 , which might be a consequence of the numerical method .",
    "namely we considered that a system reached a synchronized state if after @xmath34 steps its coordinates satisfy @xmath133 .",
    "but close to the critical poind @xmath46 an approach to the synchronized state is very slow and we expect that when larger number of iteration steps were used , we would find positive @xmath129 for any @xmath134 .",
    "let us also notice that the fact that for @xmath130 at the critical point the attractor is different than the origin implies a finite value of synchronization error @xmath37 at this point i.e. , the synchronization transition is most likely discontinuous in this case .    finally , let us notice that in synchronization of some spatially extended systems , like coupled - map lattices , it was observed that in presence of negative transversal lyapunov exponents nonsynchronized state might exist  @xcite .",
    "a similar behavior appears in some other extended systems and is known as stable chaos  @xcite . in our opinion , the behavior of our system for @xmath126 bears some similarity to this effect .",
    "although we did not calculate the transversal lyapunov exponents explicitly , it seems very likely that for @xmath134 they are negative ( since the synchronized state is stable , and that is also confirmed numerically because a finite fraction of initial conditions leads to this state ) .",
    "nevertheless , a finite fraction of initial conditions lead the system to a nonsynchronized state .",
    "an important difference is that in extended systems exhibiting stable chaos a nonsynchronized state is a generic state of the dynamics , that is reached from almost any initial condition .",
    "another property of such extended systems is that a nonsynchronized state after a certain threshold looses its stability but no such a threshold was found in our 4-dimensional map .",
    "but it might be that these features are consequences of high dimensionality of dynamics of an extended system .",
    "in conclusion , we studied synchronization of low - dimensional linear chaotic maps . even for such simple maps finding",
    "lyapunov exponents might be very difficult .",
    "but as we have shown , the problem significantly simplifies in the synchronized phase which enabled us to locate exactly the synchronization transitions .",
    "our results show qualitative differences between the behavior of bernoulli and tent map concerning the type of the synchronization transition ( discontinuous for bernoulli map , and continuous for tent map ) , or even the location of the transition ( in the @xmath1 case ) .",
    "morever , very different behavior is seen when maps are nonidentical and only partial synchronization takes place",
    ". it might be that it is a discontinuity of the bernoulli map that is responsible for some of these differences .",
    "noting the similarity to the behavior of some extended systems , it would be interesting to examine whether the origin of the stable chaos indeed can be relateded with riddled basins of attractors in low - dimensional systems like those examined in the present work .    this work was partially supported by the swiss national science foundation and the project ofes 00 - 0578 `` cosyc of sens '' .",
