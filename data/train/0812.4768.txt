    "dephasing , the loss of coherence in wavefunction , is an important phenomenon in mesoscopic systems .",
    "it is the phenomenon that distinguishes the microscopic where full quantum coherence is the rule and the macroscopic where there is no trace left of the quantum phase . in the intermediate mesoscopic regime ,",
    "its effect is important .",
    "it is either due to the collisions with the other electrons and phonons , which can be adjusted by temperature or it can be influenced by external factors @xcite .",
    "several models have been proposed for modelling the dephasing effects , coherent absorption , wave attenuation@xcite , introducing random phase fluctuations in the scattering matrix@xcite are a few .",
    "one of the oldest models is the fictitious probe model of bttiker.@xcite this model has been applied into several different problems .",
    "also , it has been changed as a model to overcome some of its deficiencies ; for example momentum randomization is eliminated and pure coherence effects are brought to front@xcite and long stub model is applied for satisfying the charge conservation requirement for time dependent currents.@xcite ( but the stub model is introduced earlier ) .",
    "the model can be justified based on microscopic theory.@xcite they are also generalized to the continuous case where infinite probes are distributed continuously over the conductor@xcite .    in this contribution , we are going to propose another model based on bttiker s fictitious probe model where infinite probes are distributed continuously over the conductor.the inelastic scatterers are modelled in terms of a scattering matrix with a coupling parameter d , which sets the strength of the decoherence introduced .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present this continuous model in order to get the conductance of a one - dimensional conductor . in the next section",
    "we define the discrete model and after that section the continuum version of it and numerical procedure is given.the last section is devoted to our results and conclusions .",
    "we are interested in extending bttiker s model for decoherence in 1d transport in a way that decoherence proceeds at every location .",
    "the geometry of the problem is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geofprob ] .",
    "here there is a conductor along which electrons move and scatter .",
    "apart from that , @xmath0 additional probes are also placed for modelling the decoherence effects on the main conductor .",
    "it is assumed that the electrons can jump between the conductor and the probes .",
    "it can go to equilibrium in those probes but will eventually return back and at the end coherence with the wavefunction in the main conductor will be lost .        in order to describe the possible states of the electrons , the state of electron at position @xmath1 on the main conductor",
    "is denoted by @xmath2 and the state when the electron is on probe-@xmath3 at the position @xmath4 will be denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "any state @xmath6 can be expressed as a superposition of these as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the wavefunction on the main conductor and @xmath9 is the wavefunction on probe-@xmath3 .",

    "the term in the hamiltonian of the form @xmath23 handles this .",
    "the hermitian conjugate handles the opposite process , namely jumping from probe-@xmath3 to the main conductor .    here",
    "@xmath15 could have been chosen complex valued , but this is unnecessary since it does not introduce any new effects . moreover",
    ", the reality implies a simple time - reversal operation ( complex conjugation of wavefunction ) and the symmetry implies that the scattering matrix is symmetric .    the schrdinger s equation",
    ", @xmath24 can be expressed in terms of wavefunctions as @xmath25 where we assume that the potential on the main conductor , @xmath10 , is constant outside a certain interval . @xmath26",
    "where between the points @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath10 varies .",
    "the scattering region and the points @xmath21 are contained in this interval .",

    "@xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are reflection and transmission amplitudes and we have @xmath64 due to the symmetry of the scattering matrix .",
    "green functions can be expressed in terms of these solutions , @xmath65 .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "( [ eq_psimain ] ) , the term containing the green function can have only outgoing waves if @xmath66 is used .",
    "in that case , all incoming waves should appear in @xmath51 .",
    "as a result we have @xmath67 .    since @xmath68 depends on @xmath69 , we need to solve this equation . to simplify the notation we first define @xmath70 as @xmath71 and",
    "note that @xmath70 depends only on incoming wave amplitudes .",
    "using this , we get the following set of @xmath0 equations , @xmath72 let us now define an @xmath73 matrix @xmath74 as @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",

    "it may be shown that the inverse of @xmath79 can be written as @xmath80 where @xmath81      we look at the behavior of @xmath8 for @xmath82 .",
    "@xmath83 therefore we have @xmath84 for @xmath85 we get @xmath86 the equations ( [ eq_bj1],[eq_bj2 ] ) give the outgoing amplitudes at the probes as follows @xmath87 finally , @xmath88 depends only on the incoming wave amplitudes through @xmath89    from these expressions we can read off the scattering matrix elements as follows .",

    "these two directions are entirely equivalent for scattering .",
    "therefore if an inversion is taken on probe-@xmath3 ( i.e. , @xmath3 is switch with @xmath94 ) then the scattering matrix should remain invariant . this symmetry can be seen in the expressions above .",
    "for example , for the scattering between two different probes @xmath3 and @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) , the scattering amplitude is @xmath97 independent of the directions the wave comes and goes .",
    "if a wave coming from probe-@xmath3 is scattered back into the same probe ( perhaps through passing to the main conductor ) then the transmission amplitude is @xmath98 and the reflection amplitude is @xmath99    note also that the @xmath100-matrix has to be unitary .",
    "an interesting question is this : which properties should the @xmath79 matrix satisfy so that the resultant @xmath100-matrix is unitary ?",
    "it appears that the following equations @xmath101 which are also satisfied by @xmath102 and @xmath103 , are the only ones we need . from here",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath79-matrix and its inverse satisfy @xmath104 unitarity of @xmath100-matrix follows from these .",

    "we assume that both directions on the probes are at the same potential @xmath110 .",

    "also , all the potentials @xmath118 can be shifted by a constant amount , @xmath119 , and this does not change the value of currents . due to this we can choose one of the potentials ( such as @xmath109 ) to be 0 ( grounding ) .    since probes are only imaginary , we require them to carry no current , @xmath120 . in this way , if electrons go into one of these probes , same number of electrons come back .",
    "in this way , particles do not disappear on the average on the main conductor .",
    "in that case we have @xmath121 , the current passing from the device .",
    "we suppose that @xmath122 and express all other potentials in terms of @xmath108 .",

    "we are now going to pass from the discrete model solved above to a continuum model where the probes are infinite in number and they are distributed uniformly to every position .",
    "still , we may want to keep a finite range for the positions where these probes are in contact with the main conductor .",
    "for this reason , we suppose that the region where decoherence occurs is on the interval between positions @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",

    "similarly the inverse of @xmath79 function can be expressed as @xmath172 where @xmath173 the reflection amplitudes can also be expressed in the same form .",
    "the transmission probabilities are @xmath174 it is good that the probabilities turn out to be proportional to the interval length ( note that the probe-@xmath3 takes care of the decoherence on an interval with length @xmath134 ) .",
    "the transmission between two different intervals @xmath175 is also proportional to both of the lengths of the corresponding intervals .",
    "next , note that @xmath176 the matrix elements of @xmath125 becomes @xmath177 this matrix looks different from @xmath79 in the way it contains interval lengths .",
