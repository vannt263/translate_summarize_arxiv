    "interfacing static quantum bit registers and quantum communication channels is at the focus of current research efforts aiming at the realization of quantum networks . for implementing static qubits ,",
    "trapped ions are known to be promising candidates as they provide optimum conditions for quantum information processing : they offer long coherence times for information storage @xcite , are easily manipulated coherently , and their coulomb interaction can be utilized to realize quantum logic gates @xcite .",
    "single photons , on the other hand , are well suited for transmitting quantum information over long distances @xcite .",
    "hence , ion traps may constitute the nodes of a quantum network , while communication between remote nodes may be achieved through photonic channels transmitting quantum states and entanglement  @xcite .",
    "several experiments have recently addressed the realization of an atom - photon qubit interface and its basic components .",
    "studies were performed with various systems , including atom - cavity devices @xcite , atomic ensembles @xcite , and single trapped atoms or ions @xcite . with these latter systems ,",
    "the reported experimental progress comprises : single - photon interference between two ions in the same trap and continuously excited by a laser @xcite , interference between photons emitted by two atoms in distinct traps under pulsed laser - excitation @xcite , two - photon interference in single - ion fluorescence under continuous excitation @xcite , and finally two - photon interference between two ions confined in remote traps excited by short laser pulses @xcite .",
    "the latter experiments have very recently lead to the demonstration of remote entanglement between the two independently trapped ions @xcite .",
    "entanglement between two remotely trapped atomic systems can be established through single- or two - photon interference . in the first case , two indistinguishable scattering paths of a single photon interfere , such that its detection leads to entanglement of the atoms @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "coincident detection of two photons , each being entangled with one atom @xcite , projects the two atoms into an entangled state @xcite .",
    "a detailed comparison of the two methods is found in @xcite .    as originally shown by hong , ou and mandel @xcite , two indistinguishable photons impinging simultaneously on two input ports of a beam splitter show photon coalescence ,",
    "i.e.  both photons will leave the beam splitter in the same output mode .",
    "indistinguishability of the input photons is then marked by a vanishing coincidence rate between the two output ports , corresponding to the generation of two - photon states .",
    "the contrast of two - photon interference is reduced , however , when the spatial or temporal overlap of the incident photon wave packets is only partial , such that the photons become distinguishable @xcite .    in the experiments reported here",
    "we study the conditions to achieve entanglement between distant atoms with two promising systems , ba@xmath0 and ca@xmath0 ions .",
    "we observe and characterize quantum interference between photons emitted by two ions of the same species which are independently trapped in different vacuum chambers , approximately one meter apart . under continuous laser excitation ,",
    "resonance fluorescence photons are collected in single - mode optical fibers and overlapped at two input ports of a beam splitter . at the output ports , correlations among photon detection events",
    "are evaluated .",
    "controlling the polarization at the beam splitter inputs , we observe high - contrast two - photon interference .",
    "recorded correlations allow us to quantify the coherence of the single - ion resonance fluorescence under continuous excitation .",
    "to realize the experiments , we developed a new assembly which integrates a linear paul trap and two high - numerical - aperture laser objectives ( halo lenses ) .",
    "the diffraction - limited lenses are mounted inside the vacuum vessels on opposite sides of the trap ; their positions are individually controlled by 3-axes piezo - mechanical actuators and allow us to collect up to 8@xmath1 of the total fluorescence ( 4 @xmath1 with each lens ) .",
    "the principal components of the experimental set - up are described in the following .      each custom - designed objective for collecting the fluorescent light",
    "covers a numerical aperture of na=0.4 with a focal length of 25 mm , thus collecting @xmath2 of the total solid angle .",
    "the objectives are designed to be diffraction limited over a wide spectral range from ultraviolet to near infrared .",
    "the back focal length varies between 13.7 mm ( @xmath3400 nm ) and 15.1 mm ( @xmath3870 nm ) , leaving several millimetres of space between the radio frequency electrodes of the ion trap and the front surface of the objective .",
    "these consist of four lenses which are all anti - reflection coated for the respective wavelengths ( barium : 493 nm , 650 nm , 1762 nm ; calcium : 397 nm , 422 nm , 850 - 866 nm ) .",
    "the calculated transmission of each halo objective is for calcium : @xmath4 ( 850 - 866 nm ) , 87.5% ( @729 nm ) , 97.2% ( @422 nm ) , 95.7% ( @397 nm ) ; for barium 97% ( @650 nm ) , 98% ( @493 nm ) .",
    "the objectives are mounted on vacuum compatible slip - stick piezo translation stages , ( attocube _ xyz_-positioner , anpxyz 100 ) .",
    "these exhibit a travel of 5 mm and 400 nm step size which allows us to maximize the collection efficiency of emitted resonance fluorescence and to address single ions individually when loading the trap with a string of ions .",
    "the objectives have been characterised by various methods : for the first batch of objectives , of which one is used in the barium experimental setup , the manufacturer characterised the wavefront aberrations with a zygo interferometer to be smaller than @xmath5 at 493 nm .",
    "interference experiments proved this precision by obtaining single - ion self - interference with a @xmath6 visibility @xcite .",
    "the second batch of objectives was characterised using a wavefront sensor which showed a root mean square aberration of 0.073@xmath7 at 670 nm for three consecutive halo lenses , measured over @xmath8 of the aperture as depicted in fig .",

    "both lasers are locked via transfer cavities to a reference laser , which itself is stabilized to an atomic  cesium  line via doppler - free absorption spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "excitation parameters , e.g. laser intensities and frequencies , are set to maximize the count rate of the fluorescence light while maintaining sufficient laser cooling .",
    "fluorescence photons from both ions are collected using the previously described halo lenses and then coupled into the two input ports of a single - mode fiber beam splitter .",
    "a polarizer before the input coupler projects onto horizontal polarization .",
    "thereafter , fiber polarization controllers give full and independent control over the polarizations arriving at the two beam splitter inputs .",
    "the use of a fiber beam splitter instead of a free - space setup ensures optimum spatial overlap of the photon wave - packets at the beam splitter .",

    "fluorescence photons emitted on the @xmath27 to @xmath28 electronic transition are expressed in terms of pauli lowering operators , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , for ion 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "these are associated with the creation of a single photon . without any loss of generality",
    "we assume that @xmath29 transforms the field into @xmath31 polarization such that @xmath32 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote unit vectors in @xmath31 and @xmath33 directions , respectively . in the previous expressions ,",
    "let us note that the source free part of the input fields has been neglected since noise contributions play a minor role in our experiments @xcite .",
    "for an ideal 50/50 beam - splitter the transmission ( @xmath34 ) and reflection ( @xmath35 ) coefficients obey @xmath36 @xcite . therefore , field operators at the output arms read    @xmath37\\vec e_x+[i\\sin\\phi \\hat\\sigma^-_2(t)]\\vec e_y\\big\\ }   \\nonumber\\\\ \\widehat e_4(t)&= & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt2}\\big\\ { [ i\\hat\\sigma^-_1(t)e^{i\\psi}+\\cos\\phi \\hat\\sigma^-_2(t)]\\vec e_x+[\\sin\\phi \\hat\\sigma^-_2(t)]\\vec e_y\\big\\},\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath38 represents a random phase between the fields emitted by the two ions .",

    "it is obtained by blocking one fiber entrance and it shows almost ideal anti - bunching ( @xmath60=0.03 with no background subtraction ) and an optical nutation , @xmath68=2.9 .    figure [ fig4 ] shows experimental results obtained for @xmath57=0 such that photons impinging at the two input ports of the beam - splitter are indistinguishable .",
    "as expected , the normalized number of coincidences strongly drops around @xmath64=0 which signals two - photon interference @xcite . from the measured values of @xmath69 and @xmath70",
    "we deduce that the two - photon interference contrast reaches 89(2 ) @xmath1 and 80(10 ) @xmath1 for the barium and calcium experiments , respectively . in the latter case ,",
    "the contrast is limited by the time resolution of the photo - detectors .",
    "contrasts are furthermore derived from raw experimental data , without correcting for accidental correlations induced by stray light photons or dark - counts of the photo - detectors .",

    "first , for @xmath64=0 , incident photons are detected simultaneously such that these are fully indistinguishable and therefore the amplitude of two - photon interference is maximal . by contrast , for @xmath710 the degree of indistinguishability of the input photons is characterized by the temporal overlap of their wave - packets .",
    "the length of these wave - packets in fact corresponds to the photon coherence time which then governs the contrast of the interference @xcite .",

    "this reveals that the coherence time of the resonance fluorescence does not exceed 20 ns in our experiments .",
    "this indicates that incoherent scattering is dominant , far longer coherence times would otherwise be observed . as a consequence ,",
    "let us note that the amplitude of the optical nutation is reduced by @xmath73 compared to the non - interfering case ( @xmath74 ) .     for varying polarization angles , @xmath75 .",
    "the solid line shows the @xmath76 dependence of the coincidence rate at @xmath77 as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "experimental results are obtained with the barium experiment .",
    ", width=302 ]    finally , we present in figure [ fig5 ] the number of coincidence counts as a function of the polarization angle , @xmath57 .",
    "thereby the degree of distinguishability of interfering photons , and thus the amplitude of the two - photon interference , is smoothly tuned . from eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , one expects a @xmath78= \\frac{1}{2}\\sin^2\\phi$ ] dependence .",
    "the latter is represented by a solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , in good agreement with our experimental findings .",
    "in summary , we have observed high contrast interference between resonance fluorescence photons emitted by remotely trapped ions . large photon detection efficiency is reached by means of high numerical aperture halo - lenses placed inside the vacuum vessels .",
    "these allow us to reach detection count rates in a single - mode as high as 25 - 30 and 10 - 15 kcps / s for the barium and calcium experiment respectively .",
    "the discripancy arises from different fiber coupling efficiency and photo - detectors quantum efficiency at 493 and 397 nm .",
