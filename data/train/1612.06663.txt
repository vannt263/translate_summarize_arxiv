    "graphene , the monolayer two - dimensional carbon crystal , grants a possibility to study how a many - body system of massless dirac electrons behave in electric and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "one of the most striking manifestations of the `` relativistic '' nature of graphene is the unconventional half - integer quantum hall effect in strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the role of coulomb interaction in graphene in the quantum hall regime is still a debatable and controversial topic @xcite .",
    "landau levels of electrons in graphene have the non - equidistant energies @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the fermi velocity , @xmath2 is the magnetic length ( hereafter we set @xmath3 ) .",
    "contrary to the case of a non - relativistic electron gas , the energies of cyclotron transitions between landau levels in graphene are not protected by kohn s theorem @xcite against interaction induced corrections , as both predicted theoretically @xcite and reported in experimental works @xcite .    the following major signatures of coulomb many - body effects are observed : a ) the energy of @xmath4 or @xmath5 ( referred to as @xmath6 ) cyclotron inter - landau level transitions and that of @xmath7 or @xmath8 transitions ( @xmath9 ) have the ratio deviating from the single - particle prediction @xmath10 @xcite ; b ) the renormalized fermi velocities @xmath11 which characterize the energies of symmetric interband @xmath12 transitions ( referred to as @xmath13 ) measured in magneto - raman scattering @xcite demonstrate significant dependence on magnetic field and on a substrate dielectric constant .",
    "the existing theoretical calculations @xcite of inter - landau level transitions in graphene were carried out in the first order in coulomb interaction , which implies using of the unscreened coulomb interaction in all matrix elements @xcite .",
    "this results in the overestimation of many - body effects in comparison with the experimental data , as noted in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this article",
    ", we calculate the energies of the cyclotron and magneto - raman transitions between landau levels in graphene using the coulomb interaction which is screened in the random - phase approximation in the static limit .",
    "we include exchange self - energy and excitonic contributions to the transition energies , as well as the landau level mixing in the excitonic channel , and fit the experimental data @xcite with our calculations . using the bare fermi velocity @xmath14 and realistic dielectric constants , we have achieved much better agreement with both the magneto - raman @xcite and cyclotron resonance @xcite experiments than in previous attempts of other authors , which had dealt with the unscreened interaction @xcite .",
    "moreover , we find the important role of a self - consistent suppression of the screening due to an upward renormalization of transition energies .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "our theoretical model is introduced in sec .",
    "the results of calculations are presented and the experimental data are fitted in sec .",
    "finally , the conclusions are made in sec .",
    "most theoretical models of coulomb many - body effects in graphene @xcite take into account three major contributions to the inter - landau level transition energies : single - particle exchange self - energies of electron and hole , an excitonic shift due to electron - hole coulomb attraction ( also referred to as a vertex correction ) and an electron - hole exchange energy .",
    "the latter contribution is principal in calculating dispersions of collective magnetoplasmon excitations @xcite , but vanishes for optically excited nearly zero - momentum electron - hole pairs , therefore we will not include it in our calculations .",
    "renormalization of single - particle energy levels is conventionally treated using the hartree - fock approximation and the unscreened coulomb interaction . omitting the hartree term , which affects only electrostatics of a graphene layer , we get the single - particle energy levels @xmath15 shifted due to the fock exchange self - energies ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for the details of calculations ) @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the occupation number of the @xmath18-th landau level ( @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 is the exchange matrix element of the coulomb interaction @xmath21 ; the latter has the form @xmath22 in a surrounding medium with the dielectric constant @xmath23 .",
    "each single - particle state @xmath24 is specified by a landau level number @xmath25 and a guiding center index @xmath26 , when we work in the symmetric gauge .    as known @xcite",
    ", the self - energies ( [ sigma_exch ] ) diverge logarithmically when calculating the sum over the filled landau levels of negative energies , so the cutoff @xmath27 is required in order to obtain finite results .",
    "the value of @xmath28 can be estimated by equating the concentration @xmath29 of electrons on @xmath28 landau levels ( with taking into account the fourfold spin and valley degeneracy @xmath30 ) to that in the filled valence band of intrinsic graphene , @xmath31 : @xmath32}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath33 is the area of graphene elementary cell , @xmath34 . separating the part of ( [ sigma_exch ] ) which diverges in the @xmath35 limit , we get @xmath36    in the weak magnetic field limit @xmath37 , ( [ sigma_exch2 ] ) can be tracked to the well - known form of electron self - energy in graphene in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "the first term of ( [ sigma_exch2 ] ) equals to the large negative constant part of the hartree - fock self - energy @xmath38 @xcite , where @xmath39 is the cutoff momentum .",
    "the second term describes the logarithmic renormalization of the fermi velocity @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the fermi momentum .",
    "thus the exchange self - energies with and without magnetic field have the same cutoff dependencies up to the linear and logarithmic levels . the same result was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by a different method",
    ".      an excitonic energy shift due to coulomb attraction between electron on the @xmath42-th landau level and hole on the @xmath43-th level is often calculated in the first order in coulomb interaction @xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the noninteracting electron - hole ( or magnetoexcitonic ) state at zero momentum .",
    "( [ e_exc ] ) is the simplification of the more general picture , where the mixing of different @xmath46 transitions should occur in the excitonic ladder @xcite . to take it into account",
    ", one must consider the hamiltonian in the basis of noninteracting electron - hole states with the matrix elements given by @xmath47 and find its eigenvalues . here",
    "@xmath48 are the single - particle energies which are already renormalized by coulomb interaction .",
    "our estimates show that it is sufficient to consider only the mixing of @xmath49 and @xmath50 magneto - raman transitions or @xmath6 and @xmath9 cyclotron transitions , and its major effect is a slight increase of the energy distance between these transition lines due to an interlevel repulsion .",
    "the mixing with higher lying transitions has an overall weak effect in the presence of the screening ( although it was estimated to be significant in the absence of the screening at @xmath51 @xcite ) .",
    "polarization of the electron gas in graphene , which can be described in terms of virtual electron - hole pairs , leads to the screening of coulomb interaction .",
    "the screened interaction in the static limit @xmath52 is @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the two - dimensional fourier transform of the unscreened interaction , and @xmath55 is the irreducible polarizability . in the random - phase approximation ,",
    "@xmath56 where @xmath57 are the landau level form factors ( see the details of polarizability calculations in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    introducing the positively valued dimensionless polarizability @xmath58",
    ", we get eq .",
    "( [ v_scr ] ) in the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 the dimensionless parameter @xmath61 is conventionally used to characterize a relative strength of coulomb interaction , but in our approach it appears only as a multiplier of @xmath62 in the denominator of ( [ v_scr1 ] ) and thus characterizes the relative strength of the screening .",
    "the case of unscreened coulomb interaction corresponds to the zeroth order in this parameter , @xmath63 .",
    "the numerically calculated polarizabilities are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] at different integer fillings @xmath64 of landau levels ( @xmath65 in undoped graphene and @xmath66 when the @xmath25-th highest occupied level is completely filled ) .",
    "the functions @xmath67 oscillate at @xmath68 reflecting the nodal structure of landau level wave functions and tend to the polarizability @xcite of undoped graphene without magnetic field @xmath69 at @xmath70 ( see also analysis in @xcite ) . due to the electron - hole symmetry of the dirac model , @xmath62 does not depend on the sign of @xmath64 .",
    "remarkably , the same symmetry makes the polarizability independent on the filling of the 0-th landau level , thus @xmath62 is the same for @xmath65 and @xmath71 , if we neglect intralevel electron transitions .    to improve calculations of the transition energies with taking into account the screening , we replace @xmath21 with ( [ v_scr1 ] ) in the matrix elements of coulomb interaction when",
    "calculate the electron self - energies ( [ sigma_exch ] ) and treat excitonic effects ( [ mixing ] ) : @xmath72 eqs .",
    "( [ pol])([sigma_scr ] ) compose the starting point of our numerical calculations .",
    "the recent experiments @xcite on magneto - raman scattering showing clear signs of coulomb many - body effects were carried out with undoped ( @xmath65 ) graphene on three types of substrate : 1 ) suspended graphene , 2 ) graphene encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn ) , 3 ) graphene on graphite . in each sample , the energies @xmath73 and @xmath74 of two transitions @xmath49 and @xmath50 were measured as functions of magnetic field in the range @xmath75 and then converted to the renormalized fermi velocities @xmath11 .",
    "the latter describe fictitious single - particle landau levels ( [ e_0 ] ) having the same energy difference : @xmath76 .",
    "the experimental points @xmath77 are reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "our many - body calculations of @xmath11 require the bare fermi velocity @xmath78 and the dielectric constant @xmath23 as input parameters .",
    "otherwise , these quantities can be obtained by least square fitting of experimental points .",
    "generally , the best approximations to the experimental data can be achieved by independent adjustment of @xmath78 and @xmath23 for each of six transition lines in fig .",
    "we use more realistic fitting procedure , adjusting separate values of @xmath23 for the pair of transitions @xmath79 in each graphene sample as well as a common @xmath78 for all samples .",
    "our attempts to fit the experimental data in different approximations ( see below ) show that the optimal value of common @xmath78 is about @xmath80 .",
    "smaller or larger values of @xmath78 do not allow us to reproduce the slopes of experimental dependencies of @xmath11 on @xmath81 accurately enough for all samples simultaneously . assuming this @xmath78",
    ", then we adjust the effective dielectric constant @xmath23 for each graphene sample in order to achieve the best least square fit for its pair @xmath79 of transitions . in agreement with the experiment ,",
    "our calculations show that @xmath11 for @xmath50 is always higher than for @xmath49 in the same sample , and dependencies of @xmath11 on @xmath81 are approximately linear .",
    "first , we make the adjustment of @xmath23 using the unscreened interaction , with the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( solid lines ) and table  [ table ] ( first column ) .",
    "the obtained @xmath23 turned out to be too large in comparison with the actual dielectric constants of suspended graphene ( @xmath82 ) and graphene in hbn ( @xmath83 ) because they need to mimic the screening caused by both surrounding medium and graphene electrons . besides , the distance between the @xmath49 and @xmath50 lines is clearly insufficient in this approximation .",
    "the same conclusions was made in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath23 was adjusted to approximate the slopes of experimental dependencies of @xmath11 on @xmath81 and additional fictitious @xmath84 was needed to reproduce the interline distance in each sample .",
    "then we use the statically screened interaction and obtain the fitting results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( dotted lines ) and table  [ table ] ( second column ) .",
    "although we still have insufficient interline distances , the resulting @xmath23 are no longer overestimated with respect to the actual ones , but are even underestimated ( for example , @xmath23 is even unphysically smaller than 1 in the case of suspended graphene ) .",
    "a possible reason is overestimation of the screening in the static limit in comparison with a full dynamical screening .    in order to improve agreement between theory and experiment",
    ", we can make the screening approximately `` self - consistent '' .",
    "indeed , if the renormalized fermi velocity @xmath85 , which describes observable energies of inter - landau level transitions , is 25%65% higher than the bare velocity @xmath14 , then the polarizability @xmath86 should correspondingly be renormalized to lower values due to increased energy denominators in ( [ pol ] ) .",
    "since a full self - consistent treatment of renormalized transition energies in the polarizability would be computationally demanding and beyond the accuracy level of the static random - phase approximation , we resort to a simplified semi - phenomenological approach . we still use the same dimensionless @xmath67 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , which describes qualitative features of the screening , but change the value of the parameter @xmath61 , which determines quantitatively the overall screening strength . for each transition",
    "@xmath13 in each sample , we substitute an averaged ( over the magnetic field range ) value of experimental @xmath11 instead of the bare @xmath78 into the formula ( [ rs ] ) : @xmath87 .",
    "this replacement reduces the resulting @xmath88 and effectively weakens the screening .",
    "the results of this approach are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( solid lines ) and table  [ table ] ( third column ) . increased interline distances provide much better agreement with the experimental data , that indicates importance of a self - consistent treatment of the screening .",
    "we can improve agreement with the experiment even further , if take into account significant change of @xmath89 in the experimental range of magnetic field , which is most noticeable in the case of suspended graphene . in this fourth approximation ,",
    "we assume @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the linear fit to experimental data for the @xmath13 transition .",
