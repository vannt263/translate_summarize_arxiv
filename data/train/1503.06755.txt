    "the propagation of crack has been studied in the realm of linearized elasticity since the seminal work of griffith ( see @xcite ) and led to a lot of realistic applications in engineering . also from a mathematical point of view",
    "the theory is well developed ( see @xcite ) and adopted in many recent works in applied analysis ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a natural framework for the investigation of fracture models in a geometrically linear setting is given by the space of functions of bounded deformation , denoted by @xmath1 , which consists of all functions @xmath2 whose symmetrized distributional derivative @xmath3 is a finite @xmath4-valued radon measure . to study problems in fracture mechanics with variational methods francfort and marigo",
    "@xcite have introduced energy functionals which are essentially of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 .",
    "( for the definition and properties of this space we refer to section [ rig - sec : sub , bd ] below . )",
    "these so - called griffith functionals comprise elastic bulk contributions for the unfractured regions of the body represented by the linear elastic strain @xmath7 and surface terms that assign energy contributions on the crack paths comparable to the size of the crack @xmath8 .",
    "a major difficulty of these problems is given by the fact that there is no control over the skew - symmetric part of the distributional derivative .",
    "indeed , it would be desirable that uniform bounds on induce estimates for the strain @xmath9 or the function @xmath10 itself and that accordingly suitable compactness results can be derived .",
    "however , simple examples ( see e.g. @xcite ) show that such properties can not be inferred in general as the behavior of small pieces being almost or completely separated from the bulk part may not be controlled . on the one hand",
    ", this observation particularly implies that sbd is not contained in sbv .",
    "( for the definition and properties of sbv we refer to @xcite . ) on the other hand , it leads to the natural question if certain estimates still hold ( 1 ) up to a small exceptional set or ( 2 ) after passing to a slightly modified displacement field .",
    "the goal of the work at hand is to show that indeed the distance of the function @xmath10 from an infinitesimal rigid motion can be estimated by an appropriate combination of the energy terms given in .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is the classical korn - poincar inequality in bd ( see @xcite ) stating that there is a constant @xmath11 depending only on the domain @xmath12 such that @xmath13 for all @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a linear projection onto the space of infinitesimal rigid motions and @xmath16 denotes the total variation of the symmetrized distributional derivative .",
    "this is a remarkable result in consideration of the fact that corresponding estimates also involving the absolutely continuous part of the derivative @xmath9 do not hold since korn s inequality fails in bd ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it first appears that the inequality is not adapted for problems of the form as in @xmath17 the jump height is involved and in we only have control over the size of the crack .",
    "however , the main strategy of our approach is to prove that one may indeed find bounds on the jump heights after a suitable modification of the jump set and the displacement field whose total energy almost coincides with the original energy . in particular",
    ", is then applicable and it can be shown that the distance of the modification from an infinitesimal rigid motion can already be controlled in terms of the elastic energy .",
    "the goal of this work is to prove the following korn - poincar - type inequality for sbd@xmath0 functions . for @xmath18 let @xmath19 and by @xmath20 denote the diameter of a rectangle @xmath21 .",
    "[ rig - th : kornpoin * * ] let @xmath22 .",
    "then there is a constant @xmath23 such that for all @xmath24 and all @xmath25 the following holds : we get paraxial rectangles @xmath26 with @xmath27 such that for @xmath28 and the square @xmath29 with @xmath30 we have @xmath31 and @xmath32 for some @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the specific choice @xmath35 shows that the distance from an infinitesimal rigid motion may indeed be controlled exclusively by the elastic part of the energy . as a direct consequence",
    "we obtain a modification @xmath36 with @xmath37 on @xmath38 and @xmath39 for @xmath40 such that the estimate in theorem [ rig - th : kornpoin * * ] still holds . to the best of our knowledge",
    "our korn - poincar inequality differs from other inequalities of this type available in the sbv - setting ( see @xcite ) as it is not based on a truncation of the function ( which is forbidden in the sbd framework ) , but on a modification of the displacement field on an exceptional set @xmath41 .",
    "this set is associated to the parts of @xmath42 being detached from the bulk part of @xmath42 by @xmath43 . in contrast to the recently established estimate in @xcite , theorem [ rig - th : kornpoin * * ] provides an exceptional set with a rather simple geometry . in particular",
    ", we have control over @xmath44 which allows to apply compactness results for gsbd functions ( see @xcite ) .    in revising the present contribution",
    "let us also mention that after submission of the original version of this article , similar inequalities @xcite in a planar setting occurred also providing a bound on the perimeter of an exceptional set .",
    "in contrast to these results our modification technique allows to obtain a very fine estimate on the sum of the diameter of the rectangles if in we choose @xmath45 for given small @xmath46 .",
    "in fact , also in related questions concerning the approximation of sbd functions ( see e.g. @xcite ) it turned out that the derivation of sharp estimates for the surface energy is a particularly challenging problem",
    ". the bound in will be fundamental in the rigidity estimates in @xcite , where based on theorem [ rig - th : kornpoin * * ] we construct a modification whose crack length essentially coincides with the surface energy of the original displacement field .",
    "apart from we also provide a trace estimate for a modification @xmath47 of @xmath10 on the boundary @xmath48 ( see section [ rig - sec : subsub , modalg2 ] below ) , i.e. we do not only control the length of @xmath48 , but also the jump height of @xmath47 along @xmath48 .",
    "this byproduct of our main result is ( 1 ) again essential in @xcite to estimate the fracture energy and ( 2 ) a basic ingredient for the derivation of a korn - type inequality in sbd @xcite .",
    "we comment that the original motivation for establishing theorem [ rig - th : kornpoin * * ] was the investigation of quantitative geometric rigidity results in sbd and the derivation of linearized griffith energies from nonlinear models ( see @xcite ) generalizing the results in nonlinear elasticity theory ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) to the framework of brittle materials . nevertheless , we believe that this inequality is of independent interest and may contribute to solve related problems in the future , especially concerning fracture models in the realm of linearized elasticity which are related to problems in sbv where poincar inequalities ( see @xcite ) have proved to be useful .",
    "moreover , although similarly as other results in this context ( see @xcite ) theorem [ rig - th : kornpoin * * ] provides an estimate only for functions with small jump sets , the modification technique presented in this article is adapted for problems involving functions with possibly large jump sets ( see @xcite ) where arguments based on slicing are not expedient .",
    "the derivation of our main result is very involved as apart from the fact that the body may be disconnected by the jump set one has to face the problems that e.g. ( 1 ) the body might be still connected but only in a small region where the elastic energy is possibly large , ( 2 ) the crack geometry might become extremely complex including highly oscillating crack paths , ( 3 ) there might be infinite crack patterns occurring on different scales .",
    "the common difficulty of all these phenomena is the possible high irregularity of the jump set whence there are no uniform bounds for the constant in .",
    "therefore , our proof is based on a modification algorithm which analyzes the problem iteratively on regions of mesoscopic size gradually becoming larger . in each step",
    "we have to carefully balance the elastic and surface contributions as well as the crack geometry and decide whether to establish an estimate for the function using or to alter the jump set .",
    "although we in principle believe that the main strategy and a lot of techniques can be employed to treat the problem in arbitrary space dimension , we only prove the result in a planar setting in order to avoid even more technical difficulties concerning the topological structure of the crack geometries occurring in @xmath49 .",
    "as the proof of theorem [ rig - th : kornpoin * * ] is very technical and long , we give a short overview and highlight the principal proof strategies for convenience of the reader at the end of this introduction .",
    "the rest of the paper is then organized as follows . in section",
    "[ rig - sec : 1 ] we present the main modification results and show that theorem [ rig - th : kornpoin * * ] may be derived herefrom .",
    "section [ rig - sec : sub , neigh ] is devoted to a fine investigation of the crack geometry in the neighborhood of a jump component which is the starting point for the derivation of a trace estimate . in section [ rig - sec : sub , proof kornpoin ] we then present a modification algorithm which iteratively modifies the jump set such that the estimates on the jump height may be applied .",
    "section [ rig - sec : proofs ] and section [ rig - sec : sub , trace bc ] contain the proofs of the technical results .",
    "finally , in appendix [ rig - sec : appe ] we provide some auxiliary estimates including an analysis for the constant of the korn - poincar inequality in bd ( see ) for varying domains and a trace theorem in sbd which allows to control the @xmath50-norm of the functions on the boundary . here",
    "we also give a list of frequently used notation .",
    "we give an outline of the principal proof ideas .",
    "* ( a ) * first , by approximation of @xmath51 we can assume that the jump set can be covered by a finite number of rectangles ( see theorem [ th : sbd dense ] and the proof of theorem [ rig - th : kornpoin**xxxx ] ) .",
    "the boundary of these sets , called _ boundary components _ in the following , will be altered during an iterative procedure and we measure their length by a convex combination of the hausdorff - measure @xmath52 and the ` diameter ' defined by @xmath53 for @xmath54 small , where @xmath55 denotes the boundary component and @xmath56 the orthogonal projections onto the coordinate axes .    *",
    "( b ) * beginning with small components the goal is to derive a trace estimate on each @xmath55 such that replacing the function @xmath10 by an appropriate infinitesimal rigid motion in the interior of the rectangle we get @xmath57 \\sim \\sqrt{|\\gamma|_\\infty\\eps}$ ] on @xmath55 . here",
    "the scaling of @xmath57 $ ] reflects the intuition that the crack opening of small cracks is generically small .",
    "then the estimate in theorem [ rig - th : kornpoin * * ] can be established by .",
    "the fundamental ingredient in the proof is a modification algorithm introduced in section [ rig - sec : subsub , modalg ] which iteratively changes the jump set and determines the trace at boundary components once specific conditions in a neighborhood are fulfilled .",

    "* ( c ) * to derive a trace estimate for @xmath55 we consider a rectangular neighborhood @xmath58 ( see @xmath59 in figure [ 1a ] and section [ rig - sec : subsub , rec - neigh ] ) .",
    "if @xmath60 does not contain other components ( see @xmath59 ) and the elastic energy @xmath61 is bounded by @xmath62 , the property essentially follows by a scaling argument in and a corresponding trace theorem .",
    "likewise , an estimate can be derived if @xmath60 contains only small components @xmath63 , for which @xmath57 \\sim \\sqrt{|\\gamma_l|_\\infty\\eps}$ ] on @xmath64 has already been established and one has @xmath65 ( see @xmath66 ) .",
    "we will even see that the behavior of @xmath10 in @xmath60 is still sufficiently rigid if there are ( at most ) two large components @xmath67 , @xmath68 intersecting @xmath60 and the elastic and surface energy in the two areas close to @xmath69 and @xmath55 , @xmath68 are small enough ( see @xmath70 ) .",
