    "<S> @xcite has been fueled by the amelioration / novel rephrasing of the various hierarchy problems . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the models of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have raised some hopes that upcoming experiments may reveal signatures of the existence of higher dimensions @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the novelty of having phenomenologically consistent four - dimensional gravity in the presence of non - compact higher dimensions has been the main motivation for the investigations of `` warped bulk '' models based on the idea of randall and sundrum @xcite without much motivation from upcoming experimental signature possibilities . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the possible experimental signatures of the model of randall and sundrum of ref.@xcite in the case that the warping scale is sufficiently lowered . since most of the qualitative aspects of this scenario have already been discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , this paper will focus on the details of the experimental signatures .    unlike the non - warped scenarios and some of the variations of the warped model for which the gravity is quasilocalized ( see also @xcite ) , the original warped bulk model of randall and sundrum @xcite ( henceforth referred to as rs ) did not seem to have any low energy phenomenological implications ( perhaps with the exception of black hole physics@xcite ) , mainly because the cosmological constant contribution coming from the constant energy density on the planck brane had always been identified with the string scale for naive naturalness reasons . </S>",
    "<S> ( we will refer to this constant energy density as the rs brane tension . </S>",
    "<S> ) however , as explicitly noted for example by kraus@xcite , if one attempts to identify the rs brane tension with that of a collection of d3 branes , one finds a discrepancy : the d3 brane tension is 2/3 of the brane tension needed for the rs brane tension .    </S>",
    "<S> more recently , a different class of sugra solutions @xcite ( albeit singular ) have been discovered which share the warped bulk spacetime of the rs scenario ( although the noncompact limit has not been explored ) . </S>",
    "<S> even more recently , there has also been progress in embedding the sugra containing the rs solution within a particular compactification of type iib string theory@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one emerging picture is that the rs brane does not correspond to any particular d - brane but is an `` effective geometry '' arising from a combination of a stack of negative tension branes stuck at an orbifold fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the positive quantity that was previously naively identified with the brane tension is not really the brane tension , but is actually a term arising from the combination of the positive curvature from the orbifold fixed point singularity and the negative tension of the branes confined there . in this picture , the rs brane tension is of the order of @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the ads horizon of the rs brane embedding spacetime ( the warping scale ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is given by @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the string scale , @xmath5 is the string coupling , and @xmath6 is the number of d3-branes stacked to form the rs brane . </S>",
    "<S> hence , if @xmath7 is taken large enough , the warping scale can be lowered to @xmath8 mm such that the rs brane tension will be at @xmath9(1 tev ) , which may be a useful scale for model building ( such as for particle / sparticle mass splitting ) . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , given that the cosmological constant scale is @xmath10 , it may not be unreasonable to expect the @xmath11 scale to enter the effective theory . in any case </S>",
    "<S> , the rs model with small warping will predict signatures for the upcoming experiments testing submillimeter behavior of newton s law . </S>",
    "<S> we will refer to this model as the @xmath12 model . </S>",
    "<S> model , our conclusions should easily extend to its generalizations such as that of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . ]    </S>",
    "<S> as is well known , the leading order multiplicative correction to newton s law has a functional behavior of @xmath13 for the rs model at large distances . </S>",
    "<S> hence , one would naively expect this scenario to behave just like that of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( add model ) with two extra dimensions ( n=2 ) , which would imply that there would be collider signatures for the @xmath12 model . on the other hand , as pointed out by ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , this @xmath13 correction becomes @xmath14 at distances much shorter than the ads horizon length of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the @xmath12 model for @xmath15 is effectively add ( n=1 ) , since at large @xmath16 the curvature can be ignored . </S>",
    "<S> hence , at collider distances ( @xmath17 ) , for @xmath18 the corrections from the continuum of kk states do not enhance the gravitational processes sufficiently to cause them to be observable .    </S>",
    "<S> however , it is not clear that there will be absolutely no effects in this case because the brane tension given by is at the collider scale . </S>",
    "<S> it can be argued that since the rs brane is confined to an orbifold fixed point , the brane should not behave as a thick or `` fat '' brane even when the collider energy is above the scale of the brane tension . on the other hand , it is not obvious whether the stacking of such a large number of d - branes is consistent with the orbifold fixed point idealization . </S>",
    "<S> if the brane can fluctuate at the collider scale , the brane tension may serve as a cutoff for the standard model theory confined to the brane and may help solve the hierarchy problem ( in analogy with the lowering of the fundamental scale in the add scenarios ) .    even independently of the string theory picture ( note that the string theory realization of the rs model is not known to be unique ) and assuming somehow that a field theory can be well defined in the presence of orbifold fixed point singularities , the rs brane tension may not always reflect the scale of the tension of the object sitting at the orbifold fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> for example , suppose an extended object of tension @xmath19 is sitting at the orbifold fixed point but is not confined to the fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> given that gravity itself is a derivative expansion of a more fundamental theory and that the curvature at the orbifold fixed point is singular , one would expect there to be large corrections to einstein s equation arising from higher derivative curvature terms . </S>",
    "<S> hence , one would find that the effective rs brane tension @xmath20 is a sum of an infinite number of higher curvature terms and @xmath19 : e.g. schematically , @xmath21 where the @xmath22 s correspond to curvature quantities , the @xmath23 correspond to coefficients of the derivative expansion , and @xmath24 is the five - dimensional planck scale . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , even if @xmath25 , one may in principle have a @xmath19 that is much larger , depending upon the precise nature of @xmath23 and @xmath22 . in that case , even without the `` confining '' effect of the orbifold fixed point , the brane would not `` fatten '' at a tev scale . on the other hand , the brane may fatten such that there may be associated collider signatures and an amelioration of the hierarchy problem .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that the rs brane can be treated as an idealized thin domain wall and neglect any possibility of brane fattening . as a partial follow - up to the work of ref.@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate both the gravitational and collider experimental prospects for this scenario . </S>",
    "<S> we find that although there is no collider phenomenology , the corrections to newton s law distinguish the @xmath12 scenario from the add scenario . </S>",
    "<S> we find that not only the functional behavior of the gravitational correction is different but the magnitudes are sufficiently different to distinguish the two scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , identifying the scale @xmath22 of the extra dimension in add with the ads horizon length @xmath2 of @xmath26 , we show that the @xmath12 gravitational correction is much larger at the reach of the upcoming experiments . owing to the larger number of moduli fields present in the the add scenario than in the @xmath12 scenario </S>",
    "<S> , other signatures may distinguish the two scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> however , these more model dependent questions will not be addressed in this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> we first calculate the newtonian potential generated by a point source of mass @xmath27 localized on the planck brane . </S>",
    "<S> explicitly , we consider the effects of the kk tower on the effective four - dimensional gravitational potential following the procedure of garriga and tanaka @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the details of this calculation can be found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and several of the relevant results ( including a derivation of the effective action to fix our notation and conventions ) are listed in the appendix . to determine for completeness the correction associated with an infrared cutoff in the ads space </S>",
    "<S> , we assume the dimension transverse to the planck brane is an @xmath28 orbifold , and place a cutoff brane at the other orbifold fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> we then examine the limiting behavior as the distance @xmath29 between the orbifold fixed points is taken to infinity . in practice , it would of course be extremely difficult to stabilize a cutoff brane at macroscopic distances . the potential can be written explicitly as a sum over terms involving bessel functions : @xmath30^{-1}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> however , for qualitative understanding it is important to note that the light kk modes ( with @xmath32 ) couple to the matter on the brane with a strength @xmath33 relative to the zero mode , while the heavy kk modes ( with @xmath34 ) couple with the same strength as the zero mode . </S>",
    "<S> the light states thus are responsible for the @xmath35 multiplicative correction to the newtonian potential , while the heavy states provide a multiplicative correction of the form @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> hence there is a transition between the two regions , as first noted by ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . to obtain a simple analytic expression for the potential </S>",
    "<S> , the two contributions must be patched together in the summation of the kk modes . </S>",
    "<S> we first interpolate between the two regions using a step - function approximation at the cutoff @xmath37 ; we refer the reader to the appendix for the details . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : bestapprox ] ) are sensitive to our step function treatment of the gravitational coupling between the states with @xmath42 and @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> note in particular that since @xmath44 is sensitive to the value of @xmath41 , we expect the exact form of this exponential to be an artifact of the abrupt change in the coupling @xmath45 of the kk states between @xmath42 and @xmath43 to the matter on the brane . </S>",
    "<S> an argument for there being no exponential suppression is presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> note that even in the @xmath46 limit , the @xmath47 term survives . </S>",
    "<S> presumably , in the original calculation of rs , this term was neglected due to the fact that @xmath48 was near the planck scale . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , the behavior for the newtonian potential makes a smooth transition between two and one extra flat dimensional behavior . </S>",
    "<S> as we shall see , this is consistent with the consideration in the momentum space applicable for colliders .    </S>",
    "<S> one can obtain a perhaps more accurate approximate expression for the potential using the approximation @xmath53 this formula can be obtained by approximating @xmath54 and @xmath55 as the leading sinusoidal function . after taking the @xmath56 limit , this results in @xmath57,\\ ] ] which is particularly useful for evaluating the newtonian potential corrections numerically . </S>",

    "<S> systematic corrections to the newtonian potential have been worked out explicitly in @xcite ; we use the results of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and list the relevant expressions in table [ tab1 ] under the heading `` add .

    "<S> [ mainresult ] we see the comparison between the @xmath12 and the add scenarios for @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the two - extra - dimension scenario which is well motivated from the point of view of the hierarchy problem , we will also consider the one extra dimension add scenario with the compactification scale @xmath22 set to @xmath2 , corresponding to a five dimensional planck scale of @xmath68 gev . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we plot @xmath61 for the add model with two extra dimensions ( @xmath69 ) and with one extra dimension ( @xmath70 ) . </S>",

    "<S> it shows that for @xmath73 and @xmath74 mm , multiplicative corrections of @xmath75 arise from the @xmath12 scenario which may be measured in the upcoming set of experiments ( for a recent review , see ref .  </S>",

    "<S> let us now consider the collider signatures of the @xmath76 model . </S>",

    "<S> we take the uv cutoff to be at the 5-d planck scale @xmath83 , at which we expect a more fundamental theory to take over . since we are making order of magnitude estimates , we can approximate the summation as an integral , and divide the kk states into the light ( @xmath84 ) and heavy ( @xmath85 ) groups as done in the calculation of the newtonian potential . </S>",
