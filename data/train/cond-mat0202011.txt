    "the kondo effect , a phenomenon discovered in the late 30s in diluted magnetic alloys , plays a crucial role in the low temperature properties of many strongly correlated systems , such as ce , y and u compounds.@xcite very recently kondo - like phenomena were also observed in the low - temperature transport properties of quantum dot devices , @xcite opening new opportunities to control the kondo effect experimentally , and starting a new field of research.@xcite    a quantum dot device consists of a small sized quantum dot ( qd ) weakly connected by tunnel barriers to two electrodes , called source and drain . in this system",
    "the qd may be considered as an artificial atom , in which a well defined number of electrons , @xmath1 , is confined .",
    "the energy required to add a new electron to the qd is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the capacitance of the qd itself .",
    "the energy @xmath0 is determined by the coulomb repulsion between two electrons in the qd and thus it scales with the inverse of the dot dimensions .",
    "therefore , in small sized qd , @xmath4 is usually larger than the coupling to the leads .",
    "an important aspect of a qd device is that the energy of electrons in the dot can be tuned by a gate voltage .",
    "increasing the gate voltage , the energy necessary to add a new electron decreases , eventually making the addition possible .",
    "thus it was shown that , at low temperature , the transport of electrons through the qd is allowed only at those values of the gate voltage at which the state with @xmath1 electrons is realized and that with @xmath5 electrons becomes suddenly energetically accessible ( coulomb blockade).@xcite    the idea that kondo - like phenomena should appear in such a system at very low temperature can be traced back to 1988 . in that year",
    "it was recognized that the anderson model , introduced in 1961 to describe a magnetic impurity in a metal,@xcite could also be applied to a qd coupled to its leads.@xcite soon afterwards several theoretical studies have been devoted to analyze the properties of such a system ( see e.g. refs . ) .",
    "it was predicted that at very low temperature ( @xmath6 , where t@xmath7 is the kondo temperature ) a narrow peak should appear in the local density of states , close to the fermi level .",
    "thus , states belonging to opposite electrodes should mix easier than at high temperature ( @xmath8 ) , and the conductance should increase . in addition , the kondo anomalies were predicted to appear only for odd @xmath1 , @xcite and thus only if the total spin of the electrons in the qd , @xmath9 , is half integer .",
    "these predictions are now confirmed by several experimental results.@xcite the kondo temperature of qd devices is however very small ( usually less than a few hundred mk ) compared to the one of diluted magnetic alloys ( usually a few k ) .",
    "recently , @xcite in some qd devices kondo anomalies have been observed for even @xmath1 as well ; it is believed that these deviations from the even / odd @xmath1 effect are related to the formation of integer spin states with @xmath10 .    in the present paper",
    "we will focus our attention on those qd devices for which the kondo effect occurs _ only _ for odd @xmath1 .",
    "the transport properties of such a qd device have been calculated by using many different approaches , such as the equations of motion method,@xcite the non - crossing approximation ( nca)@xcite and the exact numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) technique.@xcite within the nrg it was possible to calculate the conductance as a function of the gate voltage , and thus to obtain  in the case @xmath11  the even / odd effect in very good agreement with experimental results .",
    "similar results were also obtained with the approximate equations of motion method and with the nca .",
    "the latter method@xcite was applied to low temperature transport of a qd in the infinite @xmath0 limit and thus the even / odd alternation effect was obtained@xcite for @xmath1 switching from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "even if approximated , the nca can be easily extended to models in which the realistic levels structure of the qd is kept into account ( i.e. in the presence of several levels and possibly of an external magnetic field ) , thus becoming a very convenient method for a direct comparison to transport properties of real qd devices . as a matter of fact , the nca was used with success to study , e.g. , orbital degeneracy effects in diluted magnetic alloys.@xcite however , in the case of qd devices , it is first necessary to go beyond the @xmath14 condition , which does not account for the even / odd effect for all values of @xmath1 .    in the present work",
    "we apply the finite-@xmath0 nca method@xcite to the qd device system , modeled by the spin-1/2 anderson model .",
    "we calculate the conductance as a function of the position of the qd level , and study the system in the empty orbital , mixed valence and kondo regimes .",
    "our results are in good agreement with the exact numerical renormalization group ones .",
    "in particular , we obtain the correct behavior of the conductance both in the high temperature regime , @xmath8 , in which the conductance shows the coulomb blockade peaks , and the low temperature regime , @xmath15 , where the conductance increases for odd @xmath1 due to the kondo effect .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the model hamiltonian and give a short introduction to the finite-@xmath0 nca . in section iii",
    "we show and discuss the numerical results , in particular the linear - response conductance , which we compare to exact results and to experimental data . in section",
    "iv we study the scaling behavior of the conductance as a function of temperature , and we suggest an empirical formula which is valid both in the fermi - liquid and in the @xmath16 temperature regime , where the conductance has a logarithmic behavior .",
    "in order to describe a quantum dot ( qd ) coupled with its leads we adopt the anderson hamiltonian@xcite    @xmath17    here @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) creates ( destroys ) a conduction electron with momentum * k * and spin @xmath20 in one of the two leads , which we label with s ( source ) and d ( drain ) ; @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) creates ( destroys ) an electron with spin @xmath20 on the quantum dot ; @xmath23 is the energy of a single electron localized on the qd and @xmath0 is the coulomb interaction among electrons in the dot ; @xmath24 is the number of electrons operator for a given spin in the qd ;    @xmath25 is the hybridization between the leads and the qd states , whose modulus is supposed to be * k*-independent , with @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "the lead - dot coupling strengths are given by    @xmath28    it was shown@xcite  through a unitary transformation of the band states  that the hamiltonian ( [ h : anderson ] ) is equivalent to a two band anderson model in which the first band does not interact with the qd , and the second is coupled to the quantum dot states through the hybridization @xmath29 .",
    "thus the problem of calculating the transport properties of hamiltonian ( [ h : anderson ] ) is reduced to the problem of calculating the spectral properties of the one band anderson model , provided that the actual lead - dot coupling strength is given by@xcite    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the density of states ( per spin ) of the leads at the fermi level , @xmath32 .",
    "it is reasonable to approximate the conduction bands of the leads with those of a non interacting two dimensional fermi gas .",
    "thus the density of states ( dos ) per spin may be written as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is one half of the band - width , therefore @xmath35 .    the main difference between the anderson model used in the ordinary kondo problem and the one used here is the following . in the present model",
    "the energy difference @xmath36 is not fixed , but , on the contrary , it can be tuned by a gate voltage @xmath37 , coupled to the qd through a capacitor . from now on we set the fermi level @xmath38 . in first approximation , we can assume that @xmath39 increases linearly with @xmath40 ( with common conventions for the sign of gate voltage ) . thus the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of the system described by the hamiltonian ( [ h : anderson ] ) are functions of two external parameters : the temperature @xmath41 and the gate voltage @xmath37 .      in the linear response regime ( @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the source - drain voltage ) , the conductance of the system qd+leads , g , may be written in a landauer - like form@xcite    @xmath44    where for simplicity we assume that the couplings to the leads are symmetric ( @xmath45 ) . here @xmath46 is the fermi distribution function and @xmath47 is the retarded local green function , i.e. the fourier transform of @xmath48 .",
    "the quantity i m @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ landauer ] ) is proportional to the local density of states , @xmath50 , defined as    @xmath51    we point out that the effects of the coulomb interaction among electrons in the qd are contained in the local density of states .",
    "the main purpose of this work is thus to calculate @xmath50 as a function of temperature and gate voltage , and the resulting linear conductance .",
    "the low temperature transport properties of a mesoscopic system such as the qd+leads previously described are characterized by the phenomenon of charge quantization .",
    "when coulomb blockade occurs the number of electrons in the qd is a fixed integer .",
    "this number can be changed by raising the voltage of the gate electrode . in this way",
    "the energy of the electrons in the qd is lowered with respect to the fermi energy in the leads . the change in energy necessary to add a new electron is @xmath52 .",
    "this may be seen as the energy required to charge the qd , @xmath53 , where @xmath3 is the capacitance of the qd .",
    "thus the average number of electrons on the qd , @xmath54 , with    @xmath55    is an important quantity in this problem ( here @xmath56 is the degeneracy of @xmath23 and in the present case @xmath57 ) .",
    "the number of electrons is  like the conductance  a function of the local density of states .      in order to calculate @xmath50 , the local dos for the single impurity anderson model",
    ", we adopt the finite-@xmath0 non - crossing approximation ( unca ) approach,@xcite an extension of the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) to the finite @xmath0 anderson model .",
    "we point out that a finite @xmath0 treatment is necessary in order to calculate the correct behavior of the conductance as a function of the gate voltage ( and thus of the number of electrons on the qd ) .",
    "the nca is a diagrammatic technique introduced for the anderson model in the @xmath58 limit.@xcite the main idea of the nca is that the self energy can be expanded in a series of diagrams of order @xmath59 , where @xmath56 is the degeneracy of the local level , usually large for kondo impurities in diluted magnetic alloys ( e.g. @xmath60 for ce impurities ) .",
    "the non - crossing diagrams are summed up to all orders , and the first neglected diagrams are of order @xmath61 .",
    "the nca was proved to be successful@xcite already for @xmath57 .",
    "thus it was applied with good results also to the spin-1/2 @xmath62 anderson model out of equilibrium,@xcite e.g. it was used to calculate the behavior of the conductance as a function of the chemical potential in the qd+leads problem .",
    "the nca and the unca lead to a set of integral equations for the self energy , which have to be solved self - consistently .",
    "the number of equations depends on the number of many body states for the electrons in the qd . if @xmath0 is finite there are four possible manybody states , namely @xmath63 ( with energy @xmath64 ) , @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( degenerate , with energy @xmath67 ) , and @xmath68 ( with energy @xmath69 ) . for each state",
    "a self energy and a ionic propagator are introduced .",
    "thus we have three self energies , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and three propagators , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 ( due to spin degeneracy @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) .",
    "the unca equations may then be written as@xcite    @xmath78g_0(\\omega-\\varepsilon+{\\rm i}\\eta)+\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{\\gamma}{\\pi}\\int_{-d}^{d}{\\rm d}\\varepsilon \\ ;",
