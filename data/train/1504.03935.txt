    "they are the principal source of heavy elements and uv radiation . through the combination of winds , massive outflows ,",
    "expanding hii  regions and supernova explosions , they provide an important source of mixing turbulence in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "hii  regions are particularly interesting because they can trigger the formation of a new generation of stars .",
    "processes such ` collect and collapse ' ( e.g. @xcite ) and radiative driven implosion ( rdi ) ( e.g. @xcite ) have been convincingly demonstrated that occur around hii  regions leading to formation of stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these processes generate dense layers of gas and dust at the interface between the hii  regions and their parent molecular cloud , elongated columns ( pillars ) of gas pointing towards the ionizing sources , and cometary globules of dense gas @xcite . understanding the interplay between the ionizing radiation and",
    "the dense surrounding gas is very important to explain the origin of these peculiar structures , and hence to characterize triggered star formation .",
    "g46.5 - 0.2 ( hereafter g46 ) is a poorly studied hii  region about 8 in size located at ra @xmath6 191726 , dec @xmath6 115554  ( j2000 ) , on the border of the molecular cloud catalogued as grsmc g046.34 - 00.21 @xcite .",

    "@xcite detected hi absorption features up to 56.6  and based on kinematical considerations proposed for this hii  region the near distance of 3.8  kpc , while @xcite , using the same techniques , favored the far distance of 7.8  kpc .",
    "finally , @xcite resolved the kinematic distance ambiguity for g46 based on existing hi and @xmath0co sky surveys , confirming a near distance of 4  kpc , which will be adopted in what follows .",
    "figure [ present ] shows a two - color composite image of g46 field where the _ spitzer_-irac 8 @xmath5 m emission distribution is displayed in cyan and the _ spitzer_-mipsgal at 24 @xmath5 m in red .",
    "the emission displayed in cyan mainly corresponds to radiation originated in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules .",
    "the far - uv photons leaking from the hii  region excite the pahs , which then emit in the mid - infrared .",
    "this emission encircles the 24  @xmath5 m emission ( in red ) that arises from very small size dust grains which are heated but not destroyed by the uv photons .",
    "the emission at 8  @xmath5 m has a horse - shoe morphology , being thicker and more intense towards the east - northeast direction and open to the southwest , where it dilutes into the surrounding medium . precisely in the southwest direction ,",

    "in what follows we separately analyze the physical properties of the hii  region g46 ( sec . 3.1 ) , of the ambient molecular gas ( sect .",

    ", a distance of 4  kpc , and a total flux density of 2.7  jy as measured from the magpis image at 1.4  ghz , the total amount of ionizing photons needed to keep this source ionized turns out to be about n@xmath32 . assuming errors of about 10% in both the distance and the radio continuum flux density , we conclude that the exciting star should be an o7v @xcite .    in a rough attempt to identify the star(s ) candidate(s ) responsible for the ionized gas in the region we performed an optical and infrared photometric study of the point sources in the area ( see fig.[excitingstar ] ) based on the astrometric ucac3 catalog @xcite . only sources with detection in the optical b and r bands , and in the three near - infrared ( nir )",
    "_ j , h , k _ bands extracted from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , were considered .",
    "we found eight sources inside a circle of size 4   centered at the central coordinate of the hii  region .",
    "their locations are shown in fig.[excitingstar ] . from the optical and infrared magnitudes we constructed their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "we fit the available magnitudes ( optical b and r bands , the three _ jhk _ 2mass bands , and the four _ spitzer_-irac bands ) using the kurucz photospheric models @xcite included in the tool developed by @xcite to obtain the effective temperature , t@xmath33 , of each source .",
    "the fitting tool requires the assumption of the visual extinction , a@xmath34 , and the distance .",
    "we adopt a distance between 3.5 and 4.5  kpc . regarding the a@xmath34 , we derived it for each source from their _ ( j@xmath35h ) _ and _ ( h@xmath35k ) _ colors .",
    "we assumed the interstellar reddening law of @xcite ( a@xmath36 /a@xmath37 = 0.282 , a@xmath38 /a@xmath37",
    "= 0.175 , and a@xmath39 /a@xmath37 = 0.112 ) and the intrinsic colors _",
    "( j@xmath35h)@xmath40 _ and _ ( h@xmath35k)@xmath40 _ obtained by @xcite .    among the eight stars found in the region ,",
    "only three are compatible with a massive star located at the distance of g46 .",
    "the effective temperatures of the massive candidates stars obtained from the fitting are shown in table [ tablestar ] .",
    "stars # 6 and # 8 have a t@xmath33 of about 30000  k and 35000  k , respectively , which agree with the temperatures of o9.5v and o7v stars , respectively @xcite .",
    "the models predict an effective temperature of @xmath41 26000  k for source # 3 , suggesting that this star would be of a spectral type later than b0 .",
    "the fitted seds for sources # 6 and # 8 are shown in fig.[sed - kurucz ] . for the remaining sources # 1 , # 2 , # 4 , # 5 and # 7",
    ", the kurucz s models fail to fit with confidence their optical and nir magnitudes as a massive star at about 4  kpc .",
    "these sources are probably less massive foreground stars not related with g46 .",
    "thus , stars # 6 and # 8 are the most probable candidates to be the exciting stars of the hii   region .",
    "finally , the location of the star # 8 with respect to the radio continuum emission ( red in fig.[excitingstar ] ) , which looks like an incomplete ring , seems to better explain the curved morphology observed in the ionized gas distribution .",
    "the hii   region g46 is located in projection onto a border of the molecular cloud grsmc g046.34 - 00.21 catalogued by @xcite with an associated v@xmath42 of @xmath43 .",
    "@xcite established a kinematical distance of about 4 kpc for this molecular cloud , the same as for the hii   region g46 , supporting that both objects are linked .",
    "figure[13cogrs ] ( left ) displays the j=10 integrated emission distribution in the 40  62  velocity range .",
    "it can be seen that the hii  region seems to be evolving on the northeastern edge of the cloud .",
    "the molecular gas appears located in projection onto the diffuse emission at 8 @xmath5 m observed towards the southwest of the open border of g46 .",
    "it is noteworthy that there is no evidence of related molecular emission towards the east - northeast edge of the hii  region , where its associated pahs emission is thicker and more intense .",
    "the numerous studies of hii  regions and their surroundings usually show that the associated pahs emission is more intense towards the borders of the hii  regions with presence of molecular material .",
    "in other words , it is expected that an ionized bubble opens in the direction away from the cloud edge because the ionized gas would be less confined and could stream - out into the lower density ism , forming what is known as a `` blister - type '' hii   region @xcite . in the g46 case , however , the ring opens to the southwest , facing the elongated molecular cloud where apparently the density is higher .",
    "a possible explanation can be found from the morphology of the g46 radio continuum emission , which suggests a stalling effect of the ionized gas against the photodissociation region ( pdr ) towards the northeast ( see fig.[excitingstar ] ) .",
    "this fact suggests that although there is no j=10 detected towards this region , the density of the photodissociated gas is enough to confine the ionized gas .",
    "the atypical thickness of the pdr towards this edge could be due to the presence of relatively low density gas which is expected towards the edge of a molecular cloud whereby the far - uv photons would have greater penetration in the material . by the other hand",
    ", the non detection of radio continuum emission towards the open border of g46 suggests that the ionized gas escapes from g46 and dilutes in the ism .",
    "the presence of diffuse emission at 8 @xmath5 m towards the southwest of g46 supports this scenario .      as above mentioned , about 10  towards the southwest of the hii  region ( @xmath4112 pc at the assumed distance of 4 kpc ) it can be seen some pillar - like features emitting at 8 @xmath5 m , which are pointing to the ionizing source of g46 and seem to be embedded in the molecular cloud grsmc g046.34 - 00.21 .",
    "even though it seems to be a large distance , several pillars were found as far from the ionizing source as those analyzed in this work ( e.g in the vulpecula rift ; @xcite ) .",
    "what it is really remarkable in this case is that these pillars - like features , resembling heaps and corrugations , are well outside of the hii  region , in contrary as is usually found : bubble - like structures with pillars inside or over their boundaries . taking into account that the pillars point to the g46 open border , it is suggested that they were produced by uv photons escaped from the hii  region .    by inspecting the j=10 towards the pillar - like features ( fig.[13cogrs]-right )",
    ", we find that there are two molecular structures associated with them .",
    "the easternmost ir pillar - like feature has associated molecular gas between 54.0 and 56.5  ( white contours in fig.[13cogrs]-right ) , while the western one is related to a molecular structure ranging between 56.5 and 59.0  ( yellow contours in fig.[13cogrs]-right ) .",
    "the different velocity ranges for these molecular structures may either indicate that both features are located at slightly different positions along the line of sight or that they have a somewhat different kinematics .",
    "it is remarkable the good agreement between the morphology of the molecular gas and the pillar - like features as seen in ir .",
    "moreover , the molecular structures present a morphology consisting of a dense head with a less dense tail as is usually found and predicted by models and observations towards this kind of structures in the surroundings of hii   regions @xcite .",
    "however , following the work of @xcite , the appearance of these structures resembles a previous evolutive stage in the formation of pillars because it can not be appreciated a well - formed tail behind their heads . in what",
    "follow we characterize the interaction between the ionization radiation escaping from g46 and the pillar - like features .    in order to study the radiation influence over the tips of the pillar - like features and the possibilities of triggered star formation via radiative driven implosion ( rdi , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) we evaluate the pressure balance between the ionized gas stalling at the head of the pillars and the neutral gas of their interiors .",
    "assuming that the ionizing photons came from an o7v - type star located at the center of g46 ( see sect.[star ] ) , we use the predicted ionizing photon flux for an o7v star from @xcite and the projected distance between the star and the pillars to roughly estimate the amount of uv photons arriving at the surface of the pillars in @xmath44 @xmath45  s@xmath46 .",
    "this value represents an upper limit due to the fact that the projected distance between the star and the pillars is a lower limit to the actual distance between them .",
    "our predicted ionizing photon flux is similar to those measured towards several bright - rimmed clouds @xcite , which like the pillars , are molecular clouds sculpted by the radiation leaking from hii  regions , and in many cases they have the same large scale morphology as the pillars @xcite .    using the above obtained @xmath47 and following @xcite we estimate an upper limit for the electron density of about 64 @xmath48  for the expected ionized boundary layer ( ibl ) at the tip of both pillar - like structures .",
    "this is almost 3 times greater than the critical value of @xmath49 @xmath48 above which an ibl is able to develop around a cloud @xcite . to obtain this value",
    "we consider that the pillar heads have a radius of 0.5  and assume an effective thickness of the ionized boundary layer of @xmath50 .",
    "then , using a typical sound speed of the ionized gas of 11.4 , we obtain that the pillars tips are supporting an external pressure of p@xmath51 @xmath48 k. it is important to note that the obtained p@xmath52  represents strictly an upper limit because the predicted @xmath53 is an upper limit and due to the used @xmath54 ( see @xcite ) .    on the other side , integrating the j=10 emission over the area that contain each pillar head and using the typical lte formulae to derive the and h@xmath55 column densities by assuming a t@xmath56 k and [ h@xmath55/ ] @xmath57 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , we estimate the mass of each pillar head in about 450 and 300  for the eastern and western one , respectively .",
    "the area of each pillar head was assumed by taking into account the radius of their tips curvature , this is a circular area with radius of 0.5  for both pillar heads .",
    "thus , assuming spherical shapes , we estimate the molecular densities in about @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "then , considering the velocity interval in which each pillar structure extends , we obtain the velocity dispersion @xmath60 , which is in agreement with those predicted by models of pillars formation @xcite . finally , using the obtained densities and @xmath61 we derive the internal pressure for each pillar head in p@xmath62 , and @xmath63 @xmath48 k for the eastern and western one , respectively . as @xcite state ,",
    "these pressure values are very likely underestimated because the j=10 line underestimates the true density and this molecule may be depleted by selective photodissociation at the boundary of the clouds .",
    "following these authors , the internal pressure is likely underestimated by no more than a factor of 15 , thus we conclude that p@xmath64 should be between @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xmath48 k.    in conclusion , we obtain p@xmath67 @xmath68 p@xmath52 , which suggests that the diluted ionization front stalls at the pillar heads , probably until the effects of mass evaporation and increasing recombination within the ibl raises the ionized gas pressure to equilibrium with the interior pressure @xcite .",
    "this result shows that it is unlikely that a shock is propagating farther into the molecular gas , discarding that the rdi mechanism is on going in the pillars interior .      with the purpose of investigating the molecular material towards the open border of g46 we used higher - angular resolution data of several molecular species extracted from the jcmt database acquired towards this region ( see the rectangle in fig.[13cogrs]-left ) .",
    "figure [ cojc ] shows the integrated emission of the , , and c@xmath2o j=32 , while fig.[hcnco+ ] displays the  and hcn j=43 integrated emission .",
    "the and j=32 emission show clumpy , elongated molecular features , with a high density filament extending towards the southwest of the mapped region . towards the open border of g46 do not appear any considerable molecular emission , suggesting the presence of a pre - existing region with scarce molecular gas or that the uv - photons have carved the molecular cloud .",
    "in any case this can be the path followed by the uv - photons escaped from g46 to reach the farther pillar - like structures .",
    "the c@xmath2o j=32 ,  and hcn j=43 emissions are concentrated in a small compact clump related to the infrared dark cloud irdc 046.424 - 0.237 @xcite and to the millimeter continuum source bgps g046.427 - 00.237 ( see the bolocam galactic plane survey v2 ; @xcite ) , suggesting that the emission lines emanate from a deeply embedded clump .",
    "moreover , this structure is associated with the cold high - mass clump g46.43 - 0.24 @xcite in which the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) ammonia lines were detected at v@xmath7 52.3 and 52.9 , respectively .",
    "the detection of these molecular species , mainly the hcn j=43 line that its critical density can be between some @xmath69 and @xmath70 @xmath48 @xcite , indicates the presence of very high density gas .",
    "taking into account that this clump is a potential site of star formation , in what follows we analyze it .",
    "the line parameters of the observed molecular transitions towards the center of the clump are given in table[lines ] as derived from gaussian fits from the spectra shown in fig.[spectra ] .",
    "the j=32 was fitted using three gaussians , while the parameters of the others lines were obtained from single - components gaussian fits which coincide in velocity with the main component .",
    "the different velocity components observed in the spectrum are present almost in the whole region .",
    "thus , we conclude that they correspond to different molecular components seen along the line of sight , reflecting the clumpiness in the region .    in order to have a rough estimate of the molecular clump mass",
    "we assume local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "we calculate the excitation temperature from @xmath71 } \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 ) is the @xmath1co peak temperature towards the clump center at @xmath73 , obtaining t@xmath74 18 k. we derive the and c@xmath2o optical depths @xmath75 and @xmath76 from ( e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath77 where @xmath0t@xmath78 and @xmath2t@xmath78 are the peak temperatures of the and c@xmath2o j=32 line at the center of the region , and @xmath79 is the assumed isotope abundance ratio [ /c@xmath2o ] @xcite , obtaining @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which indicate that the c@xmath2o j=32 line appears moderately optically thin .",
    "thus , we estimate its column density from : @xmath82 with @xmath83 to obtain the molecular hydrogen column density n(h@xmath55 ) we assume an abundance ratio of [ h@xmath55/c@xmath2o ] @xmath84 @xcite . finally the mass was derived from : @xmath85 } ,   \\label{eq5}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is the solid angle subtended by the beam size",
    ", @xmath87 is the hydrogen mass , @xmath5 , the mean molecular weight , is assumed to be 2.8 by taking into account a relative helium abundance of 25 % , and @xmath88 is the distance .",
    "summation was performed over all beam positions on the molecular structure observed in c@xmath2o displayed in contours in fig.[cojc ] .",
    "the obtained mass is about 375 .",
    "assuming an ellipsoidal volume with semi - axis of 45 , 20 , and 20  we derive a density of n @xmath89 @xmath48 . the density should be higher in the innermost region of the clump where the hcn j=43 line emanates , showing a density gradient . using the deconvolved radius of about 0.5 pc calculated from : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the area inside the clump , we appreciate that the above obtained mass value is slightly over the mass  size threshold for massive star formation in irdcs presented in @xcite , suggesting that massive ysos can be formed within this clump .    using the derived  and hcn j=43 parameters listed in table[lines ] we performed a non - lte study of these molecular species with the code radex , which uses the mean escape probability approximation for the radiative transfer equation @xcite . using the measured @xmath92v we ran the code to fit t@xmath93 and estimate the column densities . taking into account that @xcite measured from the ammonia lines a kinetic temperature of t@xmath94 k towards this clump",
    ", we fix this parameter in 20 k and assume densities between 10@xmath95 and 10@xmath96 @xmath48 to obtain the values presented in table[tradex ] . from the obtained column densities we observe abundance hcn/  ratios of about 4.4 , 3.8 , and 1.2 for n@xmath97 , 10@xmath98 , and 10@xmath96 @xmath48 , respectively . in all cases",
    "we obtain a n(hcn)/n ( ) ratio larger than unity as found towards several clumps in the irdc g48.66 - 0.22 @xcite and the active star - forming region w49a @xcite .",
    "as these authors point out , the steady - state chemical models for molecular species in gas - phase predict hcn @xmath68  only for t@xmath99 25 k , with a density of n@xmath100 @xmath48 , which is consistent with our results .",
    "finally , given that the scenario is very favorable to initiate the formation of new generations of stars , we analyze in this section the existence and properties of young stellar objects in all the investigated area .",
    "young stellar objects ( ysos ) always show an excess in the infrared emission .",
    "the level of excess in the infrared can be effectively used for discriminating ysos from field stars and distinguishing different evolutionary stages . at a considerably early evolutionary stage , protostars are mostly embedded in dust envelopes , they exhibit large excess of infrared emission and an infrared spectral index @xmath101 indicative of flat or ascending spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at wavelength longward of 2 @xmath5 m @xcite . for pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars which possess optically thick disks , the seds tend to descend and the infrared spectral indices are in the range @xmath102 .",
    "finally `` transition disk '' sources are more evolved ysos , where the inner part of the disks have been cleared by photoevaporation of the central stars or by planet forming processes . for such ysos",
    "it is expected to detect ir excess at wavelengths longer than 16 @xmath5 m @xcite .",
    "these properties of ysos make photometric observations in the near- to mid - infrared plausible to discriminate them from field stars . different color - based source identification and classification schemes have been developed and verified in the practice . in this section , we identify potential ysos following the scheme proposed by @xcite .",
    "the resulting ysos are classified into class i ( protostars , including class 0 , class i , and `` flat spectrum '' sources ) , class ii , and `` transition disk '' sources .",
    "there are several kinds of contaminants that could be misidentified as ysos in our original sample .",
    "extragalactic contaminations could stem from star - forming galaxies and broad - line active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , which show pah feature emission yielding very red 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath5 m colors @xcite . in our own galaxy ,",
    "unresolved knots of shock emission and resolved pah emission are often detected in the irac bands , yielding additional contaminations .",
    "following the techniques presented in @xcite we exclude contaminants , and then identify and categorize potential ysos as described as follows .    in the first phase ,",
    "only sources with valid detections in all four irac bands have been considered .",
    "any source fulfilling color criteria of @xmath103-[4.5]>0.7 $ ] and @xmath104-[5.8]>0.7 $ ] is regarded as a class i yso . in the remaining pool ,",
    "class ii sources have been picked out based on the constraints of _ i _ ) @xmath103-[4.5]-\\sigma_1>0.15 $ ] , _ ii _ ) @xmath103-[5.8]-\\sigma_2>0.35 $ ] , _ iii _ ) @xmath104-[8.0]-\\sigma_3>0.5 $ ] , and _ iv _ ) @xmath103-[5.8]+\\sigma_2\\le\\frac{0.14}{0.04}\\times(([4.5]-[8.0]-\\sigma_3)-0.5)+0.5 $ ] . here ,",

    "sources with colors of @xmath108-[24]>2.5 $ ] or @xmath104-[24]>2.5 $ ] are classified to be `` transition disks '' . with the potential contaminants and ysos identified",
    "above excluded , there still remain some sources with bright 24  emission . for sources lacking valid photometric data in one or more of the irac bands ,",
    "they are picked out as additional class i type ysos once fulfilling @xmath109>7 $ ] and @xmath110-[24]>4.5 $ ] mag , where @xmath110 $ ] is the longest wavelength irac detection that we have .",
    "the classification scheme of @xcite includes three phases , using 2mass data to identify more ysos in addition to the aforementioned methods .",
    "however , in our case as g46 is much farther than the sources in @xcite , 2mass photometry would be severely affected by foreground interstellar extinction and the use of these near - ir data to identify ysos would induce heavy contamination from foreground field stars .",
    "thus , we do not use the near - ir bands in our ysos search .",
    "the above identification procedures have resulted in 106 ysos . and they are classified into 22 class i , 60 class ii , and 24 `` transition disks '' objects . a summary of the results is given in table [ tb - count ] .",
    "we note that the color based classification scheme would lead to misidentification . a class ii yso viewed at high inclination would show features resembling that of a class i source .",
    "an edge - on class i yso can have similar infrared color of a class 0 source .",
    "thus , all class i , ii , and `` transition disk '' sources identified in this paper are yso candidates .",
    "the distribution of these yso candidates on distinct color - color spaces are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig - cc - irac ] and [ fig - cc - mips ] .",
    "it is important to note that we also use the point sources extracted from @xcite to identify yso candidates and reached identical results .",
    "figure [ fig : yso - dis](a ) shows the large scale spatial distribution of the 106 ysos identified in the region . among the 82 class i and",
    "class ii ysos more than 40 ( about 50 percent ) are located in projection onto the molecular cloud grsmc g046.34 - 00.21 ( see fig .",
    "[ 13cogrs ] ) which fills only the 20 percent of the whole survey field .",
    "such a concentration of ysos is suggestive of active star formation taking place in the cloud . by the other hand , from the 24 `` transition disk '' found in the whole field",
    ", no one is detected in association with the molecular gas , indicating the relatively young nature of the ysos embedded in this cloud .",
    "interestingly all ysos associated with the molecular cloud are placed in projection between the open border of g46 and the head of the pillars . moreover , there are not young sources in the farthest part of the cloud behind the heads of these pillars ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : yso - dis](b ) ) .    from figure",
    "[ fig : yso - dis](a ) it can be appreciated only two concentrations of young objects over the whole field , one centered at 191630 , @xmath111115100  ( j2000 ) , consisting of 15 class ii type sources and the other one centered at 191700 , @xmath111114700  ( j2000 ) mostly composed by class i type ysos ( 9 sources ) , which are located just ahead the pillars - like features .",
    "a closeup view of the pillar - like features region is shown in figure [ fig : yso - dis](b ) .",
    "there is a point source revealed at 24 @xmath5 m which is too faint at irac bands and not listed in the glimpse catalog .",
    "we have marked this 24 @xmath5 m point source using a red circle in figure [ fig : yso - dis](b ) .",
    "weak at short wavelengths , this point source would be younger than other ones and could be a class 0 candidate .",
    "the fact that the class ii concentration is located closer to the open border of g46 than the class i group strongly suggests an age gradient in the ysos distribution . by the other hand",
    ", the absence of young sources inside and behind the pillar - like structures could show that the hii  region influence has not reached the molecular material behind the pillars , which is in agreement with the result of section [ pillars ] .",
    "we suggest a scenario where the propagation of ionization radiation escaping from the hii  region has triggered the star formation observed in the molecular cloud through rdi mechanism and then has stalled at the surface of the pillars heads .",
    "we can not discard that a growing density of the ibl reaches equilibrium with that of the cloud and thus , the shock front will continue their propagation into the cloud @xcite .",
    "additionally , in the region surveyed with the jcmt ( see yellow rectangle in fig.[13cogrs ] ) there are 5 yso candidates .",
    "one of them , a class i source , lies exactly at the center of the dense molecular clump mapped with the  and hcn j=43 ( see fig.[hcnco+ ] ) , which is in agreement with the molecular gas conditions studied in sec.[southclump ] .",
    "we have analyzed the hii  region g46.5 - 0.2 , its molecular environment and the young stellar objects placed in a wide region around it , searching for evidence of their physical connection and the possibility of induced star formation .",
    "we found a rich combination of mutual influences , underscoring the important role of hii  regions in favoring the formation of new stars not only on their immediate vicinity but also farther than a distance equivalent to its own radius .",
    "we characterized that the hii  region , located at about 4 kpc and with a radius of @xmath112 pc , is probably excited by an o7v star .",
    "its shape resembles a horse - shoe , with the bright , thick border towards the east - northeast and the open portion towards the southwest side . when mapping the distribution of the molecular gas associated with g46 we found that the hii  region is located close to the edge of the grsmc g046.34 - 00.21 molecular cloud and , curiously , g46 instead of opening in the direction of lower ambient density it does exactly in the opposite direction , towards the cloud .",
    "filamentary structure in the molecular cloud is observed , particularly in the @xmath1co j=32 and @xmath0co j=32 maps . towards the open border of g46",
    "do not appear any considerable molecular emission , suggesting the presence of a pre - existing region with scarce molecular gas or that the uv - photons have carved the molecular cloud .",
    "besides , close to the end of the observed filamentary structures in the cloud , the infrared images reveal the existence of pillar - like structures pointing towards the hii  region open border , which are associated with some narrow molecular filaments characterized using the @xmath0co j=10 line . from a pressure balance study we found that the internal pressure of the neutral gas in the pillar - like features heads are larger than the external pressure due to the ionized gas stalling at their tips , discarding that the rdi mechanism is on going .",
    "in addition , we analyzed a compact molecular clump located over the south border of g46 , obtaining a mass of @xmath41 375   and a density of about @xmath113 @xmath48 , with a higher density towards its center , where the hcn j=43 line is detected .",
    "taking into account that the expansion of the hii  region itself , and the injection of extra energy into the molecular cloud can drive turbulence and trigger star formation we searched for candidates of ysos and classified them according to their evolutionary stage .",
    "we identified two main concentrations of young objects over the whole region , one , closer to the g46 open border consisting of class ii type sources , and other one mostly composed by class i type ysos located just ahead the pillars - like features strongly suggesting an age gradient in the ysos distribution .",
