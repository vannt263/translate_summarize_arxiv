    "@xcite , this procedure yields series that apparently have finite radii of convergence and tend to values that are exponentially close to the exact ones .",
    "this also allows us to define the theory for negative or complex values of @xmath1 , a subject that has raised a lot of interest recently @xcite .",
    "an important feature of this approach is that for a perturbative expansion at a given order in @xmath1 , it is apparently possible to determine an optimal field cut using the strong coupling expansion @xcite , bridging the gap between the two expansions . in other words ,",
    "the modified perturbative methods allows us to take into account non - perturbative effects .    despite these promising features , calculating the modified coefficients remains a challenging technical problem . while developing a new perturbative method ( see e.g. ref .",

    "@xcite . in this letter",
    ", we show not only that this program can be completed in the case of the anharmonic oscillator , but also that the results show remarkable properties :    * for the two lowest orders , the approximate formulas obtained in the large field cutoff limit extend unexpectedly far in the low field cutoff region .",

    "we use @xmath9 . in the path integral formulation , introducing a field cutoff means that the paths with @xmath10 for some @xmath11 are excluded . in the operator language , it means that the wave function @xmath12 should vanish for @xmath13 .",

    "[ fig : num ] ) , then most of the coefficients have @xmath22 ( asymptotic regime ) and a linear behavior is observed for @xmath23 when @xmath20 increases .",

    "the function @xmath46 fits the collapsed data quite well on the upper right , but appears to be slightly above the data on the lower left .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the function satisfies the duality relation which exchanges the small and large field cutoff regions @xmath56 which can not be exact since the approach of 0 when @xmath57 is power like while in the large @xmath21 limit , the approach of 1 is exponentially small . in these two limits , @xmath46 fails to provide the correct behavior and we need to resort to the approximations discussed before .",
    "we expect similar features in higher dimensional scalar field theory with a uv regulator .",
    "generically , a modified perturbative calculation involves a few coefficients with values close to their usual ones , a few coefficients in the crossover region , and the rest of the coefficients taking values much smaller than in regular perturbation theory .",
    "these three regimes are reminiscent of the three regimes encountered when calculating renormalization group flows between two fixed points .",
    "one should notice the similarities between the graphs presented here and those of refs .",
    "@xcite where this type of crossover behavior is studied .",
    "in the same way , the approximate duality of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dual ] ) reminds of the duality between fixed points of a simplified renormalization group equation @xcite or the exchange between the perturbative and non - perturbative sectors of quasi - exactly solvable periodic potentials @xcite .",
    "we plan to make these analogies more specific ( or disprove these ideas ) , by making explicit calculations with dyson s hierarchical model .",
    "namely , we plan to compare the relative weighs of the three types of perturbative terms discussed above with the relative increases in the three regions of the renormalization group flows discussed above for the zero - momentum @xmath58-point functions .",
