    "the statistical description of the galaxy clustering is usually based on the two - point correlation function @xmath0 .",
    "this function is , following the terminology used by statisticians working in point field statistics , a second - order characteristic of the point process ( diggle 1993 ; stoyan & stoyan 1994 ) . the first - order characteristic is just the intensity measure @xmath1 ( martnez et al . 1993 ) . assuming the cosmological principle",
    ", we accept that galaxies in large volumes represent a stationary and isotropic point process , having therefore constant intensity equal to the number density of galaxies per unit volume , denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "among all the second - order characteristics of a point - process the most commonly used is the ripley s @xmath3-function ( ripley 1981 ) which is easily related to the mean number of galaxies lying in balls of radius @xmath4 centred in an arbitrary galaxy , @xmath5 ( peebles 1980 ) , or the correlation integral @xmath6 ( martnez et al 1995 ) . for a three - dimensional process",
    "we have that : @xmath7    it is obvious that for a homogeneous poisson process the @xmath3-function is @xmath8    it is well known the power - law behaviour of @xmath0 for the galaxy distribution , @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 mpc ( davis & peebles 1983 ) . in the strong clustering regime where @xmath12 , the previous behaviour is translated to a power - law behaviour in the ripley s function : @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "the exponent @xmath15 is known as the correlation dimension .",
    "we have argued that this value itself is an important measure of the clustering ( martnez et al .",
    "several authors have successfully fitted a power - law to the cluster - cluster correlation function . some of them claimed to have obtained a value of 1.8 for @xmath16 ( bahcall & soneira 1983 ) , but many others have not .",
    "recent calculations give no hope for a common value of the exponent @xmath16 for clusters and galaxies ( postman et al .",
    "for example dalton et al .",
    "( 1994 ) found that @xmath17 for the apm clusters .",
    "the correlation length found for clusters is larger than the one for galaxies , @xmath18 mpc .",
    "however a strong controversy has arosen about the value of @xmath19 ( bahcall & soneira 1983 ; bahcall et al .",
    "1986 , sutherland 1988 ; sutherland & efstathiou , 1991 ) . in this context",
    "one has to be cautious in interpreting the power - law behaviour of @xmath0 for clusters .",
    "moreover , in the range of scales where @xmath0 is of the order of unity it is obvious that @xmath20 and @xmath0 can not simultaneously display power - law behaviour .",
    "this could be the case for the distribution of clusters , which in the range [ 10 , 50 ] @xmath21 mpc present values less than 5 for @xmath0 .",
    "we have seen that probably @xmath20 fits better a power - law in this range than @xmath0 does and the exponent @xmath15 is different for galaxies and for clusters ( martnez et al .",
    "this variation of the relevant exponents with the the kind of object , galaxies of different morphological type or clusters with different richness , might be considered within the framework of the multiscaling hypothesis ( jensen et al .",
    "1991 , paladin et al .",
    "if all these astrophysical objects are interpreted as the consequence of applying different mass thresholds to a continuous density field , the multiscaling approach provides us with a theoretical way to understand the variations in the clustering properties which turn out in variations of the exponent @xmath15 .",
    "the higher the density threshold the stronger the clustering and therefore the smaller the value of the corresponding @xmath15 .",
    "we have tested this approach on several cluster and galaxy simulated samples and we conclude that the multiscaling approach is rather useful for the description of the large scale clustering in the universe .",
    "in fact the dependence of the clustering properties of clusters with different richness is a natural example to illustrate how multiscaling works ( paredes et al .",
    "we shall see here that the use of the function @xmath20 with appropriate unbiased estimators is the best tool for the study of the multiscaling distribution in models of clusters of galaxies and at the same time gives us information about the scale where the transition to homogeneity appears .",
    "the estimators of a statistical quantity as @xmath20 need to have several good properties ( stoyan & stoyan 1994 ) , but obviously the most important one is that the estimator must be unbiased , in the sense that the mean value of the estimates when applied to different samples of a given process has to be equal to the true value of the statistical quantity . at large distances ,",
    "the unbiasedness of @xmath20 is mostly related with the edge - corrections of the estimators . here",
    "we shall use the estimator proposed by ripley ( 1976 ) and baddeley et al .",
    "( 1993 ) . for @xmath22 galaxies at positions",
    "@xmath23 distributed in a volume @xmath24 , it reads : @xmath25 @xmath26 being the step function , which is 0 for negative values of its argument and 1 for positive ones .",
    "the weight @xmath27 is the proportion of the area of the sphere , centred at @xmath28 and passing through @xmath29 , which lies inside the volume @xmath24 . in the case of a cubic sample",
    "such as we consider , baddeley et al .",
    "( 1993 ) give a ( complicated ) analytic expression for it that we can use . the sum in eq .",
    "( 3 ) is an unbiased estimator for @xmath30 ( ripley 1976 , 1981 ; diggle 1983 ) . for more details",
    "see also martnez & pons ( 1996 ) .",
    "the fractal behaviour of the distribution of galaxy clusters has a breakdown at some given distance ( borgani et al .",
    "1994 ) , in which the tendency to homogeneity appears in an evident way . here",
    "we shall use a numerical model for the distribution of rich clusters . in this model ,",
    "clusters are identified as the peaks in the evolved density field of zeldovich simulations with @xmath31 , where 30% of this critical density is provided by massive neutrinos and the rest by cold particles ( klypin et al .",
    "1993 , borgani et al .",
    "1995 ) . applying different density thresholds to the simulation",
    "we obtain samples ressembling the samples of rich galaxy clusters .",
    "the higher the threshold the richer the corresponding clusters and the larger the mean separation between them . using the mean particle separation @xmath32 as the control parameter",
    "we have extracted 5 samples from one realization of the model . in figure 1 , we show these samples drawn from a simulation in a cube of side @xmath33 mpc .    in figure 2",
    "we show the @xmath3-function for each of the previous samples , together with the variation of the correlation dimension @xmath15 with the scale @xmath4 .",
    "this latter value has been calculated as the local slope of the log - log plot @xmath20 vs. @xmath4 in a range of scales of 10 @xmath21 mpc width centred at each value of @xmath4 .",
    "we can see that for scales in the range [ 10 , 40 ] @xmath21 mpc the function @xmath20 follows reasonably well a power law with exponent @xmath34 .",
    "however the exponent depends on the density in the way prescribed by the multiscaling hypothesis : for higher density threshold ( or equivalently larger interparticle distances ) , smaller values of @xmath15 are found , indicating stronger clustering . for scales larger than 40 @xmath21 mpc , a clear tendency to homogeneity ( represented by the dotted line in the lower panel ) is observed . in the plots of @xmath15 as a function of the scale , we can clearly see these two kinds of behaviour . first a noticeable plateau , in which the value of @xmath15 oscillates without any clear trend around a constant value for each sample .",
    "this happens for small scales . for larger scales the local value of @xmath15 increases with @xmath4 , indicating a clear tendency to homogeneity , which is formally reached around 100 @xmath21 mpc , where @xmath35 .",
