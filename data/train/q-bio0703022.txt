    "gene networks are extremely robust against genetic perturbations @xcite . for example , systematic gene knock - out studies on yeast showed that almost 40% of genes on chromosome v have no detectable effects on indicators like cell division rate @xcite .",
    "similar studies on other organisms agree with these results @xcite .",
    "it is also known that phenotypically , most species do not vary much , although they experience a wide range of environmental and genetic perturbations .",
    "this striking resilience makes one wonder about the origins , evolutionary consequences , and mechanistic causes of genetic robustness .",
    "it has been proposed that genetic robustness evolved through stabilizing selection for a phenotypic optimum .",
    "wagner showed that this in fact could be true by modeling a developmental process within an evolutionary scenario , in which the genetic interaction sequence represents organismal development , and the equilibrium configuration of the gene network represents the phenotype @xcite .",
    "his results show that the genetic robustness of a population of model genetic regulatory networks can increase through stabilizing selection for a particular equilibrium configuration ( phenotype ) of each network .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the effects of the biological evolution of genetic robustness on the dynamics of gene regulatory networks in general .",
    "in particular , we want to answer the question whether the evolution process moves the system to a different point in the phase diagram .",
    "below , we present some preliminary results .",
    "we use a model by wagner @xcite , which has also been used by other researchers with minor modifications . each individual",
    "is represented by a regulatory gene network consisting of @xmath0 genes .",
    "the expression level of each gene , @xmath1 has only two values , @xmath2 or @xmath3 , expressed or not , respectively .",
    "the expression states change in time according to regulatory interactions between the genes .",
    "the time evolution of the system configuration represents an ( organismal ) developmental pathway .",
    "the discrete - time dynamics are given by a set of nonlinear difference equations representing a random threshold network ( rtn ) , @xmath4 where sgn is the sign function and @xmath5 is the strength of the influence of gene @xmath6 on gene @xmath7 .",
    "nonzero elements of the @xmath8 matrix @xmath9 are independent random numbers drawn from a standard normal distribution .",
    "( the diagonal elements of * @xmath9 * are allowed to be nonzero , corresponding to self - regulation . )",
    "the ( mean ) number of nonzero elements in @xmath9 is controlled by the connectivity density , @xmath10 , which is the probability that a @xmath5 is nonzero .",
    "the dynamics given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : main ] ) can have a wide variety of features .",
    "for a specified initial configuration @xmath11 , the system reaches either a fixed - point attractor or a limit cycle after a transient period .",
    "the lengths of transients , number of attractors , distribution of attractor lengths , etc . can differ from system to system , depending on whether the dynamics are ordered , chaotic , or critical .",
    "the fitness of an individual is defined by whether it can reach a developmental equilibrium , a certain fixed gene - expression pattern , @xmath12 , in a `` reasonable '' transient time .",
    "further details of the model are explained in the next section .",
    "we studied populations of @xmath13 random networks ( founding individuals ) with @xmath14 .",
    "each network was assigned a matrix @xmath9 and an initial configuration @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath9 was generated as follows .",
    "each @xmath5 was independently chosen to be nonzero with probability @xmath10 .",
    "if so , it was assigned a random number drawn from a standard gaussian distribution , @xmath15 .",
    "then , each `` gene '' of the initial configuration , @xmath16 , was assigned either @xmath3 or @xmath2 at random , each with probability 1/2 .",
    "after @xmath9 and @xmath11 were created , the dynamics were started and the network s stability was evaluated . if the system reached a fixed point , @xmath17 in @xmath18 timesteps , then it was considered stable and kept .",
    "otherwise it was considered unstable , both @xmath9 and @xmath11 were discarded , and the process was started over and repeated until a stable network was generated . for each stable network , its fixed point , @xmath12 , was regarded as the `` optimal '' gene - expression state ( phenotype ) of the system .",
    "this is the only modification we made to wagner s model : he generated networks with preassigned @xmath11 and @xmath12 , whereas we accept any @xmath19 as long as it can be reached within @xmath18 timesteps from @xmath11 .",
    "after generating @xmath13 individual stable networks , we analyzed their state - space structures and evaluated their robustness as discussed in subsection [ sub : assesment - of - epigenetic ] .      in order to generate a breed of more robust networks , a mutation - selection process was simulated for all of the @xmath13 random , stable networks as follows",
    "first , a clan of @xmath20 identical copies of each network was generated .",
    "for each clan , a four - step process was performed for @xmath21 generations :    1 .",
    "recombination : each pair of the @xmath0 rows of consecutive matrices in the clan were swapped with probability 1/2 .",
    "since the networks were already shuffled in step 4 ( see below ) , there was no need to pick random pairs .",
    "2 .   mutation : each nonzero @xmath5 was replaced with probability @xmath22 by a new random number drawn from the same standard gaussian distribution .",
    "thus , on average , one matrix element was changed per matrix per monte carlo step .",
    "fitness evaluation : each network was run starting from the original initial condition , @xmath11 . if the network reached a fixed point , @xmath23 within @xmath18 timesteps , then its fitness , @xmath24 , was calculated .",
    "here @xmath25 , denotes the normalized hamming distance between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and @xmath28 denotes the strength of selection , @xmath19 is the optimal gene - expression state , which is the final gene - expression state of the original network that `` founded '' the clan .",
    "we used @xmath29 .",
    "if the network could not reach a fixed point , then it was assigned the minimum nonzero fitness value , @xmath30 4 .",
    "selection / asexual reproduction : the fitness of each network was normalized to the fitness value of the most fit network in the clan .",
    "then , a network was chosen at random and duplicated into the descendant clan with probability equal to its normalized fitness .",
    "this process was repeated until the size of the descendant clan reached @xmath31",
    ". then the old clan was discarded , and the descendant clan was kept as the next generation .",
    "note that this process allows multiple copies ( offspring ) of the same network to appear in the descendant clan , while some networks may not make it to the next generation due to genetic drift .    at the end of the @xmath21 generation selection ,",
    "any unstable networks were removed from the evolved clan .",
    "the mutational robustness of a network was assessed slightly differently for random and evolved networks . for a random network ,",
    "first , one nonzero @xmath5 was picked at random and replaced by a new random number with the same standard gaussian distribution .",
    "then , the dynamics were started , and it was checked if the system reached the same equilibrium state , @xmath19 , within @xmath18 timesteps .",
    "this process was repeated @xmath32 times using the original matrix ( i.e. , each mutated matrix was discarded after its stability was evaluated ) . the robustness of the original network before evolution was defined as the fraction of singly - mutated networks that reached @xmath19 .    for the evolved networks ,",
    "clan averages were used . for each of @xmath33 networks in a clan ,",
    "robustness was assessed as described above with one difference : the number of perturbations was reduced to @xmath34 per network to keep the total number of perturbations used to estimate robustness of networks before and after evolution approximately equal .",
    "the mean robustness of the those @xmath35 networks was taken as the robustness of the founder network after evolution .",
    "therefore , the robustness of a network after evolution is the mean robustness of its descendant clan of stable networks .",
    "as wagner pointed out , the stabilizing selection described above increases the robustness of the model population against mutations @xcite .",
    "however , it is not very clear what kind of a reorganization in the state space occurs during the evolution .",
    "also , it is not known whether this robustness against mutations leads to robustness against environmental perturbations . in this paper , we focus on the effects of evolution in terms of moving the system to another point in the phase diagram . in other words ,",
    "we investigate whether the system becomes more chaotic or more ordered after evolution .",
