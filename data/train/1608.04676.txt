    "this description can be extended to ` heavy graphene ' ( consisting of @xmath1c instead of a natural isotope mixture ) .",
    "a heavier atomic mass affects the velocity through two effects : the phonon band structure is scaled by the square root of the mass ratio ( from the mass prefactor of the dynamical matrix ) , and the squared velocity is scaled by the mass ratio itself ( equation  [ eq2 ] ) . at room temperature ,",
    "the first correction reduces the velocity by 3% in fully @xmath1c graphene compared to normal graphene , and the second one reduces it by an additional 10% , resulting in @xmath36  m@xmath34s@xmath35 .      in our experiments , we recorded time series at room temperature using the nion ultrastem100 microscope , where each atom , or its loss , was visible in every frame .",
    "we chose small fields of view ( @xmath371@xmath381 nm@xmath34 ) and short dwell times ( 8 @xmath39s ) to avoid missing the refilling of vacancies ( an example is shown in figure  [ stemko ] ; likely this vacancy only appears to be unreconstructed due to the scanning probe ) .",
    "in addition to commercial monolayer graphene samples ( quantifoil  r  2/4 , graphenea ) , we used samples of @xmath1c graphene synthesized by chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) on cu foils using @xmath1c - substituted ch@xmath40 as carbon precursor , subsequently transferred onto quantifoil tem grids . an additional sample consisted of grains of @xmath0c and @xmath1c graphene on the same grid , synthesized by switching the precursor during growth ( methods ) .",

    "a single carbon atom has been ejected in the fourth frame ( panel f , white circle ) , but the vacancy is filled already in the next frame ( panel  g ) . the top row of ( c  g ) contains the unprocessed images , the middle row has been treated by a gaussian blur with a radius of 2 px , and the colored bottom row has been filtered with a double gaussian procedure@xcite ( @xmath41 px , @xmath42  px , weight  @xmath43).[stemko],scaledwidth=59.0% ]    from each experimental dataset ( full stem data available@xcite ) within which a clear displacement was observed , we calculated the accumulated electron dose until the frame where the defect appeared ( or a fraction of the frame if it appeared in the first one ) .",
    "the distribution of doses corresponds to a poisson process@xcite whose expected value was found by log - likelihood minimization ( methods ; supplementary figure  2 ) , directly yielding the probability of creating a vacancy ( the dose data and statistical analyses are included in supplementary data 2 ) . figure  [ csplot ] displays the corresponding displacement cross sections measured at voltages between 80 and 100  kv for normal ( 1.109% @xmath1c ) and heavy ( @xmath4499%  @xmath1c ) graphene , alongside values measured earlier@xcite using high - resolution tem ( hrtem ) . for low - probability processes ,",
    "the cross section is highly sensitive to both the atomic velocities and the displacement threshold energy . since heavier atoms do not vibrate with as great a velocity , they receive less of a boost to the momentum transfer from an impinging electron",
    "thus , fewer ejections are observed for @xmath1c graphene .",
    "the theoretical total cross sections @xmath45 are plotted in figure  [ csplot ] for each voltage ( methods ; supplementary table 1 , supplementary data 2 ) .",
    "the motion of the nuclei was included via a gaussian distribution of atomic out - of - plane velocities @xmath46 characterized by the dft - calculated @xmath47 , similar to the approach of ref .  .",
    "a common displacement threshold energy was fitted to the dataset by minimizing the variance - weighted mean square error ( the 100  kv hrtem point was omitted from the fitting , since it was underestimated probably due to the undetected refilling of vacancies , also seen in figure  [ stemko ] ) .",
    "the optimal @xmath4 value was found to be 21.14  ev , resulting in a good description of all the measured cross sections .",
    "notably , this is 0.8  ev lower than the earlier value calculated by dft , and 2.29  ev lower than the earlier fit to hrtem data@xcite .",
    "different exchange correlation functionals we tested all overestimate the experimental value ( by less than 1  ev ) , with the estimate @xmath48 $ ] closest to experiment resulting from the c09 van der waals functional@xcite ( methods ) .",
    "c and @xmath1c measured at different acceleration voltages . *",
    "the stem data is marked with squares , and earlier hrtem data@xcite with circles .",
    "the error bars correspond to the 95% confidence intervals of the poisson means ( stem data ) or to previously reported estimates of statistical variation ( hrtem data@xcite ) .",
    "the solid curves are derived from our theoretical model with an error - weighted least - squares best - fit displacement threshold energy of 21.14 ev .",
    "the shaded areas correspond to the same model using the lowest dft threshold @xmath49 $ ] ev . the inset is a closer view of the low cross section region.[csplot],scaledwidth=100.0% ]    despite dft overestimating the displacement threshold energy , we see from the good fit to the normal and heavy graphene datasets that our theory accurately describes the contribution of vibrations .",
    "further , the hrtem data and the stem data are equally well described by the theory despite having several orders of magnitude different irradiation dose rates .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the very short lifetimes of electronic and phononic excitations in a metallic system@xcite compared to the average time between impacts .",
    "even a very high dose rate of @xmath50  e@xmath51@xmath35s@xmath52  corresponds to a single electron passing through a 1  nm@xmath34 area every @xmath53  s , whereas valence band holes are filled in@xcite @xmath54  s and core holes in@xcite @xmath55  s , while plasmons are damped within@xcite @xmath56  s and phonons in@xcite @xmath57  s. our results thus show that multiple excitations do not contribute to the knock - on damage in graphene , warranting another explanation ( such as chemical etching@xcite ) for the evidence linking a highly focused hrtem beam to defect creation@xcite .",
    "each impact is , effectively , an individual perturbation of the equilibrium state .",
    "finally , to test the spatial resolution of our method , we studied a sample consisting of joined grains of @xmath0c and @xmath1c graphene .",
    "isotope labeling combined with raman spectroscopy mapping is a powerful tool for studying chemical vapor deposition growth of graphene@xcite , which is of considerable technological interest .",
    "earlier studies have revealed the importance of carbon solubility into different catalyst substrates to control the growth process@xcite .",
    "however , the spatial resolution of raman spectroscopy is limited , making it impossible to obtain atomic - scale information of the transition region between grains of different isotopes .",
    "the local isotope analysis is based on fitting the mean of the locally measured electron doses with a linear combination of doses generated by poisson processes corresponding to @xmath0c and @xmath1c graphene using the theoretical cross section values at 100  kv .",
    "although each dose results from a stochastic process , the expected doses for @xmath0c and @xmath1c are sufficiently different that measuring several displacements decreases the error of their mean well below the expected separation ( figure  [ localdata]c ) . to estimate the expected statistical variation for a certain number of measured doses , we generated a large number of sets of @xmath58 poisson doses , and calculated their means and standard errors as a function of the number of doses in each set .",
    "the calculated relative errors scale as @xmath59 and correspond to the precision of our measurement , which is better than 20% for as few as five measured doses in the ideal case .",
    "although our accuracy is difficult to gauge precisely , by comparing the errors of the cross sections measured for isotopically pure samples to the fitted curve ( figure  [ csplot ] ) , an estimate of roughly 5% can be inferred .",
    "working at 100  kv , we selected spots containing areas of clean graphene ( 43 in total ) each only a few tens of nanometers in size ( figure  [ stemko]a ) , irradiating 415 ( mean 7.8 ) fields of view 1@xmath381  nm@xmath34 in size until the first displacement occurred ( figure  [ stemko]f ) . comparing the mean of the measured doses to the generated data",
    ", we can estimate the isotope concentration responsible for such a dose .",
    "this assignment was corroborated by raman mapping over the same area , allowing the two isotopes to be distinguished by their differing raman shift .",
    "a general trend from @xmath0c - rich to @xmath1c - rich regions is captured by both methods ( figure  [ localdata]b ) , but a significant local variation in the measured doses is detectable ( figure  [ localdata]c ) .",
    "this variation indicates that the interfaces formed in a sequential cvd growth process may be far from atomically sharp@xcite , instead spanning a region of hundreds of nanometers , within which the carbon isotopes from the two precursors are mixed together .",

    "c ) locally measured mean doses and their standard errors plotted on a log scale for each grid square .",
    "the horizontal colored areas show the means @xmath60 standard errors of doses simulated for the theoretical @xmath0c and @xmath1c cross sections .",
    "note that the greater variation in the experimental doses is expected for areas containing a mix of both carbon isotopes.[localdata],scaledwidth=92.0% ]",
    "it is interesting to compare our method to established mass analysis techniques . in isotope ratio mass spectrometry precisions of 0.01% and accuracies of 1%",
    "have been reported@xcite .",
    "however , these measurements are not spatially resolved . for spatially resolved techniques ,",
    "one of the most widely used is time - of - flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy ( tof - sims ) .",
    "it has a lateral resolution typically of several micrometers , which can be reduced to around 100 nm by finely focusing the ion beam@xcite . in the case of tof - sims ,",
    "separation of the @xmath1c signal from @xmath0c@xmath61h is problematic , resulting in a reported@xcite precision of 20% and an accuracy of @xmath4411% .",
    "the state - of - the - art performance in local mass analysis can be achieved with atom - probe tomography@xcite ( apt ) , which can record images with sub - nanometer spatial resolution in all three dimensions .",
    "a recent apt study of the @xmath1c/@xmath0c ratio in detonation nanodiamonds reported a precision of 5% , but biases in the detection of differently charged ions limited accuracy to @xmath4425% compared to the natural isotope abundances@xcite .",
    "a limitation of tof - sims is its inability to discriminate between the analyte and contaminants and that it requires uniform isotope concentrations over the beam area for accurate results .",
    "apt requires the preparation of specialized needle - like sample geometries , a laborious reconstruction process to analyse its results@xcite , and its detection efficiency is rather limited@xcite . in our case , we are only able to resolve relative mass differences between isotopes of the same element in the same chemical environment . while we do not need to resolve mass differences between different elements , since these differ in their scattering contrast , we do need to detect the ejection of single atoms , limiting the technique to atomically thin materials .",
    "however , our method captures the isotope information concurrently with atomic resolution imaging in a general - purpose electron microscope , without the need for additional detectors .",
    "we have shown how the ngstrm - sized electron probe of a scanning transmission electron microscope can be used to estimate isotope concentrations via the displacement of single atoms .",
    "although these results were achieved with graphene , our technique should work for any low - dimensional material , including hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn ) and transition metal dichalcogenides such as mos@xmath62 .",
    "this could potentially extend to van der waals heterostructures@xcite of a few layers or other thin crystalline materials , provided a difference in the displacement probability of an atomic species can be uniquely determined .",
    "neither is the technique limited to stem : a parallel illumination tem with atomic resolution would also work , although scanning has the advantage of not averaging the image contrast over the field of view .",
    "the areas we sampled were in total less than 340  nm@xmath34 in size , containing approximately 6600 carbon atoms of which 337 were ejected .",
    "thus while the nominal mass required for our complete analysis was already extremely small ( 131  zg ) , the displacement of only five atoms is required to distinguish a concentration difference of less than twenty percent .",
    "future developments in instrumentation may allow the mass - dependent energy transfer to be directly measured from high - angle scattering@xcite , further enhancing the capabilities of stem for isotope analysis .",
