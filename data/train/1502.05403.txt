    "the reverse shock ( rs ) in sn 1987a is the surface where the freely expanding debris is suddenly decelerated as it encounters circumstellar matter .",
    "hydrogen atoms crossing the shock are excited by collisions in the shocked plasma and emit h-@xmath0 and lyman-@xmath0 photons having doppler shifts corresponding to the projected velocity of the freely expanding debris immediately inside the shock .",
    "this emission was predicted by  @xcite and subsequently observed and interpreted by  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the freely expanding supernova debris obeys a `` hubble s law '' , i.e. , the doppler velocity is given by @xmath3 = @xmath14/@xmath15 , where @xmath14 is the projected distance along the line of sight measured relative to the center of the explosion and @xmath15 is the time since the supernova explosion ( @xmath13  27.5 years in mid-2014 ) .",
    "thus , surfaces of constant doppler shift are planar sections of the debris .",
    "the fluxes of h-@xmath0 and lyman-@xmath0 photons emitted at the rs are directly proportional to the fluence of hydrogen atoms across the shock .",
    "these facts create a unique opportunity to map the three - dimensional structure of the rs in sn  1987a and provide an empirical framework for studies of the shock interaction .",
    "this opportunity has been exploited in observations with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) . in the stis observations ,",
    "the h-@xmath0 emission from the rs was clearly visible near the circumstellar equatorial ring ( er ) , where the shock is strongest  @xcite .",

    "( 2003 ) modeled the rs surface , concluding that the observed emission was confined to within @xmath16  @xmath17  30  of the ring plane , similar to the opening angle of the ring observed at radio wavelengths  @xcite .",
    "however , the stis exposures were not deep enough to detect h-@xmath0 emission at high latitudes ( i.e. , out of the er plane ) , where the fluence of atoms is much smaller than near the equator .",
    "moreover , none of the spectroscopic observations included enough stis slit locations to map the entire shock surface .    in this letter",
    ", we describe the results of an observing campaign to map the high - velocity h-@xmath0 and lyman-@xmath0 emission using filters that transmit the blue- and red - shifted emission from the debris while suppressing the bright emission from the er . in sections 2 and 3 , the new @xmath18 observations are described ; for the first time we detect emission from the shock above and below the ring plane . in section 4 , we compare h-@xmath0 , lyman-@xmath0 , and x - ray observations , arguing that the majority of the lyman-@xmath0 flux is driven by x - ray heating of the outer ejecta , as proposed in our earlier work ( e.g. , larsson et al . 2011 ; france et al . 2011 ; fransson et al . 2013 ) .",
    "we obtained images of sn  1987a with the wfc3 camera in four filters to isolate the high - velocity h-@xmath0 : blue high - velocity h-@xmath0 ( `` h-@xmath0 blue '' , f645n ) , red high - velocity h-@xmath0 ( `` h-@xmath0 red '' , f665n ) , and two narrow - band filters centered on shocked emission from the er and hotspots ( narrow h-@xmath0 , f656n and [ ] @xmath19  6583   , f658n ) . the wfc3 images each have exposure times of 2880 seconds and were acquired on 21 june 2014 .",

    "the narrow band images are used to subtract these contributions to the high velocity material images ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the f656n image provided the best template for the north - dominated high - velocity `` h-@xmath0 blue '' image .",
    "the f658n filter contains a significant contribution from redshifted h-@xmath0 on the southern side of the remnant , therefore this filter provided the best template for the south - dominated high - velocity `` h-@xmath0 red '' image . in figure 2",
    "( right ) , the er appears black ; however this is an artifact of the intentional oversubtraction and stretch of the images for display . for the quantitative analysis in section 4 , a smaller er",
    "subtraction is applied ; the emission is nearly continuous across the north and south er region .",
    "we observed the lyman-@xmath0 emission from sn 1987a with the acs / sbc f122 m filter for three orbits ( 9200 seconds ; figures 3 and 4 ) .",
    "the f122 m filter bandpass is shown on an @xmath18-cos spectrum  @xcite in figure 3 . in this case ,",
    "resonant scattering by the neutral ism of the milky way and large magellanic cloud acts as a natural blocking filter for low - velocity emission from the er and no additional subtraction is necessary .",
    "a uv - bright b star ( `` star 3 '' ) appears to the southeast in all imaging bands , providing a common reference point .",
    "we complement the @xmath18 imaging with a recent ( 2014 march 19 , day 9885 ) 0.3    8.0 kev image from @xmath9  ( frank et al .  ",

    "emission from the a - b and a - r regions are produced by h atoms passing through the rs near the north and south side of the er , respectively .",
    "the bright h-@xmath0 emission features ( a - b and a - r ) from the rs have been partially mapped in 3 dimensions by stis observations ( e.g. , michael et al . 2003 ; heng et al .",
    "2006 ; france et al .",
    "2010 ) . in the `` h-@xmath0 blue '' image ( figure 2 , top ) a bright crescent - shaped feature covers the north side of the er ( as defined by the [ ] contours ) , labeled b - b .",
    "given the 43  inclination of the ring , the b - b region must originate from significantly above the ring plane for it to be visible in this configuration .",
    "this image also shows faint streaks that cross the ring extending towards the south ( c - b ) .",
    "the features labeled a - r , b - r , and c - r are analogous to the blue side , but reflected about the major axis of the er . the additional feature labeled d - r is probably emission from the internal debris , which is expanding with radial velocities ranging up to @xmath16  3500 km s@xmath4  @xcite .    combining the `` h-@xmath0 blue '' and `` h-@xmath0 red '' images",
    ", we measure the spatial extent of the high - velocity h-@xmath0 regions ( positional uncertainties @xmath20  0.05 ) .",
    "the high - velocity material interior to the ring ( a regions ) has north - south and east - west diameters of 0.94  @xmath6 1.31 , which when including the inclination translates to physical dimensions of ( 9.9  @xmath6  9.8 )  @xmath6  10@xmath21 cm ( assuming @xmath22  =  50 kpc ) .",
    "this suggests a symmetric , radial flow with a maximum radial velocity of 5.7  @xmath6  10@xmath23 km s@xmath4 ( at 27.5 years since the supernova explosion ) .",
    "the b regions on the blue and red side have maximum angular distances from the center of the remnant of 0.82  and 0.98 , respectively .",
    "these correspond to maximum de - projected distances and radial velocities of 8.6  @xmath6  10@xmath21 cm and 10.0  @xmath6  10@xmath23 km s@xmath4 for the north / blue and 10.4  @xmath6  10@xmath21 cm and 11.9  @xmath6  10@xmath23 km s@xmath4 for the south / red .",
    "the c region has a maximum observed angular extent of 1.37  from the center of the remnant , corresponding to 14.5  @xmath6  10@xmath21 cm and 16.7  @xmath6  10@xmath23 km s@xmath4 assuming free expansion .",
    "@xcite noted that the large observed velocity of the h-@xmath0 at late times ( @xmath3  @xmath24  11  @xmath6  10@xmath23 km s@xmath4 at @xmath15  @xmath25  20 years ) suggests that the reverse shock front has expanded beyond the ring plane .",
    "they conclude that the rs extent in the polar direction is @xmath16  15% larger than the er radius and @xmath16  40% larger than the rs radius in the ring plane .",
    "we find de - projected velocities of 10    12  @xmath6  10@xmath23 km s@xmath4 in the b - b and b - r regions , corresponding to rs radii 40  ",
    "70% larger than the 6.1  @xmath6  10@xmath21 cm ring radius .",
    "the c regions extend to 2    2.5 times the equatorial ring radius . to interpret the high - velocity h-@xmath0 images , we recall that surfaces of constant doppler shift are planar sections of the freely expanding supernova debris . therefore , the pass bands of the `` h-@xmath0 blue '' and `` h-@xmath0 red '' filters map to slabs in physical space , as illustrated in figure 5 . portions of the rs surface visible through the `` h-@xmath0 blue '' filter ( colored blue ) reside within the slab delineated by the blue vertical lines , while those visible through the `` h-@xmath0 red '' filter ( colored red ) reside within the slab delineated by the red vertical lines .",
    "the density of the outer debris crossing the rs front , and therefore the mass flux , is @xmath26  @xmath27  @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "the much higher density of the debris crossing the rs in the equatorial direction relative to the polar direction ( @xmath31/@xmath32  @xmath16  10@xmath33 ) makes the a region much brighter ( detectable spectroscopically within @xmath16  10 years of the explosion ) .",
    "the lower density material flowing out of the ring plane ( b and c regions ) is fainter , only now visible with the dedicated high - velocity h-@xmath0 imaging and sufficient time for the polar shock structure to be angularly separated from the ring plane . while much of the rs surface is not imaged because of the discrete velocity surfaces transmitted through the filters ( shaded gray in figure 5 ) , the emerging picture for the extended h-@xmath0 emission in the off - plane regions suggests a bipolar morphology",
    "this is expected due to the high pressure of the equatorial plane , owing to the presence of the ring  @xcite . assuming the outer ejecta pressure is proportional to @xmath26  @xmath34 , the c polar region pressure is @xmath16  1/1800 of the equatorial region pressure .",
    "this general picture resembles the bipolar surfaces suggested for the pre - supernova interacting wind picture by  @xcite , however , recent studies of a ` pre - explosion twin ' to the sn 1987a system ( sbw1 ; smith et al .",
    "2013 ) suggest that interacting winds may not be required to explain the nebular morphology .",
    "a second possible explanation for the c region emission is a conical or helical structure ( e.g. smith et al .",
    "2007 , 2013 ) connecting the er with the extended outer rings ( ors ) . in this scenario , _ 1 ) _ high - velocity ejecta crossing this structure would be limb - brightened , explaining the bright edges in the c - b and c - r emission , and _ 2 ) _ the southern c - b streaks would be offset to the east compared to the northern c - r streaks by an amount comparable to the e - w offset of the ors ( e.g , sugerman et al . 2005 ) , which is indeed what is observed in figure 2 . in this picture , the c emission would essentially be a new sn  1987a intermediate ring system .",
    "deep h-@xmath0 imaging spectroscopy to map the region could distinguish between these scenarios and may shed light on the progenitor structure , including the possibility of a binary merger prior to the supernova explosion  @xcite .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the contribution of different far - uv emission components to the f122 m image .",
    "interstellar blocks the center of the lyman-@xmath0 line profile over the velocity range @xmath11500 km s@xmath4 @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath2 + 1500 km s@xmath4  @xcite , and so excludes emission from the shocked ring and hotspots , which have doppler shifts @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath2 300 km s@xmath4 ( pun et al 2002 ) . based on the @xmath18-cos spectrum",
    ", we estimate that 90    95% of the total emission in the f122 m image is contributed by high - velocity lyman-@xmath0 . the remaining 5    10% is mostly @xmath19  1240    emission from the er and high - velocity n@xmath37 ions crossing the rs front .",
    "separation of the peak lyman-@xmath0 and er emission is complicated on the bright northern side by the 43  projection on the plane of the sky , however , there is separation between the lyman-@xmath0 and the h-@xmath0 ring profiles in the east - west direction .",
    "the east - west ring diameters are 1.44  ( @xmath17  0.05 ) , 1.62  ( @xmath17  0.05 ) , and 1.63  ( @xmath17  0.10 ) for lyman-@xmath0 , h-@xmath0 er ( f656n ) , and x - ray images , respectively .",
    "the lyman-@xmath0 image is slightly offset with respect to the er , with the largest separation ( 1.35  @xmath6  10@xmath21 cm ) at the western edge ( figure 4 , bottom ) . while the x - ray resolution is not as high as the @xmath18 imaging of the er , there is a clear offset between the x - ray and lyman-@xmath0 profile peaks . unlike the x - ray and lyman-@xmath0 images , which are brightest in the nw quadrant , the radio image  @xcite is brightest in the east .",
    "_ neutral hydrogen mass flux and the lyman-@xmath0/h-@xmath0 ratio    _ if all of the high - velocity hydrogen emission originates from collisional excitation as neutral hydrogen atoms cross the rs front , the total flux is proportional to the fluence of hydrogen atoms across the shock boundary . integrating the individual band images",

    "the role of x - rays    _ the observed offset between the x - ray and lyman-@xmath0 emitting regions is consistent with the expected separation between the er and the outer extent of the rs . following the observation that the dominant energy input in the unshocked supernova debris has evolved from internal heating by radioactive decay to external heating from x - rays produced at the er  @xcite , @xcite presented calculations of the x - ray energy deposition into the ejecta .",
    "the heating of the outer debris is dominated by x - rays with @xmath48  @xmath2 0.5 kev while higher energy x - rays penetrate deeper to heat the interior .",
    "x - rays propagating into the outer debris produce fast photoelectrons , which deposit most of their kinetic energy as heat , provided that the debris has fractional ionization @xmath49 @xmath25 0.03  @xcite .",

    "the spatial stratification of the lyman-@xmath0 and x - ray emission and the enhanced lyman-@xmath0/h-@xmath0 ratio support the scenario where x - ray heating of the outer debris is responsible for the majority of the observed lyman-@xmath0 emission from sn 1987a at present .    the total lyman-@xmath0 luminosity in the f122 m band is @xmath51 = 2.5  ( @xmath17  0.7 )  @xmath6  10@xmath52 erg s@xmath4 ,",
