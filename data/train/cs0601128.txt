    "first case : there exists @xmath134 such that @xmath201 lie between @xmath239 and @xmath240 .",

    "the reason is that , in both cases , the key property , namely that the triangle @xmath219 $ ] has @xmath2-distortion @xmath178 if @xmath201 do not all lie on some arc @xmath251 , fails . with arcs of radius @xmath182",
