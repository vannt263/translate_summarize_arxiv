    "the complex hydrides , @xmath2@xmath3h@xmath1 , @xmath2=mg , ca , sr , eu and @xmath3=fe , ru , os form in the cubic ( @xmath4,#225 ) , k@xmath0ptcl@xmath1 structure .",
    "@xcite this structure has @xmath2 on site 8@xmath5 ( 1/4,1/4,1/4 ) , @xmath3 on 4@xmath6 ( 0,0,0 ) , and h on site 24@xmath7 ( @xmath8,0,0 ) .",
    "these compounds are of fundamental interest because of the unusual structural motif and the interest in understanding resulting electronic structure , and the bonding associated with it .",
    "furthermore , they could be of practical interest as potential hydrogen storage materials .",
    "mg@xmath0feh@xmath1 has very high volume and mass storage efficiency ( 150",
    "g / l and 5.4 wt .",
    "% ) , but is too stable for reversible room temperature applications .",
    "@xcite in this regard , understanding of the electronic structure and cohesion may be helpful in finding modifications that improve the thermodynamics , to produce a material for hydrogen storage in mobile applications .",
    "the crystal structure may be regarded as a cubic double perovskite @xmath9h@xmath1 , with @xmath10 , @xmath11=@xmath3 and @xmath12=vacancy .",
    "therefore , from a structural point of view , the compounds consist of @xmath3h@xmath1 octahedra , well separated by presumably inert @xmath2 ions , whose role is to fill space and donate charge to the @xmath3h@xmath1 units .",
    "the cubic @xmath4 structure is maintained for all these compounds in spite of large variations of the @xmath13 and @xmath11 site cation radii , in contrast to the structural distortions often found in oxide perovskites and double perovskites .",
    "these compounds are insulators , and , like many of the complex hydrides , @xcite follow the 18 electron rule , which says that the number of non - bonded metal electrons plus the number of electrons in the metal - ligand bonds should be 18 . in the simplest view , this would correspond to full @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 shells associated with the [ @xmath3h@xmath1]@xmath18 structural units .",
    "however , miller and co - workers , @xcite have emphasized the importance of ligand field effects in these complex hydrides , and , in fact , the calculated electronic structures for these materials show band gaps within the @xmath16 manifolds , indicating a more complex situation .",
    "@xcite in particular , insulating band structures , in qualitative accord with experiment , resulting from band gaps between crystal field split transition metal @xmath16 manifolds were found in non - self - consistent warped muffin - tin calculations , based on the x@xmath19 method with @xmath20 .    here",
    ", we re - examine the electronic structures , which we obtain using a full - potential , self - consistent linearized augmented planewave ( lapw ) method , and use these results , along with calculations of the formation enthalpies , to discuss the bonding of these materials and possible directions for modifying them to alter their stability .",
    "in addition we discuss the hypothetical materials , pb@xmath0ruh@xmath1 , which was studied as a potential ferroelectric , and be@xmath0feh@xmath1 , which is both in relation to ferroelectricity and to better understand their stability .",
    "as mentioned , the calculations were done within the local density approximation ( lda ) using the general potential linearized augmented planewave ( lapw ) method .",
    "@xcite local orbital extensions @xcite were used to relax the linearization errors for the transition metal @xmath16 states , and to treat the upper semicore levels of the alkaline earth and transition metal atoms .",
    "an lapw sphere radius @xmath21 = 1.1 @xmath22 was used for h in all the compounds .",
    "metal radii of 1.8 @xmath22 were used for mg@xmath0feh@xmath1 and ca@xmath0feh@xmath1 . for sr@xmath0feh@xmath1 ,",
    "metal radii , @xmath23 = 2.0 @xmath22 and @xmath24 = 1.8 @xmath22 were used for sr and fe , respectively . for ca@xmath0ruh@xmath1 and sr@xmath0ruh@xmath1 ,",
    "metal radii of 1.95 @xmath22 were used . for mg@xmath0ruh@xmath1 we used @xmath25 = 1.8 @xmath22 and @xmath26 = 1.9 @xmath22 .",
    "well converged basis sets , defined by @xmath27=6.0 , where @xmath28 is the planewave cut - off were employed .",
    "the brillouin zone sampling during the iteration to self - consistency was done using the special-*k * points method with a @xmath29 mesh , which corresponds to 10 * k*-points in the irreducible wedge .",
    "densities of states were generated using a tetrahedron mesh of 145 * k * points in the wedge .",
    "convergence was tested , both for the zone sampling and basis set size , by repeating some calculations with higher @xmath27=7 and more * k * points ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "based on these tests , the present convergence with respect to these parameters is better than 2 mry / cell for total energies , and better than 1 mry for band energies .",
    "crystal field effects , which are important here , may be expected to be sensitive to the h positions . here",
    "we use lda relaxation to determine the h positions ( given in table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "as may be seen , they are in good agreement with experiment for those compounds for which neutron refinements are available .",
    "table [ table1 ] also gives the full symmetry @xmath31 raman phonon frequency associated with the h internal structural parameter .",
    "raman and inelastic neutron scattering measurements @xcite for mg@xmath0feh@xmath1 yield an experimental frequency of 1873 @xmath32 , in good agreement with the present lda value of 1923 @xmath32 .",
    "the lda frequencies follow the reported trend for h bond stretching modes in infrared data , @xcite decreasing with increasing @xmath2 ionic radius , and increasing with increasing @xmath3 atomic number .",
    "it is interesting to note the increase in frequency from sr@xmath0ruh@xmath1 to sr@xmath0osh@xmath1 . generally , the ionic properties of 4@xmath16 and 5@xmath16 elements are very similar due to relativistic contraction . the main difference , which is also due to relativistic contraction , is that the @xmath14 states are lower relative to the @xmath16 states in the 5@xmath16 series .",
    "this leads to a higher position of the @xmath16 states relative to ligand states in compounds where the transition elements are cations .",
    "the result is reduced covalency .",
    "since covalency softens ionic interactions , the result is a stiffer lattice in 5@xmath16 ionic compounds relative to the corresponding 4@xmath16 compounds .",
    "a good example is the comparison of knbo@xmath33 , which is a good ferroelectric with ktao@xmath33 , which has practically the same lattice parameter , but is not ferroelectric . @xcite",
    "the calculated electronic band structures are shown in figs .",
    "[ bands - fe ] , [ bands - ru ] and [ bands - os ] .",
    "the corresponding electronic densities of states ( dos ) are in figs .",
    "[ dos - fe ] , [ dos - ru ] and [ dos - os ]",
    ". the electronic structures are qualititively similar to those of orgaz and gupta ( ref . ) , in that all the materials are insulating with band gaps within the transition metal @xmath16 bands .",
    "the band structure for all the compounds studied consists of 6 h @xmath34 derived bands , holding 12 electrons , followed by crystal field split transition metal @xmath16 bands .",
    "the @xmath34 band width is largest in the mg compounds , and in the case of mg@xmath0ruh@xmath1 this is sufficient to yield an overlap between the @xmath34 manifold and the lower @xmath16 manifold . in the octahedral crystal field of the h",
    ", the metal @xmath16 bands separate into a 3-fold degenerate ( 6 electrons ) @xmath35 manifold and a 2-fold degenerate ( 4 electrons ) @xmath36 manifold .",
    "the 18 valence electrons then populate the h derived @xmath34 bands and the metal @xmath35 bands ; the insulating gap is between the occupied @xmath35 and the unoccupied @xmath36 manifolds .",
    "since these are gaps within a crystal field split @xmath16-band , lda band gap errors are expected to be small in the absence of strong correlation effects .",
    "@xcite however , we note that the gap is between narrow @xmath16 bands , and so a larger gap may be observed both because of optical dipole selection rules and , in the fe compounds , correlation effects .",
    "the h @xmath34 character of the lowest 6 bands may be seen from the projections of the dos onto the lapw spheres .",
    "the small 1.1 @xmath22 h spheres , used here , imply that most of the charge of h ions will be outside the sphere .",
    "a free h@xmath37 ion , stabilized by a watson sphere ( to approximately represent the madelung field ) of radius 3.01  , would have only 0.45 @xmath7 ( of 2 ) inside a sphere of radius 1.1 @xmath22 . integrating the h @xmath14 projection of the dos over the lowest 6 bands , we obtain from 0.50 @xmath7 ( ca@xmath0ruh@xmath1 and sr@xmath0ruh@xmath1 ) to 0.52 @xmath7 ( sr@xmath0feh@xmath1 ) inside each h sphere , not far from this simple ionic view especially if one allows for a somewhat different breathing .",
    "this is also similar to what was found for naalh@xmath38 .",
    "@xcite thus the basic electronic structure is ionic consisting of h anions and @xmath2 and @xmath3 cations .",
    "these compounds should therefore be viewed as ionic for understanding the crystal cohesion .",
    "however , from the stand - point of understanding the electronic structure and h storage properties , covalency is important .",
    "the effects of @xmath3  h hybridization are clearly seen in the electronic structures .",
    "while the bottom 6 bands are essentially h @xmath34 bands , they contain the two formally bonding h @xmath14 - @xmath3 @xmath36 @xmath39 combinations ( as well as four non - bonding combinations ) .",
    "the lowest band is the symmetric combination of @xmath14 orbitals , which is a non - bonding combination with @xmath3 @xmath36 states , but is formally bonding with the nominally unoccuppied @xmath3 @xmath14 states .",
    "this is followed by five more h @xmath14 bands , including the non - bonding and the formally bonding h @xmath14 - @xmath3 @xmath36 @xmath39 combinations . in terms of degeneracies , this division into a ",
    "@xmath14\"-like one fold symmetric band , a five - fold manifold and the three - fold @xmath35 manifold is formally like the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 electron counting of the 18-electron rule .",
    "however , this counting does not correspond to atomic level filling . instead , the 2-electron  @xmath14 \" and 10-electron  @xmath16 \" manifolds are actually from combinations of hydrogen @xmath14 states , and are therefore very different in atomic character from the 6-electron ,  @xmath15 \" group , which comes from very weakly hybridized @xmath3 @xmath35 bands .",
    "the lowest conduction bands derive mainly from the corresponding antibonding combinations and @xmath40 derived states associated with the @xmath2 cation .",
    "the covalency in the [ @xmath3h@xmath1]@xmath18 units can be seen in the @xmath3 @xmath16 contributions to the h @xmath14 bands , for example .",
    "the @xmath35 bands show much less hybridization , as expected in an octahedral ligand environment . it should be emphasized that the bands show relatively little dispersion , with the exception of the @xmath2=mg compounds , and that there are generally clean gaps between the different manifolds ( h @xmath14 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) , which implies that weakly interacting [ @xmath3h@xmath1]@xmath18 units may be regarded as the basic building blocks for understanding the band structure .",
    "the sizable crystal field splitting of the @xmath3 @xmath16 bands underlies the 18-electron rule in these compounds .",
    "in particular , without it the @xmath35 and @xmath36 manifolds would overlap , and then there would be no barrier to adding more than 18 electrons ; the 18 electron rule here is the result of the crystal field splitting of the metal @xmath16 levels .",
    "the octahedral geometry , with its large ligand field is energetically favorable for 18 or fewer electrons .",
    "@xcite the substantial crystal field splittings ( as compared to the on - site hund s coupling , which can be characterized by a stoner @xmath41 ev for fe ) @xcite are responsible for the low spin fe observed in these compounds .    to summarize the results so far , the electronic structure is built up in the following way in decreasing order of the size of the interactions involved .",
    "( 1 ) coulomb interactions , particularly the madelung field , stabilize an ionic configuration , nominally @xmath42h@xmath43 .",
    "this is the main ingredient in the cohesion . ( 2 ) hybridization between the h @xmath14 orbitals and the @xmath3 @xmath36 orbitals lead to a bonding anti - bonding splitting between these and contribute to a substantial crystal field splitting between weakly hybridized occupied @xmath3 @xmath35 states and unnoccupied @xmath3 @xmath36 states .",
    "this splitting and the position of the @xmath2 derived states well above the @xmath35 energy underlies the 18 electron rule .",
    "( 3 ) hopping between the [ @xmath3h@xmath1]@xmath18 units ( presumably mostly assisted hopping via unnoccipied @xmath2 @xmath14 and @xmath16 states ) leads to band formation .",
    "this is reminiscent of some of the oxide double perovskites , @xmath44o@xmath1 , with an inert @xmath45 , such as sr@xmath0ruyo@xmath1 , although in that case the hybridization inside the [ ruo@xmath1]@xmath46 units is very much stronger than in the present hydrides .",
    "the resulting picture of ionic crystal with substantial covalency between anions and an octahedrally coordinated transition element cation suggests similarities with double perovskite oxides .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the latttice contains a large anion ( h@xmath37 ) stabilized by the madelung field and hybridized with nominally unoccupied transition metal states further suggests connections with perovskite oxides , particularly ferroelectrics .",
    "in fact , many of the technologically important ferroelectrics are based on perovskites @xmath47o@xmath33 with mixtures of metal atoms on the @xmath11 sites ( these can be disordered or ordered as in _ e.g. _ double perovskite ) .",
    "examples include pzt [ pb(zr , ti)o@xmath33 ] , pmn - pt [ pb(mg , nb , ti)o@xmath33 ] and pzn - pt [ pb(zn , nb , ti)o@xmath33 ] . in these materials",
    "both pb - o and @xmath11-o hybridization is important in the ferroelectricity .",
    "@xcite    in order to further elucidate the relationship to oxides , we calculated those zone center phonon frequencies of sr@xmath0ruh@xmath1 compatible with a rhombohedral @xmath49 symmetry , and compare with similar calculations for hypothetical pb@xmath0ruh@xmath1 .",
    "this was done at the experimental lattice parameter of sr@xmath0ruh@xmath1 , using the relaxed h position .",
    "this non - centrosymmetric group would include the ferroelectric mode , if the material were ferroelectric .",
    "the calculations were done by fitting the dynamical matrix to a series of frozen phonon calculations with small displacements of the various atoms .",
    "this yields 6 three - fold degenerate modes ( plus the three @xmath50 acoustic modes ) .",
    "the frequencies and displacement patterns of the phonon modes are given in table [ f - table1 ] .",
    "the 2 % difference between the @xmath31 frequencies for sr@xmath0ruh@xmath1 between tables [ table1 ] and [ f - table1 ] reflect the different approaches and should be considered indicative of the errors in the fits used in constructing the dynamical matrix .",
    "the fitting errors can also be seen in the deviation of the mode character as given in table [ f - table1 ] from the @xmath51 character required by symmetry . for the @xmath51 frequency ,",
    "the value in table [ table1 ] should be considered more reliable because that value was obtained enforcing the exact mode symmetry , but it should be kept in mind that the lda error is likely larger than the difference between the values in tables [ table1 ] and [ f - table1 ] .",
    "the highest frequency branches correspond to h motions , as expected . of these",
    ", the @xmath51 raman mode , which corresponds to symmetric breathing of the ruh@xmath1 octahedra , is the stiffest mode , and the next lower mode also involves modulation of the ru - h bond lengths .",
    "the two intermediate modes ( 738 @xmath32 and 777 @xmath32 ) involve distortion of the octahedra , which would also yield lower frequency modes in oxides .",
    "the two lowest frequency modes are motions of the sr atoms within their cages .",
    "the lowest mode is the antisymmetric motion of the sr , which is not ferroelectric .",
    "the frequencies of these sr motions are compatible with the frequencies of the shearing modes that modulate sr - h distances when the mass difference is accounted for .",
    "this pattern of phonon modes is quite different from what would occur in an oxide near ferroelectricity . in that case",
    ", there would be a low frequency cooperative mode .",
    "this would consist of a distortion where the cations move relative to the o atoms comprising the octahedra , reflecting the high polarizability of the octahedra softened by covalent interactions .",
    "@xcite here , the mode corresponding to motion of the ru with respect to the h is at high frequency ( 1433 @xmath32 ) and the lower frequency sr derived modes have only a small component of ru motion relative to the h octahedra .",
    "we repeated the calculations for the hypothetical compound pb@xmath0ruh@xmath1 . in perovskite and double perovskite oxides ,",
    "pb typically can be substituted for sr .",
    "the pb compounds typically have unit cell volumes very close to the sr analagues , but are more likely to be ferroelectric because of pb - o covalency ( e.g. pbtio@xmath33 vs. srtio@xmath33 ) .",
    "since the experimental lattice parameter of pb@xmath0ruh@xmath1 is unavailable , we used the value for sr@xmath0ruh@xmath1 .",
    "this choice also makes comparison of the two systems more direct .",
    "lda relaxation of the lattice parameter yielded a value 1.8% smaller than this , but considering the usual underestimate of lattice parameters in the lda , we do not consider the lda value to be more reliable than the use of the sr@xmath0ruh@xmath1 value .",
    "@xcite the pb@xmath0ruh@xmath1 modes ( table [ f - table2 ] ) are qualitatively like those of sr@xmath0ruh@xmath1 , except that the low frequency pb modes are shifted down in frequency .",
    "this shift is , however , larger than can be accounted for by the mass difference , and the modes are reversed in order .",
    "the lowest mode is now the symmetric mode and it is at zero frequency to within the precision of the present calculations .",
    "we also calculated the energy as a function of the rotation of the ruh@xmath1 octahedron .",
    "such rotational degrees of freedom compete with ferroelectricity in ferroelectrics such as pb(zr , ti)o@xmath33 .",
    "@xcite here , these modes are stable .",
    "we obtain frequencies of 576 @xmath32 and 490 @xmath32 , for sr@xmath0ruh@xmath1 and pb@xmath0ruh@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "this suggests pb@xmath0ruh@xmath1 as a candidate ferroelectric hydride .",
    "we found a similar result for hypothetical be@xmath0feh@xmath1 . in this case",
    ", we obtained a slightly unstable mode of be character , with a ferroelectric displacement pattern , and stable rotational and antiferroelectric modes .",
    "if these compounds are made , the possibility of ferroelectricity should be investigated , _",
    "e.g. _ by low temperature structural studies and temperature dependent dielectric measurements .",
    "in order to better understand the stability of these compounds , we performed calculations of the formation enthalpies by comparison of the total energies with those of decomposition products . specifically , we did calculations for the elements , mg , sr , ca , fe , ru and os in their bulk metallic form ( in the lda at the experimental lattice parameters , parallel to the calculations done for the hydrides , including ferromagnetism for fe ) , the h@xmath0 molecule ( relaxed , in the lda ) and mgh@xmath0 , cah@xmath0 and srh@xmath0 ( using experimental lattice constants , but relaxed atomic positions ) .",
    "in addition calculations were done for elemental be and the intermetallic phase be@xmath0fe , which is the expected decomposition product of the hypothetical phase be@xmath0feh@xmath1 ( see below ) .    for the h@xmath0 molecule we used a cubic supercell of lattice parameter 4.5  .",
    "this yielded an lda energy of -2.288 ry , and bond length of 0.765  , and bond stretching vibrational frequency of 4217 @xmath32 .",
    "these results are in good agreement with previous lda calculations .",
    "for example , patton and co - workers report a vibrational frequency of 4188 @xmath32 and bond length of 0.765  .",
    "@xcite the h@xmath0 zero point energy obtained from the lda frequency is 25.2 kj / mol .",
    "this is a substantial number , which underscores the fact @xcite that zero point effects need to be considered in the thermodynamics of hydride formation .",
    "here we neglect metal modes , and consider only the h contribution to the zero point energies , which we write as @xmath52 per h@xmath0 unit , where @xmath53 is an average h vibrational frequency .",
    "the effective @xmath53 for h@xmath0 is 703 @xmath32 , so for hydrides with @xmath54 @xmath32 , zero point motion will reduce the formation energy , and the corresponding deuterides and tritides will form more easily than the hydrides , while for materials with @xmath55 @xmath32 , the converse will be true .",
    "@xcite at least in principle , this difference can be used to obtain the average h frequency from experimental formation energies of hydrides and deuterides , but to our knowledge this has not been done for these materials .    in order to estimate @xmath53 for the compounds considered here , we performed lda calculations for selected distortions and assumed that the h behaves in an einstein - like way .",
    "in particular , for mgh@xmath0 , we displaced a single h in the unit cell ( which contains 4 equivalent h atoms ) along the three principal directions in its cage and averaged the resulting frequencies to obtain an average frequency ( the principal directions relative to the lattice are [ 1,@xmath56,0 ] , [ 1,1,0 ] and [ 0,0,1 ] ) .",
    "for cah@xmath0 and srh@xmath0 , we used the average of the four full symmetry raman modes that are h derived ( there are two other such modes associated with metal motion ) .",
    "for the k@xmath0ptcl@xmath1 structure hydrides , we used the average of the highest two @xmath57-point modes consistent with rhombohedral symmetry ( the highest of these is the full symmetry raman breathing mode ) to obtain an effective @xmath11-site metal ",
    "h bond stretching force constant ( which contributes 1/3 of the modes ) and obtained the effective force constant for the other two thirds of the modes by averaging the two other h derived modes from the rhombohedral symmetry and the octahedral rotation mode . as a test",
    ", we also calculated an average einstein frequency for mg@xmath0feh@xmath1 by displacing a single h ( of the six in the unit cell ) perpendicular to the fe - h  bond \" , and along it , similar to the procedure that was followed for mgh@xmath0 .",
    "this yielded a shear frequency of 727 @xmath32 and a stretch frequency of 1828 @xmath32 , for an average @xmath53=1094 @xmath32 , in fortuitously good agreement with the estimate of 1089 @xmath32 , made as above ( table [ table3 ] ) . in all cases ,",
    "the averages are arithmatical averages of frequencies as is appropriate for the zero point energy .",
    "@xmath19-mgh@xmath0 has a tetragonal structure ( spacegroup @xmath58 ) with one h coordinate , @xmath59 .",
    "we obtain @xmath59=0.3046 , in agreeement with the recent neutron measurement of bortz and co - workers , @xcite who obtained @xmath59=0.3040 , and an lda calculation by yu and lam , @xcite who also obtained @xmath59=0.304 . moving a single hydrogen in the unit cell of mgh@xmath0 , we obtained frequencies of 1277 @xmath32 along [ 1,1,0 ] ( bond stretching ) 592 @xmath32 along [ 1,@xmath56,0 ] ( bond bending ) and 993 @xmath32 along [ 0,0,1 ] ( mixed ) . the bond stretching ",
    "einstein \" frequency is near that of the full symmetry raman mode , which we obtain at 1301 @xmath32 and which is also of bond stretching character .",
    "this supports the simple einstein - like approach used .",
    "good agreement with neutron diffraction results @xcite is also obtained for the internal structural parameters of cah@xmath0 and srh@xmath0 , which occur in an orthorhombic @xmath60 structure , as given in table [ table2 ] .",
    "as mentioned , the full symmetry raman frequencies obtained from this relaxation , were used to construct the h frequency for the zero point contribution to the enthalpy of these compounds .",
    "lda formation energies are given in table [ table3 ] .",
    "the formation energies of mgh@xmath0 , cah@xmath0 and srh@xmath0 are in excellent agreement with experiment and also in good agreement with previous lda calculations .",
    "@xcite the formation energy of mg@xmath0feh@xmath1 is the best studied of the k@xmath0ptcl@xmath1 hydrides , and is reported as -98 kj / mol ( ref . ) , -86 kj / mol ( ref . ) , and -77.4 kj / mol ( ref . ) .",
    "the calculated lda energy of -133 kj / mol is significantly larger and this difference would seem to be at the high end of the normal range of lda errors , especially considering the good agreement with experiment for mgh@xmath0 , and feal , where we obtain agreement with experiment to within 5 kj / mol of fe .",
    "@xcite besides lda errors , the most likely source of error is the crude method that we used to obtain an average phonon frequency . however , even if the average phonon frequency were 250 @xmath32 higher than our estimate , which we think is unlikely , the calculated enthalpy would shift by only 9 kj / mol of h@xmath0 .",
    "one possibility is that some of the difference is experimental in origin , related to the possible existence of some stable hydride among the decomposition products , which would then stabilize the products relative to mg@xmath0feh@xmath1 and therefore would lower the formation energy as measured by the decomposition . in any case , we do find certain trends .",
    "first of all , mg@xmath0feh@xmath1 is by far the least stable of the k@xmath0ptcl@xmath1 hydrides studied .",
    "however , this is connected with the fact that mgh@xmath0 is much less stable than srh@xmath0 or cah@xmath0 .",
    "if one considers formation via @xmath61 , then this heat of formation is largest for mg@xmath0feh@xmath1 as might be expected from an ionic picture .",
    "secondly , the formation energy per h@xmath0 is significantly larger for mg@xmath0feh@xmath1 than for mgh@xmath0 .",
    "this implies that under thermodynamic conditions , without some very unusual entropy contribution , the decomposition should proceed directly to h@xmath0 and the elements , or , at a bare minimum , if there is an intermediate hydride phase , it should not be mgh@xmath0 .",
    "the formation energies of the ca and sr compounds on the other hand are very close to those of cah@xmath0 and srh@xmath0 , so depending on the conditions , those decompositions may very well proceed via an intermediate @xmath3 + @xmath2h@xmath0 .",
    "similar calculations were done for the other compounds in order to estimate the h zero point energy , but these were at a lower level of convergence in the fitting of the dynamical matrix .",
    "we now speculate about possible implications of our results for hydrogen storage .",
    "first of all , we note that the cohesion is ionic , and that it is the madelung field that stabilizes the [ @xmath3h@xmath1]@xmath18 units .",
    "changes in the coulomb potential then ought to strongly affect the bond lengths in these units as well as their stability .",
    "this is already apparent in the values of @xmath8 of table [ table1 ] , which show substantial changes in the @xmath3-h bond lengths as the lattice parameter is changed by @xmath2 site substitution ( note that the octahedra are not connected so that they need not breath with the lattice ) .",
    "this implies significant tunability in the properties with substitutions .",
    "secondly , the ionic stabilization of the lattice implies that mixed @xmath3 cation substitutions should be possible and that the octahedral coordination of the metal atoms will be preserved in them .",
    "for example , if the partial or full substution os @xmath62 @xmath63 re + @xmath63 ir could be made , its structure is expected to feature reh@xmath1 and irh@xmath1 octahedra , rather than different re - h and ir - h coordinations on this lattice .",
    "however , it is unclear if any of these substitutions can be made , and even if they can it is unclear whether they will be beneficial .",
    "finally , we note that the fully hydrided compound can therefore be destabilized by driving the transition metal @xmath16 states up in energy via the madelung potential , if all other things were equal",
    ". one way would be to substitute some fraction of the mg with a monovalent cation if one can be made to enter the lattice .    however , the stability is relative to the decomposed products , and it is clear from the calculated energetics that these play a major role .",
    "for example , mg@xmath0ruh@xmath1 and mg@xmath0feh@xmath1 are the least stable compounds relative to decomposition into elemental mg and ru or fe , but they are the most stable with respect to a hypothetical intermediate mgh@xmath0 + fe / ru . as mentioned , this suggests that under normal conditions mg@xmath0feh@xmath1 and mg@xmath0ruh@xmath1 decompose into h@xmath0 and elemental metals without any mgh@xmath0 intermediate , consistent with the observation of bogdanovic and co - workers .",
    "considering the trend in the energetics with respect to the alkaline earth element , one possibility for obtaining a lower formation energy would seem to be replacement of mg by be .",
    "this would seem especially likely considering the properties of be metal , which include strong bonding that would compete with the formation of hydride phases . in order to check this trend we performed calculations for hypothetical be@xmath0feh@xmath1 to obtain its formation energy .",
    "since the compound is hypothetical , we obtained the lattice parameter by relaxation in the lda .",
    "the calculated structure has a lattice parameter of 5.65  , a h internal coordinate of @xmath59=0.2648 , and a corresponding full symmetry raman phonon frequency of 2233 @xmath32 .",
    "no doubt the lda underestimates the lattice parameter slightly , as is typical . in any case , with the lda structure , we obtain a static formation enthalpy of -37 kj / mol h@xmath0 with respect to elemental products .",
    "this confirms the conjecture that be would lead to lower binding energies .",
    "however , while this energy suggests that be@xmath0feh@xmath1 would be an interesting hydride phase , it neglects the fact that unlike mg , be forms compounds with fe .",
    "in particular , febe@xmath0 is a known intermetallic compound and would compete with the hydride phase .",
    "we calculated the enthalpy of formation of febe@xmath0 ( details are in the next section ) and find -87 kj / mol .",
    "the relevant energy for the stability of the hydride be@xmath0feh@xmath1 is therefore not the formation enthalpy from the elements , but from the intermetallic , befe@xmath0 , which , with h@xmath0 , would be the product of the decomposition .",
    "relative to decomposition into the elements , the existence of the intermetallic then results in a shift of the formation enthalpy of be@xmath0feh@xmath1 by 29 kj / mol on a per h@xmath0 basis , to yield -8 kj / mol .",
    "the average phonon frequency , determined as for the other k@xmath0ptcl@xmath1 hydrides , discussed above , is 1172 @xmath32 , yielding a zero point correction of + 17kj / mol h@xmath0 , placing the calculated enthalpy including zero point at + 9 kj / mol .",
    "thus , it is likely that be@xmath0feh@xmath1 is marginally unstable with respect to decomposition into febe@xmath0 , and therefore will only be formed under high pressure or by chemical routes .",
    "febe@xmath0 is an interesting hard magnetic material . in particular , it has a relatively low density , high anisotropy and a very high curie temperature , @xmath64 of 880 k. @xcite experimentally , febe@xmath0 crystallizes in the hexagonal mgzn@xmath0 structure ( spacegroup @xmath65 , no .",
    "194 ) and has magnetization , @xmath66/fe . since we are not aware of previous first principles studies of this material , we briefly summarize our results for the electronic structure of this compound .",
    "the reported lattice parameters are @xmath6=4.215  , and @xmath5=6.853  .",
    "@xcite the unit cell contains four formula units .",
    "the be atoms are on sites @xmath67 ( 0,0,0 ) and @xmath68 ( @xmath59,2@xmath59,1/4 ) , while the fe atoms are on @xmath69 ( 1/3,2/3,z ) .",
    "experimental values of the two internal parameters are not available from experiment , so they were found by structural relaxation in the lda .",
    "we find @xmath59= 0.8294 and @xmath70=0.061 .",
    "the calculated lda spin magnetization is 1.76 @xmath71/fe and the magnetic energy is 0.237 ev / fe .",
    "this is only @xmath72 suggesting some itinerant character .",
    "the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) band structure and density of states are given in figures [ befe - bands ] and [ befe - dos ] .",
    "the band structures shows narrow crystal field split fe 3@xmath16 bands on top of a broad manifold of free electron like be @xmath73 derived bands .",
    "these be derived bands are weakly polarized , opposite to the fe polarization , similar to the case of yfe@xmath0 , for example .",
    "@xcite the majority spin fe 3@xmath16 bands are fully occupied , while the fermi energy falls in the crystal field gap between the @xmath35 and @xmath36 manifolds in the minority spin .",
    "this yields two minority spin @xmath36 holes per fe , and explains the @xmath74 2 @xmath71/fe magnetization .",
    "relative to @xmath75 fe , there is a transfer of fe @xmath14 character to the be derived bands , and a back transfer of charge to give effectively neutral fe , with eight 3@xmath16 electrons .",
    "this is consistent with the picture discussed by jesser and vincze based on experimental susceptibility and mossbauer measurements .",
    "@xcite this pseudogapped band structure yields a relatively low density of states at the fermi energy in both spin channels , @xmath76=0.39 ev@xmath77 and @xmath78=0.67 ev@xmath77 on a per formula unit basis .",
    "the calculated formation energy of febe@xmath0 is -87 kj / mol on a per formula unit basis . as a test of our approach",
    ", we also calculated the formation energy of feal in the same way .",
    "the result was -77 kj / mol(feal ) , which is in good agreement with the experimental value of -72.6 kj / mol .",
    "@xcite this suggests that the error in the formation energy of febe@xmath0 is likely in the range of 5 kj / mol .",
    "the present density functional calculations show that the k@xmath0ptcl@xmath1 hydrides are ionic compounds , with some covalency .",
    "the 18 electron rule is a consequence of ligand field effects on the transition metal site .",
    "this type of ionic character suggests the possibility of ferroelectricity in related hydrides .",
    "we find that the hypothetical compounds , pb@xmath0ruh@xmath1 and be@xmath0feh@xmath1 are on the borderline of ferroelectricity , and should be investigated in this context , if they can be made .",
    "further , the ionic character stabilizes h anions , and fe cations , which is why fe participates in hydride formation , although fe metal is not a hydride former .",
    "the ionic character implies a certain degree of tunability of the properties of these hydrides , which may allow adjustment of the thermodynamics .",
    "however , since fe and mg do not form intermetallic compounds , it is likely that the properties of mg@xmath0feh@xmath1 can not be made better for vehicular h storage than those of mgh@xmath0 , since mgh@xmath0 will be a competing phase .",
    "one way to reduce the stability of the hydride without facing this limitation would be to focus on the stability of decomposition products .",
    "one possibility would be to explore minor additions , @xmath79 that are soluble in and stabilize an fe - mg-@xmath79 intermetallic .",
    "these need not enter the hydride lattice , provided that they are available e.g. on hydride particle surfaces to promote the decomposition and provide sufficient enthalpy via the formation of the intermetallic . this may be the most promising avenue for modifying mg@xmath0feh@xmath1 for hydrogen storage applications .",
    "as far as we are aware , the solubility of mg in febe@xmath0 is not known . however",
    ", if fe - be - mg intermetallics are stable , the present results suggest that the addition of be to mg@xmath0feh@xmath1 may lead to lower stability , which if not for the toxicity of be , would be favorable for applications .",

    "might also be thought to be favorable as it is also a geometry that is favorable for large large ligand field splittings and hybridization , but in that case only up to 12 electrons would be accomodated  8 in the 4 h @xmath34 orbitals and 4 in the now lower @xmath36 manifold .",
    "however , this is not compatible with the electron count of fe and mg .                            the most probable source of error is in the magnetic energy of elemental fe , which is likely underestimated in the lda .",
