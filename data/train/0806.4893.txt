    "bloch oscillations of becs in optical lattices have been studied theoretically  @xcite and observed experimentally  @xcite in various configurations . in this paper , we focus on the systematic investigation of the role of the mean field in bloch oscillations in harmonic potentials . we find that the stability of the bec during the oscillations depends on the interplay between the inhomogeneity of the applied force and the mean field . in recent experiments on bloch oscillations driven by a constant external force , the mean field was shown to cause momentum dispersion of the bec  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in bloch oscillations in an approximately harmonic magnetic trap , this dispersion can be suppressed by the mean field  @xcite .",
    "all of these findings are consistently described by the results in this paper .",

    "at zero temperature and in the limit of weak excitation , the bec wavefunction , @xmath0 , can be described by the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation  @xcite , @xmath1\\psi(\\textbf{r},t ) \\,,\\label{gp}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the atomic mass , @xmath3 is the total atom number , @xmath4 is the external potential and @xmath5 characterizes the strength of the mean - field interaction between the atoms , defined as @xmath6 , with @xmath7 being the s - wave scattering length of the atom .",
    "we assume that the bec is confined in a cylindrically symmetric harmonic trap , which can be written as @xmath8 using cylindrical coordinates @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , an optical lattice is applied to the bec in the direction of the axis of symmetry , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the wavelength of the lattice laser . in the case of zero angular momentum about the symmetry axis",

    "we fix the @xmath23 coordinate and solve eq .",
    "[ gp3 ] using the standard 1d crank - nicholson method . in the second step , the resultant @xmath15",
    "is entered into eq .",
    "[ gp4 ] as the initial wavefunction to calculate the time evolution in the @xmath23-direction while the @xmath24 coordinate is fixed , again using the 1d crank - nicholson method .",
    "the time and spatial increments used in our simulations are 100  ns and 50  nm , respectively .",
    "a detailed discussion of this variation of the crank - nicholson method for solving the 2d gp equation can be found in refs .",
    "in close analogy with our recent experiment  @xcite , we consider a bec with a fixed number of @xmath25rb atoms confined in a cylindrically symmetric harmonic trap , with trap frequencies @xmath26  hz and @xmath27  hz in the radial and axial directions , respectively . in the simulations , the atoms are adiabatically loaded into an optical lattice with a depth of one recoil energy , formed by two counter - propagating laser beams in the @xmath23-direction with wavelength @xmath11=  852  nm .",
    "then , at time @xmath28  0 , the harmonic trap is suddenly shifted in the @xmath23-direction . to obtain the wavefunction immediately before the shift , we start with the bec wavefunction in the 3d harmonic potential without optical lattice in the absence of a mean field , given by the well - known ground state of the harmonic potential",
    ". the ground state of the bec including optical lattice and mean field is then obtained by gradually ramping up the optical - lattice and mean - field potentials to their full strengths over an interval of 100  ms , using the formalism described in eqs .",
    "( [ gp3 ] ) and ( [ gp4 ] ) .",
    "the initial bec wavefunction for 25000 atoms is shown in fig .",
    "[ iw ] ( a ) .    after obtaining the initial wavefunction ,",
    "the magnetic trap is shifted at time @xmath28  0 in the @xmath23-direction by a distance of @xmath29 , leading to the initial condition shown in fig .",
    "[ iw ]  ( b ) .",
    "the resulting bec motion depends on @xmath29 , and can be broken into several regimes . if @xmath29 is small enough that the bec never gains enough momentum to come close to the edge of the first brillouin zone , the bec performs small oscillations about the minimum of the harmonic trap . for large @xmath29 , the bec periodically traverses the entire first brillouin zone .",
    "the bec motion is similar to a bloch oscillation , except that the bec experiences an inhomogeneous rather than a constant force . the critical displacement , @xmath30 , for bragg reflection and bloch oscillations to occur follows from the requirement that the bec must reach at least one recoil energy , @xmath31 , when passing through the minimum of the harmonic trap ( with no lattice ) . under our conditions , @xmath32  khz and @xmath33  17.1  @xmath34 m .",
    "there is also an intermediate regime in which only a portion of the bec undergoes bragg reflection . in this paper , we focus on the dynamics of the bec when @xmath35 and study how the mean field affects the bec during bloch oscillations .    the initial displacement @xmath29 is set to be 30  @xmath34 m . to visualize the bec dynamics",
    ", we perform a fourier transform  @xcite on the wavefunction @xmath36 and plot the momentum distribution of the bec as a function of time .",
    "four different atom numbers are used in the simulations .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ bloch ] ( a)-(d ) for @xmath3=0 ( experimentally , this would be equivalent to a vanishing scattering length ) , 2000 , 25000 , and 60000 , respectively .",
    "the radial ( axial ) momentum spread of the bec is given by the vertical ( horizontal ) width of the spots in fig .",
    "[ bloch ] .",
    "the momentum plots at different times @xmath37 are stacked in the vertical direction . in the following discussion ,",
    "we focus on the @xmath23-degree of freedom , in which most of the interesting dynamics occur . as seen in fig .",
    "[ bloch ] , the bec periodically scans the first brillouin zone and is bragg - reflected at times when it reaches one recoil momentum , @xmath38 . since the bec experiences a near - constant force during the oscillations , its momentum varies at a near - constant rate and the overall motion resembles that of a bloch oscillation .    comparing the bloch oscillations for different atom numbers , shown in fig .",
    "[ bloch ] ( a)-(d ) , we notice that without the mean field ( @xmath3=0 in fig .",
    "[ bloch ] ( a ) ) , the bec displays a significantly larger amount of momentum dispersion than in the cases when the mean field is included . while the mean field with @xmath39 , shown in fig .",
    "[ bloch ] ( c ) , seems to greatly suppress this momentum dispersion , mean - field - induced structure starts to appear in momentum space for @xmath40 in fig .",
    "[ bloch ] ( d ) .",
    "to better view the momentum dispersion , we plot the atomic density as a function of @xmath41 after integrating over @xmath42 , the momentum in the @xmath24-direction .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ mw ] ( a)-(d ) , corresponding to t=0  ms and 15  ms in fig .",
    "[ bloch ] ( a)-(d ) , respectively .",
    "we evaluate the full width half maximum , @xmath43 , of each curve using a gaussian fit . in fig .",
    "[ mw ] ( a ) , with @xmath44  0 , @xmath43 increases by a factor of more than five from t=0  ms to t=15  ms .",
    "this dispersion is due to the fact that the force across the condensate is not uniform .",
    "atoms farther away from the center of the harmonic trap experience a larger force during the oscillation , thus reaching @xmath38 earlier than atoms closer to the center .",
    "this effect initiates a breathing motion of the bec wavepacket in coordinate space and causes the momentum of the bec to spread as well .",
    "this explanation is supported by an additional simulation in which , for @xmath45 , the @xmath23-component of the harmonic trap is replaced by a constant force . in this case , the bec wavepacket does not disperse during bloch oscillations in either coordinate or momentum spaces .",
    "the latter result is confirmed by recent experiments elsewhere  @xcite , in which more than 10000 bloch oscillations are observed when the bec experiences a constant external force and the atomic interaction is tuned to 0 through a feshbach resonance .",
    "the momentum dispersion is greatly suppressed when a moderate mean field is included in the simulation . for @xmath3=2000 , shown in fig .",
    "[ mw ] ( b ) , @xmath43 increases by a factor of less than two over 15  ms .",
    "when @xmath3 reaches 25000 , there is no significant momentum dispersion over 15  ms , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ mw ] ( c ) . to qualitatively explain these results",
    ", we consider the mean field potential @xmath46 within the thomas - fermi approximation . before the shift ,",
    "the bec has a spatially constant chemical potential , @xmath34 , given by @xmath47 therefore , @xmath48 inside the bec . immediately after the shift , as shown in fig .",
    "[ iw ]  ( b ) , the bec experiences a total potential @xmath49 @xmath50 the total force on the bec , @xmath51 , is given by @xmath52 according to eq .",
    "[ force ] , with the mean field included , the bec experiences a constant total force when displaced from the center of the harmonic trap . in this way , the mean field helps stabilize the bec wavepacket during the bloch oscillations .",
    "the validity of the thomas - fermi approximation requires the mean - field potential to dominate the external potential . in our case , the approximation is valid for @xmath53 but not for @xmath54 .",
    "based on the above argument , when a constant external force is applied to the bec , the mean field will cause momentum dispersion . to test this ,",
    "we simulate bloch oscillations under a constant force of the same magnitude as that caused by a @xmath55  @xmath56 shift of the trap .",
    "the corresponding simulation results are shown in fig .",
    "[ blochforce ] ( a ) , where momentum dispersion is clearly seen .",
    "this has also been observed experimentally elsewhere  @xcite . to expand on our argument",
    ", we simulate the dynamics of the bec under two other conditions with the same initial wavefunction as before . in the first case , at t=0 the harmonic potential in the @xmath23-direction",
    "is first shifted by @xmath57 m and then switched to an anti - trap . since the mean field now enhances the inhomogeneity of the effective force acting on the bec , we expect faster momentum dispersion , which is verified by simulation results presented in fig .  [ blochforce ] ( b ) .",
    "the second case has the same initial conditions as the first , except that the harmonic potential in the @xmath24-direction is also changed to an anti - trap and the atomic interaction is made attractive . in this case , the momentum dispersion is expected to be suppressed again because the total force due to the harmonic potential and mean field is again constant . in fig .",
    "[ blochforce ] ( c ) , no momentum dispersion is seen over several bloch oscillations , as anticipated .",
    "eventually , the bec oscillation becomes unstable due to the intrinsic instability of becs with negative scattering length .",
    "for the conditions studied in this paper , an increase of the mean field beyond values corresponding to @xmath58 causes discrete peaks to appear in the bec momentum distribution , as seen in fig .",
    "[ bloch ] ( d ) .",
    "this indicates that the internal structure of the bec wavefunction has been disturbed .",
    "we plot the corresponding bec density , @xmath59 , in fig .",
    "[ wave ] ( a ) , and can see dark stripes within the bec .",
    "these dark stripes are solitons created by the bec standing wave formed during bragg reflection  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , considering the structure of the lowest energy band of the optical lattice , the soliton formation can be attributed to the anomalous dispersion  @xcite or negative effective mass  @xcite of the bec near the band edge . the solitons decay into vortices as the oscillation goes on .",
    "the creation of solitons and vortices during bloch oscillations was first reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this section ,",
    "we show that the initial displacement @xmath29 has a considerable impact on this phenomenon .",
    "figures  [ bloch1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) show the bec momentum distributions for @xmath60 m and @xmath61 m , respectively , both with @xmath3=60000 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ bloch1 ] ( a ) , the bec momentum starts to develop structure along the @xmath23-direction after a single bragg reflection . in fig .",
    "[ bloch1 ] ( b ) , a single bragg reflection causes even more structure in the bec momentum distribution . additionally taking into account the results shown in fig .",
    "[ bloch ] ( d ) , we conclude that a smaller @xmath29 leads to a faster creation of solitons and vortices .",
    "this observation can be explained as follows .",
    "since it is the standing wave formed during the bragg reflection that leads to the creation of solitons and vortices , it is reasonable to assume that the standing wave duration , @xmath62 , facilitates the soliton formation .",
    "the duration @xmath62 can also be thought of as the bragg reflection time , which is determined by how fast the bec passes through the anti - crossing region between the two lowest energy bands of the optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath62 is proportional to @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the force applied to the bec .",
    "smaller displacements @xmath29 ( under the condition @xmath65 ) lead to smaller @xmath64 and larger @xmath62 , which causes the solitons and vortices to appear earlier , as observed in the simulations .",
    "around 14  ms in fig .",
    "[ bloch1 ] ( a ) and 10  ms in fig .",
    "[ bloch1 ] ( b ) , the solitons start to decay into vortices .",
    "the corresponding bec densities in coordinate space are shown in figs .",
    "[ wave ] ( b ) and ( c ) , with zoomed - in images presented in figs .",
    "[ phase ] ( a ) and ( c ) , respectively . to verify the vortex formation",
    ", we plot the phase of the wavefunction in figs .",
    "[ phase ] ( b ) and ( d ) .",
    "two of the vortices in each of figs",
    ".  [ phase ] ( b ) and ( d ) are highlighted by circles , where the phase changes from 0 to 2@xmath66 in one round trip .",
    "the arrow represents the direction of the vortex . since the vertical axis corresponds to the radial direction , and the system is azimuthally symmetric , the two highlighted vortices are part of a single annular vortex ring around @xmath67 .",
    "in this paper , we have simulated the dynamics of a bec in a combined potential consisting of a magnetic trap and an optical lattice . after a sufficiently large initial displacement from the center of the harmonic trap",
    ", the bec undergoes an oscillatory motion similar to a bloch oscillation .",
    "we find that the mean field plays an interesting role during these oscillations .",
    "while a moderate amount of mean field suppresses the momentum dispersion of the bec , at large values it causes solitons and vortices to appear .",
    "we have also investigated the dependence of vortex formation on the initial displacement @xmath29 .",
    "some of the results presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : dispersion ] have already been verified in a series of bloch - oscillation experiments  @xcite .",
    "quantitative studies of the mean - field - induced dispersion characteristics of bloch oscillations in harmonic traps may be performed by time - of - flight measurements of the momentum distribution vs atom number . it will be challenging to experimentally probe the formation of annular vortices in 2d cartesian projections of the bec obtained using standard time - of - flight shadow imaging .",
    "however , it may be possible to obtain indirect evidence , such as complex structure in momentum distributions ."
