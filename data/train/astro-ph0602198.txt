    "luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) have huge infrared luminosities ( l@xmath9 ) , corresponding to an extremely active phase of dust enshrouded star formation and/or agn activity .",
    "they are under - luminous at rest - frame uv wavelengths because they are reprocessing and radiating much of their energy in the infrared ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "lirgs become an increasingly significant population at high redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ) and are likely to dominate the luminosity density at @xmath10 , representing an important phase in the build - up of massive galaxy bulges and in the growth of their central super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) . to understand these processes , it is essential to separate the contribution of agn and starbursts to the ir luminosity of lirgs .    recent work has shown how the _ irac _ color - color diagram and _ mips _ 24 @xmath1 to 8 @xmath1 color can be used to identify agn - dominated lirgs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate how the 24 @xmath1 to 8 @xmath1 flux ratio ( @xmath11 $ ] ) can be used to disentangle the contribution of agn and starbursts to the total reprocessed mid - ir ( @xmath12 ) emission as a function of 24 @xmath1 flux .",
    "the utility of the mid - ir slope as an agn / starburst diagnostic was first demonstrated on samples of nearby _ iras _ galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and further developed by @xcite .",
    "the powerful uv and x - ray emission from an agn can heat the surrounding dust to a range of temperatures up the sublimation temperature of @xmath131500 k , resulting in a shallow mid - ir power - law continuum ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , hot stellar sources in star - forming galaxies do not typically heat dust to these temperatures , resulting in a steeper mid - ir continuum slope . if the observed 24 @xmath1 and 8 @xmath1 flux densities are not heavily influenced by absorption and emission features , agn - dominated lirgs should have smaller values of @xmath14 than starburst - dominated lirgs .",
    "cooler dust temperatures which are characterized by steeper mid - ir continua may also be expected in sources containing only a weak or heavily obscured agn .",
    "we will return to these issues in section  [ sec : dis ] . in this work ,",
    "we use the mid - ir slope as an agn / starburst diagnostic applied to a large statistical sample of sources observed with the _ spitzer space telescope_.",
    "the sample for this study was drawn from _ spitzer _ observations of the noao deep wide - field survey botes field ( ndwfs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the 9.93 deg@xmath15 region has been mapped by _",
    "spitzer / mips _ at 24 @xmath1 ( f@xmath4 ; comprising 28,391 sources down to a 5@xmath16 depth of @xmath130.3 mjy ; version made on july 8th 2005 ) .",
    "an 8.5 deg@xmath15 region of the field has been mapped in all four _ spitzer / irac _ bands by the _ irac",
    "_ shallow survey ( @xcite ) , reaching 5@xmath16 depths at 8 @xmath1 of @xmath130.076 mjy ( for the fluxes measured in 6@xmath17 apertures ) .",
    "the 24 @xmath1 catalog was created by running a psf fitting technique using daophot . in this paper , only the 25,681 24 @xmath1 sources whose positions overlapped with data in both the ndwfs and _ irac _ shallow survey are considered ( @xmath13 8.2 deg@xmath15 ) .",
    "optical and infrared identifications were determined by matching the 24 @xmath1 catalog to the multi - wavelength catalogs using a 2@xmath17 matching radius .",
    "we used the 8 @xmath1 flux densities ( f@xmath18 ) measured in 6@xmath17 apertures corrected to the total flux density assuming a point source profile . in cases with no 8 @xmath1 catalog detection ( 1588 sources ) , f@xmath18 was measured directly from the images ; when no signal was found ( 557 sources ) , the f@xmath18 limit ( defined as 3 times the locally measured sky rms ) , was used . in practice , the inclusion or exclusion of these sources does not significantly affect any of our conclusions",
    ".    the botes region has also been surveyed by the 5-ks _ chandra x - ray observatory _ ( xbotes ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the agn and galaxy evolution survey ( ages ; kochanek et al .  in prep . ;",
    "@xcite ) has also targeted the botes field , providing spectroscopic redshifts for 98% of the f@xmath19 mjy 24 @xmath1 sources with @xmath20 ( optical point sources ) and f@xmath21 mjy sources with @xmath22 ( optical extended sources ) .",
    "as described in section  3 , we use this survey to exclude @xmath230.6 sources in which strong pah emission may fall into the observed 8 @xmath1 bandpass .",
    "we calculated @xmath14 for each 24 @xmath1 source as a crude measure of the mid - ir continuum slope .",
    "this provides an estimate of the relative luminosities of the hot ( @xmath13 750 k at @xmath241 ) and warm ( @xmath13 250 k at @xmath241 ) dust components .",
    "histograms of @xmath14 for different f@xmath4 bins are plotted in figure  [ fig : f24_8]a .",
    "the distribution has 4 peaks , located at @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "as we discuss below , we identify these peaks with stars , low - redshift normal star - forming galaxies , agn , and higher redshift starburst galaxies respectively . in addition",
    ", sources have progressively lower values of @xmath14 at higher f@xmath4 .",
    "although the sources with no 8 @xmath1 detection become a larger fraction at smaller f@xmath4 , they should only affect the tail of the distributions at @xmath29 and will not significantly affect the location or width of either peak .",
    "strong pah emission and silicate absorption can bias the broad - band flux density measurements of lirgs . in low redshift ( @xmath30 ) galaxies , strong 7.7 @xmath1 pah emission can bias @xmath14 to smaller values , rendering normal star - forming galaxies and agn difficult to separate ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "to avoid this bias , we use existing spectroscopic redshifts from ages and conservatively exclude the 5642 sources with @xmath31 from our sample . although ages is @xmath1398% complete for optically bright sources , optically faint ( @xmath32 ) low - redshift ( @xmath31 ) galaxies may remain in our sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : f24_8]b shows that after exclusion of the ages @xmath31 sources , the @xmath25 and @xmath26 peaks become only a small residual and the distribution of the remaining 20,039 sources becomes largely bimodal . by fitting the @xmath14 peaks with gaussian profiles , we estimate the residual contamination by low - redshift galaxies in our @xmath0 sample to be only @xmath132% .",
    "x - ray data show that agn - dominated sources populate the @xmath33 peak . of the 20,039 24 @xmath1 sources considered in this work ,",
    "most of which are likely at @xmath0 , 1095 ( @xmath135% ) have an x - ray counterpart in the _ chandra _ xbotes survey ; their @xmath14 distribution is overplotted in figure  [ fig : f24_8 ] .",
    "these sources occupy a narrow distribution around @xmath33 , i.e. , a flat spectrum in @xmath2f@xmath3 consistent with the typical slope of unobscured agn ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "because the xbotes survey has a relatively shallow flux density limit ( f@xmath34 ; @xcite ) , all 24 @xmath1 sources at @xmath0 with an x - ray counterpart must contain a powerful ( @xmath35 ) agn .",
    "this does not mean that the mid - ir emission from 24 @xmath1 sources without x - ray counterparts can not be dominated by an agn .",
    "the x - ray emission from the agn could be significantly attenuated in lirgs , even in the hard x - ray band .",
    "in addition , the x - ray emission from agn has been shown to be highly variable with time ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "inclusion of the x - ray data serves purely to demonstrate that the @xmath14 distribution of 24 @xmath1 sources hosting a powerful agn peaks at @xmath360 .      of the 20,039 24 @xmath1 sources at @xmath0",
    ", we have optical spectra for 1702 optically bright sources from ages and 174 optically fainter sources from keck / deimos . for all optical spectra for which the signal - to - noise ratio was sufficient to perform the analysis",
    ", we classified the ages sources by eye into those with signs of agn activity ( i.e. , clear broad line emission lines or high ionization lines ) , only galaxy signatures , or both .",
    "figure  [ fig : f24_8_ages ] shows that the sources with agn signatures fall in a narrow distribution around @xmath360 where we expect agn - dominated sources .",
    "the @xmath14 distribution of sources with no agn signatures in their optical spectra peaks at @xmath360.5 .",
    "there is a smaller tail at higher @xmath14 values than for the general population .",
    "this is presumably because the ages sources are all optically bright and hence do not include the most dusty , obscured and/or high redshift starburst galaxies which tend to have the highest @xmath14 values .",
    "the sources with both agn and galaxy signatures have a large range of @xmath14 values , suggesting that they are powered by a combination of agn and starburst activity .",
    "figure  [ fig : f24f8_z ] shows @xmath14 as a function of redshift for all 174 @xmath0 sources for which we have spectroscopic redshifts from keck / deimos and for all 616 optically bright ages sources which have x - ray counterparts from the xbotes survey .",
    "overplotted are lirg and ulirg templates whose infrared emission is known to be dominated by either a starburst ( arp 220 , m82 , ngc 6090 ) or an agn ( ngc 1068 , mrk 231 ) . the templates show that we expect starburst - dominated lirgs to have significantly higher values of @xmath14 ( with @xmath37 than agn - dominated lirgs at all redshifts except @xmath38 .",
    "the pronounced dip in @xmath14 of starburst - dominated lirg templates is due to a strong 9.7 @xmath7 silicate absorption feature entering the observed frame 24 @xmath7 band .",
    "the possible effects of this are discussed in section  [ sec : dis ] .",
    "the x - ray sources span a large redshift range and have @xmath14 values that are , in almost all cases , consistent with the agn - dominated templates .",
    "the sources with high @xmath14 tend to have lower redshifts , perhaps suggesting that the majority of @xmath39 starburst - dominated lirgs are too faint to be included in our 24 @xmath7 sample ( see , e.g. , @xcite figure  5 . ) , have lower values of @xmath14 due to silicate absorption , or have only weak spectral features in the observed - frame optical band .      assuming that the mid - ir emission from all @xmath0 sources in the @xmath360 and @xmath360.5 peaks are respectively agn- and starburst - dominated , we can estimate the agn - dominated fraction as a function of f@xmath4 .",
    "the number of sources in each peak were estimated by fitting the positions , widths , and amplitudes of two gaussian profiles ( chosen for simplicity and because they fit the data reasonably well ) .",
    "the central position of the agn peak was determined first by fitting a gaussian profile to the @xmath14 histogram of the x - ray sources .",
    "the central position of the starburst peak was then determined by fitting 2 gaussian profiles to the @xmath14 histogram of the 0.3 mjy@xmath40f@xmath410.5 mjy sources while fixing the position and width of the agn peak to their estimated values .",
    "the widths and amplitudes of the two peaks were then simultaneously fit as a function of f@xmath4 , with their positions fixed .",
    "table  [ tab : hist_par ] lists the resulting fits . the fraction of sources whose mid - ir emission is dominated by an agn is estimated from the area under the @xmath33 gaussian divided by the total area .",

    "thus , in the deepest 24 @xmath1 surveys , starbursts will dominate the mid - ir emission in the vast majority of sources .",
    "we note that this is a measurement constrained by the assumption that the distributions of the agn and non - agn populations as a function of @xmath14 can be approximated by gaussian distributions .",
    "figure  [ fig : agnfrac]b shows the fraction of all 24 @xmath1 sources whose mid - ir emission is dominated by an agn as a function of their 24 @xmath1 flux .",
    "we assume that all @xmath43 sources are starburst - dominated unless they have x - ray counterparts in the xbotes survey , so this calculation should be treated as a lower limit . @xcite and @xcite present phenomenological models for the evolution of different populations to determine their contributions to the 24 @xmath7 source counts .",
    "although both models reproduce the observed trend of a higher fraction of agn - dominated lirgs at high f@xmath4 , the models of @xcite are in better agreement with our observations .",
    "our results agree well with the results of @xcite who identify agn - dominated sources by their hard x - ray emission for all 24 @xmath1 sources in the goods field ( see figure  [ fig : agnfrac]b ) .      to estimate the contribution of agn to the 24 @xmath1 background ,",
    "the @xmath31 sources were again included , and assumed to be starburst - dominated unless they were x - ray sources .",
    "these results were combined with the differential number counts from @xcite to estimate the contribution of agn to the 24 @xmath1 background .",
    "down to the f@xmath4=0.3 mjy limit of our sample , where we resolve @xmath8 30% of the 24 @xmath1 background , agn contribute @xmath1310% of the total mid - ir flux .",
    "this is consistent with the results of @xcite and @xcite . to estimate the contribution of agn to the total 24 @xmath1 background , our estimates of the fraction of sources dominated by agn",
    "were extrapolated to f@xmath4=0.033 mjy ( the flux density limit of the data used by @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite estimate that they resolve @xmath1370% of the background .",
    "we assume the remaining 30% of the background is comprised of f@xmath440.033 mjy starbursts .",
    "assuming that the fraction of agn - dominated sources tends to 0 and 0.1 at f@xmath4=0.033 mjy , we find that agn contribute 3 and 7% of the background respectively .",
    "the 24 @xmath1 background is dominated by sources with low 24 @xmath1 flux ( peaking at @xmath130.2 mjy ; @xcite ) .",
    "although agn do not dominate the mid - ir emission in these sources , they could still contribute to a significant fraction of the total emission , and therefore make up a larger fraction of the total 24 @xmath1 background than the above calculation suggests .",
    "in addition , the agn light could remain obscured in the observed 8 @xmath1 band but still dominate the emission at longer wavelengths .",
    "our result should therefore be considered a lower limit .",
    "there is a clear bimodal distribution in the @xmath14 values of @xmath0 24 @xmath1 sources at @xmath33 and @xmath45 . in addition , the sources with brighter f@xmath4 are increasingly likely to populate the @xmath33 peak .",
    "we suggest that this bimodal behavior may be due to the presence or absence of a powerful agn which heats the surrounding dust to high temperatures ( @xmath13 1500 k at the dust - sublimation radius ; e.g. , @xcite ) , resulting in a shallower power - law continuum slope for the agn - dominated sources .",
    "our confidence in this interpretation is boosted by the remarkably narrow @xmath14 distribution of the x - ray sources at @xmath33 .    making the crude assumption",
    "that , on average , the @xmath0 sources with higher f@xmath4 correspond to sources with higher ir luminosities , our results imply that the fraction of agn - dominated sources increases significantly with ir luminosity .",
    "this is in broad agreement with a number of earlier studies at low redshift .",
    "@xcite used _ iso _ to study a sample of brighter , nearby ulirgs .",
    "they measured the ratio of the 7.7 @xmath1 pah emission feature to the local continuum to determine that while only 15% of lirgs at luminosities below 2@xmath46 are agn powered , this number increases to @xmath850% at higher luminosities .",
    "although the @xmath14 diagnostic appears to work well in distinguishing agn and starburst dominated sources , we note several caveats with its use .",
    "many broad emission and absorption line features are known to be present in the mid - ir spectrum of lirgs ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) and this may affect @xmath14 as a function of redshift . we have already discussed how the 7.7 @xmath7 pah emission feature depresses @xmath14 when it passes through the 8 @xmath7 band in @xmath43 galaxies . at higher @xmath47 , the most notable broad feature which may affect @xmath14 is the silicate absorption feature at 9.7@xmath1 .",
    "if present , this may strongly attenuate the observed 24 @xmath1 emission at z@xmath131.1 - 1.7 , resulting in a lower @xmath14 and hence mimicking a shallower continuum slope ( see figure  [ fig : f24f8_z ] ) .",
    "dusty starburst - dominated lirgs at z@xmath131.1 - 1.7 may therefore be mis - classified as agn ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this should not significantly affect our agn - fraction determination since , if the absorption feature is strong enough , only a small number of affected sources will be bright enough to be selected in our shallow 24 @xmath1 survey . @xcite",
    "predict @xmath1325 non - agn sources per square degree with @xmath480.25 mjy at @xmath241.1 - 1.7 .",
    "we therefore expect a maximum of only @xmath13225 starburst - dominated sources ( @xmath131% of our @xmath0 sample ) to be mis - classified as agn - dominated sources due to the silicate absorption feature .",
    "it is also possible that an agn could be heavily embedded in large amounts of cooler dust and could remain undetected in the 8 @xmath1 band even though it dominates the bolometric infrared emission . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show that nearby seyfert 2 galaxies tend to have steeper mid - ir spectra than nearby seyfert 1 galaxies , suggesting that high absorption blocks a large fraction of the mid - ir emission from the inner torus , at least in low luminosity agn in the local universe . in the x - ray detected agn",
    ", we notice a weak trend of lower @xmath14 values in the sources with fainter optical counterparts , suggesting that obscuration may influence our results .",
    "ideally , one would estimate the continuum slope at longer wavelengths to avoid this problem .",
    "nevertheless , although these potential effects may be important , they do not significantly dilute the bimodal nature of the @xmath14 distribution and therefore can not be the dominant effect .    obtaining complete samples of optically fainter mid - ir sources with spectroscopic redshifts",
    "will be important in testing the @xmath14 diagnostic and in drawing conclusions about the physical nature of high redshift lirgs .",
    "in particular , this will allow us to confirm whether the fraction of agn - dominated sources increases with ir luminosity at high redshift , and to determine the effects of measuring the dust continuum slope at different rest - frame wavelengths ( can powerful agn really be so embedded that their near - ir emission is absorbed ? ) .",
    "redshift information will also be crucial in determining the contribution of lirgs to the star - formation and smbh accretion histories in massive galaxies and in investigating whether the agn- and starburst - dominated lirgs and ulirgs form an evolutionary sequence .",
