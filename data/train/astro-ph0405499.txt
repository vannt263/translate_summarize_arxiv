    "in the past few years , many deep @xmath4 images of the extragalactic sky have been obtained , with the 2 ms @xmath4 deep field north ( cdf - n , e.g. , alexander et all .",
    "2003 ) and 1ms @xmath4 deep field south ( cdf - s , giacconi et al . 2002 ; rosati et al .",
    "2002 ) being the two deepest . combining such exposures with deep optical images allows easy selection of candidate high redshift ( i.e. , @xmath0 , hereafter high - z ) agns .",
    "such high - z agns are extremely faint in optical bands blueward of the ly@xmath9 wavelength , because of the heavy absorption of uv light by the high redshift igm ( e.g. , fan et al .",
    "optically undetected x - ray sources are thus good candidates for high - redshift agns .",
    "their space density provides an upper limit on the density of high - z agns , and can help determine their cosmological evolution and contribution to reionization ( e.g. , see alexander et al .",
    "2001 ; barger et al . 2003a",
    "; koekemoer et al . 2004 ; wang et al . 2004 ) .",
    "however , the absence of these candidates in optical bands makes them difficult to identify spectroscopically .",
    "this motivates different approaches to studying them .",
    "currently , the efforts mainly focus on their infrared colors ( e.g. , yan et al .",
    "2003 ; koekemoer et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in this letter",
    ", we point out for the first time that the x - ray hardness ratio can be used to filter out low - z sources from these x - ray selected , optically undetected high - z candidates .",
    "high - z agns can not be hard in @xmath4 images , because the absorption that makes the x - ray spectra harder is redshifted out of the soft x - ray band in the observed frame .",
    "in section 2 , we present detailed simulations to quantify this effect . here the hardness ratio ( hr ) is defined as ( h - s)/(h+s ) , where s and h are the soft ( 0.5  2.0 kev ) and hard ( 2.0  8.0 kev)hr @xmath8 0.008 from our simulations ) .",
    "this is actually expected because @xmath4 has much lower effective area above 7 kev and 7.0  8.0 kev x - ray net count makes a very small contribution to the whole hard band . ]",
    "x - ray band net counts detected by @xmath4 .",
    "the x - ray spectra of low and intermediate redshift agns have been well studied using the observations from several generations of x - ray satellites , including einstein , rosat , asca , bepposax , @xmath4 , and xmm . for type 1 agns ( i.e. , seyfert 1 galaxies , and qsos ) ,",
    "the basic component of their x - ray spectra is a power law with photon index @xmath10 ( e.g. , nandra et al .",
    "1997 ; george et al .",
    "2000 , malizia et al . 2003 ) and an exponential cut off at high energies ( @xmath1 200 kev , see malizia et al .",
    "2003 ) . for type",
    "2 agns ( i.e. , seyfert 2 galaxies , and type 2 qsos ) , the power law is cut off at low energies by photo - electric absorption , and the cutoff energy increases with the column density of the intercepted torus ( e.g. , turner et al .",
    "1997a ; norman et al . 2002 ) .",
    "recent @xmath4 observations show that the x - ray spectra of qsos ( i.e. , luminous agns ) at @xmath11 = 4.0  6.3 are also well fitted by a power law with photon index @xmath12 = 1.9 ( vignali et al .",
    "this indicates that although the space density of agns varies significantly from @xmath13 0  6 , the shape of their intrinsic x - ray spectra evolves relatively little .",
    "evidence for warm absorbers and/or soft excess emission ( e.g. , krolik & kriss 2001 ; piro , matt & ricci 1997 ) have also been found in significant numbers of agns .",
    "however , at high - z , these features shift out of @xmath4 s soft band .    in this section we present simulations to predict the x - ray colors in @xmath4 images for high - z agns by assuming a power law spectrum ( @xmath12 = 1.9 ) with different absorption column densities ( n@xmath14 = 10@xmath15 , 10@xmath16 , 10@xmath17 , 10@xmath18 @xmath19 respectively",
    "; see fig . 1 for the model spectra ) .",
    "we used xspec 11.0.1to do the simulations , and model @xmath20 in xspec , a photoelectric absorption using wisconsin cross - sections ( morrison and mccammon , 1983 ) , to simulate the neutral absorption in the rest frame .",
    "the @xmath4 acis on - axis instrument response for cdf - s ( giacconi et al .",
    "2002 ) was used , and the galactic hi column density ( n@xmath14 = 0.8 @xmath21 ) in cdf - s was taken account during the simulations on - axis instrument response calculated for other acis - i fields , does not affect any results presented in this paper . ] .",
    "the output x - ray hardness ratios are plotted in fig .",
    "we can see that the predicted hr is a constant ( -0.58 for @xmath12 = 1.9 ) for agns without intrinsic absorption at any redshift , because of the power law shape of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the corresponding hr for different photon indices are also shown in fig .",
    "[ hr ] . while the photon index for qsos varies from 1.5 to 3.0 ( e.g. , george et al . 2000 ) , the dominant source of variation in hardness ratio hr is absorption .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ hr ] that an extreme power - law with @xmath22 would still give a soft color ( hr = -0.41 ) . for agns with intrinsic absorption ,",
    "the predicted hardness ratio varies with redshift : at lower redshift , the x - ray spectra are much harder because the soft x - ray emission are significantly attenuated by the absorber ; but at @xmath0 , we barely see differences between the x - ray hardness ratios of x - ray spectra with absorption up to n@xmath14 = 10@xmath17 @xmath19 , because the absorption has largely redshifted out of the soft x - ray band . if the absorber is compton thick ( n@xmath23 ) , even the hard x - ray emission would be significantly attenuated . at @xmath0 ,",
    "the predicted hardness ratio is @xmath1 0.0 . in the compton thick regime ( n@xmath14 = @xmath24 ) , further correction to photoelectric absorption is needed , due to compton scattering ( see matt , pompilio & la franca 1999 ; yaqoob 1997 ) .",
    "based on figure 3 of matt et al .",
    "( 1999 ) which includes compton scattering , we conclude that the _ shape _ of the transmitted curve is unchanged by compton scattering , while the amplitude decreases by a factor of 1.7 .    for higher column density ( n@xmath25 ) , the direct x - ray emission is strongly attenuated , and the x - ray spectra are dominated by a reflection component from cold and neutral gas ( e.g. , turner et al . 1997b ) .",
    "we used the xspec model @xmath26 ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) to simulate such pure reflection spectra . at 0.45 , which is closest in overall shape to the reflected spectrum averaged over all viewing angles .",
    "reflection from smaller viewing angles tends to be slightly harder ( @xmath27 ) , but obviously , this is not the case for type ii agns which are supposed to edge - on . ]",
    "the fe k emission line at 6.4 kev has a higher equivalent width ( ew ) in the reflection dominated x - ray spectra of agns ( e.g. , ghisellini , haardt & matt 1994 ; levenson et al .",
    "2002 ) since the direct component is absent",
    ". therefore we add an fe k emission line at 6.4 kev with ew of 1 kev in the rest frame , which is normal in the reflection dominated x - ray spectra of agns ( e.g. , levenson et al .",
    "the x - ray spectra of agns at low to intermediate redshifts can be extremely hard due to heavy absorption ( with hardness ratios up to hr @xmath1 1.0 ) .",
    "however , they are much softer at higher redshift because the absorbed energy shifts out of the observed bands ( see fig . 2 for simulations , and fig",
    ". 12 of szokoly et al .",
    "2004 for the hr distribution of a large sample of agns from @xmath11 = 0 - 4 ) .",
    "agns at @xmath28 with intrinsic absorption up to n@xmath29 should have hr @xmath1 - 0.5 , and the compton - thick ones ( n@xmath30 ) should have hr @xmath31 0.1 . due to heavy absorption , and compton scattering , the x - ray flux of compton - thick agns ( n@xmath32 @xmath33 )",
    "is attenuated by a factor of 9.5 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    for pure reflection spectra ,",
    "the attenuation is even larger : assuming a reflection efficiency of 3% in rest frame 2.0  10.0 kev band ( e.g. , see norman et al . 2002 ) yields a factor of 21 .",
    "thus any high redshift sources detected with a large hardness ratio would have intrinsic x - ray luminosity of @xmath34 erg s@xmath35 . we know",
    "that brighter qsos are much rarer ; according to the x - ray luminosity function of agns ( e.g. , see miyaji , hasinger , & schmidt 2001 ; ueda et al .",
    "2003 ) , a tenfold increase in luminosity implies a hundredfold drop in the space density . furthermore , there is evidence that the fraction of type 2 agns decreases at higher intrinsic luminosity ( e.g. , steffen et al .",
    "2003 ; ueda et al .",
    "we conclude that those candidates with @xmath36 are statistically unlikely to be at @xmath28 .",
    "they are either obscured agns or qsos at low to intermediate redshift .",
    "@xmath4 has detected a number of agns at high redshift . presently , there are 66 agns at @xmath37 detected by @xmath4 acis , and 41 of them have published soft ( 0.5  2.0 kev ) and hard ( 2.0  8.0 kev ) band net counts ( or 0.5  2.0 kev band and 0.5  8.0 kev band net counts ) ( alexander et al . 2003 ; barger et al .",

    "all of the 41 sources have hr @xmath38 0.0 , with an average value of -0.60@xmath39 , in excellent agreement with our estimates above .",
    "all of these sources are type 1 agns , and most of them are optically selected .",
    "since strong x - ray emission is expected from both type 1 and type 2 agns , we expect the x - ray selected high - z agn sample to include both types . however we argue that the hardness ratio distribution of the x - ray selected high - z agns should be similar to that of the known @xmath40 agns based on following reasons : i ) the 3 x - ray selected agns with @xmath37 have consistent soft x - ray colors with the rest ; ii ) high - z type 2 agns with n@xmath14 upto 10@xmath41 are also expected to be x - ray soft with hr @xmath1 -0.5 ; iii ) type 2 agns with heavier absorption are much fainter in observed x - ray fluxes , thus are much rarer .",
    "wang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) presented 168 x - ray sources detected by an 172 ks @xmath4 acis exposure in the large area lyman alpha ( lala , e.g , rhoads et al . 2003 ) botes field .",

    "the sources and their hardness ratios are listed in table 1 of wang et al . in fig .",
    "3 , we plot their hardness ratios comparing with the 41 @xmath4 detected @xmath37 agns .",
    "the two distributions are distinguishable at 99.99% level according to the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test . down to a flux limit of 1.7 @xmath43 10@xmath44 ergs @xmath19 s@xmath35 ,",
    "the 19 sources contribute @xmath1 8% to the total 2  10 kev band x - ray background ( wang et al .",
    "2004 ) . after removing sources with hr @xmath45 0",
    ", we lose 50% of the candidates and the contribution to the total x - ray background drops to @xmath1 4% .",
    "yan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) studied the infrared colors of 6 @xmath46 band nondetected x - ray sources in cdf - s .",
    "these sources are listed in table 1 .",
    "two of them have hr @xmath7 0.0 , and can not be at @xmath0 .",
    "this agrees with yan s statement , that all these sources are unlikely to be at @xmath0 based on their infrared colors .",
    "koekemoer et al .",
    "( 2004 ) presented 7 x - ray sources in cdf - s which are undetected in deep multi - band goods hst acs images , with extremely high x - ray - to - optical ratios and red colors ( @xmath47  k ) .",
    "these sources might be located at @xmath6 6 such that even their ly@xmath9 emission is redshifted out of the bandpass of acs @xmath47 filter .",
    "we find that 3 of the 7 sources have hr @xmath7 0.0 , indicating that their x - ray colors are too hard to be at @xmath48 .",
    "these 3 sources could instead be type 2 agns at low to intermediate redshift .",
    "their nuclear optical emission should be heavily obscured , and their host galaxies need to be substantially underluminous , or dust - obscured , compared to other known sources ( koekemoer et al .",
    "this confirms that there is a population of agns at low to intermediate redshift which are extremely red , with high x - ray - to - optical ratios , and undetected at the depth of goods .",
    "the analogous sample among non - active galaxies is the population of extremely red objects ( eros ) , which have surface density comparable to lyman break galaxies but a much lower typical redshift ( e.g. , vaisanen & johansson 2004 ) .    using deep multicolor optical data , barger et al .",
    "( 2003a ) searched candidate @xmath0 agns in the 2 ms x - ray exposure of the cdf - n , and found that besides the one x - ray source spectroscopically confirmed at @xmath49 , only 31 x - ray sources with @xmath50 25.2 and no b or v band detection could lie at @xmath0 .",
    "barger et al . ( 2003b ) provided multiband photometry for the cdf - n x - ray sources , which allows us to identify the 31 candidate high - z agns band undetected ) , and tune the threshold magnitudes to match the numbers of sources discussed in barger et al . 2003a .",
    "thus the sample we picked up could statistically represent that of barger et al .",

    "15 of the 31 sources have hardness ratios hr @xmath45 0.0 , and thus can not have @xmath0 .",
    "this directly supports the deduction that the majority of the optically undetected x - ray sources are extreme examples of the optically faint x - ray source population , most of which are obscured agns at z @xmath38 3 ( alexander et al . 2001 ) .",
    "barger et al . ( 2003a ) pointed out that haiman & loeb ( 1999 ) overestimated the surface density of @xmath0 agns by at least an order of magnitude , and similar conclusions can be seen in alexander et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and szokoly et al .",
    "our analyses indicate that applying the x - ray hardness ratio cutoff ( hr @xmath45 0.0 ) could further reduce the surface density of candidate @xmath0 agns , and strengthen the above conclusions by a factor of 2 .",
    "this also supports the statement that agns made little contribution to the reionization at @xmath51 ( barger et al .",
    "2003a ; also see dijkstra , haiman & loeb 2004 ; moustakas & immler 2004 ) .",
    "in this letter we present detailed simulations showing that high - z agns can not be hard in @xmath4 images since x - ray absorption will shift out of soft band at high redshift .",
    "high redshift agns should appear soft in x - rays , with hardness ratio hr @xmath1 -0.5 at @xmath28 , even if there is strong absorption with @xmath2 up to @xmath3 .",
    "high - z agns that are compton thick ( @xmath52 ) could have hr @xmath1 0.0 . however , these should be rare in deep chandra images , since they have to be @xmath7 10 times brighter intrinsically , which implies @xmath7 100 times drop in their space density .",
    "most optically undetected x - ray sources with hr @xmath7 0.0 should be obscured agns at low to intermediate redshift .",
    "applying the hardness criterion ( hr @xmath8 0.0 ) can filter out about 50% of the candidate high redshift agns selected from deep chandra images .",
    "this criterion can thereby help us to understand the nature of these @xmath4 x - ray sources , put additional robust constraints to the space density of high - z agns , and significantly reduce the expensive telescope time needed to spectroscopically confirm high - z agn samples based on deep @xmath4 images .",
