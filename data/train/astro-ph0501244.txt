    "most low - mass main  sequence stars are members of binary or multiple systems ( duquennoy & mayor 1991 , fischer & marcy 1992 ) . the binary frequency of pre - main - sequence stars is also high , and probably higher than for main - sequence stars ( mathieu , walter & myers 1989 ; simon et al .",
    "1992 ; ghez , neugebauer & matthews 1993 ; leinert 1993 ; reipurth & zinnecker 1993 ) . in the last decade , interest in these systems has increased significantly with the discovery that many t - tauri and other pre - main - sequence binary stars , possess both circumstellar and circumbinary disks ( for a review see mathieu 1994 ) .",
    "observations of binary systems suggest the existence of disk material around one or both stars , as is inferred from observations of excess radiation at infrared to millimeter wavelengths , polarization , and both balmer and forbidden emission lines ( mathieu 2000 ) .",
    "some extrasolar planets have been found to orbit stars that have a stellar companion , e.g. , 16 cygni b , @xmath1 bootis , and 55 @xmath2 cancri ( butler et al .",
    "1997 ; cochran et al .",
    "1997 ) , confirming that planets can form in binary star systems .",
    "thus the study of stellar disks in binary systems , as well as the possibility of stable orbits , is a key element for better understanding stellar and planetary formation .",
    "it is currently believed that multiple stellar systems result from fragmentation , which produces mainly eccentric binaries ( bonnell & bastien 1992 , bate 1997 ; bate & bonnell 1997 ) , in particular wide stellar systems with separations @xmath3 10 @xmath4 ( bate , bonnell & bromm 2002 ) .",
    "although main - sequence binary systems typically have eccentric orbits ( duquennoy & mayor 1991 ) , most theoretical studies have focused on binaries in near - circular orbits .",
    "extensive and very good theoretical work has been done here ( lubow & shu 1975 ; paczyski 1977 ; rudak & paczyski 1981 ; papaloizou & pringle 1977 ; bonnell & bastien 1992 , bate 1997 ; bate & bonnell 1997 ) .",
    "only a few observed pre - main sequence binaries have known orbital elements ( pogodin et al .",
    "2004 ; schaefer et al . 2003 ; masciadri & raga 2002 ) and information on the accompanying disks is even rarer ( kastner 2004 ; jensen et al .",
    "2004 ; nielbock 2003 ; liu 2003 ; rodriguez et al .",
    "1998 , and references therein ) . from the observational point of view , measuring the size of a circumstellar disk is quite difficult , since these are typically @xmath5 across .",
    "modelers also have a hard task , since dynamical effects like resonances can introduce very fine and complicated structure . in circular binaries , where the gravitational potential is fixed in a uniformly - rotating frame , and an energy - like integral is conserved along particle orbits , the position and strength of resonances can be calculated . in the interesting eccentric case , we lack a conserved integral , and it is not clear how to proceed .",
    "one of the most important studies to date is by artymowicz & lubow ( 1994 ) , who compute analytically the position of orbital resonances ( between 1:4 and 1:3 ) in the circumstellar disks , and approximate the sizes of disks by computing the radius where resonant and viscous torques balance each other .",
    "their results , however , depend strongly on the badly - constrained viscosity parameter .    the complexity of the problem has prompted some researchers to use direct @xmath6-body simulations to study the possible existence of stable orbits for planets around eccentric orbits ( david et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) .",
    "this approach , however , is computationally expensive when accuracy is required .",
    "others have used hydrodynamic simulations ( foulkes et al .",
    "2004 ; guerrero , garca - berro , isern 2004 ; lanzafame 2003 and references therein ) .",
    "unfortunately these simulations depend sensitively on the unknown viscosity as well , and are quite expensive computationally .    in this work",
    "we have opted for a simpler approach , analogous to using the structure of periodic orbits in a circular binary , to predict the gas flow .",
    "the path followed by a gas parcel in a stable disk around a star must not intersect itself , or the path of a neighboring parcel ( in the case of planets , the paths may cross and we consider this in the application to a planetary system ) . using a test particle method , we probe the orbital structure of binaries of various eccentricities and mass ratios , and identify families of _ stable invariant loops_. these consist of closed contours in configuration space , such that as each point initially in them evolves forward in time in the binary potential , the contour changes its shape but comes back to its original form and position when the potential has completed a period ( maciejewski & sparke 1997 , 2000 ) . when invariant loops do not cross , they may be filled with gas ;",
    "if the gas loses or gains angular momentum it may drift through a sequence of invariant loops .",
    "although further restrictions may limit the regions occupied by gas in an eccentric binary , our study offers a firm first survey of the regions where gaseous disks and planets can not exist around stars in eccentric binary systems .",
    "in section [ whatisloop ] we review the concept of an _ invariant loop _ , and describe our orbit integration method and the strategy used to find invariant loops .",
    "the application to the circular binary as a test case is presented in section [ ecc0 ] . the application to the general case of arbitrary orbital eccentricity is shown in section [ eccgeneral ] . in section [ observations ]",
    "we apply this study to observations of l1551  irs5 and @xmath0 centauri .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "a time - periodic potential in the ( two dimensional ) orbital plane of an eccentric binary , is mathematically equivalent to a 3-d system with an autonomous hamiltonian , but with the addition of time ( in our case , the binary phase ) and the hamiltonian as two extra dimensions in phase space ( e.g. lichtenberg & lieberman 1992 , section 1.2 ) .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to orbits that lie within the orbital plane of the binary , the extended phase space will have 6 dimensions and regular orbits will lie on a 3-dimensional hypersurface .",
    "the motion of a regular orbit is then multiply periodic ( arnold , 1984 ) with three frequencies , one of which is the oscillation frequency of the potential .",
    "if we examine the system at fixed orbital phases , we slice through the extended phase space at a fixed position on the time axis , and the resulting projection of a regular orbit will lie on a 2-dimensional hypersurface , densely filling an area on the orbital plane .",
    "an additional integral of motion would confine an orbit to lie on a 1-dimensional curve .",
    "every time the system comes back to the initial orbital phase , the particle that follows this orbit will land on the same 1-dimensional curve : an _ invariant loop_. if we were to `` paint '' in a series of different colors all particles that initially lie on such a curve , we would see each follow its own path as the binary stars move around each other , distorting the initial shape ; but as the binary returns to the initial orbital phase , the painted curve would come back to the same initial locus , and although each particle would be at a different point along the curve , the original order of the colors would be conserved .",
    "stable invariant loops represent the generalization to periodically time - varying potentials of the stable closed orbits that form the ` backbone ' of the orbital structure in time - independent potentials .",
    "particle orbits that start near a stable invariant loop will remain trapped close to it , exploring a nearby region in phase space .",
    "gas in a low - viscosity regime trying to settle down in a quasi - static configuration will converge on the non - intersecting stable invariant loops .",
    "we write the equations of motion for the binary star system in term of the eccentric anomaly @xmath7 ( e.g. goldstein 2002 , section 3.7 ) .",
    "we use units where the gravitational constant @xmath8 , the binary semi - major axis @xmath9 , and its total mass @xmath10 are set to unity so that , the binary period is @xmath11 , and its frequency @xmath12 .",
    "the separation of the two stars at time @xmath13 , measured from periastron where the azimuthal angle @xmath14 , is given by the radius @xmath15 ,    @xmath16    the binary eccentricity , defined as @xmath17 where @xmath9 , and @xmath18 are the semimajor and semiminor axes , and the mass ratio @xmath19 are the only free parameters .",
    "we used an adams integrator ( from the nag fortran library ) to follow the motion of a test particle moving in the orbital plane of the two stars .",
    "kepler s equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is solved within a tolerance of @xmath20 . in the circular case ,",
    "the jacobi energy of the test particle ( computed as a diagnostic for the quality of the numerical integration ) is conserved within one part in @xmath21 per binary period .",
    "the equations of motion of the test particle are solved in an inertial reference frame using cartesian coordinates , with their origin at the center of mass of the binary .",
    "all test particle trajectories are launched when the binary is at periastron , with the two components lying on the @xmath22-axis .",
    "we search initially for families of loops that are symmetric about this line , so we launch test particles at various points along the @xmath22-axis and perpendicular to it .",
    "we then store the particle s position and velocity every time the stars return to periastron .",
    "the computation is halted if the particle runs away , moving further than 10 times the semimajor axis ( @xmath9 ) from the center of mass , or if it comes within a distance of either star that results in a high number of force computations , generally due to close approaches to the stars . in this manner , we obtain orbits around each star ( circumstellar ) , orbits around both stars ( circumbinary ) , runaway orbits , and orbits that are captured by one of the stars .      among all the possible orbits , we are seeking a very special type : the _ invariant loops _ , for which the successive phase - space coordinates of our test particle fall on a one - dimensional curve . to find them , we examine the iterates in some two - dimensional subspace , such as the @xmath23 plane .",
    "we plot the positions of the test particle at each complete binary period , and compute their dispersion along the radial direction for those that lie within a sector that spans a small angle ( @xmath24 ) about the x axis . repeating the integration with the same starting @xmath22-value , we adjust the launch velocity @xmath25 to minimize this dispersion . in each panel of figure [ fig.seekloop ] , we show iterates from three particles that orbit around the primary star , and three around the secondary .",
    "as @xmath25 is adjusted , the iterates converge towards the loops in panel d.    effectively , our method finds only stable loops .",
    "particles launched near an unstable loop would rapidly diverge from it , and we would not see the convergence illustrated in figure [ fig.seekloop ] . very near the stars , the stable loops are close to stable circular orbits in the potential of that star alone .",
    "we exploit this fact to find families of circumstellar loops : we start by launching a particle close to either star , with a speed appropriate to the circular orbit .",
    "once we have found a loop , we move the starting point in small steps away from the star , and use the loops we have just found to predict the next starting speed .",
    "the process ends when we can find no more loops with larger starting distances . to map out a family of circumbinary loops , we begin at large radii , where the loops are close to circular orbits about the center of mass ; we continue inwards until no more loops are found .",
    "-axis . in panels a ) to d ) , the launch speeds approach those for stable loops , and the dispersion of the iterates decreases until the loop is found.,width=317 ]",
    "in the limit that the binary s eccentricity goes to zero , the invariant loops should be exactly the closed circumstellar and circumbinary orbits ( periodic orbits ) for the circular system .",
    "we computed several orbits for cases with different mass ratios , to compare with other theoretical work .",
    "we took arbitrary points of several computed loops as initial conditions to calculate the orbit in the non - inertial reference frame , corotating with the line that joins the stars .",
    "the resultant orbits indeed close on themselves , showing that for the circular binary , invariant loops are none other than the familiar periodic orbits .    in figure [ fig.periodic ] we show",

    "we show an example of the intersecting loops that start mostly when the disks loops approach to the roche lobe . these kind of loops ,",
    "although stable , can not be populated by gas particles due to the intersection with the inner disk loops which would induce shocks dissipating first the less attached gas particles settle down in the intersecting loops . the dotted circles ( aimed with straight arrows ) represent a good fit to the radius of the roche lobe as calculated by the analytic approximation by eggleton ( 1983 ) . for star @xmath26 , the roche radius @xmath27 is given by    @xmath28    note that the circumstellar periodic orbits are not circular , but are elongated perpendicular to the line joining the stars .",
    "orbits very close to the roche lobe change their shape dramatically crossing in some cases this frontier ( e.g. circumprimary disk with @xmath29 ) and producing intersections with the inner orbits . in an eccentric binary ,",
    "the circumstellar disks tend to be also elongated in the same sense . in high eccentricity cases ( @xmath30 ) , disks are nearly circular .        using our method to search for invariant loops ,",
    "we have computed the limiting radii of circumstellar and circumbinary disks for mass ratios @xmath31 ranging from the jupiter - sun system ( @xmath32 ) to the equal - mass case @xmath33 .",
    "the limiting radii are selected as the loops overlap or when no more loops are found ( the more common case when @xmath34 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig.radiuse0 ] , we present the disk sizes at periastron as a function of the mass fraction . for our limiting loops , we measured the disk extent in both directions along the @xmath22-axis joining the two stars .",
    "the nearly - vertical continuous lines marked at the top with l1 , l2 , l3 are the lagrange points .",
    "the circumstellar disks are confined within the lagrange points , while the circumbinary disk is approximately centered on the origin , the mass center of the binary .",
    "the filled squares are the limiting radii found by rudak & paczyski ( 1981 ) , who approximate the gas streamlines in pressureless accretion disks by non - intersecting simple periodic orbits .",

    "unlike the zero eccentricity case , where particles see a simple time - steady potential , we now have a variation of the potential in time ; in this manner particles will see a changing situation in any rotating reference frame .",
    "the phase space increases its dimensionality including now time as a canonical variable .    in the same manner as for the circular case , we have constructed figures showing disk sizes for eccentricities up to @xmath38 , for a given mass ratio @xmath31 . in figure [ fig.q0.1 ]",

    "for all mass ratios and @xmath41 , the size of the disk around the secondary star is well predicted as @xmath42 of the lagrange radius times @xmath40 .",

    "shows that for a mass ratio @xmath29 , or @xmath52 , the circumsecondary disk should be roughly 60% smaller than the circumprimary disk .",
    "since we see two nearly equal disks , this implies @xmath53 for this system .",
    "if we assume that is a circular orbit , the circumstellar disks could both extend to 13.5 @xmath4 if the stellar masses are equal , or 9.5 and 15.3 @xmath4 for circumsecondary and circumprimary disks respectively , if @xmath29 . the circumbinary disk gap would then end about 90 @xmath4 from the center of mass of the system .",
    "the measured disks are only approximately 10 @xmath4 in radius , which might be probably due simply to the fact that the emission weakens , make it difficult to detect , however we have also explored the possibility that the reduced size of the disks is due to the fact that the binary orbit is slightly eccentric , in this manner we have constructed a range of possibilities for this system . for @xmath54 ,",
    "table [ tab.l1551 ] shows that the disks should be truncated short of their observed extent of 10  @xmath4 ; so we conclude that the eccentricity of the system is in the interval @xmath55 $ ] . the extreme case with @xmath29 , and @xmath56 , would produce very different disk sizes ( @xmath57 ) , so we discard this possibility also .",
    "thus the system parameters are constrained approximately by @xmath58 .      as one of the alternatives to form planets in accretion disks arised the `` planetesimal theory '' :",
    "planets are formed in circumstellar dust disks , where colliding dust grains accrete into planetesimals approximately of 1 - 10 km of diameter ( safronov 1969 ; lissauer 1993 ) .",
    "as the sizes of particles increase and gravitational attraction becomes more important , the cross - section for accretion also increases , as more and more particles collide .",
    "this effect , combined with dynamical friction , leads to `` runaway growth '' : large bodies accrete more efficiently than small bodies , becoming planetary embryos that increase their masses through collisions until most of the material is accreted or dispersed by these new protoplanets ( greenberg et al . 1978 ; wetherhill & stuart 1989 ) .",

    "<S> we explore test particle orbits in the orbital plane of eccentric stellar binary systems , searching for `` invariant loops '' : closed curves that change shape periodically as a function of binary orbital phase as the test particles in them move under the stars gravity . </S>",
    "<S> stable invariant loops play the same role in this periodically - varying potential as stable periodic orbits do in stationary potentials ; in particular , when dissipation is weak , gas will most likely follow the non - intersecting loops , while nearby particle orbits librate around them . </S>",
    "<S> we use this method to set bounds on the sizes of disks around the stars , and on the gap between those and the inner edge of a possible circumbinary disk . </S>",
    "<S> gas dynamics may impose further restrictions , but our study sets upper bounds for the size of circumstellar disks , and a lower bound for the inner radius of a circumbinary disk . </S>",
    "<S> we find that circumstellar disks are sharply reduced as the binary s eccentricity grows . </S>",
    "<S> for the disk around the secondary star , the tidal ( jacobi ) radius calculated for circular orbits at the periastron radius , gives a good estimate of the maximum size . </S>",
    "<S> disks change in size and shape only marginally with the binary phase , with no strong preference to increase or decrease at any particular phase . </S>",
    "<S> the circumstellar disks in particular can be quite asymmetric . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results with other numerical and theoretical results and with observations of the @xmath0 centauri and l1551 systems , finding very good agreement . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated changes in the shapes and crowding of the circumstellar orbits can be used to predict how the disk luminosity and mass inflow should vary with binary phase .    </S>",
