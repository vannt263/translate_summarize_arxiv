    "in recent years , advances in quantum control have emerged through the introduction of appropriate and powerful tools coming from mathematical control theory @xcite and by the use of sophisticated experimental techniques to shape the corresponding control fields @xcite .",
    "all these efforts have lead nowadays to an unexpected and satisfactory agreement between theory and experiment . on the theoretical side ,",
    "one major tool to design the control field is optimal control theory ( oct ) @xcite . over the past few years",
    ", numerical iterative methods have been developed in quantum control to solve the optimization problems .",
    "basically , they can be divided into two families , the gradient ascent algorithms @xcite and the krotov @xcite or the monotonic @xcite ones .",
    "the design of optimal control fields by standard iterative algorithms @xcite can require the computation of several hundreds numerical propagations of the dynamical quantum system .",
    "while the efficiency of this procedure has been established for low dimensional quantum systems , this approach can numerically be prohibitive for large dimensions . in this latter case",
    ", it is possible to use more easily accessible numerical methods , such as the local control approach @xcite . roughly speaking",
    ", the optimization procedure is built from a lyapunov function @xmath0 over the state space , which is minimum ( or maximum ) for the target state .",
    "a control field that ensures the monotonic decrease ( or increase ) of @xmath0 is constructed with the help of the first derivative @xmath1 of @xmath0 .",
    "note that this approach has largely been explored in quantum control @xcite .",
    "thanks to the progresses in numerical optimization techniques , it is now possible to design high quality control along with some experimental imperfections and constraints .",
    "recent studies have shown how to extend the standard optimization procedures in order to take into account some experimental requirements such as the spectral constraints @xcite , the non - linear interaction between the system and the laser field @xcite , the robustness against experimental errors @xcite . in view of experimental applications in quantum control , it is also desirable to design pulse sequences with a zero global time - integrated area .",
    "several works have pointed out the inherent experimental difficulties associated with the use of non - zero area fields @xcite , in particular for laser fields in the thz regime .",
    "since the dc component of the field is not a solution of maxwell s equation , such pulses are distorted when they propagate in free space as well as through focusing optics .",
    "the standard optimization procedures do not take into account this basic requirement , designing thus non - physical control fields . in this framework ,",
    "a question which naturally arises is whether one can adapt the known optimization algorithms to this additional constraint .",
    "this paper aims at taking a step toward the answer of this open question by proposing new formulations of optimal and local control algorithms .",
    "the zero - area requirement for the laser fields is mathematically fulfilled by the introduction of a lagrange multiplier and the derivation of the corresponding optimal equations .",
    "the goal of this paper is to explore the efficiency of the generalized optimal and local control algorithms on two key control problems of molecular dynamics : orientation and photodissociation .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the new formulations of optimization control algorithms are presented in sec .",

    "other cost functionals could of course be chosen .",
    "more specifically , a monotonic optimal control algorithm can be formulated to satisfy the zero - area constraint .",
    "for such a purpose let us consider the following cost functional @xmath14-\\mu \\left[\\int_0^{t_f}{e(t)dt}\\right]^2-\\lambda \\int_0^{t_f } { [ e(t)-e_{ref}(t)]^2/s(t)dt}\\ , , \\label{eq : newjoc}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is a reference pulse and @xmath16 an envelope shape given by @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath16 ensures that the field is smoothly switched on and off at the beginning and at the end of the control .",
    "the positive parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 , expressed in a.u . , weight the different parts of @xmath20 , which penalize the area of the field ( @xmath18- term ) and its energy ( @xmath19- term ) . in this algorithm , we determine the field @xmath21 at step @xmath22 from the field @xmath23 at step @xmath24 , such that the variation @xmath25 . at step @xmath24 , the reference field @xmath15 is taken as @xmath26 and we denote by @xmath27 its time - integrated area .",

    "the adiabatic - to - diabatic transformation matrix @xmath113 has been derived by integrating @xmath114 from the asymptotic region where both representations coincide .",
    "the local control of a nonadiabatic dissociation requires a careful choice of the operator @xmath43 referred to in eq .",

    "figure [ fig : heh_area](a ) shows the dramatic evolution of the pulse profile for two values of @xmath18 ( 0.05 and 0.10 ) .",
    "the main change is the suppression of the erratic positive structure which can be interpreted as a stark field .",

    "[ fig : heh_area](b ) .",

    "the measures @xmath122 evaluated with the filtered fields ( fig .  [ fig : heh_area](f ) ) are smaller than the unfiltered ones by about two orders of magnitude , while the objectives are reduced by about a factor 1.5 , as seen by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : heh_area](e ) and fig .",

    "the procedure is built from the introduction of a lagrange multiplier aiming at penalizing the area of the field .",
    "the value of the corresponding parameter is chosen to express the relative weight between the area and the other terms of the cost functional , i.e. the projection onto the target state and the energy of the electric field .",
    "the efficiency of the algorithms is exemplified on two key control problems of molecular dynamics : namely , the molecular orientation of co and the photodissociation of heh@xmath2 .    from a theoretical view point , the zero - area constraint is crucial since all electromagnetic fields which are physically realistic must fulfill this requirement .",
