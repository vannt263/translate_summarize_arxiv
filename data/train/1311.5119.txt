    "two - dimensional gauge systems including generally covariant theories and those with higher rank fields strike a balance between descriptive simplicity and nontrivial content .",
    "basically , this can be explained by that in two dimensions , unlike in higher dimensions , only scalar or spinor modes can propagate .",
    "it follows that some of gauge systems are topological while others may exhibit a quite complicated dynamical structure which encodes matter modes .",
    "both cases are intrinsically related because the matter can interact via topological gauge fields , while matter modes themselves can be represented as particular components of gauge fields .",
    "this is most clearly illustrated by the massive schwinger model of fermions interacting via topological maxwell field , or by the liouville field originating as the metric component in the conformal gauge .",
    "a prominent example of topological gauge systems is the jackiw - teitelboim gravity model @xcite which replaces the standard gravitation theory .",
    "recall that in two dimensions einstein tensor vanishes identically so that the simplest alternative is given by diffeomorphism invariant equation of motion of the form is a general two - dimensional space - time with local coordinates @xmath3 , lorentz world indices run @xmath4 , lorentz fiber indices run @xmath5 , @xmath6 fiber indices run @xmath7 , @xmath6 invariant metric is @xmath8 .",

    "adding an auxiliary scalar field @xmath19 allows one to introduce the variational principle so that the resulting local action describes a particular dilaton gravity .",
    "the theory is however topological and contains no local degrees of freedom . at the same time , @xmath2 spacetime and black hole type objects are solutions of the jackiw - teitelboim model @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to elaborate a higher spin generalization of pure gravity system governed by equation .",
    "we introduce higher rank gauge fields and their equations of motion in such a way that the resulting gauge system contains the gravitational subsector . as a guiding principle",
    ", we employ the frame - like formulation instead of the metric - like one used to postulate equation .",
    "the idea behind the frame - like approach originates from the cartan formulation of the einstein gravity where the metric is the symmetric component of the vielbein , while the antisymmetric component is a pure gauge by local lorentz transformations .    indeed , when extending to higher spins , the jackiw - teitelboim model viewed as a gauge theory of the @xmath2 global symmetry algebra @xmath20 with a bf local action @xcite has conceptual advantages over alternative approaches .",
    "one considers bf action with fields taking values in @xmath1 algebra with a finite parameter @xmath21 .",
    "we show that such a theory can be interpreted as two - dimensional topological @xmath2 higher spin gravity theory .",
    "note that conventional higher - spin metric - like fields @xmath22 with @xmath23 lorentz indices appear as particular tensor components of @xmath1 gauge connection rewritten in @xmath24 manifestly lorentz covariant basis .",
    "other components are either auxiliary or pure gauges .",
    "we find that the set of local fields over @xmath2 background consists of gauge fields with spins @xmath25 and masses @xmath26 interpreted as topological partially - massless fields of maximal depth .- form fields of the bf formulation will be analyzed elsewhere @xcite . ]    on going from the original bf formulation linearized over @xmath2 space to the metric - like formulation one finds out that there are two different but dynamically equivalent forms of the metric - like theory .",
    "in particular , it turns out that the gauge sector of the quadratic theory can be dually represented either by massive scalar equations or by conservation conditions for higher spin currents .",
    "both scalar / current equations are invariant with respect to on - shell symmetries / improvements that guarantee the absence of local degrees of freedom .    while the bf theories under consideration are topological , we have in mind to study @xmath2 models with local degrees of freedom interacting via higher spin topological fields .",
    "such an interacting theory will contain at least cubic field - current interactions of the form @xmath27 , where @xmath28 are some lorentz spin-@xmath23 gauge fields , while @xmath29 are conserved lorentz spin-@xmath23 currents built of matter fields .",
    "higher spin model has been proposed by vasiliev @xcite .",
    "remarkably , it is formulated as bf theory with fields taking values in some infinite - dimensional algebra , and up to now this is the only example of fully non - linear higher spin gauge theory with local degrees of freedom formulated at the action level .",
