    "most low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) contain rapidly spinning neutron stars ( nss ) , which only in a few cases become apparent as millisecond x - ray pulsars . this growing sub - class of accreting millisecond pulsars ( amps ; see @xcite for a review ) consists of dim transients that typically go in outburst during a few weeks once every few years ( so far the only exception is hete  j1900.1 - 2455 , still active at the moment of writing , more than a year after its discovery ) .",
    "amps are thought to be the evolutionary link between neutron star lmxbs and millisecond radio pulsars , according to the so - called recycling scenario ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "eight years after the first of the amps was discovered ( sax  j1808.43658 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) it is still unknown why these systems show pulsations and the rest of neutron star lmxbs do not , although some explanations have been put forward ( e.g. screening of the magnetic field , @xcite ; smearing of the pulsations , @xcite ) .",
    "aperiodic variability in the x - ray lightcurves of black hole and neutron star lmxbs ( bh / ns - lmxbs ) , such as broadband noise or quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) , offers a powerful tool to study the accretion flow in its inner region , where the bulk of the radiation is thought to originate and where gravitational fields are extreme @xcite . using this tool ns - lmxbs",
    "were classified according to their correlated timing and energy spectral behavior into z and atoll sources @xcite . as noted several years ago ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , very similar physical mechanisms are expected to drive the accretion process in bh- and ns - lmxbs , and the difficulties in finding unequivocal signatures of a black hole or a neutron star in the energy or power spectral properties of lmxbs are a natural consequence of this fact .",
    "several attempts to find direct bh signatures have been made based on the spectral properties at high energies ( @xcite ; but see also @xcite or @xcite ) or in the power spectral properties at high frequencies ( @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , apart from pulsations and type i x - ray bursts , twin variable - frequency kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( twin khz qpos ) are now considered a ns signature @xcite .",
    "ns - lmxbs are also known to be fainter than bh - lmxbs at radio wavelengths @xcite , and bh - lmxbs are generally fainter in x - rays when they are in quiescence @xcite .",
    "we present in this work the results of the aperiodic timing and x - ray color analysis of one of the seven known amps , igr  j00291 + 5934 .",
    "we show the exceptional behavior of this source in its 2004 outburst , more similar with respect to aperiodic x - ray variability to a bh - lmxb than to the presently known ns - lmxbs : igr  j00291 + 5934 was variable at very low frequencies with a very high fractional amplitude .",
    "however , previously identified ns signatures were also present in the highest frequencies . in section  [ sec : review ] we briefly review some information on this source and in sections  [ sec : data ] and [ sec : results ] we describe our analysis and give its results , respectively .",
    "section  [ sec : discussion ] contains our final remarks and conclusions .",
    "on december @xmath1 , 2004 , igr j00291 + 5934 was discovered with _",
    "integral _ during one of the galactic plane scans @xcite .",
    "follow up observations with _",
    "rxte _ revealed coherent pulsations at 598.88 hz @xcite , making it the fastest spinning amp known .",
    "the pulse frequency exhibited a sinusoidal modulation with a period of 147.4 minutes ( @xmath02.45 hr ) indicative of the orbital motion of the pulsar in the binary system @xcite .",
    "optical @xcite , radio @xcite and infrared @xcite counterparts were identified and a recurrence time of @xmath03 yr was suggested by @xcite , based on _ rxte _ s all - sky monitor data .",
    "positive spin frequency derivatives were reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "several estimates of the distance to the source have been made , ranging from @xmath03 to @xmath010 kpc @xcite .",
    "we used all the pointed pca observations of the 2004 outburst of igr  j00291 + 5934 , performed by _ rxte _ between december 3d . and 20th ( see table  [ table : obs ] ) .",
    "an intermediate polar was also inside the pca s field of view : v709 cas ( which has a spin period of @xmath0313 seconds ; @xcite ) .",
    "hereinafter we refer to this system as the ip .",
    "all necessary caveats were taken in both color and timing analysis in order to avoid contamination from this foreground source , as explained below .",
    "after filtering out unsuitable data according to the recommended criteria we extracted count rates from standard 2 data , with 16 s time resolution , in the following bands ( in kev ) : a : 2.03.5 , b : 3.56.0 , c : 6.09.7 , d : 9.716.0 , and we computed soft ( b / a ) and hard ( d / c ) colors and intensity ( a+b+c+d ) .",
    "the instrumental background was subtracted according to the standard faint - source background models and the colors and intensity normalized to the crab values nearest in time @xcite and in the same pca gain epoch ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "using webpimms and the spectrum reported by @xcite , and taking into account the @xmath00.3 deg .",
    "offset between the ip and our source , we estimate a foreground 2 - 16 kev count rate from the ip of @xmath03.6 c / s / pcu ( to be compared with the peak rate in our observations of @xmath076 c / s / pcu ) , which matches approximately the observed intensity during our last dataset ( @xmath05 c / s in pcu2 ) , when igr  j00291 + 5934 had presumably ceased activity ( see section  [ sec : results ] , figure  [ fig : lc ] ) .",
    "the effect of this contaminating flux is probably strongest on the colors , which are sensitive to subtle changes in the energy spectrum .",
    "for that reason we consider only the color - color diagram of the first half of the outburst , where the flux from the ip is less than 20% of the background subtracted total ( see section  [ ssec : color ] ) .    goodxenon and event modes were used for the timing analysis ( see table  [ table : obs ] ) , rebinned in both cases to a 1/8192-s time resolution ( nyquist frequency of 4096  hz ) and including only the counts in the @xmath02.5 - 30 kev range ( absolute channels 5 - 71 ; this choice optimizes the s / n ) .",
    "we performed fast fourier transforms in 1024-s data segments , reaching thereby fourier frequencies down to @xmath00.001  hz .",
    "two observations were shorter than 1024 s ( 90425 - 01 - 01 - 01 and 90425 - 01 - 01 - 03 ) so we performed and analyzed a 512-s fft in each of them .",
    "no background subtraction or dead - time correction were made prior to the ffts and the poisson noise power was subtracted from the resulting power density spectra , following @xcite : we first estimated the poisson noise using the expression proposed by @xcite and then ( after inspecting the @xmath024  khz range and finding no unexpected features ) shifted it to match the level between 20004096  hz , where no intrinsic power is expected to be present , but only counting statistics noise ( this shift was in all cases smaller than 0.06% of the previously estimated poisson level ) .",
    "we then normalized the power spectra in the so - called rms normalization @xcite . for this normalization purpose , in order to take into account the foreground flux contributed by the ip , we used the count rates in the tail of the outburst ( when the amp reaches its quiescent state ; set c ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ) to estimate the average background and foreground rate during the data segments used for timing . in order to improve the statistics we averaged observations successive in time and with power spectra consistent within errors , thereby dividing the outburst data into four sets ( table  [ table : obs ] , fig  [ fig : lc ] ) .",
    "the integrated power was calculated between 0.01 and 100 hz in order to avoid contamination from the ip s variability ( see section  [ ssec : timing ] ) .",
    "we fitted the power spectra with a fit function composed of a sum of lorentzians in the `` @xmath2 representation '' is the lorentzian s centroid frequency and @xmath3 its hwhm ( half width at half maximum ) , @xmath4 gives the characteristic frequency of the feature ( near the centroid if it is narrow and near the half - width if it is wide ) .",
    "the quality factor @xmath5 is used in this representation as a measure of the coherence of the variability feature .",
    "its strength is given by the integral power ( 0@xmath6 ) whose square root , in the normalization we use , is the fractional rms amplitude of the variability . ] , excluding the first four frequency bins to preclude the ip s variability .",
    "in some cases , in order to avoid a meaningless negative coherence , @xmath7 was fixed to zero , which is equivalent to fitting a zero - centered lorentzian . from now on , following previous work @xcite we refer to these components as @xmath8 , where the l stands for lorentzian and @xmath9 is the label identifying the component ( such identification is given in sections  [ ssec : timing ] and [ ssec : nsbh ] ) . following this notation we call @xmath8 s characteristic frequency @xmath10 and its coherence @xmath11 .",
    "five to seven lorentzians were necessary to fit the power spectra , as described in detail in the next section .",
    "the time evolution of the count rate and colors can be seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : lc ] .",
    "the lightcurve shows two clearly different slopes in a semi - logaritmic plot , indicating two different exponential decay timescales . as noted in previous works ( e.g. *",
    "* ) , this is common behavior among amps , with xte  j1807294 the only known exception @xcite .",
    "we fitted the first two parts of the ( 2.016.0 kev ) lightcurve ( a1+a2 and b ) and found e - folding times of @xmath12 and @xmath13 days , similar to the ones reported in @xcite from the _ integral _ 20100 kev lightcurve .",
    "overall the source spectrum was hard compared to that of other amps @xcite and it softened at both high ( 6.016.0 kev ) and low ( 2.06.0 kev ) energies during the first @xmath09 days decay ( see time evolution of soft and hard color in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ) . the resulting track in the color - color diagram in this first half of the outburst",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : ccd ] .",
    "after the first 9 days ( sets b and c in our analysis ) , the ip contributes with a significant fraction of the flux ( @xmath1420% if all the flux in c comes from the ip ) and the increase of the colors is likely due to that ( intermediate polars are thought to be the hardest x - ray emitting cataclysmic variables ; see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      the power spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ps1 ] ) on first inspection show an overall shape characteristic of low ( luminosity ) and hard ( spectra ) states of atoll sources , usually called island and extreme island states ( where spectral hardness and total rms increase and luminosity and variability frequencies decrease when going from the island to the extreme island state ) .",
    "however , the overall ( 0.01 - 100 hz ) fractional rms amplitude is in the @xmath042 - 58 % range ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rmsqpo ] , table  [ table : psfits ] ) , much higher than any value reported to date for a ns - lmxb ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "five to six lorentzian components were used to fit these power spectra .",
    "the best fit parameters are displayed in table  [ table : psfits ] .",
    "the fit functions comprise i ) one broad lorentzian at 0.03 - 0.05  hz accounting for the flat - top noise and its break ( @xmath15 for `` break '' ; see sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] for nomenclature ) ii ) two qpos between 0.02 and 0.05  hz ( @xmath16 and its subharmonic , @xmath17 ) and iii ) three zero - centered lorentzians with characteristic frequencies covering the 0.5 - 0.8 hz , 3 - 5.5 hz and 25 - 70 hz ranges ( possibly @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively ; see section  [ ssec : nsbh ] for further discussion ) .",
    "all components are significant at a @xmath21 level except @xmath16 and @xmath17 in dataset b.    the flat - top noise present in these observations can be alternatively described with a sum of two broad lorentzians , one of them giving the first break and the other describing a further steepening above that break ( a `` wing '' above the break in frequency@xmath22power representation ; see figure  [ fig : psalt ] ) . for completeness",
    "we report the parameters of those fits in table  [ table : psfits2 ] .",
    "these fits are better from a statistical point of view ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 improvement in set a1 , a2 and b , respectively , according to the f - test ) and give a more detailed description of the structure around the break , but are more difficult to compare with other sources ( where usually single - lorentzian or broken power - law breaks are measured ) .",
    "therefore , we use the frequencies of the first described six - lorentzians fit function when comparing with frequencies of other sources ( see section  [ sec : discussion ] ) .    assuming the ip did not drastically vary its behavior synchronously to the amp s outburst phases",
    ", we can reject the possibility that an appreciable part of the variability above 0.01  hz comes from the ip .",
    "this is shown qualitatively by the lack of power above @xmath00.01  hz in the power spectrum of the last dataset ( figure  [ fig : ps2 ] ) , when the amp is back to quiescence .",
    "quantitatively , if e.g. , @xmath16 came from the ip it had an rms amplitude of @xmath027% of the ip s flux in set a1 , and fell below the detection level in set c. a similar quantitative argument can be made for all variability components , as the integrated power between 0.01 and 100  hz in set c was zero within errors .",
    "we split the energy range into four contiguous bands ( channels 5 - 9 , 10 - 15 , 16 - 25 , 26 - 71 : 2.54 kev , 4.56.5 kev , 6.910.6 kev and 11.030.0 kev , respectively ) and found no significant variations with energy in the strength , width or frequency of the detected qpos or noise components . on the other hand a clear time evolution of both the qpos and the broad - band noise is detected as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rmsqpo ] : the ( 0.01 - 100  hz ) fractional rms variability increased during the outburst ( from 41.7 to 57.8% ) , while the frequencies of the qpos and the other components decreased ( from @xmath00.79 to @xmath00.50  hz for @xmath26 ) .",
    "our analysis of the fastest spinning amp , igr  j00291 + 5934 , reveals the exceptional behavior of this source in its 2004 outburst compared to the rest of ns - lmxbs : very strong x - ray variability at very low fourier frequencies .",
    "its power spectra showed flat - topped noise ( i.e. approximately flat below a certain `` break '' frequency and decreasing above that ) with extremely low break frequencies ( @xmath00.04  hz ) , as well as very high integrated fractional rms variability ( @xmath050  % ) .",
    "these break frequencies are about two orders of magnitude lower than those observed in z sources and about one order of magnitude lower than those previously found in extreme island ( low - hard ) states of atoll sources ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the measured fractional rms amplitude of the variability is the highest found so far for in a ns - lmxb .",
    "both the break frequencies and fractional variability observed in igr  j00291 + 5934 are instead similar to those detected in low - hard states of bh - lmxbs ( though the frequencies are low even for the lowest bh - lmxb range ; see next section for a more detailed comparison ) .",
    "it has been noted @xcite that amps hardly `` make it to the soft state '' and instead remain in ( low - hard ) island or extreme island states .",
    "the ( 2.525.0  kev ) peak luminosity of igr  j00291 + 5934 ( between 0.5 and 5.5  % of the eddington luminosity according to the flux measured by @xcite and the different distance estimates , see sec .",
    "[ sec : review ] ) was similar to that of other transient ns - lmxbs when they show `` canonical '' extreme island states , which seems to indicate that the exceptional state of our source was not purely a consequence of an exceptionally low accretion rate .",
    "the lack of high frequency variability ( @xmath14100  hz ) during the outburst of igr  j00291 + 5934 might be related to a combination of a dynamically important magnetic field ( needed in amps in order to produce the observed pulsations ) and a fast spin ( spin frequency of @xmath0600 hz in the case of igr  j00291 + 5934 ) that could prevent the accretion disk from reaching the innermost regions , where the highest dynamical frequencies are present .",
    "this could in turn be related to the strong overall variability that we measured .",
    "if , as has been argued ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the disk sets the variability frequencies and the comptonizing medium ( corona , boundary layer , spreading layer , adaf or similar ) sets the variability amplitude , then a disk truncated at a large radius could provide both low dynamical frequencies and strong _ fractional _ variability , as its flux contribution would be relatively low and hence so would be the decrease that this flux would cause in the relative amplitude of the variability .",
    "we note , however , that in standard descriptions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the inner disk radius does not depend on the spin rate , and if the so - called propeller mechanism is responsible for clearing out the inner disk annulus this would be in contradiction with the reported spin - up @xcite , as the expelled matter would remove angular momentum from the neutron star .",
    "the interaction between a rapidly spinning magnetized neutron star and an accretion disk is a complex problem .",
    "most of the work so far concerns the `` classical '' slow x - ray pulsars @xcite and only recently the amp case has received more attention @xcite .",
    "an anticorrelation in the flat - topped noise of cyg  x-1 was discovered by @xcite linking the rms level of the flat top with the break frequency : the lower the break frequency , the higher is the flat - top ( in rms normalization ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : bhwk ] ( top ) we see how igr  j00291 + 5934 extends this relation to the lowest frequencies and the highest rms levels , even when comparing with the bh system cyg  x-1 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an update of this correlation and comparison with other neutron star systems , which are all at frequencies @xmath270.1  hz , and the bh - lmxb xte  j1118 + 480 , which is contiguous with but still at slightly higher frequecies than our ns - lmxb igr  j00291 + 5934 ) .",
    "the similarities between igr  j00291 + 5934 and bh - lmxbs in low - hard states are illustrated in figure  [ fig : comp ] , where a power spectrum of igr  j00291 + 5934 is compared to one of xte  j1118 + 480 and one of xte  j1550 - 564 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) .",
    "the flat - top noise has very similar power , break frequency and qpos .",
    "there are also obvious yet interesting differences : as previously noted in a study of low states of bh / ns - lmxbs the ns power spectra show more power at high frequencies ( @xmath1410  hz ) than the bh ones @xcite . in this extreme case , however , the differences between the power spectra of igr  j00291 + 5934 and xte  j1118 + 480 start at @xmath00.2 hz , where the ns power spectrum rises and the bh one starts to fall ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : comp ] ) .",
    "the power spectrum of xte  j1550 - 564 has a very similar shape to that of igr  j00291 + 5934 and xte  j1118 + 480 , but shifted towards higher frequency and lower rms .",
    "it also shows a prominent bump at @xmath01 - 10  hz ( similar to what is seen in igr  j00291 + 5934 at slightly lower frequency ) followed by a steep decline above @xmath010  hz ( characteristic of bh systems ; see @xcite for an extensive study and further discussion ) .",
    "in contrast to the ones studied in @xcite this ns - lmxb shows no significant power above @xmath0100  hz .",
    "we found two low - frequency qpos at @xmath00.02 and @xmath00.04  hz , similar to the ones seen in bh- and other ns - lmxbs in low - luminosity states @xcite .",
    "their centroid frequency ratios were 2.06@xmath280.06 and 1.91@xmath280.06 in a1 and a2 respectively , indicating an harmonic relation .",
    "in general this kind of qpo is associated with low - luminosity states and therefore it requires a relatively low mass accretion rate in the inner regions of the disk .",
    "several attemps have been made to investigate the nature of these low - frequency qpos , e.g. in the context of shot - noise models @xcite or thermal - viscous instabilities @xcite . in any case",
    "our work shows clearly that neither the presence of a solid surface nor a magnetic field affects this phenomenon so that the same physical mechanism must be at work in ns and bh systems in order to produce this common feature : harmonically related qpos superposed on a break in the flat - top noise at very low frequencies .",
    "@xcite found a correlation between the break frequency and the frequency of the `` hump '' present in the power spectra of atoll , z sources , black hole candidates and amps ( @xmath18 or sometimes an associated qpo , @xmath29 ) .",
    "we find that the frequency of the first zero - centered lorentzian detected above the break in the power spectra of igr  j00291 + 5934 also satisfies this wk correlation ( figure  [ fig : bhwk ] , bottom ) which leads us to identify it as @xmath18 .",
    "the fact that @xmath30 and @xmath31 fall much below this relation ( on top of the break as discussed ) suggests that they are not directly related to the low frequency qpos ( @xmath29 , @xmath32 ) measured sometimes on top of the `` hump '' . interestingly , the same happens for xte  j1118 + 480 and xte  j1550 - 564 : the qpos on top of the break fall clearly below the wk correlation , whereas @xmath18 follows it .",
    "the relations between the characteristic frequencies of several variability components of z and atoll sources and the frequency of the upper kilohertz qpo , @xmath33 , were studied and synthesized by @xcite ( figure  [ fig : vstraaten ] ) .",
    "shifts in these frequency - frequency correlations were found in two amps by @xcite and ( * ? ? ? * in sax  j1808.43658 and xte  j1807294 , respectively ) , in a way that was best explained by the upper and lower khz qpos having frequencies ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) lower than the ones measured in atoll sources by a factor @xmath01.5 .",
    "the component @xmath35 plotted in figure  [ fig : vstraaten ] is the broad component present below @xmath20 ( the component with the highest characteristic frequency ) in extreme island states of low - luminosity atoll sources ( including bursters and amps ; @xcite ) .",
    "we tentatively identify the two highest frequency variability components in igr  j00291 + 5934 as @xmath20 and @xmath35 , as these are the only broad variable - frequency components detected in extreme island states of ns - lmxbs above @xmath18 , and plot the frequencies of @xmath15 , @xmath18 and @xmath35 against that of @xmath20 ( figure  [ fig : vstraaten]a ) .",
    "as can clearly be seen in figure  [ fig : vstraaten ] , the frequencies of igr  j00291 + 5934 also vary in correlation to one another , but with slopes much less steep than those found in atoll sources and amps at higher frequencies . in order to compare igr  j00291 + 5934 with the two shifted amps ,",
    "we multiply @xmath33 and @xmath36 by a trial factor of 1.5 ( figure  [ fig : vstraaten]b ) .",
    "the tracks traced by igr  j00291 + 5934 seem to connect better with the ones at higher frequencies in the shifted version of the frequency - frequency plots , but of course the difference in slopes remains . we conclude that a radical change in the slope of these correlations appears to occur at frequencies @xmath37100  hz .",
    "it is unclear at this point to what extent this is universal to lmxbs or specific to igr  j00291 + 5934",
    ". it will be interesting to study the behavior of our source in future outbursts to see if at @xmath38  100hz its components follow the usual correlations or not .",
    "this work also sheds some light on another interesting issue regarding broad - band noise in power spectra .",
    "break frequencies are often used to estimate masses of accreting black holes with the argument that timescales in the accretion disk scale linearly with the mass of the central object and therefore the observed frequencies should scale inversely ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from the theoretical point of view",
    "this argument is weakened by our poor knowledge of what produces the broad - band noise and which timescale sets its break frequency ( viscous , dynamical , related with the size of the disk , with shot lifetime ; see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "from the observational point of view the application of this argument using break frequencies ( @xmath39 ) of the flat - top noise ( @xmath15 ) observed in low - hard states of lmxbs is clearly challenged by igr  j00291 + 5934 , as it harbors a neutron star and shows break frequencies lower than the ones observed in most of the more massive stellar - mass black holes .",
    "although @xmath39 of cyg  x-1 in the low - hard state was used in the past to infer masses of super - massive black holes , recent advances in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) x - ray timing indicate that most agn are in a state similar to the high - soft state of bh - lmxbs @xcite .",
    "any power spectral feature that is used in such mass - scaling arguments should i ) have a rather stable frequency ( like perhaps the hectohertz lorentzian in ns systems , @xcite ; see also @xcite ) or ii ) be accurately corrected for drifts due to some parameter varying in and between systems ( e.g. mass accretion rate ; @xcite ) or a combination of i ) and ii ) . in any case the power spectra observed in igr  j00291 + 5934 refute a simple mass - frequency relation for most of the variability components present in lmxbs .",

    "<S> flat - top noise and two harmonically related quasi - periodic oscillations , all of them at very low frequencies ( 0.01 - 0.1  hz ) , were present in the power spectra during most of the outburst as well as a very high fractional variability ( @xmath050  % ) . </S>",
    "<S> these properties are atypical not only for amps but also for neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) in general . </S>",
    "<S> there are instead some remarkable similarities with the variability observed in black hole systems , reinforcing the connections between these two types of lmxb , as well as some interesting differences . </S>",
    "<S> we note finally that the results of this paper are difficult to reconcile with interpretations where any break frequency of power density spectra scales inversely with the mass of the central object at an accuracy sufficient to distinguish between the masses of neutron stars and black holes in lmxbs .    </S>",
