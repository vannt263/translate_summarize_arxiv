    "one of the cornerstones of statistical physics is the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( * fdt * ) @xcite , whereby , for equilibrium systems , response to a small perturbation of the hamiltonian is related to dynamical correlation .",
    "this theorem rationalizes the famous regression principle of onsager @xcite : the decay of spontaneous fluctuation can not be distinguished from the decay of forced fluctuation .",
    "more precisely , suppose we perturb a system in equilibrium at temperature @xmath0 by adding to its time - independent hamiltonian @xmath1 a small time - dependent term , such that @xmath2 . here , @xmath3 is an observable and @xmath4 is a real function . throughout this paper ,",
    "we measure temperatures in units of the boltzmann constant @xmath5 .",
    "the * fdt * asserts that the response of an observable @xmath6 is related to the two - time correlation function as @xmath7 with @xmath8 . in this relation , the brackets ,",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 , denote expectation in the unperturbed and perturbed processes , respectively . since mid - nineties ,",
    "this theorem has been extended to nonequilibrium systems in two related directions .",
    "the first is the discovery of various fluctuation relations ( * fr * ) @xcite , the so - called * gallavotti - cohen relation * @xcite , the * jarzynski equality * @xcite and the * crooks theorem * @xcite .",
    "all of these hold arbitrarily far from equilibrium and can be viewed as non - perturbative extensions @xcite of the * fdt * ( [ ufdt ] ) .",
    "these relations constrain the distribution of entropy production or work performed in the system .",
    "the second is the extension of the relation ( [ ufdt ] ) between response and correlation in the linear response regime to nonequilibrium states ( stationary as well as non - stationary ) , for example , those in glassy systems and soft spin models @xcite and also in relation to broken supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "this second direction has seen an upsurge in the last three years through formulation of the generalized fluctuation - dissipation theorems ( * gfdt * ) , mainly in the works of seifert and speck in stuttgart @xcite , baiesi , maes and wynants in leuven @xcite , and gawedzki and chetrite in lyon and falkovich in rehovot @xcite ( see , also , the works @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , experimental verifications of the * gfdt * on colloidal particle have been done in lyon @xcite .    in the present paper , we revisit , generalize , and unify these * fr * and * gfdt * by couching them in the language of the kinematics of a general markov process , without strict mathematical rigor . we show that this language allows elementary proofs and generalizations of the different * * g**fdt which exist in the literature .",
    "we also consider a new family of non - perturbative extensions of the * * g**fdt which concerns a so - called * exponential forward martingale * functionals @xcite .",
    "finally , we revisit the * fr * and show their relation to forward and backward exponential martingales . in the process , we prove that a certain version of the crooks theorem and the jarzynski equality hold for fairly general markov processes , whereas the gallavotti - cohen relation for the performed work can be violated when the particle is subjected to a poisson or levy noise @xcite .",
    "general markov stochastic processes form an integral part of modeling of dynamics in statistical mechanics .",
    "although largely idealized , they often provide a sufficiently realistic description of experimental situations and have traditionally served as a playground for both theoretical considerations and numerical studies . in a continuous space",
    "( e.g. , @xmath11 ) , all continuous time markov processes consist of some combinations of diffusion , deterministic motion and random jumps .",
    "markov processes corresponding to equilibrium dynamics are characterized by the detailed balance property which ensures that the net probability flux between microstates of the system vanishes . on the other hand , with nonequilibrium markov dynamics ,",
    "detailed balance is violated and there are non - zero probability fluxes even in a stationary situation . for the purpose of characterizing the difference between equilibrium and nonequilibrium dynamics , it is interesting to find a vector field , a kind of velocity , which vanishes in equilibrium .",
    "such an object was introduced in the sixties by nelson in his seminal work @xcite with the notion of current velocity that we call here the * local symmetric velocity*. this quantity is an average of a well - chosen instantaneous velocity of the process conditioned to pass through a given point .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that nonequilibrium diffusive dynamics ( without the random jumps ) takes , in the lagrangian frame of this velocity , an equilibrium form with the detailed balance property and this explains the usual form ( [ ufdt ] ) of the * fdt * in that frame , which was observed previously in @xcite .",
    "the issue regarding the extension of this result to other types of markov processes is addressed in this article in one of the sections .",
    "the formulation of the usual * fdt * ( [ ufdt ] ) for some markov processes is known since long time @xcite in physics , but now it has a strictly mathematically rigorous formulation @xcite . for the * fr * , shortly after the earliest articles in the context of deterministic dynamics @xcite , the fluctuation relations were proved for some markovian dynamics . in @xcite , jarzynski generalized his relation to time - dependent pure jump markov processes . at around the same time",
    ", kurchan showed in @xcite that the stationary * fr * hold for the stochastic langevin - kramers evolution with additive noise .",
    "his result was extended to more general diffusion processes by lebowitz and spohn in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", maes has traced the origin of * fr * to the gibbsian nature of the statistics of the dynamical histories .",
    "finally , these relations were put into the language of stochastic thermodynamics by sekimoto @xcite and seifert @xcite . there",
    "exist now many reviews on fluctuation relations in the markovian context , like @xcite for pure jump process or @xcite for diffusion process , but the extension to * fr * for general markov process is still under debate @xcite .",
    "the paper consists of seven sections and six appendices .",
    "section 2 sets the stage and provides notations by briefly stating definitions relevant to markov processes .",
    "in particular , in section 2.1 , we recall the notions of transition probability , markov generator , stationary state and equilibrium state . in section 2.2 , we introduce the notion of cotransition probability , cogenerator , current and velocity operator .",
    "we also elucidate the relation between these objects .",
    "section 3 develops the kinematics of a markov process @xcite by defining a set of local derivatives and local velocities associated with such processes .",
    "it is proved in section 3.2 that these local derivatives appear naturally in the time derivative of correlation function which appears on the right hand side of the * fdt * ( [ ufdt ] ) .",
    "section 4 investigates the form of the kinematics elements , local velocities and velocity operator , for the three most common examples of markov process which appear in physics .",
    "first is the pure jump process in section 4.1 , which is a process with no diffusion and deterministic evolution .",
    "second is the diffusion process , considered in section 4.2 , which is a process that , on the contrary , neglects the random jumps . finally ,",
    "in section 4.3 , we investigate the less considered case which mixes diffusion , random jumps and deterministic motion given by a stochastic equation with gaussian and poissonian white noises .",
    "the latter noise consists of a sequence of @xmath12-function shaped pulses with random heights occurring at randomly distributed times .",
    "such a noise appears in the physical world , for example , it describes the emission of electrons in diodes or the counting process of photons . as examples , we study two physical realizations of such a dynamics involving colloidal particles trapped on the unit circle .",
    "it turns out that analytical computation of the stationary density is possible only for the first realization , and not for the second .",
    "hence , we resort to extensive numerical simulations to obtain the stationary density as well as the local velocity for the second realization .",
    "the first central section which contains novel results is section 5 which is devoted to the study of the behavior of a markovian system under a perturbation .",
    "more precisely , section 5.1 recalls the notion of response function to an arbitrary perturbation .",
    "section 5.2 introduces a special family of perturbations , which we call hamiltonian ones or generalized doob @xmath13-transforms .",
    "these include the usual perturbations considered in the physics literature .",
    "section 5.3 proves in a very simple way , thanks to the language of kinematics elements , that the recent * gfdt * @xcite are obtained in this general markovian context for the case of a hamiltonian perturbation .",
    "we also numerically verify the * gfdt * in the context of the example of section 4.3.2 involving stochastic dynamics with gaussian and poissonian white noise .",
    "section 5.4 presents the * gfdt * which result from a more general class of perturbations , such as a time change @xcite or a thermal perturbation pulse @xcite .",
    "the second crucial section is section 6 . here , we present global ( non - perturbative ) versions of these * gfdt * which involve a family of functionals called exponential martingales in the probability literature @xcite .",
    "originally , a martingale referred to a class of betting strategies , but this notion has now become central to the modern probability theory and characterizes , ironically , a model of a fair game . a martingale is process whose expectation in the future , given the knowledge accumulated up to now , is its present value @xcite . in section 6.1 ,",
    "we present a family of exponential martingales , which are natural objects associated with the hamiltonian perturbations because they are the ratio of the trajectory measures of the perturbed and the unperturbed processes .",
    "moreover , we prove in section 6.1.3 that they also provide global versions of the gfdt . finally , in section 6.2",
    ", we revisit , in the light of the martingale theory , the usual * fr * for quite general markov processes and underline the relation with the previously considered exponential martingales .",
    "in particular , this rationalizes the typical martingale form @xmath14 of the jarzynski equality .",
    "section 7 presents our conclusions .",
    "the appendices collect some simple but technical arguments .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , our study deals with nonequilibrium systems modeled by markov processes .",
    "we begin by recollecting below some basic properties of a markov process @xcite .",
    "we consider a continuous time markov process @xmath15 which takes values in a space @xmath16 .",
    "the space @xmath16 could , for example , be @xmath11 or a counting space .",
    "the dynamics of the process is given by a family of transition functions .",

    ", the notation @xmath24 represents the lebesgue measure or the counting measure , depending on @xmath16 .",
    "we will assume for simplicity that the transition functions and all other relevant functions admit a density with respect to this measure ( i.e. , @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , we consider processes without death or explosion , i.e. , with so - called honest transition probabilities , such that one has the normalization condition @xmath26 .",
    "this could be easily achieved in general , e.g. , by enlarging the space to include a coffin state .",
    "it will be useful to think of the transition functions as linear operators @xmath27 which form an inhomogeneous semi - group , and which are defined by their action on a bounded function @xmath28 in @xmath16 in the following way : @xmath29(x)\\equiv \\int dyp_{s}^{t}(x , y)f(y).\\ ] ] the family of transition functions of a markov process which can be written down explicitly is very restrictive .",
    "hence , it is more practical to define the generator @xmath30 of this inhomogeneous semi - group , under appropriate regularity conditions @xcite , by the following equation : @xmath31 this equation is equivalent to the forward and backward kolmogorov equation , given , respectively , by @xmath32 here , the symbol @xmath33 means composition of operators .",

    "next , it will be useful to define a path measure @xmath45 } [ dx ] \\equiv dm_{\\mu _ { 0},\\left [ s , t\\right ] } [ x]$ ] on the space of trajectories by the following equation : @xmath46\\,m_{\\mu _ { 0},\\left [ s , t\\right ] } [ dx],\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is a functional of the path from time @xmath23 to time @xmath48 . the instantaneous ( or single time )",

    "@xmath54 if the process is time - homogeneous , the above equation is equivalent to the usual detailed balance condition for the transition function : @xmath55 it will be useful to define two particular families of non - stationary states .",

    "finally , the condition @xmath82 can be rewritten as the equilibrium condition .",

    "the notion of the velocity operator ( [ jv ] ) introduced in the last section is quite different from the usual notion of velocity as the derivative of the position .",
    "assume that we want to describe the `` naive '' kinematics of a general markov process .",
    "the first difficulty is that the trajectories in general are non - differentiable ( as in a diffusion process ) or , worse , discontinuous ( as in a jump process ) .",
    "this does not allow for a straightforward definition of a velocity .",
    "in the sixties , nelson circumvented this difficulty by introducing the notion of forward and backward * stochastic derivatives * in his seminal work concerning diffusion process with additive noise @xcite . here",
    ", we will reproduce the definition of nelson for a general markov process . in the following ,",
    "we assume existence conditions on various quantities , with the expectation that these conditions have already been , or , can be established by rigorous mathematical studies .      according to nelson",
    ", a markov process is said to be mean - forward differentiable if the limit @xmath87 exists . in this case , this ratio defines the local forward velocity for a process conditioned to be in @xmath22 at time @xmath48 : @xmath88 similarly , the local backward velocity is defined as @xmath89 the local symmetric velocity and the local osmotic velocity are defined as @xmath90 in the same spirit , he defined the stochastic forward , backward and symmetric derivatives of function @xmath91 of the process as @xmath92 note that the set of forward , backward and symmetric local velocities are just special cases of derivatives of the function @xmath93 with the definition of the forward transition probability and the cotransition probability given in ( [ 2pf ] ) and ( [ 2pb ] ) , we can rewrite the above equations as @xmath94 a taylor expansion of these transition probabilities using ( [ gen ] ) and ( [ sgb - lb ] ) gives @xmath95 also , the stochastic symmetric derivative becomes @xmath96 the expression of the cogenerator from ( [ lstardp ] ) allows us to express the stochastic symmetric derivative in ( [ sd ] ) in terms of the velocity operator ( [ jv ] ) as @xmath97\\mathcal{i}}{2}.   \\label{sd}\\ ] ] then , for a steady state ( [ ss ] ) , @xmath98 .",
    "we can then deduce that , in the equilibrium case , the stochastic symmetric derivative takes the form of the partial time derivative @xmath99 , which gives zero while acting on observables which do not depend explicitly on time .",
    "the local symmetric velocity , given in ( [ sov ] ) , now reads @xmath100-l_{t}^{\\ast } [ x]}{2}=\\frac { v_{t}[x^{i}]-v_{t}[1]x^{i}}{2 } ,   \\label{v}\\ ] ] and then , for a steady state , @xmath101}{2}$ ] .",
    "it is important to remark that equilibrium ( @xmath102 ) implies vanishing of the local symmetric velocity but the converse of this statement is not true .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] illustrates the relation between stationarity , equilibrium and vanishing of the local symmetric velocity .",
    "one of the authors of the present article proved in @xcite that a diffusion process in the lagrangian frame of its mean local symmetric velocity takes an equilibrium form , and then the concept of equilibrium and nonequilibrium become closer than usually perceived . however , this property is no longer true for a general process due to the inequivalence between equilibrium and vanishing of the local symmetric velocity .",
    "here we provide useful formulae for the time derivative of the two - time ( @xmath103 ) correlation of observables @xmath104 and @xmath105 in terms of the correlation of stochastic derivatives ( forward or backward ) of these observables .",
    "the two - point correlation can be expressed in term of the forward transition probability and cotransition probability , ( [ 2pf ] ) , ( [ 2pb ] ) , as @xmath106 we then obtain the formula    @xmath107    the proofs are direct consequence of the definition of transition and cotransition probabilities ( [ gen],[sgb - lb ] ) and of forward and backward stochastic derivatives , and are given in appendix ( [ dcor ] ) .",
    "these relations provide motivation for a proof of generalizations of * fdt * by involving the stochastic derivatives , as discussed later in the paper .",
    "we will now investigate the form of the velocity operator ( [ jv ] ) and of the local symmetric velocity ( [ v ] ) for the three most popular examples of markov processes , namely , the pure jump process , the diffusion process and a process generated by a stochastic equation with both gaussian and poissonian white noise .      roughly speaking , a markov process is called a pure jump process ( or , a pure discontinuous process ) if , after `` arriving '' into a state , the system stays there for an exponentially - distributed random time interval .",
    "it then jumps into another state chosen randomly , where it spends a random time , and so on .",
    "more precisely , @xmath15 is a pure jump process if , during an arbitrary time interval @xmath108 $ ] , the probability that the process undergoes one unique change of state ( respectively , more that one change of state ) is proportional to @xmath109 ( respectively , infinitesimal with respect to @xmath110 @xcite . in a countable space , one can show that all markov processes ( with right continuous trajectories ) are of this type , a property which is not true in a general space .",
    "it is usual to introduce the intensity function @xmath111 such that @xmath112 is the probability that @xmath15 undergoes a random change in the time interval @xmath108 $ ] if the actual state is @xmath113 .",
    "if this change occurs , then @xmath114 is distributed with the transition matrix @xmath115 .",
    "such a process naturally generalizes a markov chain to continuous time .",

    "a particular form of ( [ e0 ] ) which is very popular in physics is the so - called overdamped langevin form ( with the einstein relation ) : @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the hamiltonian of the system ( the time index corresponds to an explicit time dependence ) , @xmath135is a family of non - negative matrices ,  @xmath136 is an external force ( or a shear ) , @xmath137 the reciprocal of the bath temperature and @xmath138 is an additional spurious term which comes from the @xmath22 dependence of the noise .",
