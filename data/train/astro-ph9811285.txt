    "supersoft x - ray sources ( hereafter called sss ) were discovered by einstein , established by rosat ( trmper et al .",
    "1991 ) and are now commonly accepted to be close binary systems with a white dwarf primary .",
    "little is known about the nature of the companion star .",
    "the accretion rate in these systems is relatively high ( in the order of @xmath7y@xmath8 ) so that the accreted hydrogen burns steadily on the surface of the white dwarf ( van den heuvel et al .",
    "several sss are now known , most of them in the lmc and in m31 .",
    "a detailed list can be found in greiner ( 1996 ) .",
    "only two sss are known in our galaxy ; one of them is rxj0019.8 + 2156 ( hereafter called rxj0019 ) , which was discovered by beuermann et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "sss are characterized by their high x - ray luminosity from 10@xmath9 ergs@xmath8 to 10@xmath10 ergs@xmath8 and by extremely soft x - ray spectra with blackbody temperatures between 2060 ev .",
    "most of the optical luminosity probably originates in the bright accretion disk : in a radially extended and vertically elevated accretion disk rim a substantial fraction of the soft x - ray flux from the white dwarf is reprocessed to optical and uv - light .",
    "this model successfully accounts for features observed in the optical lightcurves of some sss such as cal87 , rxj0019 and rxj0513.9 - 6951 ( meyer - hofmeister et al .",
    "most of the optical lightcurves presented in this paper have also been used by meyer - hofmeister et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for their analysis .",
    "they argue that the short time variability is caused by changes in the height of the accretion disk rim .",
    "an elevated rim is therefore the premise for explaining the luminosity in optical bands .",
    "this picture of a bright accretion disk is also invoked by other authors ( popham & distefano 1996 , matsumoto & fukue 1998 ) .",
    "rxj0019 is a unique object .",
    "it is the brightest and nearest among the known sss . with its position well outside the galactic plane and its visual brightness of @xmath11@xmath012.5@xmath12 rxj0019 offers an outstanding opportunity to investigate a sss very closely with indirect imaging techniques such as doppler tomography .",
    "here we report on such an approach to investigate rxj0019 .    in sect .",
    "2 we refer to our observations of rxj0019 and the data reduction procedures used .",
    "section 3 deals with the results and analysis of our data . finally , in sect .",
    "4 a summary and discussion of this paper are given .",
    "rxj0019 has been monitored regularly at the wendelstein observatory from 1992 to 1995 ( will & barwig 1996 ) .",
    "follow - up observations were made in autumn 1996 .",
    "we were able to observe this object on 15 nights between october and december 1996 .",
    "a special approach to investigate rxj0019 was made in october 1997 .",
    "we performed simultaneous spectroscopy and spectrophotometry at the 3.5 m and 2.2 m telescope at calar alto , respectively .",
    "detailed information about the individual observing campaigns is given in tables [ photo ] to [ twin ] .",
    "high - speed photometric observations of rxj0019 were performed using the multichannel multicolor photometer mccp ( barwig et al . 1987 ) at the 80 cm telescope at the wendelstein observatory in the bavarian alps . with this photometer",
    "we can monitor the object , a nearby comparison star and the sky background simultaneously in _ ubvri .",
    "the mccp allows a nearly complete elimination of atmospheric transparency variations and extinction effects ( barwig et al .",
    "1987 ) , by subtracting the sky background of each color channel and dividing the object by the comparison star measurement afterwards .",
    "therefore , photometric measurements were possible even under non - photometric conditions . during the 1996 run",
    "we were able to add another 88.7 hours of observation time for rxj0019 to our existing dataset . _    as comparison star we used the star at @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( for epoch 2000.0 ) .",
    "the intensities of the light - curves presented in fig .",
    "[ lc ] are calculated relative to this star .",
    "the error in the relative count rate is @xmath15 . in order to normalize the individual channels ,",
    "calibration measurements were performed during photometric conditions once or twice a night .",
    "the constancy of the calibration coefficients is indicative of the high stability of our detectors .",
    "all observations were made with an integration time of 2sec .",
    "except on the night of dec 10,1996 where we used an integration time of 1sec .",
    "a detailed journal of the observations is given in table [ photo ] .",
    ".[photo ] journal of photometric observations with mccp .",
    "truncated heliocentric julian date @xmath16 , h = hours , it = integration time [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     where @xmath17 is the orbital period , @xmath18 is the radial velocity of the primary , @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the mass of the white dwarf and the secondary , respectively , and @xmath21 is the inclination .",
    "the mass function is obviously very low .",
    "if the emission lines of are indeed related to the compact object we can deduce the mass of the companion . in fig .",
    "[ massf ] we plot our derived mass function for various inclinations @xmath21 .",
    "because of the arguments given in sect . 3.2 , we assume that the inclination is reasonably high .",
    "we conservatively estimate that the inclination ranges between @xmath22 .",
    "if the compact object is a white dwarf with @xmath23 , then we obtain @xmath24 for the mass of the companion .",
    "the companion star is almost certainly a low - mass object .",
    "this could explain why we do not see any spectral features of the companion in our high resolution spectra .",
    "as low mass functions are also known from other sss ( e.g. crampton et al .",
    "1996 , hutchings et al .",
    "1998 ) , a low mass companion star may be common among this class of objects .",
    "a possible evolutionary scenario for low - mass secondaries in sss is proposed by vanteeseling & king ( 1998 ) .",
    "doppler tomography is an useful tool to extract further information on the emission line origin from trailed spectra .",
    "this indirect imaging technique , which was developed by marsh & horne ( 1988 ) , uses the velocity of emission lines at each phase to create a two - dimensional intensity image in velocity space coordinates @xmath25 .",
    "the doppler map can be interpreted as a projection of emitting regions in accreting binary systems onto the plane perpendicular to the observer s line of sight .",
    "the doppler map is a function of the velocity @xmath25 , where the @xmath26-axis points from the white dwarf to the secondary and the @xmath27-axis points in the direction of the secondary s motion .",
    "an image pixel with given velocity coordinates @xmath25 produces an s - wave with the radial velocity @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath1 denote the system velocity and the phase , respectively .    to accomplish this , a linear tomography algorithm , the fourier - filtered back - projection ( ffbp )",
    "is used , which is described in detail by horne ( 1991 ) . the resulting doppler map ( or tomogram )",
    "is displayed as a grey - scale image . to assist in interpreting doppler maps we also mark the position of the secondary star and the ballistic trajectory of the gas stream . assuming a keplerian velocity field , emission originating in the inner parts of the disk has a larger velocity and thus appears in the outer regions of the map .",
    "therefore , an image in such a representation is turned inside - out . for the tomogram analysis we restricted our investigation to the two balmer lines h@xmath5 and h@xmath6 and the emission lines ( @xmath304686 ) and ( @xmath304542 ) .",
    "no reasonable doppler maps could be produced for other emission lines because of their poor s / n ratios .    before computing the tomograms we subtracted the underlying continuum from the individual emission lines , since their line flux is the quantity needed to produce these maps .",
    "this was done by subtracting from each pixel row of the trailed spectra the corresponding median of the intensity .",
    "we achieved a fwhm resolution of 150 kms@xmath8 in the central regions of the tomograms , whereas at higher velocities ( @xmath0800kms@xmath8 ) the resolution of the maps suffers a considerable degradation .",
    "linear structures in the high velocity regions ( fig .",
    "[ tomo ] ) of the maps are sampling artifacts ( aliasing streaks ) which are not taken into account in the further interpretation . for a detailed discussion about sampling artifacts",
    "see e.g. robinson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ trail ] we present the trailed spectra of the emission lines in v , @xmath1-coordinates ; the doppler tomograms are shown in fig .",
    "the schematic overlays in the doppler maps represent the roche - lobe of the companion star and the gas stream .",
    "they are a function of @xmath18 and @xmath31 . from our discussion in sect .",
    "3.3 we have taken 1@xmath32 for the white dwarf and a 0.5@xmath32 companion star .",
    "the center of mass and the location of the white dwarf are respectively marked by a cross and a point below the roche lobe .",
    "the ballistic stream is represented by an arc originating from the secondary s roche lobe at the inner lagrangian point .",
    "this arc is marked every 0.1@xmath33 ( open circles , @xmath33 is the distance from the center of the primary to the inner lagrangian point ) as it accelerates towards the compact object .    in the balmer emission lines",
    "the blue side is truncated by the p - cygni absorption .",
    "no s - wave structures can be detected at h@xmath5 and h@xmath6 .",
    "the jet lines of h@xmath5 clearly show an orbital motion which is in phase with the motion of .",
    "the main emission component of h@xmath5 reveals almost no orbital motion ( compare table [ velo ] ) .",
    "therefore , we assume that the jet and the main emission do not have the same spatial origin .",
    "the trailed spectra of both lines show more details : in each spectrogram a weak s - wave component within the main emission can be detected .    the doppler tomograms ( fig .",
    "[ tomo ] ) of our data immediately reveal that the emission line distribution does not resemble a typical accretion disk .",
    "the usual shape of an accretion disk would appear as a dark extended ring in the inverse grey - scaled doppler images , e.g. compare with doppler maps of ip peg obtained with the same technique in wolf et al .",
    "our observed projected velocities are smaller than 350 kms@xmath8 . for a binary system with parameters mentioned above and a disk radius of @xmath34 cm ( @xmath35 is the volume radius of the roche lobe of the white dwarf )",
    "one finds a kepler velocity of 384 kms@xmath8 at the rim of the disk . as the kepler velocity increases rapidly within the accretion disk ,",
    "the observed emission can not originate within the disk if the inclination is high . for medium inclinations an origin only at the rim of the disk is possible .",
    "this conclusion is valid for a huge variety of system parameters ( fig .",
    "[ kepler ] ) .",
    "low inclinations are excluded ( see discussion in sect .",
    "3.2 ) .",
    "( @xmath35 is the volume radius of the roche lobe of the white dwarf ) over mass ratio @xmath36 for various masses @xmath37 of the white dwarf and inclinations @xmath38 and @xmath39 . for the observed velocities",
    "it is clear that the emission lines can not originate within the accretion disk . for medium inclinations",
    "an origin only at the rim of the disk is possible . ]",
    "the dim ring in the map of h@xmath5 at a velocity of @xmath40 kms@xmath8 is due to the emission from the jet lines .",
    "the balmer lines originate at locations with almost no or only very low velocities .",
    "all of the observed flux is symmetrically distributed around the center of mass extending to velocities of roughly 350 kms@xmath8 .",
    "the intense emission maximum is located near the center of mass .",
    "part of this emission might come from the irradiated secondary , but as the maximum of the emission is clearly shifted to @xmath41 kms@xmath8 an irradiated secondary probably can not account for all of the observed flux .",
    "the doppler map of h@xmath6 looks similar .",
    "again , the whole flux including the intense maximum is distributed symmetrically around the center of mass .",
    "the doppler maps from the helium lines are slightly different .",
    "comparable to the balmer emission the observed flux originates at locations with very low velocities .",
    "the intensity distribution as a whole is distributed roughly symmetrical around the center of mass .",
    "but the emission maximum of the helium lines is not centered at the center of mass .",
    "the coordinates of this intense maximum are shifted to approximately @xmath42@xmath0100 kms@xmath8 and @xmath43@xmath0100 kms@xmath8 in both maps .",
    "this emission maximum does not coincide with the gas stream trajectory .",
    "but due to its position in velocity space the emission might originate in the elevated and radially extended accretion disk rim as proposed by meyer - hofmeister et al .",
    "thus , the helium emission might partly be related to the outermost accretion disk rim .",
    "the ( @xmath34686 ) map also indicates emission from regions near the white dwarf , which supports our assumptions in sect .",
    "3.3 for the estimation of the mass of the secondary .",
    "another indication about where this material might be located is given by the fact that the emission is roughly centered on the center of mass and not on the primary as would be expected for a typical accretion disk .",
    "this material might perhaps orbit the binary system around the mass center far outside of both roche lobes . in a very simplified estimate",
    "one finds a distance of @xmath44 cm for the above given binary parameters and a supposed velocity of 150 kms@xmath8 for the emitting circum - binary material .",
    "this is about 3.5 times the distance of the binary separation .",
    "we performed high - speed photometric and spectrophotometric observations as well as high - resolution spectroscopy of the bright galactic sss rxj0019 between 1992 and 1997 .",
    "our detailed optical studies result in a new determination of the orbital period .",
    "we observed a color variation in @xmath45 symmetrical to the main minimum with an amplitude of @xmath46=0.15@xmath12 .",
    "the observed lightcurves change between having a flat appearance ( quiet optical state ) and showing humps and steps with a 1.8h period ( excited optical state ) .",
    "rxj0019 can change between the two states from night to night .",
    "these variations might be due to short - term changes of the mass accretion rate from the companion star .",
    "our spectroscopic investigation shows the well known emission line spectrum of mainly balmer and helium ii lines .",
    "symmetric emission lines adjacent to the balmer lines show the presence of high velocity outflows ( jets ) probably originating near the white dwarf .",
    "the jet lines show an orbital doppler motion comparable to that of the lines .",
    "the velocity of the jet is quite low , indicating a medium to high inclination of the system .    from the radial velocities we calculated the mass function .",
    "for the assumed range of medium to high inclinations we derive a low mass for the secondary star ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "low mass companion stars might be common among the sss .",
    "this might also be an explanation for the absence of any spectral features of the companion star in the high resolution spectra .",
    "we also observe p - cygni profiles in the balmer lines showing an orbital modulation .",
    "the p - cygni absorption almost disappears between @xmath1@xmath20.7 to 0.9 .",
    "higher transitions of the balmer series up to h@xmath48 are only detected by their corresponding p - cygni absorption .",
    "the velocity of the directed wind responsible for the p - cygni profiles is @xmath0590kms@xmath8 with the absorption wings extending to 900kms@xmath8 .",
    "our trailed spectra show substructures of different components .",
    "as these components are very weak or were observed in lines with bad s / n ratio the locations of these components can not clearly be located by the means of doppler tomography .",
    "the shifted intensity maximum in the helium maps at @xmath42@xmath0100 kms@xmath8 and @xmath43@xmath0100 kms@xmath8 might be due to a radially extended and elevated accretion disk rim , consistent with theoretical models of sss .",
    "but we clearly see that most of the line - emitting material is not located within the accretion disk . due to the high accretion rate and viscous processes involved",
    "we assume that , almost the whole accretion disk is optically thick . therefore , no emission from balmer and helium lines originating at the inner parts of the disk can be observed .",
    "we only see line - emitting material with very low velocities .",
    "the emission distribution is mainly symmetrical around the center of mass . as material can not be stationary at the center of mass the emission must originate at regions with very low velocities .",
    "low velocities can be found far outside of the binary system .",
    "therefore , we propose that this sss has a circumbinary cocoon or disk of hydrogen and helium responsible for the observed emission lines .",
