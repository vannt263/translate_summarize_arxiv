    "the spitzer space telescope ( werner et al .  2004 ) , one of the four nasa s great observatories , is a 0.85 meter diameter , f/12 infrared ( ir ) telescope launched on august 25 , 2003 .",
    "it has an earth - trailing heliocentric orbit so that the telescope is kept away from the earth s heat and can be cooled more efficiently .",
    "spitzer has three science instruments : + ( 1 ) the infrared array camera ( irac ; fazio et al .",

    "+ ( 3 ) the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; houck et al .",
    "2004 ) has four modules that allow us to take spectra with a high ( @xmath2600 ) or low ( @xmath264128 ) resolution over the spectral range of 538 @xmath0 m .",
    "+ when the liquid helium coolant was exhausted , the `` warm spitzer '' phase started in may 2009 , and only irac detectors at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m remained useful .",
    "spitzer observations of pne have been obtained by guaranteed time observers ( gtos ) , guest observers ( gos ) , or legacy surveys of the galactic plane and the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc & smc ) .",
    "the gtos are associated with the spitzer instrument builders , and the gos are open to the public .",
    "the surveys of the galactic plane have been made for @xmath365@xmath4 and @xmath51@xmath4 in the four irac bands ( glimpse i and glimpse ii ) and in mips 24 @xmath0 m ( mipsgal i and mipsgal ii ) .",
    "the irac observations were extended to higher galactic latitudes for selected longitudes ( glimpse 3d ) in all four bands , and extended to cover the rest of the galactic plane in 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m during the warm spitzer mission ( glimpse360 ) .",
    "a large number of pne are expected to be covered by these glimpse and mipsgal observations .",
    "the lmc and smc were surveyed in all irac and mips bands ( sage - lmc ; sage - smc ; s@xmath6mc ) .",
    "all pne , except the outlying members , in the lmc and smc were included in these surveys .",
    "the four irac bands contain different combinations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features , hi recombination lines , h@xmath7 rotational transitions , and forbidden lines of atoms / ions , as marked in table 1 and seen in the iso spectra of ngc 7027 ( bernard - salas et al .",

    "nevertheless , irac images often reveal morphological features that bear implications on pn formation mechanisms but are less well seen in other wavelengths .",

    "( 2008 ) and gruendl & chu ( 2009 ) , pne are well separated from stars in color - color and color - magnitude diagrams , but overlap significantly with young stellar objects and background galaxies . to unambiguously identify pne , morphological information of the nebulae and their environments and/or spectra are still needed .",
    "an interesting color evolution , shown in the right panels of figure 5 , has been noted by cohen et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ; the irac 5.8 @xmath0 m band flux increases with pn size and it is attributed to an increasing contribution from the 6.2 @xmath0 m pah band emission as pne age .",
    "the three mips bands , 24 , 70 , and 160 @xmath0 m , are ideal for investigation of dust continuum emission ; however , their point - spread functions , fwhm 6@xmath10 , 18@xmath10 , and 40@xmath10 , respectively , severely limit the number of pne that are adequately resolved in the 70 and 160 @xmath0 m bands for detailed analysis .",
    "spatially resolved analyses of pne utilizing all mips bands have been reported for only two bipolar nebulae , ngc 2346 and ngc 650 . for ngc 2346 ,",
    "su et al .  (",
    "2004 ) show that the 24 @xmath0 m image exhibits a bipolar morphology resembling that seen in the optical [ n ii ] image , the 70 @xmath0 m emission is concentrated in a torus where the bipolar lobes join , and the 160 @xmath0 m emission is much more extended and showing spherical symmetry .",
    "they suggest that the mass loss changed from spherical symmetric to non - spherical due to the binary central star of ngc 2346",
    ". for ngc 650 , ueta ( 2006 ) finds the 24 @xmath0 m image similar to the [ o iii ] image and suggests that the [ o  iv ] 25.89 @xmath0 m line emission dominates the mips 24 @xmath0 m band flux ; he finds the 70 and 160 @xmath0 m emission in the torus / waist more extended than the 24 @xmath0 m emission and suggests that mass loss was mainly in the equatorial , rather than polar , directions .",
    "mips 24 @xmath0 m images of pne are useful in revealing regions of high ionization as well as dust emission .",
    "the mips 24 @xmath0 m band includes high - ionization [ o iv ] 25.89 @xmath0 m and [ ne  v ] 24.3 @xmath0 m lines and dust continuum that are frequently seen in pne . large numbers of mips 24 @xmath0 m observations of pne have been reported by phillips & marguez - lugo ( 2011 ) and chu et al .",
    "the former investigation used the mipsgal data ( each @xmath130  s exposure ) to analyze 224 pne in the galactic plane , comparing the 24 @xmath0 m profiles to irac profiles and constructing color - color diagrams .",
    "the latter obtained 24 @xmath0 m images for 36 pne each with 420  s exposure , compared the 24 @xmath0 m profiles to h@xmath8 profiles , and obtained irs spectra to probe the nature of the 24 @xmath0 m emission .",
    "h@xmath8 emission is an excellent tracer for dense ionized gas . comparing 24 @xmath0 m and h@xmath8 profiles , chu et al .",
    "( 2009 ) find three types of correspondences , as illustrated in figure  6 : ( 1 ) 24 @xmath0 m emission more extended than h@xmath8 emission  as the [ o iv ] and [ ne v ] lines originate from high - ionization regions , the 24 @xmath0 m emission from the outer parts of pne must be dominated by dust continuum ; ( 2 ) similar morphology and spatial extent between 24 @xmath0 m and h@xmath8  both line emission and dust continuum can contribute to the 24 @xmath0 m band flux ; ( 3 ) 24 @xmath0 m emission at center of h@xmath8 shell  low densities and high excitation are expected in central regions of pne , and thus the 24 @xmath0 m emission must be dominated by [ o iv ] and some [ ne v ] line emission . irs spectrum of the diffuse 24 @xmath0 m emission in the central region of sh 2 - 188 shows that the emission is indeed dominated by the [ o iv ] 25.89 @xmath0 m emission ( chu et al .",
    "2009 ) .     and 24 @xmath0 m images of ngc 6852 , a43 , and jner 1 .",
    "the right panels compare the h@xmath8 ( dark ) and 24 @xmath0 m ( grey ) surface brightness profiles .",
    "taken from chu et al .",
    "( 2009).,width=432 ]",
    "a picture is worth a thousand words , while a spectrum is worth a thousand pictures .",
    "the most exciting spitzer results of pne are derived from irs observations , which have many advantages over spectroscopic observations in optical wavelengths for studies of abundances of ionized gas , exciting / fundamental molecules , and dust properties .",
    "irs studies of abundances of ionized gas in pne have the following advantages : ( 1 ) extinction has little effects at mid - ir wavelengths ; ( 2 ) mid - ir transitions are close to the ground level and thus insensitive to the temperature ; ( 3 ) most ionization stages of ne , s , and ar are covered and thus there is no need to resort to ionization correction factors ; and ( 4 ) [ fe iii ] 22.93 @xmath0 m , [ fe ii ] 17.94 @xmath0 m , [ cl iv ] 20.32 and 11.76 @xmath0 m , and [ p  iii ] 17.89  @xmath0 m lines allow determinations of fe , cl , and p abundances .",
    "therefore , many galactic pne have been observed for abundance analyses , and the nebular abundances are further compared to models of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis to determine the mass of progenitor stars : ic 2448 , m 1 - 42 , ngc 2392 , ngc 2792 , ngc 3242 , ngc 6210 , ngc 6369 ( guiles et al .  2007 ;",

    "2008 , 2009a , 2009b ; pottasch & bernard - salas 2008 )",
    ". abundances of the halo pn dddm-1 have been analyzed by henry et al .",

    "bernard - salas et al .  ( 2004 ) analyzed the abundances of the lmc pn smp 83 .",
    "bernard - salas et al .  ( 2008 ) analyzed ne and s abundances for 25 pne in the lmc and smc , finding lmc and smc ne abundances to be @xmath11/3 and 1/6 of the galactic values , respectively ; furthermore , the ne / s ratio is higher in the mc pne , @xmath123.5 , than in the galactic pne , @xmath116 .",
    "shaw et al .  ( 2010 ) analyzed elemental abundances of he , n , o , ne , s , and ar for 14 pne in the smc , and found that ionization correction factors work well even in low - metalicity conditions , except for pne with very high ionization .",
    "the most exciting discovery in pne made by irs observations is the detection of fullerenes .",
    "c@xmath11 and c@xmath12 were produced in laboratory more than 25 years ago ( kroto et al .",
    "1985 ) , and they might be responsible for the diffuse interstellar bands and provide catalyst for prebiotic chemistry .",
    "however , they have not been unambiguously detected until irs observations of pne were made ( figure 7 ) .",
    "cami et al .  ( 2010 ) reported the first detection of c@xmath11 and c@xmath12 in the pn tc 1 , and suggested that fullerenes can be produced only in h - deficient environments .",
    "however , this suggestion has been challenged by garca - hernndez et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , who detected fullerene in h - containing pne in the galaxy and in the smc .",
    "the simultaneous presence of pahs and fullerenes is suggestive that they may both be formed by photochemical processing of hydrogenated amorphous carbons .",
    "irs spectra of 11 pne in the galactic bulge have been studied by gutenkunst et al .",
    "these spectra are dominated by o - rich dust features ( crystalline silicates ) that are rare in disk pne ; furthermore , roughly 1/2 of these bulge pne also show c - rich dust features ( pahs ) , i.e. , dual chemistry .",
    "they suggest that the dual chemistry is caused by binary evolution , with the pahs located in the current outflow and the crystalline silicates in an old disk created by binary interaction .",
    "this mixed chemistry phenomenon in galactic bulge pne was re - examined by perea - caldern et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , who analyzed 40 galactic pne of which 26 belong to the bulge .",
    "these authors propose a different explanation for the dual chemistry  the final thermal pulse of the agb produced enhanced mass loss , removing the remaining h - rich envelope , exposing the c - rich layer , and generating shocks to produce the crystalline silicates .",
    "stanghellini et al .",
    "( 2007 ; this volume ) made irs observations of a large number of pne in the lmc and the smc .",
    "these observations will be complemented by images and long - slit spectra obtained with the hubble space telescope as well as ground - based telescopes . as the distances to these pne are well known , it is possible to analyze dust properties of these pne and compare them with the evolutionary status of their central stars for the most comprehensive picture .",
    "spitzer mips observations of the helix nebula show a bright unresolved source coincident with the central star in both the 24 and 70 @xmath0 m bands .",
    "followup irs observations confirm the dust continuum nature of this excess mid - ir emission .",
    "the color temperature of the ir emitter is 90 - 130 k , too cold to be a star .",
    "the ir luminosity requires an emitting area of 4 - 40 au@xmath13 , which can be provided only by a dust disk . for a stellar temperature of @xmath1110,000",
    "k , the dust disk must be 35 - 150 au from the central star .",
    "as such a distance corresponds to the kuiper belt in the solar system , su et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggest that the dusk disk is produced by collisions among kuiper belt - like objects .    to search for dust disks similar to that of the helix central star , chu et al .",

    "inspired by the prevalence of ir excesses in central stars of pne , bilikova et al.(this volume ) made an spitzer archival search for ir excesses of pn central stars and made followup spectroscopic observations using spitzer irs and gemini niri and michelle .",
    "while spectroscopic observations show that most of the ir excesses are dominated by dust continuum , some also show emission lines or even silicate features .",
