    "1981 )  a very wide definition . among galactic field b stars ,",
    "18% of b0 to b7 iii  v stars are be stars ( abt 1987 ) . while galactic be stars have been extensively investigated , little is known about the be star content of the magellanic clouds .",
    "the magellanic clouds have lower metallicity than usual for the young stellar population in the milky way , which affects opacity and stellar atmosphere properties , hence the study of be stars in the magellanic clouds may shed light on the formation mechanisms of the be phenomenon .",
    "the study of be stars in clusters has the added advantage of looking at a population homogeneous in age and metallicity , and of common origin .",
    "therefore , we have started a survey of be stars in magellanic cloud clusters .",
    "in the first paper of this be star survey ( grebel et al .",
    "1992 : paper i ) , we studied the young cluster ngc 330 in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) and found it to be unusually rich in be stars .",
    "our photometric survey technique uses imaging in three filters , one of them an @xmath0 filter .",
    "the colour index formed by the two other filters serves to separate blue stars from red stars . a colour index formed from the @xmath0 filter and one of the other filters",
    "is used to distinguish stars bright in h@xmath1 from the rest . in the resulting two - colour diagrams ( tcds )",
    "be star candidates stand out clearly .",
    "if the @xmath0 filter is used together with a continuum filter such as johnson - cousins @xmath2 , the strength of the h@xmath1 emission can be calibrated ( grebel et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "a comparison of the detections from the photometric survey of ngc 330 with those from grism surveys shows excellent agreement ( paper i ) . the photometric method has the added advantage of being able to operate also in very crowded regions and of allowing to distinguish between be stars and ordinary b stars .",
    "medium - resolution spectroscopy ( lennon et al .  1994 , grebel et al.1996 ) allows one to detect very weak - lined balmer emission stars that can not be distinguished by photometric techniques , though in practice medium - resolution spectroscopy is restricted to few stars with the currently available instruments owing to constraints on observing time .",
    "ccd imaging with two broadband filters and an @xmath0 filter is an efficient tool to identify be stars .",
    "the definition of a be star implies that _ all current detections establish only a lower limit to the true number of be stars_.    in the present paper , the be star content of ngc 1818 and the neighbouring smaller cluster in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) will be analyzed ( sect .",

    "there have been several spectroscopic abundance determinations for ngc 1818 .",
    "their results differ by more than half a dex in [ fe / h ] .",
    "the most recent studies are both based on medium - resolution spectra of five red supergiants : meliani et al .  ( 1994 ) find ngc 1818 to be relatively metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] = 0.9 dex ) , while jasniewicz & thvenin ( 1994 ) find it more metal - rich ( 0.4 dex )",
    ". the latter result may be the more reliable one since care was taken to eliminate contamination by blue stars that may lead to spuriously low metal abundances . for a summary of earlier spectroscopic abundance determinations based on fewer stars see will et al .",

    "possible reasons for this width are crowding and/or differential reddening . both the error bars and main sequence of the uncrowded field population are much narrower . in fig .",
    "[ 5108f2 ] , we plotted stars found in an outer and an inner annulus around the centre of ngc 1818 .",
    "the outermost annulus ( of stars considered to be largely cluster members , see above ) shows a relatively narrow , well - defined main sequence for which the isochrones serve well as an approximate blue envelope with our chosen reddening . in the innermost circle",
    ", stars fainter than @xmath27 were not found due to crowding , and the main sequence exhibits wide scatter",

    "the strange bifurcation pattern at the upper end of the main sequence already visible in the study by will et al .",
    "( 1995a ) originates predominantly from these innermost , very crowded stars and would probably vanish in high - resolution data such as hst imaging .",
    "[ 5108f2 ] also illustrates that the most massive stars ( in particular , supergiants ) are strongly concentrated toward the cluster centre .",
    "a comparison of stars in different regions within the 13 pc radius around ngc 1818 did not show significant colour offsets indicating that effects of differential reddening across ngc 1818 are small if present at all .",
    "age determinations based on isochrone fits to colour - magnitude diagrams were performed by will et al .",

    "the blue stars above the main - sequence turnoff as given by the isochrones and below the position of the blue supergiants are in part be stars , and possibly in part blue stragglers and/or binaries ( for a thorough discussion , see grebel et al .",
    "1996 ) , and , as just demonstrated , are strongly affected by crowding ( fig .",
    "[ 5108f2 ] ) .",
    "we consider stars more distant from ngc 1818 than 24 pc ( @xmath30 ) to be mostly field stars .",

    "there are no evolved ( i.e. , supergiant ) stars present in the small cluster",
    ". the lack of more massive stars may be due to small number statistics , a less massive birth cloud or subcloud , or due to disruption of star formation ( franco et al .",

    "the apparent absence of evolved stars and the very sparsely populated main sequence make it difficult to assign an age to ngc 1818b .",

    "plotting isochrones onto the cmd of ngc 1818b indicates that the reddening of this cluster is higher than that of ngc 1818a , namely @xmath42 mag .",
    "this may be due to the presence of differential reddening in this area , or a larger distance and thus higher reddening for ngc 1818b .",
    "it is also possible that star formation was less efficient for ngc 1818b and that there is still a higher concentration of dust and gas in this area .",
    "the currently available data do not yet allow to conclude whether the small cluster is associated with ngc 1818a .",
    "radial velocities and spectral types for the brightest stars would help to clarify this matter .",

    "these stars are blue stars with h@xmath1 emission , i.e. , our be star candidates . when a larger colour baseline involving red filters is plotted such as ( @xmath48 ) or ( @xmath49 ) is used , one can see that this band of stars is tilted such that the stars brightest in h@xmath1 tend to be redder than the fainter emission - line stars ( see figures in grebel et al .",

    "in grebel et al .  ( 1994 ) we investigated the fraction of be stars in comparison to ordinary b stars using simple magnitude bins whose width in @xmath16 magnitude corresponded to spectral subtypes as tabulated by schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) . the galactic be star frequencies were taken from jaschek & jaschek ( 1983 ) . however , this approach is not entirely correct .",
    "we compared be stars of supposedly common origin and supposedly similar age and chemical composition ( namely be stars in a specific cluster ) to galactic field be stars , thus be stars of quite different age , composition , and formation conditions . for a valid comparison ,",
    "be star fractions in milky way and in magellanic cloud clusters should be compared . lacking blue populous clusters in the milky way , young open clusters are best suited .",
    "secondly , the distribution of be stars with spectral type and their overall number depends on the age of the parent cluster ( mermilliod 1982 ) showed .",
    "the highest be star frequencies were found in clusters with turnoffs in the spectral region of b0.5 to b2 stars .",

    "close to the detection limit be stars are more likely to be detected in h@xmath1 than non - emission line b stars since they may be up to several tenths of a magnitude brighter . stars with very faint balmer emission can only be detected spectroscopically anyway ( see sect .  [ sect_intro ] ) .",
    "the fact that b - type stars may appear as be stars at certain times and as ordinary b stars at others affects the be star census in galactic open clusters and star clusters in the magellanic clouds equally .",
    "it is important to remember that all numbers represent only lower limits .    the galactic open clusters with the largest known",

    "many of these clusters have been observed repeatedly over many years , and spectroscopy is available for most of their bright b - type stars .",

    "since we are lacking adequate spectroscopic data for ngc 1818 and ngc 2004 , we have tried to assign spectral types to the be stars through a relationship between absolute visual magnitudes and spectral types .",
    "commonly used calibrations of spectral type versus absolute magnitudes such as the tabulations of schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) do not consider the considerable intrinsic dispersion of absolute magnitudes that exists in each magnitude ( zorec & briot 1991 ) .",

    "they find that be stars are as luminous or up to about 0.8 mag ( in @xmath16 ) more luminous than b stars of the same spectral type . due to their generally rapid rotation , departures from sphericity",

    "briot & zorec ( 1994 ) corrected for effects on galactic field be stars introduced by the over - luminosity of be stars , spectral type changes during constant mass evolution , and spectral type changes due to fast rotation .",

    "this effect will again depend on the inclination angle .",

    "it has to be emphasized that this stringent criterion introduces a strong selection effect not only for eligible b stars , but in particular for be stars .",
    "be stars are often catalogued simply as `` be '' without further classification , or with spectral type but without luminosity class .",
    "we compiled the spectroscopic data for galactic open clusters from slettebak ( 1985 ) , mermilliod ( 1988 ) , and buscombe ( 1995 ) .",
    "the latter two catalogues are largely complete compilations of prior spectroscopic studies referenced therein .",
    "we supplemented these data by photometric detections of be stars that had spectroscopic classifications but had not yet previously been identified as be stars .",

    "either no be stars had been detected or they were listed without mk classification .",
    "also , in many spectroscopic studies only the earliest b - type stars had been classified .",
    "these data can not serve to determine fractions of be stars .",
    "therefore , in fig .",
    "[ 5108f5 ] only ngc 330 is included based on the determination and compilation of spectral types in grebel et al .",
    "ngc 330 is the only cluster of our set with a larger database of mk classifications among its b - type stars .",
    "based on their position in a cmd , the few be stars classified as b2 iie have also been included in this diagram , since they have fainter @xmath16 magnitudes than the regular blue supergiants in ngc 330 and may be extreme be stars as discussed by schild ( 1966 ) and garmany & humphreys ( 1985 ) .",
    "as explained before , field be stars are not well suited for comparisons to cluster be stars because they span a range of ages and may have a range of metallicities . on the other hand , they may give a better idea of the overall distribution of be stars of different spectral types , since many more field be stars have spectral classifications than be stars within a specific cluster .",
    "several be star catalogues are available electronically .",
    "we found the catalogue of page ( 1984 ) to give the best number statistics . from this catalogue , we extracted all non - supergiant field be stars .",
    "the 1145 field be stars are plotted in the first panel of fig .",
    "[ 5108f5 ] . in all cases , we counted stars classified as b1.5 as b1 stars , b2.5 stars as b2 stars , etc .",
    "page s ( 1984 ) catalogue lists for each star all previous spectral classifications , and different studies may differ by several subclasses . in those cases , we usually chose the most frequently occurring classification , while in other be star catalogues preference has been given to spectral classifications from specific sources .",
    "e.g. , jaschek & egret s ( 1982 ) catalogue prefers the michigan spectral survey ( houk & cowley 1975 , houk 1978 ) .    in good agreement with earlier studies ,",

    "a small peak is seen for b8 stars in agreement with jaschek & egret ( 1982 ) and jaschek & jaschek ( 1983 ) .",
    "the small peak at b5 may be an artifact of the preferred classification of stars as b3 or b5 rather than b4 .",
    "mermilliod ( 1982 ) pointed out that the overall be star frequency is highest for young clusters containing early - type stars , while total numbers decrease for older clusters . in fig .",
    "[ 5108f5 ] , open clusters are arranged to form a sequence of increasing ages .",
    "we note in passing that age determinations for ob clusters may vary by up to a factor of two in different studies ( e.g. , pleiades : 80 myr according to meynet et al .",
    "1993 , 150 myr according to mazzei & pigatto 1989 ; @xmath1 per : 52 myr following meynet et al .",
    "1993 , 80 myr according to prosser 1992 ) .",
    "though small number statistics and the above discussed incompleteness affect our diagrams , they nicely demonstrate mermilliod s finding .",
    "frequency peaks in the be star distribution are found at b1 to b2 and , in the case of ngc 6611 , for which spectral typing for the entire range of b stars is the most complete , at b8 .",
    "as emphasized before , all b star numbers and especially be star numbers represent only lower limits .    despite incomplete spectral coverage , be star numbers vary significantly from cluster to cluster .",
    "a young age alone does not guarantee a high number of be stars ( compare ngc 2244 to h & @xmath55 per , ngc 6611 and ngc 663 to ic 2944 , ngc 4755 , and ngc 2264 , etc . ) .",
    "neither does metallicity , which for the displayed galactic clusters with known metal abundances is quite similar .",
    "a likely second parameter for the formation of be stars is rapid rotation ",
    "e.g. , the stars in h and @xmath55 per , the young galactic double cluster so rich in be stars , are known to be rapid rotators ( slettebak 1968 ) .",
    "the much older @xmath1 per , where also lower - mass stars often show h@xmath1 emission and be stars start with intermediate b spectral types , contains plenty of rapid rotators ( e.g. , prosser 1992 ) .",
    "the even older pleiades with their late - type be stars also show quite high @xmath66 sin @xmath67 values ( e.g. , abt 1970 ) .",

    "[ 5108f5 ] , but see buscombe 1995 ) . at the same time , it is known for its large fraction of binaries and , perhaps because of that , the low rotational velocities of its members ( e.g. , schild 1967 ) .",
    "the young smc cluster ngc 330 presents a pronounced frequency peak at b2 ( fig .",
    "[ 5108f5 ] ) .",
    "almost all of the non - supergiant b - type stars in this cluster for which spectroscopy exists have been found to be be stars ( lennon et al .",
    "1994 , grebel et al .",
    "1996 ) and , as is evident from the diagram , most of them are b2 stars .",
    "spectral classifications have only been performed for the brightest stars in this cluster which explains the lack of later be types .",

    "[ 5108f4 ] and fig .",
    "[ 5108f5 ] shows remarkable differences .",
    "spectral typing through the photometric calibration used in sect .",
    "[ secthistspec ] results in spectral types that are too early by two to three spectral subclasses .",
    "a comparison of individual stars shows , for instance , that most of the stars in ngc 330 that were assigned types of b0 and b1 are in fact b2 stars according to classification based on spectroscopy . for the pleiades ,",
    "the earliest b stars are of type b6 ( johnson & morgan 1953 ) , while the photometric calibration makes them b3 stars .",
    "this demonstrates that even very careful photometric calibrations are no substitute for spectroscopic classifications .",
    "it also implies that as of now , we can not yet compare directly be star fractions in young magellanic cloud clusters to galactic open clusters .",
    "a lot more spectral classification work is needed for the magellanic cloud clusters , and it would be highly desirable also to complete spectroscopic studies of the much more easily accessible galactic clusters .",
    "our current knowledge about be stars in the magellanic clouds does not yet allow to constrain be star theories . as was emphasized by smith ( 1988 ) , observations of galactic be stars have shown that there seem to be at least three independent causes for the be star phenomenon .",
    "it appears that rotation , pulsation , and multiplicity may all play a role . in the case of ngc 330 , at least some of the be stars are members of binary systems ( grebel et al .",
    "many galactic be stars , perhaps even most , are members of binary systems ( see discussion in abt et al .",
    "pols et al .",
    "( 1991 ) present models explaining the formation of be stars in close binary systems .",
    "pols & marinus ( 1994 ) use monte carlo simulations that convincingly reproduce binary main sequences as observed in galactic open clusters ( e.g. , mermilliod 1992 , mermilliod & maeder 1986 ) and lead to the formation of blue stragglers and be stars .",
    "the number of _ close , interacting _ binaries , however , is probably small ( slettebak 1988 ) both in the milky way and in the magellanic clouds ( van bever & vanbeveren 1996 ) .    that either rotation ( balona 1990 , balona et al",
    ".  1991 ) or non - radial pulsation ( baade 1987 , 1988 ) plays a role in ngc 330 is shown by the presence of @xmath68 eri variables discovered by balona ( 1992 ) .",
    "ngc 2004 , which we find to be not as rich in be stars as ngc 330 and ngc 1818 , also appears to contain only very few @xmath68 eri variables ( balona 1993 ) .",
    "balona ( 1990 ) suggests that the correlation between projected rotational velocities and photometric periods of be stars may be explained when the photometric period equals the rotational period .",
    "owocki et al .",
    "( 1994 ) predict that stars rotating with 90% of @xmath69 should exhibit strong variability .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy is needed to determine the rotational velocities of the variable stars in magellanic cloud clusters and to detect possible signatures of non - radial pulsations , or their absence .",
    "this will require a substantial amount of observing time at the new generation of very large telescopes .",
    "a very elegant theory for the formation of equatorial disks , which is capable to account for many of the observed features in be stars was presented by bjorkman & cassinelli ( 1993 ) .",
    "this wind - compressed disk model for line - driven winds was then extended by owocki et al .",
    "( 1994 ) to include a full dynamical treatment of gas pressure and radiative driving .",
    "disks form in the following way for stars with large enough rotation thresholds : at low latitudes near the surface of a star , the gravity acceleration is larger than the radiative acceleration , and fluid streamlines `` fall '' toward the equator , where fluids from both hemispheres collide . standing shocks form above and below the equator , between which a dense equatorial disk is confined by the ram pressure of the wind .",
    "a disk will form when the rotation rate is above a threshold value depending on the ratio of the terminal velocity of the wind ( @xmath70 ) and the escape velocity from the star ( @xmath71 ) . for spectral types from o to b2 ,",
    "this velocity ratio decreases as the terminal velocity decreases .",
    "for instance , an o6 star has to rotate at 84% of its critical velocity ( @xmath69 ) in order to form a disk , while for a b2 star 48% of @xmath69 suffices .",
    "thus from the theoretical predictions the frequency peak of be stars is expected at b2 , which seems to be confirmed observationally ( sect .",
    "[ secthistspec ] ) . for a @xmath72 km s@xmath73 ,",
    "the rotation threshold for a b2 star is @xmath74 km s@xmath73 assuming a uniform distribution of inclination angles ( sin(@xmath67 ) = @xmath75 ) .",
    "observationally , however , @xmath76 slowly continues to drop , which bjorkman & cassinelli ( 1993 ) attribute to a possible underestimation of @xmath70 for b stars of later types because of weak line profiles of civ and siiv .",
    "currently , the predicted disk density is by a factor of 100 too small to reproduce the observed ir excess , h@xmath1 emission , and polarization .",
    "this could be remedied if mass - loss rates are in fact higher than currently estimated , which reduces the initial acceleration of the wind by decreasing the radiative line - driving force .",
    "furthermore , while the current model predicts both infall and outflow from the equatorial disk , the infall could be prevented by rotationally supporting the disk material .",
    "a weak magnetic field may already be sufficient to add angular momentum to the disk ( bjorkman 1994 ) .",
    "the be star phenomenon should thus be enhanced by reducing the terminal velocity of the wind .",
    "the more metal - rich a star is , the more photons will be absorbed , which transfers their momentum to the absorbing material and accelerates the gas by radiation pressure .",
    "this metal - rich wind is emitted radially and may have too high velocities to be withheld by the centripetal force , thus gets lost and can not contribute to forming a disk .",
    "however , in a _ metal - poor _ environment , the radiation pressure is obviously lower , which in turn leads to lower terminal velocities . in a metal - poor environment , stars are more likely to have terminal velocities that are smaller than the centripetal acceleration , thus the gas slows down and is more easily confined . according to this intuitive scenario ( bjorkman 1995 ) , be stars should form preferably in metal - poor environments .",
    "lower wind speeds will generally lead to the formation of stronger disks ( owocki et al .",
    "1994 ) . however , the latest calculations by owocki et al .",
    "( 1996 ) indicate that the wind - compressed disk model does not work when non - radial forces and distortion due to rapid rotation are considered .",
    "both lead to stronger poleward components of the radiative flux and prevent the formation of disks .    as we discussed in sect .",
    "[ sectbe_prob ] , the currently available data do not yet allow one to make quantitative statements about be star fractions both in galactic and in magellanic cloud clusters . clearly , additional spectral classification and high - resolution spectroscopic studies are needed .",
    "however , we can already state that ngc 330 and ngc 1818 are rich in be stars .",
    "high be star fractions are also found in more metal - rich galactic open clusters ( sect.[sectbe_prob ] )",
    ". it would be interesting to determine terminal gas velocities for stars in these clusters .",
    "of course , other factors , such as intrinsic rapid rotation , will contribute as well to the be star phenomenon  perhaps stars in the metal - poor lmc cluster ngc 2004 , which has a lower be - star frequency , are rotating at lower velocities .",
    "the evolutionary status of be stars has long been under debate . that many of them appear spectroscopically and photometrically as subgiants , giants , or even bright giants may be due to effects of rapid rotation , binarity or multiplicity , and ( infra-)red excess .",
    "the effects of rotation on spectral classification and on the position in the cmd were studied by slettebak et al .",
    "( 1980 ) and collins et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , and pols & marinus ( 1994 ) showed the influence of binarity on the position of main - sequence stars .",
    "these effects can easily make main - sequence stars appear as giants .",
    "furthermore , be stars are known as rapid rotators .",
    "finally , reddening caused by the circumstellar disks and the red excess of be stars will move them further on to lower temperatures .",
    "the study of be stars in clusters , i.e. , stellar aggregates that are supposedly coeval and of the same origin , may help to constrain the evolutionary status of be stars .",
    "the young ages of our three magellanic cloud clusters make it seem likely that at least there the non - supergiant b - type stars are still burning hydrogen in their cores and thus are in the evolutionary phase of main - sequence stars ( grebel et al .",
    "we have combined new @xmath2 and @xmath0 photometry with our @xmath77 photometry of ngc 1818 ( will et al .",
    "we have used the combined data set to investigate the be star content of ngc 1818 and surroundings using our photometric detection method ( grebel et al .",
    "1992 , 1994 ) .",
    "a table with photometry , astrometric positions , and designations complying with iau recommendations for all detected be stars down to 18th magnitude in ngc 1818 and surroundings is available electronically from cds , strasbourg .",
    "re - analyzing the ngc 1818 photometry , we find a small cluster @xmath41 southeast of ngc 1818 apparently not mentioned in the literature before , which we have named ngc 1818 b. this cluster seems to have an age of at least 30 myr and a reddening of @xmath78 mag , 0.04 mag higher than what we found for the similarly old ngc 1818 .",
    "differential reddening does not seem to be present across ngc 1818 . due to its sparse main sequence and lack of evolved stars ,",
    "it is difficult to assign an age to ngc 1818 b. the current data do not allow to determine whether the small cluster is associated with ngc 1818 .    in both clusters",
    ", we find a large number of be stars , while the field has almost none .",
    "the field shows a few young , massive stars comparable or slightly older than ngc 1818 in age .",
    "the majority of the field population appears to be of intermediate age .    for a valid comparison with galactic be stars , fractions in galactic clusters comparable in age have to be compared to the magellanic clusters . only be stars in clusters are likely to be coeval , equidistant , of the same metallicity , and to have a common origin . in attempting to determine be star fractions in galactic open clusters and in the three magellanic cloud clusters that we have analyzed to date ,",
    "ngc 1818 , ngc 2004 , and ngc 330 , we find that assigning b spectral types through photometry leads to systematic shifts to too early spectral types when compared to spectroscopic classifications .",
    "only spectroscopy gives reliable spectral classifications .",
    "a comparison of currently available spectroscopic classifications for b and be stars in clusters appears to confirm that there is a frequency peak at types b1 to b2 , as suggested by mermilliod ( 1982 ) for open clusters and from the frequency distribution of field be stars .",
    "quantitative determinations of be star fractions and studies of possible dependence of be star numbers on other parameters such as metallicity can only be performed once a more complete spectral classification coverage will be obtained for both magellanic and galactic clusters .",
    "on the basis of the current data , it can not be assessed whether low low metallicity facilitates the formation of be stars due to lower wind terminal velocities .",
