    "in the rapidly - developing field of relativistic nuclear collision physics , questions related to the distribution of partons in nucleons and nuclei are of great current interest .",
    "the modification of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in the nuclear environment has attracted growing attention ever since the pioneering emc experiment@xcite . at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , we are well - positioned to study the nuclear pdfs ( npdfs ) in a center - of - mass energy and transverse - momentum domain where perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) is expected to work well .",
    "thus , hadron production in nuclear collision experiments at rhic should provide information on how such nonperturbative ingredients of pqcd as the parton distribution functions are modified by the presence of the nuclear medium .    however , the description of nuclear collisions based on pqcd is a complicated task .",
    "much of the complication derives from the intrinsically complex nature of the nuclear environment in collisions of heavy nuclei .",
    "in addition to the initial - state modification of the pdfs , the cross section of high-@xmath4 hadron production is influenced by final - state effects ( such as jet energy loss ) and a complicated geometry .",
    "to better understand the physics of pqcd in the nuclear environment , it is highly desirable to disentangle the different nuclear phenomena affecting high-@xmath4 ( @xmath5 gev / c ) hadron production .",
    "these phenomena ( not present in proton - proton collisions ) manifest themselves in e.g. the measured nuclear modification factors .",
    "deuteron - gold ( d+au ) collisions provide a good compromise and testing ground for these purposes .",
    "the deuteron , being the simplest `` real '' nucleus , affords a complexity higher than a proton , but much less than that of a typical heavy nucleus like gold .",
    "thus , a good understanding of d+au collisions is invaluable in elucidating the added complexity associated with collisions of more complex heavy nuclei .",
    "accordingly , d+au collisions have been extensively studied at rhic ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a new feature , offered by nonidentical colliding beams like d+au , is the pseudorapidity asymmetry , examined in some detail recently by the star collaboration@xcite .",
    "any pqcd calculation involves , in addition to partonic differential cross sections , parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and fragmentation functions ( ffs ) to connect to the observable level .",
    "the latter ingredients are non - perturbative , but universal in the absence of the nuclear environment .",
    "typical pqcd - based calculations of nucleus - nucleus collisions use modified ( nuclear ) pdfs and deal with issues like jet energy loss ( jet quenching ) and collision geometry . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the pdfs ( and of course can not avoid treating the geometry of the collision ) . even in the proton ( nucleon )",
    ", our knowledge of the pdfs is naturally limited ; the npdfs are much less well known in the wide range of momentum fraction  @xmath6 needed for reliable calculations . the nuclear gluon distribution , in particular ,",
    "is poorly constrained .",
    "the uncertainties in the npdfs directly affect the accuracy of pqcd calculations .",
    "it is therefore important not to rely on a single npdf parametrization .",
    "calculations utilizing different parameterizations offer a useful check on the performances of the different npdfs in describing relevant observables .    in the present work",
    "we compute nuclear modifications expressed in terms of the ratios @xmath0 ( nuclear modification factor , see eq .",
    "( [ rdau ] ) ) and @xmath1 ( central - to - peripheral ratio , see eq .",
    "( [ rcp ] ) ) .",
    "we also calculate the pseudorapidity asymmetry @xmath2 ( see eq .",
    "( [ yasym ] ) ) in certain pseudorapidity intervals .",
    "we focus attention on the phenomenon of nuclear shadowing , the difference between pdfs and npdfs , leaving aside possible additional effects like jet quenching or intrinsic parton transverse momentum and its broadening in nuclear collisions . in this way",
    "we establish a minimalist base line for experimental comparisons .",
    "an earlier study along these lines  @xcite used the eskola - kolhinen - salgado ( eks)@xcite and frankfurt - guzey - strikman ( fgs)@xcite parameterizations of nuclear shadowing . in refs .",
    "@xcite the basic object is the shadowing function , which encodes the relevant nuclear information .",
    "the npdfs are then a product of the shadowing function and nucleon pdfs . in our present study",
    "we are particularly interested in the hirai - kumano - nagai ( hkn ) parameterization  @xcite , which also gives the parton distribution functions for the deuteron , unlike other parameterizations in which the deuteron is not shadowed .",
    "( deuteron shadowing is of course a small effect compared to shadowing in heavy nuclei . )",
    "a short review of the available nuclear parton distribution functions and their differences can be found in ref .",
    "another point of departure in the present study from ref .",
    "@xcite is the use here of the albino - kramer - kniehl ( akk ) fragmentation functions  @xcite .",
    "these updated fragmentation functions are only available in next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and incorporate new experimental information from the opal collaboration , including light quark tagging probabilities@xcite . thus akk is expected to offer a better description of the fragmentation process . for calculations involving the eks and fgs shadowing functions",
    "we need the nucleon parton distributions .",
    "we use the mrst2001 leading order ( lo ) pdfs@xcite for consistency with hkn , where the underlying nucleon pdfs are the mrst2001 lo pdfs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ formalism ] we review the basic formalism of lo pqcd as applied to d+au collisions .",
    "this section also includes the definitions of the nuclear modification factor , the central - to - peripheral ratio , and the pseudorapidity asymmetry , and a brief review of the available experimental data .",

    "[ intro ] , it is natural to assume that the npdf depends on the location of the parton in the nucleus , ( @xmath29 ( or at least on its position relative to the beam axis @xmath30 ) . to connect this `` inhomogeneous '' npdf to the geometry - independent ( homogeneous ) npdf @xmath31",

    "the hkn parameterization is already given in terms of npdfs .    especially at small values of @xmath6 ,",
    "where coherence effects are important , scaling with the thickness function appears to be more physical than with the local density .",
    "therefore , in this work we assume that shadowing is proportional to the thickness function ( [ eq : tf ] ) ( i.e. we adopt the second option discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    the connection between the inhomogeneous and homogeneous shadowing functions , @xmath37 and @xmath32 ,",
    "respectively , can be written as s_a(x , q^2,,z ) = 1 + n [ s(x , q^2 ) - 1 ] , with @xmath38 a normalization constant .",
    "in other words , the deviation of the inhomogeneous shadowing function from unity is proportional to the deviation from unity of the homogeneous shadowing function and proportional to the thickness function .",
    "while inhomogeneous fgs npdfs are available , for consistency and ease of comparison with eks and hkn , we apply the homogeneous fgs npdfs .",
    "we obtain the density distribution of the deuteron from the hulthen wave function@xcite ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , while a woods - saxon density distribution is used for gold with parameters from ref .  @xcite .",
    "since the nijmegen deuteron wave function@xcite , which we also applied , gives similar results to the hulthen wave function , we report only the calculations using the hulthen wave function here .",
    "we fix the scales as @xmath39 , where @xmath4 is the final hadronic transverse momentum .",
    "we also carried out calculations with the scales @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "results with the latter choice do not differ significantly from those obtained by having both scales fixed at @xmath4 .",
    "the partonic differential cross sections , @xmath20 were evaluated at leading order ( lo ) .",
    "we note that , if a @xmath42 factor was used to approximate the effects of higher orders , these effects would cancel in the ratios calculated in the present study . for the fragmentation functions we use the akk set@xcite throughout .      the d+au nuclear modification factor ,",
    "@xmath0 is defined as @xmath43 where the average number of binary collisions , @xmath44 in the various impact - parameter bins is given by @xmath45 here @xmath46 is the inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section , and t_dau(b ) = d^2s  t_d(s )  t_au(|b- s| ) represents the deuteron - gold nuclear overlap function .",
    "the nuclear modification factor @xmath0 is thus just the ratio of the d+au and proton - proton ( pp ) cross sections , normalized by the average number of binary collisions ,  @xmath44 .",
    "a related ratio , which dispenses with the need for a reference pp cross section and uses information from the same experiment in numerator and denominator , thus canceling most systematic errors , is the central to peripheral ratio defined as @xmath47 where @xmath44 is as defined above . the label @xmath48 stands for the central event class , while @xmath49 denotes the peripheral class .",
    "the centrality classes are chosen according to centrality cuts on the experimental data .",

    "the akk fragmentation functions are for average charged hadrons .",
    "it should be remembered that the calculated results for all rapidities are therefore for the average of charged hadrons .",
    "furthermore , the brahms data are given in three centrality classes : central ( 0 - 20)% , semicentral ( 30 - 50)% , and peripheral ( 60 - 80)% ( as a percentile of the geometric cross section ) . with a woods - saxon density for gold and the hulthen wave function for the deuteron",

    "we will use the notation @xmath1 to refer to the central - to - peripheral ratio , while @xmath59 will be used to denote the semicentral - to - peripheral ratio in the following .      as the mechanisms for hadron production in d+au collisions may be different at forward rapidities ( deuteron side ) and backward rapidities ( gold side ) , it is of interest to study ratios of particle yields between a given rapidity value and its negative in these collisions .",
    "the star collaboration has recently measured pseudorapidity asymmetries@xcite , defined as y_asym = ( ) / ( ) .",
    ", [ yasym ] in d+au collisions for several identified hadron species and total charged hadrons in the pseudorapidity intervals @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "rapidity asymmetries with the backward / forward ratio above unity for transverse momenta up to @xmath62 gev / c are observed for charged pion , proton+anti - proton , and total charged hadron production in both rapidity regions .",
    "we want to see if different npdfs give significantly different rapidity asymmetries for the various hadron species .",
    "before presenting the results from the three different npdfs , we note that while eks and hkn are similar in the sense that they are global fits to experimental data , fgs is relying on gribov theory for diffractive deep inelastic scattering to derive npdfs .",
    "gluon shadowing is much stronger in fgs than in eks and hkn .",
    "because nuclear gluon distributions are poorly constrained experimentally , there are significant differences between the eks and hkn gluon shadowing .",
    "on the other hand , since the gribov formalism is not capable to predict valence quark shadowing , fgs uses eks shadowing for valence quarks , and all three parameterizations are in agreement for valence quark shadowing . for sea quarks , eks and hkn",
    "are in good agreement at @xmath63 . at @xmath64 and",
    "in the small-@xmath6 region @xmath65 there are substantial deviations .",
    "the fgs predicts more nuclear shadowing for sea quarks than eks and hkn . due to the @xmath6-integration ,",
    "different nuclear effects [ shadowing ( @xmath66 , depletion ) , antishadowing ( @xmath67 , enhancement ) , emc effect ( @xmath68 , depletion ) , etc ] are superimposed , thus it is difficult to isolate these effects .",
    "since pqcd calculations are generally not reliable at low @xmath4 , we do not wish to push our calculations below @xmath69 gev / c . with our scale choice",
    ", this corresponds to a minimum @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) of @xmath72 gev@xmath73 , while eks , fgs , and hkn give @xmath74 , and @xmath75 gev@xmath73 for minimum @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "the minimum @xmath71 for the akk fragmentation functions is given as @xmath76 gev@xmath73 .",
    "we have calculated the minimum bias @xmath0 for total charged hadron production at the brahms pseudorapidities with the three nuclear parton distribution functions considered in this study . in the case of the fgs npdfs",
    "we use the strong gluon shadowing for the gold nucleus .",
    "we have only calculated the @xmath77 distributions for final - state total charged hadrons in the present study , since we are mainly interested in the performance of the different npdfs . more detail for different hadron species and fractional contributions from quarks , antiquarks , and gluons for eks and fgs npdfs",
    "can be found in @xcite .",
    "here we limit our discussion of nuclear modification factors to the effect of the different npdfs .",
    "we make two general observations :    1 .   at midrapidity ( small @xmath8 ) , processes initiated by both gluons and quarks are important . at forward rapidities ( large @xmath8 ) , @xmath78 , the parton momentum fraction in gold becomes small and gluon - initiated processes become dominant .",

    "the fgs describes the data best while at high @xmath4 it is similar to the eks .",

    "both @xmath1 and @xmath59 are geometry - dependent , thus the assumed spatial dependence of shadowing is important . we have checked that shadowing proportional to the local density gives worse agreement with data than shadowing proportional to the thickness function .",
    "a variation of the thickness function dependence where we used higher powers gives better agreement at @xmath79 but still overpredicts significantly at other rapidities . with these shadowing parameterizations ,",
    "a more radical spatial dependence is needed to describe the data for both ratios .",
    "another factor that may be responsible is a too - weak @xmath6-dependence of the available shadowing parameterizations .      in d+au collisions at small rapidities ,",
    "particle production may include contributions from gold - side partons that may have been modified by nuclear effects and from deuteron - side partons that have experienced multiple scatterings while traversing the gold nucleus @xcite .",
