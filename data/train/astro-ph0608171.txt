    "over the last few years , the study of high redshift qsos has been revolutionized in three ways .",
    "first , wide field surveys have revealed 100 s of high@xmath2 qsos , right back to the epoch of cosmic reionization ( @xmath3 ; e.g. , fan et al . 2006 ) .",
    "second , it has been shown that most ( all ? ) low redshift spheroidal galaxies have central super - massive black holes ( smbh ) , and that the black hole mass correlates with bulge velocity dispersion .",
    "this m@xmath4@xmath5 correlation suggests coeval formation of galaxies and smbh , thereby making smbhs a fundamental aspect of the galaxy formation process ( gebhardt et al . 2000 ) . and",
    "third , mm surveys of high redshift qsos find that 30@xmath6 of the sources are ` hyper - luminous infrared galaxies ' ( @xmath7 l@xmath8 ) , corresponding to thermal emission from warm dust , and that this fraction is _ independent of redshift out to @xmath9 _",
    "( beelen et al .",
    "2004 , omont et al . 2004 ) .",
    "if the dust is heated by star formation , the implied star formation rates are extreme ( @xmath10 m@xmath8 year@xmath11 ) , consistent with the formation of a large elliptical galaxy on a dynamical timescale of 10@xmath12 years . +",
    "molecular line observations ( typically co ) of fir - luminous high@xmath2 qsos have revealed large gas masses in most cases observed to date ( see carilli et al .  2004 ; solomon & vanden bout 2005 ) . detecting large amounts of warm ,",
    "extended molecular gas currently provides the strongest evidence that these luminous qsos are undergoing vigorous star formation .",
    "the coeval growth of massive black holes and of massive stellar populations can be examined directly in these unique systems , providing an opportunity to study the cause of the tight correlation between these components that is observed in local spheroidal galaxies .",
    "high resolution observations are crucial for this , since the structure of the dense gas which is feeding the starburst and the black hole can reveal the cause of event ( e.g. mergers ) and the mass of the systems , placing them into the cosmic structure evolution context . molecular gas has now been detected in more than a dozen @xmath13 qso host galaxies .",
    "most sources have been studied in the higher order transitions ( @xmath14 co 32 ) , although at @xmath15 the lower order transitions become accessible to cm telescopes such as the vla .",
    "the _ detection _ of co emission is critical to estimate the reservoir of the molecular gas in these early systems .",
    "a second step is then to _ spatially resolve the molecular gas distribution_. in particular , given the typical diameters of galaxies of many kpc , a linear resolution of @xmath16kpc is needed to _ resolve the structure _ of the underlying host galaxy .",
    "such measurements are needed 1 ) to get an estimate for the _ size of the host galaxy _ ( and thus a better estimate for the dynamical mass ) , 2 ) to resolve potentially merging systems and 3 ) to better constrain the _ physical properties _ of the molecular gas by measuring the brightness temperature of the molecular gas in the hosts .",
    "a linear resolution of 1kpc corresponds to a resolution of 0.15@xmath0 at the redshifts under consideration ( 1@xmath17kpc at @xmath18 , 1@xmath19kpc at @xmath20 ) .",
    "such observations can then in turn be used to constrain the predictions by cdm simulations of early galaxy formation , and , if a large sample was available , put limits on the frequency of mergers at high redshift .",
    "in addition , such studies can be used to constrain the possible redshift - evolution of the m@xmath21@xmath5 relation ( as will be discussed below ) .     resolution .",
    "the crosses show the positions of the optical qsos , and the cross sizes represent the relative astrometric error .",
    "the contour levels are a geometric progression in square root 2 starting at 0.12 mjy beam@xmath11.,width=283 ]    it is important to note that the highest resolution imaging of qso host galaxies can currently only be obtained using the recently upgraded q  band system at the vla . in optical / nir observations",
    "the central bright agn greatly overshines the host galaxy , thus rendering optical / nir studies of the qso hosts impossible given current instrumentations .",
    "we note that observations of the molecular gas phase at resolutions of 0.15@xmath0 will even be difficult to achieve with alma during the early science operations , as they require @xmath14 km ( @xmath22ghz ) or @xmath23 km ( @xmath24ghz ) baselines ( numbers are for a @xmath25 source ) . for comparison ,",

    "over the last few years , the vla has been used to image a number of high@xmath2 sources . in the following",
    ", we will briefly review some of these observations and their implications for understanding the properties of molecular gas at the highest redshifts .",
    "* j2322 + 1944 ( @xmath27 ) : * in fig .  1 we show the co emission from the @xmath28 qso j2322 + 1944 .",
    "the source is strongly gravitationally lensed , appearing as a double qso in the optical with 1@xmath0 separation ( djorgovski et al .  in prep ) , and a complete einstein ring in the co 2 - 1 emission ( carilli et al .",
    "this molecular ring makes j2322 + 1944 one of the most stunning co images at high redshift .",
    "quite importantly , a similar ring is seen for the 1.4 ghz continuum emission ( carilli et al .",
    "these observations have been modeled ( by the above mentioned authors ) in the source plane as a starburst disk surrounding the qso with a radius of about 2 kpc .",
    "j2322 + 1944 thus represents perhaps _ the best example of a coeval starburst+agn _ at high redshift .",
    "this exemplifies that strongly lensed sources can be used to even study the overall morphologies in galaxies ( if a good lens model exists ) .    ) .",
    "contours are shown at -2 , -1.4 , 1.4 , 2 , 2.8 , and 4 @xmath29 ( 1@xmath30 = 43 @xmath31jy beam@xmath11 ) . the beam size ( 0.35@xmath0 @xmath32 0.30@xmath0 )",

    "this high  resolution map recovers half of the flux seen in the left panel ( see walter et al .",
    "2004 for more details ) .",
    "new hst acs imaging suggests that the agn seen in the optical is associated with the souther co clump seen in the right panel ( white et al .",

    "it was detected in multiple co transitions and recently also in co(10 ) using the gbt ( see riechers et al .",
    "2006 , also this volume ) .",
    "this source has the curious property that the optical qso is a single source , but the mm continuum and co line observations show a double source with a separation of about 4@xmath0 ( omont et al .",
    "1996 ; guilloteau et al.1999 ; carilli et al .",
    "this is illustrated in the co imaging shown in fig .",
    "2 . this double morphology may indicate a pair of interacting objects separated by about only 20kpc ( yun et al .",
    "2000 ) or a qso exhibiting a massive starburst ( southern source ) with a dust  obscured , ly@xmath35 - emitting companion ( northern source , hu et al .",
    "1996 ) ionized by the strong qso , which also contains a starburst . the total far - ir luminosity of the ulirg br1202 - 0725 is @xmath36 , leading to a @xmath37 ratio of 350 .",
    "the implied total molecular gas mass in this system is about @xmath38 ( carilli et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "* j1148 + 5251 ( @xmath39 ) : * this source is still the redshift record  holder for qsos .",
    "it has been detected in co(3 - 2 ) using the vla ( walter et al .",
    "2003 ) and in co(65 ) and co(76 ) using the plateau de bure interferomter ( bertoldi et al .",
    "follow  up",
    "vla b and c array observations clearly resolved the the molecular distribution spatially and also in velocity space ( walter et al .",
    "2004 , see fig .  3 ) . the molecular gas distribution in j1148 + 5251",
    "is extended out to radii of 2.5kpc .",
    "the central region is resolved and shows 2 peaks , separated by 1.7kpc ; they account for about half of the total emission , with the other half present in the more extended molecular gas distribution .",
    "each of these peaks harbors a molecular gas mass of @xmath40m@xmath41 within a radius of 0.5kpc , respectively ; this mass is similar to the total mass found in nearby ulirgs such as mrk273 or arp220 ( downes & solomon 1998 ) .",
    "the peaks have intrinsic brightnesses of @xmath42k ( averaged over the 1kpc - sized beam ) , similar to what is found in the centres of nearby active galaxies ( downes & solomon 1998 , assuming constant surface brightness down to the co(10 ) transition ) , albeit measured over a larger physical area .",
    "based on the extent of the molecular gas distribution and the line - width measured from the higher co transitions we derive a dynamical mass of @xmath43m@xmath41 ( @xmath44m@xmath41 if we correct for an inclination of @xmath45 ) .",
    "this dynamical mass estimate can account for the detected molecular gas mass within this radius but leaves little room for other matter .",
    "in particular , given a black hole mass of mass @xmath11 - 5@xmath46 m@xmath41 ( willot et al .",
    "2003 ) , this dynamical mass could not accomodate an order few@xmath47m@xmath41 stellar bulge which is predicted by the present ",
    "day m@xmath48 relation ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 , gebhardt 2000 ) , if this relation were to hold at these high redshifts .",
    "even if we assume a scenario in which this bulge was 10 times the scale length of the molecular gas emission , we would still expect a bulge contribution of few@xmath49m@xmath41 within the central 2.5kpc ( assuming a central density  profile of @xmath50 , e.g. , jaffe 1983 , tremaine 1994 ) which can not be reconciled with our results .",
    "our finding therefore suggests that black holes may assemble before the stellar bulges .",
    "depending on the space density of similar sources at these high redshifts , the smaller dynamical masses may be in better agreement with the masses predicted by cdm simulations in the very early universe as a 10@xmath51m@xmath41 bulge would imply a rather massive dark matter halo of @xmath52m@xmath41 .",
    "regardless , these results show the power of high - resolution co imaging in sources at the end of cosmic reionization .",

    "two clearly separated images can be seen , and their morphology and brightess ratio is very similar to that of the optical qso . we thus conclude that the co in this source is indeed extremely compact , and that the lensing magnification is close to the optical magnification i.e. , a factor of 100 rather than 7 as derived in previous models ( lewis et al .",
