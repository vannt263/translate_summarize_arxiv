    "entropy is an important concept not only for physics but also for information science . from the definition of entropy",
    ", we can get some simple properties of it , such as concavity , continuity property , additivity and subadditivity@xcite .",
    "but some other properties is not so obvious , such as the strong subadditivity theorem ( ssa ) . among all of the properties of entropy ,",
    "the most famous one is the ssa , and it is very difficult to prove this theorem for quantum system .",
    "the content of this theorem can be expressed as the following : two overlapping subsystem @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the entropy of their union ( @xmath2 ) plus the entropy of their intersection ( @xmath3 ) does not exceed the sum of the entropies of the subsystems ( @xmath0 and @xmath1)@xcite , that is @xmath4 where @xmath5 it is well known that this theorem is true for classical information theory , but to prove this theorem is true for quantum system is very difficult .",
    "this theorem is first conjectured to be true for the quantum system by lanford and robibson@xcite .",
    "the first proof of this conjecture is given by lieb _",
    "_ several years later .",
    "this proof is based on the concave of the function @xmath6 in @xmath7@xcite .",
    "another proof based on the same fact was proposed by uhlmann@xcite .",
    "recently , quantum information theory attracts more and more attentions for its misterious properties and its potential applications in science and technology@xcite .",
    "the ssa plays an important role in this new field@xcite too .",
    "the fundamental scource in quantum information is entanglement between many particles which can be viewed as the relations between the partial particles .",
    "so distinguish whether a set of the partial particles come from a single state ( @xmath8-representability problem)@xcite and further to obtain its entanglement property are important in quantum information while ssa gives a strong constraint on the partial particles and the whole system .",
    "the convenience of the ssa is that it has explicit physical and manipulating meaning .",
    "so it is a convenient necessary criterion for the @xmath8-representability problem .",
    "recently , we use the matrix analysis method@xcite to get some necessary conditions for the @xmath8-presentability problem .",
    "we find that using these conditions we can get a new proof for the ssa .",
    "our new proof is elementary , we need only to use the lagrange multiplier method and carefully analyse the minimum of a function .",
