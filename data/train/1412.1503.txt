    "<S> occur on a plateau , whose value is largely determined by the detuning noise . </S>",
    "<S> this is not the same conclusion reached in @xcite , where fidelity limits were attributed to nuclear noise . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that those experiments were performed at lower @xmath84 , below the plateau , where nuclear noise predominates . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that larger @xmath84 should be used to achieve maximal fidelities .    </S>",
    "<S> our most important results are obtained by comparing the maximal fidelities of @xmath87 and @xmath83 rotations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath2-rotations have maximum fidelities @xmath9420 times worse than @xmath1-rotations , which can be directly attributed to the fact that @xmath2-rotations occur away from the sweet spot , while @xmath1-rotations occur at the sweet spot . </S>",
    "<S> the degradation of @xmath2-rotations is most noticeable for large @xmath84 , where the fidelity is dominated by charge noise . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of the quantum dot hybrid qubit show a similar degradation of coherence away from a sweet spot  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that ac gating techniques could yield better fidelities than the dc pulsing techniques studied here , because the detuning is always centered at the sweet spot  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , recent experiments on the exchange - only qubit have employed such a strategy  @xcite . on the other hand , ac methods tend to produce somewhat slower gates , for which nuclear noise could be a problem .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that our analysis has focused on gaas quantum dot devices , where nuclear noise is known to be important . for si - based devices , especially isotopically purified @xmath35si </S>",
    "<S> , the nuclear noise can be very small . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , si devices should yield better fidelities for dc pulsed gates , especially in the low-@xmath84 regime . </S>",
    "<S> ( see @xcite . ) at higher @xmath84 , where nuclear noise is not predominant , si and gaas exchange - only qubits should have similar fidelities .    </S>",
