    "optical microvariability ( om ; variations with small amplitude in time scales from minutes to hours ) in quasars can be a powerful tool to constrain the energy emission models of active galactic nuclei .",
    "some studies indicate that om does not depend on the radio properties of quasars ( see @xcite , hereafter pi ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter pii ) .",
    "however , the mechanism responsible for om has not been characterized . concerning this topic ,",
    "variability studies in the optical bands acquired a particular relevance , because the optical / uv excess is identified with the emission from the accretion disk ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . unfortunately ,",
    "all the proposed scenarios are very complex when the emission from additional spectral components is considered .    in photometric studies , the properties of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of quasars era characterized by the spectral index , which is defined as the slope of a curve in a plane @xmath0 , and calculated as magnitude differences at different bands ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "during variability events , changes in the shape of this sed can give us important information about the emission processes .",
    "for instance , evidence from variability studies strongly indicates that om has non - thermal nature in both bl lac objects and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ; e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , but in the case of fsrqs the contribution of a thermal component must be considered in the spectrum of these objects ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "concerning quasars , short - term variability ( variations with amplitudes of tenths of a magnitude and time scales of weeks to months ) might have thermal origin ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , all these studies usually employ two bands , or only the average of color values is used , losing thus information about _ texture _ of shortest variations ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in order to discern where the om in quasars originates",
    ", we assume that emission from the accretion disk must be related to thermal processes , while the emission from the jet must be related to non - thermal processes . during om events , the spectral component responsible for the variation may display characteristic color changes .",
    "then , we developed a method with quasi - simultaneous observations at three optical bands to analyze these color changes that accompanied microvariability events .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ datos ] , we shortly comment on the data treatment ; in section  [ sed ] , we define a spectral variability index and how to determine the om origin ; in section  [ results ] , we analyze the data ; finally , we discuss the results in section  [ discusion ] ; while a summary and conclusions are given in section  [ summary ] .",
    "details of the selection criteria , observation strategy , and data reduction have been exposed in pi , pii , and @xcite .",
    "these data consist of a sample of 22 core - dominated radio - loud quasars ( crlq ) and 22 radio quiet quasars ( rqqs ) observed in diverse epochs . each object in the rqq sample paired a crlq object in brightness and redshift minimizing selection effects when properties of microvariability between both samples were compared in pii . here",
    ", we will only discuss the data corresponding to om events reported in pii .",
    "this subsample is listed in table [ log5 ] .",
    "four telescopes were used , which are located in mexico and spain .",
    "@xmath1 filters of johnson - cousins series were used .",
    "the observational strategy consists of monitoring a crlq - rqq couple during the same night in overlapping sequences ; five images of each object in the @xmath1 sequence are taken ( @xmath2 minute of exposure time per image , although it depends of the object brightness , the filters and the telescope used ) .",
    "each object was observed at moderated air masses , always at least @xmath3 above the horizon .",
    "standard stars were observed to obtain the flux level of the first data set of each objects in each night .",
    "these stars were observed each time that a sequence of each pair of objects was complete .",
    "this implies that standard stars were observed each hour , approximately .",
    "all these stars are taken from @xcite .",
    "in addition , these standard stars are used to perform correction by atmospheric extinction .",
    "in order to discern where the om originates , the analysis is divided into two main steps : first , a sed model is fitted to the _ initial _ data set , obtaining estimations of the values of the parameters of each spectral component ; then , the observed spectral variations are modeled using these values .",
    "the simplest description of the continuum emission for quasars is given by a thermal and non - thermal emission mixture ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , at any time @xmath4 , the flux would be determined by the expression @xmath5 where the sub - index @xmath4 refers to the time when a particular data set was acquired ; @xmath6 refers to the total flux ; @xmath7 to its non - thermal component ; and @xmath8 to its thermal component ( hereafter sub - indices @xmath9 and @xmath10 indicate thermal and non - thermal components , respectively ) .",
    "usually , thermal and non - thermal components are associated with the accretion disk and with the relativistic jet , respectively .",
    "hereafter , we will adopt this assumption .    at any time @xmath4",
    ", the contribution from each component to the total flux can be described as @xmath11 for the non - thermal component , and @xmath12 for the thermal one ( note that @xmath13 ) .    in a naive description",
    ", the non - thermal emission from the jet can be described by a simple power law , while the thermal emission from the disk can be modeled by a simple blackbody .",
    "although a simple blackbody is an over - simplification for the accretion disk , this is the simplest model that fits our data ( something similar has been made previously by @xcite ; @xcite ; among others ) .    when a given object is monitored in a particular night , we can determine an initial time , @xmath14 , which corresponds to the first data set of observations .",
    "when a variation is detected we take the difference of fluxes between a given data set obtained at the time @xmath4 , and that for the first data set ; then , we normalize with respect to the initial total flux .",
    "we consider that the variation is provoked by only one of the spectral components in expression ( [ ec5.1 ] ) , leading to the fact that in the difference of fluxes only the variable component survives , i.e. , @xmath15 in this expression , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) represents the variable component",
    ". some advantages ( which are easy to verify ) of measuring the flux changes by this expression are : data transformation to standard photometric system is unnecessary ; error propagation is diminished , and a larger accuracy is reached ; correction by interstellar extinction and cosmological assumptions ( as the ones required in order to give a value for @xmath18 ) are also avoided .",
    "it is important to stress that , when we fitted the model to the initial data set , it is necessary to correct for interstellar extinction to the first @xmath1 data set ; while for the spectral variability description , this correction is not required .    on the other hand",
    ", we have to consider that the observed flux is related to the emission in the sources frame through the expression @xmath19)/ 4 \\pi d^2 _ l$ ] ( see @xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath20 represents the observed flux at the observed frequency @xmath21 ; @xmath22 the luminosity of the source ; @xmath23 the redshift ; and @xmath24 the luminosity distance .",
    "in addition , we can represent the brightness amplitude of each component by means of a pair of constants : @xmath25 for the non - thermal component and @xmath26 for the thermal one .",
    "the injection of new particles with similar energy , for the non - thermal case , or changes of size of the region of emission , for the thermal case , can provoke amplitude changes .",
    "we initially fit the observed flux at the first data set , obtaining the initial values for the temperature of the disk , the spectral index of the non - thermal component , and the contribution of each component : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively . taking the initial data",
    ", we can express for the non - thermal component the ratio of fluxes between any @xmath4 and @xmath14 , i.e. , @xmath31 from this expression we obtain @xmath32 where @xmath33 refers to the magnitude in the standard system , corrected by interstellar extinction ( corrections to these initial magnitudes were carried out using values reported by the ned ) ; @xmath20 is a constant of reference flux , corresponding to a star of zero magnitude ; and @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , i.e. , the effective frequency in the @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 bands .",

    "changes in amplitude are easily obtained by varying the values of these ratios from unity , at @xmath14 , to their final values at @xmath4 .",
    "once we get @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , changes of @xmath52 and/or @xmath53 , or @xmath54 and/or @xmath55 , in expression ( [ ec5.2 ] ) , generate the trajectories in the @xmath56 plane ( see figures [ pks15vardos]-[pks15z ] ) .",
    "simultaneous changes in @xmath52 and @xmath57 , or @xmath54 and @xmath58 can generate diagnosis trajectories with a returning behavior ( see figure [ pks15vardos ] ) .",
    "a similar case can happen in an expansion of the thermal component with a decrease in its temperature .",
    "unfortunately , for the data presented in pii it is not possible to establish a unique set of initial parameters , due to the lack of data in more bands .",
    "figure [ pks15dos ] shows this problem . in this figure , we present three reasonable fits for disk temperatures of @xmath59 k , @xmath60 k and @xmath61 k for the first data set of pks  1510 - 089 .",
    "for this reason , we must select the most appropriate values for @xmath28 , @xmath27 , and @xmath29 , based on the typical values found in the literature for similar objects .",
    "some investigations suggest that the typical maximum disk temperature , close to the central object , should be between @xmath60 k and @xmath61 k , although temperatures outside of this range are not discarded ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the spectral index of the non - thermal component might be around @xmath62 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand , for blazars , the non - thermal component contributes with most of the flux ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and at low brightness levels , it is expected that both components contribute the same ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , regardless the exact value for these parameters at @xmath46 , we can discern the om origin analyzing the spectral variations .",
    "the procedure consists of taking several @xmath27-@xmath28-@xmath41 sets , trying to reproduce the spectral variations with each of them .",
    "first , the simplest component ( a power law ) is fitted to the initial data , obtaining @xmath28 . from this fit , we look for an explanation to the spectral variation , i.e. , performing changes of amplitude , of the slope , or both , in the diagnosis plane . if the explanation is satisfactory , for simplicity we consider that the om event is consistent with changes in this unique component .",
    "otherwise , an extra ( thermal ) component must be added to fit the initial data .",
    "when this second ( thermal ) component is added to fit the data , two families of characterization curves are generated : one for thermal variations ( as those showed in figure [ pks15vardos ] ) and one for non - thermal variations ( as those showed in figure [ pks15alfas ] ) .",
    "contrasting the data with each family of curves , we can determine whether a spectral variation is consistent with a change in the thermal component ( i.e. , changes of @xmath52 and/or @xmath63 ) or in the non - thermal one ( i.e. , changes of @xmath54 and/or @xmath64 ) .    after comparing the data with all the curves , we find that we can set the initial spectral index of the non - thermal component , @xmath28 , at @xmath65 , * without affecting our conclusions .",
    "so , when we include the thermal component , we have only @xmath27 and @xmath41 as free parameters . *",
    "then , we take this fit as representative of each family of curves , as shown in figures 7 . for this reason , the estimations for the values of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath41 must be considered more as a suggestion than as the actual conditions for both disk and jet .",
    "we have explored how these assumptions can affect the discernment of the om origin . as it can be appreciated in figures [ pks15vardos]-[pks15z ] , depending on their origin ,",
    "the curves show a different behavior . with different assumptions of values of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath41 , the trajectories for non - thermal variations are very similar . for this reason ,",
    "we believe that the choice of @xmath66 has no influence on the description of the spectral variation . expression ( [ ec5.16 ] ) shows , in fact , that @xmath41 , @xmath67 , and @xmath64 have more influence on the behavior of the trajectories than @xmath28 .",
    "additionally , it is easy to see from expression ( [ ec5.16 ] ) that considering another power law as the second component , instead of a thermal one , does not allow us to reproduce the observed variability .    to illustrate this procedure , we have taken the case of pks  1510 - 089 .",
    "first , a unique non - thermal component has been fitted to the initial data . since this fit",
    "does not describe accurately the variation , it is necessary to add the thermal emission from the disk ( figure [ pks15dos ] ) .",
    "we then fixed @xmath28 at @xmath62 and calculated the corresponding value for @xmath27 for different choices of @xmath41 .",
    "then , we analyzed the variations of the thermal component ( see figure [ pks15vardos ] ) .",
    "we have used @xmath68 k ( although we also explored the cases with @xmath60 k and @xmath61 k , solid thin lines in figure [ pks15dos ] ) and a non - thermal component contribution of @xmath69 .",
    "afterward , @xmath28 was fixed at different values , and the corresponding values for @xmath27 and @xmath41 were calculated .",
    "figures [ pks15alfas ] and [ pks15tes ] show spectral variability curves for changes of the non - thermal and thermal component , respectively .",
    "curves correspond to @xmath70 .",
    "as it can be observed in figure [ pks15alfas ] for a variation of the non - thermal component , the range of values used for the parameters has poor influence on the behavior of the spectral variations .",
    "on the other hand , the data have a behavior that is closer to the one expected from thermal changes ( figure [ pks15tes ] ) .    following a different approach ,",
    "@xmath41 was fixed at different values ( @xmath71 ) , and the corresponding values for @xmath27 and @xmath28 were calculated .",
    "figure [ pks15a0 ] shows different curves for similar changes in @xmath52 and @xmath72 , and for clarity in the figure , we have included only a curve for changes in @xmath54 and @xmath73 , since the other curves are similar ( as those shown in figure [ pks15a0 ] ) .",
    "again , the spectral variation has a behavior that corresponds more to what is expected from thermal variations .",
    "finally , we have explored the effect of redshift on variations ( figure [ pks15z ] ) . at the same values of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath41 , the same variation produced at different redshifts ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) causes different observable magnitude changes ; but with greater effect on thermal changes than on non - thermal ones .    from this exploration",
    ", we find that variations of the non - thermal component can not explain the data ; while these are consistent with thermal variations .",
    "in such a case , the temperature of the thermal component varies at least @xmath76 k for the best fit .    in summary , in the case of pks  1510 - 089 ,",
    "a change of the thermal component is the most plausible explanation for the observed variation , regardless of the exact values for @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath77 .",
    "a similar procedure has been carried out for each object reported as variable in pii . in the next section we present the results for each object .      a problem that has to be solved when dealing with color studies refers to the time delay between optical bands ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . for spectral om studies",
    ", it is particularly important to avoid any possibility of a time lag , because a shorter lag than the image acquisition time between bands could provoke a false spectral variation .",
    "thus , we must observe an object at different bands in sequences that reasonably guarantee an interval duration less than the physical lags .",
    "for the blazar 0716 + 714 , @xcite found that a complete sequence between the @xmath38 and @xmath78 bands should not exceed @xmath79 minutes .",
    "@xcite calculated a @xmath80 hrs time lag between @xmath37 and @xmath78 bands in most cases . on the other hand , @xcite established a time lag of @xmath81 minutes between the _ batc _ _ e _ and _ m _ bands .",
    "nevertheless there is little knowledge about the minimum temporary scales for microvariability .",
    "so , it is necessary a criterion for maximum acquisition time that help us to verify that , during a variation , each @xmath1 sequence was make at the same level of flux . usually , time lag could be determined by the discrete correlation function ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , but for our observational strategy , we developed a time - lag criterion based on the change rate of each om event .",
    "this criterion permits to be relatively sure that the data sets were acquired when each object was at the same flux level .",
    "we introduce a _",
    "criterion that relates the rate of brightness change with the time of acquisition .",
    "a _ simultaneity _",
    "index is defined by the expression @xmath82 where @xmath83 refers to the maximum variation amplitude ; @xmath84 refers to the time lasted between the observations to obtain @xmath83 ; @xmath85 is the required time to take a complete sequence of @xmath1 images ; and @xmath86 is the standard error in each group of five images .",
    "then , it will be considered that a @xmath1 set of observations is simultaneous when a magnitude difference larger than @xmath87 is avoided , i.e. , when the measured error is smaller than a marginal variation .",
    "thus , a set of images taken at the time @xmath4 is simultaneous when each @xmath88 .",
    "as this criterion is applied on each sequence of observations for an object in each night , we have an average @xmath89 for the total group of observations .",
    "we will show this average in the discussion for each object when none of the @xmath90 is greater than @xmath91 .",
    "in other case , each @xmath90 will be showed separately .",
    "although this criterion requires that the variations have constant change rates , in the next analysis we will see that it is possible to make this assumption , fulfilling this condition .",
    "the results presented in this section show that it is feasible to distinguish qualitatively between thermal and non - thermal origin of some microvariation events . in those cases where both components can explain the spectral variation , for simplicity we suppose that the unique non - thermal component is responsible for the variation . this ambiguity may be eliminated by increasing the monitoring time and observing more optical bands .",

    "from nine om detections reported in pii ( the two possible variations are excluded ) , our method can determine that three events are consistent with a thermal variation , and three with a non - thermal origin .",

    "the results presented in section  [ results ] show that microvariability does not depend on radio properties of quasars .",
    "moreover , our study shows that om related to non - thermal processes might be detectable not only in radio - loud quasars ( rlq ) ( e.g. , 3c  281/2000/mar/04 ) but also in rqq ( e.g. , mrk  830/2001/aug/18 ) , and that om related to thermal processes might be detected in both kinds of objects , rqq ( e.g. , 1628.5 + 3808 ) and rlq ( e.g. , pks  1510 - 08 ) .",
    "there are several explanations to account for spectral variability originating either in the jet or the accretion disk . on the one hand ,",
    "microvariability can be explained by the jet because of its physical conditions , and because time scales of om coincide with jet dynamics ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . if all quasars can generate a relativistic jet , as suggested by the observational reports",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , it is not surprising to find the manifestation of non - thermal microvariability in rqq .",
    "however , in the case of a jet , brightness temperatures exceeding the critical temperature , @xmath226 k , are required ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , and references therein ; @xcite ) . although this problem may be overcome if large doppler factors are considered ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the correlation between bands represents an additional problem for the jet thesis , because correlated variations between optic / uv and higher frequencies should be observed ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which is not the general rule ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    on the other hand , variations of diverse time scales , including om , can be produced in accretion disks ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; see also @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . some of these variations may be associated with disk dynamics , or time scales associated with thermal and sound crossing time phenomena ( minutes and hours ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "changes in the accretion rate can modify the temperature of the disk , altering the flux level and producing short - term variations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "perturbations on the accretion disk can also produce variations with time scales of weeks , days , and even hours ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite have suggested that whether the om is produced by processes related to the jet , then it is expected a smaller fwhm of the emission lines in quasars with positive detection than in those without om detection .",
    "these author found no such behavior .",
    "additionally , @xcite have reported that the microvariability detected in radio intermediate quasars has a duty cycle similar to that detected in rqqs and rlqs by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "all these results suggest that variations involving the accretion disk play an important role .",
    "@xcite developed a method to analyze the color changes in variability events .",
    "they determined that short - term variations in quasars may be originated by thermal processes related to changes in accretion rate , and hotspots in the accretion disk ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the same conclusion was obtained by @xcite for variability of quasars and seyfert galaxies . however , although periodic or quasi - periodic variations are attributed to circling and auto - occulted hotspots in the disk ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , most variations do not display this characteristic .",
    "nevertheless , non - periodicity might result of combination of hotspots and geometric changes , such as if the orbits in the disk are not keplerian ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , the contribution of each component to the total flux would play an important role to describe the spectral variations ( @xcite and @xcite arrived at a similar conclusion ) .",
    "we need two components to explain several spectral variations .",
    "in addition , when data are fitted exclusively with a non - thermal component , we have several cases where @xmath115 ( 3c  281 , pks  003 + 15 , mc3  1750 + 175 , us  3472 ) .",
    "since such a behavior is strange for the average sed of quasars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , this result supports the idea that in general a better fit is obtained when a second component is added .",
    "cases like those of pks  1510 - 089 indicate that the largest changes of color are due to thermal variations .",
    "if a disk - jet relationship exists ( e.g. , @xcite ) , more complex variations can be produced by perturbations in the disk that are propagated to the jet ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , our results are in agreement with @xcite , who reported that bl lac objects do not show spectral variability as large as quasars , for which the thermal component contribution is larger",
    ".    our description of the disk emission by a single blackbody may be inadequate to explain observations ; however , more complicated models still produce unsatisfactory explanations even for the simplest variations .",
    "for example , the standard accretion disk model predicts time lags between optical bands ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) , that are not always observed .",
    "because for spectral microvariability , variable and non - variable components should be considered , some spectral components that have not been considered by our model can change the value of @xmath41 .",
    "these additional components can generate spectral variations not contemplated in our model ; for instance , the contribution from a line in only one of the three bands ( maybe , this can give an explanation to variations as those of 3c  281 ( 2000 march 4 ) , pks  0003 + 15 , and mc3  1750 + 175 ) .    in blazars , there are evidences that the spectral variations are larger for low flux levels ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this can be understood if at low flux level the thermal and non - thermal components have a comparable contribution to the optical flux ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for bl lacertae",
    ", some om events have been detected in which the object turned bluer when it increases its brightness ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these variations should be generated by a non - thermal component ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectral changes in fsrq seem to be larger than in bl lac objects , because the latter have not a remarkable contribution from the thermal component ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "then , a difference between the two blazars types may arise : the thermal component and its influence on spectral changes .",
    "the time - lag criterion that we developed is based on the change rate of each om event for our observational strategy .",
    "although this criterion permits to be relatively sure that the data sets were acquired at the same flux level , it requires that the variations have constant change rates .",
    "it should be noticed that the light curves with a _ jump _ , as that of pks  1510 - 089 reported in pii , can be in fact the result of continuum and gradual variations that show such jump because the observational strategy .",
    "the odd spectral variations observed in pks  0003 + 15 , mc3  1750 + 175 , and us  3472 might be caused by the violation of the simultaneity criterion .",
    "the emission from additional components would also have unexpected repercussions on the color changes .",
    "the importance of orientation on variations originated in the jet is not discarded , but processes such as those taking place in the disk should be considered . thermal component becomes indispensable to generate the observed variations , even in blazars ( particularly at low activity ) , because the accretion disk in these objects must be face - on .",
    "although variations presented in section  [ results ] were classified as microvariability , we can not rule out that they can be part of a variation of a trend with a larger characteristic time .",
    "for example , an alteration in the temperature of the accretion disk can show a variation with time scales of days , or even hours , which might presents a trend that we can observe during one night , and interpreted it as microvariability .",
    "the optical microvariations in rqq and rlq reported by @xcite were analyzed to determine whether their origin is thermal or non - thermal .",
    "we suppose that while thermal variations are related to the accretion disk , non - thermal variations are related to the relativistic jet .    with such a purpose , we developed a method to discriminate between color changes by thermal and non - thermal processes in quasars during an om event .",
    "this method consists in modeling the optical broadband continuum of quasars considering thermal and non - thermal components , and comparing the observed color changes with spectral variations derived from this model .",
    "the main result of this work is the possibility to distinguish between thermal and non - thermal origin of an optical microvariation event in quasars .",
    "we identified that some events are consistent with a thermal origin , while some others with a non - thermal one .",
    "in other cases either component can give an explanation to the detected variation .",
    "thus , another important contribution of this research is that , analyzing the _ spectral microvariability _ , we have found that the om might be generated in either the disk or the jet , regardless of the radio classification of the quasars , crlq or rqq .",
    "additionally , some variations in rlqs are consistent with thermal om and vice versa .",
    "thus , our results indicate that microvariability in both quasar type might be originated under similar conditions .",
    "in addition , although the continuum emission can be fitted in all cases by a unique non - thermal component , the broad band spectral variation may require to assume the presence of a second component , of thermal origin .",
    "the relative contribution of each component is an important parameter that should be taken into account for the description of spectral variability .",
    "additional studies must be carried on to investigate the effects of these contributions on the type of quasar that we observe , and if this can be expended to the blazar class .",
    "this result agrees with the discovery of small relativistic jets in rqqs ( @xcite ) and explains previous results ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although this method yields interesting results applied to our data , it is desirable to have a monitoring with a better temporal resolution , as well as to observe in more bands .",
    "more realistic models are also necessary .",

    "<S> we present a method that we developed to discern where the optical microvariability ( om ) in quasars originates : in the accretion disk ( related to thermal processes ) or in the jet ( related to non - thermal processes ) . analyzing nearly simultaneous observations in three different optical bands of continuum emission , we are able to determine the origin of several isolated om events . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , our method indicates that from nine events reported by @xcite , three of them are consistent with a thermal origin , three to non - thermal , and three can not be discerned . </S>",
    "<S> the implications for the emission models of om are briefly discussed . </S>"
