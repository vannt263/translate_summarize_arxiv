    "aside from resolving a number of issues in the standard hot big bang scenario ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , including the horizon problem and overabundance of magnetic monopoles , inflationary cosmology has made a number of predictions consistent with current observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "these include the expectation of an almost spatially - flat universe and an approximately scale - invariant power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbations , as confirmed by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite and , more recently , the planck satellite @xcite .",
    "many models of inflation also predict a cosmological gravitational wave background , parametrized in terms of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath0 .",
    "recently , the bicep2 experiment @xcite reported a detection of b - mode polarization in the cmb .",
    "when interpreted as being produced by such a background of primordial gravitational waves , this translates into a tensor - to - scalar ratio of [ bicep2r ] r = 0.20^+ 0.07_- 0.05 , around @xmath1 , i.e.  @xmath2",
    ". this would be in tension with the previous limit set by planck @xcite of @xmath3 ( @xmath4 c.l . ) at the pivot scale @xmath5 , i.e.  @xmath6 .",
    "such a value for the amplitude of the gravitational wave background would determine the scale of inflation to be at the gut scale .",
    "moreover , a value of @xmath7 would rule out a large number of inflationary models in which the displacement of the field is smaller than @xmath8 @xcite . super - planckian excursion of the inflaton field can be realized within a number of models , including assisted inflation @xcite , natural inflation @xcite , string - inspired many - field models @xcite and monodromy @xcite . in addition , values of @xmath9 can be realized in scalar models in which the potential has flat directions @xcite .",
    "many authors have proposed solutions to alleviate the tension between bicep2 and planck on both theoretical @xcite and experimental grounds @xcite . in non - singular",
    "bouncing cosmologies @xcite , it was shown @xcite that the emergence of jump features in the scalar and tensor power spectra at a given scale may conspire to lessen this discrepancy .",
    "this tension can also be alleviated in starobinsky models  @xcite , if the speed of the inflaton field undergoes a sudden change @xcite .",
    "in addition , sharp features are observed in the scalar power spectra in models of punctuated inflation , where the shape of the inflaton potential changes discontinuously at a given scale @xcite .",
    "an inflaton potential with a step was studied in the einstein frame @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and shown to result in oscillations in the power spectra .",
    "fading oscillatory features in the primordial scalar power spectrum can also occur from jumps in the potential @xcite , particle production during inflation @xcite or turns in the inflaton trajectory in the landscape of heavy fields @xcite . for",
    "a discussion of observed features in the primordial power spectrum , see for instance @xcite and references therein .",
    "recently , there has also been renewed interest in models of inflation with time - varying gravitational constants @xcite .",
    "the potential time - dependence of physical constants has long been recognized @xcite and variation in the effective gravitational coupling is known to arise in theories of modified gravity , such as brans - dicke scalar - tensor @xcite and tensor - vector - scalar ( teves ) theory @xcite .",
    "the latter provides a relativistic basis for milgrom s modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) @xcite .",
    "time - dependency may also arise in supersymmetric string theories @xcite .",
    "the implications of a time - varying gravitational constant ( see also @xcite ) have been studied in the radiation and matter dominated epochs @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that modulations of the gravitational constant can result from the non - minimal coupling of a massive scalar field that oscillates around its vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "it was found that cosmological measurements can be affected when the frequency of oscillations is high compared to the hubble expansion rate .",
    "this work was extended in @xcite to consider a scenario in which the brans - dicke field is driven away from its vev during inflation , thereby inducing oscillations . for cosmological perturbation theory in models beyond general relativity ,",
    "see @xcite , @xcite and references therein .",
    "there are various experiments that test models with a time - dependent newton s constant : lunar ranging observations @xcite , big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite , gravitational waves @xcite and , more recently , the wigglez experiment @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that the late - time evolution of the gravitational constant can be constrained through comparisons of the ages of globular clusters with independent measurements of the age of the universe @xcite and by observations of type 1a supernovae @xcite , as well as pulsating white dwarfs @xcite , pulsars @xcite and neutron - star surface temperatures @xcite .",
    "such limits on the variation of the gravitational constant place constraints on scalar - tensor theories @xcite in addition to those obtained from observations of primordial density perturbations @xcite and gravitational cherenkov radiation @xcite .    in this article , we show that sharp features may arise in the scalar power spectra as a result of transitions in the effective planck mass ( or equivalently newton s gravitational constant ) during inflation . specifically , we address the question of whether smooth step variations in the gravitational coupling , occurring during the observable window of scales between 60 and 50 @xmath10-folds before the end of inflation @xcite , have sizeable effects on the power spectra for curvature and tensor perturbations .",
    "step changes in the planck mass could result from a first - order phase transition in the vev of a brans - dicke field @xcite .",
    "alternatively , as we will consider , the step change could arise through a second - order transition , with the brans - dicke field rolling slowly towards its vev .",
    "we consider two scenarios : one in which the role of brans - dicke field is played by the inflaton itself and a two - field model in which this role is played by a second auxiliary field .",

    "instead , they are typically of order a percent or less .",
    "nevertheless , we illustrate that , for a particular choice of parameters for the single - field model , the impact upon the resulting power spectra and , consequently , the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath0 has the potential to alleviate the aforementioned discrepancy between bicep2 and planck .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to potentials with a step @xcite , we show that oscillations are not observed in the scalar power spectra when the step transition occurs instead in the non - minimal coupling of the brans - dicke field .",

    "our goal is to study the influence of variations in the effective planck mass ( or equivalently newton s gravitational constant ) on inflation and the primordial power spectra for scalar and tensor perturbations .",
    "this can be described conveniently in the context of scalar - tensor theories .",
    "specifically , we will focus on the case in which the evolution of the inflaton itself causes this variation by means of its non - minimal coupling to the ricci scalar .",
    "for this reason and throughout this article , we choose to perform the computations in the jordan frame , which allows us to model these variations in the planck mass intuitively .",
