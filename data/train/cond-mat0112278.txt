    "recent experiments @xcite showing clear evidence for the existence of charge - order ( co ) in several 2:1 cationic organic charge transfer solids ( cts ) have stimulated considerable theoretical interest @xcite .",
    "as these materials are nominally @xmath0-filled ( one electron or hole per two sites ) and involve electron - electron ( e - e ) interactions ( including nearest - neighbor coulomb repulsion @xmath3 ) , the apparently obvious charge ordering in the quasi-1d cts systems is the wigner crystal - like `` ... 1010 ... '' state , and numerous theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies have argued for this possibility .",
    "the site occupancies ` 1 ' and ` 0 ' actually correspond to 0.5 + @xmath4 and 0.5 - @xmath4 , respectively , with @xmath4 an important measurable quantity .",
    "the ... 1010 ... co corresponds to a 4k@xmath5 cdw ( spatial period 2 ) , where k@xmath6 is the fermi wavevector in the absence of coulomb interactions , with @xmath7 the lattice constant . on the other hand , in previous work we @xcite and others @xcite",
    "have shown that for realistic values of @xmath3 and when electron - phonon ( e - ph ) interactions are included , a `` ... 1100 ... '' charge ordering can become the ground state , and , importantly , that this co state can explain the  mysterious \" states observed in several cts @xcite , in which coexisting charge and spin density waves _ of the same periodicity _ occur .",
    "the ... 1100 ... co corresponds to a 2k@xmath5 cdw ( spatial period 4 ) and has a co - operative coexistence with the 2k@xmath5 bow or a mixed 2k@xmath5 + 4k@xmath5 bow , which is why we termed it a `` bond - charge density wave '' ( bcdw ) @xcite . in the present article",
    ", we examine critically the theoretical and experimental evidence for each of these two possible charge orderings in the quasi-1d organic cts . before proceeding to our analysis , it is useful to formulate in a precise manner several key questions related to the charge ordering in the organic cts .",
    "we focus here on four such questions .",
    "first , the ... 1010 ...",
    "co ground state requires both strong on - site coulomb repulsion ( @xmath8 within the extended hubbard model ) _ and _ nearest - neighbor coulomb repulsion ( @xmath3 within the extended hubbard model ) to be greater than a critical value , @xmath9 .",
    "for any comparison to real materials determining the correct value @xmath9 is essential . both hartree - fock ( hf ) and",
    "exact many - body methods have been used to estimate @xmath9 .",
    "how reliable are the hf estimates quantitatively , and do they exhibit the correct qualitative trends as @xmath10 varies ?",
    "second , charge ordering is only one of the phenomena observed in organic cts . at lower temperatures , broken symmetry states involving spin ordering ",
    "spin - peierls ( sp ) and spin density wave ( sdw ) states  are typically observed , to say nothing of superconductivity .",
    "many of the quasi-1d cts materials that show co also feature sp ground states at low temperature .",
    "our previous work @xcite establishing the bcdw state proves that the 1100 co _ is _ consistent with sp . to our knowledge",
    ", none of the theoretical    studies proposing the existence of ... 1010 ... co @xcite has investigated whether a sp phase can occur within the ... 1010 .... cdw at lower temperatures .",
    "indeed , an early quantum monte carlo study @xcite can be taken to suggest that a sp phase could _ not _ coexist with the ... 1010 ... cdw . is 1010 co consistent with a sp phase at low temperatures , and if so , under what conditions ?    third , any successful theory of charge ordering within the organic cts must explain not only the mechanism and pattern for co , but also the temperature scale at which it occurs",
    ". in particular , any complete theory of co in these materials must be able to explain the existence of different temperatures for the metal - insulator ( mi ) , co , and sp transitions .",
    "does either of the theoretical models for co explain the observed sequence of transitions ?",
    "fourth , the ultimate arbiter in the ... 1010 ... vs. ... 1100 ... debate is experiment , and in this regard it is clearly desirable to have as broad a range of probes and materials as possible .",
    "both the 2:1 cationic cts ( with holes as carriers ) and the 1:2 anionic cts ( with electrons as carriers ) have been studied extensively using similar theoretical and experimental approaches .",
    "what is the experimental evidence for ... 1010 ... and for ... 1100 ... in both these classes of materials ?",
    "we address these questions in the remainder of this paper . in section [ vcrit ]",
    "we introduce the the electronic extended hubbard model and compare exact to mean field calculations . here",
    "we establish that hf theory exaggerates the role of the ... 1010 ... co and that the _ realistic _ range of parameter values for which this co is obtained is rather narrow . in section [ 4kfcdwsp ]",
    "we introduce e - ph couplings and show that it _ is _ possible for a spin peierls transition to occur with the ... 1010 ... co phase in section [ temperature ] , we discuss the theoretical expectations for the sequence of temperatures at which the various transitions  metal - insulator ( mi ) , charge order ( co ) and spin - peierls ( sp) occur , establishing that within the strictly 1d ... 1100 ... co model , @xmath11 , whereas within the strictly 1d ... 1010 ... co model , @xmath12 . in section [ expt ]",
    "we compare our theoretical results with experimental data on a wide variety of cts , both cationic and anionic .",
    "these comparisons establish that in both the anionic 1:2 cts and the ( tmtsf)@xmath2x the dominant co pattern appears to be ...",
    "1100 ... , which in the latter case coexists with a sdw ( because of two - dimensional effects @xcite ) rather than a sp phase . for the ( tmttf)@xmath2x cts ,",
    "the situation appears less certain , but ...",
    "1010 ... order appears to be favored .",
    "we propose specific experiments to distinguish definitively between the two different co patterns .",
    "we also show in section [ temperature ] that the experimentally observed temperatures of the mi , co , and sp transitions are not fully consistent with either ... 1010 ... or ... 1100 ... models in their strictly 1d forms .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusion_section ] , we summarize our results and list some open problems for future research .",
    "we first consider the 1d extended hubbard hamiltonian    [ eqn - exthub ] @xmath13 \\\\ h_{ee } & = & u\\sum_{j}n_{j,\\uparrow}n_{j,\\downarrow } +   v\\sum_{j}n_{j}n_{j+1 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the above , @xmath14 is a site index , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is spin .",
    "we focus on the @xmath0-filled case , with the average number of electrons ( or holes ) per site , @xmath17 .",
    "in addition to the purely electronic terms in eq .",
    "( [ eqn - exthub ] ) , we will also consider e - ph couplings explicitly in section [ 4kfcdwsp ] .    that for @xmath18 there exists a critical value ( @xmath1 ) of @xmath3 for the appearance of the 4k@xmath5 cdw ( ... 1010 ... ) within the @xmath0-filled 1d `` pure '' extended hubbard model in eq .",
    "( [ eqn - exthub ] ) has been known for decades @xcite , and several detailed studies of @xmath1 for finite @xmath10 have appeared in recent years @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it appears that the implications of these theoretical results have been insufficiently appreciated in the recent literature on organic cts .",
    "thus , we believe these results and the underlying arguments bear revisiting briefly here . in the limit @xmath18 ,",
    "the @xmath0-filled band of spin-@xmath19 electrons becomes equivalent to a half - filled band of spinless fermions @xcite , which in the presence of @xmath3 can be mapped using a jordan - wigner transformation to the heisenberg xxz chain .",
    "this rigorous mapping and the exact solution for the xxz model establish that for @xmath20 , the system is in the ( gapped ) `` ising - heisenberg '' phase , which in terms of the original electronic model corresponds to the 4k@xmath5 cdw order ...",
    "1010 ... for @xmath21 , the spin system is in the `` heisenberg - xy '' phase and there is no gap , which in the _ pure _ extended hubbard model corresponds to a luttinger liquid ( ll ) with no charge order . hence for @xmath22 , the critical value of @xmath3 is @xmath23 .    for finite @xmath10",

    "the relevance of presenting the true phase boundary in the @xmath27 plane ( as determined by accurate many - body methods ) becomes clear when one considers the results obtained in a number of recent studies of the @xmath0-filled 1d extended hubbard model using mean - field approximations @xcite .",

    "the sizes of the 4@xmath70 cdw and 4@xmath70 cdw - sp regions increase considerably with @xmath3 and occur for smaller values of @xmath68 .",
    "second , the existence of the 4@xmath70 cdw - sp ground state is very robust@xmath3 does not appear to suppress this sp order .",
    "third , fig .",
    "[ fig - dws ] illustrates one clear qualitative difference between the two sp phases _ in this finite size system_. provided that @xmath67 is greater than a critical value depending on @xmath3 ( @xmath76 ) , the bcdw occurs for all @xmath77 .",
    "in contrast , occurrence of the 4@xmath70 cdw - sp state requires both @xmath67 and @xmath68 to be non - zero .",
    "note however that as @xmath3 is increased , the _ minimum _ value of @xmath68 ( call it @xmath78 ) , for which the 4@xmath70 cdw - sp state exists decreases rapidly towards zero , while the value of @xmath67 necessary to produce this phase at @xmath78 increases slightly .",
    "these intriguing finite size results beg the question of what happens to the system in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath79 .",
    "unfortunately , our limited data do not allow us to perform a reliable finite size scaling analysis , and we can thus provide only tentative , partial answers at this stage .",
    "we believe that in the @xmath80 limit the undistorted and 4@xmath70 bow phases disappear ; our evidence for this comes from our earlier studies of the bcdw ( hence for @xmath81 ) on long _ open _ chains @xcite , which showed that the center of these chains distorts naturally into a bcdw but which showed no sign of a pure 4@xmath70 bow .",
    "similar studies for @xmath54 have thus far proven inconclusive , and the @xmath82 behavior in this regime remains an important open question .",
    "our self - consistent exact diagonalizations give results for site charges , bond orders , and hopping integrals for all the phases , homogeneous and inhomogeneous . in fig .",
    "[ slice ] we present the actual site charge    densities and bond orders for @xmath62 , @xmath83 , and @xmath74=0.6 .",
    "this plot corresponds to a vertical `` slice '' through fig .",
    "[ fig - phasediag](b ) , and shows the 4@xmath70-cdw , 4@xmath70-cdw - sp , and bcdw phases .",
    "several points are suggested by the data in fig .",
    "[ slice ] .",
    "first , in the 4k@xmath5 cdw - sp state , the sites with smaller charge density are no longer equivalent  there is now ( as expected from the bond distortion ) a small charge difference between these two sites .",
    "thus , the 4k@xmath5 cdw - sp state is characterized by two different bond orders and _ three _ different site charges , as opposed to the two different charges and three different bond orders of the bcdw state , which are also seen clearly in fig .",
    "[ slice ] .",
    "we shall return to this point momentarily .",
    "second , the quantitative values of the site charge differences , @xmath31 , in the bcdw state are quite small , whereas the @xmath31 in the 4@xmath70 cdw and 4@xmath70 cdw - sp states are considerably larger .",
    "we have not been able to find , in our finite system calculations , any bcdw state with large @xmath31 , nor any 4@xmath70 cdw or 4@xmath70 cdw - sp states will small @xmath31 .",
    "third , and similarly , the bond order differences in the bcdw are always quite large , whereas the bond order differences in the 4@xmath70 cdw - sp phase are always quite small .",
    "again , these intriguing results for finite size systems beg the question of the behavior for @xmath82 , and again we can not provide definitive statements because our data are not sufficient to allow a reliable finite size scaling analysis . one argument suggesting that the large @xmath31 may _ not _ be an inevitable consequence of the ... 1010",
    "... co comes from the @xmath18 limit and the mapping to the heisenberg - ising model ; translating the exact results into fermion language shows that charge difference in the ... 1010 ... co phase is given by @xmath84 , so that it starts from zero and remains small for a large region of @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "clearly , further study of these potentially significant differences in the @xmath86 limit is required .    beyond the quantitative distinctions ,",
    "however , there is the clear _ qualitative _ distinction between the bcdw and the 4@xmath70 cdw - sp states : namely , the former always has two different site charges and three different bond orders , whereas the latter has three different site charges and two different bond orders .",
    "this qualitative distinction will persist in the large system limit and is in principle accessible to experimental techniques sensitive to the local charge or bond order environment .",
    "for instance , if nmr measurements can be made below the spin peierls transition temperature ( @xmath87 ) in a given cts , they should be able to distinguish cleanly between the bcdw and the 4@xmath70-cdw - sp states .",
    "we will return to this and related points in our comparisons to experiment .",
    "our calculations in sections [ 4kfcdwsp ] and [ vcrit ] , as well as virtually all other theoretical studies , have been limited to ground state results only . however , the issue of the temperature dependence of the co and mi transitions is quite important in applying the results of 1d model calculations to experimental systems . in this section",
    ", we discuss the temperature dependence expected for ... 1010 ... and ... 1100 ... models of co.    as the ... 1010 ... co is driven by @xmath3 , it is expected to give co already at quite high temperatures . the series of transitions can be understood by recognizing that the ... 1010 ... co has two equivalent configurations , ... 1010 ... and ...",
    "0101 ... , corresponding to a double - well potential . for temperatures above the co transition temperature , both possible configurations ... 1010 ... and ...",
    "0101 ... have equal weight in the partition function , resulting in no net co and a metallic state .",
    "the co transition then corresponds to a symmetry breaking between ... 1010 ... and ... 0101 ... , with the result that co and mi transitions ( at @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively ) happen at the _ same _ temperature .",
    "as we have shown in section [ 4kfcdwsp ] , a sp distortion _ can occur _ within the ... 1010 ... co phase , but its scale is set by the e - ph couplings and is expected to be well below the electronically driven @xmath90 .",
    "thus within the ... 1010 ... model ( see fig .  [ fig - temp](a ) ) , one expects two transitions , a combined high temperature co / mi transition    followed by a low temperature sp transition .    in the ... 1100",
    "... co model , one must consider a quadruple - well potential @xcite . at the highest temperatures there are four equivalent configurations , ...",
    "1100 ... , ... 0011 ... , ... 0110 ... , and ... 1001 ... , again giving a metallic state when all four have equal weights .",
    "the high temperature transition corresponds to a symmetry breaking that leaves ... 1100 ... and ... 0011 ... with equal weight , resulting in no net co , but an insulating state .",
    "then at lower temperature , the ... 1100 ... / ... 0011 ... symmetry breaks , resulting in co. as the ... 1100 ... co is a _ cooperative _ bcdw state , co and bond distortion occurs _ simultaneously",
    "thus within the ...",
    "1100 ... model ( see fig .  [ fig - temp](b ) ) , one again expects two transitions , a high temperature mi transition , followed by a low temperature combined co / sp transition .",
    "if detailed comparisons of models to real systems are to be attempted , accurate estimates of the e - e and e - ph parameters are required .",
    "determination of @xmath10 and @xmath3 from quantum chemistry calculations is difficult , and in general such calculations give values that are too large @xcite .",
    "fortunately , there is by now general agreement on the magnitudes of @xmath91 in the different materials , and reasonable values of @xmath10 and @xmath3 can be estimated from the experiments .",
    "we consider primarily materials based on the tcnq , tmtsf , and tmtsf molecules .",
    "it is generally accepted that the values of @xmath91 in the cationic tmttf / tmtsf and anionic tcnq cts lie between 0.1  0.25 ev .",
    "we then agree with previous investigators that @xmath92 in ( tmttf)@xmath2x ranges from 7 - 12 @xcite and is less than 6 in ( tmtsf)@xmath2x @xcite .",
    "based on comparing relative 4k@xmath5 responses@xcite ( a signature of large @xmath92 ) , one may conclude that for tcnq systems @xmath92 is intermediate between the tmttf and tmtsf limits .",
    "there are far fewer estimates of @xmath93 : values of 2.8 for ( tmttf)@xmath2x and 2.0 for ( tmtsf)@xmath2x have been proposed by mila @xcite .",
    "we note that whether or not @xmath94 can be determined from the experimental pattern of the co , if it is known . on the other hand ,",
    "given the relatively small @xmath92 in ( tmtsf)@xmath2x , it is unlikely that @xmath94 in this system ( recalling the additional condition that @xmath95 , based on general considerations of the nature of realistic coulomb interactions . ) . to summarize , in the quasi-1d materials",
    ", we believe that @xmath96 . for the e - ph couplings , the dimensionless coupling constants @xmath97 and @xmath98 are even more difficult to estimate @xcite . for our overall purposes",
    ", it suffices to note that there is evidence for both nonzero @xmath39 and @xmath40 . finally ,",
    "although in this paper we do not explicitly model the effects of transverse coupling of the 1d chains , ( see reference for a quantitative discussion of these effects ) , we shall comment on these higher dimensional effects in some of the experimental discussion below . in this regard",
    "it is important to recall that the electronic anisotropy and effective e - e interaction strengths can vary _ independently _ among the cts .",
    "the relative strength of the e - e interactions is measured by the ratios @xmath92 and @xmath93 , whereas the effective dimensionality is measured by @xmath99 ) .",
    "these three ratios vary considerably among the materials .",
    "in particular , the tmttf materials are both highly 1d and very strongly correlated , whereas the tmtsf materials are less 1d and also less strongly correlated .",
    "let us turn now to discuss the experimental situations with individual classes of materials .      as mentioned in the introduction , we believe that a complete understanding of the co phenomenon in the @xmath0-filled band cts requires that both cationic and anionic cts be examined on the same footing .",
    "the availability of large single crystals in the case of the anionic systems makes these particularly attractive . on the other hand ,",
    "the anionic cts are much older and many different contradictory claims exist in the literature .",

    "\\(i ) the very high temperatures at which the co is observed in some of these cts ( t@xmath112 = 154 k and 227.5 k in x = sbf@xmath110 and reo@xmath111 , respectively ) indeed suggests the ...",
    "1010 ... order , since long range ...",
    "order @xcite is associated with the sp transition , which usually occurs at much lower temperatures .",
    "one possibility ( not yet thoroughly explored , let alone established ) that would allow higher temperature co within the ... 1100 ... scenario is that in at least some of the ( tmttf)@xmath2x the co is associated with pre - transitional structural fluctuations from the sp transition . theoretically , it has been claimed that such fluctuations of the sp order may become visible at temperatures as high as 3  4 t@xmath101 , where t@xmath101 is the sp transition temperature @xcite .",
    "experimentally , structural fluctuations associated with the sp transitions have been observed in the related sp materials ( bcpttf)@xmath2pf@xmath110 and ( bcpttf)@xmath2asf@xmath110 at temperatures as high as 100 k and 120 k , respectively , even though their sp transition temperatures are t@xmath101 = 37k and 34 k , respectively @xcite .",
    "it is then intriguing that in ( tmttf)@xmath2pf@xmath110 scattering at 2k@xmath5 in x - ray experiments begins to appear at nearly the same temperature @xcite at which co appears in nmr @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) nmr experiments lead to estimates of a lower limit of 0.5 for @xmath31 @xcite , which also supports the ... 1010 ... co , since within our finite size calculations we have never found such a large @xmath31 within the 1d ... 1100 ... phase . while the large @xmath31 would be in agreement with the ...",
    "1010 ... order , the difficult of determining @xmath31 unambiguously from these experiments is shown by the results similar nmr experiments on the inorganic material nav@xmath2o@xmath113 , in which also co involving the vanadium sites is observed and in which the pattern of the co remains controversial after considerable study .",
    "these experiments have not led to @xmath31 values that are consistent : widely different @xmath31 , ranging anywhere from 0.1 to 0.8 have been reported in the literature in this case @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) recent nmr experiments on x = asf@xmath110 under pressure also find that the co is very sensitive to pressure and is suppressed for pressures greater than @xmath1080.15 gpa @xcite .",
    "the great sensitivity to pressure raises further questions regarding the co in ( tmttf)@xmath2x : if the co in ( tmttf)@xmath2x is of the ... 1010 ... pattern and hence driven by large @xmath3 , one would expect that increased @xmath114 from the application of pressure would have little effect on the co. importantly , studies of two - leg @xmath0-filled ladders find @xmath9 in the ladder to be quite similar to the value in 1d for small @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "\\(iv ) it has been suggested that the mi transition at higher temperatures is not driven by intrastack 4k@xmath5 bond dimerization ( which is unaccompanied by co ) , but by the anion potential @xcite .",
    "ascribing the metal - insulator transition to the anion potential , however , is also problematic .",
    "for instance , if the anion potential leads to a 4k@xmath5 bond dimerization , there is further increase in @xmath9 , and the ... 1010 ... co becomes even less likely @xcite . on the other hand , if the anion potential led to the ...",
    "1010 ... co directly , evidence for the co should have been found already at the metal - insulator transition . as regards the widely differing t@xmath112 , it is possible that different anion sizes lead to different interchain couplings , which in turn affect the @xmath9 .",
    "\\(v ) finally , why is t@xmath112 is so _ low _ in some of these systems ( t@xmath115 65 k and 100 k in x = pf@xmath110 and asf@xmath110 , respectively @xcite ) ?",
    "the charge localization / metal - insulator transition @xmath89 in ( tmttf)@xmath2pf@xmath110 occurs at @xmath116 200 k _ above _ the co temperature , while ( as explained in section [ temperature ] ) for the ... 1010 ... model one expects @xmath117 .",
    "a possible resolution to ( i)(v ) is that the higher temperature co found in ( tmttf)@xmath2x is indeed ...",
    "1010 ... , while the lower temperature sp state has ...",
    "1100 ... co. transitions at finite temperature are determined not by the ground state energy but by the free energy . at temperatures",
    "t @xmath118 t@xmath119 , the excitations of a strongly correlated system are predominantly spin excitations .",
    "because of the greater multiplicities of high spin states , the free energy at high t ( but below t@xmath119 ) is then dominated by high spin states .",
    "consider now the fully ferromagnetic state , which is clearly described within the _ spinless _ fermion hamiltonian limit of eq .",
    "( [ eqn - exthub ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath1 in this state remains 2@xmath91 even for finite @xmath10 and is smaller than the @xmath1 for the ground state with total spin s = 0 . for similar reasons we expect for finite @xmath10 , @xmath1 to increase progressively as the total spin s decreases .",
    "therefore , for a system in which @xmath3 is slightly lower than @xmath1 ( s = 0 ) but higher than @xmath1 ( s = s@xmath120 ) we see that at high temperatures , where high spin excitations are thermally accessible , the co pattern can be ...",
    "1010 ... at lower temperatures where the high spin states become thermally inaccessible and the free energy is dominated by low spin states there can be a switching to the ... 1100 ... co. we are current exploring this scenario in detail .    finally , we suggest two experiments that can settle the issue of co in ( tmttf)@xmath2x . first , x - ray or neutron diffraction experiments can probe the actual bond distortions below the sp transition : with sufficient sensitivity , they should be able to distinguish the @xmath47 distortions associated with the ... 1100 ... co from the @xmath52 distortions associated with the ... 1010 ... co. second , as shown in section [ 4kfcdwsp ] , we predict three different charges below t@xmath101 for the case of the ... 1010 ... co ( rather than the two charges associated with the ...",
    "1100 ... state ) .",
    "if nmr experiments can be extended to this temperature region , further splitting of the nmr lines is predicted .",
    "unfortunately , our results also suggest that the charge difference between the two  0 s is rather small , and an extremely sensitive probe might be necessary to determine the new splitting .",
    "our conclusions can be summarized as follows .",
    "first , formation of the wigner crystal - like ... 1010 ... co requires v within the 1d extended hubbard model that is much larger than that predicted within mean field theory .",
    "further , mean field theory predicts the incorrect behavior of @xmath9 as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "accurate many - body calculations show that for finite @xmath10 , @xmath121 and increases with decreasing @xmath10 .",
    "second , we have given a complete theory of the sp transition that can occur in the correlated 1d @xmath0-filled band .",
    "the sp phase with the ... 1100 ... co is a bcdw , with two different charges and three different bonds , the bond distortion pattern being @xmath47 .",
    "in contrast , the sp phase in the ... 1010 ... co has two kinds of bonds and three distinct charges ; the bond distortion pattern here is @xmath52 , and this distortion makes the charges on the sites labeled ` 0 ' unequal .",
    "several distinct types of experiments have confirmed the existence of two kinds of charges and three kinds of bonds in a number of 1:2 anionic cts . in ( tmtsf)@xmath2x , experiments find coexisting cdw and sdw with the _ same _ periodicity , which as discussed above precludes the ... 1010 ... co. the situation in the ( tmttf)@xmath2x is less clear , as experiments showing the existence of co do not directly measure the specific co pattern .",
    "we know of no experiments to date that have confirmed the existence of the three types of charges and two types of bonds associated with the sp phase of the ... 1010 ... we believe that the nmr and x - ray experiments that could confirm this should have high priority .",
    "third , within the strictly 1d models , the two charge orders predict different scenarios for the temperature dependence of the co. for the ... 1100 ... co , @xmath122 , whereas for the ...",
    "1010 ... c0 , @xmath123 .",
    "neither of these results is in agreement with all the experiments , which in general show @xmath124 .",
    "we believe that weakly 2d inter - chain couplings , which explain the transition from cdw - sp to cdw - sdw ground states in some of the materials @xcite , may also be the key to understanding the ordering of @xmath89 , @xmath88 , and @xmath87 in the different cts .",
    "support for this belief comes from recent results on the strongly 2d @xmath125-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2x materials , in which @xmath89 occurs simultaneously with @xmath88 , followed by a lower temperature spin - gap transition @xcite .",
