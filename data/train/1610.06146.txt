    "the velocity autocorrelation function ( vaf ) is a key quantity in the translational dynamics of a fluid at the microscopic scale @xcite .",
    "phenomena such as thermal and mass diffusion , sound propagation , transverse - wave excitation , having either a single - particle or a collective nature , are all reflected , through the motions of individual particles , in a fundamental quantity , which , in the usual statistical - mechanical treatment of a many - body system , is expressed in terms of the time autocorrelation function of an atomic variable , namely the particle velocity @xcite .    on its own ,",
    "the vaf is not a directly measurable quantity , and its investigation has been for a long time a topical subject of theoretical and simulation studies @xcite .",
    "it is well known that a major reason for studying the vaf was the detection , in a molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation of a hard - sphere ( hs ) fluid at intermediate density , of a long - time tail ( ltt ) well accounted for by a power law @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "a number of simulation studies were later devoted to fluids with more realistic interaction potentials , in order to establish the presence and the time behavior of the ltt depending on the thermodynamic conditions of the fluid @xcite .",
    "it was found that the ltt was most easily detected at intermediate densities in the gaseous state , while in dense liquids other dynamical effects on shorter time scales , such as backscattering due to the bouncing of atoms off near neighbours , effectively hide the ltt @xcite .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "both hydrodynamics - based arguments @xcite and kinetic theory for hs fluids @xcite led to the time dependence @xmath0 and provided the same expression for the amplitude coefficient @xmath1 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : a - balucani ] ) below ] .",
    "however , as recently recalled @xcite , the two treatments lead to different results for the asymptotic vaf time dependence .",
    "moreover , the theoretical predictions have not been confirmed by a two - dimensional simulation of a very large system of hard disks @xcite .",
    "although so much attention was paid to the ltt issue , it is clear , however , that the vaf contains relevant information about the atomic dynamics at all time scales , starting from the very - short - time binary collision processes",
    ". therefore , a complete approach to the vaf analysis should cover in a consistent way the full time range from zero up to the ltt regime in any thermodynamic state of the fluid .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite , this goal has been attained , for a lennard - jones ( lj ) fluid at a supercritical temperature and intermediate densities , by exploiting a general property of correlation functions of dynamical variables in a many - particle hamiltonian system , whose time dependence has been recently shown to be represented as infinite series of ( complex and/or real ) exponentials @xcite . in summary , it was found @xcite that , for all the considered thermodynamical states considered and in the whole time range accessed by md , the vaf is described perfectly by fitting the sum of a small number of exponential terms .",
    "four of them are real exponentials having decay times ranging from the order of one collision time ( `` fast modes '' ) up to the order of several tens of collision times ( `` slow modes '' ) .",
    "the slowest - decay exponential , and to a lesser extent the second - slowest one , together build up a long - time behavior which reproduces the ltt at least as accurately as the power - law dependence .",
    "in addition to the real ones , other terms present in the fit function are two pairs of complex conjugate exponentials representing damped oscillations .",
    "each of them is characterized by a decay time , also of the order of , or less than , one collision time , and a frequency close to the collision frequency .",
    "these modes represent fast oscillatory components of the vaf and correspond to vibratory motions of the particles .",
    "all the parameters describing the various modes represented by exponential terms display a completely smooth density dependence , signaling a continuous evolution of all aspects of the atomic dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , one observes that the intensity of the complex modes grows with density at the expense of the fast real modes .",
    "this was then naturally interpreted as the evolution towards the formation of better structured nearest - neighbor cages favoring oscillatory motions , though strongly damped .",
    "it has to be noted , however , that this picture still refers to the case where the vaf displays a behavior typical of a medium - density gas rather than that of a liquid , and shows , for example , a monotonic decrease without reaching negative values .",
    "the effectiveness of this analysis in allowing for a simple and consistent description of the entire time dependence of the vaf has naturally suggested to extend this approach to thermodynamic states closer to a liquidlike , and even true - liquid , behavior , for a number of reasons .",
    "one is the fact that it is still unclear whether the ltt persists in denser and/or colder fluids , given that the overall decay to zero reduces the vaf intensity to very small values in the time range where the ltt should be its dominant feature .",
    "however , a more important point is the above mentioned change of the vaf shape and sign .",
    "so far , no theory has produced a model able to describe , at the same time and in an accurate way , both the negative portion of the vaf and its subsequent growth to positive values , followed by the final decay to zero from above .",
    "this is the time range where oscillatory components of the total vaf develop when the dynamical behavior tends to the one typical of a liquid .",
    "the interpretation of the frequency spectrum of the vaf as a density distribution of states , which is straightforward for a crystalline solid , when extended to the fluid phase provides , in principle @xcite , a route to the investigation of the dynamics also for what concerns the collective motions .",
    "however , no clear way of carrying out this task has been developed so far .",
    "it is , thus , a main goal of this work to explore the possibility of exploiting the mode decomposition provided by the exponential expansion in order to relate the various vaf components to specific collective and single - particle motions typical of a fluid .",
    "we have , therefore , performed more md simulations in order to extend the analysis carried out in ref .",
    "[ ] both to the high density supercritical fluid and to some liquid states at subcritical temperatures .",
    "the results of this analysis will show that the evolution of the fitted exponential terms in number , nature , intensity and time scale , gives indeed valuable insight on the identification of some of the fitted modes with specific dynamical properties .",
    "in particular , besides the already recognized role of slowly decaying exponentials in accounting for the ltt @xcite , which is confirmed by the new simulations , we also demonstrate the correspondence between the highest - frequency complex mode and the dispersion curve of longitudinal acoustic wave propagation .",
    "moreover , we will show that the remaining exponential modes represent the transverse collective dynamics and that their density evolution provides clear evidence of a crossover .    in this context",
    "it is worth to mention recent studies @xcite that have discussed the existence of a transition between a low - density gaslike and a high - density liquidlike dynamical regime of a supercritical fluid .",
    "this crossover was identified by brazhkin and coworkers @xcite with the crossing of the so - called frenkel line , which has been eventually connected directly to the onset of a nonmonotonic time dependence of the vaf @xcite .    in sect .",
    "[ sect : simul ] we present the results of the new simulations .",
    "after a brief summary of the exponential mode analysis ( sect .",
    "[ sect : multiexp ] ) , its results are reported and discussed in sect .  [",
    "sect : results ] .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in sect .",
    "[ sect : concl ] .",
    "md simulations of the vaf for the lj ( 126 ) fluid along the slightly supercritical @xmath2 isotherm were already reported for particle number densities up to @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "here we consider higher density states ( with @xmath4 varying from 0.65 to 0.95 in steps of 0.05 ) at the same temperature , reaching a density very close to that where isothermal solidification begins .",
    "moreover , we simulated a few colder liquid states along the @xmath5 isochore and below the critical isotherm , with @xmath6 .",
    "the point at @xmath2 , @xmath5 thus belongs to both the isotherm and the isochore here considered . throughout this paper , asterisks denote standard reduced variables , like @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the energy and length scale parameters of the lj potential .",
    "the particle mass will be denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "figure [ fig : thermodyn ] shows the state points in the @xmath13 plane , including for completeness and reference also the lower density states of ref .  [ ] .",
    "all simulations were performed , and the respective vaf s computed , exactly in the same way as in the previous work @xcite , to which we refer the reader for any detail , here recalling only that the same number of particles @xmath14 was used in a cubical box for all states , and that simulations of @xmath15 timesteps , with @xmath16 , were carried out in the isokinetic ensemble and repeated ten times in order to estimate statistical uncertainties . the result is a set of normalized velocity autocorrelation functions    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the velocity of a particle at time @xmath19 and @xmath20 includes an average over all particles .    for all thermodynamic states considered here , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : vaf_linear ] the low - intensity part of @xmath21 at small values of the reduced time @xmath22 .",
    "this is where the mentioned changes in shape take place . in detail , starting from a monotonous decay of @xmath21 , the increase of density at constant @xmath23 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : vaf_linear](a ) ] leads to the the presence of a plateau which soon changes into a relative minimum .",
    "this already happens when @xmath21 still remains everywhere positive , but with a further density increase this minimum deepens and shifts to smaller times , the curve crosses the zero axis to become negative , and another shallow minimum appears at a later time .",
    "the changes of shape on cooling the system at constant density , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vaf_linear](b ) , are less marked and are characterized essentially by a strengthening of the negative portion of @xmath21 .    the behavior of @xmath21 at long times is best appreciated in figs .",
    "[ fig : vaf_isoth ] and [ fig : vaf_isoch ] where the log - log scale is used for an easy comparison with a power - law time dependence . as already recalled @xcite , the calculated vaf beyond a certain time",
    "is affected by spurious effects due to the use of periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "this occurs for time lags greater than the so - called recurrence time @xmath24 required by a density fluctuation to propagate over the box length at the adiabatic sound speed @xmath25 .",
    "values of @xmath26 , calculated using sound speed data @xcite , are reported in tables [ tab : tempi_isoth ] and [ tab : tempi_isoch ] .",
    "we also display @xmath26 in figs .",
    "[ fig : vaf_isoth ] and [ fig : vaf_isoch ] , where the recurrence problem shows up as a spurious overall reduction of the vaf intensity , which also displays some oscillatory and rapidly increasing noisy behavior , for @xmath27 .",
    "it can be noted that , at constant temperature , @xmath26 markedly decreases with increasing density due to the simultaneous reduction of the box size and increase of @xmath25 , while , at constant density , @xmath26 increases weakly with decreasing temperature due to the reduction of @xmath25 brought about by the lowering of the particle thermal speed .",
    "further analysis of the vaf , described in later sections , will be performed , at each state , using data in the respective @xmath28 ranges only .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     another important point is that propagation of acoustic modes , either longitudinal or transverse , depends not only on the thermodynamic properties of the fluid but also on the wavevector values , a fact critically relevant , in particular , for the transverse excitations .",
    "indeed , it is customarily stated that a dense fluid can sustain transverse waves , but only for wavevectors above a certain value @xcite , in agreement with the fact that in the hydrodynamic limit @xmath29 the transverse current autocorrelation spectrum has the lorentzian shape typical of diffusive processes @xcite without any nonzero - frequency excitations , and this theoretical result holds true even for dense liquids .",
    "it follows that a transverse dispersion curve can be defined only for @xmath30 larger than the minimum required .",
    "therefore , the crossover we are dealing with is the transition between the situation where no transverse modes propagate _ at any _",
    "@xmath30 , and the one in which they propagate _ at least in some _ @xmath30 range .",
    "consideration of only one of the two relevant variables ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) will only allow for an incomplete account of the transverse dynamics .",
    "an evidence of this fact is provided by fig .  [ fig : trans_disp ] , where the transverse dispersion curve for a lower density state begins at a larger @xmath30 value .",
    "analogous results have been very recently obtained in another study of lj dynamics @xcite .    as recalled in sect .",
    "[ sect : intro ] , the issue of a separation between two different regions of the thermodynamic state space of a supercritical fluid , marked by a crossover boundary , has been a largely debated topic in the last years .",
    "following seminal insight and theoretical developments of frenkel @xcite , the crossover frenkel line has been identified through the occurrence of specific properties @xcite , actually not all coinciding as far as the line position in the pressure - temperature plane is concerned . among such properties",
    "are the onset of propagation of transverse waves , the emergence of positive dispersion in the propagation of longitudinal sound modes , and the temperature dependence of the constant - volume specific heat per atom crossing the value @xmath32 .",
    "another criterion for the definition of the frenkel line specifically involves a property of the vaf , as it is formulated by assuming the crossover to occur when the vaf shape begins to display a relative minimum and a relative maximum instead of a monotonic decay @xcite . as seen in sect .",
    "[ subsect : low ] , we obtain a very similar localization of our crossover condition .",
    "however , it should be remarked that the discussion about boundary lines in the fluid phase diagram has been mostly concerned with the transition induced by changing temperature and pressure in wide ranges , including consideration of highly supercritical fluid states at very large pressures . in constrast , we have obtained evidence of a crossover driven by the density alone in isothermal conditions at temperatures just above the critical point .",
    "the extension of the exponential mode expansion of the vaf to a wider density range than that already investigated @xcite has allowed us to follow in detail the transition between a dilute and a very dense lj fluid at a weakly supercritical temperature , and to study the modifications brought about by a constant - density cooling down to liquid temperatures not far from the triple point .",
    "the multi - exponential analysis thus confirms its validity as a powerful method of analysis of correlation functions of disordered systems .",
    "in addition , this study has revealed the wealth of information contained in the vaf , due to its underlying relationship to all kinds of dynamical processes taking place in a system of particles undergoing various kinds of both collective and independent motions .",
    "a great step forward with respect to the previous work consists in the identification of the nature of the various modes obtained through the fit of the exponential model .",
    "in fact , the modification of the fit model required at the various thermodynamic states has allowed us to understand the evolution of the vaf properties , providing essential suggestions for the definition of groups of modes to which clear and specific physical meaning could be attached . in this way we have identified the mode representation of three fundamental dynamical processes typical of a simple monatomic fluid , i.e.  the long - time tail , the propagation of longitudinal sound waves , and the transverse dynamics with its clear transition to the excitation of propagating waves .",
    "our work confirms recent results on the existence of a crossover in the fluid state evidenced by the density evolution of the vaf time dependence .",
    "the multi - exponential analysis allowed us to bring to the foreground the role played here by the changing nature of transverse dynamics .",
    "it is useful to assess the relative importance of the various processes as represented by their partial contributions to the total time - integrated vaf , reported in table [ tab : integrals ] as percent fractions , for all thermodynamic states .",
    "it is shown that the ltt contribution is the smallest one , being confined to the long time range where the vaf intensity decreases to very low values .",
    "the high frequency modes related to the sound propagation show a clear trend , growing in importance with both increasing density and decreasing temperature . finally , the low frequency modes related to the transverse dynamics account for about half of the total vaf integral with no significant variation with the thermodynamic coordinates .",
    "this is interesting , because it evidences that the strength of the modes involved in the crossover does not show any abrupt change across the transition boundary .",
    "we recall here from ref .",

    "( [ complexexp ] ) are real .",
