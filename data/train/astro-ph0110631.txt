    "globular clusters are found in their largest numbers within giant elliptical and cd galaxies .",
    "while the clusters constitute only a small fraction of a galaxy halo s mass , they are the most easily identified surviving structures of the initial stages of galaxy formation .",
    "this makes them important tracers of galaxy formation models . from deep wide - field imaging , several features of the globular cluster system",
    "can readily be derived , including the radial distribution , luminosity distribution , and the total population ( specific frequency @xmath8 ) .    in this paper",
    "we obtain measurements of the globular cluster systems ( gcss ) in the central giant e galaxies within four abell galaxy clusters in the redshift range @xmath9 km s@xmath10 .",
    "these are ngc 708 in a262 , ngc 5193 in a3560 , ic 4296 in a3565 and ngc 7014 in a3742 .",
    "the raw data are wfpc2 @xmath1band exposures drawn from the hst archive . preliminary studies of these systems were made by @xcite , but using only the pc1 chip data ; we make use of all the wfpc2 data available , more than doubling the amount of information on the globular cluster luminosity function ( gclf ) in each galaxy , and also enabling us to study the gcs radial distributions and specific frequencies with much higher confidence . finally , using the gclf turnover magnitude and redshift of these galaxies and others in the literature , we construct a purely gclf - based hubble diagram and show that it is consistent with @xmath11 .",
    "the original images were taken in the f814w filter by @xcite with the wfpc2 camera , between january and april 1996 ( program i d 5910 ) .",
    "the target galaxies were centered in the high resolution pc1 chip , hence maximizing the total globular cluster population falling within the field of view of the entire camera .",
    "the exposures ( totaling between 9200 and 16500 s ) were sub - pixel - shifted . with standard iraf and stsdas routines , we co - added each group to reconstruct clean composite images free of bad pixel artifacts and cosmic ray contamination .",
    "various small areas on each image were masked out in subsequent analysis to eliminate contamination from diffraction spikes of bright stars , or neighboring galaxies in the field .",
    "also , the innermost parts of the target galaxies themselves were masked out , within radii of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 from the centers of the galaxies respectively .",
    "we next subtracted background light from the combined images .",
    "for this purpose we used a simple median filter on the wf2,3,4 fields , where the background light gradient is low .",
    "however , for the pc1 chip , we fitted elliptical isophotes ( using stsdas and ellipse ) to the galaxy , generating synthetic isophotal contours which were then subtracted from the original .",
    "with the galaxy light subtracted , we found that some of the galaxies exhibited various types of interesting substructure .",
    "the most prominent of these is the inner region of ngc 708 , which exhibits an easily seen dust lane ( see the illustrations of each one shown in lauer et al . ) .",
    "smaller dust lanes were also detected within ngc 5193 and ic 4296 , indicating likely accretion events in the recent past .",
    "@xcite found that a262 , the host cluster for ngc 708 , contains galaxies deficient of hi gas , suggested as due to ram - pressure stripping .",
    "this gas could be accreted by the central cd galaxy , with its large dark halo .",
    "a262 is a spiral - rich cluster , characterized by a x - ray source , 3u 015 + 36 , which appears concentric with the central galaxy .",
    "the gas and galaxy virial temperatures for the cluster have recently been shown to be comparable by @xcite .",
    "there seems to be a general pattern for hi deficiency to be associated with x - ray emission , some other examples being a2147 in hercules , or coma .    our procedures for photometry of the four combined images follow the basic sequence outlined in more detail elsewhere ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "of the many detected faint starlike objects on the frames , the vast majority are globular clusters within the bcgs . at these distances ( @xmath16 55 mpc )",
    "they appear as unresolved point sources , even in the pc1 frames .",
    "hence , it is easy to perform conventional point - spread function ( psf ) photometry on the frames .",
    "independent empirical psfs were constructed from several moderately bright , uncrowded stars in each of the four wfpc2 frames with daophot .",
    "then allstar @xcite was used to generate the final photometry .",
    "a standard detection threshold of 3.5 times the rms scatter of the sky background was adopted for the image detection .",
    "crowding at all magnitudes was completely negligible in these high - latitude fields .",
    "an image classification algorithm ( classify ; defined by @xcite and @xcite ) was then used to calculate radial image moments of the candidate objects and thus to separate stellar from nonstellar objects in an objective way . by using artificial - star data passed through exactly the same measurement process , we established boundaries for the classify parameters such that at least 95% of the true stars were retrieved at all magnitudes ( for very similar examples with illustrative graphs , see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "as usual , for the faintest objects the image moments become very uncertain , and it becomes difficult to distinguish between stellar and nonstellar objects . also , some nonstellar objects will be accidentally classified as stellar .",
    "these are statistically removed from the final gclf by subtracting a background luminosity function ( see below ) .    finally , to define the photometric completeness function we constructed annular rings around the bcgs , and employed extensive artificial - star tests to measure the detection completeness @xmath17 , as a function of magnitude and radial distance . in practice we found that the pc1 chip with its strong background light gradient was the only area where @xmath18 was a significant function of radius ; on the wf chips a single function @xmath19 could be used .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes were converted to the johnson - cousins @xmath0 system with the standard transformations for @xmath20 found in @xcite .",
    "for the four individual bcgs , galactic extinction corrections of @xmath21 0.16 , 0.10 , 0.11 and 0.06 respectively have been adopted ( @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 , where the @xmath24 values are obtained for each galaxy from nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) ) . to employ the transformation equations and also to step back and forth between @xmath0 and the ( more normally used ) @xmath25 magnitude scale for globular clusters , we have simply assumed a color index of @xmath26 , typical of moderately metal - rich globular clusters in giant e galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the intrinsic range in @xmath27 , folded through the transformation equations , will not introduce uncertainties larger than @xmath28 in the calibration of @xmath0 .",
    "the assumed @xmath27 value is the mean value representative of most other ge galaxies , and if the gcss were entirely metal - rich or metal - poor , the error introduced by the assumption would be at most 0.1 mag .",
    "the projected number density @xmath29 of detected objects around each galaxy plainly reveals an extensive gcs concentrated around the galaxy center in each case .",
    "the profile is reasonably well represented by a simple power - law form @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the background number density of starlike objects ( mostly faint , small galaxies which passed through the image classification routines , plus a few foreground galactic stars ) . to obtain the profile parameters of the gcs for each galaxy , we subdivided the wfpc2 fields into annuli 50 pixels wide , centered on the bcgs .",
    "the number density of objects was then calculated down to a cutoff magnitude at which incompleteness corrections were still small .",
    "the projected number density is then just @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the number of detected objects within each annulus and @xmath34 is the area of that annulus which falls within the wfpc2 boundaries ( minus the small masked - out areas ) .",
    "completeness corrections , though small , were explicitly accounted for .",
    "finally , the background density @xmath31 on each of the four fields was defined as the mean of the outermost eight annuli , which fall on the outskirts of the wf chips .",
    "this corresponds to a radial distance greater than @xmath35 ( or about 30 kpc ) from the centers of the bcgs .",
    "although the gcss probably extend at trace amounts farther out than this boundary , the directly observed @xmath36 curves ( figure  [ rad_plot ] ) have plainly almost leveled off there , indicating that we are already including the main portion of the gcs .",
    "figure  [ lograd_plot ] shows log - log plots of the background - subtracted density profiles for the four bcgs , and table  [ rad_table ] lists our deduced values for the power - law index @xmath37 , as well as the adopted @xmath31 .",
    "we note the bumpiness of the @xmath38 curve for ngc 708 in abell 262 .",
    "it exhibits a clear peak around @xmath39 , and a less clear peak around @xmath40 .",
    "if not simply statistical fluctuations , these could be the result of uncompensated background contamination ( clumpiness in the distribution of faint , ultra - distant galaxy clusters , or even some residual globular cluster populations which belong to neighboring galaxies in a262 ; there are several smaller elliptical galaxies as well as a companion spiral in the wfpc2 field ) .",
    "also , the slope of the @xmath38 curve for ic 4296 in a3565 declines smoothly out to about @xmath41 , and then exhibits a relatively sharp drop - off .",
    "this effect is not apparent in the other three systems .",
    "it is possible that this feature , if real ( and not just a prosaic result of overestimating the background count ) , is due to tidal truncation .",
    "there are no large nearby galaxies in the immediate vicinity of ic 4296 .",
    "however , @xcite in a _ rosat _ study of groups and poor clusters find that the x - ray contours in a3565 are not centered on the bcg , but rather at a point roughly halfway between ic 4296 and the neighboring spiral ic 4299 .",
    "the mass that @xcite have derived for the x - ray gas is about one - third of the mass of the entire cluster derived from the galaxy velocity distribution @xcite .",
    "it might therefore be possible that the bcg oscillates about the center of the potential well of the cluster , which could be responsible for the truncation of its halo .    for luminous giant",
    "e galaxies like these , the gcs profile shape is expected to be rather flat , becoming more shallow as galaxy luminosity increases .",
    "a general relation for the power - law slope is @xcite .",
    "@xmath42 the only one of our four target bcgs which deviates fairly strongly from this empirical relation is ngc 708 ( an observed slope @xmath43 versus an expected one of @xmath44 ) .",
    "it is , however , the only one in our sample with a cd envelope , which has clearly made it more radially extended than normal .",
    ".radial density profile data [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     sources : ( 1 ) @xcite ; ( 2 ) @xcite ; ( 3 ) @xcite ; ( 4 ) @xcite ; ( 5 ) @xcite ; ( 6 ) this paper",
    "using deep @xmath0-band photometry from the @xmath45/wfpc2 archive we have studied the globular cluster systems in ngc 708 , ngc 5193 , ic 4296 and ngc 7014 , the bcgs in a262 , a3560 , a3565 and a3742 .",
    "the photometry allowed us to construct the globular cluster luminosity functions for each of the above cluster systems , reaching to or just past the turnover point .",
    "we have used a constrained @xmath46 method to fit a gaussian function to each of the four gclfs , adopting a width @xmath47 .",
    "the resulting background and extinction corrected @xmath25-band turnover magnitudes were found to be at @xmath48 = 26.84 @xmath49 0.17 , 26.91 @xmath49 0.18 , 26.63 @xmath49 0.16 , 26.75 @xmath49 0.19 respectively .",
    "these values improve on previous results of @xcite .",
    "the hubble diagram generated from our gclf turnover data combined with other material from the literature matches @xmath50 .",
    "we have obtained the luminosity and mass distribution functions for the gcss .",
    "the slopes of the power law relations were found to be consistent with those for other giant elliptical galaxies , with the exception of ngc 5193 in a3560 .",
    "the total cluster populations @xmath51 and the specific frequencies @xmath8 for each system were calculated .",
    "the specific frequency of ic 4296 in a2565 is surprisingly low for its high luminosity , while the values for the other three galaxies fall within the established trend of specific frequency versus galaxy luminosity .",
    "we would like to thank j.j.kavelaars and marcel vandalfsen for useful comments and advice .",
