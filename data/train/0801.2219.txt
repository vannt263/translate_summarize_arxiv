    "dynamic nuclear polarization ( dnp ) is a method of creating hyperpolarized nuclear spins in solids , liquids or gases in a non - equilibrium fashion . for decades",
    ", it has been utilized to enhance sensitivity in the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) method .",
    "recently , nuclear - spin - related phenomena in semiconductors have attracted much attention , which has added renewed interests to dnp .",
    "examples include electron spin dynamics in semiconducting nanostructures@xcite and solid - state nmr quantum computers;@xcite the hyperpolarized nuclei are utilized as a means to control electron spin states in the former , while they are expected to serve as initialized states for quantum computation in the latter . with the emergence of these new applications , it has become increasingly important to control positions , degrees of polarization and the nuclear species to be polarized , i.e. , to manipulate hyperpolarization .    to achieve this purpose",
    ", one needs to create , transfer and localize nuclear spin polarizations in desired positions efficiently , which may require a variety of techniques to be integrated.@xcite nuclear spin polarizer ( nsp ) is one of such schemes.@xcite in this scheme , hyperpolarization is created in compound semiconductors such as inp and gaas by the optical orientation ( optical pumping ) method,@xcite where nuclear spins are hyperpolarized by polarized electrons photo - excited by circularly polarized light with the band gap energies of the semiconductors .",
    "the hyperpolarization thus created is manipulated by means of various polarization transfer techniques in solids , such as the cross polarization , polarization transfer and spin diffusion , which enable us to transfer hyperpolarization between different nuclear species , different portions in the semiconductor , or even different materials through the interfaces . in the last case",
    ", the polarization can be localized at the interfaces . @xcite    the polarization transfers in this scheme rely on hyperfine- and heteronuclear - couplings in semiconductors so that it is essential to understand their characteristics .",
    "our understanding on them is still insufficient , however .",
    "the characteristics of the hyperfine couplings responsible for the polarization transfer from photo - excited electrons to nuclei in the optical orientation process are still open to debate .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the strengths and angular dependences of the heteronuclear couplings in inp have been measured in the thermal equilibrium,@xcite but those between optically oriented nuclei still remain undetermined .    in this paper , we address these issues from the viewpoint of the characteristic time scales of the polarization transfer processes i.e. , the cross - relaxation time between hyperpolarized nuclei , @xmath3 and the buildup time for nuclear polarization by photo - excited electrons , @xmath4 . the former ( @xmath3 ) provides us with information on heteronuclear couplings between hyperpolarized nuclei . in ",
    "[ cross relaxation ] , we show in the case of the semi - insulating iron - doped inp ( inp : fe ) that the polarization transfer is predominantly mediated by nearest - neighbor indirect @xmath2-couplings , and that their angular dependence is not of a simple pseudo - dipolar type .",
    "the latter ( @xmath4 ) , on the other hand , provides us with information on the hyperfine couplings responsible for the nuclear spin orientation , which are closely related to the states of the photo - excited electrons . in  [ buildup time ] , we show that the nuclear - site dependence of @xmath4 is a good measure to determine the types of hyperfine couplings and that , in the case of inp : fe , the polarization transfer from photo - excited electrons to nuclei is primarily brought about by the electron - nuclear dipolar couplings .",
    "the optical - nuclear - orientation and cross - polarization experiments were performed at 10 k with the optical pumping double resonance system.@xcite the system includes a two - channel ( xy ) nmr spectrometer ( apollo , tecmag inc . ) , a ti : sapphire tunable laser ( 3900s ) pumped by a diode - pumped nd : yvo@xmath5 cw green laser ( millennia vs , spectra - physics inc . ) , and a home - built top - loading xy double - resonance probe with an optical fiber attachment .",
    "the probe is installed in a dynamic gas - flow cryostat ( spectrostat 86/62 , oxford instruments inc . ) , which is mounted on a 270 mhz ( 6.346 t ) wide - bore superconducting magnet ( oxford instruments inc . ) .",
    "the ti : sapphire laser provides linearly polarized light with the wavelength ranging between 600 and 1000 nm , which is transmitted to the sample space at the probe end by a polarization maintaining optical fiber ( panda , fujikura co. ltd . ) , then converted to circularly polarized light with a quarter waveplate before being applied to a sample .",
    "the sample used in this study was a wafer of the semi - insulating iron - doped inp with the crystal orientation of ( 100 ) and the carrier density at room temperature of @xmath6 @xmath7 ( showa denko , lot @xmath820044202 ) .",

    "the pulse sequence for @xmath9 ( primary nuclei , @xmath0p ) , @xmath10 ( secondary nuclei , @xmath1 in ) and ir ( infrared light with the photon energy of @xmath11 and the helicity of @xmath12 ) used in the optical - orientation - cross - polarization experiments is schematically shown in fig . [ sequence ] .",
    "it consists of the following four processes , i.e. , ( 1 ) saturation , ( 2 ) optical pumping , ( 3 ) cross polarization and ( 4 ) detection .",
    "( 1 ) at the beginning , saturation pulses consisting of eight @xmath13 pulses are applied to both the nuclei , which extinguish the initial polarizations at thermal equilibrium .",
    "( 2 ) the sample is irradiated only with the infrared light for the duration of @xmath14 , which creates polarizations of both the nuclei inside the illuminated region of the sample .",
    "the polarization in the bulk ( outside of the illuminated region ) can also grow toward the equilibrium state for this duration .",
    "the @xmath9-polarization , however , does not recover because the spin - lattice relaxation time @xmath15 at @xmath0p is much longer than @xmath14.@xcite .",
    "the @xmath10-polarization , on the other hand , is extinguished again by the saturation pulses at the end of the duration .",
    "consequently , only the optically oriented @xmath9-polarization in the illuminated region remains at the end of the duration .",
    "( 3 ) the cross - polarization is applied between the @xmath9- and @xmath10- spins , which transfers the @xmath9-polarization to @xmath10 in the illuminated region , but not in the bulk because of the lack of @xmath9-polarization there .",
    "( 4 ) the @xmath10 signal from only the illuminated region is detected as a free induction decay . in our experiments ,",
    "the effective duration time @xmath16 was fixed at 120 s.",

    "the @xmath17 dependence of the @xmath1 in magnetization under the ir irradiation is shown in fig .",
    "[ contact time dependence ] .",
    "one may find that the decay process is negligible ( @xmath24 ) .",

    "it is intriguing to see whether or not @xmath29 is affected by the difference in the photon energy @xmath11 .",
    "we measured @xmath29 at two photon energies , @xmath11 = 1.386 and 1.407 ev , at both of which the @xmath0p polarization is strongly enhanced by the optical orientation effect . the result is summarized in table [ table:1 ] , which shows that @xmath29 is independent of @xmath11 within the experimental error .",
    "one of the possible explanations for this result may be relaxation of the photo - excited electrons , which occurs with a time scale much faster than @xmath3 , so that the electrons excited with different @xmath11 would result in the same meta - stable state .",
    "we also measured @xmath29 at two different ir - irradiation times @xmath16 = 60 s and 240 s , which is intended to investigate the effect of nuclear spin diffusion process .",
    "it is expected that for greater @xmath16 , nuclear polarizations may spread out farther from the positions where polarizations are originally created .",
    "provided the spin diffusion constant @xmath30@xmath31/sec,@xcite the expected diffusion lengths @xmath32 = 24 and 49 nm for @xmath16 = 60 s and 240 s , respectively.@xcite the result is shown in table [ table:1 ] , which indicates that @xmath29 is almost independent of @xmath16 .",
    "i.e. , @xmath29 is not very sensitive to the distance from the photo - excited electrons , at least , up to about 50 nm .",
    ".photon - energy ( @xmath11 ) and ir - irradiation - time ( @xmath16 ) dependences of the cross - relaxation rates ( @xmath29 ) measured at 10 k and 6.346 t. [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the fermi contact interaction with thermally excited electrons , @xmath33 is given by,@xcite @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the probability of electrons / holes at the nuclear site , and @xmath36 being the carrier density .",
    "hence , the large difference in @xmath33 between @xmath0p and @xmath1 in originates from that in @xmath35 . at indium sites , the conduction band consists mainly of s - orbitals and has large @xmath35 , while it is small at phosphor sites where the wave function mainly consists of p - orbitals of the valence band .",
    "the fermi contact interaction , however , is less effective for non - degenerated trapped electrons because of the following reason . to conserve energy in the flip - flop process ( @xmath37 ) , the electrons should be excited to the state with the small excitation energy of @xmath38 corresponding to the nuclear zeeman energy , while no such excited states are available at fermi level in the non - degenerated electrons .",
    "the dipolar interaction , on the other hand , contains non - secular terms such as @xmath39 , which flip nuclear spins @xmath9 without flipping electron spins @xmath10 . in this case",
    ", @xmath40 is given by,@xcite @xmath41 which contains no @xmath35 .",
    "hence , contrary to the case of the fermi contact interactions where @xmath35 is the origin of the nuclear - site dependence , the nuclear - site dependence in this case stems from the differences in the gyromagnetic ratio ( @xmath42 ) and the lattice - averaged @xmath43 , i.e. , @xmath44 .",
    "the nuclear - site dependence of @xmath40 allows us to estimate the ratio of @xmath44 between @xmath0p and @xmath1 in . taking into account the fact that @xmath45 , eq .",
    "( [ t1 by dipolar couplings ] ) yields , @xmath46 using the relation @xmath47 and @xmath40 listed in table [ table:2 ] , one obtains , @xmath48 which means that indium nuclei are closer to the polarized electrons in average .",
    "this result is consistent with the values estimated from the lattice sums of @xmath43 as shown below .",
    "the calculation of the lattice sums of @xmath43 can be performed with the same calculation scheme as that used in eq .",
    "( [ s dipolar ] ) in  [ cross relaxation ] . assuming that the polarized electrons are localized at phosphor sites , the calculation yields , @xmath49 where @xmath50 in and @xmath51p and @xmath52 is the position of the phosphor site at which the polarized electron is localized .",
    "the agreement between eq .",
    "( [ distance ] ) ( experiment ) and eq .",
    "( [ distance - lattice - sum ] ) ( calculation ) is quite satisfactory .    to summarize , the experimental finding that @xmath53 and @xmath54 in inp : fe are of the same order indicates that the dipolar coupling is mainly responsible for @xmath40 in this material .",
    "this is consistent with the conclusion by patel et al .",
    "deduced from the sign of the nuclear polarizations.@xcite the present data also indicate that the photo - excited electrons may be located at phosphor sites , which may be related to antisites or iron trapping centers .",
    "this example shows that the nuclear - site dependence of @xmath40 provides us with information on the types of hyperfine couplings responsible for the nuclear spin orientation in the optical pumping process .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the characteristics of heteronuclear and hyperfine couplings in optically oriented semiconductors using the semi - insulating inp : fe .",
    "we have focused on the time scales in the polarization transfer processes , i.e. , the cross - relaxation time @xmath3 in the cross polarization and the buildup time @xmath4 in the optical nuclear orientation .",
    "we find that @xmath29 is greater than that expected from the nuclear dipolar couplings by one order of magnitude .",
    "this discrepancy can be accounted for by assuming the @xmath2-couplings of the order of 2 khz between nearest - neighbor @xmath1in-@xmath0p .",
    "the angular dependence of the @xmath2-coupling is inconsistent with that of a simple pseudo - dipolar type previously assumed , suggesting different anisotropy of the @xmath2-coupling . on the other hand",
    ", we show that the nuclear - site dependence of @xmath40 provides a clue to identify the hyperfine coupling responsible for the optical nuclear orientation .",
    "we find in the case of inp : fe that @xmath53 and @xmath54 are of the same order , indicating that the electron - nuclear dipolar coupling is primarily responsible for the nuclear spin orientation .",
    "it is also suggested that the photo - excited electrons are likely to be located at phosphor sites .",
