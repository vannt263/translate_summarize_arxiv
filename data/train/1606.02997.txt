    ", time evolution for infinitely slow parameters variation has been extensively studied within the so called adiabatic approximation@xcite , which is intimately related to the very rich berry phase physics@xcite .",
    "more recently , thanks to the advent of cold atoms@xcite , controllable time evolutions of the parameters , dubbed _ quantum quenches_@xcite , could be experimentally addressed@xcite , boosting at the same time the theoretical inspection@xcite . + a remarkable result is represented by the sharp distinction between the behavior of non - integrable and integrable systems@xcite . while the first locally thermalize , despite the unitarity of the time evolution of the system after the quench , integrable models can reach , under proper conditions , states which are locally described by stationary non - thermal density matrices@xcite .",
    "this peculiar behavior is associated with the presence of an infinite number of local or quasi local conserved quantities which prevent local thermalization .",
    "+ in order to describe such a behavior , the concept of generalized gibbs ensemble ( gge ) has been introduced@xcite .",
    "experimental evidence of such a thermodynamic ensemble has been gained by means of one dimensional ( 1d ) bosonic atoms trapped in optical lattices realizing the so called lieb - lininger model@xcite .",
    "+ from the theoretical point of view , the study of quantum quenches in integrable systems and their relaxation properties can benefit from the tools developed in order to deal with 1d quantum systems , among which the luttinger liquid ( ll ) model@xcite . within the latter paradigm , the main effects of interactions can be included , while all correlation functions can be easily computed .",
    "the validity of lls as low energy theories for 1d systems of fermions , bosons and spin , has been demonstrated experimentally by means of anomalous tunneling effects@xcite , or by observing spin - charge separation@xcite .",
    "moreover , the ll theory represents a very useful tool for the study of a wide range of 1d systems , including integer@xcite and fractional@xcite quantum hall effects and two dimensional topological insulators@xcite , weakly interacting quantum wires@xcite , even in the presence of spin - orbit coupling@xcite , carbon nanotubes@xcite , eventually including electron phonon coupling@xcite , spin chains@xcite and , complemented with its spin incoherent version@xcite , wigner crystals@xcite .",
    "+ the validity of the ll picture as a low energy theory for 1d hamiltonians is however limited to the low energy excitations of gapless phases@xcite .",
    "in quantum quench experiments its applicability is hence restricted to quenching protocols in which the hamiltonian is gapless at every time and excitations with high energy are not significantly populated .",
    "the interesting cases of quantum quenches across a quantum phase transition@xcite are hence excluded .",
    "+ despite its limitations , quantum quenches in lls define a very rich scenario@xcite which is interesting by itself , and , through its simplicity , offers a perfect playground for understanding many general features .",
    "sudden interaction quenches in lls provided the first analytical confirmations to the gge conjecture@xcite and allowed for very neat signatures of the ( experimentally observed@xcite ) light - cone effects@xcite , which are related to the lieb - robinson bounds@xcite for propagation of signals . moreover",
    "the possibility of addressing different quenching protocols allowed a better understanding of the crossover from adiabatic to sudden quenches@xcite .",
    "an even more interesting point about quantum quenches in lls is that , when the ll picture is applicable , its predictions are , under some conditions of locality of the mapping to the ll@xcite , universal@xcite : the long wavelength and low temperature results are in good agreement with numerical or semi - numerical results obtained by inspecting spin or fermionic lattice models .",
    "the power of the ll as a tool for studying 1d equilibrium systems is hence to some extent transferred to non - equilibrium situation .",
    "+ in this paper we investigate the time evolution of the particle density of a fermionic spinless ll with open boundaries  @xcite and subject to a finite duration linear quench of the inter - particle interaction .",
    "we focus on how the interplay between the time scale of the quenching protocol and the time scale introduced by the size of the system affects the transient and post - quench dynamics . due to its finite size",
    ", the system will never reach a steady state but it will continue to oscillate around a certain configuration  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the finiteness in time of the quenching protocol has even more interesting consequences .",
    "indeed , we show that _ both _ turning on and turning off of the quench ramp create light - cone perturbations in the density , which survive in the post - quench region .",
    "the two perturbations , starting from the edges  @xcite , travel ballistically through the system with the _ instantaneous _ velocity of the bosonic excitations of the ll  @xcite and bounce elastically whenever they reach a boundary . furthermore , in the post - quench region , their wavefronts interfere destructively and , thus , the dynamics is strongly affected by their relative position inside the system .",
    "we find that for adiabatic quenches the post - quench average density oscillates in time around the one obtained with a gge approach .",
    "for a fixed quench amplitude , the discrepancy between these two quantities decreases with an oscillatory behavior as a function of the quench duration , with local minima corresponding to a perfect overlap of the two light cones .",
    "finally we obtain that , for a long enough quench , the gge density approaches the ground state density associated with the final hamiltonian with the same decreasing oscillatory behavior as a function of the quench duration .",

    "these perturbations originate from the edges and propagate ballistically through the system with the instantaneous velocity of the ll bosonic excitations , bouncing elastically whenever they reach an edge . for peculiar values of the length of the quench ramp",
