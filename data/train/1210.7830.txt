    "due to its super - massive black hole and its close proximity of @xmath0 structures of the relativistic plasma jet in m87 can be resolved in radio to x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "this makes m87 a unique agn that potentially allows to spatially constrain the location of the tev @xmath1-ray emission ( radio / x - ray vs.  tev flux correlation studies ) .",
    "such a result would provide important input for agn unification theories and plasma jet physics .",
    "m87 is now a well established tev @xmath1-ray source @xcite with observed tev flux variability on time scales of days @xcite .",
    "the variability strongly constrains the size of the emission region to the order of ten schwarzschild radii .",
    "this rules out interpretations related to large scale emission from dark matter annihilation in m87 @xcite or cosmic ray interaction @xcite .",
    "leptonic @xcite and hadronic @xcite jet emission models are discussed in the literature as well as different potential locations of the tev @xmath1-ray emission : the nucleus @xcite , the inner jet @xcite or the ( large scale ) jet @xcite .    since 2007 tev @xmath1-ray observations of m87",
    "have been closely coordinated between veritas , magic , and h.e.s.s .",
    "this drastically improved the chances of detecting active flux states and substantially increased the scientific outcome of the observations . target - of - opportunity ( too )",
    "observations were proposed at radio ( vlba ) to x - ray ( chandra ) energies .",
    "so far , three tev @xmath1-ray flares have been detected in the past 13 years of m87 observations :    * 2005 : * h.e.s.s . observations in 2004/2005 confirmed m87 as a tev @xmath1-ray source .",
    "surprisingly , flux variability was found on time scales of days @xcite .",
    "the year 2005 also marked the maximum of an radio / optical / x - ray high state of the innermost knot in the jet , hst-1 , located roughly @xmath2 away from the core @xcite .",
    "since this high state lasted for almost one year   with correspondingly slow time scales of flux changes   it is not clear whether it was related to the tev flare .    *",
    "2008 : * a strong tev @xmath1-ray flare was detected in joint veritas , magic , and h.e.s.s .",
    "observations in 2008 confirming the day - scale flux variability @xcite .",
    "the flare marked the onset of a rise in the @xmath3 radio flux ( vlba ) from the nucleus .",
    "the vlba observations resolve the nucleus with very high precision of @xmath4 schwarzschild radii ; the radio nucleus is believed to be coincident with the black hole position @xcite . combining the radio and tev data therefore gave first experimental evidence that the tev emission actually originates from the close vicinity of the black hole @xcite .",
    "* 2010 : * the strongest tev @xmath1-ray flare so far was detected by veritas and magic in 2010 ( fig .",

    "radio , optical , and x - ray observations were triggered in addition to the accompanying fermi / lat observations of the source .",
    "although the flux of the radio nucleus remained at the base level the weeks following the tev flare   not confirming the 2008 finding   two interesting observations were made in the contemporaneous multi - wavelengths ( mwl ) monitoring : ( i ) the chandra observations ( starting @xmath5@xmath6 after the peak of the tev flare ) showed the second highest flux measured from the nucleus so far @xcite ( fig .  [ fig : general ] , left ) ; ( ii ) a new radio feature was identified in the knot hst-1 following the flare @xcite .",

    "this makes long term monitoring of m 87 in tev and other wavebands scientifically very fruitful .",
    "although promising indications were found in tev / mwl observation of previous years the location and mechanisms of the tev @xmath1-ray emission are still uncertain . however , due to its proximity and jet viewing angle , m87 remains a unique laboratory to study the connection between jet formation physics and tev @xmath1-ray emission @xcite .",
