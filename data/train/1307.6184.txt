    "the cold dark matter model based on structure formation through hierarchical clustering given by @xcite and @xcite is the most acceptable scenario of disc formation .",
    "gas ( baryons ) falling inside the spinning halo of dark - matter , acquires the same distribution of specific angular - momentum as the halo and conserves it while it cools and collapses which leads to the formation of disc inside the halo",
    ".    however , as the haloes grow hierarchically , mergers give rise to dynamical friction which leads to the loss of angular - momentum in these baryons ( or formed stars ) .",
    "additionally , the continuous accretion of intergalactic debris displaces stars from their disc orbits .",
    "these stars , which lose their angular momentum due to mergers and accretion , then sink to the centre of galaxies which leads to the formation of centrally concentrated stellar distribution supported by random motion @xcite .",
    "this centrally concentrated stellar distribution , with an amorphous smooth appearance , is defined as the bulge of the disc galaxy @xcite .",
    "the bulge s size compared with the size of the disc is one of the main classification criteria along the spiral sequence from early sa to sd , sm and i m types @xcite .",
    "bulges are , thus , a natural outcome of disc formation in the @xmath12cdm scenario @xcite .",
    "this is well reflected by the fact that no simulation based on the @xmath12cdm paradigm has been able to produce a single galaxy without bulge as yet @xcite .    however , the presence of a large number of giant bulgeless galaxies in the universe challenges this picture of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "the fragile thin disc of stars surviving mergers and accretion without any evidence of merger - built - bulges is potentially catastrophic for the lambda cdm model @xcite .",
    "the situation gets acute when we realize that many small bulges which were thought to be merger remnants , are found to be pseudo bulges .",
    "they are called pseudo - bulges as they have a high ratio of ordered - motion to random - motion and are understood to form mainly due to the secular evolution of isolated galaxy discs @xcite . in terms of cosmology , discs with pseudo - bulges are considered as pure - disc or bulgeless @xcite .",
    "the term `` bulgeless '' , thus , refers to disc galaxies which do not have a bulge or which support a pseudo - bulge .",
    "understanding the formation and evolution of bulgeless galaxies is one of the most challenging problems facing us . to that end , in this paper , we have examined the magnitude and size evolution of bulgeless galaxies in the past @xmath08 gyrs .",
    "their evolution is compared to that of normal - disc galaxies . ``",
    "normal - disc '' galaxies refer to disc galaxies with classical bulge , these discs are easily formed by models based on standard cosmology .",
    "the study is done in chandra deep field - south for the rest - frame _ b_-band ( 0.37 - 0.49 @xmath13 m ) in two equal volume redshift bins ( 0.4@xmath2z@xmath30.77 and 0.77@xmath2z@xmath31.0 ) .",

    "the correlation for discs has previously been explored @xcite , but the studies have come out with conflicting results .",
    "@xcite found that the mean half - light - radius of spiral galaxies has increased with time by @xmath025@xmath11 since z@xmath01.2 .",
    "@xcite found that the size function of large discs is approximately constant to z@xmath01 and discs are 0.8 mag brighter at z=0.7 . adding to that",
    ", @xcite found that the mean rest - frame blue - band surface - brightness for all morphological types increases by 0.95 mag up to @xmath5=0.9 .",
    "however , @xcite concluded that no discernible evolution remains in the surface - brightness of disc - dominated galaxies once a limit of @xmath1@xmath3 - 19 is put on the sample .",
    "they emphasized that the evolution seen by previous studies is due to selection - effects in which low - luminosity galaxies at lower redshifts are compared with high - luminosity ones at higher redshifts .",
    "this study was supported by @xcite , who found that for the high central surface - brightness limit @xmath14@xmath320.6 mag arcsec@xmath7 , no significant evolution is seen in the mean _",
    "b_-band surface - brightness .",
    "both these studies found a handful of luminous , high surface - brightness galaxies in the highest redshift - bin with a wide range of color and bulge - fractions .",
    "later , @xcite found a brightening of @xmath01 mag arcsec@xmath7 for disc galaxies in the rest - frame _ v_-band by z@xmath01 for @xmath15@xmath2 - 20 .",
    "they observed that the previous attempts , with high surface brightness limits , were selecting only those local galaxies which would , in principle , be observed at high redshift .",
    "this amounts to studying the very bright tail end of galaxy distribution at all redshifts , and hence , evolution was not seen .",
    "this was supported by @xcite .",
    "they found a substantial dimming of luminosity , @xmath16@xmath01.5-mag , since z=1 for large and intermediate - sized galaxies .",
    "also , @xcite observed that for the size - function of disc galaxies to remain constant since redshift 1.0 , the disc galaxies need to go fainter by 1 - 1.5 mag towards decreasing redshifts .    in this paper ,",
    "the disc sample has been divided into two groups , bulgeless and normal - discs .",
    "kormendy - relation along with the sersic - index criteria is used to make the division . the magnitude , size and surface - brightness evolution of the two morphological types",

    "vis - a - vis normal - disc galaxies can help understand the reasons for their presence and survival with time .",
    "we have studied the evolution of bright ( @xmath1@xmath2 - 20 ) bulgeless and normal - disc galaxies in the rest - frame _ b_-band in three redshift ranges ( 0.02@xmath2z@xmath30.05 , 0.4@xmath2z@xmath30.77 , 0.77@xmath2z@xmath31.0 ) .    in the magnitude - size distribution plots",

    "the overall dimming over the same range is of 0.86 mag arcsec@xmath7 .",
    "thus , the contribution to the dimming seen for the entire disc sample is more from the normal - discs than from the bulgeless sources .",
    "@xcite applied a magnitude cut of @xmath1@xmath3 - 19 and found that there is no significant evolution in the surface - brightness of disc galaxies .",
    "@xcite confirmed that no discernible evolution remains in the surface - brightness of disc - dominated galaxies once selection effects are removed .",
    "however , @xcite found a brightening of @xmath01 mag arcsec@xmath7 in disc galaxies by z@xmath01 for @xmath15@xmath2 - 20 .",
    "they emphasized that the lack of evolution in earlier studies is due to the hard lower surface - brightness cut that leads to the removal of substantial numbers of galaxies in the low - redshift bins .",
    "we have applied the magnitude cut @xmath1@xmath2 - 20 , according to the redshift and imaging limits .",
    "the results are in agreement with significant evolution , as for the whole disc sample , dimming of @xmath00.9-mag is seen up to z@xmath00.9 .",
    "it is an added fact that the dimming is largely from normal discs i.e. discs with bulge .",
    "the proportion of bulgeless galaxies in the full disc sample declines with decreasing redshift . for high - z bin ( 0.77 - 1.0 ) , 39.7@xmath11 of the discs are bulgeless , for low - z bin ( 0.4 - 0.77 )",
    ", it reduces to 34.7@xmath11 and for local - z bin ( 0.02 - 0.05 ) , it further reduces to 24.8@xmath11 . the change in morphology for some fraction of the bulgeless galaxies",
    "as we approach the present epoch may explain the considerable decline in their space - density and the decrease in their proportion with respect to the full disc sample .",
    "it can also be the probable reason for the larger amount of dimming seen in normal - discs as compared to the bulgeless galaxies .",
    "if the bulgeless ones , which are less bright than the normal - discs , switch over to the normal - disc sample with time , the normal - disc sample is expected to show a larger amount of dimming . to be able to substantiate the argument , the luminosity and size evolution of the two morphological types needs to be understood .    to examine luminosity evolution ,",
    "the schechter s function form is fitted on the density - distribution of bulgeless and normal - disc galaxies in the three redshift - ranges .",
    "the increase in characteristic - magnitude , @xmath8 , for bulgeless galaxies from @xmath5@xmath60.89 to @xmath5@xmath60.04 , is of 0.55-mag . for the normal - discs",
    ", the increase is of 0.95-mag , that is 0.4-mag more than that seen for bulgeless galaxies .",
    "the difference in the luminosity evolution of bulgeless and normal - discs is similar to the difference in their surface - brightness evolution .",
    "the faintness and dimming , with time , observed in the case of normal - discs is @xmath00.4-mag more than the faintness and dimming observed in the case of bulgeless galaxies .    in the size evolution",
    ", it is seen that the sizes show a log - normal distribution for both bulgeless and normal - disc galaxies in the three redshift - ranges .",
    "this is in concordance with the hierarchical growth model expectations and has earlier been observed for disc dominated sample as a whole @xcite .",
    "the increase in the mean value , @xmath9@xmath33 , from @xmath5@xmath60.89 to @xmath5@xmath60.04 , is of 0.114 for the bulgeless galaxies . for the normal - discs ,",
    "the increase is of 0.117 .",
    "the evolution of sizes with redshift is almost same for bulgeless and normal - disc galaxies .",
    "the bulgeless thus seem to be witnessing the same amount of accretion as the normal - discs .",
    "in addition to studying the evolution , the magnitude , size and sersic - index values of the galaxies in rest - frame _ b _ and _ i_-band ( for 0.4@xmath2z@xmath31.0 ) are compared .",

    "sersic - index is slightly higher in the _ i_-band and half - light - radius is larger in the _ b_-band .",
    "the argument that the bulge component shows itself more prominently in the _ i_-band and the disc structure is visible in full length in the",

    "it reflects that the stellar density is almost tracking the mass density in galaxies .",

    "the bulgeless galaxies are found to be slightly bluer ( @xmath1-@xmath29@xmath31 ) as compared to the galaxies with - bulge .",
    "this is expected because of the absence of bulges which are mostly populated with older stars .",
    "the major conclusions of the comparative study of bulgeless and normal - disc galaxies done in the optical over three redshift ranges have been that with decreasing redshift    1 .",
    "the dimming and faintness observed for normal - discs is more than that for bulgeless galaxies , 2 .",
    "there is a decrease in the proportion of bulgeless galaxies in the full disc sample , 3 .",
    "the increase in sizes for both morphological types is found to be almost similar .",
    "the stated outcomes support the argument that a fraction of the bulgeless galaxies witnessed bulge formation with time and switched to the normal - disc sample .",
    "it has been found , through theoretical models , that minor mergers and accretion leads to bulge growth in discs as the stellar content of the satellite simply gets added to the bulge of the primary @xcite .",
    "the fact that the rest of the bulgeless population remains intact even after being subjected to similar conditions , needs to be understood .    as a next step ,",
    "it is intended to bring more clarity to the difference in evolution of bulgeless and normal - disc galaxies .",
    "the asymmetry and clumpiness of stellar light , along with it s concentration , helps analyze the merger and accretion history of galaxies @xcite .",
    "we shall thus know if the continuous accretion has been responsible for the bulge growth in a fraction of bulgeless galaxies with time .",
