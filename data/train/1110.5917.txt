    "similar results have been seen in ref .",
    "in the critical region , non - fermi liquid behaviour exists on a large part of the fermi surface with strong angular dependence of @xmath72 as expected due to the critical fluctuations near orbital ordering ( now termed nematicity)@xcite .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , the critical point @xmath73 shifts to a lower value but the non - fermi liquid behaviour remains robust near the critical point .",
    "this strongly suggest that this non - fermi liquid behaviour should be observable in iron - pnictide superconductors at a temperature above the spt .",
    "one subtle point is that the effective interaction @xmath74 in eq .",
    "[ eq : gamma ] contains contributions from both the charge and spin channels . while for large momentum ( e.g. @xmath75 or @xmath76 ) there is no doubt that the contribution from spin channels is dominant as seen from previous calculations@xcite and also in our calculations , for small momentum , which we focus on here , the contributions from both charge and spin channels become comparable . as a result",
    ", we can not completely rule out the effects from the spin channels .",
    "however , since it has been shown@xcite that the spin nematicity could also induce orbital ordering , the critical collective modes associated with the orbital ordering discussed above will be still present in that case , despite the fact that the spectral weight might be reduced due to the coupling to the collective modes associated with spin nematic order . as a result",
    ", the non - fermi liquid behaviour discussed above will be most prominent if the contribution from charge channels in eq .",
    "[ eq : gamma ] is dominant .",
    "we find , in general , that the charge channels become much stronger for @xmath77 , which is consistent with previous studies of orbital ordering in sr@xmath78ru@xmath7o@xmath79 @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that the inclusion of electron - phonon coupling can also enhance the instability in the charge channels@xcite .",
    "since it is well - known that physical properties of iron - based superconductors could vary significantly for different families due to difference in details , we expect that the non - fermi liquid behaviour discussed above might not be visible in some families of the iron - based superconductors .",
    "this is actually what is seen in point contact spectroscopy and other experiments which will be discussed in sec .",
    "in this section , we discuss the fate of the non - fermi liquid behaviour in the c@xmath80 symmetry broken phase . for the nematic phase in a continuous model , these overdamped collective modes induced by the @xmath51-wave interaction evolve into goldstone modes but remain overdamped and dominate the low energy physics .",
    "consequently , the non - fermi liquid persists in the nematic phase . in the multiorbital model studied here , the situation is complicated by the fact that since the continuous rotational symmetry is absent in a lattice model , there are no gapless goldstone modes in general",
    "nevertheless , these overdamped collective modes remain existing with a gap @xmath81 due to the breaking of the discrete symmetry from @xmath2 to @xmath82 .",
    "consequently , the non - fermi liquid behaviour will be present as long as the temperature energy scale @xmath83 is larger than @xmath81 .",
    "note that @xmath81 is a gap in the density - density correlation function not in the single particle spectrum , since the orbital order ( like the nematic order ) does not gap out the fermi surfaces . as a result",
    ", it is expected that the non - fermi liquid will persist for a while as the temperature is lowered below @xmath8 and then gradually disappear at very low temperature where the orbital order is strong .",
    "this is analogous to the case of the ferromagnetic quantum critical point with a magnetic field where the critical fluctuations are gapped by the zeeman energy@xcite .",
    "a direct cconsequence of non - fermi liquid behaviour is the temperature dependence of the resistivity .",
    "it has been pointed out@xcite from studies on various iron - pnictide superconductors that a strong deviation from the fermi liquid @xmath84 behaviour of the resistivity above the spt temperature will occur if a large anisotropy in the in - plane resistivity exists below the spt temperature . since the anisotropy in resistivity is intimately related to orbital ordering , this observation provides direct evidence for our claim that non - fermi liquid behaviour is due to orbital fluctuations .",
    "an independent calculation including electron - phonon coupling to enhance the effect of orbital fluctuations by onari and kontani@xcite also showed unusual temperature dependence of the resistivity above the structural transition temperature .",
    "what about the zero - bias anomaly seen in point - contact tunneling experiments@xcite on electron - doped ba(fe@xmath5co@xmath6)@xmath7as@xmath7 ?",
    "intriguingly , this zero - bias enhancement starts to appear at temperatures roughly 30k higher than @xmath8 and remains robust well below @xmath8 .",
    "this observation is also consistent with our theory .",
    "it has been shown by lawler _ et .",
    "al._@xcite that the single particle density of states has the form of n^ * ( ) = n^*(0 ) + b ^2/3 + in the nematic critical region and also in the nematic phase .",
    "in fact , @xmath85 obtains extra contributions due to the non - fermi liquid self - energy , giving rise to a cusp at zero frequency and a subsequent decrease as the frequency increases .",
    "this provides a direct explanation for the zero - bias enhancement observed in point contact spectroscopy since the conductance @xmath86 roughly measures the single - particle density of states for small frequency .",
    "moreover , since the form of the single - particle density of states is the same up to some mild modifications in the vicinity of the critical point and also in the @xmath2 symmetry broken phase , the zero - bias enhancement should have a smooth crossover as @xmath8 is crossed , which in fact has been noticed in quantum point - contact measurements@xcite .",
    "we predict that for hole - underdoped ba@xmath5k@xmath6fe@xmath7as@xmath7 which does not have an in - plane resistivity anisotropy@xcite , the zero - bias enhancement should be either nonexistent or much weaker than that in electron - doped ba(fe@xmath5co@xmath6)@xmath7as@xmath7 .",
