    "electron neutrinos from @xmath0b decay in the sun have been detected at the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) by means of the charged current ( cc ) reaction on deuterium @xcite .",
    "the result , @xmath1 10@xmath2 @xmath3 s@xmath4 ( here and in the following one sigma statistical errors are combined in quadrature with systematical errors ) , is a factor three smaller than the ssm prediction of bahcall et al.@xcite : @xmath5    the cc reaction is sensitive exclusively to @xmath6 , while electron scattering ( es ) also has a small sensitivity to @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "comparison of @xmath9 to the super - kamiokande ( sk ) precision result on es yields a 3.3@xmath10 difference , providing evidence that there is a non - electron flavor active neutrino component in the solar flux .",
    "extraction of this flux , @xmath11 , can be done in a model independent way by exploiting the similarities of the response functions of sno and of sk , see @xcite . in this way",
    ", one determines from the two experiments the total active neutrino flux , @xmath12 , produced by @xmath0b decay in the sun @xcite : @xmath13    the close agreement with the theoretical prediction ( [ fibssm ] ) is an important confirmation of the robustness of ssm calculations , see table [ tabtc ] .",
    "actually , one can go somehow in more detail and use this experimental information to provide an independent estimate of the accuracy of several input parameters that are used in solar model calculations . among others",
    ", we shall consider the solar metal abundance , opacity and p - p fusion cross section .",
    "we shall also consider the central solar temperature .",
    "as well known , this is not an independent parameter , rather it is the result of solar model calculations , mainly dependent on the assumed values for metals , opacity and luminosity .",
    "the boron flux measurement essentially provides a measurement of the central solar temperature .",
    "so far we neglected the possibility of oscillations of @xmath6 into sterile neutrinos .",
    "in fact one can use the experimental result on active neutrinos @xmath14 and the theoretical prediction on the total flux , @xmath15 to provide an upper bound on the flux of sterile neutrinos on earth .    when connecting the @xmath0b flux with quantities characterizing the solar interior , an important link is provided by nuclear physics , through the nuclear cross sections of the processes which lead to @xmath0b production .",
    "we shall discuss the relevance of nuclear physics uncertainties in this respect .",
    "the neutrino flux from @xmath0b decay in the sun depends on several inputs @xmath16 , which can be grouped as nuclear and astrophysical parameters , see table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the first group contains the zero energy astrophysical s - factors for the reactions which are involved in the production of @xmath0b nuclei .",
    "@xmath17 refers to p+p@xmath18d+ e@xmath19 + @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 refer respectively to @xmath23he+@xmath23he @xmath24he+2p and to @xmath23he+@xmath25he @xmath18 @xmath26be+@xmath27 . once @xmath26be nuclei have been formed , the probability of forming a @xmath0b nucleus is essentially given by the ratio of proton to electron capture on @xmath26be , i.e on @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath0b neutrino flux depends on several astrophysical inputs .",
    "concerning the dependence on the solar luminosity @xmath29 and age @xmath30 , a more luminous sun requires a higher internal temperature , which implies a higher boron flux .",
    "an older sun is also a more luminous sun .    the metal content z / x determines opacity .",
    "if z / x increases , opacity increases and the radiative transfer of the solar luminosity requires higher temperature gradients , which in turn implies higher temperature and a larger @xmath0b flux",
    ".    opacity calculation are complex , and also for fixed metal content different codes yield ( slightly ) different opacities .",
    "for this reason we introduce , by means of a scaling parameter @xmath31 , the possibility of a uniform scaling of opacity in the solar interior .",
    "another scaling factor , d , is allowed for varying the calculated diffusion coefficients .    if these inputs are changed with respect to the values used in the ssm calculations , @xmath32 , the @xmath0b - neutrino flux @xmath33 changes according to a power law : @xmath34    we have calculated these coefficients by using solar models which include helium and heavy elements diffusion , see table [ tab1 ] .",
    "they are in agreement with the values calculated ( neglecting diffusion ) in @xcite ( see table [ tab1 ] ) and in @xcite",
    ".    most of these values can be understood by using simple , semi - quantitative arguments , see e.g. @xcite . as an example",
    ", one can easily show that at equilibrium the production of @xmath26be nuclei scales as @xmath35 @xcite and that the production of @xmath0b nuclei , which is a minor perturbation of the pp - ii chain , scales as @xmath28 .",
    "each input is affected by uncertainties .",
    "the values shown in table [ tab1 ] , 4-th row , correspond to one sigma percentage error .",
    "they have been obtained according to the following criteria :    \\i ) for the nuclear cross sections , we generally consider the values and uncertainties recommended in ref .",
    "@xcite which are quite similar to those quoted in ref .",
    "concerning @xmath36 , we quote an uncertainty of 9% , taking into account recent measurements @xcite .",
    "\\ii ) concerning solar luminosity , age and metals , we adopt the same uncertainties quoted in @xcite , which are derived by recent measurements of the solar constant , by a detailed comparison of meteorite radioactive datings and by analysis of meteoric and photospheric chemical compositions @xcite .",
    "\\iii ) regarding the opacity and diffusion uncertainties , there is no experimental guidance and one has to resort to the comparison among different theoretical calculations .",
    "a factor 2.5% is the typical difference between the calculated values of the livermore and los alamos opacities , see @xcite . concerning diffusion , bahcall and loeb @xcite quote and uncertainty of about 15% by comparing results of different theoretical calculations .",
    "( we have found that agreement with helioseismic information fixes diffusion to the level of 10% @xcite . )",
    "we also show in table [ tab1 ] , fifth line , the contributed fractional error , @xmath37 , i.e the contribution of each parameter to the error on the neutrino flux . summing up in quadrature ,",
    "the nuclear uncertainties yield an error on the flux @xmath38=13.3% , which matches closely the error resulting from astrophysical uncertainties calculated according to the same prescription , @xmath39=12.2% .",
    "all in all , the total calculated uncertainty , @xmath40 is about 18% , in agreement with ref .",
    "the experimental result , eq .",
    "( [ fibfogli ] ) , is in excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction , eq .",
    "( [ fibssm ] ) .",
    "the two determinations are affected by a similar error and , as we have just seen , the theoretical error gets comparable contributions form nuclear and astrophysical uncertainties .",
    "one can expect that in the future , with increasing statistics and with better understanding of the systematical uncertainties , the experimental error will be reduced , possibly by a factor of two . in view of this",
    ", one should improve the theoretical calculation by a comparable factor , which requires a better understanding of the nuclear physics and astrophysics which are involved , see again table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we remind that experiments are only sensitive to active neutrinos .",
    "the comparison with the ssm prediction can be used to derive an upper bound on the presence of sterile neutrinos , by requiring that @xmath41 .",
    "this gives : @xmath42    improvement of this bound will require that both theoretical and experimental determinations become more accurate .    neglecting the possibility of sterile neutrinos , one can use the @xmath0b - flux measurement as an independent way of estimating the accuracy of several nuclear and astrophysical parameters .",
    "in fact , the measurement of @xmath33 can be interpreted as a way of determining each of the parameters listed in table [ tab1 ] , by means of : @xmath43 in this way the measurement of @xmath33 together with the independent information on @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) can be translated into a mesurement of @xmath16 .    for each parameter in table [ tab1 ] , we have estimated the corresponding accuracy by taking into account the @xmath0b result and the uncertainty on all other parameters , in turn .",
    "the resulting values , @xmath46    are listed in table [ tab1 ] , last row .",
    "we remark the following points :    * the opacity scaling factor @xmath31 is determined to be unity with an accuracy of 9.3% .",
    "this is somehow worse than the estimated input accuracy of 2.6% .",
    "we remind however that this uncertainty was essentially estimated form the comparison between two different theoretical calculations .",
    "* the metal content z / x is confirmed within 18% .",
    "again this is worse than the estimated input uncertainty ( 6.1% ) from studies of solar photosphere , which however might not be representative of the metal content of the solar interior if it has been enriched in metals after the sun formation . *",
    "the astrophysical @xmath47-factor for the pp fusion reaction , @xmath17 , is determined wih accuracy of 9% .",
    "this quantity is not measured and it is the result of theoretical errors .",
    "the estimated uncertainty of these calculations (  input error \" ) is 1.7% helioseismology allows a few per cent accuracy @xcite . *",
    "the errors on @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath48 , @xmath36 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are not competitive with more direct measurements in the literature .",
    "a final remark concerns the accuracy of the central solar temperature @xmath49 ( see table [ tabtc ] for theoretical predictions of @xmath49 ) .",
    "solar model builders have been claiming for decades that @xmath49 is known with an accuracy of one per cent or better .",
    "helioseismology has provided strong support to this finding . although helioseismology measures sound speed and not temperature , consistency with helioseismic data has been found only for solar models which produce @xmath49 within one percent of the ssm prediction @xcite .",
    "the measurement of @xmath0b provides an important test in this respect .",
    "in fact , the temperature is not an independent variable .",
    "its precise value is determined by some of the parameters which we have been discussing : the cross section for the pp - reaction , the metal content of the sun , the adopted values for the radiative opacity , the solar age and luminosity and also the diffusion coefficients .",
    "on the other hand , the central temperature is not affected by the other nuclear parameters listed in table [ tab1 ] . in full generality , the relationship between the boron flux and @xmath49 is ( see @xcite ) : @xmath50 where @xmath51 includes the dependence on the nuclear cross sections        concerning the exponent @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ fitc ] ) , it is weakly dependent on which parameter is being varied for obtaining a changement of @xmath49 .",
    "we have calculated the exponent by using solar models which include helium and heavy elements diffusion , see table [ tabeta ] and fig .",
    "[ figbeta ] . on these grounds",
    "we will take @xmath54 .",
    "we remark that if one neglects diffusion , slightly higher values of @xmath53 are obtained , see table [ tabeta ] last column .",
    "in fact in ref .",
    "@xcite by studying solar models without diffusion a somehow higher value was found , @xmath55 .",
    "anyhow the choice of a slightly different value dos not induce a significant difference in the conclusions .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment on @xmath33 thus implies that the central temperature of the sun agrees with the ssm prediction to within one per cent : @xmath56 where the error gets comparable contributions from the uncertainty on @xmath33 and from nuclear physics ."
