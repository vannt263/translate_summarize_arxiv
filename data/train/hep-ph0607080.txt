    "in two previous papers @xcite , we presented the results of a new evaluation of the electromagnetic ( em ) corrections which have to be applied in a phase - shift analysis ( psa ) of the @xmath0 elastic - scattering data at low energies ( pion laboratory kinetic energy @xmath15 mev ) in order to extract the hadronic phase shifts .",
    "the calculation used relativised schrdinger equations containing the sum of an em and a hadronic potential ; the hadronic potential was assumed to be isospin invariant .",
    "we gave reasons for accepting the new corrections as more reliable than the ones obtained by the nordita group @xcite in the late 1970s .",
    "for the @xmath16 scattering data , the corrections @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the @xmath8 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 waves are given in table 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite . for the @xmath10 scattering data ,",
    "the corrections @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are listed in tables 1 - 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper , we present the results of a psa of the @xmath0 elastic - scattering data for @xmath25 mev which was performed using these new em corrections .",
    "we have imposed two important restrictions on the experimental data .",
    "first , in contrast to the karlsruhe analyses @xcite and to the modern gwu ( formerly , vpi ) solutions @xcite , we have chosen to analyse the elastic - scattering data separately . there is an important reason for this decision . as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , what we called hadronic potentials ( in those papers ) are not the purely hadronic potentials which model the hadronic dynamics in the absence of the em interaction ; they contain residual em effects , and we henceforth call them ` electromagnetically modified ' ( em - modified , for short ) hadronic potentials . on page @xmath26 of ref .",
    "@xcite and page @xmath27 of ref .",
    "@xcite , we explained that we were not attempting to calculate corrections which would remove these residual effects .",
    "the corrections calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite lead to an em - modified hadronic situation , for which there is evidence that isospin invariance is violated @xcite .",
    "it is known that , provided that this violation is reasonably small , it is still possible to analyse the @xmath10 elastic - scattering data in a framework of formal isospin invariance , borrowing the @xmath28 hadronic phase shifts from an analysis of @xmath16 scattering data and then obtaining the @xmath29 hadronic phase shifts from an analysis of @xmath10 elastic - scattering data . in the present paper ,",
    "we therefore retain the framework of formal isospin invariance of refs .",
    "this approach enables us to directly investigate the violation of isospin invariance by using the output of our psa to examine the reproduction of the experimental data for the charge - exchange ( cx ) reaction @xmath30 .",
    "the second important restriction concerns the energy limitation @xmath15 mev .",
    "we think that it is important to analyse this body of data separately , and _ then _ to compare the output of the analysis with that of works which use the entire pion - nucleon ( @xmath13 ) database as input @xcite , or with the result for the @xmath8-wave threshold parameter @xmath31 for @xmath10 elastic scattering deduced from pionic hydrogen @xcite .",
    "there is now an abundance of data for @xmath15 mev from experiments carried out at pion factories , and these data alone are sufficient to determine the @xmath8- and @xmath9-wave hadronic phase shifts reliably , as well as the low - energy constants characterising the @xmath13 interaction near threshold .",
    "if data from higher energies are included in an analysis , and scaling ( floating ) of the differential - cross - section ( dcs ) measurements is allowed , there is the possibility of a systematic rescaling of the low - energy data in order to match the behaviour of the partial - wave amplitudes obtained from the higher energies , resulting in scale factors for the low - energy experiments whose average is significantly different from the expected value of @xmath32 . in our work",
    ", it has been verified that the scale factors are not energy dependent and that their average values ( for the two elastic - scattering processes , separately analysed ) are close to @xmath32 .",
    "implementation of a psa always involves a decision on where to truncate the partial - wave expansion of the scattering amplitudes . for @xmath25 mev , it is sufficient to retain terms up to @xmath33 . in this region ,",
    "the @xmath12- and @xmath34-wave hadronic phase shifts are very small and their em corrections negligible .",
    "nevertheless , these phase shifts need to be included ; although their presence does not improve the quality of the fit , it induces small changes in the output @xmath8 and @xmath9 waves .",
    "since in the gwu analysis @xcite , which incorporates dispersion - relation constraints , the @xmath12 and @xmath34 waves are determined reliably in the region @xmath35 mev , we decided to use their solution .",
    "as previously mentioned , the sensitivity of the output @xmath8- and @xmath9-wave hadronic phase shifts to a variation of the @xmath12 and @xmath34 waves is small ; hence , the uncertainties due to the @xmath12- and @xmath34-wave hadronic phase shifts are of no importance when compared to the ones associated with the experimental data being fitted .    before giving a description of the rest of this paper , we comment on our use of em corrections which are not complete ( stage 1 corrections ) , but leave em effects in the hadronic interaction , which require further ( stage 2 ) corrections .",
    "stage 1 corrections , which we have calculated nonperturbatively using a potential model , are reliable estimates of the effects of the coulomb interaction and , in the case of @xmath10 scattering , of the external mass differences and the @xmath36 channel .",
    "they are not superseded by field theoretical estimates of the stage 2 corrections , which take account of diagrams with internal photon lines and of mass differences in intermediate states .",
    "the only reliable calculation of stage 2 corrections has been made in ref .",
    "@xcite for the parameter @xmath31 , using chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a variant version of chpt is used to take account of the full effect of the em interaction on the analysis of @xmath13 scattering data .",
    "the authors use only a small amount of experimental data , for @xmath37 mev .",
    "numerical values for em corrections and @xmath8-wave scattering lengths are not given .",
    "from the solid curve for the @xmath10 elastic - scattering @xmath8-wave ` phase shift ' in fig .",
    "@xmath38 of ref .",
    "@xcite , one can deduce a value of about @xmath39 fm for @xmath31 ; this number increases to about @xmath40 fm , if part of the em correction is not taken into account ( dashed curve in their fig .",
    "@xmath38 ) .",
    "it is hard to assess what one can learn from these two numbers . to start with",
    ", a factor of @xmath41 hardly represents a correction .",
    "further , starting from the latest experimental result of ref .",
    "@xcite on pionic hydrogen , and taking account of the em correction calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , a value of @xmath42 fm is obtained for @xmath31 , with an error of about @xmath43 fm .",
    "there is clearly a very big disagreement between this result and that of ref .",
    "@xcite .    for low - energy @xmath13 physics , the extension of the work of ref .",
    "@xcite to other threshold parameters and ultimately to the calculation of stage 2 corrections at nonzero energies is needed . until such calculations exist , there is no choice but to work with the stage 1 corrections given in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "section 2 sets out the formalism which establishes the connection between the em - modified hadronic phase shifts and the observables which are subject to experimentation .",
    "this involves a lengthy chain of connections ; to avoid constant reference to various sources of equations , we have decided to keep the formalism largely self - contained .",
    "section 3 lists the experiments in the databases for @xmath44 elastic scattering and discusses the treatment of the statistical and normalisation uncertainties for the various experiments . for both @xmath16 and @xmath10 elastic scattering , the databases consisted mostly of experimental results for the dcs and the analysing power , measured at a series of angles for energies between @xmath45 and @xmath1 mev .",
    "in addition , for @xmath16 , we used measurements of partial - total and total ( called total - nuclear in the past ) cross sections at a number of energies .",
    "our aim in this psa was to reject as few measurements as possible ; whole experiments were removed only when it was beyond doubt that their angular distribution had a shape incompatible with the bulk of the data .",
    "the optimisation method used required , in addition to the statistical errors on the individual data points , the normalisation error of each data set . in the case of cross sections ,",
    "the normalisation error arises from uncertainties in the beam flux and target thickness , and , in the case of analysing powers , from the uncertainty in the degree of polarisation of the target .",
    "there are a few experiments where the normalisation error has not been properly reported ; in order to treat all experiments on an equal basis , it was necessary to assign normalisation errors to all such experiments .    in section 4 , we discuss the statistical procedure followed and the way in which the outliers were identified and removed from the databases . in order to reject the smallest possible amount of experimental information ,",
    "simple expansions of the @xmath8- and @xmath9-wave @xmath46-matrix elements were assumed ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; these expansions contain three parameters for each @xmath8-wave and two for each @xmath9-wave hadronic phase shift , thus making seven parameters in all for each value of the total isospin @xmath47 . in order to determine the seven parameters corresponding to the @xmath28 hadronic phase shifts ,",
    "the @xmath16 elastic - scattering data were fitted first .",
    "the arndt - roper formula @xcite was used in the optimisation .",
    "we will explain in detail how the data sets were tested for bad shape and normalisation .",
    "consistent with our aim of rejecting as few data as possible , a mild @xmath48 was adopted as the significance level for rejection , instead of the more standard ( among statisticians ) value of @xmath49 . in the statistical sense",
    ", @xmath48 corresponds to a @xmath50 effect for the normal distribution .",
    "it was necessary to remove only two data sets from the @xmath16 database , and to float two sets freely ( due to their bad normalisation ) .",
    "two sets could be saved by removing just one point from each set , and a third one was saved by removing two points .",
    "we had to reject just @xmath51 degrees of freedom out of a total of @xmath52 .",
    "after the completion of the analysis of the @xmath16 database , the @xmath10 elastic - scattering database was analysed , using the @xmath28 hadronic phase shifts obtained from the @xmath16 reaction ; the seven parameters for the @xmath29 hadronic phase shifts were thus obtained .",
    "the same tests for bad shape and normalisation were performed . in this case , just one data set had to be removed , one set was freely floated , and a single point had to be removed from each of two data sets . there were just @xmath53 rejected degrees of freedom out of a total of @xmath54 . after the completion of the two seven - parameter fits and the removal of the outliers , we combined the two truncated elastic - scattering databases , to form a single database to be used in the rest of our work .    in section 5 , we make use of a low - energy @xmath13 model which was described in ref .",
    "@xcite and developed further in ref .",
    "this model is based on @xmath2 and @xmath3 s- and u - channel graphs , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 t - channel exchanges .",
    "the model incorporates the important constraints imposed by crossing symmetry .",
    "there are now just seven adjustable parameters for fitting the combined truncated elastic - scattering database ( @xmath55 degrees of freedom in @xmath16 , @xmath56 in @xmath10 ) .",
    "the fit using the model results in @xmath57 ( ndf stands for the number of degrees of freedom ) , compared to @xmath58 for the @xmath59-parameter fit .",
    "one has to remark that even the latter fit is poor by conventional statistical standards . however , there are two points to make here .",
    "one is that the use of the more restrictive @xmath13 model does not make the fit much worse .",
    "the second is that , in order to obtain what would usually be considered an acceptable fit , the significance level for rejection of points would need to be raised to around @xmath60 , with a consequent drastic reduction of the database from @xmath61 to @xmath62 entries .",
    "the remarkable thing , however , is that the output values of the model parameters are very little affected by this dramatic change in the significance level .",
    "this leads to considerable confidence in the reliability and stability of the model in fitting the combined truncated elastic - scattering database .",
    "it seems to us very likely that , for many of the experiments , there has been a substantial underestimation of both the statistical and normalisation errors .",
    "we therefore think that the best strategy is to work with the low significance level of @xmath48 , thus rejecting as few data as possible , and to include the birge factor @xmath63 in the uncertainties obtained for the model parameters , thus adjusting them for the quality of the fit .    in section 6",
    ", we present our results for the em - modified hadronic phase shifts ( in the form of a table and figures ) , as well as for the @xmath8-wave scattering lengths and @xmath9-wave scattering volumes .",
    "we shall compare our results with those from the gwu analysis @xcite and point out where the differences lie .",
    "we shall also compare the values of the parameter @xmath31 obtained from the scattering lengths given by our psa and from refs .",

    "since the energy resolution of experiments is only rarely reported , we made the same decision as everyone else involved in analyses of low - energy @xmath13 data , namely , to put the factors @xmath153 to @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath16 database comprises the following measurements : dcs @xcite-@xcite , analysing powers @xcite , partial - total cross sections @xcite and total cross sections @xcite .",
    "the auld79 experiment @xcite gave only statistical errors on the data points and did not report an overall normalisation uncertainty ; we assigned a normalisation error of @xmath154 based on a least - squares fit to the quoted meson - factory normalisation errors for the experiments @xcite-@xcite . due to the fact that two different targets were used",
    ", the brack88 data @xcite were assumed to comprise two independent experiments performed at the same energy ( @xmath155 mev ) .",
    "the analysing - power experiment of wieser96 @xcite used two separate targets with different degrees of polarisation .",
    "we therefore separated the data from this experiment into two data sets , one with three points and one with four .",
    "for this experiment ( as well as for that of sevior89 @xcite ) , a normalisation uncertainty of @xmath156 was assigned ; this value represents twice the normalisation error of the recent experiment of patterson02 @xcite which measured the @xmath10 analysing power .",
    "it is hard to decide what to do with experiments for which the normalisation uncertainties were not properly reported . rather than discard them , we made a rough judgment that they should be included in the databases , and assigned normalisation errors which are twice those of comparable modern experiments , to take account of their lack of proper reporting and of the age of the experiments .",
    "as we note later , the exact assignment does not matter .",
    "the partial - total cross sections of kriss97 @xcite were obtained at 13 different energies from @xmath157 to @xmath158 mev . at each of these energies , the cross section for scattering into all ( laboratory ) angles exceeding @xmath159 was measured . at two energies ( @xmath160 and @xmath155 mev ) , the partial - total cross section for scattering into all angles @xmath161 was also measured , using the same beam and target .",
    "we therefore separated the data into 11 one - point sets and 2 two - point sets , thus giving @xmath162 data sets in all .",
    "the normalisation error on the data points was assumed to be @xmath163 ; this number appeared in the first report of the experiment .",
    "for the very similar friedman99 experiment @xcite , there are @xmath159 data at six energies and , in addition , @xmath164 data at three of the energies , obtained with the same beam and target .",
    "we thus separated the data into three one - point sets and three two - point sets , and assigned a normalisation uncertainty of @xmath165 .    the total cross sections of carter71 @xcite and pedroni78 @xcite were also included in the analysis , each data point being treated as a one - point set , with a total error obtained by combining in quadrature the reported errors with a normalisation uncertainty of @xmath165 , twice the corresponding error for the experiment of ref .",
    "the same remarks apply as for the analysing - power experiments discussed above .",
    "the complete initial @xmath16 database consisted of @xmath52 entries ; a normalisation uncertainty had to be assigned to @xmath166 entries in total .",
    "the smallness of this fraction ensures that the output of the analysis is practically insensitive to the precise values of the normalisation uncertainties assigned to these 39 measurements .",
    "there were @xmath167 data sets within the full database , @xmath168 for the dcs , @xmath169 for the analysing power and @xmath170 ( all one- or two - point sets ) for the partial - total and total cross sections .",
    "as already explained in section 1 , for the @xmath10 database we confined ourselves to elastic scattering only .",
    "the published @xmath10 partial - total and total cross sections can not be used , as they contain a large component from cx scattering ; the inclusion of these data in any part of the analysis would have cast doubt on any conclusions about the violation of isospin invariance .",
    "our database therefore consisted of measurements of the dcs @xcite , @xcite-@xcite and @xcite , and of the analysing power @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the experiment of janousch97 @xcite measured the dcs at a single angle ( @xmath171 in the cm frame ) at five energies ; the data were treated as five one - point experiments .",
    "the experiment of joram95 @xcite was considered to comprise eight separate data sets .",
    "data was taken at five energies , but , at the energies of @xmath172 and @xmath173 mev , the points at higher angles were obtained using a different target from the one used for lower angles ; the data obtained with these different targets were put in separate sets . only in the case of the analysing - power experiments alder83 @xcite and sevior89 @xcite",
    "did we have to assign a normalisation error , namely the @xmath156 value which was used in the case of the two @xmath16 analysing - power experiments .",
    "thus , the assignment of a normalisation uncertainty was necessary for only @xmath174 points out of @xmath54 . in the full database ,",
    "there were @xmath175 data sets ( @xmath176 for the dcs and @xmath177 for the analysing power ) .",
    "after our psa was completed , new experimental data appeared @xcite ; this consists of analysing - power measurements at energies between @xmath178 and @xmath179 mev , with @xmath170 data points for @xmath16 and @xmath169 for @xmath10 elastic scattering . for these measurements ,",
    "three different targets were used , for each of which there was a determination of the target polarisation ; therefore , the measurements must be assigned to just three data sets . in each of these sets ,",
    "the measurements correspond to more than one energy , and , in one case , to both @xmath16 and @xmath10 scattering .",
    "unfortunately , it has not been possible to include these data in our analysis .",
    "their inclusion would have involved substantial modifications in our database structure and analysis software as , at present , our data sets are characterised by a single energy and a single reaction type .",

    "the number of points in the full @xmath10 elastic - scattering database was @xmath54 and the minimum value of @xmath180 was @xmath260 for @xmath261 degrees of freedom .",

    "none were identified , thus satisfying us that the two truncated elastic - scattering databases are self - consistent and can be used as the starting point for further analysis . before proceeding further , three issues need to be addressed .",
    "first , judged solely on the basis of p - values , it appears that the two truncated databases ( that is , @xmath16 and @xmath10 ) are not of the same quality .",
    "however , there is a proper statistical measure of such a comparison between two quantities following the @xmath180 distribution . in order to prove that the two databases are of different quality ( that is , that they have not been sampled from the same distribution )",
    ", the ratio @xmath267 has to be significantly different from @xmath32 . in this formula ,",
    "the subscripts @xmath268 and @xmath269 denote the two scattering reactions .",
    "the ratio @xmath270 follows fisher s ( @xmath270 ) distribution . using the numbers which come from our optimal fits to the two databases separately",
    ", we obtain for @xmath270 the value of @xmath271 for @xmath272 and @xmath273 degrees of freedom . however , the lowest value of @xmath270 which would demonstrate a statistically significant effect ( at the @xmath274 confidence level ) for the given degrees of freedom is @xmath275 , well above the value @xmath271 .",
    "the p - value corresponding to this value of @xmath270 ( @xmath271 ) is about @xmath276 , far too large to indicate any significance .",
    "thus , there is no evidence that our two truncated elastic - scattering databases are of different quality .",
    "the second issue relates to the distribution of the residuals as they come out of the separate fits to the two databases .",
    "this is an issue which has to be carefully investigated in any optimisation procedure .",
    "for instance , pathological cases may result in asymmetrical distributions , usually created by large numbers of outliers or by the inability of the parametric model to account for the input measurements .",
    "if this is the case , the optimal values of the parameters obtained from the fit are bound to be wrong ; fortunately , this is not the case in our fits .",
    "if , on the other hand , the distribution of the residuals turns out to be symmetrical , it has to be investigated whether it corresponds to the form of the quantity chosen for the minimisation ; this is a necessary condition for the self - consistency of the optimisation scheme .",
    "the choice of @xmath180 must yield normal distributions of the residuals . for each of the databases",
    ", we found that the residuals were indeed distributed normally , with a mean of @xmath125 and almost identical standard deviations .",
    "it is important to understand one subtle point relating to the distribution of the residuals in low - energy @xmath13 elastic scattering . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this distribution was found to be lorentzian ; in the present work , the distribution of the residuals was normal .",
    "one might then erroneously conclude that the two analyses are in conflict ; in fact , there is none .",
    "the point is that no floating of the data sets was allowed in ref .",
    "@xcite ; for each data point , the normalisation uncertainty was combined in quadrature with the statistical one to yield an overall error .",
    "had we followed the same strategy in the present work , we would also have found lorentzian distributions .",
    "however , the floating introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chijsq ] ) transforms the lorentzian distributions into normal ; minimising the quantity defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chijsq ] ) leads to better clustering of the residuals because each data set is allowed to float as a whole .",
    "the final remark concerns the scale factors @xmath187 obtained in the fits , as listed in tables [ tab:1-table ] and [ tab:2-table ] . for a satisfactory fit , the data sets which have to be scaled ` upwards ' should ( more or less ) be balanced by the ones which have to be scaled ` downwards ' .",
    "additionally , the energy dependence of the scale factors over the energy range of the analysis should not be significant .",
    "if these prerequisites are not fulfilled , the parametric forms used in the fits can not adequately reproduce the data over the entire energy range and biases are introduced into the analysis .",
    "for both the @xmath16 and @xmath10 dcs data , the values of @xmath187 which lie above and below @xmath32 roughly balance each other and there is no discernible energy dependence .",
    "there are too few analysing - power data to make a statement . for the @xmath16 partial - total and total cross sections , all the scale factors are above @xmath32 ; however , most of them cluster very close to @xmath32 and there is no significant energy dependence .",
    "it is interesting to note that when the p - values of the data sets listed in tables [ tab:1-table ] and [ tab:2-table ] are plotted as a function of the energy , for @xmath16 and @xmath10 separately , in neither case is there any evidence of a systematic behaviour . in other words",
    ", there is no subrange of the full @xmath45 to @xmath1 mev energy range for which the data is better or worse fitted than for the rest of the range .",
    "we believe that it is essential for any psa , over whatever energy range , to address the issues we have just considered in this section .",
    "having satisfied ourselves that we have self - consistent @xmath16 and @xmath10 elastic - scattering databases , no bias in the scale factors and an appropriate quantity to be minimised , we can proceed to analyse the combined truncated elastic - scattering database in the framework of the @xmath13 model of ref .",
    "since the analysis assumes a framework of formal isospin invariance for the hadronic phase shifts and threshold parameters , it is necessary to give the two elastic - scattering reactions equal weight .",
    "this was achieved by multiplying @xmath229 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : chijsq ] ) ) for each @xmath16 data set by @xmath277 and for each @xmath10 data set by @xmath278 with @xmath279 and @xmath280 ; we then added these quantities for all the data sets to obtain the overall @xmath180 value .",
    "the application of the overall weights for the two reactions was made as a matter of principle ; its effect on the psa is very small .      to extract the hadronic component of the @xmath13 interaction from experimental data , it is necessary to introduce a way to model the interaction .",
    "so far in this paper , we have used expansions of the hadronic phase shifts in terms of the energy . in a moment",
    ", we will use a model based on feynman diagrams .",
    "whatever the model , one must then introduce the em effects ( as contributions to the hadronic phase shifts and partial - wave amplitudes ) and use an optimisation procedure in which the model parameters are varied to achieve the best fit to the data",
    ". expansions of the hadronic phase shifts in terms of the energy , taking unitarity into account by using the @xmath46-matrix formalism , are general , but can not provide any insight into the physical processes involved . on the other hand ,",
    "the use of feynman diagrams involves a choice of the diagrams to be included in the model , but is able to yield an understanding of the dynamics of the @xmath13 interaction .",
    "models based on feynman diagrams suffer from two problems .",
    "first , while the diagrams are chosen to include the contributions of the significant processes involved in the interaction , there will always be small contributions which are omitted and are absorbed into the dominant ones .",
    "second , since the em - modified hadronic amplitudes are being approximated by forms which respect formal isospin invariance , it is necessary to assign single masses to each of the hadronic multiplets appearing in the model ( in our case , @xmath281 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "all this means that the model parameters ( coupling constants and vertex factors ) become effective , and that the amplitudes calculated from such models contain residual effects of em origin .",
    "the former is a reminder that the errors on the parameters derived from a fit to @xmath13 data will be underestimated . for the latter , we have already pointed out in section 1 that the hadronic phase shifts being modelled are modified by em effects which are not included in the calculation of the em corrections given in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in our evaluation of the em corrections and in the analysis of the @xmath0 elastic - scattering data using a @xmath13 model ,",
    "we have remained self - consistent by fixing the hadronic masses of pions and nucleons at @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "these are not the true hadronic masses .",
    "the hadronic masses of the pions and nucleons are discussed in ref .",
    "the hadronic masses of @xmath282 and @xmath283 are almost identical , and differ by at most @xmath32 mev from the physical mass @xmath284 of @xmath283 .",
    "the hadronic mass of the neutron is about @xmath41 mev greater than that of the proton , as a result of the difference between the masses of the @xmath11- and the @xmath12-quark .",
    "it is noteworthy , however , that the work of ref .",
    "@xcite concludes that , despite this mass difference , chpt for the hadronic @xmath13 interaction is to a good approximation isospin invariant , and characterised by single hadronic masses for the pions and nucleons . ref .",
    "@xcite makes the conventional choice of these hadronic masses as @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "this choice has been made in previous studies of the low - energy @xmath13 system @xcite-@xcite and we have retained it in the present work .",
    "this standard choice envisages what might be called a ` partially hadronic world ' , in which the @xmath13 interaction is isospin invariant , but the pion and nucleon masses are @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "it therefore needs to be borne in mind that the model - derived hadronic phase shifts given in the rest of this paper are not true hadronic quantities , but contain residual em contributions , due to the incompleteness of the em corrections and to the difference between the chosen hadronic masses and the true ones .",
    "since for the analysis of the @xmath0 elastic - scattering data we are using a framework of formal isospin invariance , the em - modified hadronic interaction has been modelled by using the parameterisation of ref .",
    "this model is isospin invariant and incorporates the important constraints of crossing symmetry and unitarity",
    ". the ability of the model to account for the bulk of the elastic - scattering data at least up to the @xmath3 resonance has been convincingly demonstrated .",
    "the main diagrams on which the model is based are graphs with scalar - isoscalar ( @xmath285 ) and vector - isovector ( @xmath286 ) t - channel exchanges , as well as the @xmath2 and @xmath3 s- and u - channel graphs .",
    "the main contributions to the partial - wave amplitudes from these diagrams have been given in detail in ref .",
    "the small contributions from the six well - established four - star @xmath8 and @xmath9 higher baryon resonances with masses up to @xmath41 gev were also included in the model ; in fact , the only such state with a significant contribution is the roper resonance .",
    "the tensor component of the @xmath285 t - channel exchange was added in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the @xmath285 t - channel contribution to the amplitudes is approximated in the model by a broad @xmath287 resonance , characterised by two parameters , @xmath288 and @xmath289 .",
    "its exact position has practically no effect on the description of the @xmath13 scattering data or on the fitted values of @xmath288 and @xmath289 , and for a long time has been fixed at @xmath290 mev .",
    "the @xmath286 t - channel contribution is described by the @xmath5-meson , with @xmath291 mev , which introduces two additional parameters , @xmath292 and @xmath293 .",
    "the contributions of the s- and u - channel graphs with an intermediate @xmath2 involve the @xmath294 coupling constant @xmath295 and one further parameter @xmath296 which represents the pseudoscalar admixture in the @xmath294 vertex ; for pure pseudovector coupling , @xmath297 .",
    "finally , the contributions of the graphs with an intermediate @xmath3 introduce the coupling constant @xmath298 and one additional parameter @xmath153 associated with the spin-@xmath299 admixture in the @xmath3 field .",
    "the higher baryon resonances do not introduce any parameters .",
    "when a fit to the data is made using all the eight parameters just described , it turns out that there is a strong correlation between @xmath288 , @xmath292 and @xmath296 , which makes it impossible to determine the values of all three quantities .",
    "one of the options available is to set @xmath296 to @xmath125 ; this choice is usually adopted in effective field - theoretical models of low - energy @xmath13 scattering .",
    "thus , seven parameters were used in the fit to the combined truncated elastic - scattering database : @xmath288 , @xmath289 , @xmath292 , @xmath293 , @xmath295 , @xmath298 and @xmath153 .      as described in section 4 ,",
    "the choice of the probability value below which points are removed from the databases is difficult and subjective . in order to reject as few points as possible",
    ", we adopted a very low value of @xmath217 ( @xmath266 , the value associated with @xmath228 effects ) . recognising the arbitrariness in the choice of @xmath217 , we consider that , in order to have confidence in the reliability of our analysis , it is necessary to check that the fitted values of the seven model parameters remain stable over a reasonably broad range of @xmath217 values .",
    "thus , in addition to @xmath266 , the analysis was performed with a database reduced by using @xmath217-value cuts of @xmath265 , @xmath300 and @xmath301 .",
    "the value of @xmath300 is close to a @xmath302 effect ; points rejected on this basis could reasonably be considered as sufficiently out - of - line to warrant this treatment .",
    "the value of @xmath303 is larger than anyone would reasonably choose ; however , it was interesting to investigate how our results could change in this rather extreme case .",
    "table [ tab:3-table ] shows the values of the seven parameters for the fits to databases selected using these four values of @xmath217 .",
    "the errors shown correspond to @xmath216 .",
    "in fact , when the errors are calculated with the factor @xmath63 included , they do not vary much with the value of @xmath217 . as @xmath217 increases , the database being fitted shrinks and so the raw errors increase .",
    "however , the factor @xmath63 decreases as the fit quality improves ( despite the decrease in @xmath304 ) and the two effects largely compensate .",
    "tab:3-table ] shows clearly the remarkable stability of the fit as the criterion for the rejection of data points is varied . in the case of @xmath292 ,",
    "the variation is approximately equal to the uncertainty in its determination . in the other six cases ,",
    "the variation is much smaller than the error .",
    "the quality of the fit , judged by standard statistical criteria , improves considerably as @xmath217 is increased , but at the cost of the loss of many points from the database . for @xmath216 , there are @xmath61 entries , @xmath305 and the p - value associated with this @xmath180 value is @xmath306 . at the other extreme , for @xmath307 , the database has shrunk to @xmath62 entries , the value of @xmath180 is @xmath308 and the associated p - value is @xmath309 .    faced with these results , one can conclude that the combined truncated elastic - scattering database , once the exceptionally bad points have been removed , is self - consistent and very robust when additional pruning is done .",
    "the output of the analysis is remarkably stable , which suggests that nearly all the measurements in the combined truncated elastic - scattering database of @xmath61 entries are reliable .",
    "the apparently poor quality of the fit does not seem to be the result of the presence of a substantial number of unreliable points , but rather of a general underestimation of the experimental uncertainties , both statistical and normalisation , particularly in the case of the dcs measurements .",
    "any attempt to alter the quoted errors would be arbitrary , so we must make judgments on the database as it stands .",
    "our judgment is that it is best to reject as few experimental points as possible , by using the value @xmath216 .",
    "we then have to live with a rather poor fit , which we have taken into account by increasing the uncertainties by the factor @xmath310 .",
    "all the results henceforth correspond to this fit .",
    "any uneasiness about this small value of @xmath217 should be put to rest by the observation that , for @xmath311 , the database is very little reduced ( a few @xmath16 points are removed ) and the output is practically unchanged .    the correlation matrix for the seven parameters of the @xmath13 model is given in table [ tab:4-table ] ; the numbers correspond to the fit with @xmath216 .",

    "the value of @xmath293 from our fit is problematic .",
    "it is quite small , and considerably larger values come from the study of nucleon form factors , @xmath321 scattering and deuteron photodisintegration . this difference may be a reflection of the strong correlations , already noted , between the contributions of the @xmath2- , @xmath3- and @xmath5-exchange processes , or it may be due to the omission of contributions whose effect is mainly compensated by a shift in the value of @xmath293 . in either case , it is clear that one must adopt a cautious attitude to the values of effective parameters obtained using hadronic models .",
    "( the same applies to boson exchange models of @xmath321 scattering . )    for the @xmath3 contribution , the values of @xmath298 and @xmath153 are very stable .",

    "inspection of the scale factors @xmath187 in tables [ tab:1-table ] and [ tab:2-table ] for the eight data sets shows that a decision to freely float the frank83 data sets is neither called for nor suggested in our analysis .",
    "we therefore made the decision to accept these data sets at their face value , as we did for all the other elastic - scattering measurements .",
    "in fact , when our analysis is repeated , with the only change being the free floating of the frank83 data sets , the value of @xmath336 changes by only a very small amount , to @xmath339 @xmath338 .",
    "we have tested the effect of one modification to the database .",
    "assuming that the normalisation uncertainties of most of the experiments may have been underestimated , we doubled them all .",
    "however , the fit then became unstable and it was impossible to obtain reliable results .",
    "there seems to be a delicate balance between the statistical and the normalisation errors which makes a stable fit possible .",
    "we hope in time to explore more sophisticated ways of selectively modifying the database , but the definitive resolution of the present discrepancy may require a reappraisal by experimenters of the whole body of low - energy elastic - scattering data .    because of the violation of isospin invariance in the em - modified hadronic interaction ( see next section ) , it is important to give also the results for the @xmath8-wave scattering length and @xmath9-wave scattering volumes obtained from the analysis of the truncated @xmath16 database alone ( table [ tab:1-table ] ) , using the parametric forms in eqs .",

    "<S> we found that it was possible to obtain self - consistent databases by removing very few measurements . a pion - nucleon model , based on s- and u - channel diagrams with @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the intermediate states , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 t - channel exchanges , was fitted to the elastic - scattering database obtained after the removal of the outliers . </S>",
    "<S> the model - parameter values showed an impressive stability when the database was subjected to different criteria for the rejection of experiments . </S>",

    "<S> big differences in the @xmath8-wave part of the interaction were observed when comparing our hadronic phase shifts with those of the current gwu solution . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the hadronic phase shifts obtained from the analysis of the elastic - scattering data can not reproduce the measurements of the @xmath10 charge - exchange reaction , thus corroborating past evidence that the hadronic interaction violates isospin invariance . assuming the validity of the result obtained within the framework of chiral perturbation theory , that the mass difference between the @xmath11- and the @xmath12-quark has only a very small effect on the isospin invariance of the purely hadronic interaction , the isospin - invariance violation revealed by the data must arise from the fact that we are dealing with a hadronic interaction which still contains residual effects of electromagnetic origin . </S>",
