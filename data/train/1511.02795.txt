    "during the last years , investigation of nanostructures experiences great development .",
    "they are good materials for constructing computer electronic devices , but their unique chemical and mechanical properties promise a wide application in many mutually different branches . the hexagonal carbon lattice structure and its variations are responsible for all of these extraordinary phenomena .    in the passed years",
    ", the basic forms of the nanostructures were investigated : the fullerene , graphene , nanotubes , nanohorns , nanocones , nanowires , etc .",
    "now , the steps are implemented for the preparation of more complicated forms like the wormhole @xcite and for the description of the electronic peculiarities of this type of structure .",
    "due to the repulsion forces between the carbon atoms on the different graphene sheets , it seemed to be very difficult to pursue this problem on a different than the theoretical basis .",
    "however , the progress of the laboratory methods promises to get good results in this field .",
    "the presence of the wormholes in the synthesized structures could be proven by the detection of the zero energy modes of the fermions in the places of the wormhole bridges .",
    "the electronic properties of the nanostructures are among others determined by their geometry , which is given by the presence of the defects @xcite .",
    "however , the deformation of the molecules can also be achieved mechanically or by the thermal influence . in the case of the former we speak about the so - called `` straintronics '' - the origin of the electronic structure comes from the mechanical strain affecting the molecule .",
    "this is exactly a new window to the world of nanostructures and devices similarly as was `` spintronics '' a decade ago .",
    "moreover , klein tunneling and cone transport in aa - stacked bilayer graphene give raise to the possibility of cone - tronic devices based on aa - stacked blg @xcite .    in the case of the wormhole ,",
    "the geometry can also cause a shift of the fermi energy at different distances from the wormhole center , which could direct the electron flux to this center , and in this way , the electric charge could be accumulated .",
    "the extraordinary deformation of the wormhole structures could highly influence the character of the fermi velocity , relativistic effects could appear in these conditions .",
    "first of all , it could significantly change the mass of fermions which are usually considered to be massless .",
    "another effect which could significantly influence the character of fermions is the spin - orbit coupling or interaction ( soc ) for the fermions located in the carbon nanotube .",
    "we will show that the strength of this interaction strongly depends on the radius of the nanotube , it should be inversely proportional to this radius . as a result , the chiral ( massive ) fermions should be detected around the wormhole bridge .",
    "this paper is an extension of work @xcite . here",
    ", we investigate the graphitic wormhole : we calculate its electronic structure and zero modes and look through the corrections coming from the relativistic effects and the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "similar calculations of the electronic structure and the zero modes will be carried out for the perturbed wormhole .",
    "furthermore , we will predict the effect of the graphene blackhole for this case . +",
    "the electronic structure can be characterized by the local density of states ( @xmath0 ) which gives the number of the electronic states per unit interval of energies and per the unit area of the molecular surface .",
    "the reason is an intuitive assumption that there exists a direct connection between this quantity and the electronic conductivity . for its calculation , in the case of the wormhole and the perturbed wormhole , we use the continuum gauge field - theory .    in the continuum gauge field - theory",
    ", we consider the continuum approach of the carbon lattice @xcite .",
    "so at each point of the molecular surface we take into the account the influence of different gauge fields and we insert them into the dirac - like equation for the electron .",
    "it has the form @xmath1\\psi = e\\psi,\\ ] ] in which the different terms have the meaning of different kinds of properties .",
    "the matrices @xmath2 which represent the @xmath3 matrices , which are used for the @xmath4-component case , have the form of the pauli matrices .",
    "the fermi velocity @xmath5 , the spin connection @xmath6,\\ ] ] and the covariant derivative @xmath7 are connected with the metric .",
    "next , the gauge fields @xmath8 ensure the continuation of the wave function with respect to the angular coordinate , and they are caused by the presence of the defects and by the rotational symmetry , respectively .",
    "the gauge field @xmath9 characterizes the possible magnetic field .",
    "the wave function has two components : @xmath10 where @xmath11 correspond to inequivalent sublattices of the hexagonal plane .",
    "the solution is found by using the substitution @xmath12{g_{\\varphi\\varphi}}}\\left(\\begin{array}{c}u_j(\\xi)e^{i\\varphi j}\\\\ v_j(\\xi)e^{i\\varphi(j+1)}\\\\\\end{array}\\right),\\hspace{2.5 mm } j=0,\\pm 1, ... ,\\ ] ] so @xmath13 where @xmath14 @xmath15 are the metric coefficients and @xmath16 is the angular momentum .",
    "then , if @xmath17 are the normalized solutions , the local density of states can be calculated as @xmath18 +",
    "the wormhole ( fig . [ fgworm ] ) is usually understood as a form which arises when two graphene sheets are connected together with the help of the connecting nanotube @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved by the supply of 2 sets of 6 heptagonal defects onto both sides of the given nanotube .",
    "of course , this brings the restrictions on the form of the nanotube - the chirality must be @xmath19 armchair or @xmath20 zig - zag . furthermore , because of the physical limitations , the radius of the nanotube must be much larger than its length .",
    "+ the metric tensor of the wormhole has the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the heaviside step function , @xmath23 are the polar coordinates corresponding to the lower and upper graphene sheet , respectively and @xmath24 is the radius of the wormhole .",
    "+      now the solution of the dirac equation will be found for the case of the wormhole . in this case",
    ", we use the form of the metric used in ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "next , the effective flux caused by the presence of the defects is included in the gauge field @xmath25 and for the particular polar components it has the values @xmath26 for these two possibilities : the first corresponds to the case when the chiral vector has the form @xmath27 , the second corresponds to the case when the chiral vector has the form @xmath28 with @xmath29 divisible by @xmath30 . in the case of the chiral vector of the form @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is not divisible by @xmath30 , the components of the corresponding gauge field have the form @xmath31 regarding that the components of the spin connection are @xmath32 and after the substitution into ( [ dirac ] ) we get the equation @xmath33 where each sign corresponds to a different dirac point .",
    "concretely , @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 . for @xmath35 ,",
    "the solution is @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the bessel functions and the energy @xmath41 .",
    "the local density of states for different values of the component of the gauge field @xmath42 is seen in fig .",
    "[ fg1 ] . + in fig .",
    "[ fgdv ] , we can see the local density of states at different distances from the wormhole bridge .",
    "+      the zero modes solve the dirac equation for the zero energy .",
    "if we choose the component @xmath43 of the solution to be equal to zero , we get from ( [ geq ] ) , ( [ leq ] ) @xmath44 for @xmath35 and @xmath45 for @xmath37 . for @xmath46 and the value @xmath47",
    ", it has the solution @xmath48 for @xmath35 and @xmath49 for @xmath37 .",
    "it is both strictly normalizable only for @xmath50 , so this is the only solution . in a similar way , we can calculate the zero modes for the component @xmath51 .",
    "we get analogical solution for @xmath43 if we choose the component @xmath52 of the solution to be equal to zero .    for the value @xmath53 , possible solutions are not strictly normalizable .",
    "so the zero modes exist only for the case of the connecting nanotube being armchair or zig - zag with the chiral vector @xmath28 , @xmath29 divisible by @xmath30 . in other cases ,",
    "the zero modes do not exist . + figure [ fg2]a shows very big localization of the @xmath0 near fermi energy on the bridge of the wormhole ( in comparison with the @xmath0 of the plane graphene ) .",
    "this big localization or singularity for zero mode solutions could be experimentally observed . in fig .",
    "[ fg2]b , the comparison of the zero modes of the wormhole and the graphene is plotted .",
    "recently , in work @xcite some peculiarities in the bilayer graphene were analytically predicted . a possible indication of the wormhole could be found in @xcite , where a new type of zero modes is investigated .",
    "these zero modes could be the zero modes studied in this subsection applied to the case of the smallest wormhole .",
    "+      in the continuum gauge field - theory , we suppose that the fermions appearing in the dirac equation have the zero mass , or more precisely , the mass is very small in comparison with the energy .",
    "but it was shown in @xcite that the fermi velocity changes and needs to be renormalized due to the elasticity and the deformations in graphene . in the investigated case of the graphitic wormhole , which is very specific because of the big deformations , the velocity of the fermions close to the wormhole bridge could achieve such values that the relativistic effects can appear or break off the symmetry @xcite .",
    "the result is that the mass of fermions would be non - negligible .",
    "( the same situation is also for the graphene bilayer where especially massive particles are predicted , see @xcite . )",
    "moreover , the radius of the wormhole and its bridge is very small in comparison with the size of the upper and the lower graphene sheet , and by folding the sheet into a tube they acquire nonzero effective mass as they move along the tube axis .",
    "this change of the space topology of graphene from 2d to 1d space compactification is similar to the string theory compactification .",
    "it means that we can image a wormhole connecting nanotubes as the 1d object .",
    "this indicates a necessity to incorporate a term containing the value of the mass into the dirac equation ( [ dirac ] ) . for the purpose of the derivation of the possible solution of this question",
    ", we go through the system of equations ( [ system ] ) , which can be transformed into the differential equation of the second order @xmath54 for the purpose of simplification , we will suppose the cylindrical geometry , i.e. the radius vector of the point at the surface will have the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the radius of the cylinder . in this case ,",
    "the form of equation ( [ secord ] ) will be changed into @xmath57 the solution of this equation has the form @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 from @xcite follows that a similar form has the dispersion relation associated with the massive 1d dirac equation : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the mass of the corresponding fermion .",
    "it is proven in @xcite that indeed , for a suitable choice of the parameters , the 2d massless case is analogous to the 1d massive case .",
    "this serves as an impulse to rewrite equation ( [ secord ] ) in the form @xmath62 where @xmath61 is the mass of the corresponding fermion .",
    "then , for different values of @xmath61 , we can find the corrections of the @xmath0 for the graphitic wormhole . for different distances from the wormhole bridge",
    ", we can see these corrections in fig .",
    "[ fgmass ] .",
    "we predict that these massive particles arising in the wormhole nanotubes could create energy bulks on the wormhole bridge and near the wormhole bridge which should be experimentally measured by the stm or raman spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "another possibility to identify the wormhole structure comes from the fact that the massive particles could create strain solitons and topological defects on the bridge of the bilayer graphene which should propagate throughout the graphene sheet .",
    "these are almost macroscopic effects and should be caught by the experimentalists @xcite .",
    "+      an important measurable quantity in the carbon nanostructures ( including the nanotubular part of the graphitic wormhole ) is the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) @xcite .",
    "considering this influence , the 2-component dirac equation is changed into the usual 4-component form . as a consequence",
    ", the chiral fermions should be detected close to the wormhole bridge .",
    "we will show that the smaller is the radius of the wormhole bridge , the stronger this effect should be .",
    "+ we have 2 sources of the soc : the first , the interatomic one that preserves the @xmath63-component of the spin and the second , the so - called rashba - type coming from the external electric field , which conserves the @xmath63-component of the angular momentum @xmath64 . in both cases , the strength of the soc is influenced by the nonzero curvature . here , we will be interested in the first , interatomic source of the soc .    considering the soc we can write the dirac equation for the nanotube in the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 the expression @xmath67 has the form @xmath68 where @xmath69 next , @xmath70 @xmath71 being the length of the atomic bond , @xmath72 are the hopping integrals for the @xmath73 and @xmath74 bond , respectively .    for the interatomic source of the soc we have @xmath75 with the difference of the energies of the relevant @xmath74 and @xmath73 orbitals @xmath76 @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the local coordinates . by applying the transformation @xmath79 with @xmath80 the transformed hamiltonian @xmath81 will has the form",
    "@xmath83 @xmath84 where @xmath85 corresponds to the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the operators @xmath86 are the pauli matrices , which transform the wave function of the @xmath87 sublattice into the wave function of the @xmath88 sublattice and vice versa .    in our model ,",
    "the soc is induced by the curvature and is described with the aid of two strength parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 which have , in the case of the single wall carbon nanotube with different magnitude , the form @xmath91 here , @xmath92 and for @xmath93 , both strengths go to infinity , as we required .",
    "+ so reminding the results of the previous section , the chiral massive fermions should be detected around the wormhole bridge .",
    "the presented strength constants @xmath94 for the soc as well as the dirac - like equation ( [ massdir ] ) for the massive fermions have not yet been published anywhere . + more complicated forms can arise : the nanotube in the wormhole center can be perturbed",
    ". then , the geometry of the corresponding graphene sheets will be curved and this brings a significant change of the physical properties .",
    "we speak about the perturbed wormhole .",
    "the wormhole is composed of 2 different kinds of nanostructures : the graphene and the nanotube .",
    "these two parts are connected with the help of 12 heptagonal defects .",
    "however , we can ask a question what happens if the number of the defects varies between 0 and 12 . then",
    ", the cases of 0 defects ( the nanotube ) and 12 defects ( the wormhole ) will be the limiting possibilities .",
    "the structure that arises in other cases will be called the perturbed wormhole .",
    "+ possible forms of the perturbed wormhole ( with the defects located in the middle ) can be seen in fig .",

    "the composition of the perturbed wormhole is depicted in fig .",
    "[ compworm ] : it consists of the unperturbed connecting nanotube and 2 perturbed graphene sheets .",

    "we see the graph of the local density of states in fig .",
    "+ in the case of more than 2 defects , the value of @xmath96 is non - negligible and we can get only numerical approximation of the @xmath0 . the derivation of the value of the parameter @xmath96 follows from fig .",

    "+ in the middle section , the upper branch of the graphene sheet converges to the line @xmath108 , where we can suppose that the angle @xmath109 depends on the number of the defects @xmath110 linearly , i.e. @xmath111 .",

    ", the massive fermions could also appear in the case of the perturbed wormhole .",
    "we will not perform a detailed derivation of the electronic structure for the case of this eventuality and we will only note that the corrections to the @xmath0 would be an analogy of the corrections shown in fig .",

    ", the electron flux is directed from these areas to the middle where the electric charge is accumulated . in the case of the deformed wormhole we speak about the so - called graphene blackhole .",
    "the form of the nanotube in the middle plays a big role for this purpose .",
    "it can not be unperturbed because in such a case the effect of the blackhole would be disrupted .",
    "it can be ensured only in the case when the nanotubular neck is tapering in the direction to its center , because this ensures the decrease of the fermi level @xcite .",
    "the related effects appearing on the nanostructures are also described in @xcite . here ,",
    "the special relativistic - like properties of the beltrami pseudosphere naturally point to quantum field theory in curved space .",
    "it predicts the finite temperature local density of states that is a realization of the hawking - unruh effect .",
    "the effect of the graphene blackhole could eventually disappear in the presence of the external magnetic ( electric ) field which would cause the transfer of the charge from one of the wormhole sheets to another through the center .",
    "this serves as an important model for further investigations of the electron flux in the presence of the defects . in @xcite , some investigations were carried out for the above mentioned wormhole with @xmath119 heptagonal defects .",

    "<S> the graphitic wormhole is in the focus of physical interest because of its interesting properties which can remotely resemble the concept of the space wormhole . apart from the usual applications of the carbon nanostructures like the electronic computer devices </S>",
    "<S> , it seems to be a good material for the accumulation of the electric charge and different kinds of molecules , e.g. the hydrogen molecules , which enables using this material for the storage of the new kinds of fuel . here , we present the geometric and electronic structure and calculate the zero modes of this material and its possibly significant derivate , the perturbed wormhole . next , the influence of some additional factors on the electronic structure like the changes of the fermi velocity close to the wormhole bridge as well as the spin - orbit interaction will be investigated . </S>",
    "<S> on this basis , we predict the massive chiral fermions in the connecting wormhole nanotube . </S>"
