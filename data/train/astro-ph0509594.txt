    "grb afterglows are typically observed to decay as power laws in time ( as reviewed by , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the leading afterglow model is the synchrotron fireball @xcite .",
    "it describes the afterglow as synchrotron emission from shock - accelerated electrons with a broken power law spectral energy distribution , with several characteristic break frequencies .",
    "when the typical synchrotron frequency ( @xmath13 ) or the cooling frequency ( @xmath7 ) passes through the optical bands , the model predicts a break in the lightcurve .",
    "the fireball model s spectral breaks have different power law indices depending upon the circumburst medium ( as discussed by * ? ? ?",
    "the different resulting lightcurves allow important physical distinctions to be inferred from early afterglow observations .",
    "one example is the anticipated difference between a constant circumburst density ( called `` ism '' ) or @xmath14 density gradient ( called `` wind '' as it resembles the environment produced by a steady mass - loss wind outflow ) .",
    "the grb follow - up community has worked to produce ever - earlier observations in order to detect lightcurve breaks .",
    "the passage of the cooling frequency , @xmath7 , has been inferred from changes in the broadband spectral index .",
    "the first such example was grb  970508 @xcite , where the optical - to - x - ray slope steepened as if @xmath7 were passing between them .",
    "direct evidence of a cooling break passage in lightcurves is rarer .",
    "grb  030329 showed a shallow change of slope at @xmath15  d postulated to be the cooling break @xcite , although the standard fireball picture is complicated in that case , possibly with `` layered '' ejecta giving 2 jets and 2 jet breaks @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite found a shallow break in the grb  040924 afterglow better explained by @xmath7 than a jet break .",
    "here we report observations of the grb  050502a afterglow in unfiltered optical and @xmath16 bands .",
    "the optical data span nearly 3 logarithmic decades in time and begin at @xmath17  min after the start of the grb .",

    "the bandpass covers the wavelength range of approximately @xmath48 to @xmath49 , but the ly@xmath47 absorption from this @xmath46 significantly depresses wavelengths corresponding to @xmath48 and @xmath50 .",
    "ordinarily the blue spectrum of an ot would cause an overestimation of the @xmath43-band flux from rotse instrumental magnitudes , but in this case extinction across a significant fraction of the bandpass makes the conversion using the zeropoint from unextincted field stars _ underestimate _ the @xmath43-band flux . as a result",
    ", we expect a color term between the rotse @xmath43 and the mdm @xmath1 magnitudes .",
    "the precise color term is a complicated function of the ly@xmath47 absorption and the ot spectrum .",
    "we fit a constant color term parameter when examining @xmath1 and @xmath43 data together , as a constant multiplicative offset of the rotse points relative to the mdm data .",
    "this constancy presumes that any ot color changes within the rotse bandpass have a small effect upon the color term parameter by comparison to the data uncertainties .",
    "the lightcurves are plotted in figure [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the @xmath1-band lightcurve appears to be a broken power law .",
    "the need for a break is made obvious by the precise mdm observations at later times .",
    "the first ( rotse ) point in the lightcurve at @xmath51  s seems underluminous relative to subsequent decay .",
    "the ir data are less well - sampled , but can be described as a set of power laws with decay rates similar to those seen in the @xmath1 band .    to quantify these trends , we fit the data using power law and broken power law forms .",
    "the smooth broken power law form is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the break time , @xmath54 is the flux at the break time , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the two power law indices , and @xmath57 is a sharpness parameter .",
    "the data ( fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] ) clearly require a very sharp break transition .",
    "we use the form above for convenience , but do not fit the sharpness , setting @xmath57 at a very high value ( @xmath58 ) . as noted above , we also fit a constant multiplicative factor for the rotse @xmath43 points , as a color term .",
    "the rotse points after the break observed in the data have significant uncertainties .",
    "we expect any color change that may be associated with the break will not change the color term significantly in comparison to the rotse error bars .",
    "the `` separate '' fit uses the form discussed above for the @xmath1-band data and individual power laws for each ir band ( there is no substantial evidence for breaks in the ir data ) .",
    "this allows each band to have different temporal decays and flux normalizations .",
    "the `` multiband '' fit connects the wavelength bands via a spectral index and coupled temporal decays , as expected in the fireball model .",
    "this fit uses the above functional form for @xmath1-band data , and simultaneously fits single power laws for the ir of the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 designates the frequency of an ir band .",
    "we attempt two `` multiband '' forms , @xmath61 ( the initial @xmath1-band decay index ) and @xmath62 ( the final @xmath1-band decay index ) .",
    "first , we examined the @xmath1-band lightcurve ( rotse & mdm ) .",
    "a single power law does not produce an acceptable fit .",
    "we fit all @xmath1-band data ( including `` @xmath43 '' ) to the `` broken power law + color term '' function described above , and repeated the exercise excluding the first point . both produced formally acceptable fits , but excluding the first point improved the fit notably from @xmath63 for 39 degrees of freedom ( dof ) to @xmath64 for 38 dof .",
    "the first observation , at 44  s post - grb , appears to plateau , not joining the overall decay seen later .",
    "the flux density is approximately 4@xmath65 below the back - extrapolation of the fit excluding the first point , marginal evidence for a deviation at early times from the later decay .",
    "while a single point can not definitively establish such a deviation , the first point does not fit the overall later decay and thus we exclude it from the lightcurve fits discussed below and recorded in table  [ tab : fitpars ] .",
    "the potential constraints placed by this first point are discussed later , in  [ sec : fireball ] .",
    "overluminosity , or flux above the expectations from the subsequent decay , would be expected if a reverse shock s emission were observable as it passes through the ejecta at early times comparable to our first observation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is certainly not seen in our lightcurve .",
    "the maximum flux we observe in the first observation ( 99% confidence upper limit ) is only 90% of the back - extrapolated flux from the fit excluding the first data point .",
    "a flux level significantly above this extrapolation would have been readily measurable .",
    "the @xmath1 ( & @xmath43 ) band , excluding the first point , were fit to the broken power law as described above , and each of the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 bands were independently fit to a power law .",
    "nondetections are included as flux densities of @xmath66 to force the fit not to overestimate undetected fluxes .",
    "however , the elimination of nondetections from the fits does not change the parameters significantly .",
    "the resulting fit parameters are given in table [ tab : fitpars ] .",
    "overall , the total @xmath67 for 61 dof .    due to the ly@xmath47 absorption discussed above , the @xmath1-band fit requires a significant color term , 0.25 magnitudes , for the rotse @xmath43 data relative to the filtered mdm @xmath1 measurements . with this systematic correction ,",
    "the @xmath1-band lightcurve has a sharp break at a time @xmath68  s post - burst .",

    "the expected steepening from a `` jet break '' ( observing a lack of flux due to the edge of conical ejecta ) is at least @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "the only shallow steepening expected in the fireball model is from the passage of the cooling frequency .",
    "the model predicts @xmath73 , consistent with the observed break at the @xmath74 level .",

    "the nir decay indices are not as tightly constrained as those describing the @xmath1-band , with individual uncertainties @xmath75 .",
    "as the @xmath1-band break is shallow , each nir band s decay is consistent with either the initial or the final @xmath1-band decay index ( at the 1.6@xmath65 level or better ) .",
    "consistency with the _ initial _ @xmath1-band decay would be expected for an ism fireball in which @xmath7 drops as @xmath76 , while consistency with the _ final _ @xmath1-band decay would be expected for a wind fireball where @xmath7 rises as @xmath77 ( as reviewed by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the @xmath25 band is slightly more consistent with the ism picture than the wind , the @xmath24 and @xmath23 with the wind than the ism .    as evident from the poorly - determined nir decay rates ,",
    "the nir data do not have the sensitivity to determine the presence or absence of a lightcurve break as shallow as that observed in the @xmath1-band .",
    "moreover , the nir time coverage is from 2320  s to 20700  s and the observed @xmath1-band break is at @xmath68  s. even if the nir data were more sensitive , given the timing of the @xmath1-band lightcurve break , in the ism ( wind ) model prediction , @xmath7 would not be observed falling ( rising ) to ( from ) the @xmath23 band during the nir coverage .",
    "the ism model would predict that @xmath7 would fall from @xmath1 to @xmath23 only at @xmath78  s. the wind model would predict that @xmath7 would rise from @xmath23 to @xmath1 , with the break in @xmath23 at @xmath79  s.      given no obvious color changes , we also fit the multiband function as described in   [ earlyunderlum ] , [ separatefit ] .",
    "we gave initial parameters to search for two cases , with the nir decay either the power law behavior of the initial @xmath1-band lightcurve decay , or of the final @xmath1 decay .",
    "the two results are shown in table [ tab : fitpars ] .",

    "both multiband fits are formally quite good , with @xmath81/dof@xmath821 .",
    "the data are insufficiently constraining to distinguish between @xmath83 ( ism expectation ) , and @xmath84 ( wind expectation ) .",
    "we show both of these fits in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] , where the shallower @xmath11 favored by the @xmath84 model and the steeper ir decay make the fitted model underestimate all the @xmath25 data slightly . as the fit is nevertheless good , this only mildly favors @xmath85 and the ism interpretation .",
    "the optical - nir spectrum of the data is well fit by a power law @xmath86 .",
    "this is observed in the nir data alone ( @xmath44 at one common epoch ) , as well as @xmath87 data ( interpolating the @xmath1-band point ) .",
    "there is no significant change across observation epochs as there is no evidence for color changes from the lightcurves .",
    "the temporal decays of the ir bands are not strongly constrained ( @xmath88 , table  [ tab : fitpars ] ) , are all mutually consistent , and are consistent ( at @xmath89 ) with either the initial or the final @xmath1-band decay .",
    "moreover , the complete dataset is well fit by the `` multiband '' function that includes the spectral index @xmath11 to connect the bands .    the @xmath44 spectrum at the initial epoch yields @xmath90 , while @xmath87 gives @xmath91 .",
    "these are not as well - constrained as the @xmath11 fit using the `` multiband '' function .",
    "when @xmath83 , @xmath92 is fit , and when @xmath84 , @xmath93 .",
    "these results are all mutually consistent . given their variation , we take our measure of the optical - nir spectral index to be @xmath94 . the observed @xmath1-band lightcurve break will produce color changes relative to the single power laws of the nir bands , but they are not detectable as we do not have good ir detections in the period from the break to the end of our nir observations .",

    "this x - ray  optical spectrum is consistent with the passage of @xmath7 . with an ism model",

    ", @xmath7 increases with time , placing it between @xmath1 and the x - ray at the time of the x - ray limit .",
    "however , @xmath7 would not get far above the optical and the spectrum steepens between @xmath7 and the x - ray . in both cases , the steepening @xmath131 above @xmath7 results in a model - predicted x - ray flux well below the _",

    "if the sub - luminosity of the earliest @xmath1-band observation ( 44  s ) were known to be due to the passage of the peak @xmath13 , there would be three numerical constraints for the fireball model s spectral parameters : the peak time in @xmath1-band , the peak flux density value at that time , and the cooling break time at the @xmath1-band frequency .",
    "the early lightcurve behavior is neither strong evidence for a rollover from an earlier flatter lightcurve evolution , nor for a particular physical mechanism for a rollover .",
    "therefore the first two constraints are inequalities ; the peak @xmath13 could have have passed the optical band earlier .    the observed decay from @xmath132 to @xmath133  s requires that the passage @xmath134 is occurring or has occurred at @xmath135  s. if @xmath13 passed the @xmath1-band before @xmath132  s , the synchrotron spectral peak would be at a lower frequency and a higher flux density than the @xmath1-band s .",

    "the peak passage @xmath13 is quite early , having occurred at a time no later than 2.1 times the grb duration measured by @xcite .",
    "the cooling break passage time of @xmath137  s is significant , placing @xmath7 in the optical at a fairly early time .",
    "this is quite early in comparison to several other cases where broadband data has indicated @xmath7 is above the optical at a time @xmath6 days post - burst , e.g. , 970508 @xcite , 000301c @xcite , or 011211 @xcite .",
    "the implication in the ism case with @xmath138 would be a low value of @xmath7 during the first observation , with @xmath139hz at @xmath132  s.    we consider the observational constraints in light of both the ism and the wind models for the data .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum of a spherical fireball expanding into the ism at a known redshift depends upon five parameters : energy @xmath140 , density @xmath141 , the power law slope of the electron energy distribution @xmath107 , the energy fraction partitioned to the electrons , @xmath142 , and the energy partition to the magnetic fields , @xmath143 ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . with three constraints and the value of @xmath107",
    ", we can put three of @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath143 , and @xmath142 in terms of the fourth , thus placing a limit upon a combination of two parameters .",
    "we use the equations of @xcite for the ism slow - cooling case for @xmath13 , @xmath7 , and @xmath144 . adopting @xmath145",
    ", we find the numerical relations using the redshift @xmath45 @xcite and a cosmology with @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148  km  s@xmath149mpc@xmath149 to determine the appropriate luminosity distance .",
    "we can then isolate @xmath150 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 are scaled to 10% and 1% respectively as these are reasonable expectations for the parameters from broadband fits in many afterglow cases ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "within the simple fireball model that well - describes this afterglow case in the optical - ir , the implication is that the microphysical energy partitions must be quite small .",
    "for example , if @xmath151 , then @xmath152 .",

    "3 is proportional to the peak flux density at 44  s as @xmath156 , and to the frequency of the peak @xmath13 at 44  s as @xmath157 .",
    "thus if the peak was significantly below the @xmath1 band at that time , this combination of microphysical parameters would be notably smaller .    for a wind model",

    "there is an additional constraint : @xmath162 this inequality indicates that , if @xmath163 at the initial observation , @xmath164 would be larger than 0.0004 .",
    "however , from the previous relation the low @xmath13 would require smaller microphysical parameters , @xmath142 or @xmath143 or both .",
    "if @xmath142 is decreased in the case @xmath163 , then @xmath158 would remain low .",
    "a value @xmath165 is a very small wind outflow parameter ; @xmath166 is observed in wolf - rayet stars ( as reviewed by * ? ? ?",
    "the physical parameter constraints are somewhat easier to fulfill with the ism fireball model than with the wind model .",
    "we observe a shallow break of @xmath100 in the @xmath1 lightcurve of the grb  050502a afterglow at approximately 6000  s post - burst .",
    "we note that @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 observations during this period , not as well - sampled , do not constrain the presence or absence of such a lightcurve break in the nir . with the shallow @xmath80",
    ", we conclude that the optical break represents the passage of the synchrotron cooling frequency @xmath7 through @xmath1 .",
    "the observed spectral index is @xmath9 .",
    "this is consistent with an ism model for the broken @xmath1-band lightcurve , and slightly steeper than expected in a wind model .",
    "the temporal and spectral index closure relations slightly favor an ism over a wind interpretation . a small amount of dust at the host redshift",
    "would steepen an intrinsically flatter spectrum sufficiently to accomodate the wind interpretation .",
    "there is no evidence for an overluminosity at our earliest observation , 44  s after the initial gamma - rays .",
    "the first lightcurve point appears suppressed , but from a single point we can not conclude that this is the case . at a minimum , the early decay requires @xmath13 at or below @xmath167 at that time . using that constraint and the observation of @xmath7 s",
    "passage indicates that in both the ism and the wind explanations small microphysical energy partitions are required .",

    ", @xcite did not detect the passage of @xmath7 through @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite find the data favors a density variation over a refreshed shock as the source of the bump .",
    "in that case , the significance of the bump is greater than expected for @xmath169 ( see * ? ? ? * ) . for the wind case",
    "the cooling break passage observed in the dataset presented here would be from @xmath169 to @xmath170 at @xmath826000  s , so this again favors an ism over a wind interpretation .",
    "we note that the observed steeper , steady decay following the lightcurve break is evident in the data over at least 0.7 logarithmic decades in time . despite the evidence for a density variation in the data of @xcite",
    ", such an impulsive event can not explain the sustained change in lightcurve evolution seen here .",
    "there are several lines of evidence , including the spectral index , the closure relations of spectral and temporal indices , and the optical bump seen by @xcite , that all somewhat favor an ism model over a wind one for this afterglow .    with _ swift _ and integral providing rapid triggers , and rapid response instruments such as rotse and pairitel providing followup , the grb community is accumulating bursts with prompt , detailed observations .",
