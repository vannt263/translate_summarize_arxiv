    "within the last decade the investigation of the thermodynamics and phase structure of strongly interacting matter has been driven by the results of the experimental programs with ultrarelativistic heavy ion beams at cern - sps and bnl - rhic @xcite as well as by the unprecedented quality of data from lattice qcd simulations @xcite .",
    "a new picture of the state of matter created in these experiments has emerged , according to which the physical nature of the sought - for quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is a perfect liquid of strongly correlated hadron - like resonances rather than an ideal gas of quasifree quarks and gluons @xcite .",
    "the persistence of a strong , nonperturbative coupling in the qgp can be supposed as a prerequisite of a successful modelling of the qcd phase diagram . turning to the domain of finite chemical potentials , guidance from lattice qcd",
    "is limited to @xmath4 ( where taylor expansion techniques can be applied ) , and experimental programmes such as cbm at fair darmstadt are yet in the stage of preparation with a planned begin of operation in 2014 .",
    "therefore , predictions for the qcd thermodynamics at low temperatures and high baryon densities @xmath5 , where the critical point and the regions of color superconducting quark matter are expected in the qcd phase diagram  @xcite , have to be developed within effective models for nonperturbative qcd and to be tested against observational constraints from neutron stars @xcite .",
    "for a recently developed testing scheme we refer to @xcite .",
    "after the early discussion on color superconducting dense quark matter  @xcite was revived for nonperturbatively strong couplings within effective quark models  @xcite , a great variety of possible diquark pairing patterns and corresponding phases has been explored  @xcite and estimates for the order of magnitude of the pairing gaps have been given .",
    "one of the central questions for phenomenological applications in compact stars , where electric and charge neutrality has to be imposed  @xcite , concerns the number of active flavors .",
    "it turns out that at low temperatures one obtains a sequential melting pattern of the light and strange quark chiral condensates , which is rather insensitive to the details of the four - momentum dependence of the interaction , but crucially dependent on whether also the strange quark mass is determined selfconsistently ( see  @xcite for an early work within the covariant chiral quark model ) .",
    "the present state - of - the - art for the description of color superconducting phases is represented by the fully selfconsistent mean field three - flavor nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model calculations of refs .",
    "the results of these studies indicate that under compact star conditions , i.e.  color and electric charge neutrality together with @xmath6 equilibrium , the two - flavor color superconducting ( 2sc ) phase is favored over the three - flavor color - flavor - locking ( cfl ) one .",
    "this outdates earlier results along the lines of , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite where the strange quark mass has been set to a constant , small value .",
    "even if the third quark flavor occurs at not too high densities to be in principle realized in compact star interiors , the star configurations with cfl quark cores turn out to be hydrodynamically unstable @xcite . for a more detailed introduction to the recent status of dense quark matter in the njl model , see  @xcite .",
    "studies of neutral 2sc quark matter consider also the presence of a so - called gapless ( g2sc ) phase  @xcite , which is found to occur at intermediate temperatures and chemical potentials .",
    "going beyond the njl theory , results arising from a noncovariant nonlocal quark model  @xcite with gaussian regulator functions show that the 2sc phase is not present in asymmetric quark matter for standard values of the diquark coupling  @xcite . in this model , however , for strong diquark couplings one does find a 2sc phase , together with a g2sc and a mixed normal quark matter ( nqm)-2sc phase in which the electric charge neutrality is satisfied only globally  @xcite",
    ".    as the structure of the quark matter phase diagram within njl - type models is settling , it is important to investigate the situation in the case of effective models that go beyond those used in refs .",
    "@xcite , in the sense that they include fully covariant nonlocal interactions .",
    "nonlocality arises naturally in the context of several quite successful approaches to low energy quark dynamics as , for example , the instanton liquid model  @xcite and the schwinger - dyson resummation techniques  @xcite .",
    "the same happens in lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "it has been also argued that nonlocal models have several advantages over the local ones ( e.g. , the njl model  @xcite and its generalizations ) .",
    "indeed , nonlocal interactions regularize the model in such a way that anomalies are preserved  @xcite and charges properly quantized , the effective interaction is finite to all orders in the loop expansion and there is no need to introduce extra cut - offs .",
    "soft regulators such as gaussian functions lead to small next - to - leading order corrections  @xcite , etc . this type of models has been successfully used to investigate meson  @xcite and baryon  @xcite properties at vanishing temperature and chemical potential .",
    "the phase diagram of isospin symmetric matter has also been studied within this context  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to extend these analyses to the case in which compact star conditions are imposed .",
    "we will consider two - flavor versions of the models , since ( as mentioned below ) effects arising from the strange quark can be safely neglected in the region of intermediate chemical potentials to be covered .",
    "the investigation of the question whether the results of the above referenced studies will remain qualitatively unchanged after the inclusion of correlations beyond the mean - field level goes beyond the scope of the present work and deserves a separate study .",
    "it should be noticed , however , that in the non - strange case considered here the relevant color superconducting condensate transforms as a singlet representation of the global su(2)@xmath7su(2)@xmath8 chiral group .",
    "thus , no global symmetry is broken by the 2sc ground state , which implies that there are no goldstone bosons that could further condense .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the model and derive some useful analytical expressions . in section",
    "iii we present the numerical results obtained for the case of a gaussian regulator , considering different ratios between the coupling constants .",
    "then , in section iv we discuss the features of the obtained phase diagrams , and in section v we present our conclusions .",

    "we will work within two alternative scenarios , that we call `` model i '' and `` model ii '' , in which the mesonic current @xmath13 and the diquark current @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) are given by nonlocal operators .",

    "( [ action ] ) is quite common to effective theories for low - energy qcd such as the njl model .",
    "the momentum dependence introduced by the functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 is a generalization of that model , and can be chosen in such a way that the dynamical mass function of the quark propagator reproduces some features obtained in lattice qcd analyses .",
    "it could entail , e.g. , the possibility of complex conjugate mass poles of the quark propagator , in agreement with results arising from the schwinger - dyson equation approach to qcd .",

    "in fact , so far there is no strong phenomenological constraint on @xmath29 , except for the fact that values larger that @xmath31 are quite unlikely to be realized in qcd , since they might lead to color symmetry breaking in the vacuum .",
    "we will leave this ratio as a free parameter , analyzing the results obtained for values lying within a range from 0.5 to 1 .",

    "[ varios ] , where we plot these quantities as functions of @xmath1 for different representative values of the temperature . left and right panels correspond to models i and ii , respectively .    for @xmath117 ( solid lines ) , at low chemical potentials the system is for both models i and ii in a chiral symmetry broken phase ( csb ) , where quarks acquire large dynamical masses . by increasing the chemical potential",
    "one reaches a first order phase transition , in which the chiral symmetry is approximately restored , and a certain volume fraction of the quark matter undergoes a transition to the 2sc phase coexisting with the remaining normal quark matter ( nqm ) phase .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath83 ( which for @xmath117 vanishes in the csb region ) also shows a discontinuity across the transition .",
    "the new 2sc - nqm mixed phase is a way in which the system realizes the constraint of electric neutrality globally : the coexisting phases have opposite electric charges which neutralize each other , at a common equilibrium pressure . in its simplest realization ,",
    "this mixed phase is treated within an approximation in which coulomb and surface energies are neglected ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for color superconducting quark matter",
    "this realization of charge neutrality has been considered e.g.  in ref .",
    "@xcite for the njl model and in ref .",
    "@xcite for the instantaneous nonlocal quark model .",
    "the discussion of inhomogeneous mixed phases , which are not yet fully understood , crucially depends on the assumptions for the surface tension and charge screening effects ( see e.g.ref .",
    "@xcite ) and goes beyond the scope of the present investigation . on the other hand , following refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , we have imposed color neutrality as a local constraint .",
    "this is based on the fact that the color debye screening length is expected to be short and comparable to the inter - particle distance in the regime of interest . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath78 turns out to be different in the two components of the mixed phase .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that this chemical potential is in fact an effective quantity that has to be introduced in these kind of models in order to account for the effect of the gauge fields .",
    "namely , as argued in refs .",
    "@xcite , superconducting quark matter is expected to be automatically color neutral in qcd . as expected , the growth of the color chemical potential @xmath78 in the 2sc component of the mixed phase is approximately proportional to that of the corresponding @xmath123 , which governs the amount of breakdown of the color symmetry due to quark pairing .    when the temperature is increased ( see dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ varios ] , corresponding to @xmath124 mev ) , the mixed phase is no longer favored and the system goes into a pure 2sc phase . for @xmath124 mev , this shows up as a second order transition in the case of model i , and a first order transition in the case of model ii .",
    "now , for both models , when one moves along the first order transition line from @xmath117 towards higher temperatures , one arrives at a triple point ( 3p ) . at this point",
    "the csb and 2sc phases coexist with a third nqm phase , in which the chiral symmetry is approximately restored and there is no color superconductivity .",
    "finally , if @xmath0 is still increased , one reaches an `` end point '' ( ep ) where the first order transition from csb to nqm phases becomes a smooth crossover .",
    "the behavior of the dynamical masses and the electric chemical potential @xmath83 along this smooth transition is shown in fig .",
    "[ varios ] , see curves corresponding to @xmath124 mev ( model i ) and @xmath125 mev ( dotted lines , models i and ii ) .      the described features of the phase diagrams for models i and ii can be visualized in the graphs shown in fig .  [ fases ] , where we plot the transition curves on @xmath126 diagrams for different ratios @xmath29 , and show the regions corresponding to the different phases and the position of triple and end points . in the graphs ,",
    "solid and dotted lines correspond to the mentioned first order and crossover transitions , respectively ( in the case of the crossover , the transition point can be defined by considering the maximum of the chiral susceptibility  @xcite ) . between nqm and 2sc regions we find that in all cases there is a second order phase transition , which corresponds to the dashed lines in the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fases ] .",
    "close to this phase border , the dashed - dotted lines in the graphs delimit a band that corresponds to the so - called gapless 2sc ( g2sc ) phase . here , in addition to the two gapless modes corresponding to the unpaired blue quarks , the presence of flavor asymmetric chemical potentials @xmath127 gives rise to another two gapless fermionic quasiparticles  @xcite .",
    "although the corresponding relations can not be derived analytically owing to the nonlocality of the interactions , the border of the g2sc region can be numerically found .",
    "this is done by determining whether for some value of @xmath128 the imaginary part of some of the poles of the euclidean quark propagator vanish in the complex @xmath35 plane . from the graphs",
    "it is seen that this g2sc band may become relatively significant for low values of @xmath29 .",
    "however , it never extends up to zero temperatures , therefore this should not represent a robust feature for compact star applications .    .",
    "full and dashed lines indicate first and second order phase transition curves respectively , dotted lines correspond to crossover - like transitions , and dashed lines delimit the gapless 2sc band .",
    "different phases are denoted as nqm ( normal quark matter phase ) , csb ( chiral symmetry broken phase ) and 2sc ( two - flavor superconducting phase ) , while the regions marked as  mixed \" correspond to the nqm-2sc mixed phase .",
    "note that in model i , for @xmath129 there is a narrow region in which one has 2sc while the system is still in a chiral symmetry broken phase .",
    "ep and 3p denote the end points and triple points respectively . ]",
    "let us discuss some qualitative features of the curves displayed in figs .",
    "[ varios ] and  [ fases ] . on one hand , for both models",
    "the 2sc phase region becomes larger when the ratio @xmath29 is increased .",
    "this is not surprising , since @xmath114 is the effective coupling governing the quark - quark interaction that gives rise to the pairing . in any case , as a general conclusion it can be stated that , provided the ratio @xmath29 is not too low , these nonlocal schemes favor the existence of color superconducting phases at low temperatures and moderate chemical potentials .",
    "indeed , for the parameters considered here , there is no 2sc phase only in the case of model ii , @xmath130 .",
    "this is in contrast with the situation in e.g.  the njl model @xcite , where the existence of such a phase turns out to be rather dependent on the input parameters .",
    "in addition , our results are qualitatively different from those obtained in the case of the noncovariant nonlocal models  @xcite , where above the chiral phase transition the nqm phase is preferable for values of the coupling ratio @xmath131 . in those models , a color superconducting quark",
    "matter phase can be found only for @xmath132 .",
    "it is also interesting to compare our results with those obtained for isospin symmetric quark matter .",
    "for the same parameter sets , the corresponding phase diagrams for @xmath30 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fases_2sc ] . by comparing them with those of fig .",
    "[ fases ] , it can be seen that the 2sc region becomes reduced when one imposes color and electric charge neutrality conditions .",
    "this is indeed what one would expect , since the condition of electric charge neutrality leads in general to unequal @xmath11 and @xmath12 quark densities , disfavoring the @xmath11-@xmath12 pairing .",
    "we notice , however , that the effect is relatively small , and the positions of triple and end points as well as the shape of the critical lines remain approximately unchanged . concerning the shape of the chiral phase transition line @xmath133 , one observes at intermediate temperatures , which are relevant for the future cbm experiment , an approximately linear behavior .",
    "this can be seen as an interpolation between a convex shape obtained in njl or bag models and a concave shape for confining dyson - schwinger equation models , see e.g.  ref .",
    "it is remarkable that thus in the nonlocal covariant models presented here a similarity with confining quark models occurs and that the chiral / deconfinement transition line in the phase diagram resembles very closely the positions of freeze - out parameters in heavy ion collisions .     ]    finally , we have studied the dependence of the phase transitions on the model parameters , changing the input value of the chiral condensate within a phenomenologically reasonable range 220 mev @xmath134 280 mev . from this analysis",
    ", it is seen that the qualitative features of the phase diagrams are not significantly modified . in particular",
    ", it is seen that one finds in general color superconducting phases at low temperatures and moderate chemical potentials , for intermediate values of the ratio @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , the values for the critical temperature at @xmath2 are quite stable , yielding about 120 mev for model i and 140 mev for model ii .",
    "this would favor the description given by model ii , in which the result is closer to the values provided by lattice calculations .",
    "we have considered the phase diagram of two - flavor quark matter under neutron star constraints for two nonlocal , covariant quark models within the mean field approximation . in the first one the nonlocality was due to the regularization procedure , motivated by the instanton liquid model ( model i ) , whereas in the second model a separable approximation of the one - gluon exchange interaction was applied ( model ii ) .",
    "although for the gaussian regulators considered in this work the vacuum gap equations are identical , both models differ in their fluctuation spectrum and therefore in their parameters ( current quark mass @xmath10 , coupling strength @xmath103 , uv cutoff @xmath102 ) , which have been fixed by using input values for the pion mass , the pion decay constant and the chiral condensate . as result of the numerical evaluation of the corresponding gap equations at finite temperature and chemical potential ,",
    "we have obtained that model ii predicts a larger quark mass gap and a chiral symmetry breaking phase transition line which extends 15 - 20% further into the @xmath135 plane when compared to model i. the prediction for the critical temperature at @xmath2 in model ii , @xmath136140 mev , is closer to the results of recent lattice qcd simulations than the prediction of both model i and the well - known local njl model .",
    "considering different values for the coupling strength in the scalar diquark channel , we have found that under neutron star constraints different low - temperature quark matter phases can occur at intermediate densities : normal quark matter ( nqm ) , pure superconducting ( 2sc ) quark matter and mixed 2sc - nqm phases .",
    "the critical temperature for the 2sc phase transition is a rising function of @xmath1 in the case of model i whereas it is rather independent of @xmath1 for model ii , due to the different @xmath1 dependences associated with the scalar diquark gaps .",
    "a band of gapless 2sc ( g2sc ) appears at the border between 2sc and normal quark matter . at large values of the @xmath29 ratio it is given by a tiny strip in the phase diagram , and grows broader at low diquark couplings .",
    "however , the g2sc region does not reach zero temperatures , thus it should not represent a robust feature for compact star applications .",
    "our present investigation has been limited to the mean field approximation and the neglect of the strange quark flavor .",
    "none of these approximations is expected to be crucial for compact star applications , and the detailed study of their impact on our results has been left for further development of the present approach .",

    "<S> we consider the phase diagram of two - flavor quark matter under neutron star constraints for two nonlocal , covariant quark models within the mean field approximation . in the first case ( model i ) </S>",
    "<S> the nonlocality arises from the regularization procedure , motivated by the instanton liquid model , whereas in the second one ( model ii ) a separable approximation of the one - gluon exchange interaction is applied . </S>",
    "<S> we find that model ii predicts a larger quark mass gap and a chiral symmetry breaking ( csb ) phase transition line which extends 15 - 20 % further into the phase diagram spanned by temperature ( @xmath0 ) and chemical potential ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding critical temperature at @xmath2 , @xmath3 mev , is in better accordance to recent lattice qcd results than the prediction of the standard local njl model , which exceeds 200 mev . for both model i and model </S>",
    "<S> ii we have considered various coupling strengths in the scalar diquark channel , showing that different low - temperature quark matter phases can occur at intermediate densities : a normal quark matter ( nqm ) phase , a two - flavor superconducting ( 2sc ) quark matter phase and a mixed 2sc - nqm phase . </S>",
    "<S> although in most cases there is also a gapless 2sc phase , this occurs in general in a small region at nonzero temperatures , thus its effect should be negligible for compact star applications . </S>"
