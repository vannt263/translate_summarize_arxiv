    "narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) are defined by their optical line properties ( e.g. goodrich  1989 ) : ( _ i. _ ) the balmer lines are only slightly broader than the forbidden lines ( h@xmath1  fwhm@xmath2 ) ; ( _ ii .",
    "_ ) the forbidden line emission is relatively weak ( [ o  iii]/h@xmath3 ) ; ( _ iii . _ ) there are often strong emission features from fe  ii and high ionization optical lines .",
    "it has recently been discovered that they also have distinctive x - ray properties .",
    "_ rosat _ pspc observations found that the soft x - ray spectra are systematically steeper than `` classical '' seyfert 1s and that the photon index appears correlated with the optical line width .",
    "nls1s also very frequently exhibit rapid and/or high amplitude x - ray variability ( boller , brandt & fink  1996 ; forster & halpern  1996 and references therein ) .",
    "nls1 observations with _ asca _ , which has better energy resolution and a larger band pass ,",
    "find that the steep spectrum in the soft x - ray band is primarily due to a strong soft excess component with characteristic blackbody temperature in the range 0.10.2  kev and a relatively weak hard power law .",
    "the hard x - ray power law slope is either remarkably variable ( leighly et al .",
    "1996 ; guainazzi et  al .",
    "1996 ) , or significantly steeper than found in broad - line seyfert 1s ( pounds , done & osborne  1995 ; brandt , mathur & elvis  1997 ) .",
    "the combination of strong soft excess and steep power law prompted pounds , done & osborne  ( 1995 ) to postulate that nls1s represent the supermassive black hole analog of galactic black hole candidates in the high state .",
    "we considered all the _ asca _ data from nls1s in the archive as of february 1997 , and three proprietary data sets , yielding a sample of 16 objects .",
    "a standard uniform analysis was applied to all data ( e.g. nandra et al .",
    "1997 ; details in leighly et al .",
    "1997 ) .    in most cases ,",
    "a power law model fit the spectra poorly , and an additional soft excess model was required .",
    "the soft component in these nls1s is hot and prominent , and a single black body is not broad enough to fit the whole energy range from 0.48  kev . a disk blackbody model , which is the sum of blackbodies ( makishima et al .",
    "1986 ) , is broader .",
    "therefore , we fit a disk blackbody model in the energy band @xmath4  kev",
    ". however , our discussion of absorption features below does not depend critically on the assumed model of the soft continuum .",
    "fits over a truncated energy band @xmath5  kev with a single blackbody give consistent parameters for the absorption features , with comparable @xmath6 .    in many cases ,",
    "the power - law plus disk blackbody model gave an adequate fit .",
    "however , a significant dip remained near 1 kev in the fit residuals from 1h  0707 - 495 , iras  13224 - 3809 , and pg  1404 + 226 ( hereafter h0707 , ir1322 , and pg1404 ; fig .  1 ;",
    "also see hayashida 1996 ; otani , kii & miya 1996 ; comastri , molendi & ulrich 1997 ) .",
    "similar features have been reported in _ rosat _",
    "spectra from akn  564 ( brandt et al .",
    "1994 ) and pg1404 ( ulrich - demoulin & molendi  1996 ) .",
    "addition of an edge to the model improved the fit by @xmath7/degrees of freedom ( d.o.f.)@xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , significant at @xmath11 confidence level , for h0707 , ir1322 and pg1404 , respectively .",
    "for h0707 and ir1322 , an additional edge reduced the @xmath12 by @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the best fit parameters for these two - edge fits , and the single edge fit for pg1404 , are listed in table  1 .",
    "to4.5 in    ' '' ''    absorption edges , a signature of highly ionized gas in the line - of - sight , are commonly found in the x - ray spectra from bright seyfert 1 galaxies ( e.g. reynolds  1997 ) .",
    "oxygen edges from o  vii and o  viii at 0.74 and 0.87  kev respectively are expected to dominate the absorption profile because of the large abundance and cross sections .",
    "however , the edges in our objects are found at much higher energies than could be attributed to oxygen in the agn rest frame . in this energy range ,",
    "absorption by neon and iron is expected , but for abundances near solar , it is difficult to produce deep absorption edges from these elements without also finding strong oxygen edges . since neon differs in atomic number by only two from oxygen , its ionization state should not be drastically different .",
    "since both oxygen and neon are plausibly produced predominately by type ii supernovae , their relative abundance should not vary much .",
    "iron species which could absorb from the l  shell are still present when oxygen is nearly fully ionized , but the expected dominant ions have higher energy absorption edges than we find here , near 1.21.4 kev .",
    "we can attribute the absorption edges to ionized oxygen if the absorbing material is being accelerated away from the nucleus , similar to broad absorption line galaxies ( balqso ; see weymann  1995 and turnshek  1995 for recent reviews ) .",
    "if we identify the observed edges in h0707 and ir1322 with o  vii and o  viii , we infer an ejection velocity of @xmath15 to @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the consistency in velocity for both ions .",
    "for pg1404 , we detect only one edge , and infer velocity of either @xmath17 or @xmath18 depending on whether it is due to o  vii or o  viii .",
    "to4.5 in    ' '' ''    alternatively , the absorption features may be due to resonance line absorption .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "sis detectors have moderate resolution ( @xmath19  ev at 1  kev ) , and since the lines have low equivalent width @xmath20 , they can be detected only if the velocity dispersion is @xmath21  km s@xmath22 .",
    "we added `` narrow '' ( @xmath23 ) gaussian lines to the power law plus disk blackbody model , effectively modeling features narrower than the detector response width .",
    "addition of an absorption line to the disk blackbody plus power law model reduced the @xmath12 by @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26  d.o.f . , and the second line by @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29  d.o.f . for h0707 , ir1322 and pg1404 respectively .",
    "addition of a third line for h0707 and ir1322 reduced the @xmath12 by @xmath30 and @xmath31  d.o.f .",
    "details of these multiple - line fits are shown in table 1 .",
    "the final @xmath12 are comparable to the edge fit results so we can not distinguish these models statistically .",
    "note that the two lines present in all spectra are consistent in energy from object to object , although the differences in cosmological redshift ( @xmath32 , 0.067 & 0.098 for h0707 , ir1322 and pg1404 , respectively ) imply a difference of 50  ev in observed energy . assuming the absorber is completely opaque and fitting with the xspec _ notch _ model ( equivalent to a very saturated absorption line ) gives a velocity profile fwhm of @xmath33 , similar to that found in balqsos .",
    "resonance absorption is expected to be strong in hydrogen - like and helium - like atoms , and the ratios of the energies should be the same for every element . again , we can plausibly identify the two common lines in all spectra as o  vii and o  viii at @xmath34 and 0.651  kev , respectively . a lower energy line in the h0707 spectrum",
    "n  vii at 0.498  kev , while a higher energy line in the ir1322 spectrum has no clear identification .",
    "these line identifications imply consistent ejection velocities , near @xmath35 ( fig .",
    "absorption edges should accompany the resonance absorption lines ( madejski et al .",
    "adding o  vii and o  viii absorption edges to the model with energies fixed at the values predicted if @xmath36 , we find that the optical depths @xmath37 are consistent with zero , and the @xmath38 upper limits were 0.27 , 0.68 and 0.50 for o  vii and 0.32 , 0.13 and 0.26 for o  viii , for h0707 , ir1322 and pg1404 respectively . in section  3 we show that estimations of the column densities derived from these upper limits are consistent with those from the absorption line equivalent widths .",
    "as noted above , the measured edge energies seem inconsistent with those expected from iron - l species . however , iron is a complex ion potentially producing a complex absorption profile which might fit these moderate resolution spectra .",
    "we used a power law plus disk blackbody model , transmitted through an ionized absorber in the agn rest frame with iron abundance free ( magdziarz & zdziarski  1995 ) . in this model , the electron temperature @xmath39 and",
    "the ionization parameter @xmath40 are both free parameters , and we chose two representative values @xmath41  k and @xmath42  k. these models produced a worse fit overall compared with the models described above and required rather large iron overabundances . for @xmath43 , we obtained iron abundance lower limits of 15 , 29 and 17 times solar with @xmath7/d.o.f.=11/264 , 13/301 , & 6/150 , and for @xmath44 , we obtained iron abundance best fits values of 3.9 , 7.3 and 12.8 with @xmath7/d.o.f.=0/264 , 12/301 , & 7/150 for h0707 , ir1322 and pg1404 respectively .",
    "iron enhancements up to 10 with respect to oxygen might be expected in some cases , but probably not as large as 20 ( hamann & ferland  1993 )",
    ". a high iron abundance could not be responsible for the strong fe  ii emission in nls1 , because the resulting cooler temperature decreases the number of fe@xmath45 ions while the optical depth to escaping fe  ii increases ( e.g. joly  1993 ) .    in summary",
    ", we tried to explain the 1  kev features using three different models .",
    "either absorption edges or lines produced a good fit which could not be distinguished statistically .",
    "the iron overabundance model generally gave a poorer fit .",
    "the outflow velocities of @xmath46 inferred in these objects are very large , larger than those observed the uv spectra of balqsos .",
    "such large velocities could be difficult to identify in the uv , because the prominent c  iv line would be shifted out of the band pass or into the ly@xmath47 forest where it might be hard to distinguish .",
    "also , very large velocity dispersions with moderate column densities might result in lines so broad that they blend in with the continuum .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to speculate on the mechanism required to accelerate material to these very large velocities , but it is interesting to note that the velocity implied by the edge fits is close to that seen in the galactic jet object ss  433 of @xmath48 and also to the terminal velocity predicted by `` line - locking '' of @xmath49 ( shapiro , milgrom & rees  1986 ) .",
    "the larger velocities implied by the absorption line fits is intriguingly close to the energy of a particle in circular orbits around a kerr black hole ( e.g. shapiro & teukolsky  1993 ) .",
    "however , it seems difficult to relate this fact to a physical outflow mechanism .",
    "we obtain lower limits on the equivalent hydrogen column . for the absorption edge model , assuming cross sections of 2.8 and @xmath50 for o  vii and o  viii , respectively , and an oxygen abundance relative to hydrogen of @xmath51 , the o  vii+o  viii equivalent hydrogen column densities are in the range @xmath52 . for the absorption lines , assumed to be on the linear part of the curve of growth , oscillator strengths of 0.694 and 0.416 for o  vii and o  viii",
    "were used , giving o  vii+o  viii equivalent hydrogen column densities of @xmath53 . in each case , the column density upper limits on the absorption edges predicted to accompany these absorption lines were larger , showing that this model is viable .",
    "while estimation of the ionization parameter depends on the input continuum and is beyond the scope of this paper , we note that the o  viii column is always larger than the o  vii column , implying a fairly high ionization parameter .",
    "rest frame absorption features in the x - ray spectra of broad - line hard x - ray selected agn are common ( reynolds  1997 ) , plausibly arising in the same material as @xmath54 absorption lines found in the uv ( e.g. mathur , elvis & wilkes  1995 ) .",
    "these ` associated ' absorption features may be related to the broad uv absorption lines seen in higher luminosity objects ( e.g. kolman et al .",
    "evidence suggests that some aspect of the nls1 central engine is significantly different compared with broad - line objects ; for example , they may be characterized by a higher accretion rate relative to eddington ( pounds , done & osborne  1995 ) .",
    "the rapid , higher amplitude and perhaps characteristically nonlinear x - ray variability may be evidence for strong relativistic effects ( boller et al .  1997 ; leighly et al .",
    "these results may indicate a higher level of activity relative to the black hole mass in nls1s , and strong relativistic outflows might be expected .",
    "the blue - shifted absorption features discussed here are reminiscent of those found in the uv spectra of broad absorption line quasars",
    ". a connection between nls1s and balqsos may be quite reasonable considering that they have many optical emission line and broad band continuum properties in common .",
    "many nls1s and balqsos show strong or extreme fe  ii emission and weak [ o  iii ] emission .",
    "objects which have the strongest fe  ii emission and weakest or no [ o  iii ] emission tend to be either low ionization balqsos or nls1s ( boroson & meyers  1992 ; turnshek et al .  1997 ; lawrence et al .",
    "many nls1s and low ionization balqsos have red optical continuum spectra , and relatively strong infrared emission ( boroson & meyers  1992 ; moran , halpern & helfand  1996 ; turnshek  1997 )",
    ". finally , both classes are predominantly radio quiet ( stocke et al .  1992 ; ulvestad , antonucci , & goodrich  1995 ) .",
    "an interesting possibility is that the low - ionization balqsos and nls1s have a common parent population ( e.g. lawrence et al .",
    "if so , perhaps objects with intermediate properties between nls1s and low - ionization balqsos should exist .",
    "it was recently reported that nls1 iras  13349 + 2438 has uv broad absorption lines ( turnshek  1997 ) .",
    "but while most balqsos are x - ray quiet , this object is a bright soft x - ray source and has the very steep hard x - ray spectrum and rapid x - ray variability characteristic of nls1s ( brinkmann et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
