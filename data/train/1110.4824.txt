    "it is easy to verify that if @xmath241 are integers such that either ( i ) @xmath242 ; ( ii ) @xmath243 and @xmath244 ; or ( iii ) @xmath245 and @xmath246 ; or ( iv ) @xmath247 , then the endpoints of @xmath248 and @xmath249 alternate .",
    "therefore , if either @xmath250 and @xmath251 , or @xmath252 and @xmath253 , then @xmath248 and @xmath249 cross each other .",
    "therefore there is an injection from the set of all pairs @xmath129 of integers that satisfy the condition in the definition of @xmath254 $ ] , to the set of crossings that involve an edge in @xmath255 and an edge in @xmath256 ; that is , @xmath257 $ ] .    similarly ,",
    "if @xmath239 occurs to the right of @xmath240 , then @xmath258 $ ] .    now",
    "if @xmath259 ( respectively , @xmath260 ) , then @xmath239 necessarily occurs to the left ( respectively , to the right ) of @xmath240 , and so it follows that @xmath257 = q_{\\sigma\\tau}$ ] ( respectively , @xmath261 = q_{\\sigma\\tau}$ ] ) , as required . finally , if @xmath262 , then @xmath239 can be either to the right or to the left of @xmath240 . in the first case ,",
    "@xmath257 $ ] , while in the second case @xmath263 $ ] .",
    "thus , in this case , @xmath264,[\\tau,\\sigma]\\}=q_{\\sigma\\tau}$ ] , as required .",
    "consider now any fixed @xmath4-page drawing @xmath197 of @xmath0 .",
    "for each type @xmath265 , let @xmath266 denote the number of red vertices whose type in @xmath197 is @xmath267 , let @xmath268 , and let @xmath269 be the vector @xmath270 .",
    "it follows immediately from proposition  [ pro : startype ] that the number @xmath271 of crossings in @xmath197 satisfies @xmath272    where for the last inequality we use that @xmath273 and that @xmath274 \\le { m \\choose 2}$ ] .",
    "the derived inequality holds for every @xmath4-page drawing @xmath197 of @xmath0 , and so in particular for a crossing - minimal drawing .",
    "thus , if we let @xmath275 denote the standard simplex in @xmath276 , then we obtain    @xmath277    we may therefore obtain a lower bound on @xmath191 for some fixed @xmath169 ( we will be particularly interested in the case @xmath278 ) , by solving the standard quadratic programming problem @xmath279    the standard quadratic programming problem is np - hard in general , and we will only compute a lower bound on the minimum via semidefinite programming , as explained in the next section .",
    "the usual semidefinite programming relaxation of problem  ( [ eq : qp ] ) takes the form @xmath280 where @xmath281 is the all - ones matrix , and @xmath282 means that @xmath283 is entrywise nonnegative .",
    "we observe that the first equality is due to the duality theory of semidefinite programming .    due to the special structure of @xmath149",
    ", we may again use symmetry reduction to reduce the size of these problems . to this end , for odd @xmath169 , we may order the rows and columns of @xmath149 to obtain a block matrix consisting of circulant blocks of order @xmath284 .",
    "( thus there are @xmath285 rows / columns of blocks ) .",
    "the ordering of rows works as follows : we first define a group action on the set types@xmath216 . for ease of notation",
    "we now represent the elements of types@xmath216 as @xmath286 , with @xmath287 and @xmath288 , i.e.  we now number the @xmath169 vertices from @xmath289 to @xmath290 , and omit the set @xmath291 ( which is redundant in the description since it is the complement of @xmath292 ) .",
    "the group in question is generated by the following two elements , a flip : @xmath293 and a cyclic shift : @xmath294 note that @xmath295 and @xmath296 commute and therefore generate an abelian group of order @xmath284 .",
    "if @xmath169 is odd , then @xmath297 generates the entire group , i.e.  in this case we obtain the cyclic group of order @xmath284 .",
    "indeed , the order of @xmath298 equals the least common multiple of the orders of @xmath295 and @xmath296 , namely @xmath284 if @xmath169 is odd .",
    "also note that @xmath299 i.e.  the crossing number of a 2-page drawing does not change if we flip the drawing along its spine , or , in the circular model , rotate the drawing .",
    "finally , we group together the @xmath284 elements of types@xmath216 that belong to a given orbit of the group , to obtain @xmath300 circulant blocks .",
    "in what follows , we denote the first row of the @xmath300 circulant block @xmath129 by @xmath301 .",
    "[ lemma : reformulation sdp2 ] for odd @xmath169 , the semidefinite programming bound ( [ eq : spb ] ) may be reformulated as @xmath302 subject to @xmath303    the proof is similar to that of lemma [ lemma : reformulation sdp ] and is therefore omitted .",
    "a few remarks on the semidefinite programming reformulation in lemma [ lemma : reformulation sdp2 ] :    * as in lemma [ lemma : reformulation sdp ] , the constraints involve hermitian ( complex ) linear matrix inequalities .",
    "* the reduced problem has @xmath284 linear matrix inequalities involving @xmath304 matrices . by comparison ,",
    "the original problem had one linear matrix inequality involving a @xmath305 nonnegative matrix .",
    "as a result , the reformulation in lemma [ lemma : reformulation sdp2 ] may be solved for larger values of @xmath169 than the original formulation ( see next section ) .",
    "*   similarly to lemma [ lemma : reformulation sdp ] , every feasible point @xmath306 @xmath307 yields a certificate of lower bound on @xmath308 , and consequently a certificate of a lower bound on @xmath191 , by ( [ eq : genbound ] ) .",
    "using the reformulation in lemma  [ lemma : reformulation sdp2 ] , we showed numerically that @xmath309 .",
    "computation was done on a dell precision t7500 workstation with 92 gb of ram memory , using the semidefinite programming solver sdpt3  @xcite under matlab 7 together with the matlab package yalmip  @xcite .",
    "the running time was @xmath310 seconds .",
    "sdpt3 was chosen since it can deal with hermitian matrix variables .",
    "we recall that @xmath313 , and that @xmath314 ( since there are @xmath4-page drawings of @xmath315 with exactly @xmath316 crossings ) .",
    "using these observations and ( [ eq : k7n ] ) , theorem  [ thm : main1 ] follows for @xmath14 .",
    "having said that , the figure also shows a trend of diminishing returns  by extrapolating the curve in the figure , it seems that it may not be possible to improve the constant to more than @xmath323 , say , through computation of @xmath322 , if @xmath324 .     another possibility to improve",
    "the constant is to compute @xmath325 for larger values of @xmath169 than @xmath326 , by solving the maximum cut problem in lemma [ lem : reform ] .",
    "if , for example , one could verify in this way that @xmath327 , then this would yield the constant @xmath328 , by claim [ cla : claima ] .    regarding the computational lower bound on @xmath46 : it is interesting to note that the sdp bound @xmath308 provided a tight asymptotic bound on @xmath46 for @xmath329 and @xmath330 .",
    "a similar sdp bound used in @xcite and @xcite did not provide a tight asymptotic bound on the usual crossing number @xmath48 , not even for @xmath331 .",
    "our results therefore suggest that one may be able to prove computationally that @xmath332 for ( fixed ) odd values of @xmath333 .",
    "having said that , for @xmath334 , the resulting semidefinite program was too large for us to compute @xmath335 .",
