    "the study of semiconductor spintronics@xcite has caused a lot of attention since long spin lifetime and large spin transport distance have been observed in @xmath0-type semiconductors,@xcite due to the great potential of the device applications such as quantum memory devices , spin valves and spin transistors .",
    "high spin injection efficiency and long spin diffusion / transport distance are two prerequisites of realizing these devices and have been widely studied both experimentally@xcite and theoretically.@xcite many works are focused on improving the spin injection efficiency by electrical method.@xcite others are concentrated on the spin diffusion / transport inside the semiconductors without taking care of the injection . @xcite in the latter case , the spin polarization can be prepared by optical excitations.@xcite a number of theories have been developed to study the spin transport , such as the two - component drift - diffusion model,@xcite the kinetic spin bloch equation approach,@xcite the monte - carlo simulation,@xcite and the microscopic semiclassical approach.@xcite in these theories , weng and wu showed that the correlations between the spin - up and -down states , _",
    "i.e. _ , the off - diagonal terms of the density matrix in spin space , play an essential role in spin diffusion / transport.@xcite by constructing the kinetic spin bloch equations by means of the non - equilibrium green function method and numerically solving these equations with the scattering explicitly included , they predicted spin oscillations along the spin diffusion in the absence of the magnetic field@xcite which can not be obtained from the two - component drift - diffusion model .",
    "these oscillations were later observed in experiments.@xcite now most of the theoretical works include the off - diagonal terms.@xcite    another important consequence of the off - diagonal terms is that they allow spin to precess along the effective magnetic field which origins from the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) and is momentum dependent . the fact that spin with different momentum precesses with different frequency is referred to as inhomogeneous broadening.@xcite it was shown by wu _",
    "_ in the spacial uniform systems that in the presence of the inhomogeneous broadening , any spin conserving scattering , including the coulomb scattering , can cause irreversible spin relaxation / dephasing ( r / d).@xcite later weng and wu extended this concept to the spacial inhomogeneous systems and showed that the spin with different momentum precesses with different frequencies during the diffusion along the spacial gradient , thanks to the off - diagonal term.@xcite this serves as additional inhomogeneous broadening and can cause additional spin r / d combined with the spin conserving scattering.@xcite    in our previous works , we have studied both the transient@xcite and the steady - state@xcite spin diffusion / transport in gaas quantum well ( qw ) using the kinetic spin bloch equations , first without@xcite and then with@xcite the coulomb scattering . the other scattering such as electron - phonon and electron - impurity scattering is explicitly included . by solving the kinetic spin bloch equations combined with the poisson equation , one is able to obtain the mobility , diffusion length and spin injection length without any fitting parameter . moreover , this approach is valid not only for systems near the equilibrium , but also for those far away from the equilibrium such as systems under strong external electric field ( hot - electron effect ) and/or with large spin polarization .",
    "it is also applicable to systems in both the strong scattering regime and the weak one.@xcite nevertheless , in our previous investigation of the steady - state spin transport,@xcite the boundary conditions we used are the single - side ones , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath2 are given from the single side of the sample regardless of the sign of @xmath3 , with @xmath4 representing the density matrix elements .",
    "this is an approximation as in principal @xmath5 for @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) can only be determined from the right ( left ) side of @xmath8 . moreover , by using this boundary conditions , the grid of the space has to be very small due to the reason specified in the next section .",
    "therefore the length of the sample we studied before is very short , even less than one oscillation period , as the numerical calculation is too time - consuming.@xcite it is therefore also almost impossible to discuss situations such as spin transport under strong external electric fields . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the double - side boundary conditions which are widely used in the charge transport,@xcite _",
    "i.e. _ , using @xmath9 and @xmath10 as boundary conditions with @xmath7 and @xmath11 standing for the right side of the sample . we further develop new numerical scheme to solve the kinetic equations with all the scattering included .",
    "this allows us to solve the spin diffusion / transport with fast speed and high accuracy .",
    "we therefore study the spin diffusion / transport with large sample scale under various conditions such as temperature , well width , magnetic field and electric field .",
    "the hot - electron effect to the spin transport is also discussed in detail .",

    "we only include the electron - electron and electron  lo - phonon scattering .",
    "it is easy to find that when there is no / weak scattering , spin precession frequencies and spin diffusion velocities with different momentum show different values .",

    "the similar results have been obtained in the time domain.@xcite in fact , even for the case @xmath140",
    "@xmath96 and @xmath141  k , the intrinsic scattering is already strong enough to ensure this behavior .",

    "scattering tends to suppress this inhomogeneous broadening and to make it a homogeneous one .",
    "our result indicates that the intrinsic scattering ( the electron - electron and electron - phonon scattering ) is already strong enough to totally suppress the inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "the spin polarizations for different @xmath25 all precess with single frequency @xmath143 when @xmath120 .",

    "moreover , it is seen from the figure that besides the counter effect of the scattering to the inhomogeneous broadening , it also causes irreversible spin r / d.@xcite in the steady state , there is no spin relaxation for each @xmath25 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution](b ) in the absence of any scattering .",
    "whereas strong spin relaxation is observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution](a ) in the presence of unscaled intrinsic scattering .",
    "finally the scattering also affects the total spin polarization at the left boundary in the steady state .",

    "the total spin polarization eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) is determined by the contributions from both @xmath7 and @xmath6 . without scattering ,",
    "the spin polarization for @xmath6 is always zero [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : noscat ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution](b ) ] .",
    "therefore , the total spin polarization is only one half of 5  % at the left boundary .",
    "the scattering transfers spin polarization from states of @xmath7",
    ". therefore , the larger the scattering , the closer the total spin polarization approaches the boundary condition : @xmath148  % for @xmath131 and @xmath149  % for @xmath150 .",
    "we believe that the spin polarization at the left boundary can be very close to @xmath151  % for sufficiently strong scattering .",
    "in such a case , the spin injection with double - side boundary conditions can be approximated by the single - side boundary conditions used in our previous papers.@xcite however , for small spin polarizations , the spin injection properties such as the spin diffusion length and the spin precession period are not determined by the initial spin polarization at the boundary .",
    "as shown in the previous subsection that the scattering plays a crucial role when the electron diffuse / transport into the 2deg , we now study the effect of the scattering on the total spin signal . in fig .",

    "i.e. _ , the spin polarization at the left boundary always increases with the strengthening of the scattering , either the strengthening is due to the addition of more scattering or due to the increase of temperature .",

    "it has been pointed out by weng and wu that the magnetic field plays a different role in spin diffusion / transport from the time - domain spin precession in the spacial uniform case.@xcite in the spin precession in the time domain , the magnetic field alone without the dp term will not cause any spin r / d due to the absence of inhomogeneous broadening.@xcite whereas in spin diffusion / transport , as the inhomogeneous broadening is caused by @xmath170 which reads @xmath171 in the absence of the dp term and still provides an inhomogeneous broadening leading to the spin r / d.@xcite furthermore , from eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) one finds that the inhomogeneous broadening caused by the applied magnetic field depends on the direction of the magnetic field when it is combined with the inhomogeneous broadening caused by the effective magnetic field @xmath172 .",
    "therefore different direction of the magnetic field yields different spin diffusion length .",
    "we reveal the magnetic field effect on the steady - state spin diffusion by plotting in fig .",
    "[ fig : b ] the spin diffusion length @xmath117 and the spin oscillation period @xmath173 , fitted from the calculated spin polarization along the @xmath13-direction by @xmath174 , as function of the applied magnetic field at @xmath141  k. the direction of the magnetic field is either vertical ( along the @xmath17-axis ) or parallel ( along the @xmath16-axis ) to the diffusion direction .",
    "one finds from the figure that the magnetic field leads to additional spin r / d and therefore the spin diffusion length decreases with the magnetic field , regardless of the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "however , it is interesting to see that the spin diffusion length has different symmetry when the magnetic field is vertical or parallel to the spin diffusion direction : when @xmath175 is parallel to the @xmath17-axis , @xmath176 ; however , when @xmath175 is parallel to the @xmath16-axis , @xmath177 .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the density matrices from the kinetic spin bloch equations  ( [ eq : beq ] ) have the symmetry @xmath178 when @xmath175 is along the @xmath17-axis .",
    "this symmetry is broken if @xmath175 is along the @xmath16-axis .",
    "differing from the magnetic field dependence of the spin diffusion length , the spin oscillation period @xmath173 decreases monotonically with the vertical magnetic field , regardless the direction of the field .",
    "however @xmath173 increases with the parallel magnetic field when the field is along the diffusion direction and less than 4  t ( the spin precession disappears when the field is larger than 4  t ) but @xmath173 increases with the magnetic field when it is anti - parallel to the diffusion direction .",
    "the spacial period is determined by @xmath179 with @xmath180 being along the @xmath16-axis .",
    "@xmath181 represents the average of @xmath3 due to the spin gradient and can be roughly estimated by @xmath182 , which is a positive value due to the presence of the spin gradient .",
    "for the vertical magnetic field , @xmath180 and @xmath183 are perpendicular to each other , so the magnitude of the spin oscillation period is determined by @xmath184^{-1}$ ] which always decreases with the magnetic field .",
    "however , for the parallel one , these two vectors are in the same direction and the period is determined by @xmath185 .",
    "so the period increases with the magnetic field .",
    "moreover , it is interesting to see that when @xmath186  4  t , @xmath187 and further increasing of the magnetic field does not lead to any spin oscillation due to the too large inhomogeneous broadening caused by the magnetic field .",
    "we now turn to study the electric field effect on spin transport .",
    "an external electric field is applied along the @xmath16-axis . when the electric field is large enough ,",
    "the spin transport is then in the hot - electron regime .",
    "it has been shown in our previous investigation@xcite in the spacial homogeneous case that the spin precession in the time domain is markedly affected by the electric field .",
    "especially an effective magnetic field @xmath188 , which is proportional to the electric field , is induced by the electric field combined with the dp term due to the center - of - mass drift velocity @xmath189 ( and hence @xmath190 ) driven by the electric field , with @xmath108 representing the mobility .",
    "this effective magnetic field leads to a spin precession in the absence of any magnetic field and the precession frequency changes with the variation of the electric field.@xcite one may therefore expect that now in spin transport , the spacial spin oscillation period is also proportional to the electric field .",
    "this is _ not _ the case as again @xmath3 in the spin diffusion terms , _",
    "i.e. _ , the third terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : beq ] ) , plays an important role in the spin diffusion / transport and consequently the spacial oscillation period @xmath191 is _ independent _ on @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , in spin transport the electric field can not induce an additional spacial spin precession .",
    "it is further expected that in the steady state , @xmath181 is now determined by both the drift velocity and the spin gradient .",
    "therefore , if the electric field @xmath192 ( @xmath193 ) , @xmath181 is reduced ( enhanced ) by the electric field and the spin diffusion length depends on the direction of the electric field .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : e ] the spin density @xmath194 in the steady state is plotted against the position @xmath16 at different electric fields @xmath195 , 0 , @xmath196 and @xmath197  kv / cm with only the intrinsic scattering included at @xmath141  k. it is seen from the figure that the spin oscillation period is almost unchanged when the electric field varies from @xmath197  kv / cm to 0.5  kv / cm .",
    "this is consistent with the latest experimental observation in bulk system.@xcite it is further noticed from the figure that the spin diffusion length is markedly affected by the electric field . to reveal this effect ,",
    "the spin diffusion length is plotted as function of electric field in the same figure .",
    "one finds when the electric field varies from @xmath197  kv / cm to @xmath198  kv / cm , the spin diffusion length decreases monotonically .",
    "this can be easily understood from the fact that when an electric field is applied along @xmath199-direction ( @xmath200-direction ) , the drift velocity caused by the electric field is along the @xmath16-direction ( @xmath199-direction ) , which enhances ( cancels ) the velocity driven by the spin gradient .",
    "therefore , @xmath181 is increased ( reduced ) and the inhomogeneous broadening is decreased ( enhanced ) .",
    "a longer ( shorter ) spin diffusion length is then observed .",
    "in summary , we have performed a theoretical investigation on the spin diffusion / transport in @xmath0-type gaas qws at high temperatures ( @xmath1  k ) by setting up and numerically solving the kinetic spin bloch equations together with the poisson equation , with all the scattering explicitly included .",
    "a new numerical scheme is developed which can solve the kinetic equations with high accuracy and speed .",
    "the spin r / d mechanism in the spin diffusion / transport is due to the inhomogeneous broadening , combined with the spin conserving scattering .",
    "differing from the spin precession in the spacial uniform system where the inhomogeneous broadening is caused only by the momentum - dependent effective magnetic field due to the soc , in spin diffusion / transport , the inhomogeneous broadening is caused additionally by the momentum dependence in the spin diffusion rate and therefore even the magnetic field alone can lead to spin r / d . due to the joint effects from the momentum - dependence in the diffusion rate and the momentum dependence in the dresselhaus effective magnetic field , there are spin oscillations along the spin diffusion even in the absence of the external magnetic field .",
    "the period of these spacial spin oscillations can be affected by the temperature , the well width and the electron density , but is independent on the external electric field .",
    "it increases when an additional scattering is added or the temperature / the well width is increased .",
    "moreover , it is shown that when the scattering is strong enough , the spin oscillations of electrons at different momentum @xmath25 show the _ same _ period .",
    "in fact , the intrinsic scattering , _",
    "i.e. _ , the electron - electron and the electron  lo - phonon scattering is already strong enough to lead to this effect .",
    "this indicates that during the spin diffusion , there is no interference - induced spin dephasing and @xmath139 .",
    "it is shown that the coulomb scattering makes marked contribution to the spin r / d in the spin diffusion / transport .",
    "it is especially important in the hot - electron case as it provides the important mechanism of thermalization .",
    "the scattering , the temperature , the qw width , the magnetic field and the electric field dependence of the spin diffusion length and the spacial spin oscillation period are explored in detail .",
    "it is shown that in the weak scattering regime , the spin diffusion length decreases if a new scattering is added into the system , while in the strong scattering regime , it increases . in the temperature regime we are interested in , the spin diffusion length decreases with the temperature .",
    "moreover , it increases with the increase of the qw width as the inhomogeneous broadening decreases with the well width but decreases with the external magnetic field as the later adds a new inhomogeneous broadening into the system .",
    "the external electric field can effectively prolong or suppress the spin diffusion length depending on whether the electric field is antiparallel or parallel to the spin diffusion direction .",
    "we believe this investigation is useful for the understanding of the spin transport as well as the design of the spintronic device .",
