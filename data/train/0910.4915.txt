    "in recent years , there has been a growing recognition that processes at the ecological and evolutionary scales can be strongly linked @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "several approaches have been proposed , which model the complex process of coevolution in a fitness landscape that changes with the composition of the community , while spanning wide ranges of both temporal and taxonomic scales .",
    "early steps in this direction were simulations of parapatric and sympatric speciation @xcite and the coupled @xmath1 model with population dynamics @xcite .",
    "more recent contributions include the webworld model @xcite , the simple origination / extinction model of @xcite , the speciation model of @xcite , the matching model of @xcite , the family of models introduced by @xcite , the individual - based tangled - nature model @xcite and simplified versions of the latter @xcite , as well as network models @xcite .",
    "recently , large individual - based simulations have also been performed of parapatric and sympatric speciation @xcite and of adaptive radiation @xcite .    many of the models mentioned above are deliberately simple , aiming to elucidate _",
    "universal _ features that are largely independent of the finer details of the ecological interactions and the evolutionary mechanisms . while valuable from this point of view , the departure of many such models from mechanisms usually included in models of population dynamics and evolution has limited their acceptance in the biological community .",
    "a case in point are the tangled - nature model @xcite and its simplifications @xcite . here",
    ", we therefore introduce a modification of the latter , in which intra- and interspecific competition and adaptive foraging are introduced through ratio - dependent functional response functions .",
    "our motivation for this study is primarily a desire to understand the extent to which the long - time dynamics of complex coevolution models depend on details of the population dynamics . by using individual - based models with mutations ,",
    "we avoid introducing the artificial separation between speciations and population dynamics inherent in all species - level models , including those mentioned above @xcite . despite being individual - based , our models enable fast simulation of large communities over time scales of tens of millions of generations . an important question that one would like to answer in the future is whether the avalanche - like mass extinctions observed in the fossil record are due to intrinsic fluctuations of the nonlinear dynamics [ so - called self - organized criticality or soc @xcite ] , or to external perturbations such as asteroid impacts , volcanic eruptions , or climate changes , or to a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic causes @xcite . in order to successfully address this question ,",
    "it is necessary to understand better the influence that the population dynamics have on the intrinsic fluctuations in well - defined model systems .",
    "we find that the dynamics of the functional - response models studied in this paper differ from the tangled - nature type models studied earlier and also from each other , depending on whether or not adaptive foraging is implemented .",

    "in particular , the behaviors of mutualistic and predator - prey versions were compared by @xcite , and community structures of the latter were compared with data from real ecosystems by @xcite . here",
    "we first describe features of these models that are shared by the new models that will be introduced below .",
    "more detailed descriptions of our previous models are given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the mechanism for selection between several interacting species is provided by the reproduction rates in an individual - based population dynamics with nonoverlapping generations . at the end of each generation ,",
    "each individual of species @xmath2 reproduces asexually , giving birth to a fixed number @xmath3 of offspring with probability @xmath4 before dying , or it dies without offspring with probability @xmath5 .",
    "each @xmath4 depends on the set @xmath6 of population sizes of all the species resident in the community in generation @xmath7 through interspecies interactions and other model parameters as described below .",
    "the interactions are determined by the random _ interaction matrix _",
    "@xmath8 @xcite , which is constructed at the beginning of a simulation run , and thereafter kept constant . if @xmath9 is positive and @xmath10 negative , then @xmath2 is a predator and @xmath11 its prey , and vice versa .",
    "if both matrix elements are positive , the relationship is a mutualistic one , while both negative indicate an antagonistic relationship .",

    "new species enter the community as each offspring organism may mutate with a small probability @xmath15 .",
    "mutation consists in flipping a randomly chosen bit in the genome , and a mutated individual is assumed to belong to a different species than its parent , with different properties .",
    "genotype and phenotype are thus in one - to - one correspondence in these models .",
    "this is a highly idealized picture , which is introduced to maximize the pool of different species available within the computational resources .",

    "this model evolves toward mutualistic communities @xcite , in which all species are connected by asymmetric , mutually positive interactions @xcite .    in the predator - prey version of the model , a small minority of the potential species ( typically 5% )",
    "are primary producers , while the rest are consumers .",
    "the off - diagonal part of the interaction matrix is antisymmetric , with the additional restriction that a producer can not also prey on a consumer @xcite . in simulations we took @xmath24 and the nonzero @xmath25 as",
    "independent and uniformly distributed on @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "this model generates simple food webs with up to three trophic levels @xcite .",
    "both of these models provide interesting results , which include intermittent dynamics with power spectral densities ( psds ) of diversities and population sizes that exhibit approximate @xmath0 noise , as well as power - law distributions for the lifetimes of individual species and the duration of quiet periods of relative evolutionary stasis . from a theoretical point of view",
    "they also have the great advantage that the mean - field equation for the steady - state average population sizes , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mf ] ) , in the absence of mutations reduces to a set of quadratic equations ( linear if @xmath30 ) and thus can easily be solved exactly @xcite .",
    "the models thus provide useful benchmarks for more realistic , but generally highly nonlinear models , like the ones defined below .",
    "the population dynamics defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pi ] ) and  ( [ eq : delta ] ) have some less realistic features .",
    "in particular , by summing over positive and negative terms in @xmath22 , the models enable species with little food to remain near a steady state if they are also not very popular as prey , or have very low birth cost .",
    "another problem is the _ ad - hoc _ nature of the normalization by the total population size @xmath31 in the resource and interaction terms in @xmath22 .",
    "while this is the source of the models analytic solvability , it implies an indiscriminate , universal competition without regard to whether or not two species directly utilize the same resources or share a common predator .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to develop models with more realistic population dynamics and explore their complex dynamics on time scales from ecological ( short ) to evolutionary ( long ) .",
    "here we develop a model with population dynamics that include competition between different predators that prey on the same species , as well as intraspecific competition and a saturation effect expected to occur for a predator with abundant prey .",
    "in doing so , we retain from the models discussed above the important role of the interaction matrix @xmath8 , as well as the mutation process of the binary  genome \" and the restriction to nonoverlapping generations .",
    "we first deal with the competition between predator species by defining the number of individuals of @xmath11 that are available as prey for @xmath2 , corrected for competition from other predator species , as @xmath32 where @xmath33 runs over all @xmath12 such that @xmath34 , i.e. , over all predators of @xmath11 .",

    "however , it is reasonable to expect that the consumption rate should saturate in the presence of very abundant prey @xcite . for ecosystems consisting of a single pair of predator and prey , or a simple chain reaching from a bottom - level producer through intermediate species to a top predator ,",
    "the most common forms of functional response are due to holling @xcite . for more complicated , interconnected food webs",
    ", a number of functional forms have been proposed in the recent literature @xcite , but there is as yet no agreement about a standard form . here",
