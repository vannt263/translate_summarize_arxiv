    "a complete understanding of transport behavior in many - body systems is one of the utmost challenges in fundamental studies of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics . in the classical domain",
    ", it is widely believed that chaotic systems should show diffusive ( normal ) transport , whereas integrability should be associated with ballistic ( abnormal ) transport @xcite , although normal transport has also been verified for a non - chaotic system @xcite . in the quantum domain , the conditions that determine specific transport behaviors are still under debate , but here also , the main conjecture is of the correspondence integrable - ballistic and chaotic - diffusive @xcite .",
    "several theoretical approaches have been undertaken to address this issue , including : attempts to derive the fourier law from a microscopic foundation by applying the hilbert space average method @xcite and by numerically studying transport of heat in finite chaotic and non - chaotic systems coupled to heat reservoirs @xcite ; analysis of the transport behavior of local magnetization in isolated finite systems at zero temperature @xcite ; new advances toward the problem of quantum thermalization @xcite ; comparisons of the results for conductivity in integrable and chaotic systems at finite temperature and in the thermodynamic limit @xcite , a subject of intense discussion here being the possibility of ballistic transport in non - integrable quasi - one - dimensional systems @xcite ; numerical studies of spin diffusion at long times at infinity temperature @xcite ; as well as studies of transport properties near the metal - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "investigations of transport behavior in the particular case of quasi - one - dimensional spin-1/2 systems have been highly motivated by experiments in low - dimensional magnetic compounds , such as copper oxide ( cuprate ) systems , where ballistic behavior has been observed for heat conduction @xcite , and also for magnetization , as revealed by nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments @xcite .",
    "these compounds are described by models of interacting spins-1/2 arranged in structures such as chains , two - leg ladders , and square lattices @xcite .",
    "clean spin-1/2 heisenberg chains with only nearest - neighbor interactions are integrable models solved with the bethe ansatz method @xcite , whereas two - dimensional lattices are chaotic @xcite and two - leg spin ladder systems become chaotic when the interchain and intrachain interactions are of the same order @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , an isolated isotropic finite spin-1/2 heisenberg chain at zero temperature and with only nearest - neighbor interactions was considered in the analysis of transport of local magnetization in both cases : when the system was clean and therefore integrable , and when random on - site disorder led to the onset of quantum chaos .",
    "free boundary conditions were assumed .",
    "a bouncing behavior of the local magnetization was observed in the integrable regime and interpreted as a hint of ballistic transport , whereas for the chaotic system the local magnetization showed an exponential relaxation to equilibrium , which was considered a reflection of diffusive transport .",
    "the first part of this paper is also dedicated to the investigation of transport of local magnetization in spin-1/2 heisenberg systems , but different ways to induce chaos are dealt with . the goal is to resolve whether non - integrability may have a unique correspondence with the exponential decay verified in @xcite .",
    "the integrability - breaking terms considered are : on - site disorder described either by ( i ) randomly distributed zeeman energies @xcite or by ( ii ) a few defects placed on specific positions of the chain @xcite ; and couplings to more surrounding spins such as ( iii ) next - nearest neighbor interactions and ( iv ) interchain interactions , as typical of two - leg spin ladder systems .",
    "an exponential decay is observed only for ( i ) and ( iv ) . for the finite systems studied ,",
    "few defects lead to a behavior that sometimes resembles localization , the exponential behavior appearing only under very special conditions , while next - nearest neighbor interactions generate oscillations of the local magnetization that are similar to those seen for the integrable system , although faster .",
    "these observations support the conjecture that chaos might not be a sufficient condition for normal transport .",
    "the second part of this work focuses on the analysis of methods of coherent quantum control , the so - called dynamical decoupling ( dd ) schemes , as potential tools to manipulate transport behavior .",
    "dd schemes consist of sequences of external control operations that average out unwanted contributions to the system hamiltonian .",
    "these methods have long been applied in nmr spectroscopy @xcite , where the goal is to modify the nuclear spin hamiltonian to eliminate or scale selected internal interactions .",
    "more recently , dd has addressed the removal of interactions between the target system and its environment @xcite and has been put in a general control - theoretic framework @xcite .",
    "it has also been considered in studies of transport of information @xcite . here",
    ", we introduce dd sequences that suppress the effects of terms leading to quantum chaos , the purpose being the approach to the ballistic transport behavior verified for the integrable system .",

    "ii explains how the identification of the chaotic regime is performed and describes the models to be considered .",
    "iii presents the results for the transport of local magnetization for systems in different regimes .",
    "iv introduces dd sequences to control transport behavior and shows , as an illustration , results for the sequence that cancels the effects of on - site disorder .",
    "concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "for quantum systems , chaos may be identified by analyzing the distribution of spacings @xmath0 between neighboring energy levels @xcite .",
    "quantum levels of integrable systems tend to cluster and are not prohibited from crossing , the typical distribution is poissonian :    @xmath1    in contrast , non - integrable systems show levels that are correlated and crossings are strongly resisted , the level statistics is given by the wigner - dyson distribution .",
    "the exact form of the distribution depends on the symmetry properties of the hamiltonian . in the case of systems with time reversal invariance",

    "the decay is not exponential and @xmath84 is never reached , most up - spins tending to localize in the first half of the chain .",
