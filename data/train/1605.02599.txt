    "most of the theoretical work on atomic ionization by an intense and short laser pulse can be related to the strong field approximation ( sfa ) approach @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . according to this theory ,",
    "after ionization takes place , the emitted electron evolves under the interaction with the laser field radiation .",
    "this theory has proved to be appropriate to deal with the detachment problem , in which the ionized electron is emitted by a negative ion which , after ionization takes place , becomes a neutral atom @xcite . in this case",
    "the photoelectron once ionized evolves only under the interaction with the laser field .",
    "however , the theory has been formulated under the assumption that no appreciable depletion of the system initial state takes place owing to the laser field @xcite .    for neutral atom ionization ,",
    "a closely related theory has been formulated to account for the long range coulomb interaction in the final state , namely , the so called coulomb - volkov approximation ( cv2@xmath0 ) @xcite . according to this theory ,",
    "after ionization has taken place , the emitted electron evolves under both the interactions with the residual ion and the laser radiation .",
    "the spectra obtained with the cv2@xmath0 approximation has been obtained for the case in which the laser frequency is greater than the ionization potential and for not too strong laser fields amplitudes .",
    "the cv2@xmath0 approach provides an accurate description of the ionization spectra and , in particular , it accounts for the ati peaks of the spectrum when the mentioned conditions hold and the laser frequency is larger than the ionization potential .",
    "when the laser frequency is lower than the ionization potential , a modified version of cv2@xmath0 @xcite provides the correct description of the physical ionization process , but the theory still fails under strongly non perturbative conditions .",
    "several works that treat the strong laser field in a non - perturbative way , have been published @xcite .    in order to abandon the perturbative conditions ,",
    "the different theories have based their models on the inclusion of the depletion of the initial atomic state that occurs when the stronger laser fields are taken into consideration .    the depletion of the initial state allows for the quick transfer to the continuum of the population of the initial state and the posterior rescattering process that characterizes the ionization regimes at higher laser field intensities .    for instance , the results obtained with the renormalized cv2@xmath0 theory @xcite , have been able to correct the magnitude of the spectrum , _ i.e. _ , the magnitude of the principal and secondary ati peaks and the background computed from the cv2@xmath0 theory .",
    "the spectra computed with the original cv2@xmath0 theory has shown to be considerably improved after the renormalization process .",
    "unfortunately , the theory neglects the initial state coupling with other discrete states , and a weiskopf - wigner approximation was employed @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the theory proposed in @xcite , accounts for the depletion of the initial atomic state by including the coupling between the initial state and the continuum states of the atom .",
    "however the authors oversimplify the problem in order to make the calculation as analytical as possible .",
    "thus , a simple model for the coupling between the initial state with the continuum and discrete part of the spectrum was proposed , though the continuum - continuum coupling is considered in the model .",
    "again , no other discrete states are considered .",
    "the present alternative approach uses real coupling matrix elements",
    ". we will show the model to be unitary .",
    "the model is computed in the velocity gauge , and the probability amplitudes of the states involved are obtained from the exact solution of the resulting integro - differential equation ( ide ) after the main approximations of the model are applied to the initial system of differential equations in the transitions amplitudes .",
    "we have tested the model for non - perturbative situations where the strength of the field has been raised to levels of the order of the atomic unity .    in this paper we focus on the case in which the photon energy is greater than the ionization potential , and leave the case in which the photon energy is lower than the ionization potential , where the resonance phenomenon has to be taken into account , to be considered in further work .    in section",
    "ii we present the theory behind the present unitary model . in section",
    "iii we present the results obtained with the model for the case where the photon energy is greater than the ionization potential and compare them with exact time dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) simulations . sec .",
    "iv presents some of our conclusions .",

    "<S> exact numerical solutions of this equation are computed and compared with the full time dependent schrdinger equation solution for hydrogen atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the initial state amplitude is well described by two versions of the model : with and without the continuum - continuum coupling model . </S>",
    "<S> however the electron energy spectrum is only well described when the model accounts for the coupling between continuum states . </S>",
    "<S> improvement on sfa arise from using coulomb final wave function as well as regarding the initial state probability depletion . </S>"
