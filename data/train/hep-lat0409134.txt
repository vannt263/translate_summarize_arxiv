    "for over fifteen years the algorithm of choice for generating lattice field theory configurations including the dynamical effect of fermions has been hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the cost of this algorithm increases rapidly as the fermion mass @xmath1 decreases ; in order to keep the  acceptance rate @xmath2 constant the  integration step size @xmath3 has to be reduced , and for  trajectories of length @xmath4 this corresponds directly to an increased number of integration steps and hence larger cost .",
    "this required decrease in step size is because of the breakdown of symmetric symplectic integrators . for light dynamical fermions",
    "there is an instability for a few isolated light fermion modes , whose frequency is well separated from the bulk of the modes .",
    "this instability is seen to be directly responsible for the exponential decrease of  acceptance with integration step size above some critical value .",
    "we introduce a method for reducing the severity of this problem by reducing the highest `` effective frequency '' of the fermionic modes , or equivalently of decreasing the magnitude of the fermionic contribution to the force acting on the gauge fields .",
    "the basic idea follows the suggestion of hasenbusch  @xcite to split the fermionic action into two parts , and to introduce separate pseudofermion fields for each part .",
    "our approach can be easily generalised to an arbitrary number of pseudofermion fields .",
    "we observe that the force due to the fermion kernel @xmath5 is dominated by the smallest eigenvalues of @xmath6 .",
    "the condition number @xmath7 is the ratio of the largest eigenvalue to the smallest eigenvalue , and to a first approximation controls the rate of convergence of iterative krylov space solvers .",
    "the largest eigenvalue remains approximately constant as the fermion mass @xmath1 is decreased , and the smallest eigenvalue is typically of the order @xmath8 where @xmath9 is @xmath10 or  @xmath11 , so we expect @xmath12 .",
    "consider the numerical solution of the linear system @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and has condition number @xmath7 .",
    "the cost of solving these linear equations is proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "on the other hand we could equivalently solve the set of coupled linear equations @xmath16 and @xmath17 , each of which has condition number @xmath18 , the positive square root is uniquely defined . ] leading to a cost of order @xmath19 in this case , which is cheaper for sufficiently small @xmath1 .",
    "this reflects the essential non - linearity of krylov space solvers .",
    "indeed , we may even be more adventurous and solve the set of @xmath0 coupled systems @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 , for which we have to perform @xmath0 solves each with condition number @xmath23 , leading to a total cost of order @xmath24 .",
    "unfortunately we can not take advantage of this non - linearity , the problem being that it is not straightforward to apply @xmath25 to a vector when @xmath6 is not serendipitously a manifest square .",
    "there are efficient techniques for evaluating matrix functions , such as computing the optimal polynomial or rational chebyshev approximation to the function over the spectrum of the matrix @xcite . for the rational case the approximations",
    "may be found using the remez algorithm , and they usually converge exponentially in the degree of the rational function . in practice only a relatively low degree rational function is needed to achieve machine floating - point precision @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "if we take a rational approximation then we can express it as a partial fraction , and apply all the terms simultaneously ( in the same krylov space ) using a multi - shift solver .",
    "this reduces the cost of solving @xmath26 to about the same cost as solving @xmath27 .",
    "this in turn is expected to be proportional to the condition number @xmath7 .",
    "sadly , this means that the cost of the proposed method is of order @xmath28 rather than @xmath24 , and we are worse off than when we started .",
    "although this method is clearly useless to accelerate the convergence of krylov space solvers , it still does significantly reduce the condition number of each of the @xmath0 solves , and this is what we shall make use of to decrease the pseudofermionic force .",
    "indeed , we expect the force to be of order @xmath29 , which is small compared to @xmath30 for large @xmath7 .",
    "a nave calculation minimising @xmath31 leads to the conclusion that the optimal number of pseudofermion fields should be , so it must be either @xmath32 or @xmath33 . ]",
    "recall that we represent the fermion determinant as a pseudofermion gaussian functional integral , @xmath35 , and then select a single equilibrium pseudofermion configuration using a gaussian heatbath .",
    "we expect , therefore , that the variance of this stochastic estimate of the fermion determinant will lead to statistical fluctuations in the fermionic force : in other words the pseudofermionic force may be larger than the exact fermionic force , which is the functional derivative @xmath36 with respect to the gauge field @xmath37 .",
    "this means that the pseudofermionic force may trigger the instability in the symplectic integrator even though the exact fermionic force would not .",
    "an obvious way of ameliorating this effect is to use @xmath38 pseudofermion fields ( which we shall call _ multipseudofermions _ ) to sample the functional integral representing the fermion determinant , and this is achieved simply by writing @xmath39^n \\nonumber \\\\    & \\propto & \\prod_{j=1}^n d\\phi_j\\ , d\\phi^\\dagger_j\\ ,      \\exp{\\left(-\\phi^\\dagger_j\\m^{-1/n}\\phi_j",
    "\\right ) } ;    \\label{eq : multipseudo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that is , introducing @xmath0 pseudofermion fields @xmath40 each with kernel @xmath41",
    ".    we may now follow a similar argument to that in  [ sec : cg ] to estimate the optimal value for @xmath0 .",
    "we must keep the maximum force fixed so as to avoid the instability in the integrator , so we may increase the integration step size to @xmath42 such that @xmath43 . at constant trajectory length , and hence constant autocorrelation time , the cost of an trajectory is proportional to the step size , and thus is minimised by choosing @xmath0 so as to minimise @xmath44 , which leads to the condition @xmath45 , corresponding to cost reduction by a factor of @xmath46 .",
    "our method is to apply the  algorithm @xcite to generate gauge field and pseudofermion configurations distributed according to the probability density @xmath47},\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the bosonic ( pure gauge ) action and @xmath49 .",
    "optimal rational approximations are used to evaluate these matrix functions , and we proceed as we would for conventional  @xcite . using a multi - shift solver",
    "the computational cost is very similar to , with the additional overhead of having to perform a matrix inversion to evaluate the heatbath .",
    "we have performed tests of the algorithm using small lattices with four flavours of nave staggered fermions . as well as being the least computationally demanding simulations to perform",
    ", the improvement for such systems should be a lower bound on the improvement for large volume and/or wilson type fermion simulations , where the fermion matrix is less well - conditioned .",
    "the @xmath50 case runs were performed using conventional , and the @xmath38 runs using .",
    "we define an efficiency measure @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is number of krylov solves performed per trajectory . for  this",
    "is given by @xmath53 and for  by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the trajectory length and @xmath3 the step size .",
    "the additional inversion per field for  is for the pseudofermion heatbath .",
    "= 0.45    -6ex    figure [ fig : eff - dt-1 ] is a plot of the efficiency against step size for various value of @xmath0 .",
    "the conjecture that there is some optimal value of @xmath0 is confirmed , and it can be seen that @xmath56 is the value for this particular lattice .",
    "it represents an increase in efficiency of 33% ( @xmath56 peak divided by @xmath50 peak ) .",
    "we have conducted the same test with a mass parameter of @xmath57 , which shows the same optimal value of @xmath0 , but with a substantial efficiency increase of @xmath58 .",
    "this confirms that the improvement factor increases as less well - conditioned systems are studied .",
    "we have demonstrated that our method for accelerating the monte carlo acceptance test improves the efficiency over conventional .",
    "this is clearly still a very preliminary study , and shall be extended to large scale systems for both and domain wall simulations using . on such systems , we would expect the improvement in efficiency to increase , and it will be interesting to see how much improvement can be gained",
    ". it would also be interesting to compare our method with that proposed by hasenbusch in  @xcite .",
