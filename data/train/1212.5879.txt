    "this is called resonant andreev reflections in ref .",
    ". however , when the two majorana fermions are strongly coupled with @xmath153 , the local andreev reflection is strongly suppressed .",
    "it is interesting to note that when @xmath154 , the local andreev reflection amplitude is @xmath155 and results in a conductance peak of @xmath156 .",
    "all these simple analytic results match the numerical results in the corresponding regime very well , as shown in fig.2b of the main text .",
    "for example , in the main text , the effective coupling between the leads to the superconductor are set to be equal such that @xmath157 and the effective hamiltonian predicts a conductance peak of @xmath158 at @xmath65 .",
    "this is verified in the insert of fig.2b .    from the scattering matrix , it is evident that the crossed andreev reflection amplitude is @xmath159 .",
    "therefore , the crossed andreev reflection is zero if the two majorana fermions are not coupled when @xmath160 . as shown above , when @xmath153 , the local andreev reflection is strongly suppressed to the order of @xmath161 .",
    "however , in this regime , the crossed andreev reflection is of order @xmath162 .",

    "it is interesting to note that the elastic co - tunnelling amplitudes from the left lead to the right lead equal the crossed andreev reflection amplitude .",
    "however , since the left lead and the right lead have equal chemical potential and electrons can also tunnel from the right lead to the left lead , there is no net current from the left lead to the right lead and vice versa .",

    "we first identify the topological regime by plotting the energy eigenstates of a superconducting wire .",

    "therefore , the fano factors and current - current correlations can still be used to probe the topological regime even in the multi - subband cases .      * _ identifying the topological regime for short wires _ *  for a wire which is much longer than the superconducting coherence length , the topological regime can be easily identified by plotting the energy eigenvalues versus the chemical potential as done in fig.2a of the main text . the topological regime is the region where zero energy modes emerge . however , in the short wire geometry discussed in this work , the two majorana fermions from the two ends may couple and the ground state energy oscillates as a function of chemical potential . as a result",

    "however , due to the fact that the bulk energy gap has to be closed at the topological phase transition point , we can identify the gap closing points as the topological phase transition points . in fig.[ring ] , the energy eigenvalues of a wire with periodic boundary conditions are studied . the ring geometry studied here",
    "has the same parameters as the wire studied in fig.2a of the main text except that periodic boundary conditions in the x - direction are used for the tight - binding model of eq.1 . as the majorana",

    "moreover , the voltage bias has to be larger than the temperature scale @xmath179 such that the shot noise can dominate the thermal noise . fortunately",
    ", these conditions can be easily satisfied in the semi - conductor / superconductor heterostructure .",
    "as shown in fig.2 and fig.3 of the main text , the maximum coupling energy can be in the order of @xmath180 which is much larger than @xmath181 .",
    "assuming that @xmath182 as shown experimentally and @xmath183 , we have @xmath184 .    since the coupling strength of the two majorana end states has the form @xmath67 , the maximum @xmath165 decreases exponentially as a function of the distance between the majorana end states .",

    "nevertheless , the length of the wire should not be much shorter than the superconducting coherence length .",
    "otherwise , the current - current correlations between the two leads can be significant even in the absence of majorana fermions .",
    "for example , it is evident from fig.[length]b and fig.[length]d that @xmath193 in the topologically trivial regime of the shorter wire with @xmath189 is much larger than @xmath193 in the topologically trivial regime of the wire with @xmath188 .",

    "<S> recent observation of zero bias conductance peaks in semiconductor wire / superconductor heterostructures has generated great interest , and there is a hot debate on whether the observation is associated with majorana fermions ( mfs ) . here </S>",

    "<S> _ introduction _ *  the search for majorana fermions ( mfs ) in condensed matter systems has been an important topic in recent years as mfs are non - abelian particles [ ] and have potential applications in quantum computations [ ] . </S>",
    "<S> recent proposals suggest that mfs can appear as zero energy end states in superconducting wires constructed by inducing superconductivity on semiconductor wires with rashba spin - orbit coupling through proximity effect [ ] . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , several experimental groups [ ] recently reported the observation of zero bias conductance peaks ( zbcps ) in andreev reflection experiments by coupling a normal lead to the end of the aforementioned semiconductor / superconductor heterostructure . </S>",
    "<S> these zbcps were possibly due to the mf induced andreev reflections [ ] . </S>",
    "<S> however , the origin of these zbcps remains a subject of debate [ ] .        in this work , instead of studying mf induced local andreev reflections [ ] , we explore the non - local properties of mfs . </S>",
    "<S> we show that shot noise , which can be used to probe the fractional charges [ ] and their anyonic statistics [ ] in fractional quantum hall states , can also be used to probe mfs [ ] in superconducting wires . to be specific , an experimental setup depicted in fig.1a </S>",
    "<S> is studied , in which two normal leads are attached to the two ends of a semiconductor wire with rashba spin - orbit coupling , proximity induced @xmath0-wave superconductivity and a magnetic field parallel to the wire . in the topological regime , mfs </S>",
    "<S> emerge as end states of the superconducting wire .    in the following sections , we show that when mf end states from the two ends of the wire are strongly coupled , local andreev reflection processes ( as depicted in fig.1b ) can be suppressed and the mf end states induce crossed andreev reflections ( cars ) , in which an electron from one lead is reflected as a hole in a different lead ( as depicted in fig.1c ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , each normal lead tunnels one electron with charge @xmath1 into the superconductor in each tunnelling event instead of @xmath2 as in local andreev reflection processes . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the fano factor of a normal lead , which is the ratio of the shot noise to the average current of the lead , is reduced from @xmath2 to @xmath1 in the car regime . moreover , the current of the two spatially separated normal leads are perfectly correlated in the car regime since the two electrons from the two leads have to form a cooper pair in order to tunnel into the fully gapped superconductor .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been pointed out that several effects such as disorder induced andreev bounded states [ ] , kondo effect [ ] , weak anti - localization [ ] and reflectionless tunnelling [ ] , may cause zero bias conductance in tunnelling experiments </S>",
    "<S> . however , all these effects are essentially the enhancement of local andreev reflections due to various mechanisms at the interface between a normal lead and a superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> these effects can not cause perfect current - current correlations between two spatially separated leads . </S>",

    "<S> the ground state wavefunction in the topological regime at @xmath126 is shown in fig.4e . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that this fermionic end state , which can mediate cars , is a non - local fermionic state and its wavefunction has significant distribution at both ends of the wire . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the experimental signatures of @xmath127 and @xmath128 at @xmath125 can be used to distinguish mfs from local fermions .    * </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion _ *  we show that the mf induced cars change the shot noise and strongly enhance the cross current - current correlations between two leads . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements of the fano factor @xmath1 of the leads and the strong current - current correlation at small voltage bias can be used to detect mfs . </S>",
