    "although the existence of dm is reliably established , the nature of the dm particles is still unknown .",
    "there are several well motivated dm models , which allow the direct and indirect experimental verification in the near future .",
    "the most bright indirect signature is the particles annihilation , and this process could be boosted inside the dense dm clumps .    in the standard scenario",
    "the dm clumps are formed from the cmb - normalized power - law spectrum of perturbations . the clumps",
    "participate in the hierarchical clustering , and finally have near power - law mass spectrum , obtained both in the numerical simulations @xcite and analytically @xcite . in the case of neutralino dm",
    "the minimum mass of the clumps is @xmath0 ( see e.  g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these lightest clumps are formed at the red - shift @xmath1 .",
    "the situation could be very different for other dm particle candidates , e.  g. in the case of the superheavy dm particles @xcite , and/or for the non - standard spectrum of perturbations .",
    "dm clumps can be formed very early in the beginning of the matter - dominated or even at the rd - stage from the large density perturbations of different nature : peaks in the spectrum of perturbations generated during inflation or at phase transitions in the early universe , or with the pbhs or cosmic string loops as the seeds . in this paper",
    "we consider in some details the two somehow related types of dm clumps : sdmc and ucmh .    in @xcite the formation of sdmcs at the rd - stage evolution of the universe from the entropy perturbations ( disturbances of matter content with constant curvature )",
    "was considered .",
    "the @xcite generalized this formalism for the adiabatic perturbations , and it was found that the pbhs and sdmcs can be connected due to their common origin from the same spectrum of density perturbations .",
    "sdmc forms if the perturbation is not sufficient for formation of pbh .",
    "such sdmcs can be figuratively called as `` failed black holes '' , because in the case of higher perturbation the pbh would be formed instead of sdmc .",
    "a similar idea was discussed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and in more detail  in @xcite .",
    "it is important that the observational cosmic gamma - rays constraints can limit the dm annihilation and the spectrum of initial perturbations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , to establish reliably such restrictions , it is necessary to determine the structure of sdmc , especially in its central region .",
    "later , at the matter - dominated stage , the dm concentrates around the sdmcs in the process of secondary accretion @xcite forming the halo with density profile @xmath2 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the similar halos can grow around pbhs @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite .",
    "the dm clumps , formed on the dust - like stage , probably have the density profiles of the gurevich - zybin type @xmath3 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , if these objects are isolated .",
    "gurevich - zybin theory explains the formation of singular density profile from the initially smooth perturbation .",
    "the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile is applicable , if the objects were not isolated during their formation but experienced hierarchical clustering .",
    "such a transition from nfw to a steeper inner profile near the minimum mass scale ( objects at this scale are formed almost as isolated ) was observed in the work @xcite .",
    "gurevich - zybin profile should give smaller annihilation signal compared with the calculations @xcite , where the @xmath4 profile was used .",
    "the simulations of @xcite indicate in favor of the @xmath4 fillmore & goldreich / bertschinger secondary infall profile even for isolated halos forming without a compact central object .",
    "therefore more work is needed to clarify this topic .    if the ucmh formed around a superdense sdmc , which virialised at the rd stage , the central density is determined by the sdmc s structure .",
    "first , the calculation of the average density of sdmc requires the formalism of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "second , the gurevich - zybin or steeper profile probably is formed in the sdmcs because of their isolation .",
    "third , the question about the radius of the central core has not yet definite solution . really , the central density of halos and subhalos is one of the unresolved problem in the observations and in the theory of the hierarchical dm structure formation .    using the conventional models of wimps annihilation , in the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite it was concluded from the absence of the observed annihilation signal , that the sdmcs can constitute only @xmath5 fraction of dm .",
    "a similar result was obtained in @xcite from the influence of the early annihilation on recombination and taking into account the known limitations to this effect from the cmb observations .",
    "the influence of ucmhs on the intergalactic medium and reionisation of the universe was studied in details by @xcite .",
    "the restrictions on the ucmhs in the decaying dark mater model were considered in @xcite .",
    "some restrictions were also obtained from the upper limits on the neutrino signals from annihilation @xcite .",
    "the lack of the observed gamma - ray point sources demonstrates that in the epoch of @xmath6 annihilation the value of perturbations at the horizon crossing was less than @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the sdmc , if they exists , were not destroyed in the tidal interactions during the formation of structures at large scales .",
    "one may propose the non - sphericity of the density perturbations as the effects that could suppress the formation and diminish the amount of the sdmc . in this paper",
    "we will show that non - sphericity plays the important role , and the sdmc number can be suppressed by several orders of magnitudde . in the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite the maximum density in the center of the ucmh is found from the effect of the particles annihilation .",
    "it was assumed that since the formation moment of ucmh the more and more particles have time to annihilate , the region of the annihilation expands , and therefore the radius of the core increases .",
    "this approach goes back to @xcite . in the opposite approach @xcite , @xcite , proposed earlier , it was taken into account that in addition to the annihilation the continuous stream of particles into the center of the ucmh exists , so that the core radius does not change significantly over time .",
    "in addition to the annihilation there are other restrictions on the central density and radius of the core . in @xcite",
    "the core radius @xmath8 was estimated by considering the transverse velocities which resulted in @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the virial radius .",
    "restrictions on the phase space density come from the liouville theorem , from the tidal forces @xcite , from the presence of substructures and the other sources of entropy generation @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the clumps have the core radius with @xmath11 fraction of @xmath10 as it follows from the numerical simulations of @xcite ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the important question is the final mass of the growing ucmh . in the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "@xcite it was assumed that the ceasing of the mass growth during the secondary accretion occurred at @xmath12 , when the large - scale structure began forming actively .",
    "previously , a rigorous criterion for the end of the growth was found in the papers @xcite , @xcite and it also will be discussed in this paper .",
    "for the clumps to be formed at the rd - stage of the universe evolution , the spectrum of perturbations must have an excess at small scale . the ordinary cmb - normalised power - low spectrum with the observed power index @xmath13 provides too small perturbations at the rd - stage for the clumps formation there . really , the spectrum of the curvature perturbations in this case is @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15  mpc@xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the typical amplitude of the perturbations @xmath19 is insufficient for the clumps formation at the rd - stage .    for the further examples we consider the peak - like excess at some scale superimposed on the ordinary power low spectrum ( [ prspectrum ] ) of adiabatic perturbations . in the case of the sufficiently high peak",
    ", the clumps can be formed even at the rd - stage .",
    "the constraints on the possible parameters of the peak , its position at cdm mass scale @xmath20 and the peak s high @xmath21 , are imposed by the pbh overproduction limits .",
    "let us outline formalism of the sdmcs formation at the rd - stage , which was developed in @xcite for entropy perturbations and generalized for the curvature perturbations in @xcite .",
    "we will start from the linear stage of evolution of the density perturbations .",
    "we will use the following notation : @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the co - moving wave vector of the perturbation , which could be expressed through dm mass @xmath20 of the sdmc and @xmath24 is the conformal time with @xmath25 .",
    "the adiabatic dm perturbation at @xmath26 follows the law @xcite @xmath27,\\label{dgame}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the initial gravitational potential in the conformal newtonian frame , which is related to the perturbation of curvature and to the perturbation of the radiation density at the horizon crossing as @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the euler constant .",
    "the ( [ dgame ] ) serves as the initial condition for the evolution of dm density perturbation at the linear stage , then @xmath31 , according to the equation @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 , and the prime denotes the derivative over @xmath34 .",
    "this linear stage gives the initial conditions for the further nonlinear evolution .",
    "suppose that there is a positive density perturbation @xmath35 .",
    "the origin of coordinates @xmath36 is chosen near the center of mass of the protohalo . in the first approximation the perturbation can be regarded as the spherically symmetric object .",
    "denote by @xmath20 the dm mass within some spherical layer .",
    "the contribution of the pressure of the homogeneous relativistic component into the energy - momentum tensor can be taken into account by replacing @xmath37",
    ". then , the evolution of a spherical layer at the sub - horizon scales @xmath38 obeys the equation @xmath39 it is taken into account the possibility of a bare mass @xmath40 , such as the mass of the black hole at the center of the layer .",
    "one may use the following parametrization : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the comoving coordinate .",
    "then @xmath43 obeys the equation @xcite @xmath44 the eq.([bigeq ] ) was solved in @xcite for isocurvature ( entropic ) perturbations . in this case the initial velocity @xmath45 , and the perturbation grows due to the initial value of the perturbation @xmath46 .",
    "according to @xcite the central density of the clump is @xmath47 , although our calculations gives for the mean density the smaller value @xmath48 .",
    "for the adiabatic perturbations the nonzero initial quantity @xmath49 is specified according to the solution ( [ dgame ] ) . to link the eulerian and lagrangian approaches",
    ", we put @xmath50 at some initial @xmath51 . for @xmath52 and @xmath53",

    ", we obtain @xmath58 and @xmath51 from the equations ( [ dgame ] ) and ( [ xy ] ) .",
    "the particular example of the @xmath59 evolution is illustrated at fig  [ grex ] .     and",
    "the solid curve was obtained by the numerical solution of ( [ bigeq ] ) with the initial conditions according to ( [ dgame ] ) , matched at @xmath61 ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the dotted curve shows the extrapolation of the linear law ( [ dgame ] ) to the large times.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the expansion of sdmc stops when @xmath62 , which is equivalent to @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "let us use the index `` max '' for the quantities at the the moment of the stop , then the density and radius of the sdmc at this time are @xmath64 after virialization the final radius @xmath65 and therefore @xmath66 .",
    "virialization is the dm mixing inside the forming halo till the equilibrium state .",
    "it works due to the presence of radial osculations , large irregularities and non - spherical movements . in the terminology of lynden - bell @xcite",
    ", these processes are called `` violent relaxation '' . the hierarchical clustering and associated relaxation",
    "also produce the universal density profiles , such as navarro - frenk - white profile @xcite .",
    "the new feature of the vitialization at the rd - stage is the disintegration of the very irregular protohalo . indeed ,",
    "if the protohalo is sufficiently elongated then the mass of the radiation inside the enveloping sphere will exceed the mass of dm , and the self - gravitation of the object will not hold the protohalo s parts together . the protohalo will decay and the parts of it will fly away one after another . to obtain the boundary of this regime of evolution , leading to the decay , the numerical simulations of sdmc at the rd - stage are desirable .",

    "the mass of dm in some spherical volume is connected to the mass of the radiation at the moment of the horizon crossings as @xcite @xmath74 therefore the pbhs restrict the sdmcs from the different mass region .",
    "the pbhs are formed in the tail of the gaussian perturbations distribution , but sdmc are formed from perturbations of the rms order . the pbhs and sdmc are connected not individually but through their common spectrum of perturbation . as it s clear from the fig  [ grpbh ] , the pbh restriction are very sensitive to the threshold @xmath75 of the pbh formation . according to different calculations this threshold is @xmath76 , where @xmath72 corresponds to the simple analytic arguments of b.j .",

    "there is only small room for the sdmcs in the case @xmath72 .",
    "the small - scale clumps from high peaks form earlier in comparison with the larger objects .",
    "therefore the small clumps are not destructed in the hierarchical clustering .    for illustration",
    "we consider the three particular examples , which are presented in the table  [ tab ] :    \\1 . the clumps with minimum mass @xmath77 in the case of the standard spectrum of perturbation , normalized on the 7-year wmap data ( power index of the primordial spectrum @xmath78 ) .",

    "let us discuss several possible restrictions on the maximum density in the clumps centres ( core radius ) .",
    "the liouville s theorem is known in the two equivalent formulations : the phase volume @xmath206 is conserved or the distribution function in the phase space @xmath207 .",
    "therefore the probability density at the core ( mean value of @xmath208 over core volume ) can not exceed initial value due to liouville s theorem .",
    "the only necessary condition for the theorem validity is the hamiltonian character of the system .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath8 can only be restricted , but not determined with the help of the liouville s theorem applied only to the initial and final stages of clump evolution .",
    "this is because the entropy production in the intermediate processes @xcite . by other words ,",
    "the phase volume becomes dispersed during the evolution ( see fig .",
    "8.3 in @xcite ) .",
    "the distribution function can be estimated simply as @xmath209 , where @xmath210 is the core density and @xmath211 is the characteristic velocity in the core . for the near isothermal density profile @xmath212",
    "the @xmath211 is of the order of the virial velocity of the whole clump .",
    "we restrict the @xmath8 from the liouville s theorem applied to the initial and final stages .",
    "there are two sources of initial entropy or initial @xmath102 : thermal velocities of dm particles at decoupling and peculiar velocities in the case of adiabatic density perturbations .",
    "the thermal part can be attributed to the distribution function at the time of kinetic decoupling @xmath213 @xcite ( section 8.3.2 ) .",
    "the neutralino is nonrelativistic nondegenerate at @xmath213 , therefore the good approximation for the distribution function at this moment is the maxwell s distribution : @xmath214 where @xmath215 is the density of dm , which is expressed through the temperature at any time by the using of the entropy conservation condition @xmath216 , where @xmath217 is the effective number of degrees of freedom at the temperature @xmath218 , and @xmath219 is the mass of dm particle .",
    "the distribution function inside the core is less then the initial distribution function , which has the maximum value at @xmath220 .",
    "therefore we use the inequality @xmath221 . for the isothermal density profile in the clump",
    "this condition gives the restriction on the relative core radius @xmath222 the numerical examples for the case of @xmath223  gev neutralinos with the temperature of the kinetic decoupling @xmath224  mev are shown in the table  [ tab ] .",
    "now we turn to the peculiar velocities , which are generated due to the gravitational instability and can play the role analogous to the thermal velocities in the liouville theorem restriction .",
    "normally , the cut - off of the spectrum is not sharp . even for the usual exponential cut off , e.g.",
    ", the @xmath225 modes are present with sufficiently large amplitudes , where @xmath23 is the cut - off scale .",
    "the @xmath225 modes give the peculiar velocities which are distributed near isotropicaly , compared with the approximately radial @xmath23 modes .",
    "therefore , the modes @xmath226 can be considered as approximately randomly directed in analogy with the thermal velocities in the liouville theorem .",
    "the peculiar velocity at some mass scale in the case of the flat metrics can be expressed as @xcite @xmath227 the growing mode comprises only @xmath228 fraction of ( [ vnabla ] ) .",
    "just after the @xmath194 the falling mode ceased , the peculiar velocities developed and grow later as @xmath229 .",
    "we take the initial stage at @xmath230 .",
    "the calculations are analogous to the thermal case with the replacement of the thermal velocity by the peculiar one .",
    "we obtain the minimum relative core radius in the form @xmath231 the numerical results of the calculations ( [ rcliwtherm ] ) and ( [ rcpec ] ) are shown in the table  [ tab ] . at the rd - stage the peculiar velocities are estimated according to the formalism presented in the section  [ formsec ] .      in the work @xcite the maximum density in the center of the clump was estimated from the annihilation rate and the elapsed time : @xmath232 where @xmath233 is the current moment of time and @xmath234 is the formation moment of the clump .",
    "according to this estimate the core region becomes larger due to the loss of the particles at the orbits , that goes through the center of the clump .",
    "for the isothermal @xmath212 density profile , the corresponding relative core radius @xmath235 is presented in the table  [ tab ] for the thermal production value @xmath236  @xmath237  s@xmath16 and @xmath223  gev .",
    "this approach assumes that the orbits passing through the center are not fulfilled after the particles annihilation .",
    "the opposite case with the compensation of the particles loss was considered in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it is found that the core radius is defined by the annihilation at the stage of the halo formation .",
    "the minimum radius was found from the condition that the annihilation time is of the order of the jeans time , because this time defines the characteristic time of the density profile formation .",
    "this corresponds to the epoch of the halo formation . in the article @xcite the core radius of the already formed clump",
    "was found in the assumption of the steady hydrodynamic bulk flow of the dm to the clump center .",
    "it was putted that the free fall time is equal to the annihilation time , and the center of the clumps is always fulfilled by the dm particles from the flow .    in the real clump",
    "there are mechanisms of the regeneration of the orbits with the small angular momentums , which goes through the center of the clump .",
    "these conditions result in the larger central density in comparison with ( [ annwr ] ) .",
    "these orbits exist in some degree due to the clump s dynamical restructuring .",
    "even the tidal forces from nearby stars and gravitational shocks at the galactic disk crossings lead to the changes of the clumps dynamical structure and appearance of the orbits with small angular momentum .",
    "the exact problem treatment requires the solution of the self - consistent kinetic equations for the clump structure with the influence of the external tidal forces .      in the above subsections",
    "the lower limits on the relative core radius were presented .",
    "it s clear from the table  [ tab ] , that the liouville restriction with the peculiar velocities can be the dominant effect in the formation of the core in the very dense clumps , formed just after the matter - radiation equality .",
    "can other effects produce the core with the greater sizes ?",
    "dwarf and lsb galaxies tell us that some unknown effect is responsible for their large cores , which was not reproduced yet in the n - body simulations .",
    "first of all , the phase - space density is diluted by the entropy generation during the nonlinear hierarchical clustering @xcite . in the work @xcite this effect",
    "was explored for the galaxies - sized halos , and @xcite concluded that at the small scales the entropy generation is less effective , but the quantitative value is unclear .",
    "another affect is the tidal forces , which deflect particles , defocus them from the center of the clump at the stage of it s formation @xcite",
