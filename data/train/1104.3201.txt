    "since the polarization anisotropy is generated only at the last scattering surface , the negative trough in the @xmath74 spectrum at @xmath75 ( that corresponds to a scale larger than the horizon at the epoch of last scattering ) measured by wmap first sealed this loophole , and provides an unambiguous proof of apparently ` acausal ' correlations in the cosmological perturbations  @xcite .",

    "<S> the ability to quantify the universe has largely improved due to observational constraints coming from structure formation measurements of cmb anisotropy and , more recently , polarization have played a very important role . besides precise determination of various parameters of the ` standard ' cosmological model , observations have also established some important basic tenets that underlie models of cosmology and structure formation in the universe  ` acausally ' correlated initial perturbations in a flat , statistically isotropic universe , adiabatic nature of primordial density perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> these are consistent with the expectation of the paradigm of inflation and the generic prediction of the simplest realization of inflationary scenario in the early universe . </S>",
    "<S> further , gravitational instability is the established mechanism for structure formation from these initial perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> the signature of primordial perturbations observed as the cmb anisotropy and polarization is the most compelling evidence for new , possibly fundamental , physics in the early universe . </S>",
    "<S> the community is now looking beyond the estimation of parameters of a working ` standard ' model of cosmology for subtle , characteristic signatures from early universe physics . </S>"
