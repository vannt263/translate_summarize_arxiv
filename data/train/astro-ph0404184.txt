    "in the framework of the hierarchical model for the formation of cosmic structures , galaxy clusters are supposed to form by accretion of smaller units ( galaxies , groups etc ) .",
    "after the epoch of mass aggregation ( which depend on the cosmological model ) , violent relaxation processes will tend to alter the cluster phase - space configuration producing ` regular ' , quasi - spherical , having smooth density profile clusters . in the last decade due to the increased spatial resolution in x - ray imaging ( rosat , xmm-_newton _ , chandra ) and to the availability of wide - field cameras , many of the previously thought `` regular '' clusters have shown to be clumpy to some level , a fact that could have important consequences for structure formation theories , since the present fraction of dynamically young clusters , as well as the rate of cluster evolution ( as measured for example by their luminosity and temperature functions and their morphology ) , are cosmology dependent ( eg . , richstone , loeb & turner 1992 , evrard et al .",

    "detailed optical and x - ray studies have yielded evidence for significant amounts of subclustering within local and distant clusters ( eg .",

    "hints do exist for a very recent ( within the last gyr ) dynamical evolution of the cluster population ( melott et al .",
    "2001 ; plionis 2002 , see however floor et al . 2003 ) .",
    "note however that the existence of substructure does not necessarily mean that the corresponding cluster is dynamically young due to the ambiguity of cluster post - merging relaxation times ( see discussion in plionis 2001 ) .",
    "furthermore , the dynamical evolution of member galaxies and of the icm gas is also an open issue .",
    "star formation seems to be active in clusters showing substantial substructure and velocity gradients , as expected if a recent merger has taken place .",
    "for example , the fraction of blue galaxies is strongly correlated with cluster ellipticity ( wang & ulmer 1997 ) , while ellipticity is strongly correlated with the dynamical state of the cluster ( eg .",
    "kolokotronis et al . 2001 ) .",
    "it appears that the violent merging events trigger star - formation , possibly through a multitude of different mechanisms ; for example , the excess number of galaxy - galaxy interactions , the rapid variation of the cluster gravitational field ( bekki 1999 ) , etc . an interesting observable that may be related to the dynamics of clusters is their tendency to be aligned with their nearest neighbor as well as with other clusters that reside in the same supercluster ( eg .",

    "the significance , @xmath5 , of such centroid variations to the presence of background contamination , random density fluctuations and small galaxy number effects can be estimated using monte carlo cluster simulations in which , by construction , there is no substructure ( see plionis 2001 ) .",

    "plionis & basilakos ( 2002 ) , using a sample of @xmath11 apm clusters , correlated the alignment signal between cluster neighbors , @xmath12 , with the existence of cluster substructure , as measured by the deviation from the expected density fluctuations in units of @xmath5 ( eg .",

    "we plot the correlation length , @xmath15 , as a function of cluster substructure significance level , which is clearly an increasing function of @xmath5 .",
    "the conclusion of this analysis is that clusters showing evidence of dynamical activity reside in high - density environments .",
    "our results are in agreement with a similar environmental dependence found in the reflex and bcs x - ray cluster sample ( schecker et al . , 2001 ) and for cooling flow clusters with high mass accretion rates ( loken , melott & miller 1999 ) .     between the galaxy and cluster orientations within superclusters for the @xmath16 km / sec clusters ( black lines ) and for those with @xmath17 km / sec ( red hatched histogram ) .",

    "a further interesting question regarding environmental effects on large scales is whether clusters are also aligned with the orientation of their parent supercluster .",
    "we define apm superclusters by using a friends of friends algorithm and estimate for each supercluster the misalignment angle , @xmath18 , between its projected orientation and the mean position angle of its member clusters . in figure 2",
    "we present the frequency distribution of @xmath18 for two different supercluster catalogues ( based on linking radii of 20 and 30 @xmath3 mpc , respectively ) .",
    "the significant excess of small @xmath18 s is evidence that indeed clusters do show preferential alignments with the orientation of their parent superclusters . as an example , in the right panel of fig.2 we present the projected distribution of clusters in a dense and filamentary apm supercluster .",
    "embedded in the plot are the smoothed galaxy density distributions of a few member clusters .",

    "( 2003 ) found significant alignments between the projected major axis of the 10 brightest galaxies ( excluding the bcg ) and their parent cluster position angle , mostly in high - density environments .",
    "this alignment signal is stronger for higher velocity dispersion clusters , which in our case ( based on a variety of criteria ) appear also to be dynamically young merging clusters ( see left panel of fig.3 ) .",
    "this points strongly in the direction of galaxy alignments being correlated with their parent cluster dynamical youth and local density ( see also west & blakeslee 2000 ; knebe et al .",
    "we have also studied in detail , using very deep wfi images , the highly unrelaxed abell cluster ( a521 at @xmath20 ) and find that such alignments ( see right panel of fig.3 ) are present also in fainter red - sequence galaxies as well as in the orientation of groups of galaxies in the extended environment around the cluster ( see also kitzbichler & saurer 2003 ) .    , and",

    "plionis , basilakos & tovmassian ( 2004 ) and plionis & basilakos ( 2004 ) analysed two large samples of groups ( the uzc - ssrs2 and the 2dfgrs-2pigg samples ) within a roughly volume limited region ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 km / sec for the two samples respectively ) . in figure 4",
    "we present the projected , on the plane of the sky , axial ratio distribution for three group richness classes , while in figure 5 we show the corresponding inverted axial ratio distribution assuming that groups are intrinsically either prolate or oblate spheroids .",
    "there is an obvious group richness - flatness relation , seen in both projected and intrinsic axial ratio distributions , with group flatness decreasing with richness .",
    "we also find a weak ( spearman correlation coefficient @xmath23 ) but significant correlation ( @xmath24 ) , between the velocity dispersion of groups and their flattening , with flatter systems having lower velocity dispersions .",
    "such a correlation as well as the increase of the group sphericity with richness , which extends also to clusters , could be explained as an indication of a higher degree of virialization , which is expected to be more rapid in more massive systems .",
    "furthermore , we find that groups of galaxies are prolate - like systems which is agreement with the shape of clusters and superclusters of galaxies ( eg .",
    "cooray 2000 ; basilakos , plionis & maddox 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "this is the expected shape for cosmic structures that form in quasi one - dimensional large - scale structures ( filaments ) .",
    "other interesting environmental effects that have been found is the decrease of the group velocity dispersion as their distance from nearby clusters decreases ( eg .",
    "ragone et al 2004 ) .",
    "we have presented evidence , based on the apm and abell cluster samples as well as the uzc - sssrs2 and 2dfgrs group samples , that there is a strong link between the dynamical state of clusters / groups of galaxies and their large - scale environment .",
    "dynamically young clusters are significantly more aligned with their nearest neighbors and they are also much more spatially clustered .",
    "clusters belonging in dense superclusters are preferentially aligned with their parent supercluster projected orientation and bright galaxies , in dynamically young clusters , are also orientated along their parent cluster major axis .",
    "these coherent orientation effects , from the scale of galaxies to that of superclusters support the hierarchical formation scenario in which clusters form by anisotropic merging along the large - scale filamentary structures within which they are embedded .",
