    "the all - sky mid - infrared ( ir ) images obtained by the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( _ wise _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have enabled the discovery of a large number of brown dwarfs in the solar neighborhood , particularly at very low temperatures @xcite .",
    "the closest of these newly found brown dwarfs are wise j104915.57@xmath0531906.1 a and b ( hereafter wise 1049@xmath05319 a and b , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and wise j085510.83@xmath0071442.5 ( hereafter wise 0855@xmath00714 , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , which are the third and fourth closest known systems to the sun , respectively ( 2.0 and 2.3  pc ) .",
    "wise 1049@xmath05319 a and b have spectral types of l8 and t0.5 @xcite and wise 0855@xmath00714 likely has a spectral type of y @xcite , making them the closest known members of their respective spectral classes . due to their proximity , these systems are ideal targets for a direct imaging search for substellar companions at very low luminosities and temperatures . to search for companions to these brown dwarfs at wide separations ( @xmath11 , @xmath12  au ) , the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite is the best available telescope because it offers the greatest sensitivity in the mid - ir bands where cold substellar objects are brightest .",
    "for instance , _ spitzer _ is capable of detecting a 1  @xmath5 object with an age of 1  gyr at the distances of wise 1049@xmath05319 and wise 0855@xmath00714 @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , near - ir adaptive optics ( ao ) images can be used to search for companions to wise 1049@xmath05319 a and b down to @xmath13 , or 0.2 au .",
    "wise 0855@xmath00714 has been observed with ao in the @xmath14 band by @xcite , but it was not detected . in this paper , we present multi - epoch imaging from _ spitzer _ for wise 1049@xmath05319 and wise 0855@xmath00714 and ao imaging from vlt for wise 1049@xmath05319 .",
    "near - ir ao images were used to search for companions to wise 1049@xmath05319 a and b at small separations .",
    "these observations were performed on the unit telescope 4 of the very large telescope ( vlt ) with the nasmyth adaptive optics system ( naos ) and the high - resolution near - ir camera ( conica ) , which together are known as naco @xcite .",
    "naco was operated with the s27 camera , the n90c10 dichroic , and the @xmath14 filter .",
    "the s27 camera contains a 1024@xmath151024 array and has a plate scale of @xmath16  pixel@xmath17 , corresponding to a field of view of @xmath18 .",
    "we selected individual exposure times of 4 and 120  sec .",
    "the former provided unsaturated data for the binary components that could reveal companions at small separations , and the latter provided greater sensitivity to companions at large separations .",
    "we obtained 10 dithered short exposures and 17 dithered long exposures on the night of 2013 april 13 . in these data , the point spread functions ( psfs ) of the binary components",
    "exhibited slight elongations in the direction of the axis connecting the pair , which was likely caused by the fact that both objects were present in the wavefront sensor sub - pupils . because of these elongations , the observatory repeated the observations on the night of 2013 may 13 , which produced similar results as on the first night .",
    "after performing dark subtraction and flat fielding , we registered and combined the images at a given exposure time from a given night . the final combined images from each of the two nights exhibit similar sensitivity and fwhm ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the combined image from the second night for the 120  sec exposures is shown in figure  [ fig : ao ] . in the long exposures ,",
    "saturation occurs within the cores of the psfs of the binary components ( @xmath20 ) .      to search for co - moving companions in wide orbits",
    ", we obtained multi - epoch images of fields surrounding wise 1049@xmath05319 and wise 0855@xmath00714 with the infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on board the _ spitzer space telescope_. irac has a plate scale of @xmath21 and a field of view of @xmath22 .",
    "two filters were available with irac , which were centered at 3.6 and 4.5  ( denoted as [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] ) . because the latter provides better sensitivity to cold brown dwarfs , only the maps in that band were centered on the targets .",
    "we did collect images at 3.6  in flanking fields during the 4.5  observations .",
    "wise 1049@xmath05319 was observed on 2013 may 3 and 2013 september 29 through astronomical observation requests ( aors ) 48641024 and 48640512 , respectively .",
    "wise 0855@xmath00714 was observed on 2014 july 1 and 2015 january 29 through aors 51040000 and 51040256 , respectively .",
    "for each epoch and band for wise 1049@xmath05319 , we obtained one short exposure and one long exposure at each of three dither positions near each of 18 locations in a @xmath23 grid of pointings separated by 150 and 260@xmath2 , respectively . for wise 0855@xmath00714",
    ", nine dithered long exposures were collected near each of nine positions in a @xmath24 grid of pointings separated by 260@xmath2 in each direction . for both targets ,",
    "the long exposure times were 23.6 and 26.8  sec at 3.6 and 4.5  , respectively .",
    "a short exposure time of 0.8  sec was used for wise 1049@xmath05319 . the short exposures were included to provide images in which wise 1049@xmath05319  a and b were not saturated .",
    "these data were reduced in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "a combination of the reduced long exposures in both bands and epochs is shown in figures  [ fig : im1049 ] and [ fig : im0855 ] for wise 1049@xmath05319 and wise 0855@xmath00714 , respectively .",
    "for each system , a field within 420@xmath2 was fully covered by both epochs at 4.5  , corresponding to 840 and 970  au , respectively , given their distances @xcite .",
    "the components of wise 1049@xmath05319 had a separation of @xmath25 in 2013 @xcite and are only partially resolved in these data .",
    "because wise 1049@xmath05319  a and b have similar colors and magnitudes and appear near the same position in naco s field of view , we can use the psf of one component for psf subtraction of the other .",
    "the psf - subtracted versions of the short and long exposures do not show any additional components at close separations .",
    "outside of the psfs of the components , several objects are detected , as shown in figures  [ fig : im1049 ] and [ fig : im0855 ] .",
    "none of these sources exhibit a motion between the two epochs that is consistent with the motion of the binary .",
    "most of these stars are also detected in @xmath26-band images from @xcite , and a comparison of those images with the naco data further indicates that they are not co - moving companions .",
    "wise 1049@xmath05319 moved @xmath27 between the @xmath26 observations and the second epoch with naco , but all of the sources detected in both images remained stationary to within @xmath19 . to estimate the detection limit for companions in the naco data , we measured the standard deviations within annuli across a range of radii from each component .",
    "the width of each annulus was four pixels , which is similar to the fwhm of the psf .",
    "because the psfs of the components overlap , we ignored the data in the half of each annulus in the direction of the other component .",
    "in other words , the standard deviations were computed for the portions of the annuli from position angles of 45225@xmath28 for a and 045 and 225 - 360@xmath28 for b. the standard deviations as a function of separation are similar for the two stars , which is expected since they have similar @xmath14-band magnitudes .",
    "we have computed the average of the two curves of standard deviation versus separation . in the top panel of figure  [ fig : limits ] , we show that average curve in terms of the 5  @xmath29 magnitude contrast relative to the unresolved @xmath14-band magnitude for the binary system from the point source catalog of the two micron all - sky survey @xcite .    to search the irac images of wise 1049@xmath05319 and wise 0855@xmath00714 for companions , we began by measuring the positions for all point sources in each band and epoch with the task _ starfind _ within iraf .",
    "the resulting positions were transformed to equatorial coordinates using the world coordinate systems in the image headers .",
    "we identified the closest matches between the two epochs for each combination of bands , namely 3.6a/3.6b , 3.6a/4.5b , 4.5a/3.6b , and 4.5a/4.5b where ",
    "a \" and  b \" refer to the two epochs ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : im1049 ] and [ fig : im0855 ] ) .",
    "the differences in coordinates for these matches are shown in figure  [ fig : pm ] .",
    "the motions of wise 1049@xmath05319 and wise 0855@xmath00714 are large enough that the same motions for co - moving companions should be easily detected for the faintest sources in the images , but no such objects are present in figure  [ fig : pm ] . as with the ao data",
    ", we estimated the detection limit at 4.5  as a function of separation from wise 1049@xmath05319  a and b based on the standard deviations within annuli over a range of radii , where the annuli were given widths of @xmath30 .",
    "the resulting values of 5  @xmath29 are plotted relative to the combined 4.5  magnitude of wise 1049@xmath05319  a and b in the top panel of figure  [ fig : limits ] . because wise 0855@xmath00714 is much fainter than wise 1049@xmath05319",
    ", the sky background dominates the psf down to rather small separations of @xmath31 . as a result",
    ", the detection limit does not vary beyond @xmath32 for wise 0855@xmath00714 , and hence it is not plotted as a function of separation in figure  [ fig : limits ]",
    ". within @xmath32 from wise 0855@xmath00714 , the detection limit in terms of @xmath33[4.5 ] is similar to that of wise 1049@xmath05319 . at separations that are sufficiently large for the sky to dominate",
    ", 5  @xmath29 occurs at @xmath34=18.1 $ ] and 18.7 for wise 1049@xmath05319 and wise 0855@xmath00714 , respectively , which correspond to @xmath35 and 21.9 .",
    "we can use evolutionary and atmospheric models of brown dwarfs to convert the detection limits in @xmath14 and [ 4.5 ] to limits in mass . because the ages of wise 1049@xmath05319 and wise 0855@xmath00714 are unknown , we perform this conversion with the fluxes predicted for ages of 1 and 10  gyr , which encompass the ages of most stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "we rely primarily on the fluxes from the models by @xcite and @xcite that are cloudless and employ equilibrium chemistry .",
    "other models that include clouds and non - equilibrium chemistry produce roughly similar fluxes in @xmath14 and [ 4.5 ] ( @xmath36 ) for the ranges of absolute magnitudes probed by our images @xcite , and hence the derived mass limits do not depend significantly on the choice of models .",
    "the coldest brown dwarfs modeled by @xcite and @xcite ( @xmath37  k ) have @xmath38 , whereas the irac images approach @xmath39 at the distances of our targets . to transform our limits at @xmath40 to masses",
    ", we have adopted the absolute magnitudes from the models by @xcite for 1  gyr , which extend down to @xmath41 ( for 1  @xmath5 ) .",
    "those authors did not perform calculations for the other age of 10  gyr that we consider . after combining the fluxes from the above sets of models with our measured limits in @xmath14 and [ 4.5 ] for wise 1049@xmath05319",
    ", we arrive at the mass limits that are shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : limits ] .",
    "the naco image provides greater sensitivity at smaller separations ( e.g. , 25 and 65  @xmath5 at 0.4  au for 1 and 10  gyr , respectively ) .",
    "the mass limits for the naco and irac images intersect at @xmath42 ( @xmath437  au ) . at that separation ,",
    "both images have limits near 7 and 20  @xmath5 for 1 and 10  gyr , respectively . because none of the brown dwarf models that we have considered are as faint as the @xmath44 limits reached at large separations , we are not able to estimate precise values for the lowest masses that are detectable in the irac images .",
    "however , an extrapolation of the mass limits in figure  [ fig : limits ] suggests that the irac images are able to detect companions at large separations from wise 1049@xmath05319 ( and wise 0855@xmath00714 ) that are slightly below 1  @xmath5 for 1  gyr and @xmath45  @xmath5 for 10  gyr .",
    "such objects would have temperatures of @xmath43150  k according to the models .",
    "because wise 1049@xmath05319 and wise 0855@xmath00714 are nearby and intrinsically faint , direct imaging of these systems is sensitive to companions at low luminosities and small orbital distances .",
    "however , no companions have been detected in our naco and irac data , which is not surprising given the low binary fractions exhibited by l and t dwarfs ( @xmath4320% , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* references therein ) .",
    "wise 1049@xmath05319 is a binary system ( l8+t0.5 ) , and triples composed entirely of cool dwarfs are especially rare in direct imaging surveys @xcite .",
    "most l and t dwarf binaries have small separations ( @xmath46  au , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the same is true for the small number of known binaries among late - t and y dwarfs @xcite . as a result , it is unlikely that either wise 1049@xmath05319 or wise 0855@xmath00714 has cool companions beyond the boundaries of our images .",
    "some brown dwarfs that are discovered in wide - field surveys and initially appear to be isolated objects are later found to be distant companions to stars @xcite , but our two targets do not have co - moving stellar companions based on the _ wise _ proper motion surveys by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "of course , wise 1049@xmath05319 and wise 0855@xmath00714 may have companions below our detection limits , especially at small separations .",
    "the components of wise 1049@xmath05319 are sufficiently bright for a search for close companions through radial velocity and astrometric measurements .",
    "near - ir imaging with the _ hubble space telescope _ is the only available option for improving the constraints on the presence of close companions to wise 0855@xmath00714 given that it is only barely detectable with ground - based telescopes @xcite .",
