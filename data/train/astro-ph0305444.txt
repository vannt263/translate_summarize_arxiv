    "the hubble deep field north ( hdf - n ) @xcite , a small region of the sky targeted by the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ , has stimulated the study of the high redshift universe ever since the data were released in 1995 .",
    "the original optical image of the hdf is one of the deepest ever obtained , and resolves thousands of galaxies in an area of a few square arcminutes .",
    "however , since optical images capture only a narrow part of the spectrum , and since the rest - frame wavelength range detected depends on the redshift , it is necessary to supplement the _ hst _  image with data at other wavelengths in order to obtain a more complete understanding of galaxy evolution . in the years since the hdf image became public , deep pointings using radio , x - ray , near - ir , and",
    "mid - ir telescopes have been conducted .",
    "additionally , optical spectroscopy has been carried out on hundreds of suitable objects in the field , thereby obtaining redshifts for most of the brighter _",
    "hst_-detected objects .",
    "the original hdf field is the size of a single wfpc2 field of view , roughly @xmath5 .",
    "_ hst _  also obtained shallower observations in fields adjacent to this , extending the region of study to roughly @xmath6 .",
    "these ` flanking fields ' have also been covered by other telescopes , and in fact over time the region associated with the hdf has been extended to about @xmath7 in most wave - bands . for an excellent review of the hdf - n region and its impact on the optical view of astronomy ,",
    "refer to the article by . despite these extensive observations , fully understanding the high redshift universe",
    "is hindered by the presence of dust , which re - processes radiation and emits it in the far - infrared ( fir ) .",
    "the importance of this is clearly demonstrated in the population of galaxies detected by the submillimetre common user bolometer array ( scuba ; holland et al .",
    "even with the tremendous observational effort of the past five years , we have made only modest progress with scuba detected galaxies beyond the conclusions drawn from the pioneering work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "scuba mapping surveys have constrained the number counts , and show that significant evolution is required in the local ultra - luminous infra - red galaxy ( ulirg ) population in order to explain the abundance of high redshift scuba sources .",
    "having detected these sources , the goal now is to characterise them and try to answer fundamental questions about their nature .",
    "what powers their extreme luminosities ?",
    "what is their redshift distribution ?",
    "what objects do they correspond to today ?",
    "one way to do this is by doing pointed photometry on a list of high redshift sources detected at other wavelengths , but this obviously introduces some biases .",
    "an alternate approach , one taken by many groups , is to do a ` blank field ' survey , and compare the sub - mm map against images taken with other telescopes at other wavelengths .",
    "arguably the best field to do this is in the hubble deep field region , which has more telescope time invested in observations than any other extragalactic deep field .",
    "in addition to the data already available , observations with the _ hst_-acs and upcoming confusion - limited _ sirtf _  observations , make this an appealing region to target with scuba .",
    "for all these reasons it is worthwhile to combine the available sub - mm data in this part of the sky .",
    "observations with scuba require the user to ` chop ' the secondary mirror at a rate of 7.8125 hz between the target position and a reference ( also called ` off ' ) position .",
    "the difference between the signals measured at each position removes common - mode atmospheric noise .",
    "the direction and size of the chop throw is adjustable , and is typically set such that the off position does not change over time due to sky rotation . a map made in such a way",
    "will then exhibit a negative copy of the source in the off position .    in raster - scan mode",
    ", the whole telescope moves on the sky in order to sample a region larger than the array size .",
    "a map made from data collected in this mode is commonly referred to as a ` scan - map ' .",
    "an alternative way to sample a large area is to piece together smaller ` jiggle ' maps . in this mode",
    ", the telescope stares toward the target and the secondary mirror steps around a dither pattern designed to fill in the space on the image plane between the conical feedhorns .",
    "photometry mode is very similar to jiggle - mapping , except the dither pattern is smaller in order to spend more time observing the target object .",
    "the trade off is that the image plane is not fully sampled , and there will be gaps in a map made from photometry data .",
    "jiggle - mapping and photometry also differ from scan mapping because they use two off positions in the chopping process .",
    "therefore there will be two negative echos of each source .",
    "our group has produced a shallow ` scan - map ' of the region at 450 and 850@xmath4m(borys et al .",
    "2002 , hereafter bo02 ) using scuba . given the high profile of the region however , groups from the uk and hawaii also targeted the hdf to exploit the rich multi - wavelength observations available .",
    "the @xmath8 area centred on the hdf itself , studied originally by hughes et al .",
    "( 1998 ; hereafter h98 ) , was recently re - analysed by serjeant at al .",
    "( 2002 ; hereafter s02 ) and we use their published data for comparison here .",
    "results from observations taken by the hawaii group can be found in barger et al .",
    "( 2000 ; hereafter ba00 ) .",
    "we have obtained all of these data from the jcmt archive or from the observers directly and embedded them in our scan - map .",
    "the extra data considerably increase the sensitivity of the final map in the overlap regions , but at the expense of much more inhomogeneous noise and a correspondingly more complicated data analysis .",
    "co - adding data taken in different observing modes has not previously been performed for extra - galactic sub - mm surveys , and so we discuss our procedure in some detail below .",
    "the full list of projects allocated time to study the hdf region is extensive . observing details for each project",
    "are given in table [ hdftab ] .",
    "almost all work carried out in the region has used the jiggle - map mode in deep , yet small surveys .",
    "three projects involved targeted photometry observations taken in ` 2-bolometer chopping ' mode . the surf user reduction facility ( surf ; jenness & lightfoot 1998 ) software was not able to process these particular files for inclusion in the map , but we shall discuss these observations later .",
    "project m00bc01 is a single jiggle - map observation taken in such a way that co - adding it to the map is also difficult , and shall be described later as well .",
    "all of the remaining data could be co - added into a ` super - map ' , as we now describe .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     a fit to a power law with these combined counts gives @xmath9 .",
    "this is not too dissimilar from the 850@xmath4 m  slope , though slightly shallower .",
    "this might be an interesting result : if the scuba sources are mainly at @xmath10 , then one would expect the 450@xmath4 m  fluxes to drop off more steeply than the 850@xmath4 m  counts because the k  correction becomes positive for 450@xmath4 m  at these redshifts . with only three estimates for the 450@xmath4mnumber counts however , it is premature to draw strong conclusions .",
    "nevertheless , this shows that constraints on the number counts at different wavelengths can serve as a probe of the evolution and redshift distribution of sub - mm galaxies .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the presence of clustering may also affect estimates for the source counts .",
    "@xcite report weak evidence of clustering in the @xmath11 arcminute map of h98 in the sense of statistical correlations with lbgs , which are themselves strongly clustered @xcite .",
    "the uk 8mjy survey @xcite which covers over 250 square arcminutes , and the smaller yet deeper cfrs 3- and 14-hour fields @xcite fail to detect clustering among the scuba detected sources .",
    "there appears ( by eye ) to be clustering in the super - map ; in particular the concentration of sources near the centre of the map , the trio of sources to the west of the map , and the group of 4 north of it might suggest a clustering scale on the order of 30 arcsec or so . however , one would _",
    "expect _ more sources in these areas because of the increased sensitivity .",
    "hence one needs to carry out a statistical clustering analysis , including the inhomogeneous noise , to quantify this .",
    "clustering is usually described as the probability , @xmath12 , of finding a source in a solid angle @xmath13 , and another object in another solid angle @xmath13 separated by an angle @xmath14 .",
    "this probability is described by : @xmath15\\omega^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the mean surface density of objects on the sky and @xmath17 is the angular two - point correlation function . if @xmath17 is zero , then the distribution of sources is completely random , while otherwise it describes the probability in excess of random .",
    "the correlation function @xmath17 is estimated by counting pairs and there are several specific estimators in the literature .",
    "the one we employ is that proposed by @xcite : @xmath18 this particular estimator has been shown to have no bias and also has a lower variance than the alternatives . in this equation",
    ", @xmath19 represents sources in the scuba catalogue , and @xmath20 are sources recovered from monte - carlo catalogues .",
    "@xmath21 is the number of pairs of real sources that fall within a bin of width @xmath22 in the map .",
    "@xmath23 are data - random pairs , and @xmath24 are random - random . for simplicity ,",
    "each catalogue is normalised to have the same number of objects . to obtain the random catalogues",
    ", we created 1000 mock fields based on the source count model used in the previous section , and the actual noise of the real data .",
    "the sources were placed randomly throughout the field , and the resulting mock data were placed into the same pipeline as our real data .",
    "this approach is slightly different from that of @xcite and @xcite , the only other two surveys to attempt a clustering analysis of scuba sources . in those analyses ,",
    "the mock images were modified only by adding noise to each pixel .",
    "the amount of noise added was taken from the noise map which was created along with the real signal map .",
    "therefore their final mock images do not exhibit the chop pattern that one would expect to see . recognizing this limitation",
    ", @xcite took the added step of masking out regions in the mock images that correspond to the positions of the off - beams in the real map .",
    "our simulations involve a full sampling of the mock images using the astrometry information from the real data .",
    "therefore the simulated and real maps have the same beam features .",
    "we used relatively wide 30 arcsec bins in because the number of sources is so low .",
    "this is also twice the size of the scuba beam at 850@xmath4 m , which was the binsize criterion used by @xcite .",
    "@xmath17 is estimated using both the 3.5 and @xmath25 catalogues .",
    "though some of @xmath26 sources may be spurious , the increased number of objects helps bring down the clustering error bars . as fig .",
    "[ fig : clusterwt ] shows , however , even when the @xmath26 sources are included there is no evidence for clustering in the hdf super - map , since there is no angular bin that has a @xmath17 significantly different from zero . for comparison in that figure , we also",
    "plot estimates of @xmath17 for eros and lbgs .",
    "we repeated this using bins half as wide , and again no significant deviation from zero was found .",
    "are shown as the open circles ( for the @xmath27 catalogue ) and filled circles ( for the @xmath28 catalogue ) .",
    "the points are plotted at the midpoint of each 30 arcsec bin .",
    "the first point is zero because there are no objects in the super - map closer than 30 arcsec to another .",
    "the measured clustering signal of eros is shown as a dashed line , and that of lbgs as a dotted line .",
    "there is no evidence of sub - mm clustering here , though the errors are still quite large.,width=288 ]    this is not the only clustering estimator one can use .",
    "we also performed a ` nearest - neighbour ' analysis ( see e.g.  scott & tout 1989 ) to test if sources were closer together than expected at random .",
    "this statistic simply examines the distribution of distances to the nearest neighbours for each source .",
    "the cummulant of nearest - neighbours is then compared against our set of monte - carlo catalogues to determine if a pair - wise clustering signal is present .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : clusternn ] .",
    "there is a lack of sources with neighbors closer than @xmath29 arcseconds , but a formal kolmogorov - smirnov test indicates only a @xmath30 chance that the distributions are significantly different .",
    "so there is no strong evidence of clustering here either .",
    "this is also reflected in the bottom panel , where we plot the cumulative distribution of nearest neighbours ( dots ) compared with monte - carlos ( solid line).,width=288 ]    note that in each of these clustering analyses , it is difficult to estimate the clustering strength on scales near to the beam size .",
    "our source extraction algorithm is insensitive to a fainter source closer than 12 arcsec to a brighter one .",
    "note that if scuba sources are clustered in a similar manner as eros or lbgs , then the signal in @xmath17 would be expected to be strongest at @xmath31 arcsec .",
    "this is only a factor of 2 larger than the scuba beam , and therefore one expects that a clustering detection with scuba will be rather difficult due to blending of the sources .",
    "our particular approach has not been optimised for separating nearby sources and hence our catalogue is not ideal for clustering analysis .",
    "future attempts to measure the clustering strength should pay particular care to source extraction algorithms .    there is currently no convincing detection of sub - mm clustering ; what is needed is a very large ( @xmath32 square degree ) survey with hundreds of sources in order to decrease the error bars on the clustering estimate .",
    "the on - going shades survey ( see _ http://www.roe.ac.uk/ifa/shades/ _ ) purports to do just that .",
    "we explored the range of parameters for the two - parameter model that could fit our source counts and still fall within the limits of the fir 850@xmath4mbackground constraint : @xmath33 . by calculating the integral of @xmath34",
    "we find that our @xmath35mjy sources contribute @xmath36mjy@xmath37 to the fib .",
    "this is consistent with estimates from several groups , and demonstrates that a significant fraction of the sub - mm universe is still below the flux threshold attainable from current scuba surveys .",
    "however , given the freedom which still exists in the faint end counts , and in the current level of uncertainty of the sub - mm background itself , the entire background can easily be made up of sources with @xmath38mjy .",
    "this result can be used to constrain models that predict the evolution of ir luminous galaxies .",
    "future surveys that detect more sources will constrain the source counts further , and extend the limiting flux down to fainter levels .",
    "the counts are much greater than what one obtains by estimating 850@xmath4 m  fluxes simply from the _ iras _",
    "60@xmath4 m  counts .",
    "as addressed by @xcite , a scuba galaxy with a flux @xmath39mjy has an inferred luminosity in excess of @xmath40 if they are distributed at redshifts greater than 0.5 .",
    "note that chapman et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find spectroscopic redshifts @xmath41 for each source in their sample of scuba detected radio galaxies .",
    "such sources make up at least 50% of the scuba population brighter than 5mjy , and radio _ undetected _ sources are likely to be at even higher redshifts .    at these luminosities",
    "the number of scuba objects per co - moving volume is several hundred times greater than it is today",
    ". therefore there must be significant evolution past @xmath42 ( the _ iras _ limiting redshift ) .",
    "modeling this evolution has been difficult due to the lack of observational data on the redshift distribution of scuba sources .",
    "attempts to model the luminosity evolution of the scuba sources have been carried out using semi - analytic methods ( e.g.  guiderdoni et al .",
    "1998 ) and parametric ones ( e.g.  blain et al .  1999 , rowan - robinson 2001 , chapman et al . 2003 ) . in many cases ,",
    "the starting point is the well determined _ iras _ luminosity function .",
    "this gives us the number of sources of a given luminosity per co - moving volume .",
    "these luminosities are then modified as a function of redshift , and then 850@xmath4mfluxes are extrapolated and source counts determined .",
    "we expect the number of galaxies to increase in the past due to merger activity , so number evolution must play some role , but it is noted that strong number evolution overproduces the fir background .",
    "there are many models ( and a range of parameters within them ) that fit the current data .",
    "therefore , until we can better constrain the counts and determine redshifts , the only firm conclusion one can make is that scuba sources do evolve strongly .",
    "our catalogue of 34 scuba sources within the hdf region , with the amount of multi - wavelength data being collected there , should contribute toward distinguishing between models .",
    "observations of local star - forming galaxies suggest that @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the 60@xmath4mluminosity ( rowan - robinson et al .",
    "1997 ) . assuming the slugs",
    "result for dust temperature and emissivity ( dunne et al .",
    "2002 ) , we calculate sfrs in excess of @xmath45yr@xmath46 for redshifts past about 1 .",
    "of course the conversion between detected flux and inferred star formation rate is highly dependent on the dust sed , and can change by factors of 10 for changes in temperature and @xmath47 of only 2 .",
    "also , the simple relation between fir luminosity and sfr may be different for these more luminous sources @xcite .    despite these uncertainties ,",
    "it has been suggested ( e.g.  blain et al .",
    "2002 , and references therein ) that scuba sources can be associated with the elliptical galaxies we see today via the following argument .",
    "producing the local massive elliptical population with a homogeneous stellar distribution requires a sustained period of star formation on the order of @xmath45yr@xmath46 lasting about 1gyr .",
    "based on results from chapman et al .",
    "( 2003 ) that place the bright scuba population at @xmath48 , the number of these galaxies per unit co - moving volume is comparable to the density of the local elliptical population .",
    "for example ,",
    "if we take our estimate of the counts above @xmath49mjy and assume that they cover a redshift range between 2 and 4 in a standard flat @xmath50-dominated model",
    ", we obtain a density of about @xmath51 .",
    "these are thus rare and extremely luminous objects , with comparable number densities to galaxy clusters or quasars .",
    "if scuba sources really are associated with elliptical galaxies , they should exhibit spatial clustering like their local counterparts .",
    "there are other reasons one might expect detectable clustering ; extremely red objects ( eros ) are very strongly clustered , and seem to have a correlation with scuba sources . in general objects associated with major mergers should show high amplitude clustering ( e.g.  percival et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "although our analyses show no sign of clustering , the data are not powerful enough to rule it out .",
    "to improve on this we need more detected sources in order to bring down the poisson error - bars .",
    "also , the ero and lbg clustering observations are taken from samples that exist at a common redshift ( @xmath32 in the case of eros and @xmath52 for lbgs ) . because of the strong negative k  correction , detected scuba sources are spread across a much wider redshift range , therefore diluting the clustering signal .",
    "hence , progress can only be made with a larger survey ( such as shades ) that also has the ability to discriminate redshifts , even if only crudely .",
    "although more studies are required to verify this claim , it is a reasonable hypothesis , and one with some testable predictions .",
    "our new catalogue of scuba sources ( table  2 ) should allow for future detailed comparison with other wavelength data , which facilitate such tests .",
    "this paper has presented the most complete accounting of sub - mm flux in the hdf - north region to date .",
    "we were able to demonstrates that @xmath1 scuba detections are quite robust , being consistently detected in independent observations of the same area .",
    "our catalogue of sources was obtained using a careful statistical approach , involving simulations with the same noise properties as the real data . at 850@xmath4 m",
    "we were able to extract 19 sources above @xmath25 and a further 15 likely sources above @xmath26 .",
    "such a large list , in a field with so much multi - wavelength data , should be extremely useful for further studies .",
    "our estimated source counts cover a wider flux density range than any other estimates , and given the careful completeness tests we carried out , they are likely to be more reliable than combining counts from different surveys . our counts of scuba sources verify that significant evolution of the local lirg population is required . extrapolating a fit to these counts to below @xmath53mjy can reasonably recover the entire fib at 850@xmath4 m . clustering , although anticipated to be strong , was not detected in our map , due largely to the limited number of sources . several hundred sub - mm sources with at least some redshift constraint will be required to detect the clustering unambiguously .",
    "the power of the scuba observations in the hdf - n lies not in the detection of objects per se , but rather for the ability to compare them with the plethora of existing and upcoming deep maps of this region at a wide variety of other wavelengths",
    ". some of these comparisons will be the focus of paper ii .",
