    "entanglement entropy measures a degree of the correlation between different subsystems of a quantum system . in many - body theories the quantum entanglement",
    "is usually determined when subsystems are spatially separated . a considerable attention has been paid in last few years to studying entanglement entropy in 2d spin - chain models near the critical point with the purpose to understand better collective effects in strongly correlated systems ( for a review of some of these results see @xcite ) .    in a similar way , one could pose the question about entanglement on the fundamental level , in a quantum gravity theory .",
    "it was conjectured in @xcite that for partition of the ground state by a plane the entanglement entropy per unit area of the plane is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the gravitational constant in the low - energy gravity sector of the theory .",
    "@xmath2 measures entanglement of all genuine microscopical degrees of freedom of the fundamental theory .",
    "relation ( [ 1.1 ] ) has been motivated by the black hole physics : the density of the bekenstein - hawking entropy per unit area of the black hole horizon is universal and equals @xmath3 . the fact that quantum entanglement and gravity are connected phenomena is interesting because one can study properties of the gravitational couplings in `` gravity analogs '' , by using entanglement entropy in condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "if the fundamental theory lives in a space - time with number of dimensions higher than four there is an issue of higher - dimensional extension of ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "there may be at least two options . in theories of the kaluza - klein ( kk )",
    "type all degrees of freedom propagate in the bulk . in this case partition of all kk modes by a hypersurface @xmath4 in four - dimensions is equivalent to partition of higher - dimensional fields by the surface @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a small compact space of @xmath7 extra - dimensions .",
    "if ( [ 1.1 ] ) is true the entanglement entropy should be @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the area of @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the volume of @xmath12 .",
    "equation ( [ 1.2 ] ) takes into account the relation @xmath13 , between higher - dimensional , @xmath14 , and low - dimensional , @xmath1 , gravitational couplings .",
    "the other option is the theories with large extra dimensions . in these theories",
    "the gravity remains higher - dimensional while matter fields are confined on a brane and do not propagate in the bulk . for this reason , the way how the separating surface is extended in extra - dimensions should be determined by the bulk gravity equations .",
    "there is a particular example where this issue can be investigated : the randall - sundrum model where the bulk is the anti - de sitter ( ads ) gravity .",
    "if @xmath4 is a separating hypersurface in the brane theory , its extension @xmath12 has to be a minimal surface embedded in the ads space .",
    "the boundary of @xmath12 on the brane is @xmath4 . with this prescription",
    "the entropy in the brane theory takes the form ( [ 1.2 ] ) , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the gravitational constant in the bulk and @xmath17 is the number of dimensions on the brane .    equation ( [ 1.3 ] ) is the `` holographic formula '' which was first suggested by ryu and takayanagi @xcite , @xcite for the entropy of conformal field theories ( cft ) which admit a dual description in terms of the ads gravity one dimension higher .",
    "the remarkable property of the result of @xcite , @xcite is that ( [ 1.3 ] ) enables one to study quantum entanglement in strongly correlated systems , such as strongly coupled gauge theories , where the direct field theoretical ( qft ) computations for the entropy are extremely difficult .",
    "ryu and takayanagi presented an intuitive derivation of ( [ 1.3 ] ) by using ads / cft correspondence @xcite@xcite and provided some examples in its support .",
    "the analysis of @xcite , @xcite was restricted by static problems and @xmath12 was assumed to be a static minimal surface in a lorenzian ads background . in @xcite equation (",
    "[ 1.3 ] ) was used to argue that the entropy of a black hole in a braneworld model in three dimensions is an entanglement entropy . in @xcite implications of ( [ 1.3 ] ) were considered for the entropy of a de sitter brane .",
    "the main purpose of our work is to understand better where and at which conditions relation ( [ 1.3 ] ) comes from .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "the proof of the holographic formula is given in section 2 .",
    "for a finite - temperature theory the entanglement entropy can be derived in a statistical mechanical manner from a partition function @xmath18 of the boundary cft .",
    "@xmath18 is defined on a class of riemannian manifolds @xmath19 ( manifolds with the euclidean signature ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a natural number , can be interpreted as an inverse `` temperature '' . by using the ads / cft conjecture",
    "we write @xmath18 as a path integral in the bulk ads gravity with the boundary condition that the conformal boundary of `` hystories '' @xmath22 involved in the path integral belongs to the conformal class of @xmath19 .",
    "the bulk spaces have conical singularities on codimension 2 hypersurfaces @xmath12 which are `` holographically dual '' to the separating surface @xmath4 in the boundary cft .",
    "evaluation of the path integral in the saddle point approximation picks up a space @xmath22 where the classical ads gravity action has an extremum .",
    "the variational principle for the action implies that @xmath12 has to be a minimal surface embedded in a riemannian ads background .",
    "it then immediately follows that in the saddle point approximation the entanglement entropy is given by ( [ 1.3 ] ) .",
    "the derivation of ( [ 1.3 ] ) answers some questions left open in @xcite , @xcite and makes the statement more precise .",
    "for instance , the topology of a riemannian space puts restrictions on the choice of the minimal hypersurface under chosen boundary conditions .",
    "connection of the entanglement entropy with the path integral in ads gravity enables one to study entanglement in the theories which are stationary but not static and to consider theories with different phases .",
    "in section 3 we study consequences of ( [ 1.3 ] ) in rs brane - world scenario .",
    "in particular , we derive the asymptotic geometrical structure of the entropy when the curvature radius of the brane is much larger than the ads radius .",
    "in section 4 a general form of the `` anomalous term '' in the entropy is given in four - dimensional brane theories , including the case when @xmath4 has non - vanishing extrinsic curvatures .",
    "modification of the holographic formula by the higher curvature terms in the bulk action is briefly analyzed in section 5 .",
    "we discuss our results in section 6 .",
    "it is emphasized that if the corrections caused by the curvature of the brane are neglected the area density of the ground state entanglement entropy in the theory on the brane is given by ( [ 1.1 ] ) where @xmath1 is the newton coupling in the gravity induced on the brane , in complete agreement with the suggestion of @xcite .",
    "0      in analogy with ( [ 2.1 ] ) we formulate the method of computing entanglement entropy @xmath36 in the boundary cft in terms of the path integral over ads metrics .",
    "we start with a recipe of computing @xmath36 in a qft described in detail in @xcite .",

    "the state of the system , can be described in general by the density matrix @xmath40 and in what follows we assume that it is a state at temperature @xmath41 . the ground state can be obtained in the limit of zero temperature . when applying our results to conformal theories which have ads duals , @xmath39 can be , for example , a hyperplane @xmath42 , a hypersphere @xmath43 , or a lobachevsky hyperbolic space @xmath44 , see @xcite . in these cases @xmath28 is @xmath45 , @xmath46 , or @xmath47",
    ". there may be more complicated situations which we mention below .",

    "the entanglement entropy is defined as the von neumann entropy @xmath51        analogously , one can define the entanglement entropy @xmath52 in the region @xmath49 by tracing the density matrix over the states located in the region @xmath48 .",
    "if the system is in a pure state @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath54 , it is not difficult to show that @xmath55 , see @xcite . in what follows",
    "we do all our computations for the entropy in @xmath48 . to simplify the notations we write the entropy and all associated objects without subscript 1 .",
    "distinctions in the entropies for different regions will be explained below .",
    "the definition of @xmath19 and @xmath58 is as follows . if @xmath59 ( [ 2.4 ] ) coincides with the partition function of the given field @xmath37 in space @xmath39 at finite temperature @xmath41 .",
    "the background manifold in this case is @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the circle of the length @xmath62 . to obtain @xmath19 for @xmath63 one has to take @xmath21 copies of @xmath28 each with a cut along @xmath48 and glue them along the cuts as is shown on fig .",
    "the entanglement entropy is given by the equation @xcite @xmath64 the operation with the parameter @xmath65 in ( [ 2.5 ] ) should be understood in the following way : one first computes @xmath58 for @xmath20 , and then replaces @xmath65 with a continuous parameter .",
    "this can be done even if @xmath19 itself can not be defined at arbitrary @xmath65 .",
    "it will be important for us that ( [ 2.5 ] ) coincides with the formula for the entropy in statistical mechanics if @xmath58 is interpreted as a partition function and @xmath66 as a temperature should not be confused with the physical temperature @xmath41 . ] .    in the same way , by cutting @xmath21 copies of @xmath28 and gluing along @xmath49 one",

    "let us emphasize that definition ( [ 2.5 ] ) can be also applied to the entropy in theories which are stationary but not static . to give an example ,",
    "suppose that @xmath39 has an axial isometry generated by a killing vector field @xmath67 .",
    "one can study the entanglement entropy in the frame of reference which rigidly rotates with an angular velocity @xmath68 .",
    "the space @xmath24 is a torus which is obtained by identifications @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( i.e. , along the trajectories generated by @xmath67 and @xmath71 ) .",
    "gluing @xmath21 copies of @xmath24 along the cut @xmath48 yields @xmath19 .",
    "computation of the entanglement entropy in this setting has to be accompanied by the change @xmath72 to @xmath73 in the final results .",
    "description of `` hystories '' in ( [ 2.6 ] ) is parallel to the construction of @xmath19 .",
    "first , one considers all ads geometries whose asymptotic boundaries are from the conformal class of @xmath28 .",
    "we denote these geometries @xmath23 .",
    "then , one makes different cuts of @xmath23 along @xmath17dimensional hypersurfaces @xmath76 .",
    "one requires that the asymptotic boundary of @xmath76 is conformal to the cut @xmath48 in @xmath28 .",
    "this boundary condition does not fix @xmath76 uniquely .",
    "there may be different cuts of @xmath23 which have this property . finally , by taking @xmath21 identical copies of @xmath23 with the same cut @xmath76 and gluing them along the cuts",
    "one gets a space @xmath22 with the required boundary condition .    integral ( [ 2.6 ] ) can be computed in the saddle point approximation .",
    "to do the computation one has to take into account that @xmath22 have conical singularities which lie on @xmath38-dimensional hypersurfaces @xmath12 where all @xmath21 cuts meet .",
    "the surplus of the conical angle around each point of @xmath12 is @xmath77 .",
    "the classical action ( [ 2.2 ] ) in this case should be @xmath78 @xmath79 the integral in the r.h.s .",
    "of ( [ 2.7 ] ) goes over the regular region @xmath80 of @xmath22 . the delta - function like singularities in the curvature @xmath81 at @xmath12 result in the last term in the r.h.s . of ( [ 2.7 ] ) where @xmath82 is the volume of @xmath12 .",
    "as in ( [ 2.2 ] ) one considers a cut of the bulk manifold at some @xmath17-dimensional hypersurface @xmath83 to avoid the volume divergences .",
    "the space @xmath83 has conical singularities and one might worry that they yield additional boundary terms .",
    "the structure of possible boundary terms could be @xmath84 where the integral goes over @xmath38-dimensional hypersurface @xmath85 , a location of singular points on @xmath34 , with the determinant of the metric @xmath86 .",
    "function @xmath87 should be a local invariant of all possible combinations of internal , @xmath88 , and external , @xmath89 , characteristics of @xmath85 .",
    "the problem is that @xmath90 has to have the dimension of the length , while the invariants have the dimension of the inverse length in some non - negative power .",
    "note also that one can not use the ads radius @xmath91 to construct combinations with required dimensionality because the form of boundary terms ( for off - shell metrics ) does not depend on the presence of the cosmological constant in the bulk .",
    "thus , we conclude that conical singularities do not generate boundary terms .      one can use now ( [ 2.5 ] ) and ( [ 2.7 ] ) to get holographic formula ( [ 1.3 ] ) for the entanglement entropy in a cft theory @xmath97 @xmath98        let us summarize conditions for ( [ 2.12 ] ) .",

    "the boundary @xmath99 does not have other elements .",
    "the last condition enables one to understand why in general the entanglement entropy in the region @xmath48 is different from the entanglement in its completion @xmath49 .",
    "this happens when there are no cuts in @xmath23 connecting @xmath49 to @xmath12 .",
    "the latter situation occurs at finite temperatures for topological reasons .",
    "let us illustrate it by using @xmath100 .",

    "0    the main purpose of our work was to give a proof of the holographic formula ( [ 1.3 ] ) for the entanglement entropy in qft s which have a dual description in terms of the ads gravity .",
    "in section 2 we have formulated conditions under which ( [ 1.3 ] ) can be applied . in particular",
    ", we demonstrated that @xmath12 , a holographic dual of the separating surface @xmath4 , has to be embedded in a riemannian ads space .",
    "we also pointed out topological obstructions on the choice of @xmath12 .",
    "our analysis incorporates static problems discussed in @xcite , @xcite , as well as the case of static black holes on the brane when the separating surface is associated to the black hole horizon @xcite .",
    "it also allows one to extend computations in stationary but non - static theories along the lines explained in section 2 .",
    "let us return to formula ( [ 1.1 ] ) and compare it with result ( [ 3.9 ] ) obtained in the rs braneworld model .",
    "suppose that the braneworld geometry is flat , @xmath206 .",

    "the density of entanglement entropy @xmath208 per unit area of @xmath4 becomes @xmath209 in agreement with ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "in general there should be corrections to ( [ 3.11 ] ) when @xmath28 and @xmath4 are not flat .    according to ( [ 3.11 ] ) quantum entanglement of the degrees of freedom of the fundamental gravity theory can be measured in terms of the gravitational coupling @xmath141 on the brane .",

    "the genuine degrees of freedom are related to the string theory which provides an exact expression @xmath212 , where @xmath213 , @xmath214 and @xmath215 is the string length .",
    "we do not give a direct microscopical counting of the entanglement entropy on the brane .",
    "our analysis is suggestive .",
    "however , the described picture is very similar to that in condensed matter models .",
    "consider the ground state entanglement entropy @xmath36 in the spin chains near the critical point @xcite , for instance , in the ising model . here",
    "the entropy can be directly derived from the density matrix determined by the ising hamiltonian . near the critical point",
    "the ising model corresponds to a 2d qft with two massive fermion fields .",
    "this qft at the critical point becomes a conformal theory .",
    "thus , the alternative derivation of @xmath36 can be given in terms of the effective qft with the uv cutoff associated with the inverse lattice spacing .",
    "the two derivations yield the same result for @xmath36 , see the details in @xcite .",
