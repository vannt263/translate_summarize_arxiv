    "the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation @xcite deals with a  preexisting  quantum field theory ( qft ) object defined as a vacuum expectation value of the t - ordered product of heisenberg field operators @xcite .",
    "for the two - body case in a scalar theory ( @xmath0 ) , this object has the expression @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the state vector with total momentum @xmath3 .    after removing some trivial dependence related to translational invariance , @xmath4 its fourier",
    "transform @xmath5 defines the momentum space bs amplitude .",
    "bethe and salpeter wrote a covariant 4d integral equation for the amplitude @xmath6 , which for the two - body bound state reads @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the free constituent propagators and @xmath9 the interaction kernel .",
    "if the propagators were dressed and the kernel was a sum of all the irreducible feynman graphs of the theory , solving ( [ bs_bs ] ) would be equivalent to solve the full qft .",
    "this is however a wishful thinking . in practice",
    "only very poor representations of the interaction are used : most of nuclear physics calculations use ladder approximation and free propagators , though dressed propagators are systematically used in the schwinger - dyson approach @xcite .",
    "there could be some misunderstanding on what bs amplitude denotes : either the quantity ( [ phi_qft ] ) computed whit the full qft solution or the quantity @xmath10 obtained by solving ( [ bs_bs ] ) with a  necessarily  truncated interaction kernel .",
    "these quantities can strongly differ from each other , but we live with it .",
    "besides the bound states equation ( [ bs_bs ] ) , we have also considered the corresponding scattering equation for the process @xmath11 .",
    "the two - body scattering amplitude @xmath12 satisfies an inhomogeneous bs equation which , for spinless particles in minkowski space , reads : @xmath13   \\left[\\left(\\frac{p}{2}-k'\\right)^2-m^2+i\\epsilon\\right]}\\ ] ] with @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this equation is plagued with singularities : _",
    "( i ) _ in the two - body propagators , _",
    "( ii ) _ in most of the interaction kernels even the simplest ones , _ ( iii ) _ in the ( inhomogeneous ) born term and _ ( iv ) _ in the amplitude @xmath16 itself , being difficult to represent it in terms of smooth functions . to avoid these troubles  and get some bound state solutions  wick proposed @xcite to introduce a new variable @xmath17 in terms of wich the 4d minkowski metric is changed into an euclidean one : @xmath18 this change of metric leads to a smooth integral equation for the euclidean amplitude , related to the minkowski one by @xmath19 which is easily solvable by standard methods . until very recently most of the existing solutions were found in this way .",
    "the are however some problems in performing the so called wick rotation :    1 .",
    "it is not a simple change of variable but underlies an application of the cauchy theorem with two different integration contours .",
    "the equivalence of both theories  minkowski and euclidean  requires a careful analysis of the singularities crossed when moving from one to other .",
    "for the bound state case , the singularities come only in the interaction kernel and the validity has been proved only for simple cases . for the scattering case , they come also in the propagators and the corresponding residues must be taken into account .",
    "the total mass @xmath20 of the system is invariant under such transformation but the amplitude not . in practice",
    "it is very difficult  if possible at all  to recover @xmath21 from @xmath22 ( see contribution @xcite ) 3 .",
    "other observable  scattering amplitudes , form factors  are defined and computable in terms of minkowski amplitudes .",
    "it is worth noticing , however , that the distinction between euclidean and minkowski amplitues is meaningful only when keeping for both of them real arguments @xmath23 and @xmath24 and the later statement must be understood in this conventional sense .",
    "euclidean amplitudes with imaginary arguments @xcite are equivalent to minkowski ones and can lead to correct results .",
    "all these reasons motivated several authors to solve the bs equation in minkowski space , first for the bound state @xcite and later for the scattering problem @xcite . obtaining these numerical solution is indeed quite difficult and was not tried until very recently .",
    "some years ago we proposed @xcite a method based on an integral transform of the original bs equation which make all things regular .",
    "it was inspired by the relation between the light - front ( lf ) wave function @xmath25 and the bs amplitude @xmath10 @xmath26 this integral transform , denoted symbollicaly by @xmath27 , maps the singular bs amplitude into a smooth wave function @xmath25 and was applied to the full bs equation ( [ bs_bs ] ) according to @xmath28 in order to use the same unknown function on both sides of ( [ formal ] ) and avoid the inversion of @xmath29 , we have used the nakanishi representation @xcite of the bs amplitude @xmath30 ^ 3 }     \\ ; g(\\gamma , z)\\ ] ] and obtained an integral equation for the nakanishi weight function @xmath31 , on the form : @xmath32 the details of this derivation and the analytic expressions of the kernels can be found in @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath31 is metric - independent and finite although it can display  at least for zero energy scattering  heaviside - like discontinuities @xcite .",
    "all the minkowski space poles of @xmath10 are contained in the denominator of ( [ naka ] ) .",
    "once @xmath31 is known , the bs amplitude  either in minkowski or in euclidean space  can be computed by means of ( [ naka ] ) .",
    "a similar , one - dimensional , expression exists for the light - front wave function @xmath25 in terms of @xmath31 @xcite @xmath33 ^ 2}\\ ] ] these two possibilites make the nakanishi weight function @xmath31 especialy well adapted for establishing a relation between euclidean and minkowski bs solutions .",
    "indeed , if @xmath31 could be determined either from the lf wave function  inverting ( [ psi_g ] )  or from an euclidean bs solution  inverting ( [ naka ] )  it could be used to computed the minkowski amplitude and related observables .",
    "care must be taken however @xcite with the ill - defined character in the numerical inversion of ( [ naka ] ) and ( [ psi_g ] ) .",
    "further applications of this lf / nakanishi approach have been developed in the recent years .    * the solutions of ( [ lfn_bs ] ) were used to compute the electromagnetic form factors @xcite in terms of @xmath31 . *",
    "equation ( [ lfn_bs ] ) was generalized to the two - fermion system .",
    "the usual one - boson exchange kernels have been dervied and the bound state solution for the @xmath34 states with the yukawa coupling have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "* in @xcite , equation ( [ lfn_bs ] ) was written in the form @xmath35 .",
    "this non trivial analytic inversion of the left - hand - side kernel of ( [ lfn_bs ] ) , allows to compute unambiguously the function @xmath31 and study its analytic properties .",
    "the bound state solutions found by solving this equation were in perfect agreement with the preceding results .",
    "the equation was extended to the scattering states and the scattering length could be accurately computed @xcite .",
    "a second method was developed in @xcite aiming to directly solve the original equation without any transform and taking into account all the singularities of equation ( [ bse ] ) .",
    "this direct approach has proved its efficiency both for the bound and , especially , for the scattering states .",
    "it provided for the first time the full off - shell scattering amplitude at the price of a careful analytical work to transform all the singular terms , from the kernels as well as from the propagators , into a smooth integrands .",
    "for instance , the bs equation for the s - wave can be written in the following form    @xmath36 \\cr                      & - &     \\frac{\\pi}{2 m } \\int_0^{\\infty } \\frac{{k'}^2 dk'}{\\varepsilon_{k ' } ( 2\\varepsilon_{k'}+m ) }       w_0^s(k_0,k , a_+,k ' ) f_0(a_+,k ' )    \\cr                   & + &   \\frac{i}{2 m }   \\int_0^{\\infty }   \\frac{{k'}^2dk ' } { \\varepsilon_{k ' } }    \\int_0^{\\infty } dk'_0 \\left [ \\frac { w^s_{0}(k_0,k , k'_0,k ' ) f_0(k'_0,k ' )   - w^s_{0}(k_0,k , a_-,k ' )   f_0(|a_- |,k ' ) } {   { k'}_0 ^ 2-a_-^2 } \\right ]   \\cr                  & - &     \\frac{i}{2 m }   \\int_0^{\\infty } \\frac{{k'}^2dk ' } { \\varepsilon_{k ' } }      \\int_0^{\\infty } dk'_0 \\left [ \\frac { w^s_{0}(k_0,k , k'_0,k ' ) f_0(k'_0,k ' )   - w^s_{0}(k_0,k , a_+,k ' ) f_0(a_+,k ' ) }   { { k'}_0 ^ 2-a_+^2 } \\right ]   \\label{eqd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath37 is the s - wave kernels and @xmath38 the corresponding born term .",
    "notice , apart from the inhomogeneous term , the existence of zero- , one- and two - dimensional integral terms .",
    "the details of the derivation and some illustrative results can be found in @xcite .",
    "having computed the scattering solutions , the corresponding `` bound @xmath39 scattering state '' transition electromagnetic form factor was found in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the bound state case , the scattering bs equation can not be in general transformed into an equation for the euclidean amplitude @xmath40 alone .",
    "indeed , let us consider equation ( [ bse ] ) and assume we want to obtain from it an equation for the euclidean amplitude @xmath40 defined in ( [ f_e ] ) .",
    "in order to properly apply the wick rotation , we have to take into account the pole singularities associated with the propagators in ( [ bse ] ) which are given by @xmath41 with @xmath42 in the case @xmath43 , their positions in the complex @xmath44-plane are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] . when the integration contour is rotated , the singularities @xmath45 and @xmath46 are crossed and the corresponding residues of the integrand at these poles will contribute to the integral term .     plane ( @xmath43).,width=283 ]    equation ( [ bse ] ) is then transformed into : @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are respectively the wick - rotated interaction kernel and born term .",
    "we emphasize that the obtained equation does not simply follow from the original one after the variable change @xmath50 .",
    "the additional term @xmath51 is the contribution of the two poles @xmath45 and @xmath46 displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that @xmath51 depends on the minkowski amplitude at the particular value of its @xmath44 argument @xmath52 consequently , when rotating the initial bs scattering equation , the euclidean and minkowski amplitudes are in general coupled and one can not obtain a scattering equation involving @xmath40 alone .    a second integral equation is required and after some algebraic manipulations @xcite one ends with a system of two coupled integral equations involving both @xmath53 and @xmath53 and denoted simbolically @xmath54   \\cr f_m(\\varepsilon_{k_s } - \\varepsilon_{k } , \\vec{k } )   & = & { \\cal i}_2 [   f_e(k'_4,\\vec{k } ' ) , f_m(\\varepsilon_{k_s } - \\varepsilon_{k'},\\vec{k } ' ) ]   \\label{2ceq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this system of equations ",
    "whose minkowski part remains singular  was first derived in @xcite , re - derived and solved in @xcite to check our direct minkowski solution @xmath53 at the particular value @xmath55 .",
    "the solution of ( [ 2ceq ] ) provides @xmath40 in the full domain but @xmath53 is limited to a restricted manifold and does not provide the full solution of the scattering problem .",
    "however , on mass - shell @xmath56 and since @xmath57 , the euclidean amplitude computed this way can be also used to obtain the phase shifts .",
    "the results provided by our direct method ( [ eqd ] ) are in agreement with the solution of ( [ 2ceq ] ) and with those of @xcite .      of particular interest",
    "is the zero energy scattering .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that in the limit @xmath58 the term @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ bsec ] ) vanishes and the four - dimensional bs equation for the euclidean amplitude in the zero energy limit takes the form @xmath59 this is a self - consistent integral equation for determining @xmath60 without any coupling to the minkowski amplitude @xmath16 .",
    "this decoupling is valid only in the limit @xmath61 .    in the s - wave case ,",
    "( [ bsec0 ] ) reduces to the following two - dimensional integral equation : @xmath62 with @xmath63 and where we have omitted the superscript on @xmath64 .",
    "this equation determines the s - wave zero energy half - mass shell scattering amplitude @xmath65 .",
    "the scattering length is given by @xmath66 a more detailed derivation can be found in @xcite .",
    "the interest in deriving equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is not only a significant simplification in computing the bs scattering length but in the fact that this fundamental quantity can be obtained from a purely euclidean solution .",
    "although considered here in the approximate framework of bs equation , the `` exact '' euclidean amplitude ( [ phi_qft ] )  solution of the full qft problem  is nowadays accessible in the lattice approach .",
    "it is the basic ingredient of the hal - qcd collaboration to obtain the _ ab initio _ nucleon - nucleon potential from qcd @xcite but it has never been used to extract the scattering observables .",
    "the possibility to compute a scattering amplitude from euclidean correlators in infinite space is forbidden by the maiani - testa theorem @xcite .",
