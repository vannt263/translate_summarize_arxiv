    "one of the outstanding issues in neutrino physics today is to clarify the dirac or majorana character of neutrino masses . if neutrinos are dirac particles , they must have right - handed electroweak singlet components in addition to the known left - handed modes ; in such case lepton number remains as a conserved quantity",
    "alternatively , if they are majorana particles , they are indistinguishable from their antiparticles , and the lepton number in the reactions involving them may be violated .",
    "the nature of the neutrinos can be discerned via detection of neutrinoless double beta decays ( @xmath12 ) in nuclei @xcite , by considering specific scattering processes @xcite , or by studying rare meson decays @xcite .",
    "the experimental results to date are unable to distinguish between these two alternatives .    among the principal tasks in neutrino physics are the ascertainment of the nature of the neutrino mass ( dirac or majorana ) and the cp violation in the neutrino sector .",
    "the measurement of neutrino oscillations @xcite suggests that the first three neutrinos are not massless but very light particles , with masses less than 1 ev . if these light masses are produced via a seesaw @xcite or related mechanism , then the existence of significantly heavier neutrinos is expected .",
    "furthermore , there is a possibility of cp violation in the neutrino sector , both if neutrinos are dirac or majorana particles . in the majorana case ,",

    "we consider a scenario of two additional , sterile , almost degenerate neutrinos @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) with masses @xmath18 mev .",
    "such neutrinos are not typically predicted by seesaw scenarios ; nonetheless , there are models which predict such neutrinos @xcite , and they are not ruled out by experiments @xcite .",

    "<S> we study the pion decays with intermediate on - shell neutrinos @xmath0 into two electrons and a muon , @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the branching ratios @xmath2/\\gamma(\\pi^- \\to { \\rm all})$ ] and the cp asymmetry ratio @xmath3 for such decays , in the scenario with two different on - shell neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath0 is dirac , only the lepton number conserving ( lc ) decays contribute ( lc : @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) ; if @xmath0 is majorana , both lc and lepton number violating ( lv ) decays contribute ( lv : @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that the cp asymmetry @xmath8 is in general very small , but increases and becomes @xmath9 when the masses of the two intermediate neutrinos get closer to each other , i.e. , when their mass difference becomes comparable with their decay width , @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of cp violation in pion decays would be consistent with the existence of the well - motivated @xmath11msm model with two almost degenerate heavy neutrinos . </S>"
