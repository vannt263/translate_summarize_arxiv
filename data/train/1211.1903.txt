    "an effective method , that resolves the _ degeneracy _ , is proposed by s. wang @xcite for the black - scholes equation with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "the method is based on a finite volume formulation of the problem , coupled with a fitted local approximation to the solution and an implicit time - stepping technique .",
    "the local approximation is determined by a set of two - point boundary value problems ( bvps ) , defined on the element edges .",
    "this fitted technique originates from one - dimensional computational fluid dynamics @xcite .",

    "the resulting equation has variable coefficients but this is not an essential difficulty for the numerical computation .",
    "however , the transformed equation _ degenerates _ at both ends of the finite interval .    the present paper deals with a degenerate parabolic equation , , derived after transformation of the generalized black - scholes equation to a finite interval . the degeneration at the both ends of the interval does not allow the use of the poincar - friedrichs inequality and we are forced to investigate the differential problem with the grding inequality rather than classical coercivity @xcite .",
