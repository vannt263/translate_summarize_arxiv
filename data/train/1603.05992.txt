    "in recent years , the unprecedented increase in the sensitivity of the space - based as well as the ground - based observations has revolutionized our understanding of high redshift ( @xmath4@xmath82 ) galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this large reservoir of star - forming galaxies ( sfgs ) has tremendous implications on our understanding of the process of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "lyman alpha ( ly@xmath3 ) is typically the strongest uv emission line in sfgs and a crucial spectroscopic signature to confirm high redshift galaxies selected based on their colors .",
    "the first studies of ly@xmath3 emitters ( laes ) predicted that they could represent the first galaxies in formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although originally predicted to be extremely young , recent studies have shown that laes have a variety of ages , from 1 myr to 1 gyr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , range in dust extinction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a wide range in stellar masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such a large diversity in physical properties of laes implies that these are not galaxies undergoing their first burst of star formation .",
    "it is also puzzling that some laes show high dust content as ly@xmath3 photons can not easily escape from dusty galaxies because they are resonantly scattered by neutral hydrogen .",
    "these results , which are based on both narrow - band ( nb ) as well as broad - band selection , show a wide range of stellar properties for laes which contradicts early predictions of laes as young , first galaxies . in the era of large surveys , it is now possible to study statistically significant sample of these galaxies at all redshifts and get better insight into the physical nature of laes , which has important implications on our understanding of evolutionary properties of galaxies and the state of intergalactic medium ( igm ) in the early universe .",
    "the vuds observations were done using the low - resolution multi - slit mode of vimos on the vlt .",
    "a total of 15 vimos pointings ( @xmath0224 arcmin@xmath9 each , @xmath01 deg@xmath9 total ) were observed covering the full wavelength range from 3650  to 9350  in three deep survey fields ( ecdfs , vvds-02h , cosmos ) , which has extensive multi - wavelength data .",
    "the primary selection criterion for galaxies in the vuds program was photometric redshifts .",
    "therefore , the targets for the vuds program include a representative sample of all sfgs at a particular redshift within a given magnitude limit ( @xmath1@xmath225  mag , with some galaxies as faint as @xmath1@xmath027  mag ) .",
    "a detailed discussion about these observations , data reduction process , target selection , reliability of the redshift measurements and corresponding quality flags is presented in @xcite .",
    "we select all vuds objects between @xmath4=2 and @xmath4=6 , keeping only the best reliability flags ( 2,3,4,9 )  which gives very high probability ( 75 - 85% , 95 - 100% , 100% , 80% , respectively ; see @xcite for details ) for these redshifts to be correct .",

    "a small difference in sed - based stellar parameters , between laes and non - laes , points to the fact that the escape of ly@xmath3 emission from galaxies is a complex process , and could be affected by intrinsic properties of these galaxies which includes , the dust content / geometry , morphology , kinematics and interstellar medium geometry , and/or change in the lyman continuum escape fraction .",
