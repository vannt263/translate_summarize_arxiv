    "we find that the f atom forms a site with large attractive potential , since one transmission peak appears at very low energy ( at about @xmath57 ev ) .",
    "we note that the resonance level at @xmath25 does not attain a transmission of 1 . while an f ad - atom forms a neutral cluster with the adjacent li atom , an intra - chain f atom couples to both li neighbors and acts as strong attractive potential .",
    "we have investigated the influence of impurities on the transmission of metallic and insulating monovalent li chains . we have demonstrated that an impurity connected to a single atom of the chain leads to a splitting of the zero - energy peak , causing a strong dependence of the conductance on structural details of the scatterer .",
    "an impurity connected to two atoms of the chain with equal distance , on the other hand , switches the system from insulating to metallic behavior , or vice versa .",
    "the transmission coefficient , however , in both cases shows a minimum at @xmath25 as a consequence of the charge transfer with the leads .",
    "charge transfer with the leads prohibits a prediction of details of the transmission spectrum by tight - binding models of the scatterer .",
    "electronegative ad - atoms localize electrons in the chain but do not decouple it , whereas electronegative impurities within the chain result in low - lying transmitting levels and , thus , shift the spectrum to higher energy .",
