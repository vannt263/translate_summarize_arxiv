    "rheological electro- and magnetofluids are very flexible systems where long - range dipolar interactions lead to self - organized filamentation . since its discovery in ferrofluids by de gennes and pincus @xcite , this phenomenon has been intensely studied in classical systems @xcite .",
    "this is typically done using monte carlo simulations of hard- and soft - sphere dipolar particles @xcite and comparison can subsequently be made to experiments with colloids that display many intriguing phases @xcite .",
    "important technological applications can be found in nanostructuring using atomic lithography @xcite and in colloidal quantum dot photovoltiac devices @xcite .",
    "however , as the systems become increasingly smaller one must start to consider also quantum aspects of the structure and the dynamics .",
    "the explosive experimental development in ultracold atoms has lead to a wealth of new possibilities in terms of simulating the properties of condensed - matter systems with extensive control over both quantum statistics , interactions , and geometry @xcite .",
    "building on this success , a great deal of effort has been put into the cooling of rydberg atoms , permanent magnetic dipole moment atoms , homo- and heteronuclear molecules , and samples of near - degenerate polar molecules can now be produced @xcite . these systems",
    "provide access to strong dipole - dipole forces that are long - range and anisotropic @xcite .",
    "in particular , in low - dimensional geometries it has been shown that the systems are more stable towards two - body chemical reaction loss @xcite and to many - body instabilities @xcite .",
    "here we focus on a system consisting of polar molecules that are restricted to move in a stack of two - dimensional planes .",
    "this setup resembles the classical ferrofluids and colloidal systems with the major exception that for degenerate or near - degenerate ultracold molecules the system is intrinsically quantum and physics beyond the classical regime can be addressed .",
    "an external field can be used to align the dipoles @xcite , and we assume they are always perpendicular to the layer planes . theoretically , a host of interesting few- @xcite and many - body @xcite states have been predicted in single- and multilayer systems .",
    "for very large dipole moments , a triangular crystal phase has been predicted @xcite that is similar to the wigner crystal of the electron gas @xcite .    in the current investigation , we are interested in the so - called dipolar chain liquid proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for bosonic molecules and later also for fermionic molecules @xcite . for perpendicularly oriented dipoles , the longest chain possible ( one molecule in each layer ) is always the most bound structure @xcite . in the case of bosons",
    ", it was found that the longest chain will condense below a critical temperature @xcite which depends slightly on whether internal vibrational modes of the chain are included @xcite .",
    "this has been confirmed by a recent monte carlo study @xcite , where a lattice model was employed .",
    "common to all the studies mentioned is that they neglect the repulsive intralayer interaction of the polar molecules .",
    "here we include this effect in a parametric approach and considered the implications on thermodynamic quantities such as entropy and heat capacity .",
    "thermodynamic variables have been addressed experimentally in the case of the short - range interacting cold atomic gases . in particular",
    ", density fluctuation measurements can determine compressibility and heat capacity @xcite .",
    "since absorption imaging has been demonstrated also for polar molecules @xcite , these measurements should be possible for such systems as well .",
    "below we present results for the thermodynamic behavior of two- and three - chain systems for any number of layers . in the case of two chains ,",
    "we determine the partition function analytically .",
    "three chains requires , however , numerical calculation of the degeneracy of many - body states of given total energy .",
    "our formalism is based on an effective harmonic approximation for the two - body interactions to reduce the hamiltonian to an exactly solvable form .",
    "naturally , this requires a careful choice of parameters for the effective harmonic interactions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ method ]",
    "we discuss the hamiltonian and the various approximations we make . as a warm - up",
    ", we discuss in section  [ single ] the case of a single chain , before moving onto the case of two- and three - chain systems in section  [ multi ] .",
    "the resulting thermodynamic results are presented in section  [ results ] , along with a discussion of experimentally relevant systems . in section  [ sumcon ]",
    "we summarize our approach and results , and give an outlook for future investigations .",

    "we show the choice of coordinate system.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "the system we consider is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] . in general",
    ", we have @xmath1 molecules of mass @xmath2 and dipole moment @xmath3 in a layered setup with equidistant layers separated by a distance @xmath4 .",
    "the layers are assumed to be infinitely thin and allow no interlayer tunneling",
    ". this will be the case for a deep optical lattice potential .",
    "we assume that the dipoles are all oriented perpendicular to the layers , in which case we have the interlayer potential @xmath5 where @xmath6 are relative coordinates of two polar molecules that are restricted to move in planes located a distance @xmath7 apart ( i.e. adjacent planes have @xmath8 and so forth ) .",
    "it is convenient to define the dipolar strength , @xmath9 , and to measure all energies in units of @xmath10 , and all temperatures in units of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "we will also denote the relative radial distance between two molecules by @xmath13 .",
    "the interaction between two molecules in the same layer is found by simply setting @xmath14 in eq .  , i.e. @xmath15 a purely repulsive dipolar term .",
    "the hamiltonian for the @xmath1-body system is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the relative coordinate of the pair @xmath18 with @xmath19 , and the factor of @xmath20 is for double counting .",
    "@xmath21 is an index that denotes the distance ( in units of @xmath4 ) between the layers containing molecules @xmath22 and @xmath23 . for @xmath24 , @xmath25 and for @xmath26 , @xmath27 . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that there is no external confinement in the layer plane itself , but this is not essential and can be easily included .",
    "of course , it implies that the center of mass motion of the total system must be treated separately .    to solve the @xmath1-body problem",
    ", we follow the strategy outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite of approximating the interaction terms in the hamiltonian by quadratic forms for which the problem can be analytically solved .",
    "using simplified models to describe the behavior of self - assembling systems that form complex structures has proven very successful @xcite in spite of the diverse origin of the physical interactions . for the interlayer potential in eq .  , the harmonic approach has proven very accurate in reproducing energy , spatial structure , and wave function @xcite .",
    "the real dipole potential is thus replaced by @xmath28 where @xmath29 , and the corresponding frequency ( which is denoted @xmath30 for attractive ) is @xmath31 this procedure reduces all interlayer terms to harmonic oscillators that are carefully chosen to reproduce the two - body energies and the spatial structure of the state ( more concretely the node of the real potential in eq .   is reproduced ) .",
    "it is important to note here that we use the above description for the interaction of all pairs of molecules in different layers .",
    "this also includes the interaction of molecules in different chains and different layers .",
    "the spatial structure of the real dipole - dipole potential , eq .  , has attractive short - range and repulsive long - range parts .",
    "naively , this could mean that molecules in different chains would predominantly feel the long - range repulsive part of the potential .",
    "however , we note that this interaction supports a two - body bound state for any value of the dipole strength @xcite .",
    "this means that the attractive part of the potential is dominant in spite of the spatial profile , and allows one to use a model potential that is attractive such as the harmonic oscillator .",
    "of course , the strength of the oscillator should be adjusted such that when the dipole strength is weak , the harmonic potential is shallow and allows the wave function to spread out appropriately in space . as shown earlier , this procedure yields an accurate approximation for the two - body wave function that reproduces the energy and root - mean - square radius of the real dipole potential for @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the results presented here use @xmath33 .",
    "the interactions between molecules in different chains and different layers is thus included and will compete with the in - plane repulsive interaction described below .    the intralayer repulsion in eq .   can also be approximated by a harmonic oscillator term .",
    "however , it must be of the opposite sign compared to the interlayer term in order to describe a repulsive force , i.e. the term becomes @xmath34 the problem is now to relate @xmath35 to the properties of the repulsive intralayer dipole - dipole potential .",
    "this has been discussed at length in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the current work , we are interested in the qualitative influence that the intralayer terms will have when inducing an interaction between the chains in the system .",
    "we therefore use a parametric approach and consider different values of @xmath35 without paying much attention to what the physical value may be .",
    "however , the systems we consider are in the self - bound regime , where the attractive interlayer terms must overcome the intralayer repulsion .",
    "if we fix @xmath36 for given @xmath37 , then there will be a critical frequency , @xmath38 , beyond which the @xmath1-body harmonic hamiltonian will develop complex solutions .",
    "this is the signal of instability toward breaking of the chain system into smaller systems as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "here we consider extremal values ; @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "these choices will help determine what the effects of the chain - chain interaction is on thermodynamic observables within the harmonic approximation .",
    "it is then reasonable to expect that the real system will behave similarly in those limits at least on a qualitative level .",
    "the major point of the current works is thus to investigate how one can determine the role of chain structures in the system through thermodynamic measurements , specifically the changes expected due to quantum statistics and due to chain - chain interactions .    when we consider the thermodynamics of several chains below it is very important to notice that we solve the full @xmath1-body hamiltonian including all molecules in all layers",
    "this means that the chain structure indicated on fig .",
    "[ schematic ] is not assumed in the full hamiltonian .",
    "a different way to approach the problem would be to consider the chains as fundamental degrees of freedom . in the strong - coupling limit , an effective chain - chain interaction",
    "can then be produced in analogy to the bilayer case @xcite .",
    "scattering of chains could then be calculated and thermodynamics investigated with respect to this effective potential .",
    "however , it is less clear how to incorporate the quantum statistical identity of the particles in this approach .",
    "one could imagine that in the limit of very large @xmath37 where the chains are essentially rigid , even length chains will behave as bosons , while odd length ones will have fermionic nature .",
    "this interesting idea is a topic for future work . in this investigation",
    "we use the full hamiltonian and do the symmetrization explicitly in each layer .",
    "this means that we consider _ all _ particles in _ all _ layers as equal constituents in the hamiltonian , i.e. we do not _ a priory _ consider the chains indicated in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] as the degree of freedom .",
    "the use of the terms one- , two- , and three - chain systems thus refers explicitly to the number of particles per layer , and does not imply that our system consists of one , two , or three rigid chains that interact .",
    "we first consider the case of a single chain , which was the focus of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "since the geometry is layered and no tunneling is allowed , the single chain system is equivalent to a system of @xmath1 distinguishable particles . solving the harmonic @xmath1-body hamiltonian yields @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 is the spatial dimension , @xmath43 in the case of planes ) vibrational degrees of freedom since the center of mass separates .",
    "we denote the mode frequencies by @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "each of these modes will contribute a zero point energy , @xmath46 .",
    "this will be part of the overall ground state energy which is not our concern here as we focus on the thermal behavior for non - zero temperatures and will set the ground state energy to zero .",
    "the partition function in the canonical ensemble , @xmath47 , is @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the degeneracy of the @xmath1-body state of energy @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is the inverse temperature . for the vibrational spectrum of a single chain ,",
    "each mode is non - degenerate and the spectrum is equidistant .",
    "the partition function is therefore a geometric series and we have @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "eq .   is the partition function of one mode .",
    "a state with energy , @xmath50 , involves all the modes , and since the energy is in the exponent of eq .  , we merely need to take the product over all individual modes @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the total number of vibrational degrees of freedom in the system , which as mentioned before is @xmath56 when the center of mass has been factorized .",
    "as we will see below , in the case of multiple chains , the problem will factorize into a term related to single chain behavior , @xmath57 , and a term containing the chain - chain modes .",
    "the center of mass motion can easily be taken into account . in the case where there is no external confinement in the layers , we simply multiply by the well - known non - interacting translational partition function @xmath58^{\\mathcal{d}/2}v,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is",
    "the volume and @xmath3 is the dimension .",
    "the total partition function is @xmath60 .",
    "if , however , there is external confinement in terms of an in - plane quadratic field , the number of vibrational degrees of freedom is simply @xmath61 with @xmath42 frequencies that are exactly given by the external confinement frequency .",
    "the partition function can be computed simply from eq .  .",
    "if the system isotropic is and the center of mass separates , then eq .   can be simplified to @xmath62    notice that our description of the single chain includes _ all _ possible internal vibrational modes similar to the approach of ref .",
    "however , we fix the potential to reproduce physical two - body features of the interlayer dipole - dipole interaction , whereas ref .",
    "@xcite uses an expansion of the dipolar potential around the origin to second order .",
    "both approaches yield accurate results for energies of longer chains when compared to exact numerics @xcite .",
    "in order to explore the effect of the intralayer repulsion , we need to extend to at least two molecules per layer .",
    "the minimal model would thus be a two - chain system .",
    "ideally we would like to consider the thermodynamics for any number of chains .",
    "however , the requirements of quantum statistics makes this an extremely complicated problem to solve due to the computational effort involved in determining the degeneracy of the many - body states .",
    "fortunately , systems of ultracold molecules often have very low density , and in this case we expect the dynamics of a few chains to capture the leading correlations in the system .",
    "the reasons for considering both two _ and _ three chain systems is that the dipolar interaction is expected to induced a triangular crystal in the limit of very strong dipole moment @xcite .",
    "a precursor of this transition should be present in a three chain model .",
    "for high density , one would need a different starting point , typically mean - field theory .",
    "we concentrate on this low - density limit from now on and calculate the properties of two- and three - chain systems .",
    "when dealing with identical particles , one must take into account the appropriate symmetry requirements of the wave function of those particles .",
    "for identical fermions , the wave function should be antisymmetric , and for identical bosons , symmetric .",
    "the ground state of the harmonic solution is a symmetric gaussian wave function , which could thus be a good approximation to a bose system .",
    "once we consider excited states for use in the partition function , the problem is much tougher , especially for many particles , as most excitations will , at first glance , appear neither symmetric nor antisymmetric .",
    "however , as we discuss below , in the case of two chains , the required symmetrization can be done analytically . for",
    "three chains one must resort to a numerical determination of the partition function @xcite .      for two chains ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] ) , molecules in different layers can be treated as distinguishable particles , while quantum statistics are important for molecules in the same layer .",
    "the total partition function can be written as a product of the separable single - chain term of eq .   and an intralayer quantum statistically restricted term @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the boson / fermion intralayer part .",
    "from diagonalization of the @xmath1-body hamiltonian , we obtain @xmath65 @xcite frequencies , where @xmath66 is the number of layers , and the center of mass has been separated . out of these frequencies ,",
    "@xmath67 refer to the single chain modes .",
    "the remaining @xmath66 frequencies describe the intralayer repulsion @xcite .",
    "each of these @xmath66 frequencies refer to a particular mode in the diagonalizing coordinates .",
    "when one writes these new coordinates in terms of the original laboratory coordinates @xcite introduced above , one sees that they are in fact antisymmetric in the coordinates of the identical molecules in each layer , i.e. they correspond to traditional relative coordinates , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is a layer index .",
    "this immediately implies that exciting any one of these @xmath66 intralayer modes by an even number of quanta will produce a symmetric state under exchange of two particles in the layer , while an odd number of quanta produces an antisymmetric state . in turn , this can be used to construct the excitations that are allowed for given quantum statistics .",
    "bosons require a symmetric wave function under interchange in each plane . in two dimensions ,",
    "the relative in - plane wave function is characterized by two non - negative quantum number , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , an independent harmonic oscillator for each spatial coordinate .",
    "it is then clear that for bosonic molecules , a symmetric wave function can be achived if either both @xmath70 and @xmath71 are even or both are odd . in this case",
    "we therefore have @xmath72 for integer @xmath73 . for given @xmath74 ,",
    "the degeneracy of this state is @xmath75 ( remember that the state @xmath76 is non - degenerate ) .",
    "the partition function for bosons now becomes @xmath77 where the product runs over all layers , @xmath69 , while the sum runs to infinity .",
    "this expression can be written @xmath78 ^ 2}\\right ] .",
    "\\label{qdeg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      for fermions , we require antisymmetry with respect to particle exchange .",
    "this is achieved by enforcing that the total excitation in each direction is odd , i.e. @xmath79 for @xmath73 .",
    "the degeneracy can be counted in the same way as for bosons , but the requirement of an odd sum now yields @xmath80 .",
    "we have @xmath81 which becomes @xmath82 ^ 2}\\right ] .",
    "\\label{qf1st}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the symmetry considerations above can be straightforwardly extended to three dimensions .",
    "in addition , an in - plane external confinement potential given by a harmonic oscillator does not change anything",
    ". the center of mass mode will be symmetric in all coordinates so it merely modifies the separable part of the partition function as discussed above .",
    "thus , it does not modify the symmetry properties .    in the oscillator formalism",
    ", a constant can be added to the hamiltonian in order to achieve some desired property of the energy of the system .",
    "here we are interested in the behavior of the system as it is thermally excited , and not in the ground state energy .",
    "we therefore choose to set the zero of energy at the ground state level , which is of course non - zero in absolute terms due to zero - point contributions of all oscillator terms .          having obtained the partition function , @xmath83 , analytically in the case of two chains , thermodynamic observables can be calculated . in the canonical ensemble ,",
    "the most straightforward is the helmholtz free energy , @xmath84 , which is the characteristic thermodynamic function of the canonical partition function . in the case of distinguishable particles , we have @xmath85 where the sum is taken over all vibrational degrees of freedom in the system . if the system is isotropic , then the free energy is @xmath86 the energy , @xmath87 , the constant volume heat capacity , @xmath88 , and the entropy , @xmath89 , is easily obtained as well .",
    "the total partition function for indistinguishable particles is @xmath90",
    ". the partition function can thus be separated , and the above formulae can be applied , with the appropriate limits on the sums .",
    "the analytical results above for the partition function in the two - chain case can unfortunately not be extended to a larger number of chains . in this case",
    "one needs to return to the general partition function eq .   and compute this numerically . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , this can be done quite effectively in the harmonic approximation for both bosonic and fermionic particles .",
    "the three - chain case has been computed numerically in order to obtain @xmath64 from eq .   that goes along with @xmath57 to obtain eq .  .",
    "we now present the results for both two and three chain systems for different values @xmath91 and 20 , for @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and for layer numbers @xmath92 and 12 .",
    "these values of @xmath37 are both in the regime where the harmonic approximation to @xmath93 of eq .",
    "is extremely accurate .",
    "we first discuss helmholtz free energy and energy for two chains , omitting the case of three chains which is very similar .",
    "next we present the entropies for two and three chains , and finally we show the heat capacities . we specialize to also discuss the distinct low temperature behavior of the heat capacity where quantum statistics is most pronounced .      in fig .",
    "[ bfae ] , we plot the helmholtz free energy ( upper row ) and energy ( lower row ) for bosons ( left column ) and fermions ( right column ) for two - chain systems .",
    "an immediate striking difference between the two upper plots , is the behavior at zero temperature where bosons are smooth , whereas fermions have a kink .",
    "this is a consequence of the ground state degeneracy of the fermionic system and appears through the entropy term in @xmath94 .",
    "we will discuss this in more detail when we present entropies below . at slightly higher temperatures",
    ", @xmath84 agrees quite well for bosons and fermions , with fermions having lower overall values in all cases . in the case of @xmath40 ,",
    "the curves are considerably below the @xmath39 case .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the mode frequencies are lowered as @xmath35 grows @xcite , allowing easier thermal excitation of the system .",
    "we also note that changing the layer number from 6 to 12 induces only slight quantitative changes .",
    "the energies in the lower row of fig .",
    "[ bfae ] show the same tendencies as @xmath84 , and their close similarity attests to the fact that the entropy term is causing the differences in @xmath84 at low temperature .",
    "the entropies of boson ( left column ) and fermion ( right column ) two ( upper row ) and three ( lower row ) chain systems are shown in fig .",
    "[ bfs ] . for two fermionic chains",
    "we see that the entropy does _ not _ go to zero at zero temperature .",
    "this is caused by the fact that antisymmetry requires at least one quantum of excitation . for two - dimensional oscillators",
    "the first excited state is degenerate and this implies finite entropy at zero temperature . due to the factor of 2 inside the product in eq .  , the zero temperature contribution is @xmath95 , so the plot approaches @xmath96 for many layers ( recall that @xmath1 is the _ total _ number of particles , while @xmath66 is the number of layers , i.e. @xmath97 ) . for three chains ,",
    "the ground state is non - degenerate in two dimensions ( the oscillator has a non - degenerate ground state and a twice degenerate first excited state ) .",
    "thus the entropy goes to zero at zero temperature for three chains irrespective of quantum statistics .",
    "we notice that the entropy starts to increase at larger temperatures for bosons than for fermions , implying that the activation energy gap is larger for bosons .",
    "this will become more pronounced when we consider heat capacities below and we postpone the discussion .",
    "in general , we see that for larger @xmath35 , the entropy in general grows for all temperatures as the modes go down in energy as discussed above .",
    "again we observe that the quantum statistics does not seem to play much role as the left and right columns in fig .",
    "[ bfs ] are very similar .",
    "the derivatives of the heat capacity makes it very sensitive to changes in behavior due to various modes that become activated in the system .",
    "this can be seen for instance in second order phase transitions where the heat capacity will become singular at the critical temperature .",
    "as we discussed in the introduction , the heat capacity is now a measurable quantity in ultracold atomic gases @xcite .",
    "we therefore anticipate that similar measurements should be possible also for experiments with polar molecules in the near future .",
    "another good observable would be the compressibility of the system .",
    "the detailed balance between attractive and repulsive interactions should be visible there as well .    in fig .",
    "[ bfcv ] we show a plot similar to fig .  [ bfs ] for the heat capacities for the same temperature ranges employed in figs .",
    "[ bfae ] and [ bfs ] .",
    "overall , we note the high temperature behavior of all cases which approaches the equipartition value of @xmath98 characteristic of two - dimensional oscillators .",
    "another general feature is that for larger @xmath37 , the heat capacity decreases due to the larger cost of excitation in the system .",
    "when we compare fermions to bosons , we find that fermions in general approach the limit slightly slower for both two and three chain systems . there is a clear shoulder at low temperature which seems to be more pronounced for bosons , but appears at lower temperatures for the fermions .",
    "also , going from two to three chains seems to make the shoulder more pronounced .",
    "this feature is clearly associated with the larger value of @xmath35 , and also becomes more clear with increasing @xmath66 .",
    "this implies that measurements of the heat capacity can potentially yield information about the role that chain - chain interaction plays in a dipolar chains liquid .        in order to further investigate the interesting features at low temperature in the heat capacities , we show a plot where the range of temperature is zoomed in around the low temperature region in fig .",
    "[ bfcvzoom ] . here",
    "we see that there is striking differences between fermions and bosons , and between the two and three chain systems",
    ". not unexpectedly , the effects of intralayer repulsion is most pronounced at low temperatures .",
    "the clear shoulder seen for large @xmath35 and three fermions is the one we see at higher temperatures for bosons in fig .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that bosons have larger activation energies due to a gap in the low energy spectrum .",
    "for bosons one can not generate a totally symmetric state by promoting one molecule from the ground to the first excited state , since the wave function would then necessarily become antisymmetric .",
    "thus , the gap for bosons is twice the level spacing in the low - energy spectrum , whereas for fermions this is allowed and the gap is just the level spacing .",
    "this is true for the three chain systems as seen clearly in the lower row of fig .",
    "[ bfcvzoom ] . for two chains ,",
    "we find that the gap is always the same ( twice the level spacing ) for both kinds of molecules , and the stronger increase of @xmath99 for bosons at low temperature is due to a larger density of states @xcite .",
    "note also the difference for three fermions for the two different @xmath35 values , with the larger one giving a much smaller activation energy due to the lowering of the mode frequencies .",
    "it is interesting to note that the heat capacity grows with @xmath66 when @xmath39 , while the opposite is true for large @xmath35 .",
    "this is connected to the fact that in the former case , the longer chains have more ( degenerate ) modes to thermally excite , whereas in the latter case the repulsion is pushing all modes down toward zero but slower for longer chains where more attractive terms are present .",
    "this means that measurements of heat capacities for systems of different @xmath66 can help determine whether the repulsive intralayer interaction is important or not for given system density .      for comparison to experiment",
    "it is convenient to recall our units for dipolar strength and for temperature .",
    "here we use that 1 debye equals @xmath100 in si units .",
    "also we must remember that the dipole - dipole interaction in si units has a factor of @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the permittivity of vacuum .",
    "the dimensionless dipolar strength can be written as @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the atomic mass unit .",
    "similarly , the unit of temperature that we use can be expressed in the form @xmath105    the experiments most relevant to our setup are the ones being conducted at the moment at jila @xcite .",
    "the rotational and vibrational ground state molecules used are @xmath106k@xmath107rb which has a maximum dipole moment of @xmath108 debye .",
    "the experiment reported in ref .",
    "@xcite has studied chemical properties of a sample confined to a quasi - two - dimensional stack of about 23 layers and found profound effects due to the optical lattice potential on the loss rates .",
    "the dipoles are perpendicular to the planes and the applied field has a magnitude that induces a dipole moment of @xmath109 debye . with a lattice spacing of 532 nm , this amounts to @xmath110 for maximum dipole moment , while for the experiment cited it is roughly @xmath111 .",
    "our results are based on the strong - coupling harmonic approximation , and @xmath37 must therefore be large .",
    "the jila experiments are therefore not in the regime of validity of our approach .    to get a stronger dipole moment",
    ", nak molecules consisting of a sodium and a potassium atom can be used .",
    "they are predicted to have a maximum moment of about @xmath112 debye @xcite .",
    "this has the advantage that several isotopes of potassium are available for ultracold atomic experiments of both bosonic and fermionic character .",
    "assuming that @xmath113 nm , one could in principle reach values of @xmath114 which is within the region where we expect our approximations to hold .",
    "furthermore , the range of temperature shown in figs .",
    "[ bfae]-[bfcv ] above corresponds to 27 nk in this case .",
    "we thus expect that intralayer effects could be studied for system temperatures below about 270 nk .",
    "reaching this scale should not be difficult experimentally .",
    "the physics of dipolar chain systems in multilayered geometries holds great potential for realization of exotic few- and many - body physics that is hard to access in other setups .",
    "here we have considered the case of chains of dipolar molecules with dipole moment oriented perpendicular to the layer planes and studied the thermodynamics for both bosonic and fermionic molecules . in order to render the problem tractable , we approximate the real hamiltonian by a harmonic form with suitably chosen parameters that reproduce realistic two - body properties of dipolar systems .",
    "in contrast to previous studies of the dipolar chain liquid , we include the effect of interactions between the chains by introducing a repulsive harmonic term that parametrizes this effect .",
    "we have also explicitly taken care of the quantum statistical effects of having more than one molecule per layer . in the simplest non - trivial case , there are two chains in the system and for that we can determine the partition function and in turn all thermodynamic properties analytically within the harmonic approach . in the case of three chains , the degeneracies of the states could no longer be determined analytically and we resort to numerics .",
    "our findings indicate that heat capacity measurements for the system can probe the relative influence of excitation within single chains and the inter - chain dynamics . while we have only considered the two and three chain cases here , for a low density system we expect these to be the leading correlations in the system",
    ". a viable way to study our predictions could be through measurements at different densities .",
    "starting from very low density , we would expect that the single chain modes are more important and will dominate the thermodynamics .",
    "however , as the density is increased , one should start to see effects of the inter - chain modes . in the case where the repulsive intralayer interaction is very strong",
    "we find a softening of the modes of the system and thus an increase in the heat capacity that could be observable .",
    "another observable that we expect will be strongly influenced by inter - chain dynamics is the compressibility . in the limit of very large density , we expect our approach to become less accurate and mean - field theory is probably a better starting point .",
    "the melting of classical crystals including those with dipolar interactions have been studied several decades ago @xcite , and recently the corresponding quantum system in the case of a single layer with perpendicular dipoles was addressed @xcite .",
    "the interest is focused on the ability of dipolar systems to form a crystal akin to the wigner crystal of the two - dimensional electron gas @xcite .",
    "the results presented here suggest that in the multilayer case there can be an interesting competition between interlayer attractive interactions and the in - plane repulsion that could modify the crystallization .",
    "this is an interesting topic for future studies .",
    "another question that arises for a system consisting of dipolar chains is whether one can develop an effective description that considers the chains themselves as the basic constituents .",
    "this is conceivable in the limit of low temperatures where the occupancy of higher modes is small .",
    "the quantum statistics of the chain would then depend on whether it has an even ( bosonic ) or odd ( fermionic ) number of molecules . at first glance ,",
    "the former would constitute a ( repulsive ) bose gas , while the latter would correspond to a fermi liquid - like state .",
    "the effective interaction between these entities could help discern potential instabilities in the system , such as the roton instability for bosons or the density - wave instability for fermions . in the limit where the number of layers is large",
    "the two types of instability should merge .",
    "it would be interesting to try to come up with an analytical expression for the dynamics in this limit . here",
    "the harmonic approximation could be very useful .",
