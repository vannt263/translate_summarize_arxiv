    "an important way to understand the interactions among particles is via the study of scattering . in related experiments , the initial status of a scattering state",
    "is required to be precisely controlled .",
    "this is relatively easy for charged incident particles because their initial momentum can be tuned by adjusting the electromagnetic forces imposing on them . for neutral incident particles ,",
    "the initial momentum is in general difficult to control precisely .",
    "however , the recent progress in the technology of trapping neutral atoms via optical trap might open a new way for studying the scattering of neutral particles with precisely controllable initial status @xcite . in this paper a model of a device",
    "is proposed and related theoretical calculation is performed to show how the mentioned scattering is realized .",
    "it turns out that in this device , as we shall see , the collisions among particles occur regularly and repeatedly .",
    "thereby the effect of each individual collision can be accumulated .",
    "this would be helpful for the understanding of the very weak interactions among neutral atoms ( molecules ) .    traditionally , the scatterings would at most have two incident channels ( say , in the experiments with head - on colliders )",
    ". however , in the following device , three or more incident channels can be realized . as an example",
    ", a three - body scattering with three incident channels is chosen to be studied .",
    "this is a generalization of a previous work on a two - body scattering in a trap with two incident channels @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that , in the beginning , there are three narrow optical traps located at the three vertexes of a regular triangle , and each optical trap provides a harmonic confinement .",
    "the total potential is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 points from the origin to the @xmath2 vertexes , and @xmath3 is the mass of a particle .",
    "when the center of the triangle is placed at the origin , @xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "it is further assumed that each trap contains an atom in the ground state of a harmonic oscillator , the three atoms are identical bosons with spin zero , and @xmath6 is large enough so that the atoms are well localized initially . suddenly the three narrow traps are cancelled . instead ,",
    "a broader new trap located at the origin @xmath7 is created , @xmath8 .",
    "then , the system begins to evolve .",
    "the evolution is affected not only by @xmath9 but also by the atom - atom interaction @xmath10 . in",
    "what follows the details of the evolution is studied , three - body head - on collisions occurring repeatedly are found , and the effect of interaction is demonstrated .",
    "we shall use @xmath11 and @xmath12 as units of energy and length .",
    "the symmetrized and normalized initial state @xmath13 where @xmath14 implies a summation over the permutations @xmath15 , and @xmath16 . without loss of generality , @xmath17 is given lying along the z - axis , while the triangle is given lying on the x - z plane .",
    "for convenience , three sets of jacobi coordinates denoted by @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , respectively , are introduced .",
    "the coordinates of the @xmath21 set are defined as , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "the other two sets can be obtained from the @xmath18 set by cyclic permutations . in terms of the @xmath18 set ,",
    "we introduce the harmonic oscillator ( h.o . ) states @xmath25 as basis functions , where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , or @xmath28 .",
    "they are normalized eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath29 with the eigenenergy @xmath30 and with the angular momentum @xmath31 and its z - component @xmath32 , where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 when @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , respectively .",

    "their analytical expression can be found in @xcite . in general , the symmetrization would cause the appearance of all three set of coordinates .",
    "however , by using the t - m coefficients , eq .",
    "( [ e2_psii ] ) contains only the @xmath59set so as to facilitate greatly the calculation .",
    "incidentally , since @xmath60is symmetrized , @xmath31 ( included in @xmath38 ) of eq .",
    "( [ e2_psii ] ) must be even and therefore @xmath61 . in principle , the right side of eq .",
    "( [ e2_psii ] ) should contain infinite terms . however , the overlap between @xmath60 and higher h.o .",
    "states are very small .",
    "say , if , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 are all smaller than 12 and @xmath31 , @xmath40 , @xmath65 are all smaller than @xmath66 , with the parameters specified below , the overlap of the right side of eq .",
    "( [ e2_psii ] ) with itself is equal to @xmath67 .",
    "this implies that higher h.o .",
    "states can be safely ignored .",
    "the evolution is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath68 containing @xmath9  and the interaction .",
    "when the jacobi coordinates are used it can be separated as @xmath69 where @xmath70 describes the c.m .",
    "motion , and @xmath71 describes the internal motion .",
    "since the eigenstates of @xmath72 are well known , if the eigenstates of @xmath73 are also know , the evolution starting from any initial state can be understood . in",
    "what follows , the symmetrized eigenstates are obtained via a diagonalization of @xmath73 in a limited space . in this way , only approximate solutions can be obtained .",
    "then , we increase the dimension of the space until a better convergency is achieved .    when @xmath74 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ e4_psijmpq ] ) are used as basis functions ( where @xmath31 is restricted to be even as mentioned ) , the matrix elements of @xmath73  is    @xmath75\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath76  denotes the set @xmath77 , and the implication of @xmath78 is alike , @xmath79 to control the size of the space , a number @xmath80 is introduced and @xmath81 is required for all the basis functions .",
    "there are two choices to obtain symmetrized eigenstates of @xmath73 . in the first choice , the set @xmath82 is firstly symmetrized and orthonormalized before carrying on the diagonalization .",
    "however , this procedure is complicated .",
    "therefore we make the second choice , in which the set @xmath83 is simply used without symmetrization but with the requirement that @xmath31 must be even and all the basis functions satisfying @xmath81 are included without missing .",
    "this requirement assures that the space is close under permutations , and no basis functions that will contribute to the symmetrized eigenstates would be missed , unless they are too high to have @xmath84 .",
    "however , in this choice , a number of unphysical eigenstates with confused symmetry will emerge together with those with correct symmetry .",
    "therefore a discrimination is needed as shown below .",
    "let an eigenstate be denoted as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a serial number of the @xmath87series .",
    "expanding in terms of the basis functions , @xmath88 where the @xmath31 in @xmath38 must be even , and the coefficients @xmath89 can be directly known from the diagonalization of @xmath73 .",
    "if @xmath85 is correctly symmetrized , the coefficients would obey @xmath90 and @xmath91 in the summations of eqs .",
    "( [ e14_baeven ] ) and ( [ e15_baodd ] ) , @xmath31 ( in @xmath38 ) is restricted to be even . with the help of eqs .",
    "( [ e14_baeven ] ) and ( [ e15_baodd ] ) , the states with confused symmetry can be discriminated and dropped , and all the symmetrized eigenstates under the restriction caused by @xmath80 can be extracted without missing .",
    "they are one - to - one identical to those obtained via the first choice if the same @xmath80 are used . in what follows @xmath85 denotes only the symmetrized eigenstate , and the associated energy",
    "is denoted by @xmath92 .",
    "with the eigenstates it is straight forward to obtain the time - dependent solution of @xmath68  as @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 . obviously , eqs .",
    "( [ e16_psit ] ) to ( [ e18_psiinrrt ] ) give only an approximate solution because the set @xmath85 obtained via diagonalization each would deviate more or less from the corresponding exact eigenstate , and because only finite number of @xmath85 are used in the expansion . however , it is believed that , when the number of basis functions becomes larger and larger , the above @xmath98 would be closer and closer to the exact solution .",
    "the crucial point is the convergency . in this paper",
    "the interaction is assumed to be weak .",
    "it turns out that , in this case , the convergency is satisfying as shown below .",
    "we shall demonstrate that the evolution is a repeating 3-body collisions , and the effect of interaction will be also shown .",
    "for these purposes , we extract the following quantities from @xmath98 .",
    "\\(i ) the density @xmath99 where the integration covers all the degrees of freedom except @xmath100 . therefore @xmath101 obviously , @xmath102 is the probability density that the inter - distance is @xmath103 .",
    "\\(ii ) the density @xmath104 fulfilling @xmath105    \\(iii ) the density @xmath106 fulfilling @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the angle between @xmath55 and @xmath27 .",
    "\\(iv ) the density @xmath109 fulfilling @xmath110 .",
    "it was found that the c.m . is distributed very close to the origin",
    ", therefore @xmath27 is approximately proportional to @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , the behavior of the particle 3 can be roughly understood via @xmath109 .",
    "incidentally , the behaviors of all the particles are the same due to the symmetrization . the analytical expression of these densities are given in the appendix .    in order to have numerical results , as an example , the interaction is assumed to be a repulsive core as @xmath112 if @xmath113 , or zero if @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is a constant to be given .",
    "the other parameters are chosen as @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 . to show the initial localization of the particles , we define the one - body density of the initial state as @xmath119 .",
    "this density is plotted in fig.1 .",
    "starting from @xmath60 , the details of evolution are given as follows .",
    "@xmath104 , @xmath102 , and @xmath106 against @xmath120  in the earliest stage of evolution is plotted in fig2a to 2c . where @xmath121 is assumed , and @xmath122 is from @xmath123 to @xmath124 ( say , if @xmath125 , then @xmath120 is from @xmath123 to @xmath126 ) .",
    "when @xmath127 , the inter - distances among the particles are about @xmath128 as shown in fig.1 and 2b . when the evolution begins , the peaks of @xmath129 and @xmath130 move inward synchronously , while @xmath131 remains to peak at @xmath132 .",
    "it implies a contraction of the regular triangle .",
    "accordingly , the three particles rush towards the center leading to a 3-body head - on collision .",
    "when @xmath122 is close to @xmath133 , the inter - distances become much shorter , and @xmath131 becomes nearly uniform .",
    "it implies that the geometric character ( i.e. , the regular triangle ) will be spoiled when the particles are close to each other .",
    "after the first collision , the particles move outward .",
    "when @xmath134 , each particle will be close to the opposite end of its initial position as shown by the solid curve of fig.3a .",
    "where @xmath109 is given at the point @xmath135 and @xmath122 is given in the interval @xmath136 $ ] .",
    "the sharp peak of the solid curve demonstrates clearly that a particle arrives at the opposite end when @xmath137 . due to the symmetrization of the wave function ,",
    "this is also true for other two particles .",
    "then , the above process begins to reverse .",
    "when @xmath138 , the system recovers its initial status nearly .",
    "if the interaction is removed , the recovery is complete and the system will undergo an exact periodic motion with the period @xmath139 .",
    "the motion is characterized by the repeating head - on 3-body collisions .",
    "each occurs once within the interval @xmath140 .",
    "however , due to the interaction , the recovery is not exact .",
    "when the time goes on the effect of the weak interaction will accumulate and gradually emerge .",
    "this is shown by the dash - curve of fig.3a which describes the behavior of @xmath141 after @xmath142 rounds of head - on collisions . where the peak is lower than that of the solid curve .",
    "it implies that the density is diffusing .",
    "furthermore , the peak of the dash - curve has shifted a little right implying that the arrival is a little delayed .",
    "the diffusion and the delay will become more explicit when @xmath120 is larger as shown by the dash - dot - dot curve . when the interaction is attractive , the above repeating 3-body collisions remain , and the densities remain to be diffusing .",
    "however , instead of a delay , the peak will arrive at the end earlier as shown in fig.3b , where @xmath143 . due to the diffusion of the density",
    "as shown in fig.3 , the phenomenon of repeating 3-body collisions will become ambiguous when @xmath120 is sufficiently large .",
    "when @xmath115 is given at a number of values and @xmath27 is fixed at @xmath144 , @xmath109 against @xmath122 is plotted in fig.4 , in which @xmath122 varies in an interval close to @xmath145 . in this figure",
    "both the locations and the heights of the peaks depend on the strength @xmath115 . in general ,",
    "a larger @xmath146 will cause a stronger diffusion and therefore a shorter life of the phenomenon of clear repeating 3-body collisions , and a more positive ( negative ) @xmath115  will cause a larger shift of the peak to the right ( left ) .",
    "in addition to @xmath115 , the evolution depends also on the range of interaction .",
    "therefore , by observing the time - dependent densities , information on the interaction can be obtained .",
    "the accuracy of the above numerical results depends on @xmath80 , the number controlling the total number of basis functions . as an example",
    "the values of @xmath141 are listed in table 1 to show the dependence .",
    ".the values of @xmath109 with @xmath147 and with three choices of @xmath80 .",
    "the other parameters are the same as those for fig.2 [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the convergency shown in this table is satisfying .",
    "thus we conclude that the numerical results obtained by using @xmath118 are accurate enough in qualitative sense .",
    "a model of a device containing repeating 3-body collisions is proposed to study the weak interactions among neutral atoms and molecules .",
    "the advantage is twofold .",
    "( i ) the initial status can be precisely controlled .",
    "( ii ) the weak effect of the interaction can be accumulated and therefore easier to be detected .",
    "numerical results support that information on interaction can be thereby extracted .",
    "a crucial point in the device is the initial localization of the particles .",
    "if they are better localized ( by increasing @xmath6 ) and/or they are more separated from each other initially ( by increasing @xmath148 ) , the repeating 3-body collisions would become more explicit and be maintained longer .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath68 has a larger @xmath149 , the interval between two successive collisions ( @xmath150 ) becomes shorter , therefore the evolution would proceed swifter .",
    "although the three particles are assumed to be identical bosons , a generalization to fermions and/or distinguishable particles is straight forward . in principle",
    ", the above device could also be used to study the three - body forces if they exist .",
