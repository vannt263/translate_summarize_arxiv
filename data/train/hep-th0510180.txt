    "classical general relativity predicts that we can make black holes .",
    "if we have enough mass in a given region of space then we have a process of ` gravitational collapse ' ; the matter is squeezed towards an infinite curvature singularity at @xmath0 and the spacetime outside @xmath0 is described by the vacuum solution ( we are assuming 3 + 1 dimensions , no charge for the black hole ) ds^2=-(1 - 2mr)dt^2+(1 - 2mr)^-1 dr^2+r^2(d^2+^2d^2 ) [ one ] we use units such that @xmath1 .",
    "the surface @xmath2 is the ` horizon ' ; classically nothing can emerge from inside this region to the outside .",
    "a curious paradox emerges when we add in the ideas of quantum mechanics to this picture .",
    "quantum field theory tells us that the vacuum has fluctuations , which may be characterized by pairs of particles and anti - particles that are being continuously created and annihilated .",
    "hawking @xcite showed that when such a pair is created near the horizon of a black hole then one member of the pair can fall into the hole ( reducing its mass ) while the other member escapes to infinity , giving ` hawking radiation ' .",
    "eventually the black hole disappears , and we are left with this radiation . while energy has been conserved in the process , we have a problem .",
    "the radiation quanta were created from vacuum fluctuations near the horizon , and at this location there is no information in the geometry about what kind of matter made up the mass @xmath3 of the black hole .",
    "so the radiation quanta do not carry information about the initial matter which collapsed to make the hole .",
    "if @xmath4 is the state of the initial matter which underwent gravitational collapse , then we can not describe the final configuration of radiation by a state arising from a normal quantum mechanical evolution |_f",
    "= e^-iht|_i since otherwise we _",
    "could _ reconstruct the details of the initial matter by inverting the unitary evolution operator : |_i = e^iht|_f in fact hawking found that the outgoing and infalling members of the pair are in an entangled state , and when the black hole vanishes ( together with the members of the pairs that fell into the hole ) then the radiation quanta left outside are entangled with ` nothing ' ; i.e. they must be described not a pure state but by a density matrix .",
    "closely associated to this problem is the ` entropy puzzle ' .",
    "take a box of gas having an entropy @xmath5 and throw it into the black hole .",
    "have we decreased the entropy of the universe and violated the second law of thermodynamics ?",
    "the work of bekenstein @xcite and hawking @xcite shows that if we associate an entropy to the black hole equal to s_bek = a4 g [ twonew ] then the second law is saved ; the decrease in entropy of the matter in the universe is made up by the increase in the entropy of the black hole .",
    "but if we take ( [ twonew ] ) seriously as the entropy of the hole then statistical mechanics tells us that there should be @xmath6 states of the black hole for the same mass .",
    "can we see these states ?",
    "the metric ( [ one ] ) seems to be the unique one describing the endpoint of gravitational collapse ; no small deformations are allowed , a fact encoded in the colloquial statement ` black holes have no hair ' .",
    "the fact that we can not find the @xmath6 states of the hole is the ` entropy puzzle ' . to see why this is tied to the information puzzle consider burning a piece of coal .",
    "the coal disappears and radiation is left , but there is no ` information loss ' .",
    "the state of the coal can be seen by examining the piece of the coal ; a different piece of coal will have a different internal arrangement of atoms even though it might look similar at a coarse - grained level .",
    "the radiation leaves from the surface of the coal , so it can ` see ' the details of the internal structure of the coal .",
    "by contrast in the black hole the radiation leaves from the horizon , a region which is locally the _ vacuum_. the initial matter went to @xmath0 , which is separated by a macroscopic distance  the horizon radius from the place where the radiation is created .",
    "if the above hawking process were valid then we must make a big change in our ideas of quantum theory , replacing unitary evolution of pure states by a more general theory where the generic configuration is a density matrix .",
    "not surprisingly , considerable effort was put into looking for a flaw in the hawking computation .",
    "but the computation proved to be remarkably robust in its basic outline , and the ` black hole information paradox ' resisted all attempts at resolution for some thirty years .",
    "one may imagine that since we are using general relativity and quantum theory in the same problem , we must inevitably be led to the details of ` quantum gravity ' , which is a poorly understood subject .",
    "so perhaps there are many things that were not done correctly in the hawking derivation of radiation , and there might be no paradox .",
    "but we can not escape the problem so easily .",
    "the radiation is derived from the behavior of vacuum fluctuations at the horizon , where the geometry ( [ one ] ) is completely smooth ; the curvature length scale here is @xmath7 , the radius of the black hole , and can be made arbitrarily large by considering holes of larger and larger @xmath3 . when does quantum gravity become relevant ?",
    "with @xmath8 we can make a unit of length  the  planck length l_p=[gc^3]^~10 ^ -33   cm ( we have assumed 3 + 1 dimensions and put in the usual values of the fundamental constants . ) when the curvature length scale becomes of order @xmath9 then the concept of spacetime as a smooth manifold must surely break down in some way .",
    "but for a solar mass black hole the curvature length scale at the horizon is @xmath10 and for black holes like those at the centers of galaxies it is @xmath11 , the same order as the curvature here on earth .",
    "it thus appears that we need not know anything about quantum gravity , and the simple rules of ` quantum fields on curved space ' would be sufficient to see how vacuum fluctuations at the horizon evolve to become radiation .",
    "it is these rules that hawking used , and these lead to the information paradox .    despite the above argument suggesting that quantum gravity is not relevant , there have been numerous attempts to find fault with the hawking computation .",
    "many of these attempts try to use the fact that in the schwarzschild coordinate system used in ( [ one ] ) there is an infinite redshift between the horizon and infinity , so low energy quanta at infinity appear very energetic to a local observer at the horizon ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "but this infinite redshift just signals a breakdown of the schwarzschild coordinate system at the horizon , and a different set of coordinates  the kruskal coordinates cover both the exterior and the interior of the horizon and show no pathology at the horizon .",
    "so we need to understand the physics behind such approaches in further detail .",
    "my personal opinion on this count is that the hawking argument can be phrased in the following more precise way .",
    "suppose that we assume    ( a)all quantum gravity effects are confined to within a fixed length scale like the planck length or string length .",
    "( b)the vacuum is unique .",
    "then hawking radiation will occur in a way that will lead to the violation of quantum mechanics .",
    "the arguments for this phrasing will be given elsewhere .",
    "but accepting for the moment this version of the hawking argument we can ask which of the assumptions breaks down if quantum mechanics is to be valid .",
    "we will describe several computations in string theory that suggest that ( a ) is incorrect .",
    "how can this happen , if @xmath9 is the natural length scale made out of @xmath12 ?",
    "if we scatter two gravitons off each other , then quantum gravity effects would indeed become important only when the wavelength of the gravitons dropped to a microscopic length like the string length or planck length .",
    "but a large black hole is made of a large number of quanta @xmath13 .",
    "is the length scale of quantum gravity @xmath9 or is it @xmath14 for some @xmath15 .",
    "we will argue , using some computations in string theory , that the latter is true , and that the length scale @xmath14 is of order the horizon radius , a macroscopic length .",
    "this , if true , would alter the picture of the black hole interior completely .",
    "it would also remove the information paradox , since we will have a horizon sized ` fuzzball ' , instead of the metric ( [ one ] ) which is ` empty space ' near the horizon .",
    "radiation leaving from the surface of the ` fuzzball ' can carry the information contained in the fuzzball just as radiation leaving from the surface of a piece of coal carries information about the state of the coal .    in this review we will go over some of the basic understanding of black holes that has been obtained using string theory .",
    "we will see how to make black holes in string theory , and how to understand their entropy and hawking radiation .",
    "we will construct explicitly the interiors for 2-charge extremal holes .",
    "these will give us a ` fuzzball ' type interior conjectured above .",
    "we will then use qualitative arguments to suggest that all black holes have such a ` fuzzball ' description for the interior of their horizon .",
    "* note : * the goal of this review is to initiate the reader to some of the older work on black holes in string theory , and to show how it connects to some of the ideas developing now .",
    "we do not seek to actually review in any detail the current advances being made in the area .",
    "in particular we do not discuss 3-charge systems , in which considerable progress has been achieved over the past couple of years .",
    "we list some of these advances at the end of this article , with the hope that the reader will be inclined to delve further into the literature on the subject .",
    "for concreteness , let us start with type iia string theory .",
    "we must make our black hole from the objects in the theory .",
    "these objects are the following .",
    "first we have the massless graviton , present in any theory of gravity .",
    "we also have the elementary string , which we call an ns1 brane . among the higher branes",
    ", we have an ns5 brane , and d0,d2,d4,d6,d8 branes .",
    "we can also make kaluza - klein monopoles just using the gravitational field ; these look like branes extending in the directions transverse to the kk - monopole .    to make a black hole we would like to put a large mass at one location .",
    "let us start by using the elementary string , the ns1 .",
    "left to itself it will shrink and collapse to a massless quantum , so we compactify a direction to a circle @xmath16 and wrap the ns1 on this circle . to get a large mass we let the winding number be @xmath17 .",
    "it is important that we take a _ bound _ state of these @xmath18 strings , since otherwise we will end up making many small black holes instead of one big black hole .",
    "the bound state in this case is easily pictured : we let the string wrap around the circle @xmath18 times before joining back to form a closed loop ; thus we have one long ` multiwound ' string of total length @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the radius of the @xmath16 . the supergravity solution produced by such a string is ds^2_string&=&h_1 ^ -1[-dt^2+dy^2]+_i=1 ^ 8 dx_idx_i + e^2&=&h_1 ^ -1 + h_1&=&1+q_1r^6 here",
    "@xmath21 is the 10-d string metric , @xmath22 is the coordinate along the @xmath16 and @xmath23 are the 8 spatial directions transverse to the string . at @xmath24",
    "the dilaton @xmath25 goes to @xmath26 and the length of the @xmath22 circle is seen to go to zero .",
    "the geometry does not have a horizon at any nonzero @xmath27 , and if we say that the horizon occurs at @xmath0 then we find that the area of this horizon ( measured in the einstein metric ) is zero .",
    "thus we get @xmath28 .",
    "this vanishing of @xmath29 is actually consistent with the microscopic count .",
    "the ns1 brane is in an oscillator ground state , so its only degeneracy comes from the zero modes of the string , which give 128 bosonic and 128 fermionic states .",
    "thus we have @xmath30 $ ] which does not grow with @xmath18 .",
    "thus in the macroscopic limit @xmath31 we would write @xmath32 to leading order , which agrees with @xmath29 .",
    "let us go back and see why we failed to make a black hole with nonzero area .",
    "consider the ns1 brane as an m2 brane of m theory ; this m2 brane wraps the directions @xmath33 .",
    "a brane has tension along its worldvolume directions , so it squeezes the cycles on which it is wrapped .",
    "thus the length of the @xmath34 circle goes to zero at the brane location @xmath0 , which shows up as @xmath35 in the iia description .",
    "similarly , we get a vanishing of the length of the @xmath22 circle in the m theory description . on the other hand",
    "if we had some directions that are compact and transverse to a brane then they would tend to expand ; this happens because the flux radiated by the brane has energy and this energy is lower if the flux is spread over a larger volume .",
    "in computing the area of the horizon we can take two equivalent approaches :    \\(a ) we can just look at the d noncompact directions , and find the einstein metric ( after dimensional reduction ) for these noncompact directions .",
    "we compute the area @xmath36 in this metric and use the newton constant @xmath37 for @xmath38 dimensions to get @xmath39 .",
    "\\(b ) we can compute the area of the horizon in the full 11-d metric of m theory , and use the newton constant for 11-d to get @xmath40 . in the iia description",
    "we can compute the area of the horizon in the 10-d einstein metric and write @xmath41 .",
    "it is easy to check that the two computations give the same result .",
    "let us follow ( b ) .",
    "then we can see that the vanishing of the @xmath34 and @xmath22 circles in the above 1-charge solution will make the 11-d horizon area vanish , and give @xmath28 .      to avoid the shrinking of the direction @xmath34 we can take m5 branes and place them transverse to the direction @xmath34 ; this gives ns5 branes in the iia theory . to wrap the five spatial worldvolume directions of the ns5 branes we need more compact directions , so",
    "let us compactify a @xmath42 in addition to the @xmath16 and wrap the ns5 branes on this @xmath43 .",
    "we still have the ns1 branes along @xmath22 , but note that with the additional compactifications the power of @xmath27 occurring in @xmath44 changes .",
    "we get ds^2_string&=&h_1 ^ -1[-dt^2+dy^2]+h_5_i=1",
    "^ 4 dx_idx_i+_a=1 ^ 4 dz_adz_ae^2&=&h_5h_1h_1&=&1+q_1r^2 ,  h_5=1+q_5r^2 the @xmath42 is parametrized by @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 is proportional to @xmath47 , the number of ns5 branes .",
    "note that the dilaton stabilizes to a constant as @xmath24 ; this reflects the stabilization of the @xmath34 circle . note that the @xmath42 also has a finite volume at @xmath0 since the ns5 branes",
    "cause it to shrink ( their worldvolume is along the @xmath42 ) while the ns1 branes cause it to expand ( they are transverse to the @xmath42 ) .",
    "but the horizon area in the einstein metric is still zero ; this can be seen in the m theory description from the fact that the ns1 ( m2 ) and the ns5 ( m5 ) both wrap the @xmath22 circle and cause it to shrink to zero at @xmath0 .      to stabilize the @xmath22 circle we add _ momentum _ charge p along the @xmath22 circle .",
    "if we have @xmath48 units of momentum along @xmath22 then the energy of these modes is @xmath49 , so their energy is _ lower _ for larger @xmath20 .",
    "this contribution will therefore counterbalance the effect of the ns1 , ns5 branes for which the energies were linearly proportional to @xmath20 .",
    "we get ds^2_string&=&h_1 ^ -1[-dt^2+dy^2+k(dt+dy)^2]+h_5_i=1 ^ 4 dx_idx_i+_a=1 ^ 4 dz_adz_a + e^2&=&h_5h_1 + h_1&=&1+q_1r^2 ,  h_5=1+q_5r^2 ,  k = q_pr^2 [ tenp ]",
    "this metric has a horizon at @xmath0 .",
    "we will compute the area of this horizon in the 10-d string metric , and then convert it to the area in the einstein metric .",

    "this fact is crucial to the possibility of reproducing this entropy by some microscopic calculation . in the microscopic description",
    "we will have a bound state of the charges @xmath61 and we will be counting the degeneracy of this bound state .",
    "but since we are looking at bps states this degeneracy will not depend on the moduli .",
    "we have used three charges above : ns1 branes wrapped on @xmath16 , ns5 branes wrapped on @xmath43 , and momentum p along @xmath16 . if we do a t - duality in one of the directions of @xmath42 we do not change any of the charges , but reach type iib string theory .",

    "this entropy does not grow with the winding number @xmath18 of the string , so from a macroscopic perspective we get @xmath64 .",
    "let us now consider two charges , which we take to be ns1 and p ; by the above described dualities this is equivalent to taking any two charges from the set ns1-ns5-p or from the set d1-d5-p .",

    "it is important that we consider the _ bound _ state of all these charges .",
    "if we break up the charges into two separate bound states then we would be describing _ two _ black holes rather than the single black hole that we wish to consider .    for charges",
    "ns1-p it is easy to identify what states are bound .",
    "first we must join all the windings of the ns1 together to make a single string ; this ` long string ' loops @xmath18 times around @xmath16 before joining back to its starting point .",

    "let us now ask what happens if we add in the third charge , which will be ns5 branes if the first two charges are ns1-p .",
    "we will build a hand - waving picture for the 3-charge bound state which will be enough for our present purposes ; a more systematic derivation of these properties can however be given by using an ` orbifold cft ' to describe the bound state @xcite .",
    "suppose we have only one ns5 brane .",
    "since the ns1 brane lies along the ns5 and is bound to the ns5 , we can imagine that the ns1 can vibrate inside the plane of the the ns5 but not ` come out ' of that plane .",
    "the momentum p will still be carried by traveling waves along the ns1 , but now only four directions of vibration are allowed  the ones inside the ns5 and transverse to the ns1 .",
    "thus @xmath77 in ( [ entropythermal ] ) is 4 instead of 8 .",
    "the three charge bound state is supersymmetric , so we should have 4 fermionic excitation modes as well .",
    "then f_b+12 f_f=4 + 2=6 but the rest of the computation can be done as for the two charge case , and we find s_micro=2 since the three charges can be permuted among each other by duality , we expect a permutation symmetric result .",
    "since we have taken @xmath102 we can write s_micro=2 to understand the general case of @xmath103 we must get some understanding of why the winding number @xmath18 becomes effectively @xmath104 when we have @xmath47 5-branes in the system . to do this , recall that by dualities we have the map ns1 ( n_1 )   p ( n_p )    ns5 ( n_1 )   ns1 ( n_p ) so let us first look at ns1-p .",
    "suppose the ns1 wraps only _ once _ around the @xmath16 .",

    "now consider the ns5-ns1 system obtained after duality .",
    "if there is only one ns5 ( i.e. @xmath108 ) then we just have @xmath48 ns1 branes bound to it . noting how different states were obtained in the ns1-p picture we expect that we can count different states by partitioning this number @xmath48 in different ways .",
    "we can picture this by saying that the ns1 strings live in the ns5 , but can be joined up to make ` multiwound ' strings in different ways .",

    "if on the other hand we have many ns5 branes ( @xmath106 ) then duality indicates that the ns1 breaks up into ` fractional ' ns1 branes , so that there are @xmath99 strands in all .",
    "these latter strands can now be grouped together in various ways so that the number of possible states is given by partitions of @xmath99 _",
    "i m_i k_i = n_1n_p [ six ] in fact we should be able to reproduce the entropy ( [ smicro2 ] ) by counting such partitions .",
    "let us call each ` multiwound ' strand in the above sum a ` component string ' .",
    "the only other fact that we need to know about these component strings is that they have 4 fermion zero modes coming from left movers and 4 from right movers ; this can be established by a more detailed treatment of the bound states using the ` orbifold cft ' . upon quantization",
    "we get two ` raising operators ' and two ` lowering operators ' for each of the left and right sides . starting with a ground state ( annihilated by all lowering operators )",
    "we can choose to apply or not apply each of the 4 possible raising operators , so we get @xmath109 possible ground states of the component string . applying an even number of raising operators",
    "gives a bosonic state while applying an odd number gives a fermionic state .",
    "each component string ( with a given winding number @xmath66 ) has therefore 8 bosonic states and 8 fermionic states .",
    "the count of possible states of the ns5-ns1 system is now just like the count for the ns1-p system .",
    "if we partition the number @xmath99 as in ( [ six ] ) and there are 8 bosonic and 8 fermionic states for each member in a partition , then the total number of states @xmath101 will be given by ( following ( [ newmethod ] ) ) = 2 [ sixfollow ]    with this understanding , let us return to the 3-charge system we were studying .",
    "we have @xmath47 ns5 branes and @xmath18 ns1 branes .",
    "the bound state of these two kinds of branes will generate an ` effective string ' which has total winding number @xmath104 @xcite .",

    "then the number of component strings is m = n_1n_5k [ teight ] in the above set , one extreme case is where all component strings are singly wound k=1 ,  m = n_1n_5 [ eight ] the other extreme is where there is only one component string k = n_1n_5 ,  m=1 [ nine ]    let us now add the momentum charge @xmath68 to the system .",
    "we can take the ns1-ns5 bound state to be in any of the configurations ( [ seven ] ) , and the @xmath48 units of momentum can be distributed on the different component strings in an arbitrary way .",
    "all the states arising in this way will be microstates of the ns1-ns5-p system , and should be counted towards the entropy .",
    "but one can see that at least for small values of @xmath48 we get a larger contribution from the case where we have only a small number of component strings , each having a large @xmath98 . to see this",
    "let @xmath110 .",
    "first consider the extreme case ( [ eight ] ) .",
    "since each component string is singly wound ( @xmath111 ) there is no ` fractionation ' , and we just place one unit of momentum on any one of the component strings .",
    "further since all the component strings are alike ( we chose all component strings to have the same zero modes ) we do not get different states by exciting different component strings .",
    "instead we have a state of the form |=1[(component  string   1  excited )  +  ",
    "+  ( component  string   n_1n_5  excited ) ] the momentum mode can be in 4 bosonic states and 4 fermionic states , so we just get 8 states for the system .    now consider the other extreme ( [ nine ] ) .",
    "there is only one component string , but since it has winding @xmath112 the one unit of momentum becomes an excitation at level @xmath104 on the component string .",
    "the number of states is then given by partitioning this level into among different harmonics , and we get for the number of states ~e^2=e^2 where we have used @xmath113 since we have 4 bosons and 4 fermions .",
    "this is much larger than the number of states obtained for the case @xmath114 .",
    "the leading order entropy for ns1-ns5-p can be obtained by letting the ns1-ns5 be in the bound state ( [ nine ] ) and ignoring other possibilities .",
    "we put the @xmath48 units of momentum on this single long component string , getting an effective level of excitation @xmath115 and an entropy s_micro== 2 [ ten ]    we now observe that the microscopic entropy ( [ ten ] ) agrees exactly with the bekenstein entropy ( [ threeqp ] ) s_micro = s_bek [ agree1 ]    this is a remarkable result , first obtained by strominger and vafa @xcite for a slightly different system .",

    "but we will extract some general principles from the computations done above and then extrapolate them to the general nonextremal case .",
    "first , we have come across the idea of ` fractionation ' : when we put momentum modes on a string of winding number @xmath18 then this momentum comes in units of @xmath136 times the ` full ' momentum unit @xmath137 . similarly , ns1 branes bound to ns5 branes became ` fractional ' .",
    "second , we have observed that if we have large charges ns1-ns5 , then nonextremal excitations are carried by ( fractional ) @xmath127 pairs .",
    "if we have only large ns5 charge then the nonextremality is carried by a ( fractional ) ns1 living in the ns5 worldvolume .",
    "this effective string could have net winding and momentum around the @xmath16 , but consider for simplicity the case @xmath138 .",
    "then the ` effective string ' is a ` wiggling loop ' on the ns5 worldvolume , with no net winding or momentum . the loop can go up and down in the @xmath22 direction ( the direction of the @xmath16 ) .",
    "the part which goes up can be called a part of a winding mode , and the part which comes down can be called a part of an antiwinding mode . similarly , the ` wiggles ' on the string carry both positive and negative momentum along the @xmath16 .",
    "so very roughly we can say that the vibrations of the ` effective string ' exhibit @xmath127 as well as @xmath128 pairs .    thus in the general case of no large charges we expect that we will have @xmath127 pairs , @xmath128 pairs and @xmath139 pairs .",
    "further , each kind of brane will be ` fractionated ' by the other branes in the system , and the resulting degrees of freedom will give rise to the entropy of the hole .",
    "the geometry is characterized by the integer charges @xmath140 , the energy @xmath67 , and also three moduli : @xmath141 which arise from the volume of the @xmath42 , the length of the @xmath16 and the strength of the coupling . the entropy @xmath5 is a function of these 7 parameters .",

    "we have seen that duality permutes the three charges , and we note that ( [ nonexentropy ] ) is invariant under this permutation .",
    "it is also interesting that if we fix the energy @xmath67 ( [ energy ] ) and the charges @xmath144 and then require that the expression ( [ nonexentropy ] ) be maximized then we get the relations ( [ n1qq]),([n5qq]),([npqq ] ) .    while we have no good justification for ignoring the interactions between branes and antibranes the simple form of ( [ nonexentropy ] )",

    "the ns1 branes could move inside the ns5 branes ; calling the @xmath42 directions @xmath157 we find that the ns1 has allowed transverse vibrations in the four directions @xmath157 .",
    "this gives 4 bosonic degrees of freedom .",
    "there are also 4 fermionic degrees of freedom , but let us ignore these for now .",
    "if the transverse vibrations are all traveling waves moving in the same direction along the string then we have a bps state with some momentum p. if we have both right and left moving waves , then we have a nonextremal state , which can decay by emitting energy .",
    "the mechanism of this decay is simple : a left moving vibration and a right moving vibration collide and leave the brane system as a massless quantum of the bulk supergravity theory .",
    "conversely , a graviton incident on the brane bound state can convert its energy into left and right traveling waves on the string .",
    "this is of course just the same way that a guitar string emits and absorbs sound waves from the surrounding air .",

    "the 3-charge extremal hole is obtained for @xmath187 but @xmath188 . to go off extremality by a small amount we take @xmath125 small but nonzero .",

    "l(-2 ) 8g_5&=&(4g_5 ) ( 2 ) noting that 2s_micro = a_54g_5 we see that _ micro= a_5 using ( [ area ] ) in ( [ radiation ] )",
    "we find @xcite _ micro  =  _ hawking    thus we see that if we slightly excite the 3-charge extremal state then the radiation from the brane state has the same gross behavior as the hawking radiation from the corresponding near - extremal hole .      in studying the entropy of brane states we started with the case of three large charges and worked towards lesser charges .",
    "we follow the same approach here .",
    "let us now take the case studied in section([twol ] ) where we had two large charges ns1-ns5 plus a small amount of nonextremality .",
    "now @xmath48 is not large , rather @xmath149 should be thought of as being of the same order ( and much smaller than @xmath192 ) .",

    "such greybody factors are always expected to occur when the wavelength of the radiated wave becomes comparable to some length scale like the diameter of the radiating body .",
    "now look at the microscopic expression ( [ gmicro ] ) . substituting the values of @xmath194 we have _",
    "micro=  ( ^3 n_1n_5^4 g^2v ) using r_0 ^ 2 ^ 2n_1 ,  r_0 ^ 2 ^ 2n_5 we again find @xcite _ micro=_hawking    this is very interesting , because we have reproduced the greybody factors found in the classical computation ( [ greybody ] ) by a string theory calculation .",
    "the classical result had factors that correspond in the string computation to left moving and right moving particle densities .",
    "it is as if the classical geometry ` knew ' that there was an effective string description of the black hole .",
    "let us now consider the case where we have one large charge ( ns5 ) plus nonextremality . at leading order the absorption cross section for minimal scalars gives the absorption cross section @xmath195 ( eq . ( [ area ] ) ) and the emission rate is given by using ( [ radiation ] ) . on the microscopic side we saw that the states are accounted for by a fractional tension string vibrating in the plane of the ns5 branes",
    "we can compute the absorption by such a string , and we find @xcite _ micro = a which again implies @xmath196 .",
    "a similar result holds for the case of 3 + 1 noncompact dimensions when we have 2 large charges + nonextremality .",
    "we see that the degrees of freedom that of brane bound states that gave an entropy equalling the bekenstein entropy also give radiation that agrees with the hawking radiation from the corresponding holes .",
    "this is important , because it indicates that we have identified the correct physical degrees of freedom in the state .",
    "similar computations of absorption have been done for some other brane bound states ( see for example @xcite ) and agreement with the hawking rate obtained .",
    "we have seen that string theory gives us a count of microstates which agrees with the bekenstein entropy , and using the dynamics of weakly coupled branes we also correctly reproduce hawking radiation . but to solve the information problem we need to know what these microstates _ look _ like .",
    "we want to understand the structure of states in the coupling domain where we get the black hole .",
    "this is in contrast to a count at @xmath197 which can give us the correct _ number _ of states ( since bps states do not shift under changes of @xmath198 ) but will not tell us what the inside of a black hole looks like .    at this stage",
    "we already notice a puzzling fact .",
    "for the three charge case we found @xmath199 . but",
    "suppose we keep only two of the charges , setting say @xmath200 .",
    "then the bekenstein entropy @xmath29 becomes zero ; this is why we had to take three charges to get a good black hole .",
    "but the microscopic entropy for two charges ns1-p was @xmath201 , which is nonzero .",
    "one might say that the 2-charge case is just not a system that gives a good black hole , and should be disregarded in our investigation of black holes .",
    "but this would be strange , since on the microscopic side the entropy of the 2-charge system arose in a very similar way to that for the three charge system ; in each case we partitioned among harmonics the momentum on a string or ` effective string ' .",
    "we would therefore like to take a closer look at the gravity side of the problem for the case of two charges .",
    "we get the metric for ns1-p by setting to zero the @xmath46 charge in ( [ tenp ] ) . with a slight change of notation",
    "we write the metric as ( @xmath202 ) ds^2_string&=&h[-dudv+kdv^2]+_i=1 ^ 4 dx_idx_i+_a=1 ^ 4 dz_adz_a + b_uv&=&12[h-1 ] + e^2&=&h + h^-1&=&1+q_1r^2 ,  k = q_pr^2 [ naive ] we will call this metric the _ naive _ metric for ns1-p .",
    "this is because we will later argue that this metric is not produced by any configuration of ns1 , p charges .",
    "it is a solution of the low energy supergravity equations away from @xmath0 , but just because we can write such a solution does not mean that the singularity at @xmath0 will be an allowed one in the full string theory .",
    "what then are the singularities that _ are _ allowed ? if we start with flat space , then string theory tells us that excitations around flat space are described by configurations of various fundamental objects of the theory ; in particular , the fundamental string .",
    "we can wrap this string around a circle like the @xmath16 in our compactification .",
    "we have also seen that we can wrap this string @xmath18 times around the @xmath16 forming a bound state .",
    "for @xmath18 large this configuration will generate the solution which has only ns1 charge ds^2_string&=&h[-dudv]+_i=1 ^ 4 dx_idx_i+_a=1 ^ 4 dz_adz_a + b_uv&=&12[h-1 ] + e^2&=&h + h^-1&=&1+q_1r^2 [ f1 ] this solution is also singular at @xmath0 , but this is a singularity that we must accept since the geometry was generated by a source that exists in the theory .",
    "one may first take the limit @xmath203 and get the string wrapped @xmath18 times around @xmath16 in flat space .",
    "then we can increase @xmath198 to a nonzero value , noting that we can track the state under the change since it is a bps state .",
    "if @xmath18 is large and we are not too close to @xmath0 then ( [ f1 ] ) will be a good description of the solution corresponding to the bound state of @xmath18 units of ns1 charge .",
    "now let us ask what happens when we add p charge .",
    "we have already seen that in the bound state ns1-p the momentum p will be carried as traveling waves on the ` multiwound ' ns1 .",
    "here we come to the most critical point of our analysis : _ there are no longitudinal vibration modes of the fundamental string ns1_. thus all the momentum must be carried by transverse vibrations . but",
    "this means that the string must bend away from its central axis in order to carry the momentum , so it will not be confined to the location @xmath0 in the transverse space .",
    "we will shortly find the correct solutions for ns1-p , but we can already see that the solution ( [ naive ] ) may be incorrect since it requires the ns1-p source to be at a point @xmath0 in the transverse space .",
    "the ns1 string has many strands since it is multiwound .",
    "when carrying a generic traveling wave these strands will separate from each other .",
    "we have to find the metric created by these strands .",
    "consider the bosonic excitations , and for the moment restrict attention to the 4 that give bending in the noncompact directions @xmath23 .",
    "the wave carried by the ns1 is then described by a transverse displacement profile @xmath204 , where @xmath205 .",
    "the metric for a single strand of the string carrying such a wave is known @xcite ds^2_string&=&h[-dudv+kdv^2 + 2a_i dx_i dv]+_i=1 ^ 4 dx_idx_i+_a=1 ^ 4 dz_adz_ab_uv&=&12[h-1 ] ,  b_vi = ha_ie^2&=&hh^-1(x , y , t)&=&1+q_1|x - f(t - y)|^2k(x , y , t)&=&q_1|(t - y)|^2|x - f(t - y)|^2a_i(x , y , t)&=&-q_1f_i(t - y)|x - f(t - y)|^2 [ fpsingle ] now suppose that we have many strands of the ns1 string , carrying different vibration profiles @xmath206 . while the vibration profiles are different , the strands all carry momentum in the same direction @xmath22 . in this case",
    "the strands are mutually bps and the metric of all the strands can be obtained by superposing the harmonic functions arising in the solutions for the individual strands .",
    "thus we get ds^2_string&=&h[-dudv+kdv^2 + 2a_i dx_i dv]+_i=1 ^ 4 dx_idx_i+_a=1 ^ 4 dz_adz_a + b_uv&=&12[h-1 ] ,  b_vi = ha_i + e^2&=&h + h^-1(x , y , t)&=&1+_sq_1^(s)|x - f^(s)(t - y)|^2 + k(x , y , t)&=&_sq_1^(s)|^(s)(t - y)|^2|x - f^(s)(t - y)|^2 + a_i(x , y , t)&=&-_sq_1^(s)f^(s)_i(t - y)|x - f^(s)(t - y)|^2 [ fpmultiple ]    now consider the string that we actually have in our problem .",
    "we can open up the multiwound string by going to the @xmath18 fold cover of @xmath16 .",
    "then the string is described by the profile @xmath207 , with @xmath208 .",
    "the part of the string in the range @xmath209 gives one strand in the actual space , the part in the range @xmath210 gives another strand , and so on .",
    "these different strands do not lie on top of each other in general , so we have a many strand situation as in ( [ fpmultiple ] ) above . but note that the end of one strand is at the same position as the start of the next strand , so the strands are not completely independent of each other . in any case",
    "all strands are given once we give the profile function @xmath204 .",
    "the above solution has a sum over strands that looks difficult to carry out in practice .",
    "but now we note that there is a simplification in the ` black hole ' limit which is defined by n_1 , n_p [ fiftqq ] while the moduli like @xmath211 are held fixed .",
    "we have called this limit the black hole limit for the following reason .",
    "as we increase the number of quanta @xmath212 in a bound state , the system will in general change its behavior and properties . in the limit @xmath213 we expect that there will be a certain set of properties that will govern the system , and these are the properties that will be the universal ones that characterize large black holes ( assuming that the chosen charges do form a black hole ) .",
    "the total length of the ns1 multiwound string is @xmath214 .",
    "consider the gas of excitations considered in section([them ] ) .",
    "the energy of the typical excitation is e~t~l_t so that the generic quantum is in a harmonic k~ [ thir ] on the multiwound ns1 string .",
    "so the wavelength of the vibration is ~2rn_1~r [ fift ] the generic state of the string will be a complicated wavefunction arising from excitations of all the fourier modes of the string , so it will not be well described by a classical geometry .",
    "we will first take some limits to get good classical solutions , and use the results to estimate the ` size ' of the generic ` fuzzball ' .",
    "let us take a state where the typical wavenumber is much smaller than the value ( [ thir ] ) 1 then the wavelength of the vibrations is much longer than the length of the compactification circle = 2r n_1k=2r 2r where we have assumed that @xmath65 are of the same order .",
    "when executing its vibration the string will move in the transverse space across a coordinate distance x~||but the distance between neighboring strands of the string will be x=||(2r ) we thus see that ~  1    we can therefore look at the metric at points that are not too close to any one of the strands , but that are still in the general region occupied by the vibrating string |x - f(v)|x ( it turns out that after we dualize to ns1-ns5 the geometry is smooth at the location of the strands ; we will see this in an explicit example below , and for a generic discussion see @xcite . ) in this case neighboring strands give very similar contributions to the harmonic functions in ( [ fpmultiple ] ) , and we may replace the sum by an integral _ s=1^n_1 _ s=0^n_1 ds = _ y=0 ^",
    "2r n_1dsdy dy since the length of the compacification circle is @xmath215 we have = 12r also , since the vibration profile is a function of @xmath205 we can replace the integral over @xmath22 by an integral over @xmath216 .",
    "thus we have _",
    "s=1^n_1_v=0^l_t dv where l_t=2r n_1 [ fseven ] is the total range of the @xmath22 coordinate on the multiwound string .",

    "we depict the 2-charge ns1-ns5 microstate geometries in figure 2 .",
    "the most important point that we have seen in the above discussion is that in the ns1-p bound state the ns1 undergoes transverse vibrations that cause its strands to spread out over a nonzero range in the transverse @xmath256 space .",

    "we see that the metric settles down to the naive metric outside a certain ball shaped region @xmath258 .",
    "let us now ask an important question : what is the surface area of this ball ?",
    "first we compute the area in the 10-d string metric .",
    "note that the metric will settle down to the naive form ( [ naive ] ) quite rapidly as we go outside the region occupied by the vibrating string .",
    "the mean wavenumber is @xmath259 , so there are @xmath260 oscillations of the string .",
    "there is in general no correlation between the directions of oscillation in each wavelength , so the string makes @xmath260 randomly oriented traverses in the ball that we are investigating .",
    "this causes a strong cancellation of the leading moments like dipole , quadrupole ... etc .",
    "the surviving moments will be of very high order , an order that will increase with @xmath65 and which is thus infinite in the classical limit of large charges .",
    "we must therefore compute the area , in the naive metric ( [ naive ] ) , of the location @xmath261 . introduce polar coordinates on the 4-d transverse space dxdx = dr^2+r^2 d_3 ^ 2 at the location",
    "@xmath262 we get from the angular @xmath50 an area a_s^3~^32 [ tsix ] from the @xmath42 we get an area a_t^4~v from the @xmath16 we get a length l_y~ r ~ r thus the area of the 8-d surface bounding the region occupied by the string is given , in the string metric , by a^s~rv^32 the area in einstein metric will be a^e = a^se^-2 note that the dilaton @xmath25 becomes very negative at the surface of interest e^-2=h^-1~q_1 [ tfive ] we thus find a^e~rv^12~g^2^4 where we have used ( [ sixt ] ) .",
    "now we observe that ~~s_micro [ fftwo ] this is very interesting , since it shows that the surface area of our ` fuzzball ' region satisfies a bekenstein type relation @xcite .",
    "one of the key ideas we are pursuing is the following . to make a big black hole we will need to put together many elementary quanta .",
    "what is the size of the resulting bound state ?",
    "one possibility is that this size is always of order planck length @xmath9 or string length @xmath263 . in this case",
    "we will not be able to avoid the traditional picture of the black hole .",
    "since the horizon radius can be made arbitrarily large , the neighborhood of the horizon will be ` empty space ' and the matter making the black hole will sit in a small neighborhood of the singularity .",
    "but a second possibility is that the size of a bound state _ increases _ with the number of quanta in the bound state ~n^l_p [ ttwo ] where @xmath264 is the radius of the bound state , @xmath13 is some count of the number of quanta in the state , and the power @xmath70 depends on what quanta are being bound together .",
    "it would be very interesting if in every case we find that ~r_h [ tthree ] where @xmath265 is the radius of the horizon that we would find for the classical geometry which has the mass and charge carried by these @xmath13 quanta .",
    "for in that case we would find that we do not get the traditional black hole ; rather we get a ` fuzzball ' which has a size of order the horizon size .",
    "since we do not get a traditional horizon we do not have the usual computation of hawking radiation which gives information loss .",
    "the different configurations of the fuzzball will correspond to the @xmath6 states expected from the bekenstein entropy .",
    "for the 1-charge system we saw that the bekenstein entropy was @xmath28 . we also find no nontrivial size for the bound state , so the size remains order @xmath9 or @xmath263 , with the exact scale depending perhaps on the choice of probe .",
    "this is consistent with the picture we are seeking , but not a nontrivial illustration of the conjecture .",
    "but the situation was much more interesting when we moved to the 2-charge case .",
    "the microscopic entropy was @xmath266 .",
    "the size of the bound state was such that the area of the boundary satisfied a bekenstein type relation .",
    "we had verified this relation using the 10-d metric , but we can also write it in terms of quantities in the dimensionally reduced 5-d theory ~ [ tone ] we define the 5-d planck length by l_p^(5)g_5 ^ 13 we also define the radius of the horizon from the area = [ a_52 ^ 2]^13 the result ( [ tone ] ) then translates to ~(n_1n_p)^16 l^(5)_p [ tfour ] thus for the 2-charge system we find a manifestation of the conjectured relations ( [ ttwo ] ) , ( [ tthree ] ) .",
    "while we see from ( [ tfour ] ) that the fuzzball size @xmath264 is much larger then planck length @xmath9 , we have not yet compared @xmath264 to the string length @xmath263 . from ( [ tsix ] )",
    "we see that ~~l_s [ tseven ] one might think that this indicates that the fuzzball is really small in some sense ; it has just the natural minimum radius set by string theory .",
    "but such is not the case . in the ns1-p system that we are looking at @xmath267",
    "becomes very small at the fuzzball surface .",
    "thus the string tension becomes very low in planck units ; in other words , the string becomes very long and ` floppy ' .",
    "thus we should interpret ( [ tseven ] ) as telling us that string length is very large , not that @xmath264 is very small .",
    "this may sound more a matter of language rather than physics , but we can make it more precise by looking at the ns1-ns5 system which is obtained from ns1-p by dualities .",
    "it is a general result that the area of a surface @xmath268 ( measured in planck units ) does not change upon dualities . to see this , note that the einstein action in d spacetime dimensions scales with the metric as follows s~1g_dd^d x r ~[g_ab]^d-22g_d [ ssone ]",
    "this action must remain unchanged under s , t dualities .",
    "the hypersurface at fixed @xmath27 is @xmath269 dimensional . under dualities the @xmath269 dimensional area scales as @xmath270^{d-2\\over 2}$ ] .",
    "we have @xmath271 . from the invariance of ( [ ssone ] )",
    "we see that under dualities the scalings are such that the area of the @xmath269 dimensional fuzzball boundary measured in d - dimensional planck units remains invariant .",
    "this fact remains true whether we use a 10-d description or the dimensionally reduced 5-d one .",
    "for the fuzzball boundary in the ns1-ns5 system we get = a_54 g_5~ ( we have re - labeled the charges as @xmath272 to give them their appropriate names in the ns1-ns5 geometry . ) thus _ ns1-ns5~(n_1n_5)^16 l_p^(5 ) but this time the dilaton does not become strongly negative near the fuzzball boundary ; rather it remains order unity e^-2~n_1g^2^2n_5v to find @xmath264 in terms of string length and other moduli we write the 10-d area - entropy relation ~r_ns1-ns5 ^ 3 v rg^2^4 ~ to get _ ns1-ns5~[g^2^4vr]^13 ( n_1n_5)^16 we thus see that @xmath9 and @xmath263 are of the same order ( their ratio does not depend on @xmath192 ) while @xmath264 grows much larger than these lengths as the number of quanta in the bound state is increased .",
    "thus we see that comparing the bound state size to the string length is not a duality invariant notion , while comparing it to the 5-d planck length is . in planck units",
    "the bound state size grows with charges . in string units",
    ", it also grows with charges in the ns1-ns5 duality frame , while it remains @xmath263 in the ns1-p duality frame .",
    "the latter fact can be traced to the very small value of @xmath267 at the fuzzball boundary , which makes the local string length very large in this case .",
    "sen @xcite looked at the naive geometry of ns1-p , and noticed that the curvature of the string metric became string scale at @xmath273 , the same location that we have found in ( [ ffone ] ) as the boundary of the fuzzball .",
    "he then argued that one should place a ` stretched horizon ' at this location , and then observed that the area of this horizon gave the bekenstein relation ( [ fftwo ] ) .",
    "but if we look at the ns1-ns5 system that we obtain by dualities , then the curvature remains _ bounded and small _ as @xmath51 .",
    "the naive geometry is locally @xmath255 for small @xmath27 , and the curvature radii for the @xmath274 and the @xmath50 are @xmath275 .",
    "so it does not appear that the criterion used by sen can be applied in general to locate a ` stretched horizon ' .",
    "what we have seen on the other hand is that the naive geometry is not an accurate description for @xmath27 smaller than a certain value ; the interior of this region is different for different states , and the boundary of this region satisfies a bekenstein type relation ( [ fftwo ] ) .",
    "further , we get the same relation ( [ fftwo ] ) in all duality frames .    we have considered the compactification @xmath43 , but we could also have considered @xmath276 .",
    "suppose we further compactify a circle @xmath146 , thus getting a 2-charge geometry in 3 + 1 noncompact dimensions . in this case",
    "if we include higher derivative corrections in the action then the naive geometry develops a horizon , and the area of this horizon correctly reproduces the microscopic entropy @xcite .",
    "order of magnitude estimates suggest that a similar effect will happen for the 4 + 1 dimensional case that we have been working with .",
    "what are the _ actual _ geometries for say ns1-ns5 on @xmath276 ?",
    "recall that in the ns1-p system that we started with the ns1 string had 8 possible directions for transverse vibration .",
    "we have considered the vibrations in the noncompact directions @xmath23 ; a similar analysis can be carried out for those in the compact directions @xmath52 @xcite . but",
    "after dualizing to ns1-ns5 we note that the the solutions generated by the @xmath23 vibrations are constant on the compact @xmath42 , and we can replace the @xmath42 by @xmath277 while leaving the rest of the solution unchanged .",
    "( the vibrations along compact directions will be different in the @xmath42 and @xmath277 cases , but since we are only looking for estimate of the fuzzball size we ignore these states in the present discussion . ) in @xcite it was shown that the higher derivative terms do not affect the ` capped ' nature of the ` actual ' geometries .",
    "thus the k3 case is interesting in that it provides a microcosm of the entire black hole problem : there is a naive geometry that has a horizon , and we have ` actual ' geometries that have no horizons but that differ from each other inside a region of the size of the horizon",
    ". it would be interesting to understand the effect of higher derivative terms on the naive @xmath42 geometry .",
    "the 2-charge hole has two length scales .",
    "the radius of the horizon scales as @xmath278 where @xmath279 are the charges in any duality frame and @xmath9 is the 5-d planck length in that frame ( this scaling gives the bekenstein entropy from the horizon area ) . on the other hand the distortion of the metric due to charges reaches to a distance @xmath280 which scale as @xmath281 .",
    "thus for large @xmath212 ( the classical limit ) the horizon radius is much larger than the planck length ( which suggests that we have the physics of a black hole ) but the ` charge radius ' is even larger . for the 3-charge hole the radius of the horizon and the ` charge radius ' both scale as @xmath282 , so we can take a classical limit where both scales are visible in the classical geometry .",
    "it would be satisfying to see the same ` fuzzball ' ideas emerge for 3-charge microstates , since we would then be describing the kind of black hole that has been long studied by general relativists .",
    "we do not know how to make all microstates of the 3-charge hole , but some selected families have been constructed @xcite .",
    "all these geometries agree with the ` fuzzball ' notion since they have no horizons , but instead are ` capped ' at small @xmath27 .",
    "the constructed states are however not generic in that they have a large amount of rotation .",
    "several other constructions suggest that similar results will hold for generic states , in particular the work on supertubes and black rings which shows that black objects are not as unique as initially believed , and which suggests ways to construct three charge states @xcite .",
    "we have seen above that the 2-charge bound state has a size that grows with the charges ; further , the area of the boundary and the degeneracy of the state satisfy a bekenstein type relation @xmath283 .",
    "what causes the bound state to ` swell up ' in this fashion , and become much bigger than a fixed length like planck length or string length ?",
    "for 2-charge extremal states we constructed the states explicitly , and traced the size to the fact that momentum charge could only be carried on an ns1 by transverse vibrations of the ns1 . but we would like to have a more general understanding of the underlying physics , so that we can extrapolate the ideas here to more general black holes .    in this section",
    "we will use somewhat heuristic arguments to arrive at a picture of bound states in string theory .",
    "the discussion of this section is based on @xcite .",
    "the key idea will be ` fractionation ' , which we encountered already when studying momentum waves on a string .",
    "if we have a graviton on a circle of radius @xmath20 then its energy and momentum will be @xmath284 with @xmath285 an integer .",
    "if on the other hand we have a string wound @xmath134 times on this circle then binding the graviton to the string gives traveling waves , which have energy and momenta occurring in units @xmath286 .",
    "this ` fractionation ' of the momentum leads to a large degeneracy of possibilities when we distribute the momentum among the harmonics , so it leads to the large entropy of the system .",
    "does it also help us understand the large size ?",
    "at first it may appear that this effect is a rather simple and mundane one ; it would happen for any string in any theory , so it does not seem to have much to do with string theory or black holes .",
    "but in string theory we have dualities that map fractional momentum modes to ` fractional branes ' , which will have fractional tension @xmath287 .",
    "thus for large @xmath134 they can be very ` stretchable , floppy objects ' , and can thus extend far to give the bound state a large ` size ' . since the tension goes down with the number of quanta in the bound state , we may hope that the size of the state might always keep up with the horizon radius , however big a black hole we may try to make . in that case we will not have the usual black holes , but ` fuzzballs ' .",
    "we will now use the computations done in earlier sections to offer some justification for the above picture of bound states .",
    "we will argue that fractional branes must exist , that they can be expected to stretch out to macroscopic distances , and that this distance will be of order the horizon radius for the 3-charge extremal black hole that we had constructed .",
    "we have seen that the three charges ns5,ns1,p can be permuted by dualities .",
    "consider a 2-charge system , and let these charges be ns1,p .",
    "the extremal state is given by a ns1 wound @xmath18 times around the @xmath16 parametrized by @xmath22 , with @xmath48 units of momentum running along the positive @xmath22 direction .",
    "the entropy of this extremal state is s_ex=2 now consider adding some energy @xmath135 to this system so that it becomes slightly non - extremal .",
    "where does this extra energy go ? one might think that it goes towards creating extra vibrations of the ns1 .",
    "since we add no net momentum we must have n_pn_p+r e2 ,  |n_p = re2 which implies an entropy s_ns1-p+p|p=2[+ ] the subscript on the entropy tells us that the system is ns1-p and that it has been assumed that the additional energy has gone to creating @xmath127 pairs :  +  e   ns1  p  +   ( p  |p ) [ pp ]    let us also write down the expected emission rate from this near - extremal system .",
    "the @xmath127 vibrations can collide and leave the string as massless bulk quanta .",
    "let us look at the bulk mode we considered before ",
    "the component @xmath288 of the metric , where @xmath289 are directions in the @xmath42 . in section([twol2 ] ) we had computed the emission from vibrations on the effective string of the ns1-ns5 bound state , but the computation applies equally well to the ns1 string that we have here .",

    "the charges are also related by dualities n_1=n_p ,  n_5=n_1 but the radiation rate @xmath155 should be invariant under the dualities .",

    "thus the functional forms of ( [ em1 ] ) and ( [ em2 ] ) are not the same .",
    "in fact there is another more basic difference between the two emission rates .",
    "recall that in the microscopic picture of the ns1-ns5 system the effective string can vibrate only in the plane of the ns5 , so at leading order we can absorb a graviton like @xmath288 ( which is a scalar in 4 + 1 d ) but not a graviton like @xmath295 where @xmath296 are two of the _ noncompact _ directions .",
    "@xmath295 _ is _ absorbed at higher order in @xmath190 , by exciting fermions in addition to the bosons on the effective string ; these fermions carry spin under the rotation group of the noncompact directions .",
    "this fact accords well with the gravity picture , where the fact that @xmath295 is a spin 2 particle in 4 + 1 d implies that it feels an angular momentum barrier and its cross section is suppressed by powers of @xmath190 .",
    "thus in both microscopic and gravity pictures , at leading order in @xmath190 only the @xmath297 with @xmath298 in the @xmath42 are absorbed .",

    "so something has gone wrong , ( [ em1 ] ) and ( [ em2 ] ) are _ not _ computations of emission in duality related processes .",

    "gave us correctly the near extremal entropy and the correct hawking radiation , so it is a model that we trust .",
    "we are then forced to accept the process ( [ ns1p ] ) by duality .",
    "it may be hard to visualize how pairs of @xmath301 can be created , or how they can interact to give rise to the emitted radiation , but since we have arrived at ( [ ns1p ] ) by duality we will investigate the energy scales involved and see what we can learn . adopting ( [ ns1p ] )",
    "certainly removes the puzzle we faced above .",
    "the number of @xmath302 and @xmath303 will be equal in ( [ ns1p ] ) ( there is no net ns5 charge ) , so the left and right temperatures will be equal , as was the case in the near extremal ns1-ns5 case .",
    "we do not have a simple model like ( [ inter ] ) to give the decay of @xmath304 pairs to gravitons , but duality assures us that the correct spins will be emitted , and we do not have the obvious contradiction that we faced with the excitations ( [ pp ] ) where all spins were emitted equally .",
    "what then is the role of ( [ pp ] ) ?",
    "it certainly looks a correct description for excitations of the weakly coupled string .",
    "the mass of the lightest possible @xmath127 pair is e^ns1p_p|p  = 2(e_p)1n_1  =  2(1r)1n_1 [ expp ] where @xmath305 is the energy of a momentum mode , the @xmath168 arises because we must create these modes in pairs so as to add no net p charge , and the factor @xmath136 is the ` fractionation ' , which will be crucially important since we are interested in the limit where all charges will be large .",
    "since we have one power of the charge in the denominator we will call this a case of ` single fractionation ' .    in the process ( [ ns1ns5 ] )",

    "which excitation will be preferred , ( [ expp ] ) or ( [ exns ] ) ?",
    "we may expect that the lighter excitation will generate more entropy for the same total energy and so will be the preferred excitation ; we will investigate the issue of entropy in more detail below .",
    "( [ exns ] ) has a factor @xmath307 , so ( [ expp ] ) is the lighter excitation for @xmath203 , which makes sense because this is the free string limit and the excitations should be just vibrations of the string .",
    "but ( [ exns ] ) has ` double fractionation ' while ( [ expp ] ) has only single fractionation , so for given @xmath198 and sufficiently large charges ( [ exns ] ) will be the lighter excitation .",
    "we will now see that _ whenever we are in the ` strong gravity ' domain ( where we make a black hole ) then ( [ exns ] ) will be the lighter excitation_.    we are looking at the ns1-p system .",
    "the ns1 string has to carry @xmath48 units of momentum .",
    "if the momentum is in low harmonics then the amplitude of vibration will be large and the string will spread over a large region ; if the momentum is in high harmonics then the string will have a small transverse spread . for the generic vibration mode the transverse spread @xmath308 was found in ( [ ffone ] ) , and we will use this value for the transverse size of the string state . on the other hand the gravitational field of the string is described by the quantities @xmath309 which occur in the metric as @xmath310 .",
    "we will say that the string strongly feels its own gravity if ( x)^2   q_1 ,  q_p [ strong ] so that the size of the string is smaller than the reach of the gravitational effects of both kinds of charges .",
    "since @xmath309 may be unequal , we want @xmath308 to be smaller than both these length scales , a requirement that we can encode by writing ( x)^2  q_1 q_pq_1+q_p using ( [ ffone ] ) , the values ( [ sixt ] ) for @xmath309 and noting that the mass @xmath3 of the string is m = n_1 r+n_pr we find that the condition that the string feels its own gravity ( rather than be a free string in flat space ) is   g^2^3vr n_1n_pm [ condition ] now consider the ratio of the two kinds of excitations that we wished to compare . in ( [ expp ] )",
    "we had excited only the momentum modes , but to be more precise we note that by t - duality the winding modes can be excited as well .",
    "the excitation levels of the string are in fact given by the relation ( [ massformula ] ) with @xmath311 .",
    "this gives 2 mm  =  4n_l  =  4n_r for the lowest excitation we set @xmath312 and find e^ns1p_vibrations  =  m  ~   1 m we then find  ~  rvmg^2^2 n_1n_p comparing with ( [ condition ] ) we find that whenever we are in the strong gravity regime ( [ strong ] ) we have  1 so that the fractional ns5 brane pairs are lighter than vibrations of the string .",
    "even though we have found that the fractional ns5 brane pairs may be lighter , this does not mean that they are the preferred excitation ; we have to check that exciting them creates more entropy for the same energy .",
    "entropy measures the log of the volume of phase space .",
    "so if we require  >  1 then ( after the system comes to equilibrium ) we will find that the energy of excitation is carried by the fractional 5-brane pairs in preference to vibrations of the string .    to understand the role of entropy in this story consider first the ns1-ns5 bound state discussed in section([extr2 ] ) ; the present system ns1-p is of course related to this by duality . in the ns1-ns5 system we had an effective string with total winding number @xmath104 .",
    "we could partition this effective string into ` component strings ' , where the component strings have winding numbers satisfying ( [ six ] ) .",
    "the different ways to make these partitions , together with the different possible fermion zero modes on the component strings , gives the 2-charge entropy ( [ sixfollow ] ) .",
    "but the generic component string in a generic 2-charge state has winding number @xmath313 ( we can see this by applying duality to ( [ thir ] ) ) , so it does _ not _ give the fractionation ( [ fullfrac ] ) for @xmath127 excitations .",
    "it is true that if we want to get the maximal possible entropy from the @xmath127 excitations then we should have the maximal possible fractionation ( [ fullfrac ] ) ; this partitions each momentum mode into @xmath104 pieces and the count of these partitions gives the entropy .",
    "but to get this maximal fractionation we have to join all the component strings into one single long component string with winding number @xmath104 , so we _ lose _ the ` 2-charge entropy ' that came from the different possible partitions of the winding number .",
    "if there is a very small excitation energy , giving very few @xmath127 pairs , then we would suffer a loss of entropy if we make the single long string ; on the other hand if there was a sufficient amount of @xmath127 excitation then it will be _ more _ profitable to lose the ` 2-charge entropy ' and make one single long component string , then _ gain _",
    "the entropy coming from the maximally fractionated @xmath127 pairs . since these pairs are the ` third charge ' in this problem , we call this latter entropy ` 3-charge entropy '",
    ". to summarize , once we cross a certain threshold of excitation energy the system prefers to rearrange its degrees of freedom so that the entropy is ` 3-charge ' rather then ` 2-charge ' : the entropy obtained from different ways of partitioning the ns1-ns5 effective string is ` sacrificed ' , and the single long string which results then generates a higher entropy by maximally partitioning the _ third _ charge p.    let us now return to our ns1-p system , and apply the above principles .",
    "all we need do is permute under duality the charges involved in the above story .",
    "let the excitation energy be @xmath135 .",

    "but if @xmath198 is large enough that the string strongly feels its own gravity , then there is an excitation that is lighter than the lowest vibration mode of the string : a ` maximally fractionated ' @xmath317 pair . but to make such a maximally fractionated pair possible the ns1-p string needs to be in a specific state , so we would need to lose ` 2-charge entropy ' .",
    "suppose we make the added energy @xmath135 large enough so that the horizon of the geometry ( [ fullmetric ] ) becomes larger than the radius of the 2-charge extremal ns1-p ` fuzzball ' .",
    "then ` maximal fractionation ' becomes entropically favored , and the excitation energy is carried by @xmath317 pairs .",
    "our computations of near extremal entropy and radiation ( sections ( [ them ] ) and ( [ abso ] ) ) were compared with the properties of the metric ( [ fullmetric ] ) . in this metric",

    "the 2-charge fuzzball radius @xmath308 grows as @xmath319 . in ( [ fullmetric ] )",
    "we have the ` charge radii ' @xmath320 and the nonextremality parameter @xmath315 , and the near extremal limit corresponds to @xmath321 .",

    ", we will still have @xmath324 in the classical limit .    _",
    "thus to understand the dynamics of a black hole like ( [ fullmetric ] ) with ns1-p charges we need to think of fractional @xmath325 pairs .",

    "this , we expect , depends on which entropy is higher , ( [ en21 ] ) or ( [ en22 ] ) . noting that ( [ en21 ] ) is dominated by the contribution @xmath314 we find that these entropies become comparable when @xcite e  ~   m_kk  ~   rvr^2g^2^4 [ energy2 ] for larger energies above extremality , or equivalently , when @xmath331 is smaller than the value given by the above relation , we will have the excitations ( [ ns1ns5p ] ) in preference to the excitations ( [ ns1ns5ppp ] ) .",
    "so again we see a ` phase transition ' where the microscopic degrees of freedom change character when a parameter ( @xmath331 ) is moved past a critical point .",

    "we find that as we increase the size of a circle in the spacetime we go from a black brane wrapping this circle to a black hole that does not fill the compact circle . in our microscopic computation above",
    "we found that if we increase the size of the circle @xmath146 then we go from an object which has kk monopole - pairs wrapping the circle to an object that does not make use of this circle in distributing its energy .",
    "it would be interesting to see if the length scales ( [ length1]),([length2 ] ) can be understood as a case of the gregory - laflamme type @xcite , by analyzing the microscopic entropy in terms of the energy and ` pressures ' created by the brane bound state @xcite .",
    "let us put together all that we have learnt to make an ambitious attempt : we will try to obtain a crude estimate of the ` size ' of the 3-charge extremal bound state .",
    "we have already constructed explicitly the 2-charge states , and found that their radius @xmath334 is not ` small ' , i.e. @xmath334 is not a fixed scale like planck length or string length , but a length that grows with the charges in the bound state in such a way that the surface area of a sphere at @xmath335 gives the bekenstein entropy of the 2-charge state .",
    "we do not know how to make the generic 3-charge state , but we will try to use the concepts of fractionation and the origin of black hole entropy to get some idea of the dynamics that could govern the ` size ' of the 3-charge state .",
    "we proceed in the following steps :    \\(a ) start with the compactification @xmath117 , and construct the ns1-ns5-p extremal bound state as before .",
    "let this bound state be placed with its center at @xmath0 . bring a test quantum to a location @xmath336 near the bound state . at what value of @xmath337",
    "will the test quantum directly ` feel ' the bound state ?",
    "if @xmath337 is very large then the test quantum will only feel the usual long range fields like the gravitational field produced by the bound state .",
    "but as we reduce @xmath337 there might be a critical value at which brane - antibrane pairs ` stretch out and touch ' the test quantum .",
    "if such a phenomenon were to occur , we would say that @xmath337 is a measure of the physical size of the 3-charge bound state .",
    "\\(b ) if brane - antibrane pairs have to be created to stretch out and affect the test quantum then we need energy to create such pairs .",
    "where can this energy come from ? we have deliberately made things as hard for ourselves as possible , by taking an extremal ns1-ns5-p bound state ; all the energy of this state is accounted for by the charges it carries , so there is nothing extra that can be used to produce the pairs .",
    "but the fact that we bring the test quantum to within a distance @xmath337 means that we have an energy @xmath338 above extremality in the combined system of bound state plus test quantum .",
    "( for the test quantum @xmath339 . )",
    "we set e=1r_d [ en3 ] note that we are hoping to get a macroscopic value for the length @xmath337 at the end of the computation , so this energy is very small .",
    "\\(c ) we do not have a good picture of what it means for branes ` to stretch out and touch ' the test quantum .",
    "so let us modify the problem somewhat .",
    "we put the bound state in a periodic box of length @xmath337 , and add the energy ( [ en3 ] ) to the system .",
    "if the resulting excitations do not feel the size of the box then we would say that the ` size ' of the bound state is much smaller than the box size @xmath337 . on the other hand",
    "if the excitation generates branes that wrap around the compact direction of the box then we would say that the bound state size is _ larger _",
    "than @xmath337 .    at this stage",
    "we have now brought the problem to a form that can be tackled by the tools that we have already developed .",
    "we have a compactification @xmath145 , with @xmath146 having radius @xmath337 .",
    "we have a state with three large charges ns1-ns5-p , and a small amount of nonextremality . from ( [ ns1ns5p ] )",
    "we see that we can use the nonextremal energy to create fractional @xmath340 pairs .",
    "these monopoles have the direction @xmath146 as the nontrivially fibered direction , so the produced pairs ` wrap ' around the circle of size @xmath337 and are thus certainly sensitive to the ` box size ' .",
    "the mass of a monopole grows with @xmath337 as @xmath341 , so one might think that such monopole pairs are hard to produce with the small energy ( [ en3 ] ) , but fractionation can make these pairs light , as we will soon see .",
    "\\(d ) one last step before we start computing .",
    "we want not only that the fractional @xmath340 pairs _ can _ be generated , we want that it should be likely that they _ are _ generated .",
    "concretely , we demand that using the energy ( [ en3 ] ) to generate the pairs should lead to an entropy increase @xmath342 . since entropy measures the volume of phase space",
    ", this would imply that  e so it is more likely than not that we create the pairs .",
    "thus we set on ourselves the requirement s=1",
    "\\(e ) since the key effect here will be fractionation , let us pause for a moment to consider the nature of fractionation that we expect .",
    "we have seen that the extremal 3-charge system has an entropy @xmath343 .",
    "this entropy comes because we can distribute the fractionated components of this bound state ( fractional momentum modes in the description that we had used ) in many ways , getting the entropy @xmath314 . on that other hand , if we _",
    "sacrifice _ this entropy to make a special state of the ns1-ns5-p system , then we can get the new excitation  kk monopoles  to be ` maximally fractionated ' in units @xmath344 . in the computation of section([sque ] ) the ` phase transition ' occurred when it was advantageous to give up the entropy @xmath314 and to gain instead the entropy of fractional @xmath332 pairs .    in the present case we are making a small perturbation to the 3-charge ns1-ns5-p extremal state",
    ", so we do not expect that there will be a complete rearrangement of the 3-charge state .",
    "rather , we expect that a small fraction @xmath235 of the excitations will ` bind together ' to make a special configuration , and the rest will exhibit the entropy of the 3-charge state . specifically",
    "s&=&s_3-charge  +  s_4-charge&=&[2]+[2 + 2 ] [ fullen ] where n_kk+|n_kk=2n_kk = em_kk [ nkk2 ] when the system comes to equilibrium the parameter @xmath235 will get set to the value that gives the maximum entropy . extremising ( [ fullen ] ) with respect to @xmath235",
    "we find that the optimal value of @xmath235 is given through = 4n_kk  4n_kk [ mukk ] where in writing the approximation we have noted that we expect @xmath345 at the end of the computation .",

( [ nkk2 ] ) ) , and then using ( [ en3]),([mkk ] ) we find ~1 which gives @xcite r_d~[g^2^3rv]^13 as the length scale to which the fractional kk monopoles extend .",
    "but the schwarzschild radius of the 3-charge extremal hole is r_s = [ g^2^3rv]^13 ( this is easily verified by using @xmath349 . ) the agreement of the numerical coefficient is just fortuitous , but it is interesting that even in our very crude estimate all the other parameters fall into their correct place and tell us that the size of the 3-charge extremal bound state is not small ; i.e. not a fixed scale like planck or string length , but something that grows with the charges , and in fact is of order the horizon radius .",
    "this tells us that nonperturbative string theory effects can correct the geometry in the entire interior of the hole , and not just within planck distance of the singularity .",
    "the arguments of this section have been rough , unlike the concrete computations that we presented in earlier sections .",
    "but note that these arguments used little more than the results that we had found in our more rigorous calculations . in the process",
    "we have uncovered phenomenon like fractionation , phase transitions , low tension fractional branes and large sized fuzzballs .",
    "note that even for the 2-charge extremal ns1-p system we can attribute the nontrivial size to ` fractionation ' .",
    "suppose we had a string with winding number @xmath18 .",
    "if we put on this string a wave with wavenumber an integral multiple of @xmath105 then all strands of the string move together , and there is no significant transverse size .",
    "but if we put the energy in a mode with fractional wavenumber , say @xmath350 , then we have seen that the strands separate and spread out over a large transverse region .",
    "all this suggests that we must use radically new concepts to study bound states of large numbers of quanta in string theory .",
    "thus string theory can offer a perspective on the information paradox that we could not have obtained by using our semiclassical notions of gravity .",
    "let us summarize the ideas that we have developed .",
    "gedanken experiments tell us that a black hole must have entropy @xmath351 . in string theory",
    "we can make extremal black holes and count their states from the properties of strings / branes ; the bps nature of these systems enables this count to be made in a weak coupling domain and then continued without change to the coupling where we expect black holes .",
    "interestingly , such computations work also for near extremal holes , presumably because the excitations are sufficiently ` dilute ' on the large system of branes that the interactions between excitations can be ignored to leading order . from the interaction of these excitations with the bulk modes we also found that the emission from near extremal bound states agreed with the low energy hawking radiation expected from the corresponding holes .",
    "all this did not resolve the information paradox ; for that we need an understanding of the _ structure _ of black hole states , not just their count or dynamics deduced from a weak coupling domain .",
    "for 2-charge extremal states we found that the bound states were not small , but were ` fuzzballs ' of ` horizon size ' .",
    "we wrote the family ( [ ttsix ] ) of classical geometries to describe these states , but in doing so we assumed that the string in the ns1-p picture was well described by a classical profile .",
    "in general we have an energy eigenstate of the string in a vibration mode , and there will be quantum fluctuations about the mean . these fluctuations do not change the size of the region over which the string spreads ; they just make the object ` fuzzy ' so we term it a ` fuzzball ' . for more details on quantum fluctuations and",
    "the classical limit see @xcite .",
    "there are additional corrections which in the ns1-ns5 picture come from d - string winding modes in the @xmath22 direction ; in @xcite it was shown that these produce bounded corrections and so do not change the ` fuzzball ' picture of the microstates .",
    "we have argued that a basic idea is ` fractionation ' : the property of objects in string theory that when they make supersymmetric bound states they break up into smaller ` bits ' .",
    "it is this breakup that leads to the large entropy of string states ( which agrees with the bekenstein entropy ) .",
    "we have suggested that this breakup also leads to the large ` size ' of bound states that gives ` fuzzballs ' instead of smooth geometries with horizons .",
    "we get low tension ` fractional branes ' which can easily stretch to large distances , and a rough analysis suggests that this distance will be of order the horizon length .",
    "if such is the case then we change the picture of the black hole interior : different microstates will be different states of the ` fuzzball ' and radiation leaving from the surface of the fuzzball can see the information encoded in the state just like the photons leaving a burning piece of coal see the state of the coal and so carry its information .",
    "this would therefore resolve the information paradox .",
    "what is the significance of the ` naive ' geometry ( like ( [ one ] ) ) that we can write down as a solution of the classical field equations ?",
    "it is tempting to think that this could be some kind of an ` average ' over the microstate geometries .",
    "but as in any quantum mechanical system our fuzzball must be in any _ one _ of its possible states , so what can such an average mean ?",
    "one situation where _ all _ the states will be involved is where we put the system on a euclidean time circle of length @xmath69 ; this gives thermal partition function in which all microstates run around the time circle .",
    "this partition function may be represented by a euclidean path integral .",
    "suppose that this path integral is dominated by a saddle point configuration .",
    "based on what we know about euclidean black holes we expect that this will be the ` cigar shaped ' euclidean solution which ends smoothly at the horizon and has no ` interior ' .",
    "we can now continue this geometry to the lorentzian section , getting the geometry ( [ one ] ) .",
    "this geometry has a horizon , but it does not have any direct significance as a geometry in our approach ; the actual lorentzian geometries were the ` fuzzballs ' which had no horizons .",
    "one may however be able use the geometry ( [ one ] ) to compute green s functions that give ensemble averages over the black hole states @xcite .",
    "it is plausible that the ideas arising in black holes extend to other situations where we have a large number of particles interacting strongly , as for example in the early universe .",
    "if we get long distance quantum effects in the cosmological setting then it may affect our understanding of the initial wavefunction of the universe , the horizon problem and the way we compute the vacuum energy density .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we have sought to review a few selected computations in string theory to bring out a certain perspective on black holes .",
    "the presented computations are a small fraction of the research results in the area , and we hope that they will encourage the reader to look deeper at the field .",
    "in particular recent progress has been quite rapid .",
    "there is a general way to construct all bps 3-charge geometries , though this set includes bound states as well as unbound ones @xcite .",
    "for some specific families of bound states dual geometries have been constructed @xcite .",
    "larger families of such geometries were found in @xcite .",
    "3-charge supertubes offer a microscopic approach to the problem , and geometries for these have been suggested @xcite .",
    "the discovery of black rings has provided another new aspect of the problem of ` hair ' for black holes ; one finds that black hole metrics are not as unique as originally believed @xcite .",
    "there is a way to add monopole charges to bps states , which gives possible microstates for 4-dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "work with generic members of the ensembles of microstates show that they might exhibit black hole like properties @xcite .",
    "some nonextremal state geometries have been constructed as well @xcite .",
    "this progress suggests that there is a vast body of knowledge remaining to be uncovered in this area .",
