    "in recent years , approximate characterizations of capacity regions of multi - user systems have gained more and more attention , with one of the most prominent examples being the characterization of the capacity of the gaussian interference channel to within one bit / s / hz in @xcite .",
    "one of the tools that arised in the context of capacity approximations and has been shown to be useful in many cases is the _ linear deterministic model _ introduced in @xcite @xcite . here",
    ", the channel is modeled as a deterministic mapping that operates on bit vectors and mimics the effect the physical channel and interfering signals have on the binary expansion of the transmitted symbols . basically , the effect of the channel is to erase a certain number of ingoing bits , while superposition of signals is given by the modulo addition . even though this model deemphasizes the effect of thermal noise , it is able to capture some important basic features of wireless systems , namely the superposition and broadcast properties of electromagnetic wave propagation . hence , in multi - user systems where interference is one of the most important limiting factors on system performance , the model can also be useful to devise effective coding and interference mitigation techniques .",
    "there are many examples where a linear deterministic analysis can be successfully carried over to coding schemes for the physical ( gaussian ) models or be used for approximative capacity or ( generalized ) degrees of freedom determination , see for example @xcite-@xcite .",
    "* contributions . * from a practical viewpoint , _ cellular systems _ are of major interest . generally , a cellular system consists of a set of base stations each communicating with a distinct set of ( mobile ) users .",
    "effective coding and interference mitigation schemes are still an active area of research .",
    "approximative models such as the linear deterministic approach might help to gain more insight into these problems . in @xcite , the capacity of a basic cellular setup , a multiple access interfering with a point to point link , has been determined for the linear deterministic model in the case of _ symmetric weak interference_. in this paper , we extend these results to the case of arbitrarily strong interference with respect to the achievable sum rate .",
    "furthermore , we use these results to lower bound the generalized degrees of freedom for the corresponding gaussian channel",

    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : systemmodel ] introduces the system model . in section [ sec :",
