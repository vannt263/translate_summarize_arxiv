    "<S> * in superconductors with unconventional pairing mechanisms , the energy gap in the excitation spectrum often has nodes , which allow quasiparticle excitations at low energies . in many cases , e.g. @xmath0-wave cuprate superconductors , the position and topology of nodes </S>",
    "<S> are imposed by the symmetry , and thus the presence of gapless excitations is protected against disorder . here </S>",
    "<S> we report on the observation of distinct changes in the gap structure of iron - pnictide superconductors with increasing impurity scattering . by the successive introduction of nonmagnetic point defects into bafe@xmath1(as@xmath2p@xmath3)@xmath1 crystals via electron irradiation </S>",
    "<S> , we find from the low - temperature penetration depth measurements that the nodal state changes to a nodeless state with fully gapped excitations . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , under further irradiation the gapped state evolves into another gapless state , providing bulk evidence of unconventional sign - changing @xmath4-wave superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates that the topology of the superconducting gap can be controlled by disorder , which is a strikingly unique feature of iron pnictides . </S>",
    "<S> *    when repulsive electron - electron interactions are strong , a sign change in the superconducting order parameter ( or the gap function ) often leads to some energy gain for electron pairing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the positions of the gap nodes in momentum @xmath5 space , at which the order parameter changes sign , are determined by the superconducting pairing interactions . in the high transition temperature ( @xmath6 ) cuprates , it has been established that the lines of nodes are located along @xmath7 , as expected in the @xmath8 symmetry of the order parameter @xcite . in iron pnictides , on the other hand , the multiband fermi surface structure leads to several candidates for the superconducting symmetry , including sign - changing @xmath9 with and without nodes , sign - preserving @xmath10 , @xmath0-wave and time - reversal symmetry breaking @xmath11 @xcite . different symmetries and details of higher order momentum dependence of the gap yield topologically different nodal structures , such as vertical or horizontal lines of nodes , nodal loops or no nodes .    </S>",
    "<S> the effects of nonmagnetic impurities on unconventional superconductivity has been one of the central issues in condensed matter physics @xcite . for the conventional bcs superconductors </S>",
    "<S> , it has been established that the effect is essentially null : the transition temperature is robust against nonmagnetic impurity scattering ( the so - called anderson theorem ) and so is the superconducting gap . </S>",
    "<S> for the unconventional superconductors , the important aspect of the impurity effects is to mix gaps on different parts of the fermi surface and thereby smear out the momentum dependence @xcite . in the case of superconducting gap with symmetry protected nodes such as @xmath0-wave </S>",
    "<S> , this averaging mechanism leads to the suppression of the gap amplitude , which enhances the low - lying quasiparticle excitations near the nodal positions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this , the sign change in the order parameter gives rise to impurity - induced andreev bound states , which lead to additional quasiparticle excitations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such pair - breaking effects of impurities have been observed , e.g. in zn - doped yba@xmath1cu@xmath12o@xmath13 in the bulk measurements of magnetic penetration depth , where the @xmath14-linear temperature dependence in the clean - limit @xmath0-wave superconductivity gradually changes to a @xmath15 dependence at low temperatures with increasing zn concentrations @xcite .    in sharp contrast , </S>",
    "<S> when the nodal positions are not symmetry protected , as in the nodal @xmath4-wave case , the averaging mechanism of impurity scattering can displace the nodes , and at a certain critical impurity concentration the nodes may be lifted if intraband scattering dominates @xcite , eliminating the low - energy quasiparticle excitations . in the fully gapped state after the node lifting , we have two cases in the multiband superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> if the signs of the order parameter on different bands are opposite , residual interband scattering can give rise to midgap andreev bound states localized at nonmagnetic impurities that can contribute to the low - energy excitations , provided that the concentration of impurities is enough to create such states . </S>",
    "<S> if there is no sign change , anderson s theorem will be recovered , no andreev states will be created , and thus no significant further change is expected . indeed </S>",
    "<S> such a difference between nodal sign - changing @xmath9 and sign - preserving @xmath10 cases has been theoretically suggested by the recent calculations for multiband superconductivity considering the band structure of iron pnictides @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the impurity effects on the gap nodes and low - energy excitations can be used as a powerful probe for the pairing symmetry of superconductors .     and incident energy @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> typical threshold energy @xmath17 for the displacement of fe atoms from the lattice is marked by thick orange line . </S>",
    "<S> 2.5mev electron irradiation used in this study ( red square ) has orders of magnitude smaller recoil energy than other particle irradiation owing to the small mass . </S>",

    "<S> columnar defects can be created by heavy - ion irradiation ( * b * ) . </S>",
    "<S> particle irradiation with relatively large recoil energies tends to have cascades of point defects due to successive collisions of atoms ( * c * ) . </S>",
    "<S> electron irradiation with a small recoil energy is the most reliable way to obtain uniform point defects ( * d * ) . ]    in this study , we focus on isovalently substituted system bafe@xmath1(as@xmath2p@xmath3)@xmath1 close to the optimum composition with @xmath19k @xcite . this system is particularly suitable for the study of the impurity effect on gap structure , because several experiments have indicated that the pristine crystals are very clean and exhibit nodes in the superconducting gap @xcite . to detect changes in the low - energy quasiparticle excitations </S>",
    "<S> , we measure the magnetic penetration depth @xmath20 at low temperatures , a fundamental property of superconductors whose @xmath14 dependence is directly related to the excited quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> the tunnel diode oscillators ( tdos ) in @xmath21he and dilution refrigerators operating at 13mhz are used to measure the temperature dependence of @xmath20 down to 0.4k and 80mk , respectively @xcite . to introduce the impurity scattering in a controllable way </S>",
    "<S> , we employ electron irradiation with the incident energy of 2.5mev , for which energy transfer from impinging electron to the lattice is above the threshold energy for the formation of vacancy - interstitial ( frenkel ) pairs that act as point defects . </S>",
    "<S> the long attenuation length and the small recoil energy due to the small mass of electrons is important to create uniformly distributed point defects over the entire crystal with the width of @xmath22 m ( figs.[irradiation]a - d ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the recoil energy is too large , one may expect creation of complex defects such as clusters and cascades of point defects and , in the extreme case , columnar tracks , which has been realized by heavy - ion irradiation @xcite ( figs.[irradiation]b and c ) . </S>",
    "<S> another advantage of electron irradiation is that , unlike chemical substitutions , the defects can be introduced without changing lattice constants , which is quite important as the gap structure may be sensitive to the lattice parameters in iron - based superconductors @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> the temperature dependence of @xmath34 depends directly on the residual density of states at the fermi level , and therefore changes with increasing scattering as follows : ( 1 ) @xmath14-linear , ( 2 ) @xmath15 , ( 3 ) exponential , and ( 4 ) @xmath15 ( fig.[theory]d ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is the overlap of the bound state in the last panel  not present in the @xmath10 case  with the fermi level that gives rise to the `` re - entrant '' final @xmath15 dependence of the penetration depth . </S>",
    "<S> thus the observed sequential changes of @xmath39 in this system are fully consistent with a sign changing @xmath4-wave superconducting gap of @xmath9 type .    </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrates that the gap topology and the low - energy excitations can be changed by controlling disorder . </S>",
    "<S> such an impurity effect is unprecedented among superconductors , highlighting a unique aspect of iron - based superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> our study also shows that the impurity effects on gap structure can provide phase information on the superconducting order parameter in bulk measurements , in contrast to other phase sensitive experiments @xcite , most of which require excellent surfaces or interfaces . </S>"
