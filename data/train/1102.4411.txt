    "communication networks are increasingly being taxed by the enormous demand for instantly available , streaming multimedia .",
    "ideally , we would like to maximize the reliability and data rate of a system while simultaneously minimizing the delay . yet , in the classical fixed blocklength setting , the reliability function of a code goes to zero as the rate approaches capacity even in the presence of feedback .",
    "this seems to imply that , close to capacity , it is impossible to keep delay low and reliability high .",
    "however , this lesson is partially an artifact of the block coding framework .",
    "the achievable tradeoff changes in a streaming setting where all bits do not need to be decoded by a fixed deadline , but rather , each individual bit must be recovered after a certain delay . in this",
    "setting , the reliability function measures how quickly the error probability on each bit estimate decays as a function of the delay .",
    "surprisingly , the achievable error exponent can be quite large at capacity if a noiseless feedback link is available and cleverly exploited @xcite .",
    "the distinguishing feature of these streaming architectures with feedback is the use of an ultra - reliable special codeword that is transmitted to notify the decoder when it is about to make an error . while this `` red alert '' codeword requires a significant fraction of the decoding space to attain its very large error exponent , the remaining `` standard '' codewords merely need their error probability to vanish in the blocklength .",
    "one question that seems intimately connected to the streaming delay - reliability tradeoff is how large the red alert error exponent can be made for a fixed blocklength codebook of a given rate . beyond this streaming motivation",
    ", the red alert problem is also connected to certain sensor network scenarios .",
    "for example , consider a setting where sensors must send regular updates to the basestation using as little power as possible , i.e. , using the standard codewords .",
    "if an anomaly is detected , the sensors are permitted to transmit at higher power in order to alert the basestation with high reliability , which corresponds to our red alert problem .",
    "prior work has characterized the red alert exponent for discrete memoryless channels ( dmcs ) @xcite . in this paper , we determine the red alert exponent for point - to - point additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channels that operate under block power constraints on both the regular and red alert messages .",
    "we derive matching upper and lower bounds on the red alert exponent with a focus on the resulting high - dimensional geometry of the decoding regions .",
    "our code construction can be viewed as a generalization of that used in the discrete case .",
    "previous studies on protecting a special message over a dmc have relied on some variant of the following code construction .",
    "first , designate the special codeword to be the repetition of a particular input symbol .",
    "then , generate a fixed composition codebook at the desired rate .",
    "this composition is chosen to place the `` standard '' codewords as far as possible from the special codeword ( as measured by the kullback - leibler ( kl ) divergence between induced output distributions ) while still allocating each codeword a decoding region large enough to ensure a vanishing probability of error . by construction ,",
    "the rest of the space is given to the special codeword .",
    "early work by kudryashov used this strategy to achieve very high error exponents in the bit error setting under an expected delay constraint @xcite .    in @xcite , borade , nakibolu , and zheng",
    "study `` bit''-wise and `` message''-wise unequal error protection ( uep ) problems and error exponents .",
    "the red alert problem is a message - wise uep problem in which one message is special and the remaining messages are standard . while @xcite focuses on general dmcs near capacity , lemma 1 of that paper develops a general sharp bound on the red alert exponent for dmcs at any rate below capacity ( both with and without feedback ) .",
    "specializing to the exponent achieved at capacity , let @xmath0 denote the input alphabet , @xmath1 the channel transition matrix , and @xmath2 the capacity - achieving output distribution of the dmc .",
    "then , the optimal red alert exponent at capacity is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the kl divergence .",
    "we also mention recent work by nakibolu _",
    "_ @xcite that considers the generalization where a strictly positive error exponent is required of the standard messages .    for the binary symmetric channel ( bsc )",
    ", the optimal red alert exponent has a simple and illustrative form .",
    "this exponent can be inferred from the general expression in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 1 ) or via a direct proof due to sahai and draper @xcite ( which appeared concurrently with the conference version @xcite of @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath5 denote the crossover probability of the bsc and @xmath6 the probability that a symbol in the codebook is a one .",
    "then , the optimal red alert exponent as a function of rate @xmath7 for the bsc is @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "csiszr studied a related problem where multiple special messages require higher reliability in @xcite .",
    "upper bounds for multiple special messages with different priority levels were also developed in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "borade and sanghavi examined the red alert problem from a coding theoretic perspective .",
    "as shown by wang @xcite , similar issues arise in certain sparse communication problems where the receiver must determine whether a codeword was sent or the transmitter was silent .",
    "the fundamental mechanism through which high red alert exponents are achieved is a binary hypothesis test . by designing the induced distributions at the output of the channel to be far apart as measured by kl divergence , we can distinguish whether the red alert or some standard codeword was sent .",
    "the test threshold is biased to minimize the probability of missed detection and is analyzed via an application of stein s lemma .",
    "this sort of biased hypothesis test occurs in numerous other communication settings with feedback , such as @xcite and , as mentioned earlier , these codes are also used as a component in streaming data systems ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "there is also a rich literature on the interplay between hypothesis testing and information theory , which we can not do justice to here ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "first , we mention some of our notational choices . we will use boldface lowercase letters to denote column vectors , @xmath12 to denote the all zeros vector , and @xmath13 to denote the all ones vector . throughout the paper , the @xmath14 function",
    "is taken to be the natural logarithm and rate is measured in nats instead of bits .",
    "we use @xmath15 to denote the euclidean norm of the vector @xmath16 .",
    "the transmitter has a _ message _ @xmath17 that it wants to convey to the receiver .",
    "one of the messages , @xmath18 , is a red alert message that will be afforded extra error protection .",
    "we assume the red alert message is chosen with some probability greater than @xmath19 and the remaining messages are chosen with equal probability .    the _ encoder _ @xmath20 maps the message @xmath21 into a length-@xmath22 real - valued codeword @xmath16 for transmission over the channel , @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 denote the codeword used for message @xmath21 and let @xmath25 denote the entire codebook , @xmath26 .",
    "the codebook must satisfy both an average block power constraint across codewords , @xmath27 in addition , the red alert codeword must satisfy a less stringent power constraint , @xmath28 for some @xmath29 . the _ rate _ of the codebook is @xmath30 nats per channel use .",
    "note that our codebook average power constraint ( [ e : avgpower ] ) is less strict that the usual block power constraint @xmath31 .",
    "our achievable scheme can be easily modified to meet this constraint using expurgation .",
    "furthermore , our red alert power constraint ( [ e : alertpower ] ) is less strict than a peak power constraint @xmath32  @xmath33 , where @xmath34 denotes the @xmath35th symbol of the red alert codeword .",
    "our scheme sets the red alert codeword to be @xmath36 , which naturally satisfies a peak power constraint .",
    "therefore , our main results hold under an average power constraint and peak power constraint as well .",
    "we omit the red alert codeword from the average block power constraint for the sake of simplicity .",
    "another possibility would be to consider only an average block power constraint over both the standard and red alert codeword .",
    "this would lead to two different tensions between maximizing the red alert exponent and maximizing the rate .",
    "the first would be the allocation of the decoding regions and the second would be the allocation of power based on the probability of a red alert message . by using two separate power constraints , we can state our results in a simpler form that does not depend on the red alert probability .",
    "the _ channel _ outputs the transmitted vector , corrupted by independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) gaussian noise : @xmath37 where @xmath38 for some noise variance @xmath39 .",
    "the signal observed by the receiver is sent into a _ decoder _ which produces an estimate @xmath40 of the transmitted message @xmath21 , @xmath41 .    we are concerned with three quantities , the _ probability of missed detection _ of the red alert message @xmath42 , the _ probability of false alarm _ @xmath43 , and the _ average probability of error _ of all other messages @xmath44 : @xmath45    we say that a _ red alert exponent _ of @xmath46 is achievable if for every @xmath47 and @xmath22 large enough , there exists a rate @xmath48 encoder and a decoder such that @xmath49    in other words , we would like the red alert codeword to have as large an error exponent as possible while keeping the other error probabilities small . the standard codewords do not need to have a positive error exponent",
    "of course , the rate must be lower than the awgn capacity , @xmath50 , where @xmath51      we now review some basic facts of high - dimensional geometry that will be useful in our analysis .",

    "the solid angle @xmath72 of an @xmath22-dimensional cone of half - angle @xmath70 is the fraction of surface area that it carves out of an @xmath22-dimensional sphere , @xmath73 note that the solid angle is the same for any sphere radius @xmath54 .",

    "in the binary case , the simplest characterization of the optimal codebook is a statistical one : the red alert codeword is the zero vector and the remaining codewords are of a constant composition . from one perspective , this can be visualized as placing the red alert codeword in the `` center '' of the space with the other codewords encircling it ( see figure [ f : topdown ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to choosing the red alert codeword to be the all zeros ( or all ones ) vector .",

    "the binary construction sets the red alert codeword to be one of the poles and chooses the remaining codewords on the furthest parallel that can support a codebook of rate @xmath48 .",
    "this perspective leads naturally to the right construction for the gaussian case .",
