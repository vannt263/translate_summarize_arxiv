    "it has been demonstrated that nanoelectromechanical ( nem ) resonators are very suitable for sensor technology . in particular , it has been shown that nem resonators can be employed to measure mass  @xcite and charge  @xcite with very high precision . in the case of mass measurement applications ,",
    "nem resonators are useful because of the combination of properties such as low mass density , high vibrational frequencies and low intrinsic losses .",
    "these features are present , e.g. , in carbon nanotube based resonators where vibrational frequencies of @xmath0  ghz and quality factors of  @xmath1 have been achieved  @xcite .",
    "i consider an underdamped oscillator whose eigenfrequency exhibits small fluctuations .",
    "the eigenfrequency noise , @xmath2 , leads to ( classical ) dephasing of the oscillator response .",
    "dephasing can be observed , e.g. , in a ring down experiment , where , for a given realization of @xmath2 , the oscillations of the oscillator coordinate , @xmath3 , are dephased with respect to the oscillator response in the absence of frequency noise .",
    "moreover , the average oscillator response , @xmath4 , decays at a rate which is larger than half the oscillator energy relaxation rate , @xmath5 .",
    "the effect of dephasing can be also observed in the power spectrum or absorption spectrum of the underdamped oscillator as broadening and even departure from the lorentzian absorption line  @xcite .",
    "this broadening is not a consequence of an increase of the mechanical losses .",
    "studying frequency noise in nanomechanical resonators is important not only to find cures for the spectral broadening in high quality factor nanoresonators  @xcite but also in the application of the latter as sensors ( e.g. , nem - based mass measurement applications )  @xcite .",
    "the eigenfrequency noise may have different origins .",
    "for instance , in an electrical read - out method of the nanobeam displacement , charge fluctuations in the nanoresonator cause frequency fluctuations due to capacitive coupling with gate electrodes  @xcite . also , random frequency modulation of a certain vibrational mode can result from parametric coupling with other modes , which are , e.g. , thermally driven  @xcite .    in the context of nem - based mass measurement experiments , particles enter and leave the resonator at random points and they also diffuse along the resonator  @xcite .",
    "since the eigenfrequency shift of a vibrational mode depends on the particle position , random mass - loading of particles has been usually perceived as a limiting factor to the precision of nem - based mass sensors .",
    "however , i show that higher order cumulants of the ( complex ) vibrational mode amplitude can be used to characterize the frequency noise process  @xcite and determine the particle parameters ( mass , diffusion coefficient , attachment and detachment rates . )    in order to quantify the effect of random mass - loading in the average response of nanomechanical resonators , i present a frequency noise model which describes the quasicontinuous type of frequency noise present in nem - based mass sensors .",
    "this model contains , previously studied , frequency noise models for particle diffusion  @xcite and discrete frequency jumps  @xcite as limiting cases .",

    "have recently realized cnt - based mass sensors where xe atoms and naphthalene molecules attach , detach and diffuse along a cnt nanoresonator  @xcite . in typical nem - based mass measurement experiments the incoming flux rate of particles",

    "ii , i describe the frequency noise model used to calculate the mode susceptibility and higher order cumulants of the complex vibrational amplitude . in sections",

    "the vibrational amplitude , @xmath3 , of certain eigenmode , which is weakly driven near resonance by a force @xmath7 , satisfies the following equation , @xmath8q = \\frac{f}{m}\\cos(\\omega_f t ) + \\frac{f_t(t)}{m } , \\label{eq : eom_1}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath5 are the bare resonance frequency , effective mass and energy relaxation rate of the driven mode , respectively .",
    "equation   also includes the eigenfrequency noise , @xmath2 , and the zero - mean additive thermal noise , @xmath11 .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath12 , @xmath13 ; where @xmath14 is the frequency detuning and @xmath15 is the frequency noise correlation time .",

    "the relative size between the quantities @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath13 and @xmath20 is arbitrary .",
    "if the above restrictions hold then we can use the rotating - wave - approximation ( rwa ) to study the dynamics of @xmath3 at frequencies @xmath21 .",

    "the frequency noise becomes correlated with the additive thermal noise process in the case that the former depends on the oscillator state ( backaction ) .",

    "the limit cases of slow [ @xmath55 and fast [ @xmath56 frequency noise have been discussed previously  @xcite .",

    "the eigenfrequency noise due to random mass - loading in nem resonators is quasicontinuous .",
    "it evolves in time either continuously , when particles diffuse along the nanoresonator , or discontinuously , when particles enter and leave the nanoresonator .",

    "the diffusion coefficient is determined by the coupling between the particle and the nanobeam vibrational modes ( phonon bath ) and by temperature .",
    "if the excited vibrational mode is of low order and weakly driven , the nanobeam temperature and the other ( not directly driven ) modes are not significantly affected by the external drive . hence , for underdamped vibrational modes ,",

    "these results agree with dephasing due to telegraph frequency noise , which is obtained in the limit @xmath116  @xcite .",

    "using a frequency noise model such as the one introduced in section ii , measurement of the cumulants of @xmath22 can provide enough information to characterize the dephasing process and determine the particle parameters .",
