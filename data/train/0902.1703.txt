    "the presence of large amounts of unseen matter in and around spiral galaxies , distributed differently from stars and gas , is well established primarily from optical and 21 cm rcs which do not show the expected keplerian fall - off at large radii but remain increasing , flat or gently decreasing over their entire observed range ( bosma 1981 , rubin 1980 ) .",

    "presently , there are about 50 spirals whose rcs can not be reproduced by a nfw halo + a stellar disk .",
