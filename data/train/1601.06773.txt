    "sn ia observations ( riess et al . 1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) confirmed that the observable universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion .",

    "the authors of ref . [ 3 ] confirmed that the violation of sec gives anti gravitational effect that provides an elegant description of transition of universe from deceleration zone to acceleration zone . in the literature ,",

    "after the big bang , the universe may have undergone so many phase transitions as its temperature cooled below some critical temperature as suggested by grand unified theories ( zeldovich et al .",

    "the symmetry of universe was broken spontaneously that rises some topologically - stable defects such as domain walls , strings and monopoles ( vilenkin 1981 , 1985 ) . among all the three cosmological structures , only strings give rise the density perturbations that leads the formation of galaxies .",
