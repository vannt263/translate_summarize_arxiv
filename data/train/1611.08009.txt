    "it is noticed that in above all the intermediate positions @xmath21 s have infinite extents , @xmath22 . from the considerations mentioned earlier in introduction , here",
    "the main concern is about the finite - extent coordinates .",
    "the finite - extent coordinates are quite known in physics .",
    "the most familiar ones are the angle variables of polar coordinates in 2d and 3d problems .",
    "the other example happens when the system is defined inside a finite volume , like a box or a sphere . as a definite example , let us consider a free particle on a circle of radius @xmath23 . defining the angle variable @xmath24 with @xmath25 ,",
    "we have @xmath26 leading to the eigen - functions and eigen - values as follow @xmath27 then the transition amplitude between two different positions is known to be @xmath28 the above can be expressed in terms of the 3rd jacobi theta function @xmath29 by which we have @xcite @xmath30 using the modular property of @xmath31 @xmath32 the transition amplitude recasts as @xcite @xmath33 in which the summand is easily recognized as the transition amplitude of a free particle experiencing the position difference @xmath34 during time @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "there is a nice interpretation for the sum as well .",
    "as the particle moves on the circle from @xmath36 to @xmath37 , it matters how many times it rounds the circle .",
    "the sum on @xmath9 , the so - called winding number , is responsible for taking into account the contributions from different rounds to the amplitude .",
    "so , nevertheless the coordinate @xmath38 has finite extent , practically the particle may travel long distances @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "in fact ( [ 11 ] ) may come to a form similar to ( [ 4 ] ) with only an extra summation .",
    "first let us present a time - sliced form of ( [ 11 ] ) @xcite : @xmath41\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is noticed that at @xmath42-th time - slice the winding number @xmath43 is introduced @xcite .",

    "above all the intermediate angles @xmath48 s are integrated over the whole real - line @xmath49 .",

    "the above example shows that it is insufficient to merely use finite - extent coordinates to be granted the non - trivial aspects .",
    "the key point about the above treatment of motion on circle is that the time - sliced form of the action appearing in the path - integral ( [ 12 ] ) is not invariant under the multi - round shifts @xmath54 with @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "it is noticed that the above shift is directly related to the different number of possible rounds on circle represented earlier by @xmath43 in ( [ 12 ] ) . reminding that the group space of u(1 ) is circle",
    ", we can express the main idea in a group theoretical language . defining the u(1 ) group element by @xmath57 , the action by the lagrangian ( [ 5 ] )",
    "can be expressed as @xcite @xmath58 in above , although the starting point is taken to be the group element @xmath59 , the lagrangian depends in fact on the algebra element @xmath38 .",
    "this observation for the group u(1 ) is general and holds for other groups as well @xcite .",
    "obviously the situation changes if the action would be invariant under the shift ( [ 15 ] ) , namely due to dependence on group elements @xmath60 s instead of the algebra elements @xmath50 s .",
    "interestingly , once the time parameter is assumed to be discrete the desired dependence is obtained . by taking time as @xmath61 for some finite value @xmath62 and integer @xmath9",
    ", the worldline looks like a chain or 1d lattice with spacing parameter @xmath62 . on the @xmath9-th site of this chain the angle @xmath63 is sitting .",
    "so at time step @xmath9 we have @xmath64 , by which the discrete - time version of action ( [ 16 ] ) is @xmath65 which obviously keeps invariance under the shift ( [ 15 ] ) .",
    "the phenomena observed here is partially in reverse direction of what has happened in lattice formulation of gauge theories .",
    "namely , once one tries to introduce gauge symmetry to the theory on lattice the algebra elements @xmath66 s are to be replaced by the group elements @xmath67 s in the action @xcite . here as we were going to keep the invariance under the shift ( [ 15 ] ) the natural solution appears to be defining the action on discrete - time worldline . in the next sections we will use this as a basis for model building .",
    "before to end this section it is helpful to discuss the prominent role of the imaginary time in the quantization of models with compact domain support in the sense described in above .",
    "in particular let us consider the matrix element by ( [ 4 ] ) @xcite @xmath68/\\hbar}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath69 is the unitary time evolution operator , @xmath70 is the hamiltonian , and @xmath71 $ ] is the action between times @xmath72 and @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "the basic observation is that the above representation in terms of the action is not possible when the dynamical variables are to take values inside a compact domain in the sense mentioned earlier .",
    "the reason can be easily understood for a system with one dynamical variable @xmath74 ( field or coordinate ) .",
    "the generalization to systems with more variables is then straightforward .",
    "the identity @xmath75 for the unitary evolution operator @xmath69 , defining @xmath76 , in the @xmath74-basis takes the form : @xmath77 in which @xmath78 is the compact domain in which @xmath74 takes values .",
    "now , by the representation like ( [ 19 ] ) , as the integrand consists of only the ordinary regular functions and not the distribution ones , there is no way that the integral over a compact domain can develop a @xmath79-function . by lacking the representation ( [ 18 ] ) for a unitary time evolution operator ,",
    "the alternative is to assume that time is imaginary ( @xmath80 ) . in the models with discrete time ( @xmath81 ) , by this alternative option the one - step unitary operator @xmath82 is replaced by the so - called transfer - matrix operator @xmath83 whose matrix element between two adjacent times @xmath9 and @xmath84 is given by @xcite @xmath85 in which @xmath86 is the euclidean action . then by common eigen - states for @xmath70 and @xmath83 , the eigen - values of @xmath70 are defined by @xcite @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the corresponding eigen - value of @xmath83 .",
    "provided that @xmath83 does not have negative eigen - values , the above would give a consistent description of the quantum theory based on an action with discrete imaginary time @xcite .",
    "this approach is exactly what is chosen in lattice formulation of gauge theories @xcite , turning space - time to a euclidean one , and it will be used in the present work as well .    in summary , by the considerations mentioned in above , the followings are the basis for model building :    1 .",
    "time is assumed to be discrete and imaginary , taking values @xmath89 for integer @xmath9 .",
    "2 .   the action with discrete time depends on the group elements to enhance the features by the compact nature of group .",
    "for the @xmath90-th direction with coordinate @xmath91 , the u(1 ) group element at @xmath9-th time step is taken as @xmath92 . here for simplicity we take all radii @xmath93 s equal to @xmath23 . following ( [ 17 ] ) the euclidean action takes the form @xmath94 the dimensionless constant @xmath95 is the defining parameter of the model ( we have set @xmath96 ) . the above , as discussed in previous section , is invariant under the shift : @xmath97 with @xmath98 s as integer numbers . at the first place",
    "let us check the limits : @xmath99 leading to @xmath100 which describes the dynamics of an ordinary free particle with mass @xmath101 in the imaginary time formalism .",
    "as mentioned in introduction , the action ( [ 22 ] ) is used in @xcite to model the dynamics of 0-branes at strong coupling limit .",
    "the action ( [ 22 ] ) is the result of dimensional reduction of u(1 ) lattice gauge theory along spstial directions , by setting : @xmath102 the expression ( [ 22 ] ) for the action is also known as the 1d plane - rotator model of magnetic systems @xcite , although here it is interpreted as a discrete worldline equipped by the angle variable coordinates @xmath103 s . in this section we review the construction by @xcite .",
    "it is useful to define the new variables @xmath104 taking values in @xmath51 $ ] , by which the action ( [ 22 ] ) takes the form @xmath105 as the action is fully separable for each direction , it is sufficient to consider only one copy , dropping the index @xmath90 hereafter . as mentioned in sec .  2 ,",
    "the action with discrete imaginary time can be used to define the quantum theory based on the transfer - matrix @xmath83 , defined by its matrix elements @xmath106\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which , recalling @xmath107 , the normalization prefactor has to be inserted to match the propagator ( [ 18 ] ) ( see also ( [ 20 ] ) @xcite @xmath108 using the identity for the modified bessel function of the first kind : @xmath109=\\sum_{s=-\\infty}^\\infty i_s(\\kappa )",

    "this guaranties that the transfer - matrix method defined by ( [ 20 ] ) and ( [ 21 ] ) would lead to a consistent quantum theory . also by @xmath115",
    "the spectrum is doubly degenerate for @xmath116 .",
    "the energy eigenvalues are found by ( [ 21 ] ) and ( [ 34 ] ) @xmath117\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the behavior of above at the limit @xmath118 can be checked by the saddle point approximation for bessel functions @xmath119 by which for ( [ 35 ] ) we obtain @xmath120 matching the energy @xmath121 of a free particle with momentum @xmath122 along the compact direction , and mass @xmath123 by ( [ 25 ] ) .",
    "so in the limit @xmath124 the spectrum approaches to that of an ordinary particle .",

    "the interesting observation by the spectrum ( [ 35 ] ) is about the energy of ground - state , which has a minimum at @xmath131 ; see fig .  1 .",
    "as expected the existence of minimum leads to a first order phase transition .",

    "the equivalence of ( [ 41 ] ) and ( [ 42 ] ) is checked by numerical evaluations .",
    "the basic observation by the compact angle variable in above is , in contrast to the situation with infinite extent coordinates , the normalization factor can not be absorbed by a change of integration variable .",
