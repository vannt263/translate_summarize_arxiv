    "for many years , our knowledge of the wolf - rayet ( w - r ) content of the smc was thought to be complete , with a total of eight discovered . of these ,",
    "four had been found by general studies of the smc s blue stellar population ( see breysacher & westerlund 1978 ) , with an additional four found by an objective prism survey targeted specifically at detecting w - rs by using an interference filter to reduce sky background and crowding ( azzopardi & breysacher 1979 ) .",
    "there matters stood until the discovery of morgan , vassiliadis , & dopita ( 1991 ) of a ninth w - r .",
    "this star was well within the boundary surveyed by azzopardi & breysacher ( 1979 ) , but a few tenths of a magnitude fainter than any of the others .",
    "wolf - rayet stars are the evolved , he - burning descendents of the most massive stars , and their strong emission lines allow them to serve as important tracers of the young stellar population in other galaxies ( massey 1985 ) .",
    "the number of w - r stars in the smc is of interest , as it appears to be disproportionately low compared to that in the lmc , where roughly 130 are known ( breysacher , azzopardi , & testor 1999 ) . the ( visual ) luminosity of the smc is only about a factor of 3.6 less than that of the lmc ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively , van den bergh 2000a ) , and , all other things being equal , we would thus expect @xmath335 w - rs in the smc .",
    "thus the presence of only 9 w - rs suggests an under - abundance by a factor of @xmath4 .    this scarcity , if real , is telling us something interesting either about the progenitor massive star population in the smc , or about how its massive stars evolve in the smc .",
    "let us examine these two possibilities in turn .",
    "since the visual luminosity is dominated by an older population , it could simply be that the massive stars from which w - r evolve are scarcer in the smc due to a steeper initial mass function ( imf ) and/or a lower current star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "what is the available evidence ?",
    "massey ( 1998 ) finds that the imf for massive stars appears to be indistinguishable between the smc and the lmc ( and with the milky way for that matter ) . in that case",
    ", a lack of massive progenitors would require a lower sfr in the smc .",
    "could the current sfr be 4 times lower in the smc than in the lmc ?",
    "let us compare the number of ob associations in the two clouds .",
    "hodge ( 1985 ) catalogs 70 regions in the smc , compared with the 120 found by lucke & hodge ( 1970 ) in the lmc .",
    "( care was taken to use the same selection criteria in the two galaxies , and indeed the size distributions are indistinguishable . )",
    "this would suggest that the smc has a sfr a factor of 2 _ higher _ per unit luminosity than does the lmc . a better measure of the sfr woud be the integrated h@xmath5 luminosity .",
    "however , what is available is not quite this , but rather the total of all the h@xmath5 emission from the discrete h  ii regions . kennicutt ( 1991 ) finds that these require an ionizing flux of @xmath6  photons  s@xmath7 for the smc , and @xmath8  photons  s@xmath7 for the lmc .",
    "the factor of 6 difference would suggest that the sfr is 1.6 times lower per unit luminosity in the smc .",
    "these totals do not include losses from density - bounded h  ii regions , which should result in diffuse emission ; such a correction may or may not be the same for the two clouds . in any event , these data suggest that a lack of massive stars is not the primary cause for the factor of 34 under - abundance of w - rs in the smc compared to the lmc .",
    "on the other hand , we have good reason to suspect that the low metallicity of the smc will have a significant effect on the evolution of massive stars , as there are smaller mass - loss rates at a given luminosity . in the  conti scenario \" ( conti 1976 ;",
    "maeder & conti 1994 ) wolf - rayet stars are produced as a massive star loses mass via stellar winds ; during the he - burning stage the outer layers have been sufficiently stripped to reveal the h - burning products at the surface and the star is spectroscopically identified as a wn - type wolf - rayet .",
    "further mass - loss leads to a wc - type , with the products of he - burning ( c , o ) revealed in the spectrum .",
    "the strong , broad emission lines are the result of a highly extended and rapidly expanding stellar atmosphere ; e.g. , optical depth unity occurs at a point in the stellar wind .",
    "we would thus expect that stars that evolve to w - rs in the smc would have to be of higher luminosity ( and mass ) than those in galaxies with higher metallicity .",
    "( the oxygen abundance is a factor of @xmath323@xmath9 lower in the smc than in the lmc ( lequeux et al .",
    "1979 ; russell & dopita 1992 ) .",
    "indeed , the high proportion of wn - type wolf - rayets to those of wc - type in the smc ( 8:1 ) is consistent with the hypothesis that wcs are harder to produce at low metallicities due to smaller mass - loss rates , and is in accord with the smc s metallicity compared to other local group galaxies ( massey & johnson 1998 ) .",
    "recent studies of coeval clusters and associations suggest that  cut - off \" mass for becoming a w - r star is about 70@xmath10 in the smc , while stars with initial masses greater than 30 @xmath10 become w - rs in the lmc ( massey , waterhouse , & degioia - eastwood 2000 ) ; in the milky way the limit may be as low as 18@xmath10 ( massey , degioia - eastwood , & waterhouse 2001 ) .    however , the discovery of the ninth smc w - r by morgan et al .",
    "( 1991 ) raises the question of the completness of previous surveys .",
    "we were naturally curious if a significant additional population of w - rs remained to be found in the smc .",
    "we have had good success in searching for w - rs in nearby galaxies using a set of interference filters optimized to detect w - rs ( e.g. , armandroff & massey 1985 , massey , armandroff , & conti 1986 ; massey & johnson 1998 ) .",
    "accordingly we decided to survey the smc using the ctio / michigan schmidt with these filters during a gap in our main observing program last year .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy this year identified 8 hitherto unknown interesting objects in the smc , including 4  of \" stars , a luminous blue variable ( lbv ) candidate , a symbiotic star , and two newly found wolf - rayet stars .",
    "we describe our survey , these newly found objects , and the implications here .",
    "images were taken with the ctio curtis schmidt telescope during ( ut ) 1999 october 23 - 28 .",
    "the field - of - view was @xmath11 using the tektronix 2048 detector ; the scale was 2.3 arcsec pixel@xmath7 . outside the central @xmath12",
    "pixel region our 2-inch filters caused vignetting , with the amount of light decreasing to 3040% on the sides , and to 515% in the extreme corners .",
    "we covered a 9.6 square - degree area centered on the smc with 12 ( very ) overlapping fields to make the effects of this vignetting minor .",
    "the region surveyed is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : smc ] , where we have also indicated the area covered by azzopardi & breysacher ( 1979 ) .",
    "our interference filter set is described in detail by massey & johnson ( 1998 ) : the _ wc _ filter is centered on c  iii  @xmath13 , the _ wn _ filter is centered on he  ii  @xmath14 , and the continuum _ ct _ filter is centered at 4750   . the band - passes are approximately 50  wide .",
    "the effective wavelengths of these filters used in the fast f/3.5 beam of the schmidt were close to these nominal values ( 4646    for the _ wc _ filter and 4685    for the _ wn _ filter ) .    for each of the 12 fields",
    ", we obtained 3 consecutive 600 sec exposures in each of the 3 filters ( i.e. , 9 per field ) .",
    "the data were biased and trimmed in the usual manner , with twilight exposures serving as our flat - fields .",
    "stars brighter than @xmath15 were saturated .",
    "owing to the under - sampling , we performed only aperture photometry on the images . nevertheless , analyzing the frames was a daunting task , with _ over 1.6 million _",
    "stellar images measured . each image was treated separately , with the photometry averaged for the 3 exposures through each filter at the end .",
    "a 2.5 pixel ( 5.8 arcsec ) radius aperture was used throughout .",
    "observations of several galactic w - r stars were used to set the instrumental zero - point of the _ ct _ magnitudes to that of @xmath16 ( an emission - free equivalent of _ v _ introduced by smith 1968b ) with the assumption ( borne out by the results ) that there were minimal color effects .",
    "photometry from field to field was remarkably consistent , with typical differences @xmath17  mag for bright stars from night to night .    in order to identify w - r candidates we obtained the magnitude differences _ wc",
    " ct _ and _ wn  ct _ for all the objects in a field .",
    "stars significantly brighter in one of the emission - line filters than in the continuum filter were judged to be likely candidates . as in our earlier work ,  significantly brighter \" was determined by using the actual statistical uncertainties of the photometry ; a magnitude difference had to be at least five times this value ( i.e. , 5@xmath18 ) to be considered a viable candidate .",
    "in addition , we ignored stars which appeared only 0.05  mag brighter in one of the on - line filters .",
    "we expect a difference of 0.25  mag to correspond roughly to an emission - line equivalent width ( ew ) of @xmath19   , about the limit of wolf - rayet stars ( massey & johnson 1998 and discussion therein ) .",
    "our photometry went sufficiently deep that such a star should be readily detected at @xmath20 , corresponding to @xmath21 , adopting a true distance modulus of 18.9 ( van den bergh 2000b ) and typical @xmath22  mag extinction ( massey et al .",
    "this luminosity is just what is expected for for early - type wn stars ( vacca & torres - dodgen 1990 ) in the lmc or milky way , although such stars tend to have considerably stronger ews ( conti & massey 1989 ) .",
    "indeed , the ave ew of he  ii  @xmath0 of the lmc wns is @xmath23   , and we estimate that such a star would exhibit a magnitude difference of -1.7  mag , and be detected at the @xmath24 level at @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .    the results of our analysis were encouraging . with the exception of hd  5980 ( which was saturated ) ,",
    "all of the known smc w - r stars were found repeatedly on every field they appeared , typically with significance levels of 30@xmath18 or more .",
    "for instance , the strong - lined , bright w - r star ab4 ( @xmath27 ) was found with a _",
    "wn  ct _ difference of @xmath280.80  mag , at a significance level of 78@xmath18 and 87@xmath18 on the two overlapping frames on which it appeared .",
    "the faintest previously known w - r star , the one discovered by morgan et al .  ( 1991 ) , with @xmath29 , was identified as a w - r  candidate \" on all 3 fields in which it appeared , with a _",
    "ct _ difference of @xmath30  mag at a significance level of 11@xmath18 , 16@xmath18 , and 12@xmath18 .",
    "although the w - r star hd  5980 itself was saturated on our frames , the nearby strong - lined o7  if+ star sk  80 was detected ( due to he  ii  @xmath14 emission ) on all four overlapping frames that included that region , with a _",
    " ct_=@xmath31  mag at a significance level of 2329@xmath18 .",
    "thus we had some confidence that our detection technique would find any remaining w - r stars even if they were significantly fainter and/or weaker - lined than the known ones .",
    "spectra of all the good candidates were obtained on the night of ( ut ) 2000 oct 10 with the ctio 1.5-m ccd spectrometer .",
    "a 527 line mm@xmath7 grating ( no .",
    "16 ) was used in first order with no blocking filter to provide spectral coverage 39905950    with a spectral resolution of 4.2    ( 1.5    pixel@xmath7 ) .",
    "a 3 arcsec slit was used in order to provide reasonable spectrophotometry .",
    "the known smc w - rs ( with the exception of hd  5980 ) were also observed , as well as the o7  if star sk  80 . on subsequent nights ( 2000",
    "oct 11 - 14 ) additional data were taken on the most interesting stars ( including hd  5980 ) at higher resolution using the 831  line  mm@xmath7 ( no .",
    "47 ) in second order with a cuso@xmath32 blocking filter .",
    "this set - up provided a wavelength coverage of 40904750   , with 1.4    resolution ( 0.5    pixel@xmath7 ) with a 1 arcsec slit .",
    "our reductions followed the usual procedures , with the flat - fielding accomplished by exposures of the  punto blanco \" ( 3 - 4 hrs in the case of the higher dispersion grating ) .",
    "for the spectral extractions , we used the optimized extraction routines within iraf , with care being take to select clean sky on other side of the object . in the case of nebulosity we performed several extractions in an effort to minimize the under- or over - subtraction of nebular emission .    not unexpectedly , most of our candidates turned out to be bogus for one reason or another , usually related to the poor spatial resolution of the schmidt images ; e.g. , two stars of very different colors were unresolved on our frames .",
    "we also expect spurious detections ( particularly those found on a single frame ) simply due to the number of 5@xmath18 outliers expected given the large number of stars photometered .",
    "many of our w - r candidates proved to be k - type dwarfs , but which were detected at high significance level due to the strong , broad mgh  @xmath33 feature which depressed the _",

    "a total of @xmath34 unknown sources were examined , of which roughly a third proved of interest .",
    "we discuss our more successful discoveries in the following section .",
    "two of our high - significance candidates proved to be wolf - rayet stars of wn3 type .",
    "we list their properties in table  1 , along with those of the other smc w - rs .",
    "in addition to the spectrophotometry from our spectra , we also have curtis schmidt _ bvr _ images of our fields obtained on 1999 jan 8 as part of our search for red supergiants in the smc ; we have used these data to provide @xmath35 and @xmath36 photometry for our stars . although  line - free \" _ v _ and _ b - v _ values for the w - r stars would be preferable ( smith 1968b ) , we have used our spectrophotometry to substantiate that the corrections are minor for these relatively weak - lined w - rs , and we use the broad - band colors to correct for reddening until we can obtain better calibrated spectrophotometry .",
    "( the exception is the newly found w - r smc - wr10 , for which nebulosity significantly affected the @xmath36 colors , and hence we have used the spectrophotometry . )",
    "we adopt a single @xmath37 for all the w - r subclasses ( see fig .  4 of pyper 1966 ) .",
    "a value of @xmath38 corresponds to a realistic minimum reddening , and @xmath22 is typical for early - type stars in the smc ( massey et al .",

    "was adopted in computing @xmath40 .",
    "the smc w - rs were throughly discussed by conti , massey , & garmany ( 1989 ) , who used sit - vidicon spectrophotometry along with moderate resolution photographic spectra to provide descriptions of each of the 8 smc w - r stars known then .",

    "such studies eschew emission - line stars ( see discussion in rodrigues et al .",
    "1997 ) ; apparently the objective prism  b2 \" classification was taken literally .",
    "our survey detected the star s18=av  154 , a b[e ] star that has many lbv - like characteristics ( morris et al .",
    "s18 was detected on three overlapping fields , observed during three consecutive nights ( ut 1999 oct 25 - 27 ) , and during this time the _ ct _ magnitude faded from 13.59 to 13.74 .",
    "our spectrum was taken a year later . at the first look at the spectrum",
    "we were confused that the star had been a candidate at all , as there was no detectable he  ii  @xmath14 present , despite numerous other emission lines .",
    "( the object was a 95@xmath18 candidate ! ) however , the spectrum shown by shore , sanduleak , & allen ( 1987 ) clearly does show strong he  ii @xmath0 .",
    "thus we conclude that he  ii @xmath0 emission was strongly present when our imaging was taken in 1999 oct , despite its absence a year later when we obtained the spectrum .",
    "its absence during 2000 oct is not without precedent , however , as zickgraf et al .",
    "( 1989 ) also reported the line as having been missing in a 1987 spectrogram .",
    "this star is discussed extensively by morris et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , who emphasize the need for further monitoring . here",
    "we draw attention to its spectral similarity to s  dor , the archetypical lbv , during its 1996 oct  low \" state ( massey 2000 ) .",
    "we compare the two in fig .",
    "[ fig : s18 ] . given the photometric variability , high luminosity , spectral changes , and its spectral similarity spectrally to s  dor , one would be hard - pressed not to consider this an lbv .",
    "the star is located in ob association 35 ( hodge 1985 ) , the same association which our newly discovered o5f?p star is found .",
    "our study of the environments of lbvs in the magellanic clouds and milky way suggest that the lbvs which are members of coeval regions are nearly always found with extremely massive stars . a detailed study of h35 is doubtless warranted .",
    "the last star of interest was included in the list of h@xmath5 emission - line stars given by meyssonnier & azzopardi ( 1993 ) , their number 1748 .",
    "nothing else was previously known about the star .",
    "its spectrum , shown in fig  [ fig : symbiotic ] , was clearly of a symbiotic star .",
    "it does not appear in the recent catalog of symbiotic stars by belczynski et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and appears to be only the seventh such object known in the smc .",
    "howard bond and tony keyes kindly pointed out its similarity to that of the galactic symbiotic star ag  dra , illustrated in fig  a.14 of kenyon ( 1986 ) . with @xmath79",
    ", we would estimate an absolute magnitude of @xmath80 , not inconsistent with the typical @xmath81 quoted by kenyon ( 1986 ) .",
    "our survey discovered two previously unknown wolf - rayet stars , bringing the total number in the smc to 11 .",
    "although we can not preclude a wolf - rayet star or two as having been overlooked in our survey , particularly in crowded regions , we believe this study underscores that there is _ not _ a significant number of w - rs waiting to be discovered in the smc .",
    "thus w - r stars are under - abundant in the smc by a factor of 3 ( per unit luminosity ) compared with the lmc .",
    "as we argue in section 1 , we believe that this supports the view that it requires a higher mass to become a w - r in the smc than it does in the lmc , due to the effect of lower metallicity on stellar winds .",
    "it is iteresting that both of the newly - found w - rs show the presence of absorption lines . when breysacher & azzopardi ( 1979 ) first announced the discovery of four additional w - r stars in the smc , and noted that all appeared to show some sign of ob companions , the inital reaction was that probably roche - lobe enhanced mass - loss was crucial to a massive star becoming a w - r at low metallicity  that presumably stellar winds by themselves were not sufficient .",
    "subsequently , conti et al .",
    "( 1989 ) re - examined this point , noting that the case for _ bona - fide _ binarity was poorly established for most of the smc w - rs .",
    "an alterantive explanation for the prevelance of absorption lines in the spectra of the smc w - rs could simply be that the stellar winds are weaker , allowing normal photospheric lines to be seen . over a decade",
    "later , orbit solutions still exist for only the same three smc w - rs , with the situation for a fourth ( hd  5980 ) made even more complex by its lbv outburst .",
    "a radial velocity study is currently underway for all of the smc w - rs , which we expect to be complete after the 2001 magellanic cloud observing season .",
    "we do note that the statistics for the smc are very different than for the lmc : for the latter , an absorption - line spectrum is seen only for the brighter systems , consistent with the fact that an ob companion will make the system brighter than on average ( vanbeveren & conti 1980 ) .",
    "the presence of absorption lines in even the faintest of the smc w - rs _ could _ suggest that they are in fact all binaries  or equally well that the absorption lines are seen thanks to a weak stellar wind .",
    "we note that the smc w - rs are , on average , more luminous than their counterparts in the milky way or lmc .",
    "ignoring the  + abs \" systems , vacca & torres - dogden ( 1990 ) find and average @xmath82 for the early - type wns ; the average for the same type stars in the smc is @xmath83 , where we of course have to include  + abs \" systems as most of the stars show absorption lines .",
    "such an average is considerably more luminous even than the @xmath84 adopted by conti & vacca ( 1990 ) for the  wne+abs \" systems .",
    "this can not be a selection effect , as we argued earlier , as our survey went penty deep enough to find both weaker - lined , fainter stars .",
    "this _ could _",
    "mean that in general the w - rs in the smc do have binary companions which dominate the continuum . or",
    ", it could simply be a reflection of the higher luminosity requirement needed for stellar winds to lead to the w - r stage at lower metallicities .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the ctio support staff for their help .",
    "the curtis schmidt imaging kindly came about via director s discretionary time .",
