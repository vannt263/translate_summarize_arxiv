    "a quantitative understanding of the quark propagation and hadron formation processes in a nuclear medium would greatly benefit the study of the quark - gluon plasma and its evolution in time .",
    "quark propagation in a nuclear medium involves competing processes like hadronization of quarks and quark energy loss through multiple scattering and gluon radiation .",
    "semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering of leptons on the nucleus provides a unique opportunity to study these effects on quark propagation and hadronization . therefore , in the past three decades , semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering on nuclear targets has been one of the most active frontiers in nuclear physics and particle physics .",
    "the pioneering measurements of the hadronization in a nuclear medium were done at slac@xmath1}$ ] in 1978 .",
    "additional data on multiplicity ratios were measured by the e665 experiment at fermilab@xmath2}$ ] and the emc experiment@xmath3}$ ] using ultra - high - energy muons on various nuclear targets . in 1991 ,",
    "the emc collaboration compared the differential multiplicities of forward produced hadrons in deep inelastic muon scattering on carbon , copper and tin targets with those from deuterium .",
    "multiplicity ratios were observed to increase toward unity as the virtual photon energy @xmath4 and decrease with the energy fraction @xmath5 of the virtual photon carried away by the leading hadron .",
    "more recently , a series of semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering measurements on various targets was performed with the hermes detector at the desy laboratory using a 27.6-gev positron or electron beam@xmath6}$ ] .",
    "the hadron multiplicity ratios on several nuclei relative to the deuteron revealed a systematic decrease with the mass number a and increase ( decrease ) with increasing values of @xmath7 .    in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering of leptons on the nucleus , there are two different nuclear effects , that is , the initial state nuclear effect and final - state nuclear effect . in the initial state ,",
    "the lepton interacts with the quark in the nucleus .",
    "the impact of the nuclear medium on parton distribution functions is referred to as the initial state nuclear effect . in the final state",
    ", the struck quark traverses the nuclear matter , then fragments into hadrons .",
    "the so - called final - state nuclear effect is the effect of the nuclear medium on the quark propagation and hadron formation processes .",
    "after the discovery of the emc effect@xmath8}$ ] , nuclear modifications relative to nucleon parton distribution functions are usually referred to as nuclear effects on parton distribution functions , which include nuclear shadowing , antishadowing , the emc effect , and fermi motion effect in different regions of the parton momentum fraction .",
    "so far , three groups have presented their global analysis of the nuclear parton distribution functions analogous to those of the free proton : eskola et al .",
    "@xmath9}$ ] , by hirai et al.@xmath10}$ ] , and by de florian and sassot ( nds ) @xmath11}$ ] .",
    "many theoretical phenomenological models were proposed to describe the final - state nuclear effect in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering of leptons on the nucleus .",
    "the phenomenological models@xmath12}$ ] used various formation times and absorption cross sections for the various hadrons in the nuclear medium .",
    "the gluon bremsstrahlung model@xmath13}$ ] described the production of fast leading mesons in nuclei by combination of a modification of the fragmentation function in the medium owing to energy loss caused by gluon radiation with hadron rescattering .",
    "the rescaling model@xmath14}$ ] hypothesized that the modification of quark distribution and fragmentation functions was supplemented by nuclear absorption .",
    "another class of models@xmath15}$ ] took account of the energy loss that the struck quark experienced in the nuclear environment without nuclear absorption effect .",
    "the probabilistic coupled - channel transport model@xmath16}$ ] was based on the boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck equation .",
    "these models reproduce qualitatively the global features of the data .",
    "but it is worth noting that the models do not perform quantitative fits to experimental data by @xmath17 calculation .",
    "based on the bialas picture@xmath18}$ ] , a more simplistic presentation of the process of hadronization can be described in terms of just the hadron formation time .",
    "the hadron formation time is defined as the time between the moment that the quark is struck by the virtual photon and the moment that the hadron is formed . according to the hadron formation time , the quark hadronization that occurs outside the nucleus can be distinguished from that occuring inside the nucleus .",
    "if hadronization takes place outside the nucleus , semi - inclusive deep inelastic lepton - nucleus collisions are used to study the quark propagation in a nuclear medium and , further , gain information on quark energy loss .",
    "the nuclear drell - yan process is an ideal tool to investigate the initial - state energy loss effect because the produced lepton pair does not interact strongly with the partons in the nucleus . in the previous articles@xmath19}$ ] , by using the nuclear parton distribution functions from a global analysis , nuclear drell - yan production cross - section ratios were calculated for 800-gev protons incident on a variety of nuclear targets , with consideration of the energy loss of the projectile at the hadron level and parton level separately . with the introduction of two representative parametrizations of quark energy loss , we obtained the incoming quark energy loss per unit length by comparing the nuclear drell - yan experimental data . in this paper ,",
    "the experimental data with the quarks hadronization occuring outside the nucleus are picked out in accordance with the hadron formation time . the quark energy loss in semi - inclusive deep inelastic lepton - nucleus scattering",
    "is extracted by the @xmath17 analysis method .",
    "it is hoped to gain new knowledge about quark energy loss in a nuclear medium .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "a brief formalism for hadron production in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering on the nucleus and nuclear modification of the fragmentation functions owing to quark energy loss is given in sect.ii , followed by a presentation of the formation time in sect.iii .",

    "if hadrons are produced inside the medium , the length given previously is no longer correct .",
    "therefore , excluding the influence of nuclear absorption , and considering only the case where hadrons are produced outside the nucleus , the hadron multiplicity can be expressed as @xmath52",
