    "note that the cloning operation works with the success rate @xmath175 and for the remaining cases we do not detect any coincidences .",
    "thus , for the particular initial state of the cloning machine , a fraction of @xmath176 of the photons sent by alice is absorbed by the cloning machine . in our experiment",
    "this fraction is about @xmath177 , which corresponds to about 7db of losses .",
    "in this section we demonstrate that the source of photons used in our experiments approximates a single - photon source ( sps ) to be used by alice in qkd .",
    "the sps is approximated by one of the modes of the down - converted light . in our experiment",
    "the intensity of the down - converted light is low to ensure that the probability of generating four ( and larger numbers ) of photons is negligible .",
    "the photon statistics of such down - converted beam is described by a thermal distribution @xmath178  @xcite with a small average number of photons @xmath179 ( we ensure that in the experiment ) . thus , @xmath180 and we work with an approximate source of photon pairs @xmath181 , where each of the photons is in a different spatial mode .    generating a photon in the first - order process is a random event .",
    "the down - conversion events appear independently of the number of down - converted photons @xmath106 in the time window of 1ns , thus the probability of having @xmath106 photons is given by poisson s distribution : @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the average number of photons in the time window .",
    "we can calculate the probability of not detecting any photons in the 1ns window directly from the number of detector clicks @xmath184 that appeared as @xmath185 .",
    "this is correct if the usual time interval between two detection events is larger than the dead time of the detectors corresponding to about 35ns . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath186 can be also calculated using a mathematical model of the on / off ( bucket ) detectors of efficiency @xmath13 ( in our experiment @xmath187 ) as @xmath188 where the only unknown @xmath189 is estimated numerically to be @xmath190 assuming @xmath191 and @xmath187 .",
    "therefore the probability of having more than one photon in the time window is equal to @xmath192 moreover , since the probability of not having photons in the 35ns dead time window is very high as it reaches @xmath193 , the above - presented reasoning provides results in good agreement with our other estimates ."

    "<S> spatially - separated photon pairs of @xmath76 nm wavelength are created in noncolinear type i degenerate spontaneous parametric down - conversion process in liio@xmath77 crystal ( 1 cm thick ) pumped by a cw kr@xmath78 laser beam ( tem@xmath79 mode , 250mw of optical power ) . </S>",
    "<S> our source approximates two synchronized spss with the accuracy adequate for our demonstration , since the probability of having more than one photon in a mode for the 1ns detection window is much lower than the probability of single - photon detection ( approx . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath80  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the emitted photons are in a separable polarization state ; hence , alice s state encoded as the signal does not change the polarization of the probe . </S>",
    "<S> random choice of the states sent by alice ensures that the polarization of the two photons is uncorrelated . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to having two independent but synchronized spss . </S>",
    "<S> however , in a real attack eve would have to use a separate sps . </S>",
    "<S> the photons propagate from the source to the oqc input via single - mode fibers . </S>",
    "<S> the photons are coherently superposed on the polarization - dependent beam splitter ( pdbs ) . </S>",
    "<S> next , the photons are subjected to polarization - sensitive filtering in both output modes ( see bda in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : setup ] ) . finally , we postselect on coincidences  one photon in each of the two output modes of the cloner  and carry out polarization analysis of the two - photon state  @xcite . using our tomographical data , we estimated the two - photon density matrix applying the maximum likelihood method  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we used the tomography results to numerically simulate eve s attack assuming that she probes alice s photon , keeps the probe until key sifting , and passes the probed photon to bob ( for details see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we calculated the @xmath0 and secret - key rate and compared them with theoretical predictions in table  [ tab : exp ] .    </S>",
    "<S> .[tab : exp ] performance of the oqc for bb84 and r04 . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental values ( subscript @xmath81 ) of the @xmath0 and the secret - key rate @xmath82 calculated from the measured density matrices are compared with theoretical predictions ( subscript @xmath83 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the success probability @xmath84 of the oqc was estimated as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . the oqc parameters @xmath23 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24 determine the shrinking of the bloch sphere due to the cloning . [ </S>",
    "<S> cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results indicate that our attack would be possible if qm was available . however , to deploy this device in a real qkd network , one has to consider several technological aspects of this attack . </S>",
    "<S> first , because of its probabilistic nature , the oqc introduces losses . </S>",
    "<S> the success probability of @xmath85 corresponds to 7 - 10db losses . </S>",
    "<S> observing such losses might indicate that the line is insecure . </S>",
    "<S> thus , eve must mask these losses as usual channel losses . supposing typical fibers losses of 3.5db / km ( as for the fibers in our experiment and in  @xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> , eve would need to replace 2 - 3 km of the line with a fiber of negligible losses . </S>",
    "<S> using photons at telecom wavelengths would be more practical than 826 nm light for communicating over large distances since , for the telecom - window wavelengths , the loses are @xmath860.2db / km  @xcite , which makes the distances about ten times larger and eve s task more difficult . </S>",
    "<S> typical detectors , designed for the telecom regime , provide low efficiency of about 0.25 ( approx . </S>",
    "<S> 6db of losses ) and high dark - count rate , i.e. , noise . </S>",
    "<S> much larger losses , which could enable eavesdropping , appear for long - range free - space transmission reaching , e.g. , 157db for photons reflected from the ajisai satellite  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> eve should also control the unsuccessful cases when the signal and the probe propagate to bob , who can detect them and raise alarm . </S>",
    "<S> eve can achieve this by using quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurement  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if she does not find a photon in her output mode , she will close the line towards bob . </S>",
    "<S> finally , eve s attack relies on the perfect overlap between the signal and the probe photons ( hong - ou - mandel s interference ) . </S>",
    "<S> typical full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of photons generated via spontaneous parametric down - conversion corresponds to tens of @xmath87 m . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the requirement on the two - photon overlap is of the order of @xmath87 m . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a few fs . </S>",
    "<S> any jitter caused by alice leads to the reduced two - photon overlap , lower purity and fidelity of the output states . </S>",
    "<S> eve can however overcome this by performing the qnd detection at her oqc input , which triggers the cloning process but requires photon generation on demand . in a real cloning attack eve </S>",
    "<S> has to prepare photons of the same spectral properties as the photons sent by alice . in our experiment </S>",
    "<S> we use photons at 826 nm with spectral width fwhm=8.9 nm ( 160fs coherence time ) . </S>",
    "<S> these are typical values reached by alice using a femtosecond laser as a photon source . </S>",
    "<S> let us note that the photon peaks need to overlap as perfectly as possible making the acceptable time difference corresponding to a fraction of coherence time which changes as wavelength squared divided by fwhm . </S>",
    "<S> hence , overlapping is easier for longer wavelengths ( e.g. , in the telecom window ) and narrow fwhm . </S>",
    "<S> both the parameters should be tuned by alice to maximize the security of the qkd .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions . </S>",
    "<S>  _ we investigated the feasibility of symmetric individual attacks on bb84  @xcite and r04  @xcite assuming that eve tracks the key sifting and uses a multifunctional oqc  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we optimized quantum cloning such that the minimum mutual information between an eavesdropper and a legitimate user was equal to the mutual information between the legitimate users at the lowest @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , legitimate users can not distil a secret key from their raw key bits . </S>",
    "<S> consequently we found tolerable @xmath0 for this kind of attack to be @xmath2 for bb84 and r04 . </S>",
    "<S> we performed the proof - of - principle experiment in which @xmath88 was attained for @xmath89 for bb84 and @xmath90 for r04 . </S>",
    "<S> our experiment together with the reported progress in development of qm ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) suggest that , even in the presence of spss and perfect detectors , the qkd could be successfully attacked with a probe similar to ours if alice and bob tolerate too high @xmath0 ( see table  [ tab : exp ] ) or losses ( approx . @xmath91db for our device ) . </S>",
    "<S> our experiment shows that the oqcs are interesting both from the fundamental and practical points of view as tools of quantum cryptanalysis as they establish the security bound for an important class of qkds .    </S>",
