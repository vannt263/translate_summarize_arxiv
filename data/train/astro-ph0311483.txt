    "ground - based @xmath0-ray astronomy ( at energies @xmath1 gev ) has been developing rapidly in the last 10 years .",
    "the advent of a number of _ next - generation _ instruments in 2003/2004 promises exciting new results and answers to some long - standing questions . strongly motivating the development of new detectors and telescopes , are the questions surrounding the acceleration of particles to multi - tev energies in many galactic environments .",
    "it has been known for some time that various evolutionary paths following a supernova explosion can lead to the production of high energy cosmic ray ( cr ) electrons and hadrons to tev energies and above , and with them , @xmath0-radiation as the most accessible _ tracer _ of this process . the main motivation driving the search for galactic tev sources has been concerned with the origin of these cr .",
    "in particular the shell type snr have long been thought responsible for the hadronic cr up to the knee energy @xmath2ev . from the first convincing discovery of tev @xmath0-rays from the crab plerion @xmath320 years ago ( weekes et al . 1989 ) ,",
    "galactic objects now comprise a large fraction of catalogued tev @xmath0-ray emitters .    in this review",
    ", i will outline the present and future developments in ground - based @xmath0-ray astronomy , emphasising the imaging atmospheric technique , and also review the various galactic objects identified as sources of tev @xmath0-rays .",
    "some present and future scientific questions are also posed .",
    "other reviews of the field , some including summaries of experiments using other techniques to detect tev @xmath0-rays may be found in aharonian 1999 , weekes 2000 , rowell 2001 and ong 2003 .",
    "ground - based @xmath0-ray detection relies on the sampling of extensive air showers ( eas ) through their copious photon yield .",
    "eas comprise the secondary cascade particles ( mostly @xmath4 ) generated as a primary @xmath0-ray interacts with the earth s atmosphere , and the photons carry specific information about eas development . a major feature is the huge effective collection area @xmath5 @xmath6 afforded by the wide area over which the photons are distributed over the ground .",
    "the most powerful technique involves viewing the angular resolution of these photons .",
    "this can yield accurate information concerning the primary @xmath0-ray energy and direction of origin .",
    "such telescopes employ large segmented mirrors with focal plane arrays or cameras of fast ( ns resolution ) photomultiplier tubes .",
    "these cameras permit parametrisation of images , usually as an elliptical profile such that the major axis aligns with the direction of origin of the primary @xmath0-ray .",
    "single views of each image provide an event - by - event angular resolution of @xmath70.15@xmath8 , for typical pixel granularities of order @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "imaging cameras have also achieved quite large fields of view ( fov ) of order 5@xmath8 , permitting survey observations .",
    "the detection of tev @xmath0-rays must be made however , against the dominating background of cr .",
    "cr also produce eas , and hence images that are recorded by telescopes .",
    "due to intrinsic differences in the development of eas for @xmath0-rays and cr ( hadronic interactions are present in the latter ) , images for cr tend be more irregular in shape . furthermore crs also arrive isotropically , reflecting their randomised trajectories through interstellar and intergalactic magnetic fields .",
    "the imaging technique thus provides a powerful means to preferentially select @xmath0-ray - like events via the use of directional and shape cuts . following the pioneering performance of the whipple telescope , other major systems such as cangaroo , cat and hegra attained similar , or slightly improved performance , albeit at differing energy thresholds , @xmath11 to @xmath3 few tev , owing to various mirror areas and other factors .",
    "a further , significant improvement in performance is attained from multiple or stereo views of the same image . by taking advantage of the uncorrelated nature of eas image fluctuations , systems of telescopes , separated by @xmath12 m",
    "can achieve an angular resolution proportional to @xmath13 for @xmath14 views of the same image ( hofmann et al .",
    "for the same reasons , cr background rejection based on image shape also improves significantly .",
    "typical background rejection fractions can exceed 99.99% after all cuts applicable to a pointlike source . the recently decommissioned hegra iact - system ( phlhofer et al . 2003 ) , consisting of 5x4 metre diameter telescopes demonstrated clearly the power of stereoscopy coupled with the use of large fov cameras .",
    "other benefits of the stereoscopic technique include much improved energy resolution and also a reduction in systematics across the fov , easing the task of performing surveys for new sources .",
    "to date a total of 8 galactic candidates , listed in table  [ tab : sourcelist ] , are now observed as tev @xmath0-ray sources . of those listed ,",
    "only the crab has been confirmed unambiguously by completely independent groups .",
    "i confine my list here to those sources appearing in the recent refereed literature ( @xmath151995 ) and seen at a statistical significance @xmath16 . for the most recent results the reader",
    "is directed to proceedings of the 28th international cosmic ray conference in japan , which suggests tev emission from a few more candidates .",

    "_ * crab : * _ the crab was the first source confirmed as a tev emitter by the whipple collaboration , and is now clearly detected by all groups active in the field .",
    "it is considered the standard candle in the field .",
    "the crab flux has proved to be steady within instrument systematics , and exhibits an energy spectrum fitted by a pure power law over a remarkably large energy range 0.2 to 70 tev ( see for e.g. horns et al 2003 ) .",
    "the crab is the most intensely studied pulsar / plerion and the unpulsed tev flux is universally considered to arise from the inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering of local ( soft & synchrotron ) photons by the shocked wind electrons filling the crab plerion .",
    "these same electrons give rise to the very intense broad - band synchrotron spectrum extending from radio to x - ray energies . at the high energy end",
    "however the contribution of accelerated hadrons which lead to @xmath0 emission via @xmath23 decay could also become significant ( aharonian & atoyan 1996a ) .",
    "this rather hard hadronic component may be required to explain the unbroken continuation of the crab spectrum to @xmath24 tev .",
    "an ic cutoff would normally be expected due to electron cooling and the klein - nishina reduction in ic cross section .",
    "+ _ * psr b1706@xmath2244 : * _ steady tev emission from this source was reported by cangaroo and confirmed by the durham group ( kifune 1995 ; chadwick et al .",
    "1998 ) . as for the crab ,",
    "the plerionic shocked pulsar wind could give rise to the unpulsed tev emission , which is reportedly at similar levels to the crab tev flux .",
    "however , the very weak synchrotron x - ray flux , only recently seen by _ chandra _ ( gotthelf et al . 2002 ) leads to a strong underprediction of the ic tev for reasonable values of the magnetic field @xmath25 g .",
    "one possible way out is for the high energy electrons to escape quickly to regions of lower @xmath26 ( aharonian et al .",
    "+ _ * vela : * _ this is another plerion , whose unpulsed tev emission has been interpreted in the electronic ic framework . complicating matters somewhat",
    ", the cangaroo discovery found the tev emission 0.13@xmath8 offset from the pulsar position ( yoshikoshi et al .",
    "1997 ) , not far from its supposed birthplace .",
    "it is possible that a relic electron wind may be responsible for the plerionic synchrotron x - ray and ic tev emission although this implies very low @xmath26 fields ( harding et al .",
    "an alternative hadronic picture is put forward by aharonian 1999 as well as the unshocked electronic wind scenario of aharonian & bogovalov ( 2003 ) .",
    "+ _ * sn1006 : * _ this historical young shell type snr expanding into a relatively sparse environment exhibits a predominantly featureless x - ray spectrum , considered to be synchrotron emission",
    ". the bi - polar morphology of sn1006 in x - rays may trace out regions of more efficient electron injection .",
    "tev emission has been seen from the slightly brighter ( in x - rays ) ne rim ( tanimori et al .",
    "1998 ) , and was initally attributed to the electronic ic process . however , as for psr b1706@xmath2244 and vela , very low @xmath27 g fields are required to match the cangaroo flux .",
    "it also appears that the hadronic component may play a significant role ( aharonian & atoyan 1999 ; berezkho et al . 2002 ) , particularly given the recent high - resolution results of _ chandra _ which favour higher @xmath28 g fields in the post - shocked regions ( bamba et al .",
    "+ _ * rxj1713.7@xmath22394 : * _ this older shell - type snr appears to show tev emission at its nw rim ( enomoto et al .",
    "2002 ) , not far from a neighbouring molecular cloud with high ambient matter density .",
    "there is also strong non - thermal x - ray emission from this area .",
    "interpretation was initially centred on the electronic ic component but more recently re - evaluation was made in strong favour of the hadronic origin for the accelerated particles .",
    "as for sn1006 , the high resolution filamentary structure seen by _",
    ", pointing to a high @xmath26 field would certainly favour the hadronic component as discussed by uchiyama et al . 2003 .",
    "+ _ * cas a : * _ the youngest shell - type snr , cas - a is one of the strongest radio sources .",
    "the hegra detection of tev emission was made using a very deep exposure of @xmath29 hrs ( aharonian et al .",
    "the tev flux appears to favour a hadronic interpretation since the very high magnetic field in cas - a , few@xmath3 mg , quenches strongly any electronic component ( ic and bremsstrahlung ) at @xmath30 tev ( atoyan et al . 2000 ; berezhko et al .",
    "more detailed spectral information at @xmath31tev should solve this issue .",
    "+ _ * cen x-3 : * _ this high mass x - ray binary contains a 4.8 s pulsar in a 2.1 day orbit around an o - type supergiant and has also been seen by egret at low gev energies . neither the gev or tev fluxes appear modulated with the pulsar orbital period ( chadwick et al .",
    "the tev production could come from a beam of relativistic hadrons interacting with ejected matter clumps from the companion star ( aharonian & atoyan 1996b ) .",
    "recent reanalysis of the tev data does suggest some modulation of the tev emission with the pulsar half - period from one night ( atoyan et al .",
    "2002 ) for higher energy events . in general",
    ", the lack of modulation could point to a large scale source region , quite distant from the neutron star and atoyan et al . also consider electronic ic components and possible ways to discriminate them from the hadronic scenario .",
    "+ _ * tev  j2032 + 4130 : * _ discovered seredipitously in hegra iact - system data ( aharonian et al . 2002 ; rowell et al . 2003 ) , tev  j2032 + 4130 is at present the only unidentified tev source .",
    "despite the fact that no multiwavelength counterpart is identified , its location within the extremely dense ob association cygnus  ob2 cluster could point to particle acceleration in such environments .",
    "alternative explanations invoke a jet - powered microquasar scenario , for example a link to nearby cygnus x-3 , the egret source 3e2033 + 4118 , or even an unseen plerion .",
    "the lack of an x - ray counterpart could suggest a hadronic source and deeper x - ray observations of the cygnus ob2 region are in the pipeline ( butt et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the discovery of tev  j2032 + 4130 is in fact a perfect example of the survey capabilities of present ground - based instruments , particularly those utilising large fields of view and achieving arc - minute source location error boxes .",
    "overall , the interpretion of the galactic tev sources has invoked both the hadronic and electronic models . except for the crab ,",
    "which is quite well understood in terms of the electronic synchrotron / ic framework , solid discrimination between the hadronic and electronic framework requires more accurate tev spectral information covering a broader energy range , coupled with multiwavelength studies . in some cases the high resolution results from",
    "_ chandra _ are certainly helping to constrain the electronic component .",
    "so far what is lacking is clear proof that the tev galactic objects are capable of accelerating hadrons to multi - tev energies .",
    "further improvements in sensitivity and energy coverage for ground - based instruments have therefore been sought after during the last 5 years or so . in particular as well as aiming for a decrease in energy threshold to @xmath32 gev , it is now clear that sensitivity improvements at the high energy end @xmath33 tev are are also deemed vital to separating the hadronic from electronic emission processes .",
    "the best ground - based systems operating up until 2002 achieved an angular resolution , energy resolution , energy threshold , and sensitivity of @xmath34 , @xmath3515% , @xmath3250 gev and @xmath36 erg @xmath37 s@xmath38 ( @xmath391 tev , 50 hours , 5@xmath40 ) respectively . this flux sensitivity amounts to @xmath35 to 10@xmath40 / @xmath41 on the crab . the so - called _ next generation _ instruments in ground - based @xmath0-ray astronomy aim to realise roughly one order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity and reduction in energy threshold over present instruments .",
    "four primary projects are now coming online .",
    "the h.e.s.s .",
    ", veritas and cangaroo iii projects are employing the stereoscopic imaging technique .",
    "data analysis techniques will be in general similar to that used by present instruments , in particular the stereoscopic aspects developed with the hegra iact - system .",
    "these systems consist of arrays of @xmath42 telescopes each with @xmath3100 m@xmath43 segmented mirrors and imaging cameras of @xmath44500 pixels subtending @xmath45 fields of view .",
    "all are expected to achieve energy thresholds in the range 50 to 200 gev .",
    "the magic project comprises a single , very large telescope of mirror area ( @xmath15200 m@xmath43 ) in an effort to achieve an energy threshold @xmath46 gev .",
    "extra telescopes may be added to form a stereoscopic system .",
    "figure  [ fig : sensitivities ] compares the sensitivities of present and next - generation ( and beyond ) ground - based instruments along with the next space - based detectors in the high energy regime glast , integral and mega .    as of october 2003 , h.e.s.s .",
    "and cangaroo - iii have a number of telescopes running .",
    "they are expecting completion of their full 4-telescope arrays by 2004 .",
    "veritas has just begun partial operation of their prototype telescope and magic is also nearing completion , already taking engineering data . both h.e.s.s . and",
    "cangaroo are situated in the southern hemisphere and as such are perfectly postitioned to survey the galactic plane for new sources .",
    "searching for high energy counterparts to the numerous egret unidentified sources ( hartman et al .",
    "1999 ) is a prime motivation .",

    "for example is expected to survey the inner plane ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) at the 0.1 crab level in less than 200 hours observation time .",
    "is also presently devoting large effort to confirmation of the all of the southern tev sources listed above , all of which require confirmation at solid significance levels similar to early results on the crab for full acceptance in the field .",
    "looking further into the future , already the expansion of h.e.s.s .",
    "and the like is under full consideration .",
    "several options ere now being considered as to how to improve the energy coverage and sensitivities even further .",
    "one such option given serious thought is the placement of a telescope at high mountain altitude @xmath49 m to approach the lowest possible threshold allowed by the technique @xmath50 gev .",
    "the 5@5 proposal ( aharonian et al .",
    "2001b ) considers placing a h.e.s.s .- like system ( slightly bigger telescopes ) at the alma site in chile ( 5000 m ) .",
