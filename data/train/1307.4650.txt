    "the quantization of this model and the renormalization of related scalar field models has been discussed over the last fifteen years , see for instance reference  @xcite for a brief review and list of references . in the latter work it was pointed out that the usual bphz momentum space subtraction scheme ( which consists of subtracting appropriate polynomials in the external momentum from the integrand of divergent integrals ) can not be applied in non - commutative theories , e.g. for an integral of the form @xmath14[k^2+m^2 ] }   \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the problem is due to the phase factor @xmath15 which is at the origin of the uv / ir mixing problem , i.e. the appearance of an ir - singularity for small values of the external momentum @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , a modified subtraction scheme was proposed in reference  @xcite : it consists of considering @xmath16 and @xmath17 as independent variables ( though satisfying @xmath18 ) when performing the subtraction , i.e. one subtracts from the integrand its taylor series expansion with respect to the external momentum @xmath16 around @xmath19 up to the order of divergence of the graph , while maintaining the phase factors : thus , for the integral ( [ 4pfct ] ) one considers @xmath20[k^2+m^2 ] } - \\frac{\\cos(k{\\tilde{p}})}{[k^2+m^2]^2 } \\right )   \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by proceeding in this way , the one - loop renormalization of the theory could be carried out for the so - called nave @xmath0-theory described by the action ( [ action ] ) as well as for this action supplemented by a @xmath21-term which is known to overcome the uv / ir mixing problem while maintaining the translation invariance of the model  @xcite .",
    "part of the present work concerns the application of the modified subtraction scheme to higher - loop graphs involving overlapping divergences . for concreteness",
    ", we will investigate in detail the _ sunrise graph _ as an example for a two - loop graph with overlapping divergences . to tackle this problem",
    ", we apply the so - called forest formula of zimmermann  @xcite in the non - commutative setting using the modified subtraction scheme .    in this context",
    ", it is worthwhile recalling that an open problem in non - commutative field theories is that there exists no proof for the renormalizability of the proposed classical gauge field models .",
    "indeed , the methods considered so far for the quantization of scalar field theories on non - commutative space ( such as multi - scale analysis ) can not be applied , or at least not without some serious complications , to gauge field theories due to the fact that they break the gauge symmetry .",
    "this is a strong impetus for trying to generalize to the non - commutative setting the approach of bphz which does not require the introduction of a regularization and which has been proven to be a powerful tool for field theories with local symmetries on commutative space , e.g. see references  @xcite . with this motivation in mind and in order to present a self - contained treatment of the sunrise - graph",
    ", we provide a short introduction to the bphz - approach to renormalization in section  [ sec : nutshell ] before treating the sunrise - graph of non - commutative @xmath22-theory in section  [ sec : ffphase ] and discussing ir - singularities in section  [ irsingularities ] .",
    "we conclude with some comments on gauge theories and the issues to be addressed in future work .",
    "in this section we present a sketch of the _ bphz ( bogoliubov , parasiuk , hepp , zimmermann ) method of renormalization _ in euclidean @xmath23 which is based on some ideas put forward by stueckelberg and green  @xcite .",
    "the original references are  @xcite@xcite@xcite and the approach has been conveniently reformulated by zimmermann  @xcite , different aspects being discussed in references  @xcite .",
    "the bphz approach to the perturbative renormalization of field theory amounts to a proper definition of the quantum theory and essentially consists of three ingredients :    1 .   a _ subtraction scheme _",
    ", i.e a systematic procedure for subtracting an overall ultraviolet divergence as well as subdivergences ( i.e. divergences of subdiagrams ) from any feynman integral ( 1pi ( one - particle - irreducible ) graph or function ) in order to get a finite ( convergent ) expression for this integral .",
    "2 .   a _ proof of the locality of these subtractions _ , i.e. a proof that these subtractions correspond to the addition of local counterterms to the lagrangian having the same form as those in the original lagrangian and  [ ncgt ] , this condition obviously has to be relaxed since the star product introduces a certain type of non - localities , see ref .",
    ". however , the condition that the counterterms have the same form as those in the original lagrangian still applies  see also the discussion in section  [ sec : modifiedbphz ] . ]",
    "( compatibility with additive renormalization ) .",
    "3 .   a set of _ normalization conditions _ on the 1pi functions involving divergences in order to fix the physical parameters ( masses , coupling constants ,  ) of the theory .",
    "these conditions can be achieved by the addition of finite counterterms to the lagrangian .",
    "if the initial lagrangian has some rigid or local _ symmetries _ , these also have to be taken into account , i.e. the counterterms have to be invariant ( and if a regularization is chosen for performing the subtractions , it has to respect the symmetries ) . a systematic method for implementing this program is provided by the method of _ algebraic renormalization _  @xcite .    in the bphz approach",
    ", the subtraction of divergences can be performed by considering a particular regularization ( such as dimensional regularization ) or without using such a regularization ( momentum space subtraction in the integrands of feynman integrals ) .",
    "the latter approach allows to treat in particular field theories for which no invariant regulator is known .    in the bphz method , the systematic subtraction of subdivergences for a given graph",
    "is realized by zimmermann s _ forest formula _ which yields finite ( i.e. renormalized ) feynman integrals .",
    "the fact that the latter formula represents a solution of the _ recursion relation _ for bogoliubov s _ @xmath24-operation _ allows to prove inductively the locality of the subtractions .",
    "thus , the bphz approach to renormalization is equivalent to the familiar method based on counterterms .",
    "different renormalization schemes are always related by a finite renormalization .",
