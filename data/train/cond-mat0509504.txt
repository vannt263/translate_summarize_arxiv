    "in spite of more than thirty years of studies of superfluid phases of @xmath0he , there are several active research directions .",
    "one of them is the study of josephson phenomena in weak links between two volumes of bulk superfluid .",
    "here we give a review of recent theoretical work on this subject @xcite .",
    "we pay special attention to the role of bound quasiparticle states in the link , and explain how these determine the flow through the junction .",
    "in particular we study the equilibrium current  phase relation , @xmath2 , and the dc current at constant potential difference , @xmath3 .",
    "we compare the results with experiments .",

    "`` superfluid '' means generally a fermion superfluid , either superconducting metal or liquid @xmath0he .",
    "our discussion of superconducting weak links is mainly aimed as an introduction for @xmath0he .",
    "therefore we neglect all complications that arise from impurity or interfacial scattering in superconductors . also we consider only superconductors of the conventional ( s - wave ) type . in the case of",

    "when its energy is within the energy gap , the quasiparticle can not escape to the bulk but is andreev reflected as hole with essentially the same momentum .",
    "this in turn is andreev reflected as particle on the other side of the link .",
    "thus particle and hole type excitations bounce back and forth along the same trajectory .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    the figure shows one quasiparticle trajectory with momentum @xmath5 . in bulk superfluid such elementary excitations must have energy @xmath6 larger than the energy gap @xmath7 of the superfluid . in the weak link , however , there exists energy eigenvalues within the energy gap , @xmath8 .",
    "in such a state the quasiparticle can not escape to the bulk but is andreev reflected .",
    "in andreev reflection a particle type excitation is converted to hole type and vice versa , with essentially unchanged momentum @xcite .",
    "thus the particles and holes travel the same trajectory back and forth , respectively . in one cycle , one cooper pair , or equivalently two particles , are transmitted through the weak link .",
    "the bulk superfluid states are characterized by phases @xmath9 and @xmath4 .",
    "the energies of the bound states depend essentially on the phase difference @xmath10 @xcite . for superconductors",

    "the states at energies @xmath14 form a continuum.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the states appear as pairs with positive and negative energies , @xmath15 . understanding that @xmath16 plays a similar role as the group velocity , we can assign the states as propagating to the right ( @xmath12 ) and to the left ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "these two states are not independent , however .",
    "based on what was stated about andreev reflection above , if a state with @xmath18 is occupied , the corresponding @xmath19 state must be empty . and vice versa . more generally , the occupations @xmath20 have to satisfy @xmath21 .",
    "really the states with positive and negative energies are the same bound state , whose energy relative to the ground state is the absolute value @xmath22 .",
    "anyhow , we find it very useful to consider a bound state as a superposition of positive and negative energy states .    in the simplest case of a point contact , the bound state energies have the simple analytic expression @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "by a point contact , or a pinhole in case of @xmath0he , we mean a weak link whose all dimensions are small compared to the superfluid coherence length @xmath24 .",
    "it is an interesting observation that to a large extent the current through a weak link is determined by the bound states @xcite . in the following we are interested in equilibrium or only small nonequilibrium , where the chemical potential difference @xmath25 . in this case",
    "the current has the form @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the occupation of the state . in equilibrium",

    "the current is @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "kulik and omelyanchuk derived in 1975 the following formula for equilibrium current trough a superconducting point contact @xcite @xmath34 their original derivation does not give much clue to understand the result .",
    "now this result can be straightforwardly understood based on the formulas given above : all channels have the same bound state energies @xmath23 and using the current formula ( [ e.cursc ] ) and the fermi distribution gives the result ( [ e.ko ] ) .    as the temperature increases towards the superfluid transition temperature @xmath35 ,",
    "the kulik - omelyanchuk result ( [ e.ko ] ) reduces to sinusoidal form @xmath36 with critical current @xmath37 .",
    "most of the discussion of superconducting weak links applies also to weak links in @xmath0he .",
    "there are a few differences . in @xmath0he",
    "the cooper pairs are in p - wave states , instead of the s - wave state considered above .",
    "any scattering breaks these pairs .",

    "this suppression also affects the bound states energies in a weak link , as depicted in fig.[diffusedos ] .",
    "[ diffusedos ]   in a @xmath0he weak link .",
    "compared to figure [ diffusedossc ] , the bound state energies have smaller slopes and they are spin split ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "figure reprinted from ref .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    compared to the superconducting case , the slopes @xmath16 are smaller in magnitude .",
    "another difference is that there is spin splitting of the energy states ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "whereas the states in the superconducting case were doubly degenerate , this degeneracy is generally broken in @xmath0he .    because of the spin splitting",
    "the current formula ( [ e.cursc ] ) has to be generalized to the form @xmath39 where a factor of 2 is replaced by spin summation .",
    "there is also additional summation over index @xmath40 , which takes into account that several bound states can occur at a given @xmath11 .",
    "the spin splitting can lead to current  phase relationships that differ essentially from the standard sinusoidal form ( [ e.sinsoid ] ) @xcite .",
    "consider , for example , the case where the spin split states are shifted relative to each other by a phase difference @xmath41 .",
    "it follows that the leading sinusoidal components of the current from the two spin states [ @xmath42 cancel each other .",
    "what is then left are higher harmonics [ @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "unusual current  phase relations are confirmed by calculations below .",

    "we concentrate on the b - phase , where @xmath45 pairs have the first spin state , @xmath46 pairs the second and @xmath47 pairs the third .",
    "however , the spin coordinate axes ( @xmath51 ) are rotated relative to the orbital axes ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the rotation angle is fixed to @xmath53 , but the axis @xmath54 of this rotation can vary .    in hydrodynamics of the b phase the mass ( @xmath11 ) and spin ( @xmath54 ) degrees of freedom are independent .",

    "2 ) the theoretical @xmath1 state occurs at a much lower temperature and is much weaker than in experiments ( compare figs.[pinholecp3b ] and [ berkeleypi ] ) .",
    "3 ) the theory does not predict any difference in @xmath3 between the h and l states .",
    "this is because different @xmath54 configurations mainly shift the bound states energies @xmath72 along the @xmath11 axis but do not much affect the shape of the @xmath73 curves .",
    "in running @xmath11 this only affects the instantaneous current @xmath74 , but the average @xmath66 is unchanged .",
    "all the problems above can be explained by a single new concept .",
    "if the josephson coupling is strong , it can change the spin - part of the order parameter on both sides .",
    "we call this _ anisotextural _ effect , since the @xmath54 orientations are commonly known as texture .",

    "then there is no spin splitting and the bound state at phase difference @xmath56 lies at zero energy , @xmath75 .",
    "the thermal occupation of this doubly degenerate state is @xmath76 .",
    "if we now allow spin splitting , the @xmath75 state can split into two with positive and negative energies ( fig .",
    "[ diffusedos ] ) .",
    "taking into account that the occupation of the negative energy state is larger than that of the positive energy state , this leads to a reduction of energy .",

    "the radiated power has the frequency dependence @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the radius of the josephson array , and @xmath93 the spin wave velocity .",
    "this expresses that there is little radiation for wave lengths longer than the source , but more at shorter wave lengths .",
    "the dissipated power now has to come from the dc current , @xmath94 .",
    "thus there is additional dc current due to the spin wave radiation . including also the prefactors we get for it the expression @xmath95",

    "most interestingly , this coupling is different for the theoretical h and l states . putting in numbers we see that the theory explains approximately one third of the observed h - l difference shown in fig.[berkeleypi ] .",
    "( the comparison is shown in ref .",
    ") this is not completely satisfactory , but we must remember that all parameters of the theory were fixed before the comparison .",
    "models to explain the observed @xmath3 have also been suggested in ref .",
    "these models differ essentially from the present ones .",
    "in particular , an a - phase - like distortion of the order parameter is associated with the linear part and a quasiparticle radiation mechanism with the nonlinear part of @xmath3 .",
    "we have seen that coupling between mass and spin variables is essential for understanding the josephson phenomena in superfluid @xmath0he . with spin splitting of bound states together with the anisotextural effect it is possible to explain most of the experimental results of both @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the theory presented above uses the pinhole approximation . for more accurate results it is necessary to consider larger apertures",
    "this would require selfconsistent determination of the order parameter within the aperture , which is calculationally demanding and has been done only in limiting cases @xcite .",
    "we expect that this might lead to qualitatively same type of results as the anisotextural effect for pinhole arrays , in particular , to enhanced @xmath1 states and to a texture dependence of @xmath3 .",
