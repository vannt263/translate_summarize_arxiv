    "we consider a scalar field theory described by the action @xmath3 in euclidean space , where @xmath4 is a complex @xmath5 matrix .",
    "the action ( [ action ] ) is invariant under a @xmath6 ( to be taken @xmath7 ) symmetry , under the global symmetry transformation @xmath8 , where @xmath9 are @xmath10 matrices .",
    "this model has been considered as a low - energy effective theory to describe the strong - coupling extended technicolor models and top - condensate models of electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "this model , in contrast to the @xmath11 model , is known to possess for @xmath12 a first order phase transition whose strength varies in the @xmath13 space .",
    "this is due to the well - known coleman - weinberg instability @xcite , and it places restrictions on the allowed parameter space of couplings . as one adjusts @xmath14 past a critical value , @xmath15 , the vacuum expectation value ( v.e.v . ) @xmath16 jumps discontinuously from zero in the unbroken phase to some finite nonzero value in the broken phase .",
    "then , if the model is to be a valid low - energy effective theory , relevant to continuum physics , the couplings @xmath17 , should belong to a region where the phase transition is sufficiently weak first order .",
    "it is only then that @xmath16 can be small compared to the cut - off @xmath18 .",
    "the model ( [ action ] ) has been studied in perturbation theory , in terms of the effective potential and the renormalization group ( rg ) in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the language of rg flows and its associated fixed points @xcite in @xcite .",
    "a preliminary investigation on the lattice was undertaken in ref .",
    "we present here a more complete investigation of the phase structure of the @xmath19 model , by performing monte carlo simulations of the lattice regularized version of the action ( [ action ] ) above .",
    "in the sequel we take @xmath7 , so the action ( [ action ] ) depends on eight degrees of freedom .",
    "more details about the model can be found in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath20 , then the symmetry is enhanced to @xmath21 ( @xmath22 for general @xmath23 ) . the pattern of symmetry breaking depends on the sign of @xmath24 . if @xmath25 then the breaking occurs according to @xmath26 resulting in four goldstone bosons , while if @xmath27 , the symmetry breaking pattern is that of @xmath28 resulting in five goldstone bosons .    [ traj ]    fig .",
    "( [ traj ] ) displays the rg flows , at one - loop ( solid lines ) and two - loop ( dash lines ) level , within renormalized perturbation theory .",
    "then , starting from bare couplings @xmath29 , if @xmath12 all rg flows in the infrared intersect the `` stability line '' @xcite , eventually becoming runaway trajectories .",
    "the phase transition is then of first order @xcite . for @xmath24 small ,",
    "though , the flow is rather slow and even though the `` stability line '' is crossed , this happens after many decades of running ; the phase transition is , in this case , weakly first order , with @xmath30 . along the @xmath20 axis",
    "the transition is known to be second order , and the well known triviality analysis @xcite applies .",
    "the two - loop corrections seem to improve the hierarchy @xmath31 , as found also in @xcite .",
    "in particular , there exists a region with @xmath32 where the flow is towards larger values and it appears that it never crosses the stability line .",
    "however , this only hints upon the breakdown of perturbation theory and a nonperturbative analysis is called for .",
    "it is also essential that no other fixed point , unreachable in perturbation theory , exists .",
    "should one be present , the rg trajectories would be distorted and there could be regions where the transition is second order .",
    "we found no evidence of such a fixed point .    on the lattice ,",
    "the physical parameter controlling the running of the couplings and hence the size of the corrections is the correlation length @xmath33 of the system .",
    "then one expects that @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the appropriate critical exponent : a large hierarchy will only be possible if @xmath33 is big , or equivalently , that the transition is weakly first order or second order .",
    "= ?    .estimates of the jump in the order parameter @xmath36 evaluated at the critical point @xmath37 , and of the correlation length estimated by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the smallest lattice where coexistence was found , or from the effective potential . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table i shows all the points in the ( bare ) coupling constant space at which we performed monte carlo simulations .",
    "we used two different programs checked against each other : one based on a simple one - hit metropolis algorithm with a uniform step tuned so that the acceptance rate is about 60@xmath40 and the other based on the hybrid algorithm ( with or without fourier acceleration ) . in this latter method ,",
    "two parameters have to be chosen , namely the number of leap - frog steps and the step size .",
    "this allows better control of the autocorrelation time .",
    "we found optimal cpu performance for 5 - 8 leap - frog steps before each metropolis test .",
    "the hybrid one performed clearly better .",
    "we used as an order parameter ( following @xcite ) the expectation value of the @xmath41 invariant operator @xmath42 which corresponds to the susceptibility , where @xmath43 is the lattice average of each field component .",
    "@xmath44 is proportional to @xmath36 in the broken phase and zero in the unbroken phase , modulo finite size corrections .",
    "we used lattices of sizes ranging from @xmath45 to @xmath46 . in order to obtain information about the order of the transition , at each given ( @xmath47 ) we searched for hysteresis effects in the measurement of the order parameter by performing thermal cycles in the relevant parameter , @xmath14 , across the critical region .",
    "strong hysteresis loops is an indication of a strong first order transition .    on smaller lattices , ( @xmath48 ) ,",
    "the critical region was identified by searching for a double - peak signal in the histogram distribution of @xmath49 .",
    "we then moved to bigger lattices ( @xmath50 ) to look for coexistence . along the process of increasing the lattice size",
    "we eventually begin to see metastability at some size @xmath39 .",
    "we estimate then the correlation length to be @xmath51 .",
    "crude as this procedure may seem , it is physically meaningful and it agrees , where comparison is possible , with the effective potential .",
    "our results are as follows .",
    "all points close to the stability line exhibited marked hysteresis loops and hence show strong first order transitions , becoming stronger as we move up along the stability line .",
    "for such couplings , @xmath52 so the cut - off effects are big and the connection to continuum physics questionable . in the weak coupling region ( @xmath53 ) , we also computed the one - loop bare effective potential @xcite and found that it agreed with the numerical data within @xmath54 .",
    "next we investigated couplings along the @xmath24 axis .",
    "typically , runs on @xmath55 lattices did not show any hysteresis effects .",
    "however we found clear sign of the existence of two minima on @xmath56 lattices .",
    "( [ fig08l10 ] ) displays tunneling between two phases for the point ( 0 , 8) on a @xmath57 lattice . for the same point ,",
    "clear signal was found of two coexistent minima on the @xmath58 lattice , but no tunneling was observed .",
    "the transition becomes stronger with increasing @xmath24 .",
    "for points deep in the @xmath59 region , we were able to observe coexistence of phases , but only on @xmath60 lattices .",
    "the transition is always clearly first order , but characterized by correlation lengths , as expected , larger than those obtained close to the stability line . for couplings close to the @xmath61 axis , our numerical results are in agreement with the expectation of the rg for a weak first order transition . in this case , though , it is difficult to distinguish a weak first order from a second order transition .",
    "our results are summarized in table  ( [ table ] ) . from these",
    ", one can see that in most of parameter space the v.e.v .",
    ", @xmath62 , is typically only one order of magnitude smaller than the cut - off .",
    "our results are consistent with the standard perturbative picture of first order phase transitions and the absence of any nontrivial fixed point .",
    "the hierarchy @xmath31 is not `` tunable '' by @xmath14 as in the @xmath11 model , but rather depends on @xmath24 .",
    "phenomenologically viable models must lead to couplings with small @xmath24 in order to support a large hierarchy ."
