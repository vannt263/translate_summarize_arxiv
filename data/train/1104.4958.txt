    "one feature common to both pqcd tomography and gravity dual holography is that both predict the energy loss per unit length , @xmath67 , increases monotonically with the plasma density or temperature . in this section",
    "we consider a generic analytic energy loss that can interpolate between a wide range of dynamical scenarios and provide qualitative understanding of the quantitative numerical whdg results presented in section [ section : quant ] .",

    "because @xmath86 in the range @xmath87 , we can simulate pqcd light quark jet energy dependence with @xmath88 .",
    "the density dependence is then roughly linear with @xmath89 in the static case .",

    "in addition , the reduction of the fractional energy loss with increasing @xmath1 with @xmath97 causes @xmath103 to rise with @xmath1 at lhc while at rhic the @xmath1 dependent increase of the spectral index compensates this natural rise .",

    "second , observables such as @xmath64once the reference opacity is fixed  are found numerically not to depend much on the specifics of the explored collinear approximation uncertainty @xcite .",
    "the theoretical systematic uncertainties of the elastic energy loss contributions are less well known and call for more scrutiny . in @xcite it was shown that , contrary to often assumed multi soft gaussian transverse elastic diffusion approximation , the large momentum transfer power law tails with @xmath181 gev momentum exchange ( as included in whdg through the @xmath182 enhancement of elastic energy loss ) , can not be ignored as assumed in many other models . in order to quantify the size of this collinear radiation approximation systematic uncertainty we use the inelastic energy loss formula derived in minkowski",
    "coordinates and take the maximum angle of emission for radiation to be @xmath183 ( for a more detailed discussion , see @xcite ) .",
    "the best fit value for the average medium density constrained by central rhic data is @xmath184 @xcite , which extrapolates to @xmath185 .",
    "the purple curves in and denoted by `` @xmath186 '' in shows the values of @xmath187 that result . that the curve lies within the whdg uncertainty blue band due to the 1-@xmath33 medium parameter extraction at rhic confirms that the systematic theoretical uncertainty due to the collinear approximation is small for at lhc once the medium parameter is fixed to rhic data",
    "; in particular , the whdg predictions and the alice data are in quantitative tension within the combined experimental and currently quantitatively explored theoretical uncertainties .      continuing with the assumption that the qgp medium density scales with the number of charged hadrons we may make another _ constrained prediction _ from whdg for the of the 70 - 80% centrality class . from the alice centrality - dependent multiplicity data @xcite we find that @xmath188 , and @xmath189 for the @xmath186 calculation . these are admittedly very small densities distributed over a small region , and it is not clear that a qgp medium forms in these highly peripheral heavy ion collisions .",

    "we plot both the experimental values and our calculation in .",
    "care was taken to propagate the relative systematic and statistical errors in quadrature .",
    "some component of the systematic uncertainty shown in the original alice figures @xcite is due to a -dependent uncertainty from the unknown p + p reference spectrum , which cancels in the @xmath190 ratio .",
    "the alice paper @xcite quotes the systematic uncertainties not due to the p + p spectrum as 5 - 7% and 8 - 10% in the central and peripheral bins , respectively . as a conservative estimate",
    "we take the upper values and add ( in quadrature ) the relative uncertainty due to the normalization ; this procedure yields a systematic uncertainty of 15% , represented by the gray bands in .",
    "again the light blue band represents the theoretical uncertainty due to the extraction of the medium density at rhic , with the dashed blue curve representing the best fit value , and the thin purple curve represents the result when using the @xmath186 calculation discussed above .",
    "the theoretical calculation reproduces the observed -dependence of quite well .",
    "the theory results are systematically about 2 standard deviations of systematic uncertainty below the data ; however one should note that much of this systematic error is correlated and -independent , and a smaller peripheral , as suggested by the results from an optical glauber calculation , would yield an experimental suppression significantly closer to our prediction .",
    "precise observations of direct photons and z bosons should help reduce this possible extra uncertainty on the number of binary collisions in highly peripheral events .",
    "additionally , that the optical glauber results deviate so significantly from the monte carlo results in the 70 - 80% centrality bin provides a quantitative feel for the importance of geometry fluctuations for these highly peripheral collisions ; these possibly large geometry fluctuations are not taken into account in the energy loss calculations presented here .",
    "nevertheless , we find that this large discrepancy is a challenge to the pqcd paradigm assumed by the whdg energy loss calculation .",

    "the thin purple curve represents the result when using the @xmath186 prescription and an extrapolation of @xmath196 .",
    "we note that these constrained predictions for 5.5 atev are qualitatively similar but differ in detail from our earlier 2007 predictions that assumed a smaller medium density range , @xmath197 @xcite .",

    "the whdg model includes both radiative and collisional channels and jet path length fluctuations .",
    "we found that at the momentum range currently probed at lhc , collisional energy loss is as important as radiative energy loss and can not be neglected .",
    "previous work @xcite showed that even at top lhc energies and @xmath198 gev , elastic energy loss makes up a sizable fraction , @xmath199 , of the total energy loss in the htl pqcd picture of the sqgp .",
    "the results we present assume that the htl qgp medium density scales with the global charged particle multiplicity .",
    "our results are true predictions based on rigorous statistical constraints of the medium density using whdg at rhic to the qgp conditions at 2.76 central pb+pb as constrained by global @xmath200 from alice : _ there are no free parameters_. while unconstrained models without elastic energy and path length fluctuations can fit any by adjusting the opacity , consistency with extensive rhic jet quenching data leads in whdg to a prediction of overquenching relative to the first alice data .",
    "central and peripheral @xmath201 at @xmath193 tev from the whdg energy loss model . ]",
    "we find that our results show a qualitative agreement with the momentum dependence of the central alice data and a quantitative agreement with the normalization and -dependence of the peripheral alice results , within the reported uncertainties . under our assumption of the scaling of the medium density ,",
    "though , we find a quantitative disagreement with the normalization of the suppression for the reported central values of the alice data for 0 - 5% central pb + pb collisions .",
    "unfortunately , the very large systematic uncertainty in the alice data due to the unmeasured base p + p reference precludes strong conclusions at this time .",
    "our calculated is free from this normalization ambiguity , but the experimental systematic error is dominated by it , and our predictions for central are not in disagreement with the data within this large systematic uncertainty . only a p + p run at @xmath17 tev at lhc will resolve this uncertainty .    in order to reduce systematic uncertainties , we therefore compared within the whdg framework .",
    "an analysis from alice was not released yet , and therefore we calculated this quantity from the available results including propagating the reported uncertainties .    the whdg results for also show qualitative agreement with the -dependent shape of the data , although the whdg calculations seem to somewhat under - predict the slope for the central and peripheral @xmath202 individually . on the other hand ,",
    "since our central calculations are more suppressed than the data while the peripheral results compare favorably , our results also over - suppress the data .",
    "this disagreement is at about the 2-@xmath33 level compared to the 15% systematic error we estimate from the alice data .",
    "much of the 15% systematic uncertainty is due to the normalization of and is therefore -independent and correlated , reducing the tension between the experimental results and the theoretical predictions .",
    "it is also worth noting again that the used by alice differs significantly from that given by an optical glauber calculation .",
    "our results would compare more favorably with the data if the optical glauber calculation would be used .",
    "precise experimental measurements of probes that interact only weakly with the qgp plasma , such as direct photons or z bosons , is the only way of experimentally constraining the normalization used in and analyses . z bosons will give a much cleaner picture as photons are created not only directly in the initial hard scatterings but also via photon bremsstrahlung @xcite .    as hard photons and",
    "z bosons come from quark  anti - quark annihilation , a measurement of @xmath203 or @xmath204 less than 1 could be interpreted as due to either a reduction in the expected number of binary collisions or the reduction in the availability of anti - quarks due to gluon saturation .",
    "in particular there are predictions of a reduction by @xmath205 in the initial hard spectra at the momenta currently observed at lhc due to gluon saturation effects @xcite ; this reduction would naturally decrease as a function of as @xmath206 increases .",
    "as such , the -dependence of the alice data may be due , at least in part , to initial state effects .",
    "a precise measurement of @xmath203 or @xmath204 showing the -independence of these ratios would be required to demonstrate the lack of strong initial state shadowing in the @xmath42 and @xmath43 gev@xmath44 range relevant to the present alice data in the @xmath112 gev range ( as expected from , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "p + a collisions would provide a superb independent test of the possible influence of gluon saturation , similar to the crucial d + a collisions needed at rhic to disentangle initial state from final state effects .",
    "since there are no adjustable parameters for us , the significant tension between our results and the alice data is a failure to _ simultaneously _ describe the normalizations of both the rhic and lhc .",
    "one possibility is the sqgp produced at lhc is in fact more transparent than predicted by perturbative qcd tomographic models with medium densities that scale with observed particle rapidity densities .",
    "theoretical possibilities that could contribute to the apparent transparency ( decreased opacity ) of the sqgp relative to the whdg extrapolation from rhic to lhc include    1 .",

    "item 2 , in which the bremsstrahlung emitted gluons are kept track of and produce observed hadrons , may be a partial explanation , but estimates so far have neglected the energy loss of the radiated gluons themselves . radiated gluons with formation length less than the size of the medium could also be strongly quenched .",
    "a detailed centrality dependence of the di - hadron correlations may be able to resolve such nonlinear gluon shower feedback mechanisms .",
    "item 3 is possible channel that can effectively reduce the gluon jet color charge for asymmetric ( @xmath209 ) @xmath210 conversion .",
    "however , estimates@xcite so far have neglected strong interference effects of medium and vacuum induced amplitudes in finite size plasmas and high @xmath1 octet color coherence of pair production .",
    "jet flavor triggers that could discriminate light quark and gluon jets are needed to determine experimentally if this mechanism is responsible for the apparent transparency of the sqgp at lhc .",

    "item 5 refers to the possibility that the surprisingly transparent sqgp at rhic could be due a reduction of the effective jet - medium coupling between rhic and lhc . in the whdg analysis here",
    ", we assumed @xmath211 is the same at rhic and lhc and the difference only reflects the increase of the initial sqgp density by 2.2 . in @xcite",
    "an average path length approximation using glv @xcite was used to show that approximately the same effective opacity @xmath212 can fit both rhic and lhc . in the htl approximation @xmath213 up to slowly varying logarithmic corrections , so at @xmath214 constant implies @xmath215 is reduced by a factor of @xmath216 .",
    "however , in @xcite @xmath174 was assumed to be constant and @xmath73 varied . in whdg",
    "the effective l is completely fixed the distribution of path lengths . as @xmath217 and @xmath218 the theoretical calculation of suppression depends very strongly on the specific value of @xmath219 taken .",
    "a fit , i.e.  a postdiction to the lhc data , can be achieved in whdg by making the coupling a free parameter and reducing it from the @xmath174 that we take in this analysis ; we refrain from such uncontrolled fitting in this paper . a quantitative estimate of the effect of allowing the coupling to run , and",
    "therefore possibly be smaller at lhc than at rhic , requires higher order theoretical derivations that do not currently exist ; in fact , even the qualitative result of such higher order effects are difficult to estimate as radiative energy loss calculations always include soft exchanges between the leading parton and the medium particles that , in principle can only be handled by nonperturbative techniques . while one hopes that these higher order effects become small at higher leading parton momentum , there is always in heavy ion problems a temperature scale @xmath220 which is the same order of magnitude as @xmath221 .",
    "in particular , factorization has never been proven for energy loss calculations in heavy ion collisions .",
    "could jet coupling to the sqgp at lhc be in fact more weakly coupled than at rhic ? from the near equality of bulk differentail elliptic flow , @xmath222 , the answer would appear to be no .",
    "however , for short wavelengths @xmath123 gev jet probes the effective jet medium coupling could in fact be smaller at lhc than at rhic .",
    "the key observable to test this possibility may be the high @xmath1 elliptic and higher flow moments@xcite , @xmath223 .",
    "this observable remains a key stumbling block already at rhic for all htl / pqcd based models including whdg that underestimate @xmath224 significantly .",
    "if @xmath223 at lhc turns out to deviate less from whdg  even when @xmath225 is reduced to account for the near identity of rhic and lhc  then a firmer case could be made that the sqgp at lhc is indeed more transparent to jets than expected .",
    "in contrast to the above dynamical effects that could contribute to an apparent reduction in opacity at lhc relative to our whdg expected growth @xmath226 , there are other dynamical effects neglected in our whdg analysis that could contribute to an apparent enhancement of the sqgp opacity at lhc :    1 .",

    "cross correlating light and heavy quark flavor jet quenching systematics would provide quantitative insight into the potential influence of items 2 and 3 .",
    "there are several other possible sources of uncertainty that we did not address here .",
    "for instance one might expect that the energy loss in confined matter would reflect the different properties of a hadronic medium as compared to a deconfined plasma of quarks and gluons @xcite .",
    "presumably , though , the cold matter energy loss would be smaller than hot , and this would lead to a greater discrepancy with the data . additionally , the ordering of length scales @xmath227 assumed in the dglv energy loss derivations is violated for short length paths that may contribute more substantially to the hadrons that are ultimately observed at lhc as compared to rhic due to the significantly more dense medium .",
    "data from additional centrality classes will help clarify the possible role of final state confined matter effects and length scale ordering dependencies .",
    "we also mentioned previously that better calculations of the elastic energy loss of partons exist and can additionally be improved on . aside from the open physics issues listed above ,",
    "there is a continuing need to improve numerical evaluation algorithms to remove simplifying numerical approximations used in whdg and other tomographic models . due to the above considerations , experimental measurements of observables out to very high , for which we demand that theoretical calculations provide a consistent picture of both the mono- and di - jet data ,",
