    "it was shown that depending on the specificity of metric in some cases the spinor field nonlinearity and the mass terms vanish all together , whereas in other cases both the mass term and nonlinear term do not only disappear but also play a crucial role in the evolution of the universe . in a recent paper @xcite it",
    "was found that within the scope of a lrs bianchi type - i spacetime the spinor field nonlinearity depending on the sign of self - coupling constant allows either an expansion with acceleration or an oscillatory mode of evolution of the universe . in this note",
