    "we would like to emphasize that we are able to give explicit monodromy factorizations of the above fibrations although we only give a procedure to get such factorizations without explicitly showing them .",
    "the rest of this section , we give some background on theorem  [ thm3 ] and  [ thm2 ] .         the reason that we focus on lefschetz fibrations that have @xmath1-sections is that they play an important role as follows .",
    "blowing up at the base loci of a genus-@xmath3 lefschetz pencil yields a genus-@xmath3 lefschetz fibration with @xmath1-sections , and conversely , blowing down of @xmath1-sections of a genus-@xmath3 lefschetz fibration gives a genus-@xmath3 lefschetz pencil .",
