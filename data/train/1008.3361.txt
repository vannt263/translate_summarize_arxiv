    "be / x - ray binaries ( bexrbs ) are systems in which a compact object orbits a massive , early type star that at some stage has shown evidence of line emission in the balmer series .",
    "these stars are main sequence stars with a luminosity class of iii to v and as such are a different sub - class of high - mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) to the supergiant systems . to date",
    "there are no bexrbs that contain a confirmed black hole @xcite meaning the detection of pulsed x - ray emission ( caused by the strongly magnetized neutron star ; ns ) is an extremely robust tool for identifying such systems .",
    "the ns accretes via interactions with an extended envelope of material in the equatorial plane of the be star .",
    "these systems typically have wide , eccentric orbits meaning most x - ray outbursts are due to the ns passing through periastron where the density of accretable material is greatest .",
    "these outbursts are denoted type i outbursts and are generally in the luminosity range @xmath4erg s@xmath5 and last from a few days to a few weeks , depending on the binary period of the system .",
    "the less common type ii outbursts are brighter , @xmath6@xmath7erg s@xmath5 , and have no correlation with orbital phase .",
    "the cause of these outbursts is most likely an enlarged circumstellar disk that has grown to encompass part or all of the ns orbit , meaning accretion occurs for prolonged periods ; from several days to a few months ( see @xcite , for further details of these outburst types ) . during phases of accretion",
    ", the pulse period of the pulsar is often seen to decrease , suggesting that large transfer of angular momentum from the companion to the ns is taking place .",
    "this is known as _ spin - up_. this phenomenon can be seen on both long - term ( several years ) and short - term ( several days ) time scales ( e.g. sxp46.6 , sxp144 ; @xcite ) .",
    "long - term changes in spin period are a complex mixture of spin - up from epochs of x - ray activity and spin - down from epochs of x - ray quiescence .",
    "short term changes are most apparant under larger accretion rates and hence , high rates of angular momentum transfer .",
    "therefore , observing these systems during a type ii outburst provides the best data to study accretion driven spin - up .",
    "interactions between the ns and the companion star are clearly important in determining the x - ray activity of any particular system , and so studying the circumstellar disk around the main sequence star is becoming an ever more prominent field of research .",
    "optical monitoring by the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) on the 1.3 m warsaw telescope at las campanas observatory , chile , has provided several years of i - band photometry of magellanic cloud stars .",
    "the relatively cool temperatures of the circumstellar disk in be stars means that this material contributes strongly to the continuum emission in the near infrared ( nir ) .",
    "thus , variability in the ogle light curves of bexrbs is thought to indicate changes in the structure or size of the circumstellar material .",
    "@xcite and @xcite present examples of how flares in the optical light curves of some bexrb systems can be associated with enhanced x - ray activity . in many cases ,",
    "the variability is shown to be periodic or quasi - periodic ; the latter thought to be associated with the growth and decay of the be star s circumstellar disk .",
    "temporal analysis often shows the periodic variability is caused by the presence of a compact object .",
    "the orbital periods of several bexrbs have been discovered , or found to agree with a previously derived x - ray period , in this way ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "variations in the size of the disk can also be studied through h@xmath8 spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite present numerical models of circumstellar disks and show that the strength of the h@xmath8 equivalent width is intrinsically related to the radius of the circumstellar material .",
    "these models rely on several observable parameters including the temperature of the star and the inclination of the disk to the observer ; parameters that are obtainable by knowing the spectral type of the star and from the careful analysis of x - ray data like that outlined above .",
    "the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) is home to nearly 60 bexrb systems @xcite as well as several candidate hmxb systems @xcite .",
    "the system that is the subject of this paper , igr j01054 - 7253 , was discovered as a new x - ray source in the direction of the wing of the smc in june 2009 @xcite .",
    "it was later confirmed as a bexrb system ( see section 2 for details ) . in this paper",
    "we present extensive x - ray and optical data of this xrb .",
    "section 2 gives details of the x - ray observations made and presents x - ray data of the outburst .",
    "section 3 describes the orbital model fitting to several weeks of _ rxte _ data and presents the orbital solution for the system .",
    "section 4 presents optical and ir data of the companion star . in section 5",
    "we use science verification ( sv ) data from the new broadband spectrograph x - shooter on the very large telescope ( vlt ) to spectrally classify the optical counterpart .",
    "section 6 is a discussion of our findings .",
    "we review the implications of the accretion properties and orbital solution in a broader context and discuss what might be happening to the circumstellar disk in this system .",
    "we end with our conclusions in section 7 .",

    "photometric data taken on the irsf and the saao 1.9 m telescope are shown in table [ ta : irsf ] , along with measurements previously published in catalogues .",
    "the irsf magellanic clouds point source catalogue by @xcite was used to calibrate the irsf data .",
    "the magellanic clouds photometric survey ( mcps ) catalogue by @xcite was used to calibrate the 1.9 m optical data .",
    "the optical photometry is not as good as the ir as can be seen from the associated errors .",
    "this is due to the poor seeing at optical wavelengths during the observations , and variability in the conditions during the long integration times required because of a full moon . also , the smaller field of view of the saao ccd compared with the sirius ccd meant there were fewer stars which could be used to perform the calibration .",
    "a pipeline provided by saao was used to calculate the psf magnitude of the optical images after performing flat fielding .",
    "the error is calculated by taking the average of the square of the magnitude errors from the mcps catalogue , for the stars used for calibration , and the standard deviation of the stars from the fitted line .",
    "the final error is @xmath11 .",
    "data from the irsf magellanic clouds point source catalogue and 2mass catalogue @xcite are presented as reference to past ir observations of this source .",
    "unfortunately , the ir data are not directly comparable to the i - band data in the ogle light curve as both measurements fall into gaps in the data and as such we can not say if the nir bands follow what is happening in the i - band",
    ". however , we can make two cautious observations ; firstly , that there is little variation in the j , h & k band values presented in table [ ta : irsf ] and , secondly , that at the time of the sirius catalogue measurement the i - band seems to be much fainter than at the time of the irsf measurement ( assuming the i - band at mjd 53000 is around 15.2 magnitudes in comparison to the present value of 14.6 ) .",
    "this suggests that there may be a change in the ( i - k ) colour in this system .",
    "if true then this is indicative of a changing temperature within the optically thick circumstellar disk .",
    "sxp11.5 was observed during the x - shooter science verification ( sv1 ) phase in august 2009 ( mjd 55055 ; @xmath1210d before the x - ray outburst ended ) , with a total integration time of 1200s . the spectra were reduced with a beta version of the eso x - shooter pipeline @xcite , which uses subtraction of the sky lines based on the procedures developed by @xcite .",
    "the pipeline reduction used calibration spectra taken during the commissioning run for order location and tracing , flat fielding and wavelength calibration .",
    "the final product from the pipeline is an extracted 2d , wavelength calibrated , rectified spectrum with orders combined using a weighting scheme . for further data processing and analysis we used a combination of idl programs and standard iraf tools .",
    "the spectra were then smoothed with a boxcar average of 7 , normalised to remove the continuum and then shifted by 150 km s@xmath5 @xcite to account roughly for the recession velocity of the smc and hence to place spectral features at approximately the correct wavelengths .",
    "these spectra are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : xshoot ] and [ fig : halpha ] .",
    "the uvb arm spectrum is used in the next section to spectrally classify sxp11.5 , whilst the vis arm spectrum is used to measure the h@xmath8 equivalent width just before the outburst came to an end .",
    "this is discussed and compared to a saao h@xmath8 measurement taken months later in section 6 .",
    "classification of galactic be stars relies on using the ratio of many metal - helium lines @xcite .",
    "however , this type of classification , based on the morgan - keenan ( mk ; @xcite ) system , is particularly difficult in the low metallicity environment of the smc because these metal lines are either very weak or not present at all . using high signal - to - noise ratio spectra of smc supergiants",
    ", @xcite devised a system for the classification of stars in the smc that overcomes the problems with low metalicity environments .",
    "this system is ` normalized ' to the mk system such that stars in both systems exhibit the same trends in their line strengths .",
    "another difficulty is that the balmer lines in particular will be rotationally broadened due to the high rotational velocities of be stars and hence may obscure any comparisons to closely neighbouring lines .",
    "we have thus used the classification method as laid out in @xcite and utilised further in @xcite . for the luminosity classification",
    "we have adopted the classification method set out in @xcite .",
    "the classification of sxp11.5 has been made using the x - shooter uvb arm spectrum presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : xshoot ] . immediately obvious is the presence of ionised helium in the spectrum : he ii @xmath134686 , 4541 are present , meaning the spectral type must be b0 or earlier ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "he ii @xmath144200 is weak , and much weaker than he i @xmath144143",
    ", meaning it is later in type than o9 . there may be evidence of some si lines in the spectrum which could stretch the classification to b1 , although these are very difficult to confirm above the general snr of the spectrum . given the presence of he ii @xmath144686 it would seem that , even if the metal lines are supressed by the low metallicity of the smc or masked by rotational broadening of the balmer and helium lines , a spectral type as late as b1 is unlikely .",
    "@xcite also present spectra with apparent si lines and classify them as b0 , indicating that a classification of b0 would be correct in this case if the si lines are present .",
    "given that the metal lines in the spectrum are not so obvious , we were limited to using the he i @xmath144121/he i @xmath144143 ratio to determine the luminosity class @xcite .",
    "this line ratio strengthens towards more luminous stars , suggesting that this star has a luminosity class of iv - v .",
    "we have also performed a check on this luminosity classification by comparing the absolute magnitude of the source in the v - band with a distance modulus for the smc of 18.9 @xcite , to determine whether the absolute magnitude of the source is consistent with the estimated luminosity class for this spectral type ( using absolute magnitudes for oebe stars from @xcite ) .",
    "a v - band magnitude of 14.9 ( table [ ta : irsf ] ) confirms a luminosity class of iv - v for a spectral type of o9.5-b0 , as a star of higher luminosity class would need to be of a later spectral type .",
    "our spectral classification agrees with recent work done by @xcite on the saao 1.9 m telescope , although those authors give a luminosity class of iii which may be too early based on the available line ratios in the spectrum .",
    "strong triple peaked structure is visible in the x - ray pulse profile when the 3rd harmonic was strongest ( top panel fig . [",
    "fig : folded_lc ] ) .",
    "this triple structure remained constant for several observations whilst the outburst was at its most intense . only once the flux had significantly dropped",
    "did the pulse shape begin to evolve into a more familiar single peaked structure ( bottom panel fig .",
    "[ fig : folded_lc ] ) . at this point",
    "the 3rd harmonic fades and the fundamental begins to dominate the pulsed emission . the energy dependent pulse profiles plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : rxte : pulseprofile ] and [ fig : xmm : pulseprofile ] demonstrate a possible change in the x - ray emission at higher energies .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _",
    "profile seems to show the shape of the folded light curves are very similar within the 0.210 kev energy range ( although we are aware that some information is being lost here due to the none - detection of the 3rd harmonic ) .",
    "this was also the case for the _ rxte _ observations in which the 310 kev light curve was split into smaller energy bands ( these have not been presented here ) .",
    "however , moving to higher energies in the _ rxte _ profiles we see a change occuring around 10 kev .",
    "below this energy , the pulse profile suggests a combination of a pencil beam from one pole and a fan beam from the other pole , with an orientation that places two sides of the fan beam and the pencil beam approximately one third of a phase apart .",
    "the smaller of the three peaks is likely the pencil beam in this picture , being a phase of 0.5 apart from the centre of the fan beam double peak .",
    "the hard energy profile shows evidence for a number of possibilities ; the pencil beam has increased in strength , becoming comparible to the fan beam .",
    "the pencil beam may be narrower , although it remains 0.5 phase away from the centre of the other 2 peaks .",
    "the fan beam may have a narrower opening angle at higher energies given the apparant infilling of the gap between the two peaks . at the moment , these are all speculations based on observation and thus more detailed modelling is required to take this discussion further .",
    "the orbital parameters in table [ tab : orbit ] are typical of those seen in other bexrb systems @xcite .",
    "most be systems have p@xmath15 10 - 100d and orbital eccentricities of between 0.3 - 0.5 @xcite .",
    "these parameters also place sxp11.5 firmly in the bexrb regime of the corbet diagram @xcite , lending support to the optical determination that this source is a bexrb and not a supergiant system .",
    "@xcite show that there is a relationship for binary pulsars such that -@xmath1 @xmath16 @xmath17 for a given ns mass and magnetic moment , where @xmath1 is the spin - up in sec / yr , @xmath18 is the spin period in seconds and @xmath19 is the x - ray luminosity in units of @xmath7 ergs / s .",
    "this relationship has since been verified by @xcite using a much larger database of smc binary pulsars .",
    "the spin period and @xmath1 from our fit were used along with the highest _ rxte _ luminosity to place this new system onto the plot of smc pulsars presented in @xcite .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lamb ] .",
    "the position of this source on the plot seems to follow the general distribution of smc pulsars and thus agrees with the theoretical laws of binary accretion .",
    "vs @xmath17 plane adapted from @xcite , where @xmath1 is the spin - up in sec / yr , @xmath18 is the spin period in seconds and @xmath19 is the x - ray luminosity in units of @xmath7 ergs / s .",
    "sxp11.5 is shown to sit in the low period end of the distribution , confirming that the luminosity , pulse period and spin - up calculated in this analysis agree with the equations orginally presented in @xcite and that this source is , in this sense , normal with respect to the general distribution of smc pulsars.[fig : lamb],width=321 ]      due to the lower temperatures believed to be present in the circumstellar environment , the photmetric i - band data presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ogle ] are a direct measure of the circumstellar emission .",
    "these data show that this system has a highly variable circumstellar disk and that the x - ray outburst was triggered by the disk being in an exceptionally large state , relative to its base level .",
    "the vertical dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ogle ] show the start and end points of the x - ray outburst in relation to the optical activity . a single observation at saao in january 2010 ( mjd 55200 ) shows that the disk has started to decrease in size ,",
    "although the x - ray outburst had finished before the disk had returned to the level at which the x - ray emission began .",
    "this could be evidence of a lag between the x - ray and optical emission in this system .",
    "another puzzle that these data introduce is why we only see the orbital modulation in the light curve at the very lowest flux level .",
    "this would suggest that the variability is coming from the stellar atmosphere as the disk would seem to be at a minimum .",
    "in contrast @xcite only detect the orbital modulation from sxp18.3 at the very brightest part of the detrended optical light curve , suggesting that in this system , the variability is coming from the circumstellar disk and not the stellar atmosphere .",
    "it is currently believed that the amount of red and ir emission from the circumstellar disk is directly related to the strength of emission lines in this regime .",
    "[ fig : halpha ] shows two spectra of the h@xmath8 region taken during and many months after the x - ray outburst .",
    "the top panel is a vlt / x - shooter vis arm spectrum showing clearly h@xmath8 being in emission .",
    "this corresponds to the peak of the i - band light curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ogle ] .",
    "equivalent width measurements of the line profile give a value of -8.0@xmath00.5a .",
    "the bottom panel is a spectrum taken on the saao , 1.9 m telescope 4 months after the outburst had ended .",
    "this observation was near - simultaneous to the saao i - band measurement plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ogle ] .",
    "the poor snr in this spectrum made it difficult to make a precise equivalent width measurement , the best estimate being -3 @xmath0 2 , so we can not say by how much the disk has reduced in size .",
    "however , we can conclude that both the h@xmath8 and i - band measurements suggest the disk is shrinking .",
    "comparision to h@xmath8 measurements of other bexrbs shows that , even during a long type - ii x - ray outburst , the disk in this system was comparably quite small ( we have equivalent width measurements of more than -55a in some other systems ; @xcite ) , although it seems not abnormally small based on the relationship presented in @xcite ; those authors present the h@xmath8 equivalent width of a sample of bexrbs against their orbital period and show a linear trend .",
    "although sxp11.5 lies below the best fit line of this trend , it is not a complete outlier and may just lie within the distribution .",
    "unfortunately a more quantitive handle on the ir excess seen in the photometry is needed to help verify the true size of the disk relative to other systems in the smc .",
    "so given only a small circumstellar disk to accrete from , how does accretion continue for over two months in this system ?",
    "the most plausible explanation seems to be that an accretion disk has formed around the ns , allowing accretion to continue after the ns has moved away from the circumstellar disk which may not , in this case , be filling , or be near to filling the orbit of the ns .",
    "however , it is not easy to detect the presence of an accretion disk in hmxbs and so an unusual orbit or other such geometries can not be ruled out as an explanation of what is seen , although this seems unlikely based on the fairly standard parameters obtained in the orbital fit of the x - ray data .",
    "it is also worth noting that the narrow , single peaked h@xmath8 and h@xmath20 emission lines seen in the spectra presented here suggest the disk has a low inclination angle to the observer @xcite .",
    "comparing this to the value of a@xmath21sin__i _ _ presented in table [ tab : orbit ] suggests that the semimajor axis of the disk could be over 300 light - s ( for _ i _",
    "@xmath22 30@xmath23 ) , approximately 18 r@xmath24 assuming a b0 star of radius equal to 7 r@xmath25 .     at the vlt ( top ) and",
    "saao,1.9 m ( bottom ) .",
    "the vlt spectrum was taken on 2009 - 08 - 12 ( mjd 55055 ) , just before sxp11.5 fell below the detection threshold of _ rxte _ , therefore showing the disk during an x - ray active phase .",
    "the saao spectrum was taken on 2009 - 12 - 12 ( mjd 55177 ) , four months after the x - ray outburst ended.[fig : halpha],width=253 ]    in order to explore the extent of the emission from the circumstellar disk , the contemporaneous optical & ir photometric data from mjd 55196 - 55200 shown in table [ ta : irsf ] were used to compare with the predicted stellar emission .",
    "the photometric data were first dereddened by the established value to the smc of e(b - v)=0.08 @xcite .",
    "these were then compared to a kurucz model atmosphere @xcite for a b0v star ( @xmath26=30,000k and log g=4.0 ) . to make the comparison ,",
    "the model atmosphere was normalised to the lowest i - band point in the ogle iii data ( taken around mjd 54000 ) on the assumption that this represents the occasion on which any contribution from the circumstellar disk is at its lowest .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : excess ] from which it is immediately apparent that at the time of the optical & ir photometry there was a clear disk contribution across the whole of the optical & ir regime .",
    "even the b & v points clearly contain some element of such a component . in trying to quantify this excess",
    ", we normalised the kuruscz model to the distance estimate of the smc ( 60 kpc ) and found that it lay very close to the i - band normalised model .",
    "working from this we converted the i - band flux at this base level into a distance estimate , assuming that all the flux is coming from the star .",
    "we find a distance to sxp11.5 of 71@xmath05 kpc .",
    "the error comes from calculating the maximum and minimum distance based on a range of e(b - v ) values .",
    "of course , this value is very dependant on obscuration localised to the smc itself and should be treated with some caution .",
    "what this calculation shows is that it is very likely that the i - band measurement used in the normalisation represents very closely the base level of the disk emission in this system .",
    "a h@xmath8 spectrum is needed to confirm this prediction should the i - band magnitude ever return to this level .",
    ", width=340 ]",
    "we have presented the complete orbital solution to a newly discovered high - mass binary system in the smc , making it one of the few well described systems known outside the galaxy .",
    "these parameters are similar to other binary systems in the galaxy and magellanic clouds and place sxp11.5 firmly in the bexrb region of the corbet diagram . under huge accretion torques , it is shown that the ns is being spun up and that this satisfies current theoretical predictions of the relationship between spin - up , spin period and luminosity in binary systems .",
    "however , it is clear that there is still much to learn about the accretion process itself as shown by the complex triple peaked structure and evolution of the pulse profiles , which are still poorly understood .",
    "spectral analysis of the companion has allowed a classification of o9.5-b0 iv - v to be made .",
    "timing analysis of the optical light curve confirms the orbital period detected in the x - ray .",
    "contemporaneous h@xmath8 spectra show , along with the optical light curve , that the circumstellar disk is shrinking in the time since the x - ray outburst .",
    "although there is evidence that the disk is unusually small compared to other bexrbs , making the extended period of accretion seen in this outburst difficult to explain . we show that the lowest flux seen in the optical light curve is likely to be from a period in which the be star has entirely lost its disk and make a distance estimate to the source based on this assumption .",
    "spectroscopy will be necessary to confirm this prediction should the i - band flux ever return to this level .",
    "sxp11.5 has proven to be a very interesting addition to the smc binary population ; on one hand , it seems to be a very normal system showing orbital parameters and a spectral type that match very well with previously studied systems .",
    "however , it also shows peculiarities , such as showing a small @xmath27 equivalent width relative to other systems with similar orbital periods .",
    "should this system go into another x - ray outburst in the future , further simultaneous optical and x - ray measurements are essential to uncovering where this system lies in the overall population of smc bexrb systems .",
