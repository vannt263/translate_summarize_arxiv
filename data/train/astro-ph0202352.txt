    "the nature of the energy source in ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , sources with l@xmath1l@xmath2 , is still a debated issue .",
    "although it is widely accepted that both starburst and/or agn activity may be responsible for the observed luminosity , their relative contribution is still unconstrained . in some cases ,",
    "even the presence of an agn is unclear .",
    "hard x - ray ( e@xmath32 kev ) studies offer a fundamental tool to investigate the presence of hidden agns inside ulirgs and to obtain quantitative estimates of their contribution to the bolometric luminosity .",
    "indeed some of the ulirgs , classified as pure starburst based on infrared and optical spectroscopy ( i.e. ngc6240 , @xcite ) , show spectral properties typical of obscured agns , when observed in the hard x - rays .",
    "previous x - ray studies of ulirgs with rosat , asca and bepposax have shown that ulirgs are often faint x - ray sources ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "combined with their high luminosity in the infrared bands , this could suggest the presence of an obscured agn .",
    "since ulirgs are the major contributors to the infrared cosmological background , clarifying the issue of how much of their energy output comes from obscured agns would have important implications on both models for the origin of the ir background , and the ir to x - ray background connection .    to shed light on these problems we are carrying out a mini - survey with xmm - newton of 10 ulirgs for which high quality mid - ir and optical spectroscopic data are available .",
    "we present here preliminary results on 5 sources , two of which were not detected before in x - rays .",
    "the 5 ulirgs discussed here have been selected from the sample of genzel el al .",
    "( 1998 ) which is complete to 5.4 jy at 60 @xmath4 m and includes sources with @xmath5 l@xmath6 in the 12100 @xmath4 m band .",
    "the fir selection makes the sample unbiased with respect to absorption , and questions like the relative importance of starburst versus agn activity can be discussed on a sound physical and statistical ground .",
    "in addition , high quality infrared and optical spectroscopic data are also available for all the sources in the sample ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the infrared luminosity and redshift of these 10 objects , as well as the xmm - newton exposure time of the 5 objects discussed here , are reported in table  [ vbraito - c2_tab : tab1 ] .",
    "optical and infrared classifications of the 5 ulirgs presented here are summarized in table  [ vbraito - c2_tab : tab2 ] .",
    "all ten objects are being observed with xmm - newton with @xmath720 ksec exposure each .",
    "the main goal of these observations was to detect the hard x - ray continuum and to investigate the presence of features indicative of agn activity such as fe - k lines .",
    "the original genzel sample is composed of 15 ulirgs : 4 of the remaining 5 objects are being observed anyway with xmm - newton by different pi s ( data will become public after 1-year proprietary period ) .",
    "for the last object ( iras 23060 + 0505 ) adequate asca data are already public",
    ". our aim will also be to combine our x - ray with other available data ( xmm - newton , _ chandra _ , asca ) , as well as with information at other wavelengths .",
    "the xmm - newton observations presented here have been performed between march 2001 and december 2001 with the epic cameras operating in full - frame mode .",
    "data have been processed using the science analysis software ( sas version 5.2 ) ; the latest known calibration files and response matrices released by the epic team have been used .",
    "event files released from the sas standard pipeline have been filtered from high - background time intervals and only events corresponding to pattern 0 - 12 for mos and pattern 0 for pn have been used in the scientific analysis .",
    "the screening process from high background time intervals yielded net exposures between 16.3 ksec and 21.8 ksec ( net exposures for pn camera are reported in table  [ vbraito - c2_tab : tab1 ] ) .",
    "all the 5 ulirgs have been detected in the mos1 , mos2 and pn detectors with signal to noise ratios greater than 3 . except for mkn 231 , which appears to be slightly extended ,",
    "source spectra were extracted from circular regions of @xmath8 arcsec radius .",
    "background spectra have been extracted from source - free circular regions of @xmath9 arcmin radius close to the target .",
    "mkn 231 appears clearly extended ( @xmath7 40 arcsec ) in the xmm - newton images in particular in the soft x - ray band ( e@xmath10 2 kev ) . in order",
    "to be less affected by the galaxy host emission we have chosen to extract the spectra from what appears to be the hard x - ray core of mkn 231 ( radius 15 arcsec ) . in order to improve the statistic , mos1 and",
    "mos2 data have been combined .",
    "both mos and pn spectra were then rebinned to have a s / n @xmath11 in each energy channel .",
    "the combined mos data have been fitted simultaneously with pn data , keeping free the relative normalizations .",

    "a single unabsorbed power law model is not a good description of the xmm - newton data because of large discrepancies in the low energy domain .",
