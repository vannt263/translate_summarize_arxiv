    "the involution @xmath445 can be extended to a map @xmath446 by setting @xmath447 .",
    "we define @xmath129 in the following way : for every @xmath448 we set @xmath449 this is a well defined element in @xmath192 because @xmath450 , i.e. the numerator vanishes mod @xmath443 .",

    "recall from [ filtration1 ] that the filtration on @xmath192 is the one induced ( under @xmath222 ) from the isomorphism @xmath148 given in theorem [ ren ] .",

    "now , by looking at the definition of the map @xmath148 ( see @xcite 5.5 . ) , we see that the the map @xmath465 is indeed given by ( [ altra ] ) .",

    "proof of @xmath470 to prove that @xmath471 factors through @xmath472 we use lemma [ zerobracket ] . recall that we defined @xmath129 from @xmath457 to @xmath192 to be @xmath449 because of the above lemma , it is clear that , when we consider the inclusion @xmath473 and the composition with the map to @xmath474 , the resulting map factors as : @xmath475\\ar[d ] & j_*j^*({\\mathfrak{z}_{crit}}\\boxtimes { \\mathfrak{z}_{crit}}^c)\\ar[r]&\\delta_!({\\mathcal{b}^0})\\\\ { \\mathfrak{z}_{crit}}\\boxtimes { \\mathfrak{z}_{crit}}\\ar[r]^{\\frac{1}{2}\\{\\,,\\,\\ } } & \\delta_!({\\mathfrak{z}_{crit}})\\ar[ru]_{\\delta_!(l)}&},\\ ] ] which implies that the map factors through a map @xmath476 .",
    "first of all , recall that to pass from @xmath420 to @xmath430 we took the quotient by the image of the difference of two maps from @xmath483 to @xmath420 .",
    "the first map was given by @xmath484 while the second map was induced by the composition @xmath485 which vanishes on @xmath486 .",
    "when we compose the map ( [ m1 ] ) with @xmath467 , we get @xmath487 .",
    "however when we compose the second map with @xmath488 because of remark [ rem9 ] , we see that this map corresponds to @xmath489 hence the difference of the images goes to zero under @xmath467 .",
    "proof of @xmath490 now we are left with checking that @xmath467 factors through @xmath491 this will occupy the rest of the article . recall that @xmath492 was given as a quotient of @xmath430 by the map @xmath388 .",
    "the leibniz relation was given as the image of a map @xmath493 and this map was the sum of three maps , @xmath494 @xmath362 and @xmath363 , from @xmath495 which vanished on @xmath496 .",
    "hence we want to check that the composition @xmath497 vanishes . instead of considering the map from @xmath498 we can consider the three maps @xmath499^{\\alpha_1}\\ar@<-2ex>[r]^{\\alpha_3}\\ar[r]^{\\alpha_2 } & \\delta_{!}({\\text{ind}_{{\\mathfrak{z}_{crit}}}^{ch}({\\mathfrak{z}_{crit}}^c)})\\ar[r]^-{\\overline{f}}&\\delta_!({\\mathcal{b}^0}),}\\ ] ] and show that the composition @xmath500 is zero .",
    "recall that the first map , @xmath360 , was given by projecting onto @xmath501 , i.e. @xmath502^{\\alpha_1}\\ar[r ] & j_*j^*({\\mathfrak{z}_{crit}}\\boxtimes { \\mathfrak{z}_{crit}}^c)\\ar[r]_{\\beta}&\\delta_!({\\text{ind}_{{\\mathfrak{z}_{crit}}}^{ch}({\\mathfrak{z}_{crit}}^c)})},\\ ] ] where @xmath503 denotes the second component of the projection @xmath504 the second map , @xmath362 , was given by @xmath505 , and the third map @xmath363 was given by the composition @xmath506      now consider the chiral algebra @xmath508 and denote by @xmath509 its chiral operation . consider the map @xmath510 @xmath511 ( i.e. we are not taking this element @xmath512 ) .",
    "it is clear that the three maps @xmath513 , @xmath514 and @xmath515 given by @xmath516 @xmath517        respectively , vanish on @xmath521 , in particular they define well defined maps from @xmath495 to @xmath474 .",
    "moreover the resulting maps coincide with @xmath360 , @xmath362 and @xmath363 composed with @xmath431 .",
    "in fact , the first and the last coincide by definition .",
    "for the second one , simply note that , modulo @xmath443 , the map @xmath522 equals @xmath167 . + by the above , to show that the combination of the three maps given in ( [ fine ? ] ) is zero , it is enough to check that the combination @xmath523 of the above three maps vanishes .",
    "+ let us denote by @xmath524 , @xmath525 and @xmath526 the maps from @xmath527 to @xmath528 corresponding to @xmath529 @xmath514 and @xmath515 respectively ( i.e. before taking the maps @xmath512 ) .",
    "we will show that the combination @xmath530 is already zero .",
    "+ because @xmath508 is @xmath531-torsion free , it is enough to show that the three maps agree after multiplication by @xmath531 . but now note that each of the maps @xmath532 is the sum of two terms , and the sum of the resulting six maps is zero .",
    "indeed @xmath533 equals the sum of the following two maps : @xmath534 @xmath535 on the other hand , the map @xmath536 is given by the sum of the following @xmath537 @xmath538 it is clear that the map ( [ term1 ] ) equals minus the map ( [ term11 ] ) .",
    "similarly , the relation @xmath539 guarantees that the two maps summing up to @xmath540 , given by @xmath541 and @xmath542 cancel with the remaining maps ( [ term2 ] ) and ( [ term22 ] ) respectively . +",
    "hence the composition @xmath367 as a map from @xmath495 to @xmath543 is zero , i.e. the map @xmath482 factors as @xmath544\\ar[r]^{\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\overline{f}}&\\delta_!({\\mathcal{b}^0})\\\\ \\delta_!(\\omega({\\mathfrak{z}_{crit}})^c)\\ar[ur]_{f}&}.\\ ] ] by kashiwara we obtain the desired map @xmath545 , and this concludes the proof of theorem [ main2 ] .",
