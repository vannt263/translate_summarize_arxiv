    "the presence of density waves ( dws ) in high temperature superconducting cuprates is now well - established  @xcite , and growing evidence suggest that dws and the pseudogap ( pg ) are related  @xcite but distinct phenomena  @xcite . however , it is not yet clear how this distinction between dws and the pg appears in the tunneling density of state ( dos ) of cuprates  @xcite .",
    "scanning tunneling microscopy played a key role in the discovery of dws in cuprates .",
    "the early finding of a checkerboard dw in vortex cores  @xcite , where @xmath0-wave superconductivity ( @xmath0sc ) is weakened by a magnetic field , suggested a competition between @xmath0sc and dws .",
    "however , finding dws was the culmination of much work previously focusing on the presence of low - energy _ sub - gap structures _ in the local dos surrounding vortex cores  @xcite .",
    "sub - gap structures were typically found between @xmath25  mev and @xmath210  mev in the conductance spectra of optimally doped ybba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( ybco )  @xcite and bi@xmath6sr@xmath6cacu@xmath6o@xmath7 ( bscco )  @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of sub - gap structures ( sgs ) exactly where charge order was found indicates a likely relation between these phenomena  @xcite .",
    "moreover , sub - gap structures are also found at zero - field , so vortices and magnetic fields are not the key to explain them .",
    "recently reported those structures in the averaged zero - field spectra of ybco , and suggested : `` _ _ it is tempting to link the sgs with the static charge density wave discovered recently in y123 _ _ ''  @xcite .",
    "equivalent zero - field structures had been extensively studied in underdoped samples of bscco  @xcite and mainly occur in locally resolved spectra where density waves are enhanced .",
    "[ bruer_measure ] reproduces typical examples of sub - gap structures at zero - field in bscco and ybco .",
    "along with proposed scenarios of spin density waves  @xcite and staggered flux  @xcite , early theoretical work firmly stated the likeliness of pair density waves ( pdws )   to explain the checkerboard patterns found in stm .",
    "recent work by agterberg and garaud further showed that for competing @xmath0sc and pdw , a vortex core will favor pdw through the suppression of @xmath0sc , and also drive complementary charge modulation , as those seen in experiments  @xcite .",
    "after the observation by lee that some photoemission results in cuprates agree better with a pdw scenario than with one based on charge density waves  @xcite , and after much work stating how many theoretical models are prone to several forms of pdws  @xcite , experimental evidence of pair density wave was finally obtained , at zero - field , for an underdoped sample of bscco , through scanning josephson tunneling spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "it would be hard , at this point , to exclude pdws from the cuprate puzzle .    in this work , we consider phenomenological mean - field hamiltonians for coexisting bidirectional bond - centered density wave and bidirectional pair density waves ( similar to those experimentally reported in ref .  )",
    "combined to d - wave superconductivity , and we find qualitative agreement with observed spectra for sub - gap structures in the  dos .",
    "our main conclusions are that ( i ) pair density waves are a key ingredient to obtain low - energy sub - gap structures in the @xmath0sc gap , and ( ii ) no pseudogap appears in the dos for systems with charge or pair density waves alone and without nesting , clarifying the need for a distinct phenomenon to explain the tunneling pg .",
    "these conclusions hold for a range of established band structures for cuprates , and realistic magnitudes for the @xmath0sc and dws mean fields .",
    "a secondary conclusion of our work is that the band structure plays a role at least as critical as the periodicity of the dw in the reconstruction caused by dw , and in the corresponding  dos .",
    "the calculated dos exhibit extraordinary complexity and variability that reflect the great variability observed in conductance spectra in stm  @xcite , probably explaining why sub - gap structures are not always seen .",
    "this effect does not seem to be discussed in previous studies  @xcite , and needs to be considered carefully when attempting to find universal properties among different compounds with band reconstruction .",
    "even assuming that sharp quasiparticles reappear in ordered states  @xcite , allowing for a single - particle approach , modeling density waves in cuprates is a difficult theoretical problem for two reasons : ( i ) they are incommensurate , and ( ii ) they are short - ranged , meaning that the system is disordered .",
    "numerous recent work address these issues ( see  ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "by contrast , the computations presented here are for simple , long - ranged commensurate order . in the past",
    ", similar simplifications were used to successfully obtain dw - induced quantum oscillation frequencies in ybco  @xcite , and also to address the closely related question of how spin density waves can reconcile the photoemission and tunneling observations in cuprates  @xcite .",
    "the interest of such simplifications comes from the wide range of parameters that can be tested .",
    "our results , along with those of ref .  and  , suggest that the realistic disordered incommensurate systems may be approximated locally by ordered commensurate ones",
    ". the complex variation of the local dos with position in experiments  @xcite would be reflected , in our model , by the complex variation of the dos with band structure , dws wave vector , and the strengths of dws mean fields .",
    "it is therefore an approach in the spirit of the virtual crystal approximation  @xcite , which is computationally much cheaper than solving a large disordered system .",
    "notably , in ref .  , it was shown , along with results comparable to ours , but for spin dw , that adding disorder to long - ranged commensurate dw systems simply spreads otherwise sharp features found in the spectra , without changing the qualitative conclusions .",
    "this approach finds additional justification from work showing how strong correlations generically protect @xmath0wave superconductivity against disorder  @xcite .",

    "[ figure_variability ] , dotted green curves ) . in that case , not only @xmath1pdw scattering processes of order @xmath38 open a small gap , but also hybrid processes implying both @xmath1pdw and @xmath0ff - dw . however , for these gaps to reach sizes comparable to the experimental pg , the mean fields @xmath45 and @xmath46 must reach unlikely strengths , similar to those discussed above for the @xmath0ff - dw only case .    a second observation for fig .  [ figure_variability ]",
    "is that , although low - energy dos curves in the absence of @xmath0sc are not much changed by dws , the dos in the presence of @xmath0sc are modified appreciably by the presence of @xmath0ff - dw and @xmath1pdw . in some cases , the @xmath0sc gap exhibits major deformations even in the presence of weak density waves .",
    "this is true for @xmath0sc coexisting with @xmath0ff - dw ( thin red curves ) , for @xmath0sc coexisting with @xmath1pdw ( thicker blue curves ) , or for @xmath0sc coexisting with both ( thickest green curves ) .",
    "changes are diverse when compared to the bare @xmath0sc case ( black curves ) , notable ones being : strongly reduced coherence peaks ( fig .  [ figure_variability](b ) ,  ( c ) ,  ( f ) ,  and  ( i ) , thickest green curves ) and displacement of coherence peaks , effectively changing the size of the gap ( fig .",
    "[ figure_variability](b ) ,  ( f ) ,  and  ( i ) , thin red curves ) .",

    "this is highly reminiscent of the diversity of local conductance spectra observed in tunneling experiments  @xcite ( especially in supplementary material of ref .  ) .",
    "our last and most important observation for fig .",
    "[ figure_variability ] is that sub - gap structures , similar to those observed in the surrounding of vortex cores , appear mainly when @xmath0sc is accompanied by bidirectional @xmath1 pair density wave @xmath1pdw ( fig .",
    "[ figure_variability](a ) ,  ( b ) ,  ( c ) ,  ( d ) ,  ( f ) ,  and  ( i ) , thick blue curves ) without @xmath0ff - dw . when the three orders are present , sub - gap structures can also be obtained ( fig .",
    "[ figure_variability](c ) , thickest green curve ) although they are more apparent with @xmath1pdw stronger than @xmath0ff - dw ( not shown ) .",
    "additionally , when @xmath0ff - dw and @xmath1pdw coexist without uniform @xmath0-wave superconductivity ( fig .  [ figure_variability ] , dotted green curves ) , the small gap we obtain is reminiscent of what is measured directly inside the vortex core , where sc is mostly suppressed in the experiments  @xcite .    to help understand the results , fig .",
    "[ figure_mdc_variability ] shows the fermi surfaces ( fs , @xmath86 ) , without superconductivity , for all nine combinations of wave vectors and band structures , only for @xmath0ff - dw with @xmath79 ( left in red ) and for @xmath1pdw with @xmath80 ( right in blue ) .",
    "no portion of the fs is completely gapped by the dws , and instead many hole and electron pockets appear , separated by the new bragg planes imposed by the dws . the shape and size of those pockets",
    "are extremely sensitive to the band structure and wave vector used . note that the fs shown are for dws without @xmath0sc , and that the corresponding dos ( red and blue dotted curves of fig .",
    "[ figure_variability ] ) were left almost unchanged around the fermi energy .",
    "no gap appears in our low energy dos without @xmath0sc because , in general , a dw alone does not open - up a gap at the fermi surface .",
    "contrary to the superconducting gap , a dw gap is not locked to the fermi energy . in one dimension , for example ,",
    "a dw of period @xmath38 simply splits the brillouin zone in @xmath38 , therefore separating the original band in @xmath38 new bands each containing @xmath87 of all the states .",
    "the @xmath88 gaps would thus appear at fixed fillings in the band , regardless of the energy . in two dimensions , for small dw magnitudes , the new bands do not have to split completely ; they can overlap in @xmath19 space without touching in @xmath51-space , and this yields a more complicated picture . still , in the limit of very large dw magnitudes",
    "@xmath45 , the original band has to split completely into new bands containing a fixed fraction of the total number of states .",
    "this fraction is determined by the wave vectors of the dw at play .",
    "for example , the bidirectional @xmath0ff - dw of fig .  [ figure_full_dos](a ) , composed of two perpendicular density waves with @xmath89 should split the band in 9 ( because the exact treatment requires a @xmath62 matrix with @xmath90 , providing 9 eigenvalues ) .",
    "each of those bands occupies a @xmath51-space volume of the reduced brillouin zone , and therefore contains @xmath91 of the states .",
    "consequently , the main gaps should only appear at fillings that are multiples of @xmath91 .",
    "the details of the splitting depend strongly on the symmetries of the system , on the original band structure , and on the dw s form factor .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "[ figure_full_dos](a ) , for wave vector @xmath69 the main gaps are exactly at fillings @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the picture is similar for fig .",
    "[ figure_full_dos](b ) , showing wave vector @xmath70 , which indicates that incommensurability plays a minor role .",
    "the hole doping used in this work is @xmath94 relative to half - filling ( 1/2 ) , and corresponds to an absolute filling of 7/16 and therefore , in our results , for wave vectors close to experimental ones , the fermi level never lies in a dw gap , as seen in fig .",
    "[ figure_full_dos ] .",
    "this observation  the fact that a dw gap is constrained to appear at a wave - vector determined filling instead of a given energy ",
    "rules out most scenarios explaining the pseudogap with dw .",
    "the only density waves which would open a gap at the fermi surface are those with wave vectors connecting flat segments of the fermi surfaces , and they are inconsistent with combined photoemission , x - ray results  @xcite and detailed analysis of scanning tunneling spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "our conclusion therefore reinforces the idea that the pg is a different phenomenon . the present analysis , however , does not hold for more complex coupling in @xmath51-space , for example lee s amperean pairing and so - called @xmath95 scenarios  @xcite .",
    "let s now turn to the densities of states in the presence of @xmath0sc .",
    "a @xmath0-wave gap is anisotropic ; the gapping energy changes with the direction of  @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the dos value at a given energy  the number of states at a given energy within the gap  is tied to the number of states contained along a specific direction in @xmath51-space ( the spectral weight ) . with a smooth fs , the spectral weight changes monotonically as a function of direction in @xmath51-space , and",
    "therefore the gap is smooth as a function of energy : it is the well - known v - shaped gap of standard @xmath0-wave superconductors . on the other hand , for a @xmath0-wave gap built on a complex reconstructed fs ,",
    "the spectral weight is very irregular as a function of direction , and this is why we obtain an irregular gap as a function of energy . in the end ,",
    "only the anisotropy of the gap and the complexity of the bands onto which it opens are necessary to account for the complicated dos we find .",
    "this last statement encompasses much beyond the systems explored here , and will require further investigation .    in our computations , the final form of substructures",
    "are most sensitive to the factors determining the underlying complicated fs ; here those were : ( i ) the nature of the reconstruction ( whether it was @xmath1pdw or @xmath0ff - dw ) , ( ii ) the wave vector of the dws , and ( iii ) the initial band structure .",
    "varying the value of the superconducting mean - field @xmath29 did not have as much influence ( not shown here ) .    among all dos deformations obtained ,",
    "sub - gap structures like those of tunneling experiments agree better with our dos reconstructed by pdw .",
    "this suggests that the pdw measured in bscco  @xcite may be responsible for the substructures observed in cuprates .",
    "moreover , as worked out by agterberg and garaud  @xcite , a vortex core can favor pdw through the suppression of @xmath0sc , so our result is consistent with the experimental fact that substructures are enhanced around vortex cores .",
    "note , however , that the form of pdw used by agterberg and garaud s work is not the same as ours .",
    "an alternative and intuitive explanation for the enhancement of pdw near vortices might be that the non - zero momentum @xmath96 carried by pdws accommodates better the high currents expected near vortex cores .",
    "however , in our model , there is no vortex , and every @xmath1pdw included are combinations of @xmath97 and @xmath98 causing no actual currents .",
    "the careful observer might notice some anisotropy on our @xmath0ff - dw fermi - surfaces in fig .",
    "[ figure_mdc_variability ] .",
    "this is expected , since it is known that the combination of a @xmath0ff - dw atop a symmetrical band results in @xmath99 breaking c@xmath100 symmetry ( see supplementary material of ref .  ) . for the same reason , the combination of a @xmath1pdw atop the @xmath0sc results in a pairing @xmath101 that also breaks c@xmath100 symmetry .",
    "this anisotropy causes even more complexity in the dos , because each quadrant of @xmath51-space then hosts reconstructed pockets opening and closing at slightly different energies @xmath19 .",
    "finally , note that a perfect fit to experiments was not the aim here , since we focused on general conditions enabling sub - gap structures .",
    "as discussed , the results are extremely sensitive to the band structure used , and knowing that bscco and ybco are in fact bi - layer compounds , and that modeling the bi - layer splitting is known to improve the fit to conductance spectra substantially  @xcite , we would suggest that bi - layer splitting be included to achieve better fits .",
    "similarily , taking into account the spatial dependence of the wannier functions seems to be very important for a quantitative fit  @xcite .",
    "in summary , one of the gap deformations obtained , mainly caused by pair density waves , is the appearance of sub - gap structures , reminiscent of those seen near vortex cores , and sometimes reported at zero - field in cuprates .",
    "arguably , in the vicinity of a vortex core ( where checkerboard dws were first discovered ) , in high field , near impurities , or simply in extreme cases of inhomogeneity , the pair density wave is enhanced , and those sub - gap structures appear more clearly .",
    "our results thus suggest that the pdw measured in bscco  @xcite may be responsible for the substructures observed in cuprates .",
    "we also demonstrated , in the mean - field limit , for reasonable one - band approximations to cuprates , that neither bidirectional @xmath0ff - dw nor @xmath1pdw alone could be responsible for the opening of the pseudogap in the dos in the absence of nesting .",
    "therefore , this work reinforces the idea that the pseudogap is a distinct phenomenon .    instead , dws cause various kinds of deformations of the @xmath0sc gap , comparable to the variability of local tunneling spectra .",
    "those deformations of the dos depend as strongly on the band - structures involved than they do on the wave vector of the  dw .    to conclude ,",
    "let us mention how practical constraints on theories emerge from the idea that sub - gap structures are the consequence of dws .",
    "the behavior of experimental sub - gap structures with position is very specific  @xcite , for example their characteristic energy does not change much when approaching a vortex core .",
    "on the other hand , our calculated sub - gap structures depend strongly on the parameters at play , namely the dw wave vector , magnitudes @xmath29 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and band - structure .",
    "hence , in order to achieve quantitative agreement with experiments , a theory of cuprates would have to predict a delicate balance between those parameters , or their effective equivalent .",
    "such fine tuning would be very surprising coming from a simple mix of competing orders .",
    "this work therefore provides a good justification , beyond simple taste for unified theories , to search for the common origin of intertwined orders in cuprates  @xcite .",
