    "silicon carbide ( sic ) is a well known material used for a variety of applications for a long time and today regarded as a promising material for power electronics to sustain our society due to its attractive properties such as wide band gap and high durability under harsh environment @xcite .",
    "one of its advantages over other wide bandgap semiconductors is that insulating films , which are indispensable for electronic devices , are formed by thermal oxidation of sic , leading to the insulating sio@xmath0 over - layers .",
    "this also ensures the good connectivity with the si technology which would collapse were it not for high - quality ultra - thin sio@xmath0 layers .",
    "however , the mobility of current sic mosfet ( metal - oxide - semiconductor field - effect transistor ) is lower than 10% of the bulk mobility , indicative of the existence of carrier - trapping defects at the interface@xcite .",
    "many experimental and theoretical efforts @xcite in the past tried to identify such defects at the interface , but the microscopic identification has not been achieved yet .    scientifically , oxidation process itself is mysterious : oxygen attacks sic to form sio@xmath0 , inevitably annihilating a massive amount of carbon atoms @xcite .",
    "this makes the oxidation of sic much complicated compared with the si oxidation .",
    "the mechanism of the carbon annihilation is totally unknown , although existence of remaining carbon at the interface as a form of the nano - cluster is speculated in some theoretical works @xcite .",
    "another interesting fact related to the thermal oxidation is that the oxidation rate of the c face [ i.e. , the ( 000@xmath1 ) surface ] is about ten times faster than that of the si face [ the ( 0001 ) surface ] .",
    "this infers that oxidation processes on the si- and c - faces are different .",
    "passivation of the carrier - trapping defects also depends on the surface orientation .",
    "hydrogen treatment reduces the defect density in the case of oxidation of c - face . on the other hand , in the case of si - face , no",
    ", no@xmath0 or pocl@xmath2 annealing is used instead of hydrogen treatment@xcite .",
    "knowledge of the defect passivation depending on the surface orientation is totally lacking .",
    "it is thus highly demanded to clarify the atom - scale mechanism of the sic oxidation which is associated with the c annihilation , depends on the surface orientation and causes the carrier - trapping defects at the interface .    in this study",
    ", we clarify atom - scale processes at the initial stage of the oxidation of the si- and c - faces in 4h - sic , based on the density functional theory ( dft)@xcite .",
    "we carry out both static total - energy electronic - structure calculations and molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations .",
    "we consider how each si and c atomic site is oxidized and explore most probable reaction pathways and corresponding energy barriers .    in section [ method ] ,",
    "we explain pertinent features of our calculations .",
    "sections [ results_c ] and [ results_si ] show our results on the c - face , and the si - face , respectively .",

    "in our density - functional calculations , we have adopted the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) functional@xcite in generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) to the exchange - correlation energy functional .",
    "it is well known that gga underestimates band gaps .",
    "hence , when quantitative discussion on band structures is necessary , we have also used a hybrid functional of hyde - scuseria - ernzerhof ( hse06)@xcite to reproduce the values of band gaps correctly .    for the static electronic structure calculations , we have used the vienna @xmath3 @xmath4 simulation package ( vasp)@xcite .",
    "we have adopted a plane - wave - basis set with energy cutoff of 400 ev to expand the wave function and density .",
    "the projector augmented wave ( paw ) pseudopotentials @xcite have been used in this study . in this study",
    "we have treated the sic substrate by a slab consisting of 6 bilayers with the @xmath5 periodicity in the lateral plane .",
    "a vacuum region of 10-  thickness is enough to avoid fictitious interactions between the adjacent slabs .",
    "the bottom surface of the slab is fixed to the bulk crystallographic and terminated by h atoms to compensate for the missing bonds , whereas the rest of the system is allowed to evolve and relax freely .",
    "brillouin zone ( bz ) integration has been performed with monkhorst - pack 2x2x1 sample @xmath6 points for the slab model .",
    "these parameters are adopted after the examination of the accuracy within 0.03 ev in total energy .",
    "the structural optimization has been done with a tolerance of @xmath7 ev@xmath8 .    in the calculations for molecular dynamics , we have adopted car - parrinello md ( cpmd ) scheme @xcite implemented in real - space dft code ( rsdft ) @xcite . in the rsdft scheme , we introduce real - space grids and all the quantities including kohn - sham orbitals and thus valence electron densities are computed on the grid points .",

    "all simulations are done within the pbe .",
    "bz integration has been performed with @xmath9 point in md simulations .",
    "the ionic temperature is controlled by nose-hoover thermostat @xcite in the constant nvt simulations .",

    "we then consider how each si and c atomic layer is oxidized on thus determined most stable c- and si - faces .",
    "namely , we clarify the oxidation process of the topmost surface 3 layers .",
    "we have found that the essential features of the oxidation process is common on the surface with different stacking sequence . stacking",

    "the reaction of the o@xmath0 dissociation and the subsequent o adsorption on the nearest - neighbor on - top c sites clarified above is expected to occur in a ubiquitous way during the oxidation of the c - faces .",
