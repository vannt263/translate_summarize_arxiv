    "the noncommutative a - ideal was defined in @xcite using kauffman bracket skein modules .",

    "the simplest skein module is the kauffman bracket skein module , defined using the kauffman bracket skein relation @xcite .",
    "the module depends on a parameter @xmath1 , the variable of the kauffman bracket . a theorem of bullock , przytycki and sikora @xcite",
    ", @xcite shows that when @xmath2 , the kauffman bracket skein module of a 3-manifold has a ring structure , which ring is isomorphic with the affine character ring of @xmath3-representations of the fundamental group of the manifold .",
    "this result allows the study of @xmath3-invariants of knots from the point of view of quantum invariants .",
    "an example for which this is done is the a - polynomial .",
    "the a - polynomial of a knot was introduced by cooper , culler , gillet , long , and shalen in @xcite using the character variety of @xmath3-representations of the fundamental group of the knot complement .",
    "the construction was later generalized via kauffman bracket skein modules in @xcite , giving rise to a new knot invariant , the noncommutative a - ideal .",
    "the a - ideal is a finitely generated ideal of polynomials in two noncommuting variables .",
    "it depends on a parameter @xmath1 , and when @xmath2 , the radical of the one dimensional part of the ideal is generated by the a - polynomial of the knot .    in @xcite",
    "was discovered a property relating the noncommutative a - ideal to the jones polynomial . called the orthogonality relation ,",
    "this property states that every nonzero element in the a - ideal yields a matrix annihilating the vector with entries the colored jones polynomials of the knot . as an application of the orthogonality relation ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that if the a - ideal contains a polynomial of second degree in the variable corresponding to the longitude of the knot , whose coefficients satisfy a certain technical property , then the a - ideal of the knot determines all of its colored jones polynomials . in this paper",
    "we prove that this is the case with the @xmath0-torus knots , @xmath4 an integer .",
    "the main result of the paper is    * theorem  1.1 * _ any knot having the same noncommutative a - ideal as the @xmath0-torus knot has the same colored jones polynomials . _    to avoid the hassle of keeping track of both the sign of @xmath4 and of the types of crossings in diagrams , we do the proof for the case where @xmath4 is _ positive_. the case where @xmath4 is negative is obtained by replacing in all formulas @xmath4 by @xmath5 and @xmath1 by @xmath6 .",
    "a _ framed link _ in an orientable manifold @xmath7 is a disjoint union of annuli .",
    "if the manifold is the cylinder over the torus , framed links will be identified with curves , using the convention that the annulus is parallel to the framing . in figures",
    "annuli will be represented by curves , the framing will be considered parallel to the plane of the drawing ( the so called blackboard framing ) .",

    "the quotient of this module by the smallest submodule containing all expressions of the form @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where the links in each expression are identical except in a ball in which they look like depicted , is called the kauffman bracket skein module of @xmath7 , and is denoted by @xmath12 . if @xmath1 is a complex number instead of the variable of a polynomial , then with the same definition the kauffman bracket skein module becomes a complex vector space .",
    "the kauffman bracket skein module of a cylinder over a surface has an algebra structure .",
    "the multiplication is induced by the operation of gluing one cylinder atop another .",
    "similarly , the operation of gluing the cylinder over @xmath13 to @xmath7 induces a @xmath14-left module structure on @xmath12 .",
    "we denote by @xmath15 the multiplication in @xmath14 . for a link @xmath16 in a skein module",
    "we will denote by @xmath17 the link consisting of @xmath18 parallel copies of @xmath19 , and extend the notation to polynomials .",
    "two families of polynomials are of interest to us .",
    "the first family consists of the classical chebyshev polynomials , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "related to them are the polynomials @xmath23 subject to the same recurrence relation but with @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "extend both polynomials recursively to all indices @xmath26 .",

    "is called the @xmath18th colored kauffman bracket of the knot . under the change of variable @xmath32",
    "this becomes the @xmath18th colored jones polynomial .",
