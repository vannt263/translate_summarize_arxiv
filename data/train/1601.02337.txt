    ", the line ratio is expected to be 1.73 for polar cap radius of 1.5 km ( nishimura 2013 ) .",
    "such decrease in energy ratio ( 1.57 - 1.73 ) is possible for viewing angle of 0.52 - 0.79 where superimposition of large numbers of fundamental line emerging from different heights of line - forming region shifts the energy to higher side with nearly constant energy for first harmonic . in another scenario , the anharmonicity in the line ratio",
    "can be expected due to distortion or displacement from the dipole geometry of the magnetic field . in this case , both crsfs are generated at two different poles of neutron star and produce a significant phase shift between both line parameters .",
    "such phase - shift was not seen in cep  x-4 ( fig .  [ spec_para ] ) .",
    "for the first time , we present the detailed analysis of fundamental cyclotron line with previously unknown first cyclotron harmonic in cep  x-4 .",
    "numerous simulation works on cyclotron lines were done by considering certain sets of assumptions and geometry in line forming regions ( araya - gchez & harding 2000 ; schnherr et al .",
    "2007 ; mukherjee & bhattacharya 2012 ) .",
    "these studies predicted that the cyclotron absorption line parameters are expected to show 10 - 20% variation over pulse phases depending on the viewing angle of the accretion column .",
    "however , more than 30% variation in cyclotron parameters can be explained by considering distortion in the magnetic dipole geometry of the pulsar ( schnherr et al .",
