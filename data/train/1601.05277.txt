    "12 - 15 and table 4 ]    to constrain the possible mineralogies of the investigated asteroids , we conducted a search for meteorite and/or mineral spectral matches .",
    "we sought matches only for objects observed across the entire vis  nir wavelength range .",
    "we used the publicly available relab spectrum library ( pieters , 1983 ) . for each spectrum in the library ,",
    "a filter was applied to find relevant wavelengths ( 0.4 to 2.45 @xmath1 m ) .",
    "then , a second filter was applied to reject spectra with irrelevant albedo values ( i.e. brightness at 0.55 @xmath1 m @xmath30 ) .",
    "a chi - squared value was calculated relative to the normalized input asteroid spectrum .",
    "we used the asteroid wavelength sampling to resample the laboratory spectra by linear interpolation .",
    "this allowed a least - squares calculation with the number of points equal to the wavelength sampling of the asteroid spectrum .",
    "the relab data files were sorted according to the corresponding chi - squared values , and finally visually examined .",
    "a complete description of the search methodology can be found in fornasier et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2011 ) .",
    "the best matches between the observed asteroids and meteorites from the relab database are reported in table  [ met ] , and shown in figures  [ f11 ] -  [ f14 ] .",
    "most of the themis and beagle families members are matched by cm2 carbonaceous chondrites , with few objects having cv3 or ci as best match .",
    "we do not see differences in the meteorite class matches between the beagle and themis families members , except that there are no cv3 best match for beagle members . even if the aqueous alteration band at 0.7 @xmath1 m has been identified just on one beagle member ( kaluna et al . , 2016 ) , the meteorite matches indicate that these asteroids may have experienced aqueous alteration in the past .",
    "as previously stated , not all the aqueous altered cm / ci meteorites show this feature ( mcadam et al .",
    "+ the asteroid ( 2519 ) annagerman is spectrally perfectly matched by the unusual ci / cm y-86720,77 with grain size @xmath9 125 @xmath1 m , even if there are some differences in the albedo values , 11% for the asteroid and 6% for the meteorite .",
    "however it must be noted that the meteorite reflectance is usually evaluated at phase angle @xmath13 7 @xmath31 so it does not include the opposition surge effect .",
    "the composition and structure of the cm2 y-86720 indicates that this meteorite was thoroughly aqueous altered ( lipschutz et al .",
    "1999 ) and heated .",
    "interestingly , some of the targets are best matched by heated or unusual meteorites .",
    "this was already noticed by clark et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , who found that themis family asteroids tend to be best fitted by cm , ci , cr , cm / ci unusual meteorites , and/or heated cm / ci samples , and that 50% of these asteroids are consistent with thermally metamorphosed material .",
    "+ our spectral matches are also in agreement with the de lon et al .",
    "( 2012 ) results from the analysis of b - type asteroids , including 8 themis members . these last fall in the g2-g5 groups as defined by de lon et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , and are spectrally best matched by meteorites who experienced different stages of the aqueous alteration , from the less altered cv3 meteorites up to the extensively altered cm2 chondrites .",
    "the spectral analysis together with the meteorite matches indicate that themis members show a large spectral variety and different carbonaceous chondrite matches ( from cv3 to cm2-ci ) , some of them being unusual or heated , indicating that these asteroids were thermally metamorphosed in the past .",
    "spectroscopic studies of asteroid families can provide information about the interior of their parent bodies ( e.g. , cellino et al .",
    "2002 ) ; this can constrain models on the thermal and collisional evolution of asteroids . more specifically , simulations of catastrophic disruption processes suggest that the ejected material coming from coherent sections of a heterogeneous progenitor body should maintain a coherent compositional structure ( michel et al .",
    "therefore , compositional gradients within planetesimals should expose themselves within asteroid families ( e.g. , jacobson et al .",
    "2014 ) . to date , no remnants of a completely disrupted differentiated body have been identified .",
    "vesta is the only family generated from a differentiated body ( e.g. , lazzaro et al .",
    "2004 ; binzel and xu 1993 ) , but it is not a result of a catastrophic disruption , so its members come from the surface of the parent body .",
    "the case of the themis family seems to be unique .",
    "for example , jacobson et al . (",
    "2014 ) used estimates of the progenitor mass and the mass of the largest remnant to assess the exposed nature of asteroid families , and he suggested that the themis family is possibly the most exposed one . we have found clear evidence of spectral diversity within the themis family , and between themis and beagle families members .",
    "there are several possible interpretations of this spectral diversity , which include a compositional gradient with depth in the original parent body ( and/or with fragment size ) , space weathering effects , the survival of projectile fragments with a different composition , or a combination of these ( e.g. , campins et al . 2012 ) , that we discuss in the following .",
    "+      in this scenario , the diversity we see nowdays in themis reflects different source regions in the parent body that was originally heterogeneous showing a compositional gradient .",
    "we clarify that a compositional gradient does not necessarily mean a metal core with a silicate mantle and crust .",
    "in fact , for primitive asteroids like the themis parent body it was more likely a differentiation of rock and ice where the core underwent mild temperatures and no high thermal metamorphism .",
    "( e.g. , castillo - rogez & schmidt 2010 ) .",
    "consistent with this mild temperature model are the visible spectroscopic results of 36 members of the themis family presented by florczak et al .",
    "they found that about 50% of their sample showed evidence of aqueous alteration , indicating that the parent body was sufficiently altered thermally to mobilize water .",
    "the results of florczak et al .",
    "( 1999 ) also suggest that the percentage of asteroids showing aqueous alteration may decrease with the diameter of the objects , as expected by vilas & sykes ( 1996 ) and proven by rivkin ( 2012 ) and fornasier et al .",
    "( 2014 ) on a large sample of primitive main belt asteroids .",
    "the study presented in this paper and in fornasier et al .",
    "( 2014 ) indicates a much lower percentage of hydration in the themis family ( @xmath9 20% ) , while just one out of the 45 themis and beagle small members studied by kaluna et al .",
    "( 2016 ) shows the 0.7 @xmath1 m absorption band . moreover the meteorite spectral matches found by us and in the literature point towards a similarity of themis - beagle family members with the cv3-cm2 chondrites , the meteorites having experienced aqueous alteration processes ( see section 3.3 ; clark et al .",
    "2010 ; de lon et al .",
    "+ the above results support the view that at least part of the parent body of the themis family was thermally altered and that the distribution of compositions could be attributed to fragments coming from different depths in the original parent body , which was catastrophically disrupted by a large projectile .",
    "+ in this scenario , the beagle family may have been originated by a fragment of a blue and bright piece of themis parent body possibly coming from its interior .",
    "+      marzari et al .",
    "( 1995 ) modeled the collisional evolution of the themis family .",
    "their best results yield parent body and projectile radii of 380 km and 190 km , respectively .",
    "they suggest that the two bodies were not formed in the same region and had different compositions .",
    "since the projectile body was relatively large , its fragments should be a considerable part of the remnants .",
    "interestingly , florczak et al . ( 1999 ) argue that except for the hydration ( indicated by an absorption centered near 0.7 @xmath1 m ) their visible spectra were homogeneous and they did not favor a different composition between parent body and projectile or significant differentiation .",
    "our visible and near - infrared spectra ( figs .  [ f7 ] and  [ f8 ] ) and those of de len et al . ( 2012 ) and kaluna et al . ( 2016 ) show a wide and smooth range of behaviors suggestive of a range of compositions among the themis family members .",
    "these results does not necessarily support different compositions between the large projectile and the themis family parent body . instead of a smooth spectral diversity",
    ", one might expect a bi - modal one from a different projectile and parent body composition .",
    "assuming that the parent body of the themis / beagle families was quite homogeneous , the spectral variability seen on _ old _ themis members and the fact the _ young _ beagle members are bluer and with an higher albedo value than the themis ones may be , at least in part , a result of space weathering effects .    in the past 20 years",
    "enormous progress has been reached in the study of space weathering ( sw ) effects on silicates and s - type asteroids .",
    "the so - called ordinary chondrite paradox , that is lack of asteroids similar to the ordinary chondrites , which represent 80% of meteorite falls , has been solved .",
    "these meteorites are now clearly related to s - type asteroids , as proved by direct measurements of the near and hayabusa missions on the near earth asteroids eros and itokawa ( clark et al .",
    "2001 ; noguchi et al .",
    "2011 ) and laboratory experiments on irradiation of silicates / ordinary chondrites ( moroz et al . 1996 ; sasaki et al . 2002 ; brunetto & strazzulla 2005 ; noble et al .",
    "spectral differences between s - type asteroids and ordinary chondrites are caused by space weathering effects , which produce a darkening in the albedo , a reddening of the spectra , and diminish the silicates absorption bands on the asteroids surfaces , exposed to cosmic radiation and solar wind .",
    "+ on the other hand , our understanding of space weathering effects on primitive asteroids is still poor . only few laboratory experiments have been devoted to the investigation of sw effects on low albedo carbonaceous chondrites and on complex organic materials , and they indicate a no linear trend but much more complex effects .",
    "irradiation of transparent organic materials produces firstly redder and lower albedo materials that upon further processing turn flatter - bluishing and darker ( kanuchova et al .",
    "2012 ; moroz et al .",
    "this result is consistent with a recent study that was looking for spectral differences between ch / cgh - types and cm chondrites ( lantz et al .",
    "on the other hand , lazzarin et al .",
    "( 2006 ) expected a global reddening for the whole asteroidal population .",
    "laboratory experiments on carbonaceous chondrites give different results , that is reddening and/or blueing .",
    "some ion irradiations on cv allende and co frontier mountain 95002 ( lazzarin et al .",
    "2006 ) led to reddening and darkening , and this trend is confirmed for the allende meteorite using both ion ( brunetto et al .",
    "2014 ) and laser irradiation ( gillis - davis et al .",
    "+ the laser irradiated cm mighei resulted in spectral reddening ( moroz et al .",
    "2004b ) while laser irradiation on tagish lake showed a blueing effect ( hiroi et al .",
    "vernazza et al .",
    "( 2013 ) performed ion irradiations on tagish lake and observed a strong blueing with argon , while irradiation with he produced only minor spectral changes and a slight reddening at 4 kev dose .",
    "hiroi et al . ( 2013 ) used laser irradiations on a co , a ck , a cm , a ci and tagish lake : the first two present the same behavior as ordinary chondrites while the others show a clear blueing ( but reflectance decreases so that a darkening effect is seen ) .",
    "+ for the cm murchison the results after irradiation are contradictory : keller et al .",
    "( 2015 ) found reddening and darkening of the sample after ion irradiation , matsuoka et al .",
    "( 2015 ) found a blueing and darkening effect with laser irradiation , gillis - davis et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , using again laser irradiation , found a darkening effect but without slope variations , while lantz et al .",
    "( 2015 ) found no clear albedo and slope variations after ion irradiation .",
    "it appears complicated to define a general space weathering trend for the primitive objects when considering the various results of laboratory simulations on carbonaceous chondrites .",
    "that would explain why the few studies on asteroids proposed different conclusions between reddening ( lazzarin et al .",
    "2006 ) and blueing of the slope ( nesvorny et al . 2005",
    "; lantz et al .",
    "here we compare spectra of young and old members of the themis group ( respectively beagle and themis families ) .",
    "starting from the hypothesis that the parent body was homogeneous , the beagle members have been less exposed to the harsh space environment , and so less space weathered compared to themis members .",
    "if this hypothesis is correct , then our observations seem to indicate that the surfaces of the themis family members have the same spectral answer than the s - type asteroids : young beagle members have globally higher albedo and bluer slopes , while most of the older themis members are redder and have a lower albedo value .",
    "a similar conclusion is found by kaluna et al .",
    "( 2016 ) on their analysis of themis and beagle members of similar size , smaller than 15 km . from the mean slopes values of the two families ,",
    "kaluna et al . (",
    "2016 ) estimate a slope reddening of 0.08 @xmath1m@xmath32 in 2.3 gyr for c - complex asteroids .",
    "however , if space weathering effects are the only cause of the spectral diversity between the two families , we would expect a distinct spectral and albedo distribution between old and young asteroids , while our analysis clearly shows that several themis members have albedo and spectral properties similar to the beagle ones ( figure  [ f8 ] ) .",
    "some rejuvenating processes might have taken place ( shestopalov et al .",
    "2013 ) , but they can not solely explain the large percentage of blue and bright themis members observed . + another important point is the timescale needed to space weathering processes to alter asteroid surfaces .",
    "laboratory simulations indicate that solar wind may alter the surfaces in a relatively short timescale , of the order of 10@xmath410@xmath33 years , producing darkening and reddening effects on ordinary chondrites ( strazzulla et al .",
    "2005 ) , on s - type asteroids ( vernazza et al .",
    "2009a , 2009b ) , and on the allende carbonaceous chondrite ( brunetto et al .",
    "this has also been confirmed by the itokawa grain analysis brought back to the earth by the sample return mission hayabusa ( noguchi et al .",
    "if these short timescales turn out to be correct , it is possible that beagle members are old enought to have already experienced some space weathering processes .",
    "all this considered , we can not firmly conclude that the observed spectral diversity is related to space weathering processes . considering the presence of hydrated minerals on some members and the thermal evolution models which suggest a differentiation in the themis / beagle parent body",
    ", we favor the compositional heterogeneity in the original parent body as explanation of the spectral diversity within themis / beagle members , even if we can not exclude that space weathering processes may be responsible of at least part of the spectral differences observed .",
    "in this work we investigate the spectral properties of primitive asteroids belonging to the @xmath8 2 gyr old themis family and to the young ( @xmath9 10 myr ) beagle subcluster within the themis family .",
    "we present new visible and near infrared spectra of 22 themis and 8 beagle families members .",
    "the themis family members show different spectral behaviors including asteroids with blue / neutral and moderately red spectra , while the beagle members have less spectral variability and they are all neutral / blue .",
    "we include in our analysis most of the data available in the literature on themis / beagle families ( a sample of 79 objects ) for a complete analysis of their spectral properties versus physical parameters .",
    "the spectral slope versus albedo distribution clearly shows that beagle members are less red and tend to have an higher albedo value than the themis one . to explain the spectral differences between the two families we propose different interpretations , including heterogeneity in the parent body having a compositional gradient with depth , the survival of projectile fragments having a different composition than the parent body , space weathering effects , or a combination of these .",
    "+ the spectral differences observed between beagle and themis members may be partially attributed to space weathering effects , which would produce on primitive asteroids reddening and darkening , as seen on s - type asteroids .",
    "however , space weathering effects can not solely explain the spectral variety within the two families , first because we observe several themis members having albedo and spectral behaviors similar to the younger beagle members , and second because we need to assume that the parent body of the family was homogeneous",
    ". however , our and literature data show the presence of hydrated minerals on some of the themis members , and a spectral analogy of the themis / beagle members with carbonaceous chondrites having experienced different degrees of aqueous alteration .",
    "these results , together with those from thermal evolution models , indicate that the parent body of the themis family experienced mild thermal metamorphism in the past , with a possible compositional gradient with depth .",
    "we thus favor the compositional heterogeneity in the original parent body as main source of the spectral diversity within themis / beagle members .     + this paper is based on observations made with the italian telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) operated on the island of la palma by the centro galileo galilei of the inaf ( istituto nazionale di astrofisica ) , both located at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos , la palma , spain , of the instituto de astrofisica de canarias . \"",

    "<S> themis is an old and statistically robust asteroid family populating the outer main belt , and resulting from a catastrophic collision that took place 2.5@xmath01.0 gyr ago . within the old themis family </S>",
    "<S> a young sub - family , beagle , formed less than 10 myr ago , has been identified . + we present the results of a spectroscopic survey in the visible and near infrared range of 22 themis and 8 beagle families members . </S>",
    "<S> the themis members investigated exhibit a wide range of spectral behaviors , including asteroids with blue / neutral and moderately red spectra , while the younger beagle family members look spectrally bluer than the themis ones and they have a much smaller spectral slope variability . </S>",
    "<S> four themis members , including ( 24 ) themis , have absorption bands centered at 0.68 - 0.73 @xmath1 m indicating the presence of aqueously altered minerals . </S>",
    "<S> + the best meteorite spectral analogues found for both themis and beagle families members are carbonaceous chondrites having experienced different degrees of aqueous alteration , prevalently cm2 but also cv3 and ci , and some of them are chondrite samples being unusual or heated . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of aqueous altered materials on the asteroids surfaces and the meteorite matches indicate that the parent body of the themis family experienced mild thermal metamorphism in the past . </S>",
    "<S> + we extended the spectral analysis including the data available in the literature on themis and beagle families members , and we looked for correlations between spectral behavior and physical parameters using the albedo and size values derived from the wise data . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of this larger sample confirm the spectral diversity within the themis family and that beagle members tend to be bluer and to have an higher albedo . </S>",
    "<S> the differences between the two family may be partially explained by space weathering processes , which act on these primitive surfaces in a similar way than on s - type asteroids , i.e. producing reddening and darkening . </S>",
    "<S> however we see several themis members having albedos and spectral slopes similar to the young beagle members . </S>",
    "<S> alternative scenarios are proposed including heterogeneity in the parent body having a compositional gradient with depth , and/or the survival of projectile fragments having a different composition than the parent body .    </S>",
