    "the purpose of this paper is to show that certain stochastic integrals have the _ conditional full support _ property , introduced by guasoni , rsonyi , and schachermayer @xcite .",
    "so , before stating the main results of this paper , let us recall the definition of this property .",
    "to this end , recall first that when @xmath5 is a separable metric space and @xmath6 $ ] is a borel probability measure , the _ support _ of @xmath7 , denoted by @xmath8 , is the ( unique ) minimal closed set @xmath9 such that @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath11}$ ] be a continuous stochastic process taking values in an open interval @xmath12 , defined on a complete probability space @xmath13 , and let @xmath14}$ ] be a filtration on this space .",

    "we say that the process @xmath20 has _",
    "conditional full support _ ( cfs ) with respect to the filtration @xmath21 , or briefly @xmath21-cfs , if    a.   @xmath20 is adapted to @xmath21 , b.   for all @xmath22 and @xmath23-almost all @xmath24 , @xmath25}\\big| \\mathscr{f}_{t}\\big](\\omega)\\big ) = c_{x_{t}(\\omega)}([t , t],i).\\ ] ]    in , we regard @xmath26}\\big| \\mathscr{f}_{t}\\big]$ ] as a regular conditional law ( a random borel probability measure , see e.g.  @xcite ) on the space @xmath27,i)$ ] . arguably , the formulation of the cfs property might appear slightly complicated at first sight , but informally it simply means that when we observe @xmath20 from any time @xmath28 onwards , @xmath20 still stays arbitrarily close to any continuous path in @xmath29 starting from @xmath30 with a positive @xmath31-conditional probability .    throughout this paper ,",
    "when we say that some process has cfs without mentioning the filtration , we tacitly take it to be the natural filtration of the process .",
    "in fact , this is the `` weakest form '' of cfs that a process can have ( see corollary [ smallerfilt ] and lemma [ usual ] ) .",
    "we shall establish cfs for processes of the form @xmath32,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is a continuous process , the integrator @xmath1 is a brownian motion , and the integrand @xmath33 satisfies some varying assumptions ( to be clarified below ) .",
    "we focus on three cases , each of which requires a separate treatment .",
    "first , we study the case :    1 .",
    "[ caseindep ] @xmath2 and @xmath33 are ( jointly ) independent of @xmath1 .",
    "we find that in this case , @xmath4 has cfs if the set of zeros of @xmath34 has zero lebesgue measure almost surely ( theorem [ indepcfs ] ) . as an application of this result",
    ", we show that several popular _ stochastic volatility",
    "_ models  which feature leverage effects , long memory in volatility , and volatility jumps  have the cfs property .",
    "next , we relax the assumption about independence , and consider the case :    1 .",
    "[ casedep ] @xmath2 and @xmath33 depend progressively on @xmath1 and some additional continuous process that does not anticipate @xmath1 ; and @xmath35 is absolutely continuous .",
    "it turns out that in this case the simple sufficient condition of the preceeding case does not guarantee cfs",
    " we present a very simple example , in which @xmath33 is stricly positive but @xmath4 fails to have cfs .",
    "however , we show that under a set of more stringent assumptions  which are satisfied e.g.  when @xmath33 is bounded from above and away from zero , and @xmath36 is bounded ",
    "the process @xmath4 does have cfs ( theorem [ progcfs ] ) . using this result , we are able to establish cfs for the solutions of certain stochastic differential equations . finally , we consider briefly the following ( partial ) extension of the case :    1 .   [ casegen ]",
    "a ( general ) continuous process @xmath20 with cfs takes place of @xmath1 ; processes @xmath2 and @xmath33 are ( jointly ) independent of @xmath20 ; and @xmath33 is of finite variation .",
    "we show that in this case , @xmath4 has cfs if each path of @xmath33 is bounded away from zero ( theorem [ gencfs ] ) .      as mentioned before , the cfs property was first introduced by guasoni , rsonyi , and schachermayer @xcite , in connection to mathematical finance , viz .",
    "pricing models with _",
    "transaction costs_. their main result asserts that if a continuous price process has cfs , then for any @xmath37 there exists a so - called _",
    "@xmath38-consistent price system _ , which is a martingale ( after an equivalent change of measure ) that shadows the price process within the bid  ask spread implied by @xmath38-sized proportional transaction costs ( see also @xcite for a related study ) .",
    "the existence of @xmath38-consistent price systems for all @xmath39 implies that the price process does not admit arbitrage opportunities under arbitrary small transaction costs  since any arbitrage strategy would generate arbitrage also in the consistent price system , which is a contradiction because of the martingale property .",
    "consistent price systems can be seen as generalizations of _ equivalent martingale measures _ ( emm s ) , since if a price process admits an emm , then the price process itself qualifies as a trivial @xmath38-consistent price system for any @xmath37 .",
    "however , cfs is worth studying even when it comes to price processes that admit emm s , since it enables the construction of specific consistent price systems that are useful in solving _ superreplication _",
    "problems under proportional transaction costs .",
    "this is manifested by the `` face - lifting '' result in @xcite , which says that if @xmath40}$ ] is a price process with cfs , then the superreplication price of any european - style vanilla contingent claim @xmath41 under @xmath38-sized proportional transaction costs tends to @xmath42 when @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the _ concave envelope _ of @xmath45 ( informally , the `` smallest '' concave function that majorizes @xmath45 ) .",
    "this means that superreplicating e.g.  a european call option under small proportional transaction costs entails buying the underlying , the trivial superreplicating portfolio .",
    "in addition models with transaction costs , cfs has been found to be have relevance also to frictionless pricing models , as indicated in the recent paper of bender , sottinen , and valkeila @xcite .",
    "their result asserts that if a continuous price process has cfs ( they use the name _ conditional small ball property _ ) and _ pathwise quadratic variation _",
    ", then it does not admit arbitrage opportunities in a class of trading strategies that is somewhat narrower than what the classical models allow , but nevertheless covers a large share ( if not almost all ) of the strategies that have practical relevance .",
    "aside from having these applications in mathematical finance , cfs is an interesting fundamental property from a purely mathematical point of view .",
    "in particular , research on the cfs property can be seen as a natural continuation to the classical studies of the supports of the laws of continuous gaussian processes , by kallianpur @xcite , and diffusions , initiated by stroock and varadhan @xcite and continued by several other authors ( see e.g.  @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "so far , a variety of continuous processes , which are non - degenerate in some sense , have been shown to have cfs .",
    "gaussian processes that have cfs include _ fractional brownian motion _ , with any hurst index @xmath46 ( and specifically when @xmath47 , _ standard _ brownian motion ) @xcite , and more generally all _ brownian moving averages _ with non - vanishing kernels @xcite . moreover , gaussian processes with _ stationary increments _ that satisfy a certain spectral density condition have cfs @xcite .",
    "in the case of continuous markov processes , showing cfs reduces to showing that the support of the ( unconditional ) law of the process is the largest possible , as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "hence , the classical results concerning the supports of diffusions ( e.g.  @xcite ) can be used to establish cfs .",
    "moreover , it was shown in @xcite , that if continuous process @xmath20 has cfs , then the riemann integral process @xmath48 has cfs , which allows ( using iteration ) the construction of processes that have cfs and arbitrarily smooth paths .",
    "while many examples of common gaussian and markovian processes have cfs , this observation should not be extrapolated too much , since cfs is a not a trivial property , due to its _ functional _ nature .",
    "for example , non - degeneracy of finite dimensional conditional laws does not typically , even in the case of gaussian processes , guarantee cfs .",
    "a striking example of this difficulty is the continuous gaussian process @xmath49}$ ] constructed by cherny ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 3.1 ) , which satisfies @xmath50>0 $ ] a.s .  for all @xmath51 $ ] such that @xmath52 , but nevertheless @xmath53 almost surely  implying that @xmath20 can not have cfs .",
    "section [ basicresults ] contains some basic results on the cfs property , to familiarize the reader with the property , and to facilitate subsequent proofs .",
    "section [ mainresults ] contains the main results concerning stochastic integrals .",
    "finally , section [ applications ] concludes with applications to the aforementioned more specific processes : stochastic volatility models and solutions of stochastic differential equations .",
    "let @xmath54 be a left - closed interval and @xmath55 a generic stochastic process on @xmath56 .",
    "we say that @xmath20 is _ jointly measurable _ , if @xmath57 is measurable with respect to @xmath58 . throughout this paper , we assume implicitly that all processes are jointly measurable , whenever this is not already implied by continuity ( from left or right ) or progressive measurability . for any @xmath59 , we write @xmath60 .",
    "we denote by @xmath61 the `` raw '' natural filtration of @xmath20 and by @xmath62 its usual augmentation ( the minimal right - continuous augmentation of @xmath63 such that @xmath64 contains all @xmath23-null sets in @xmath65 for all @xmath59 , see e.g.  @xcite ) .    as usual",
    ", @xmath66 denotes the sup - norm , and for any @xmath67 and @xmath68 , write @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    finally , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 stands for the lebesgue measure on @xmath76 .",
    "since cfs is a very recent concept , in the absence of any comprehensive account , it is instructive to present a few basic results that can be used to establish the property .",
    "we will consider processes and their cfs in the largest possible state space @xmath76 , but this is not really a restriction , since all of the following results , except lemma [ smallballprobs ] , can be applied also to processes in smaller state spaces using the following observation .",

    "hence , for @xmath82 , understood as a process in @xmath29 , we have @xmath83    we begin with an alternative `` small - ball '' characterization of cfs , which is more tractable than the original definition .    [ smallballprobs ]",

    ", so is clearly equivalent to the asserted condition .    while lemma [ smallballprobs ] is somewhat obvious , it has two very important consequences .",
    "firstly , we note that the characterization is stated in terms of conditional _",
    "expectations_. hence , cfs does not hinge on any particular choice of _ versions _ of the regular conditional _",
    "laws_.    secondly , whenever we want to argue contrapositively and assume that the cfs property fails to hold , lemma [ smallballprobs ] guarantees that there exists a _ fixed _",
    "ball @xmath97 such that @xmath98 exits @xmath97 with positive probability .",
    "ignoring separability , the definition of cfs alone would then only imply existence of a _ random _",
    "balls @xmath99 with the same property , which would cause certain complications ( primarily , the need to find a measurable selection of these balls ) .",
    "thus , establishing cfs reduces to checking that certain conditional expectations are positive .",
    "it is sometimes easier to show positivity of a conditional expectation by arguing that the analogous conditional expectation with respect to some _ larger _",
    "@xmath100-algebra is positive , and then pass to the original @xmath100-algebra using the following elementary fact .",

    "we find that , like the semimartingale property , cfs is preserved when the filtration is shrinked , as long as the process is adapted to the smaller filtration ( this observation is not really new , it was already employed e.g.  in @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "then , @xmath20 has @xmath21-cfs if and only if it has cfs with respect to the usual augmentation of @xmath21 .",
    "the `` if '' part follows from corollary [ smallerfilt ] . moreover , for the `` only if '' part , it follows from a simple monotone class argument that adding the @xmath23-null sets in @xmath114 to the filtration does not alter conditional expectations , and hence by lemma [ smallballprobs ] , cfs remains intact .",
