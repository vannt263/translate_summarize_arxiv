    "<S> , we account for the fact that @xmath23 contributes only to the scanned - source correlations and set @xmath26 for fitting the single - source data ; also , since the detector geometry is the same for both experiments , @xmath24 is constrained to have a common value for the two curves . </S>",
    "<S> note that for white - noise uncorrelated disorder and point - like source and detector in an infinite disordered medium , @xmath27 @xcite . in our experiments , however , both the source and detector have finite extent ( which differs in each case @xcite ) , and the finite size of the aluminum beads inevitably results in some short - range structural correlations . therefore , we expect in general that @xmath28 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : spatcorr1 ] provides strong evidence that the large asymptotic value of @xmath29 for the scanned - source experiment is due to @xmath0 correlations .    </S>",

    "<S> the uncertainties are given by the standard deviation of the parameters . </S>",
    "<S> for a point source and detector , the normalized variance , @xmath30 , depends on all three parameters : @xmath31 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the infinite range contributions depend independently on the different contributions to @xmath0 , with the asymptotic values of the scanned - source @xmath32 , the single - source @xmath33 , and the scanned - source @xmath33 being equal to @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath34 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the experiments were performed in a water tank to capitalize on the flexibility of ultrasonic immersion transducer technology for controlling source and detector positions . </S>",
    "<S> a focused ultrasonic pulse was incident on the sample , and the transmitted waves were measured in the near field on the opposite side using a miniature hydrophone detector . a schematic representation of the experimental configuration is shown in fig .  [ fig : expsetup ] .     </S>",
    "<S> schematic diagram showing experimental setup.,width=321 ]    because we are interested in measuring ultrasonic transport through the solid elastic network of aluminum beads , the samples were mounted into acrylic holders and sealed with thin plastic walls to prevent water from entering the pore space surrounding the beads ; hence , within the pores , only air ( for the measurements at 2.4 mhz ) or vacuum ( for the lower frequency measurements between 0.5 and 1.5 mhz ) was present . </S>",
    "<S> to ensure good acoustic coupling between the front and back sample surfaces and the flat waterproofing walls , the walls were coated with a very thin layer of an ultrasonic couplant .    </S>",
    "<S> the ultrasonic pulse was generated by focusing immersion transducers , which have front surfaces that are curved to act as a lens . </S>",
    "<S> the central frequencies of the transducers were either 1.0 or 2.25  mhz . </S>",
    "<S> the transducers were designed to have a focal length of approximately 30  cm , and a conical screen with a small aperture was placed at the focus to remove any side lobes or other beam artifacts . </S>",
    "<S> this large focal distance was selected to enable the multiply scattered , transmitted signals to be recorded before the arrival of any spurious echoes that had reverberated back and forth between the transducer and sample . </S>",
    "<S> note also that this large focal distance ensured that the source was temporally decoupled from the sample , since the time interval between the emission of the pulse at the transducer and its arrival at the sample surface is very much longer than the incident pulse width . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the pulse incident on the sample surface was a constant amplitude pressure pulse , with magnitude and bandwidth that was independent of the ldos at the focal spot . </S>",
    "<S> this type of source has the advantage of simplicity for investigating the effect of ldos fluctuations at the input surface on the intensity correlations of the transmitted signals , although its nature is quite different to sources in optics that have been used to investigate ldos fluctuations themselves via the strong coupling that exists in the photonic environment around the sources and scatterers @xcite . in our experiments , for each source / detector location , the pulse was repeated several thousand times at a repetition rate of several hundred hertz ( slow enough to ensure that all signals due to the previous pulse had died completely away ) , so that the recorded signals could be averaged to improve the signal - to - noise ratio .    </S>",
    "<S> the conical screen was wrapped in teflon tape to make it acoustically opaque . </S>",
    "<S> the cone shape was chosen so that edges of the focused beam could be effectively blocked when the aperture was placed close to the sample , while at the same time preventing significant stray sound being reflected back towards the sample from the screen . </S>",
    "<S> the pressure field at the source plane ( about 1  mm from the aperture ) was mapped using the hydrophone detector , so that the spatial extent of the source spot on the sample surface could be determined . </S>",
    "<S> the recorded signals were fourier transformed and the intensity maps at each frequency were fit to a gaussian in order to determine the source size . </S>",
    "<S> the results of these measurements are shown in table  [ tab : params ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that the focal spot size at each frequency is significantly less than the wavelength inside the sample , and comparable to one wavelength in water .    </S>",
    "<S> the hydrophone used in these experiments is a sub - wavelength phase - sensitive detector with an active element diameter of @xmath35 m . </S>",
    "<S> the hydrophone has a needle - like shape , which serves to minimize reflections back to the sample . in our experiments , the hydrophone was placed approximately 1  mm from the sample surface ( less than one wavelength in water ) , and thereby records the near - field transmission with good spatial resolution . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity correlations of the transmitted ultrasonic waves were determined by first taking the fourier transform of the recorded pressure fields @xmath36 and squaring the magnitude of the fourier transforms to obtain signals that are proportional to the ultrasonic intensity at each frequency . </S>",
    "<S> two types of experiments were performed in order to isolate the contributions to the intensity correlations of fluctuations in the local density of states at the source positions . </S>",
    "<S> the first set of experiments was designed to directly measure the @xmath0 correlations due to these ldos fluctuations at the source . in these experiments , </S>",
    "<S> the transmitted signals were recorded at 13 detector positions for each source location . in order to get good statistics </S>",
    "<S> , the sample was scanned to have the source focused on over 3000 independent locations . </S>",
    "<S> for each pair of detector positions , the correlations were calculated for all source locations , and the results of the correlations for similar values of @xmath12 were binned and averaged together . in the second set of experiments , which were designed to suppress these @xmath0 correlations , </S>",
    "<S> over 3000 detector positions were used for a single source location . </S>",
    "<S> correlations were calculated for every possible pair of detector positions , and results for similar values of @xmath12 were again binned . </S>",
    "<S> this experiment was repeated for seven independent source locations , and the results of each of these experiments were averaged together . </S>"
