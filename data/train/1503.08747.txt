    "the standard approach to cosmological modelling is a top - down one in which the first step is to solve for the homogeneous and isotropic large - scale expansion .",
    "small fluctuations on large scales are then included using first - order perturbation theory @xcite , and large fluctuations on small scales are included by appealing to newtonian theory @xcite .",
    "this approach has many features that commend it as a good way to build cosmological models . among the foremost of these",
    "is the mathematical simplicity involved at every step , as well as the fact that the resulting model has been found to be consistent with a wide array of cosmological observations ( as long as dark matter and dark energy are allowed to be included )",
    ".    nevertheless , while the top - down approach is simple and functional , it is not necessarily self - consistent or well - defined .",
    "this is because the standard approach assumes , from the outset , that the large - scale expansion of a statistically homogeneous and isotropic universe can be accurately modelled using a single homogeneous and isotropic solution of einstein s equations .",
    "it is far from obvious that such an assumption should be valid , as einstein s equations are non - linear , and because it has not yet been possible to find a unique and mathematically well - defined way of averaging tensors .",
    "this makes it extremely difficult to assess the effect that the formation of structure has on the large - scale expansion of the universe , without assuming that it is small from the outset .",
    "this is known as the ``back - reaction '' problem , which , despite much study , has uncertain consequences for the actual universe @xcite .",
    "part of the difficulty with the investigation of the back - reaction problem is that it is hard to do cosmology without first assuming that the geometry of the universe can be treated ( to at least a first approximation ) as being a homogeneous and isotropic solution of einstein s equations .",
    "this is , unfortunately , assuming the thing that one wants to question in the first place , which is obviously not ideal .",
    "the problems with studying back - reaction in the standard top - down approach to cosmological modelling become increasingly apparent if one allows small - scale perturbations to the homogeneous and isotropic background . on small scales density contrasts",
    "must become highly non - linear , and extrapolation from the linear regime ( which is assumed to be valid on large scales ) can result in divergences @xcite . on the other hand , appealing to the newtonian theory results in a situation where the perturbations to the metric contribute terms to the field equations that are at least as large as the terms that come from the dynamical background , making the perturbative expansion",
    "itself poorly defined @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report on an approach that side - steps all of these difficulties .",
    "we construct cosmological models from the bottom up , by taking regions of perturbed minkowski space , and patching them together using the appropriate junction conditions .",
    "we take the boundaries between these regions to be reflection symmetric , in order to make the problem tractable .",
    "the model that results is a space - time that is periodic , and statistically homogeneous and isotropic on large scales , while being highly inhomogeneous and anisotropic on small scales .",
    "the equations that govern the large - scale expansion of the space are determined up to post - newtonian accuracy .",
    "the newtonian - order equations reproduce the expected behaviour of a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) model filled with pressureless dust , while to post - newtonian order we find new terms that appear in the effective friedmann equations . for the case of a single mass at the centre of each region",
    ", these terms all take the form of either dust or radiation .    with a new generation of galaxy surveys on the horizon , that have the promise to map the structure in the universe to unprecedented levels @xcite",
    ", it becomes increasingly important to understand the relativistic corrections that could be required in order to accurately interpret the data that results . to this end ,",
    "higher - order corrections in perturbation theory are already being calculated ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our framework provides a way of consistently and simultaneously tracking the effects of relativistic gravity in both the regime of non - linear density contrasts , and in the large - scale cosmological expansion . a proper understanding of these effects is required to ensure we understand all possible sources of error that could arise in the interpretation of the data , and",
    "also if we are to use the data to test and understand einstein s theory , and the dark components of the universe .",
    "our models do not rely on any assumptions about the large - scale expansion being well - modelled by any homogeneous and isotropic solutions of einstein s equations .",
    "they are also well defined on small scales , as they are explicitly constructed from the post - newtonian expansions that are routinely used to study the weak - field and slow - motion limit of general relativity .",
    "we are therefore able to model non - linear structure within the context of a cosmological model without falling foul of any of the problems outlined above ( and that appear to be inherent in any top - down approach to cosmological modelling ) .",
    "the large - scale expansion of our model simply emerges , as a consequence of the junction conditions .",
    "we do not have to make any assumptions about the averaging of tensors , and do not have to assume anything about the existence of any background cosmology .",
    "other recent approaches to bottom - up cosmological modelling include the application of geometrostatics to cosmology @xcite , as well as numerical relativity techniques @xcite , perturbative approximation schemes @xcite , and the re - discovery of the lindquist - wheeler models @xcite .",
    "these studies have allowed the evolution of subspaces to be calculated @xcite , numerical approximations to both the space - time and the optical properties of the space - time to be determined @xcite , and the proof of interesting results such as the limit of many particles approaching a fluid @xcite , and the non - perturbative nature of some structures @xcite .",
    "our study extends these previous ones , we believe , by allowing increased flexibility for the distribution of matter , while maintaining a high degree of mathematical simplicity .    in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we introduce the post - newtonian formalism that we will use throughout the rest of the paper . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we then explain how we will apply the junction conditions , in order to build a cosmological model from regions described using the post - newtonian approximation to gravity .",
    "section [ sec4 ] contains a detailed presentation of the field equations and the junction conditions , both expanded to post - newtonian levels of accuracy . in section [ sec5 ] we then manipulate these equations into a form that can be used to determine the motion of the boundaries of each of our regions , and hence the expansion of the global space - time .",
    "we then proceed , in section [ sec6 ] , to explain how the general solution to the global expansion can be calculated , for arbitrary distributions of matter , as well as for the special case of a single mass at the centre of each region . in both cases",
    "the lowest - order newtonian - level solution to the equations of motion give a large - scale expansion that is similar to the dust dominated homogeneous and isotropic solutions of einstein s equations . to post - newtonian order we find that , for the case of isolated masses , the only new terms that appear in the effective friedmann equation look like dust and radiation . after that , in section [ sec7 ] , we transform our solutions so that they are written as the evolution of proper distances in proper time , and on time - dependent backgrounds .",
    "we also consider the calculation of observables in these models .",
    "finally , in section [ sec8 ] , we conclude .",
    "we will use greek letters ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , ... ) to denote spatial indices , and latin letters ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , ... ) to denote space - time indices .",
    "we reserve the latter part of the latin alphabet ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , ... ) for the indices on the @xmath9-dimensional hypersurfaces that will form the boundaries of each of our regions of space .",
    "capital latin letters ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , ... ) denote the spatial components of tensors on these boundaries . as usual , a comma will be used to denote a partial derivative , such that @xmath13 where @xmath14 here is a time coordinate , and @xmath15 denotes any arbitrary function on space - time .",
    "covariant derivatives will be represented by semi - colons .",
    "the equations of general relativity are known to reduce to those of newtonian gravity in the limit of slow motions ( @xmath16 ) and weak gravitational fields ( @xmath17 ) . in the solar system , for example , gravity is weak enough for newton s theory to adequately explain almost all phenomena .",
    "however , there are certain effects that can only be explained using relativistic gravity .",
    "these include , for example , the shift in the perihelion of mercury , which requires the use of relativistic gravity .",
    "to describe such situations it is useful to consider post - newtonian gravitational physics .    the post - newtonian formalism is essentially based on small fluctuations around minkowski space . both the geometry of space - time , and the components of the energy - momentum tensor , are then treated perturbatively , with an expansion parameter @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the 3-velocity associated with the matter fields , and @xmath5 is the speed of light .",
    "the first step in the post - newtonian formalism is to associate all quantities with an  order of smallness \" in @xmath20 .",
    "this is done for newtonian and post - newtonian gravitational potentials , as well as for every component of the energy - momentum tensor .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we will outline the post - newtonian expansion , and the quantities that are useful for solving the equations that result .",
    "much of our discussion closely follows that of will @xcite . from this point on",
    "we will work in units where @xmath21 , unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "general relativity tells us that the curvature of space - time is directly related to its energy - momentum content by einstein s equations : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the ricci tensor , @xmath24 is the metric of space - time , @xmath25 is newton s constant , @xmath26 is the energy - momentum tensor ( dependent on the matter content of the universe ) , and @xmath27 is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "these are a set of ten non - linear partial differential equations in four variables .    in the vicinity of weakly gravitating systems we take the metric to be given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the metric of minkowski space , and @xmath30 are perturbations to that metric .",
    "we also take the energy - momentum tensor to be given by @xmath31 where @xmath0 is the energy density of the matter fields measured by an observer following @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the isotropic pressure , and @xmath34 is a time - like unit 4-vector , given by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the proper time along the integral curves of @xmath34 , and where @xmath34 is normalized such that @xmath37 .",
    "anisotropic pressure could have been included in eq . , but would only appear at @xmath38 in @xmath39 , and @xmath40 in the equation of motion of time - like particles .",
    "this is beyond the level of accuracy used in this paper , and so we do not include it here",
    ". we can now expand @xmath30 , @xmath0 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 in orders of @xmath20 , and relate the resultant quantities to each other via eq . .",
    "to begin this we first note that , in the post - newtonian formalism , time derivatives add an extra degree of smallness to the object they operate on , as compared to spatial derivatives .",
    "this follows because the time variations of the metric and energy - momentum tensors are taken to be a result of the motion of the matter in the space - time , such that @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the 3-velocity of the matter fields , and @xmath15 is any space and time dependent function in the system ( such as one of the components of @xmath30 or @xmath26 ) .    to find the lowest - order part of @xmath43 we note that the leading - order part of the equation of motion for a time - like particle takes the same form as in newtonian theory",
    "that is , @xmath44 . as @xmath45",
    ", we therefore have that the leading - order part of @xmath43 is @xmath46 similar considerations lead to the conclusion that the leading - order part of the spatial components of the metric are given by @xmath47 while those of the @xmath48-components are given by @xmath49 the next - to - leading - order parts of each of these components is @xmath50 smaller than the leading - order part , in every case .",
    "similarly , the lowest - order part of @xmath0 can be determined from the leading - order part of the @xmath51-component of eq . .",
    "this takes the form of the newton - poisson equation , @xmath52 , so that the lowest - order part of @xmath0 can be seen to be @xmath53 here , and throughout , we have chosen units such that spatial derivatives do not change the order - of - smallness of the object on which they operate . to find the lowest - order contribution to the pressure we can consider the conservation of energy - momentum , @xmath54",
    "the lowest - order part of the spatial component of these equations is @xmath55 , from which it can be seen that @xmath56 again , the next - to - leading - order part of the energy density is @xmath50 smaller than the leading - order part , while the higher - order corrections to the pressure will not be required for what follows .      in order to solve the equations of both newtonian and post - newtonian gravitational physics it is useful to define some potentials , as well as make some identifications for the components of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the first of these involves the leading - order part of the energy density , which we write as @xmath57 where @xmath2 is the density of mass . here , and throughout , a superscript in brackets denotes a quantity s order - of - smallness in @xmath20 . the next - to - leading order part of the energy density is then written as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is known as the the specific energy density . in",
    "what follows , we will also use @xmath60 to denote the spatial components of @xmath32 at lowest order .",
    "using @xmath2 we can define the first of our potentials , which is simply the newtonian gravitational potential , defined implicitly as the solution to @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the 3-dimensional laplacian operator of flat space .",
    "the reason for defining the potential in this way is very simple : it allows us to write the solution to @xmath63 as @xmath64 . at this point",
    "the `` solution '' for @xmath43 is little more than a change of notation ( with obvious historical significance ) .",
    "when it comes to post - newtonian potentials , however , the equations become much more complicated .",
    "this change of notation is then much more useful , especially if the potentials that we define are simply solutions to poisson s equations .    with this in mind",
    ", it is useful to make the following implicit definitions for new gravitational potentials @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in what follows , we will not require any potentials of order higher than @xmath70 .",
    "when applying the post - newtonian formalism to isolated gravitational systems , such as the sun , it is usual to assume that the space - time is asymptotically flat .",
    "this allows the boundary terms of green s functions to be neglected , so that the solutions to poisson s equation are given by simple integrals over spatial volumes .",
    "this simplicity is a substantial benefit when solving for the potentials defined in the equations above . in the case of a cosmological model ,",
    "however , we can not assume asymptotic flatness .",
    "we must , therefore , be more careful with the boundary terms .",
    "the equations we want to solve take the form of the poisson equation , @xmath71 where @xmath15 is now being used to denote a potential , and where @xmath72 is some function on space - time ( such as the mass density ) . to solve this equation we consider the green s function , @xmath73",
    ", that satisfies @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 denote spatial positions , where @xmath77 is the dirac delta function , and where @xmath78 is a constant over spatial hypersurfaces ( the need for @xmath78 in this equation will become apparent shortly ) .",
    "we want to solve eq . over a spatial volume @xmath79 , with boundary @xmath80 . the green s function we will use for this must , of course , satisfy gauss theorem on this domain , such that @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the unit - vector normal to the boundary . if we now choose @xmath83 as the boundary condition for @xmath84 , then eqs . and",
    "imply @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the spatial volume of the cell .",
    "the solution to eq .",
    "is then given , in terms of @xmath84 , by considering @xmath87 \\ dv\\nonumber \\\\ & = \\int_{\\omega } [ \\nabla \\cdot ( \\mathcal{g } \\nabla \\varphi ) -\\nabla \\cdot ( \\varphi \\nabla \\mathcal{g } ) + \\varphi \\nabla^2 \\mathcal{g } ] \\",
    "dv\\nonumber   \\\\ & = \\int_{\\omega } \\nabla \\cdot ( \\mathcal{g } \\nabla \\varphi-   \\varphi \\nabla \\mathcal{g } ) \\ dv - \\varphi + \\bar{\\varphi } \\ , , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is a constant over @xmath79 .",
    "rearranging , the potential @xmath15 can be seen to be given by @xmath89 where we have again made use of the boundary condition @xmath83 .    if one were now to assume that @xmath15 was asymptotically flat , then the first and last terms on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "would vanish .",
    "the green s function would then take the form of the newton kernel , such that @xmath90 however , these assumptions are not true in general , and especially not in the case of cosmological modelling .",
    "this is because cosmological models do not have asymptotically flat regions , by their very definition . in what follows",
    ", we must therefore be more careful .",
    "we have to specify appropriate boundary conditions for our potentials , and include the boundary terms in eq . , if we are to use the green s function formalism to determine the form of our gravitational potentials .",
    "in this paper we will take a bottom - up approach to cosmological modelling .",
    "this will involve considering cosmological models that are constructed from large numbers of cells , that can be put next to each other to form a periodic lattice structure .",
    "the shape of each cell will be taken to be a regular polyhedron , and will be assumed to be identical to every other cell , up to rotations , reflections and translations .    the physical systems that we intend to model with these cells will depend on the size of cell that we are considering .",
    "for example , for cells that are approximately the size of the homogeneity scale ( about 100 mpc ) , we could consider modelling clusters of galaxies , as illustrated in fig .",
    "other systems , such as individual galaxies , could equally well be modelled with cell sizes of the order of about 1 mpc .",
    "the only requirement we have is that the system must satisfy the requirements of the post - newtonian formalism .",
    "specifically , this means that @xmath91 and @xmath92 , so that the bulk of the interior of each cell is described by newtonian and post - newtonian gravitational physics .",
    "the post - newtonian formalism is expected to work well in the regime of non - linear density contrasts , and so should be expected to be adequate for modelling most aspects of the gravitational fields of galaxies and clusters of galaxies .",
    "this formalism is , however , limited to scales much smaller than the cosmological horizon .",
    "we therefore require each of our cells to be much smaller than the hubble radius , @xmath93",
    ". a violation of this requirement would result in matter at the boundary of a cell moving at close to the speed of light .",
    "we also assume each cell is filled with normal matter , so that pressures are small with respect to energy densities .",
    "we note that the post - newtonian framework can not , and should not , be used to describe multiple cells simultaneously . however , due to the periodicity of our lattice structure , we only need to know the space - time geometry of any one cell , and its boundary conditions with neighbouring cells . as we will show below , this information is sufficient to tell us how we should expect the entire universe to evolve .",
    "let us now turn to a more detailed consideration of the conditions required in order to join two cells together at a boundary .",
    "first and foremost , the cells must satisfy certain smoothness requirements across their respective boundaries , known as the israel junction conditions , if their union is to be a solution to einstein s equations .",
    "these conditions , in the absence of surface layers , are given by @xcite @xmath94 & = 0 \\ ,   \\label{gamma } \\\\",
    "[ { k}_{ij } ] & = 0 \\ , , \\label{19}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 = \\varphi^{(+ ) } - \\varphi^{(-)}$ ] denotes the jump across the boundary for any quantity @xmath15 , and the @xmath6 and @xmath7 indices denote tensor components on the boundary .",
    "the @xmath96 and @xmath97 superscripts here show that a quantity is to be evaluated on either side of the boundary ( i.e. on the sides labelled by @xmath98 or @xmath99 , respectively ) .    in these equations , @xmath100 is the induced metric on the boundary , and @xmath101 is the extrinsic curvature of the boundary , defined by @xmath102 and @xmath103 where @xmath104 denotes the coordinates on the boundary , and @xmath105 is the space - like unit vector normal to the boundary .     two adjacent cubic cells , with example matter content , consisting of filaments and voids .",
    "the second cell is the mirror image of the first .",
    "this figure was produced using an image from @xcite.,width=321 ]    in our construction we choose to consider reflection symmetric boundaries .",
    "the israel junction conditions can then be simplified .",
    "the situation we wish to consider is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , for two cubic cells .",
    "we use @xmath106 and @xmath107 to denote the coordinates used within the first and second cells , respectively .",
    "reflection symmetry means that eq .",
    "is automatically satisfied .",
    "the second junction condition , given by eq .",
    ", can be written as @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are outward and inward pointing normals , in the first and second cells , respectively .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "now , mirror symmetry implies that @xmath111 .",
    "symmetry therefore demands that @xmath112 this implies that @xmath113 , or , in other words , that the extrinsic curvature must vanish on the boundary of every cell , i.e. @xmath114 this equation must be satisfied on each and every boundary in our lattice .     a schematic diagram showing the normal vectors involved in the junction conditions , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",

    "so far , we have only calculated coordinate distances , in terms of coordinate time . in this section",
    "we will transform these quantities into proper distances and proper time .",
    "we will then perform a coordinate transformation that allows the space - time within each cell to be written as perturbations on a homogeneous and isotropic robertson - walker background . finally , we will work out the expansion rates of our cell edges in this new description .",
    "this will allow us the clearest possible comparison with standard friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmological models .",
    "as an example , we will sometimes use the model described in section [ sec6b ] .",
    "similar analyses can be performed for other configurations , by adjusting the calculations that follow .",
    "for our example cubic cell , we choose to consider an edge defined by the intersection of cell faces at @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "the proper length of such a curve , in a hypersurface of constant @xmath121 , is given by @xmath122 expanding this expression , and taking the locations of the relevant corners of the cell to be at @xmath123 , then gives @xmath124 using eqs . and , it can be seen that @xmath125 where @xmath126 is being used here to denote the coordinate distance between the centres of two cell faces , on opposite sides of our cubic cell .",
    "using the solution derived in section [ sec6b ] , we can numerically evaluated the integral in eq .",
    ", between the limits specified in eq . , to find @xmath127 using this result , the friedmann - like equation can then be written as @xmath128 the functional form of this equation is obviously unaltered , with only a small additional contribution to the radiation - like term .",
    "let us now write this equation in terms of proper time , @xmath36 , of an observer following the boundary at the corner of the cell . in this case",
    "coordinate time can be related to proper time using the normalisation of the 4-velocity tangent to the boundary , @xmath129 , so that @xmath130 where all terms are to be evaluated at the corner of the cell , and where the observer has been taken to be moving with velocity equal to @xmath131 in each of the @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134-directions .",
    "this equation can be re - written using the solution in section [ sec6b ] , to find @xmath135 where we have used eq . to replace coordinate distances with proper length . in terms of this proper time , eq . is given by @xmath136 the functional form of this equation is again the same as eq . , but now with corrections to both the dust - like and spatial curvature - like terms , as well as the radiation - like term .      up to this point",
    "we have treated the geometry within each cell as a perturbation to minkowski space .",
    "this is convenient , as it allows the apparatus constructed for the study of post - newtonian gravity in isolated systems to be applied with only minimal modifications . when considering the case of a cosmological model , however , it is also of use to be able to understand the form of the gravitational fields in the background of a robertson - walker geometry . in this section",
    "we will show that the perturbed minkowski space description and the perturbed robertson - walker description are isometric to each other , as long as we restrict our consideration to a single cell .",
    "we will present coordinate transformations that make this isometry explicit .",

    "and we then obtain @xmath173 where we have used eqs . and in the last line . for a flat flrw background",
    "we can use eq .",
    ", together with the solution for the scale factor , to find @xmath174 where @xmath175 has been taken to be positive .",
    "now , using eqs . and , for the solutions of @xmath116 and @xmath3 , respectively , we can infer that @xmath176 the proper length of a cell edge in the robertson - walker background is therefore given by @xmath177 the friedmann - like equation can then be written in terms of this quantity as @xmath178 this equation has the same form as eq . , but with a different numerical coefficient for the radiation - like term .",
    "again , we remind the reader that this term , although it takes the form of a radiation fluid in the evolution equation for the scale of the space , does not correspond to any actual matter field . it is purely a result of the non - linearity of einstein s equations .      the majority of this paper has been aimed at constructing a geometry to model the space - time of a universe that can accommodate large non - linear density contrasts on small scales , while maintaining a periodic structure that means it is invariant under a certain set of discrete spatial translations on large scales .",
    "space - time geometry itself , however , is not a direct observable .",
    "we will therefore pause , and consider in this section the consequences of this new type of model for cosmological observables .",
    "we will briefly consider two types of observations : ( i ) those based on the motion of time - like particles ( i.e. galaxies , dark matter , etc . ) , and ( ii ) those based on observations made along null geodesics .",
    "of course , almost all observations are in fact made by observing light , but one can in principle split ones considerations into the effect of the expansion of space on the light directly , and the effect of the expansion on the astrophysical objects that emit or interact with the light .",
    "let us start with the motion of time - like particles .",
    "the model constructed above , and in particular the green s function formalism adopted in section [ sec6a ] , allows @xmath179-body simulations of structure formation to be modelled to post - newtonian accuracy in a fully self - consistent way .",
    "this problem has recently been studied using a different approach in @xcite , where actual simulations were performed , and observables extracted .",
    "the effects of post - newtonian gravitational fields are found to be small in all aspects of these simulations , but are nonetheless important for understanding the consequences of relativistic gravity , and in order to accurately interpret precision cosmological data .",
    "we expect our formalism to produce similar results , although the simplicity of our equations may bring some computational benefits .",
    "winding back the evolution of the universe to earlier times , the consequences of relativistic gravitational fields should be expected to become more significant .",
    "the corrections we found for the large - scale expansion of our particular solution , presented in section [ sec6b ] , were of the order of our cell size squared divided by the hubble radius squared .",
    "taking cells the size of the homogeneity scale , this gives corrections at the level of about @xmath180 part in @xmath181 .",
    "larger cells will give larger corrections . by coincidence , this is about the same size as the contribution of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation to the expansion of the universe at late - times .",
    "our corrections also scale like a radiation fluid , so naively extrapolating our results suggests that our corrections may start to become significant in the evolution of the universe at about the same time as radiation starts to become important . for high precision observables , such as the cmb ,",
    "it is conceivable that this could have some impact on the interpretation of data .",
    "let us now consider observations based on the evolution of null congruences in the space - time .",
    "the method of propagating null geodesics through a lattice universe of this type has already been considered in @xcite .",
    "the method suggested there was to decompose the tangent vector to these curves as @xmath182 where @xmath32 and @xmath183 are an orthogonal pair of time - like and space - like unit vectors .",
    "when a null geodesic reaches a cell boundary one can then read off @xmath184 and @xmath183 , which can be transformed to similar quantities in the new cell using the coordinate transformations from eqs . and .",
    "these quantities can then be used as initial conditions for extending the same null geodesic through the new cell .",
    "depending on the coordinate system being used , the cosmological redshift in these models comes primarily either from the expansion of space or the motion of the cell boundaries ( for the time - dependent and time - independent backgrounds , respectively ) . as the leading order part of the expansion of each of our cells is given by a friedmann - like equation with a dust - like content",
    ", we expect this to contribute the usual leading - order term to the redshifts calculated over large distances .",
    "what our framework adds beyond the usual treatment , however , is a consistent way to calculate the consequences of both newtonian and post - newtonian gravitational potentials on all scales up to the size of the cells being considered ( larger scales can always be included using standard cosmological perturbation theory ) .",
    "the effect of relativistic gravity on galaxy redshifts has recently attracted much attention , in the light of upcoming surveys @xcite .",
    "finally , the effect of inhomogeneity on the brightness and shear of a source can be calculated using the sachs optical equations @xcite : @xmath185 where @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 are the expansion , shear , and vorticity scalars of the rays of light that are being modelled .",
    "the affine distance along these rays is denoted @xmath189 , and @xmath23 and @xmath190 are the ricci and weyl tensors that describe the curvature of the space - time .",
    "the complex vectors @xmath191 are a set of mutually orthogonal and normalised vectors on the screen space orthogonal to @xmath192 , and the angular diameter distance can be calculated by integrating the expansion scalar , such that @xmath193 .",
    "one can immediately notice that , when light propagates in the near - vacuum regions between galaxies , the driving term in the evolution equation for @xmath186 is absent , while the driving term in the corresponding equation for @xmath187 is non - zero .",
    "this is exactly the opposite of what happens in homogeneous and isotropic space - times @xcite .",
    "our model provides a way in which this switching on and off of terms can be consistently modelled to post - newtonian order in an expanding universe .",
    "such quantities are of vital importance not only for constructing hubble diagrams , but also for correctly interpreting data from galaxy surveys and the cmb .",
    "it is therefore important that the models used to interpret these observations are as robust as possible .",
    "we have constructed cosmological models by patching together many sub - horizon - sized regions of space , each of which is described using post - newtonian physics .",
    "the boundaries between each of these regions was assumed to be reflection symmetric , in order to make the problem tractable .",
    "this allowed us to find the general form for the equation of motion of the boundary , as well as the general form of the post - newtonian gravitational fields that arise for general matter content .",
    "these results both follow from a straightforward application of the junction conditions , which in the latter case provides the appropriate boundary conditions for solving einstein s field equations .    as an example of how to apply this formalism , we considered the case of a large number of isolated masses , each of which is positioned at the centre of a cubic cell .",
    "we found that the large - scale evolution that emerges from such a configuration is well modelled by an equation that looks very much like the friedmann equation of general relativity , with pressureless dust and radiation as sources .",
    "the radiation term is necessarily much smaller than the dust term ( if the post - newtonian expansion is to be valid ) , and appears in the friedmann - like equation as if it had a negative energy density .",
    "this happens without any violation of the energy conditions , as the term in question arises from the non - linearity of einstein s equations , and does not directly correspond to any matter content .",
    "while small , the radiation - like term appears as the first relativistic correction to the large - scale expansion of the universe , when the matter content is arranged in the way described above .",
    "this term provides a small negative contribution to the rate of expansion , and a small positive contribution to the rate of acceleration .",
    "the existence of a radiation - like term has been found previously using exact results derived for the evolution of reflection symmetric boundaries @xcite , and using the shortwave approximation for fluctuations around a background metric @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen what form the first relativistic correction will take for more general configurations of matter fields , or for structures built with less restrictive symmetries .",
    "the former of these cases can be studied using the approach we have prescribed in section [ sec6a ] , while the latter requires a generalisation of our formalism .",
    "we are grateful to k. malik and s. rsnen for helpful comments .",
    "vaas and tc both acknowledge support from the stfc .",
    "the geodesic equation , in terms of proper time along a curve , is given by @xmath194 where @xmath195 are the christoffel symbols .",
    "let us now consider the motion of a boundary at @xmath196 .",
    "the proper time derivatives of this boundary are given by @xmath197 and @xmath198 eq . then allows us to write the @xmath121 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 components of the geodesic equation in terms of partial derivatives as @xmath199 using these equations , eq .",
