    "processes of central exclusive production have gained a lot of interest in the recent years . although the attention is paid mainly to high-@xmath4 processes that can be used for new physics searches ( exclusive higgs , @xmath5 interactions , _ etc . _ ) , measurements of low-@xmath4 signals are also very important as they can help to constrain models and to understand the backgrounds for the former ones .",
    "the aim of this paper is to discuss a measurement possibility of the exclusive @xmath0 production at the lhc , in which both protons are detected .",
    "this reaction is a natural background for exclusive production of resonances decaying into the @xmath0 channel , such as : @xmath6 , glueballs , glueball candidates ( _ e.g. _ @xmath7 ) or charmonia ( _ e.g. _ @xmath8 ) .",
    "since the cross section for the @xmath9 process is fairly large @xcite and estimation is important for the exotic meson production .",

    "the cross section is obtained by integration over the four - body phase space , which was reduced to 8 dimensions and performed numerically .",
    "a weighted monte carlo generator based on this model has been developed and was used in the following analysis .",
    "the final state of the @xmath9 consists of four particles  two protons and two pions . at the lhc",
    "the pions are produced in the rapidity range @xmath52 , whereas the protons are scattered at very small angles ( of the order of microradians ) into the accelerator beam pipe .",
    "therefore , to perform a fully exclusive measurement , there is a need of two different types of detectors ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ) : a central detector ( for pion detection ) and very forward detectors ( for proton tagging ) .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper assumes atlas as the central detector and alfa as the proton tagging detectors .        the atlas detector @xcite is located at the lhc interaction point 1 ( ip1 ) .",
    "it has been designed as a general purpose detector with a large acceptance in pseudorapidity , full azimuthal angle coverage , good charged particle momentum resolution and a good electromagnetic calorimetry completed by full - coverage hadronic calorimetry .",
    "the atlas tracking detector provides measurement of charged particles momenta in the @xmath53 region and the calorimeter covers @xmath54 .",
    "the alfa ( absolute luminosity for atlas ) detectors @xcite are designed for proton - proton elastic scattering measurement in the coulomb - nuclear amplitude interference region .",
    "these detectors are placed about 240  m from the ip1 , symmetrically on both sides , inside roman pots .",
    "these are special devices that allow to place detectors inside the beam pipe and to control the distance between their edge and the proton beam .",
    "this is of primordial importance for the detectors safety , since the proton beam can cause serious radiation damage .",
    "measurement of protons scattered at very small angles ( like in the elastic scattering ) requires a special tune of the lhc accelerator with very small angular dispersion at the ip .",
    "this is granted by a high value of the betatron function ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "due to limited radiation hardness , the alfa detector will be used only during the dedicated runs .",
    "it is worth mentioning that at the lhc , apart from alfa , there are also similar stations of the totem @xcite experiment placed around the cms central detector . although , the present study was carried out for alfa and atlas , similar results can be expected for totem and cms . in addition , two other proton tagging detectors are presently at the planning stage  afp ( atlas forward proton ) for atlas and hps ( high precision spectrometer ) for cms .",
    "their purpose is to tag forward protons during high luminosity lhc runs and to look at high-@xmath4 signals",
    ". the acceptance of these detectors will be completely different than the one of alfa and totem .",
    "actually , the afp and hps detectors will be able to detect protons which lost some part of their initial energy @xcite and will not register protons originating from elastic scattering .",
    "since for the @xmath9 process the energy loss of the protons is rather small , only the tails of this signal could be seen in afp or hps .",
    "taking into account the fact that these detectors will work during normal lhc runs , when there will be many independent interactions in one bunch crossing , it is clear that exclusive pion pair production can be measured only with help of alfa or totem .",
    "a crucial element of the @xmath56 measurement is the tagging of the forward protons with the alfa detectors .",
    "thus , a very important ingredient of this analysis is a proper simulation of the proton transport from the interaction point to the alfa stations through the lhc magnetic lattice .",
    "one needs to remember that the alfa detectors are designed only for the special lhc runs so a corresponding description of the lhc magnets has to be used in the simulation . in this paper the @xmath57  tev and @xmath58  m lhc optics was taken , since this is the configuration planned for the alfa runs in 2011 @xcite .",
    "the cross section for exclusive @xmath0 production at @xmath2  tev is 234  @xmath1b ( see sec .",
    "the requirement that both protons are tagged in the alfa stations causes that not all events can be fully registered .",
    "this is due to limited acceptance of the detectors .",
    "in fact , the visible cross section depends on the distance between the alfa detector edge and the beam centre ( it will be changed during runs , accordingly to beam conditions ) .",
    "this dependence is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : alfa_effect ]  ( left ) . for the rest of the present analysis",

    "[ fig : eta_dist ]  ( left ) , whereas the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_dist ] shows a correlation between pseudorapidities of both pions .",
    "the model used for the simulation predicts a strong correlation between the pseudorapidities of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which is not expected for pions originating from @xmath61 or @xmath62 processes .",
    "although the majority of the events contains pions with @xmath63 too large to be detected in atlas , the remaining cross section is still large enough to make the measurement possible .",
    "the pions can be detected in the atlas tracking detector ( @xmath64 ) or in the atlas calorimetry system ( @xmath54 ) . from the experimental point of view these are two different measurements , as the tracker enables the particle momentum and charge determination , whereas the calorimeter is sensitive only to the particle energy .",
    "one should note that the preferable measurement is the one with the tracker , as it provides very high precision and allows to efficiently discriminate against the like - charge background pairs .",
    "since the correlation between the pseudorapidities of both pions is very large , the following analysis is performed independently for the tracking detector ( @xmath64 ) and the forward calorimetry ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the two adequate distributions : pion transverse momentum in the central region ( @xmath64 ) and pion energy in the forward region ( @xmath65 ) are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : pt ] ( left ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : e ] ( left ) .",
    "requirement of both protons being tagged in the alfa detectors influences the shapes of the distributions only very little , but it reduces both by a factor close to three .    obviously , the number of events that can be observed depends on the minimal pion transverse momentum and minimal pion energy that are experimentally accessible .",

    "it should be mentioned that in the minimum bias analysis the efficiency for such low-@xmath4 tracks was quite small ( about 10% ) . however , in that analysis , the reconstruction algorithms had to simultaneously deal with many particle tracks .",
    "for very clean events that are considered in this work ( only two tracks ) it should be possible to adjust the reconstruction to obtain a much better efficiency .     as a function of @xmath4 treshold .",
