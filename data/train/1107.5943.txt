    "supersymmetry ( susy ) was introduced more than 30 years ago , in independent theoretical papers by golfand and likhtman  @xcite , volkov and akulov  @xcite , and wess and zumino  @xcite . in the first of these articles",
    "@xcite , the authors found the superextension of the poincar algebra and constructed the first four - dimensional field theory with supersymmetry , the ( massive ) supersymmetric quantum eletrodynamics ( sqed ) .",
    "the particle content of sqed is given by the electron ( fermion ) , positron ( antifermion ) , which are dirac fermions @xcite , the photon , and the spin-@xmath2 partners of the electron and the positron , the so - called selectron and spositron ( sfermions ) .",
    "also included in the model is the photino , the spin-@xmath3 superpartner of the photon .",
    "the photon and the photino are introduced in the same vector superfield , therefore the photino must be a majorana fermion @xcite . in this theory both the @xmath4-parity and the chirality are conserved and sparticles appear in pairs at any vertex , see @xcite .",
    "the history of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , which was constructed in 1975 @xcite , can be found in ref .  .",
    "in the early days of the model , the photino , which is denoted by the symbol @xmath5 , was called thephoton - neutrino \" and envisioned as a fundamental particle , expected to be stable @xcite and , at least at the classical level , massless @xcite .    within the context of supersymmetric field theories , two - component weyl - van der waerden fermions  @xcite enter naturally , due to the spinorial nature of the symmetry generators themselves and the holomorphic structure of the superpotential . using the two - component spinors we can introduce the helicity formalism , in which the individual amplitudes are computed analytically in terms of lorentz scalar invariants , i.  e. , of complex numbers that can readily be computed .",
    "it is then a simple numerical task to sum all the contributing amplitudes and compute the square of the complex magnitude of the resulting sum @xcite .    as a simple example , consider bhabha scattering @xmath6 @xcite in qed .",
    "we denote the initial - state momenta and helicities of the electron and positron ( @xmath7 ) and ( @xmath8 ) , respectively , and the final - state momenta and helicities of the electron and positron ( @xmath9 ) and ( @xmath10 ) , respectively . in the formalism of four - component dirac spinors ,",
    "the amplitude for the @xmath11 channel is given by the equality @xmath12    for the same process , in the two - spinor formalism the amplitude is given by the expression @xcite : @xmath13 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a more extensive discussion of this formalism and other useful examples , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "parity - conserving theories such as qed and qcd are well - suited to the four - component fermion methods .",
    "the latter being more broadly known than the two - component methods , our discussion will be based on majorana-(dirac ) four - component spinors .",
    "early in its history , the gluino , which is denoted @xmath14 , was called the  photonic neutrino \" and viewed as a massless particle , since it was difficult to generate a sizeable mass for it . the role and interactions of this fermion partner of the gluon , which like the photino is a majorana fermion ,",
    "are directly related to the properties of the supersymmetric qcd ( sqcd ) @xcite . in the early days , the existence of relatively light  @xmath4-hadrons \"  @xcite was therefore expected .",
    "today we know that a direct gaugino mass , symbolized @xmath15 , comes from supergravity @xcite , or from radiative corrections using messenger quarks .",
    "both mechanisms yield sufficiently high masses for the gluino .",
    "the phenomenological studies of the photinos started in 1979 , when fayet @xcite studied the interaction between photinos and matter for massless photinos and obtained the following cross section : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the mass of the slepton .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for the early notation .",
    "later , in 1982 , fayet @xcite studied the photino production from @xmath18 , still in the case of massless photinos , with the following result : @xmath19 , \\label{fayetresult}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the angle between the photino and the incoming electron , and @xmath11 is the usual mandelstam variable .    a later computation considered a massive photino @xcite .",
    "the mass @xmath21 acquired phenomenological importance because it was related to the scale of supersymmetry breaking @xcite , to which , more recently , the mass of the gluino has also been related . with a massive photino ,",

    ", it was thought that these reactions might define a useful signature of susy and the experiments , important limits on the photino and selectron masses .",
    "two years later the reactions @xmath23 and @xmath26 were accurately analyzed , and the results showed that the latter process has larger cross section than the former ( see fig .  2 in ref .  ) , a finding applicable only to the `` lower '' selectron masses .",
    "it was also found that the processes with polarized and unpolarized beams place strong limits on the @xmath27 plane ( see fig .  4 in ref .  )",
    "a photino production in this channel was analyzed in detail in ref .  .",
    "low - mass weakly interacting particles ( photinos , neutrinos , axions , etc . ) are produced in hot astrophysical plasmas and can therefore transport energy out of stars .",
    "the possible astrophysical consequences of  light \" photinos and gluinos , for which the main photino production channel is the subprocess @xmath28 followed by a gluino decay @xmath29 , were discussed in refs .  .",
    "it has been generally assumed that for small gaugino masses the photino is an approximate eigenstate , an assumption that is not generally valid .",
    "the classic signature of such events is missing transverse momentum ( @xmath30 ) from the escaping photinos .",
    "the analysis of the ua1 collaboration gave special attention to this characteristic @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the data analyses of the large electron positron collider at the cern ( lep ) were unable to follow the same approach . for larger gaugino masses",
    ", it is unproductive to think in terms of the photino , zino and neutrals higgsinos ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) .",
    "instead , one must consider the mixture of these states giving four neutralinos @xmath33 , @xmath34 . in a similar way",
    "the mixing of the charged gauginos with the charged higgsinos gives two charginos @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "the dominant gluino decays then occur via @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xcite .    the rate of the two - body decay @xmath39 of the gluinos was first analysed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where this decay rate was found to vanish for @xmath40 .",
    "the partial width for the gluino radiative decay was recomputed ( for @xmath41 ) in refs .  .",
    "the most general result for the radiative decay width of the gluinos was obtained in ref .",
    "for the photino as the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp )  @xcite . only with very massive gluinos ( @xmath42 ) do the two - body decays into quark plus squark become kinematically acessible and rapidly dominate the branching fraction @xcite .    notwithstanding the appealing arguments favoring susy , no supersymmetric particle has been found so far , in the first lhc runs of up to 8  tev cm energies @xcite . with the increasing luminosity and energies up to 14 tev in the next years , however , the prospect for discoveries is still good .",
    "the search is aided by the `` snowmass points and slopes '' ( sps ) @xcite , a set of benchmark points and parameter lines in the mssm parameter space corresponding to different scenarios in the quest for supersymmetry ( see ref .   for an instructive review ) .",
    "the goal here is to reconstruct the fundamental supersymmetric theory , and its breaking mechanism , from the experimental data @xcite .",
    "therefore , in various scenarios , given the sps convention , the neutralinos ( photinos ) are the lighter particles , while the gluino is the most massive particle of the mssm .",
