    "one of the most interesting questions in young stellar object ( yso ) research is how their jets , e.g.  @xcite , @xcite or @xcite , are collimated and accelerated . to address this problem",
    "one must obtain not only high spatial resolution but in addition kinematic information as close as possible to their source .",
    "ground - based long - slit spectroscopic studies of optically visible jet sources have shown that the structure and kinematics of the outflow region on scales @xmath51@xmath0 is rather complex ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . in a significant fraction of classical t  tauri stars ( cttss )",
    "the forbidden emission lines ( fels ) show two ( or more ) blueshifted velocity components which have very different properties ( note that in many cttss the corresponding redshifted part of the flow is occulted by a circumstellar disk , at least close to the source ) . in the case of double - peaked fel profiles ,",
    "the emission consists of a so - called high - velocity component ( hvc ) , having typical radial velocities of -60 to -200 kms@xmath6 and a low - velocity component ( lvc ) , having typical radial velocities of -5 to -20 kms@xmath6 with respect to the systemic velocity of the star ( see @xcite and @xcite for comprehensive discussions ) .",
    "while the hvc can be spatially very extended ( at least in the outflow direction ) and is often identified with a jet , the lvc is much more compact ( @xmath51@xmath0 ) .",
    "other differences between the two components have also been noted , for example the lvc appears to be of higher density but lower excitation than the hvc @xcite and the lvc shows a clear inverse correlation of velocity with increasing critical density .",
    "the latter effect has been interpreted as evidence of acceleration in the lvc with increasing distance from the star .",
    "a number of theories have been put forward to explain the origin of the various fel components .",
    "for example kwan and tademaru ( 1988 , 1995 ) have suggested that the lvc and hvc are separate flows . according to their model",
    "the lvc is a poorly collimated wind coming from the outer periphery of the yso disk while the hvc is a separate jet launched from closer to the star .",
    "others have sought to explain the observations in terms of a one component , non - isotropic , wind model in which the appearence of separate fel components is due to projection effects @xcite . in any event , @xcite has shown that the luminosity of the two components is tightly correlated , which seems to imply that they are not independent flows , and that the apparent dominance of one component over the other may be a density effect .    in order to examine in more detail the nature of the compact fel region , we have observed the ctts dg  tau with stis on - board the hst .",
    "multiple overlapping slit positions parallel to the outflow from this star were chosen so as to build up a 3-d spatial intensity - velocity `` cube '' .",
    "our target was picked not only because it is one of the closest cttss , but more significantly because its fel region has a broad range of velocities , probably also a result of the relatively small angle between the jet axis and the line of sight ( @xmath7 , see @xcite ) .",
    "this is important given the moderate wavelength resolution of stis .",
    "historically , dg  tau was amongst the first t  tauri stars from which a jet - like outflow ( hh  158 ) was discovered @xcite and it has been imaged by the hst prior to the installation of the telescope s correcting optics @xcite . on large scales ( @xmath8  10@xmath0 ) the jet seems to terminate in a bow shock @xcite while high resolution spectro - imaging ground - based studies @xcite have shown that the flow close to the star contains at least two resolved knots ( at 2.7@xmath0 and 4@xmath0 , epoch 1994.8 ) .",
    "the outermost of these has a morphology and velocity gradient which is also consistent with it being a bow shock .    in  2",
    "we describe our observational technique and give details of our stis data .",
    "our primary results are described in  3 and discussed in  4 .",
    "a more detailed analysis will be presented in @xcite .",
    "stis spectra of dg  tau were taken on january 14 1999 using the g750 m grating and a central wavelength setting of 6581 . the spectral range of 562  included several strong forbidden lines ( [ oi]@xmath96300,6363 , [ nii]@xmath96548,6583 , [ sii]@xmath96716,6731 ) as well as h@xmath1 .",
    "the stis / ccd detector , a 1024@xmath101024 pixel array , had a spectral resolution of 0.56pixel@xmath6 and a nominal sampling of 0.05@xmath0pixel@xmath3 in the dispersion and spatial directions respectively .",
    "the actual spatial resolution , however , was limited by the psf of the hst in the red to a fwhm of approximately 0.1@xmath0 .",
    "the slit aperture was 52@xmath100.1 arcsec@xmath11 .",
    "seven different long - slit spectra were taken , keeping the slit parallel to the outflow axis ( p.a .",
    "226@xmath12 ) , but with steps of 0.07@xmath0 in the transverse direction , i.e.  with offsets southeast and northwest of the jet axis . in this way we built - up a 3-d flux density / radial velocity data cube of the optical outflow from dg  tau , with a total spatial width of about 0.5@xmath0 in the direction perpendicular to the jet axis .",
    "the spectra are labelled s1,s2, ... s7 going from the southeast to the north - west ; the central slit position ( s4 ) coincided with the star ( ra  4@xmath13  27@xmath14  04@xmath15.71 , dec + 26@xmath12 6@xmath16 16.8@xmath0 . )",
    "exposure times were split in order to facilitate removal of cosmic rays .",
    "total exposure times were approximately 2740s for s1  ",
    "s5 , 1930s for s6 and 2050s for s7 .",
    "note that the somewhat shorter exposure times for the last two spectra were due to minor problems with the hst .",
    "the pipeline spectra were found to be contaminated by a large number of `` hot '' pixels and so the raw data were first fully re - calibrated using the _ calstis _ suite of programs and new reference files made available by the stsci .",
    "subsequent reduction and data analysis was carried out using standard iraf routines . in order to minimise contrast problems close to the source , the stellar continuum , and that of a faint reflection nebula extending up to 2@xmath0 from the source , were carefully subtracted from all images .",
    "this operation proved to be particularly critical for the central spectra s3 , s4 , and s5 , due to the appearance of artificial undulations in the stellar continuum , caused by sampling effects ( see the stis handbook v3.0 ) .    from the acquired spectra we created synthetic 2-d images for the various lines in four broad distinct radial velocity intervals ( figs .",
    "these images were constructed by adjoining the seven row - averaged columns of pixels obtained from s1s7 for the corresponding velocity bin .",
    "averaging was done over five columns , corresponding to approximately  2.83 , in the dispersion direction . in order to study the lowest velocity emission in finer detail , we also ( fig .",
    "3 ) carried out a similar procedure in [ oi]@xmath176300 and [ sii]@xmath176731 but this time using just one column in the dispersion direction .",
    "all velocities quoted in this _",
    "letter _ are systemic using v@xmath18 + 16.5kms@xmath6 , as derived from the li@xmath176707 photospheric absorption line .",
    "our composite images of the outflow close to dg  tau in the four broad velocity bins , and in each of four lines ( h@xmath1 , [ nii]@xmath176583 , [ sii]@xmath176731 , and [ oi]@xmath176363 ) , are shown in figs .  1 and 2 .",
    "note that we did not include [ oi]@xmath176300 in these figures as the blueward portion of this line was missing from our spectra due to a restricted choice for the stis central wavelength .",
    "the velocity range is approximately + 50kms@xmath3 to -450kms@xmath3 and the four velocity bins ( low , medium , high , and very high ) , with widths of about 125kms@xmath3 , represent increasingly blueshifted velocities . on all figures",
    "the position of the star ( i.e.  the peak in the continuum subtracted light ) is marked .",
    "similar images , for the [ oi]@xmath176300 and [ sii]@xmath176731 lines , but only for the lowest velocities ( from about + 60kms@xmath3 to -70kms@xmath3 ) and with bin widths of only about 25kms@xmath3 , are shown in fig .",
    "first of all , we note that the appearence of the outflow changes , remarkably in some cases , from line to line and from velocity bin to velocity bin ( see in particular figs .  1 and 2 ) .",
    "the jet from dg  tau is , as one might expect , most evident at the highest velocities and is visible as a narrow feature up to about 0.7@xmath0 from the star",
    ". we will discuss it in more depth shortly . aside from the jet a limb - brightened bubble - like structure can also be observed that extends between 0.4@xmath0 and 1.5@xmath0 from dg  tau .",
    "the `` bubble '' , which is most evident at intermediate velocities , in combination with the jet , gives an overall pear - shaped morphology to the emission .",
    "comparison of figs .  1 , 2 and 3 lead to a number of important results : + ( i ) the lowest velocity emission close to the star ( @xmath50.3@xmath0 ) is spatially broad , i.e.  it is well resolved in the transverse direction to the outflow , but it does not extend far along the flow .",
    "+ ( ii ) within @xmath50.5@xmath0 from the star , there appears to be a more or less gradual increase in the degree of collimation with velocity : at high and very high velocities , the flow is primarily confined to the central axis .",
    "+ ( iii ) beyond 0.5@xmath0 from the star there are at least two well - defined structures ( which we have labelled a1 and a2 in the medium velocity h@xmath1 image following the knot nomenclature of @xcite ) .",
    "the outermost one , a1 , is bow - shaped and observed in all lines but the innermost one , a2 , is more easily seen in h@xmath1 .",
    "there is very high velocity gas immediately behind a1 , which is seen in all lines but which is not symmetrically distributed around the jet axis .",
    "the opposite effect is , incidentally , seen near a2 where the higher velocity gas appears in the _ downstream _ direction . the emission from a2",
    "is also distributed asymmetrically with respect to the outflow axis .",
    "+ ( iv ) comparison of the [ oi ] , [ sii ] , and [ nii ] data ( in figs .",
    "1 and 2 ) show that the central jet can be traced much closer to the source in [ oi ] and [ nii ] than in [ sii ] .",
    "this result is probably due to a combination of quenching and excitation effects ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "note that the [ oi ] line has a 100 ( 10 ) times higher critical density than the [ sii ] ( [ nii ] ) line , and that the [ nii ] line usually traces gas of higher excitation .",
    "the emission peak ( centroid ) in the [ sii ] and [ oi ] images moves outwards with increasing velocity .",
    "this effect is visible at all velocities , but it is most obvious at the highest velocities where virtually no [ sii ] emission and only faint [ oi ] emission is seen in the region @xmath51@xmath0 . since the high velocity jet can be traced right back to the source in h@xmath1 , the lack of high - velocity and the presence of low - velocity fel emission at @xmath19 1@xmath0 can probably only be explained by quenching effects in _ both _ the longitudinal and lateral directions . in other words",
    "our data suggest that the jet density increases not only with proximity to the star ( in the longitudinal direction ) but also transversely toward the outflow axis . without the latter effect one would not be able to explain why",
    "there is so much spatially extended and easily quenchable _ low - velocity _ fel emission seen so close to the source .",
    "+ ( v ) quenching effects likewise manifest themselves at low velocities ( see fig .",
    "3 ) in that the centroid of the low velocity [ oi]@xmath176300 emission is closer to the star than the centroid of the [ sii]@xmath176731 emission .",
    "this was expected on the basis of groundbased measurements @xcite .",
    "+ ( vi ) in the region close to the star ( @xmath50.7@xmath0 ) [ nii ] emission comes primarily from the high velocity jet implying this is the region with the highest excitation .",
    "+ ( vii ) the medium velocity bow - shaped structure a1 is less evident in [ sii ] and [ oi ] than in h@xmath1 , suggesting that its excitation level may be high .",
    "+ ( viii ) there is a strong low velocity peak in h@xmath1 emission coinciding with the star .",
    "this is almost certainly scattered emission from a region close to dg  tau , including possibly a magnetospheric contribution @xcite and therefore does not constitute part of the outflow _ per se_.",
    "the stis observations presented here clearly show that the hvc emission in dg  tau comes from the most highly focused part of the outflow i.e.  the jet .",
    "the jet at high velocities can be traced back to at least 0.1@xmath0 ( 15au ) from the star where quenching effects become important even in the case of the [ oi]@xmath96300,6363 lines , which have the highest critical density ( @xmath20 @xmath21 ) among the studied fels .",
    "obviously it is likely that the jet is collimated on even smaller scales .",
    "the shifts of the emission centroids in the different lines and in the different velocity bins can be explained quite naturally if there is an increase in jet density not only with proximity to the star ( in the longitudinal direction ) but also to the central outflow axis .",
    "that is to say the high velocity `` core '' of the jet is denser than its periphery .",
    "this is confirmed by an inspection of the [ sii]@xmath96716,6731 doublet ratio ( see fig .  2 and bacciotti et al .",
    "note also that structures such as a1 and a2 are reminiscent of the `` bubbles '' recently seen by @xcite in the case of xz  tauri .",
    "these are almost certainly internal working surfaces caused by temporal variations in the outflow from dg  tau .",
    "certainly there is plenty of evidence for strong jet velocity variations in dg  tau ( and in many other ctts stars ) on timescales of years .",
    "for example , the data of @xcite and @xcite show an increase in the radial velocity of the jet at d @xmath4 0.5@xmath0 by a factor of 2 within 8 years .",
    "also the proper motion data of @xcite indicate large velocity variations .",
    "finally , several of the knots in the dg  tau jet show bow shock - like structures ( see also the hst archive data presented in @xcite ) and these provide indirect evidence for strong velocity variations . + turning now to the lvc , its nature still remains somewhat enigmatic .",
    "it was already clear from groundbased observations that the lvc and hvc differ in many properties such as density and excitation .",
    "a new difference is reported here i.e.  the rather large spatial width w of the lvc perpendicular to the jet at distances d of about 0.1@xmath00.3@xmath0 from the source .",
    "a comparison of w ( at fwhm ) between the high and low - velocity emission in [ sii ] and [ oi ] shows that the average w(lvc ) @xmath4 0.18@xmath0 while the hvc is hardly resolved at a distance d of 0.2@xmath0 .",
    "we note that this comparison of spatial widths can only be done using our [ sii ] and [ oi ] `` images '' as the h@xmath1 data is heavily contaminated by stellar h@xmath1 emission and in [ nii ] the lvc is very weak .",
    "another interesting result of our study is the smaller velocity of the lvc at the edges of the flow ( for full details see @xcite ) .",
    "for example at d=0.2@xmath0 the lvc peaks at @xmath4 -95kms@xmath3 in [ oi ] for the central slit position ( s4 ) while in the two outermost slit positions ( s1,s7 ) it peaks at about -18kms@xmath3 .",
    "the corresponding values for the [ sii ] line are -60kms@xmath3 and -40kms@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "since these lines are optically thin , such observations clearly point to a rise in the average lvc velocity as the central outflow axis is approached .",
    "+ to what degree the observations of dg  tau presented here , particularly of the lvc , are representative of other cttss is an open question .",
    "dg  tau is one of the most active cttss known and we caution that the lvc of dg  tau is unusual in that it has the highest absolute velocity of all the cttss listed by @xcite , as well as one of the highest accretion rates .",
    "that said it shares the typical properties of other lvcs and , in particular , the ratio of its luminosity ( l ) to that of the dg  tau hvc is in perfect agreement with the l(hvc ) v.  l(lvc ) relationship noted by @xcite .",
    "thus dg  tau may simply be displaying the higher activity tail of the distribution of outflow properties amongst cttss . in conclusion",
    "our stis observations show , for the first time , a quasi - continuous variation in the outflow velocity close to a yso in the transverse direction to the flow .",
    "detailed studies are required , however , to test whether these observations can constrain models for the generation of the lvc and hvc .",
