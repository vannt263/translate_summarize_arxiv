    "they represent the most important source of information on short - distance physics . with increasing energy , multiparticle events are becoming more and more dominant .",
    "thus , in testing various aspects of qcd , the high - energy scattering processes , both exclusive and inclusive , in which the total number of particles ( partons ) in the initial and final states is @xmath5 , have recently become increasingly important .",
    "owing to the well - known fact that the lo predictions in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) do not have much predictive power , the inclusion of higher - order corrections is essential for many reasons . in general , higher - order corrections have a stabilizing effect , reducing the dependence of the lo predictions on the renormalization and factorization scales and the renormalization scheme .",
    "therefore , to achieve a complete confrontation between theoretical predictions and experimental data , it is very important to know the size of radiative corrections to the lo predictions .",
    "obtaining radiative corrections requires the evaluation of one - loop integrals arising from the feynman diagram approach . with the increasing complexity of the process under consideration ,",
    "the calculation of radiative corrections becomes more and more tedious .",
    "therefore , it is extremely useful to have an algorithmic procedure for these calculations , which is computerizable and leads to results which can be easily and safely evaluated numerically .",
    "the case of feynman integrals with massless internal lines is of special interest , because one often deals with either really massless particles ( gluons ) or particles whose masses can be neglected in high@xmath0energy processes ( quarks ) .",
    "owing to the fact that these integrals contain ir divergences ( both soft and collinear ) , they need to be evaluated in an arbitrary number of space - time dimensions . as it is well known , in calculating feynman diagrams mainly three difficulties",

    "considerable progress has recently been made in developing efficient approaches for calculating one@xmath0loop feynman integrals with a large number ( @xmath5 ) of external lines @xcite .",
    "various approaches have been proposed for reducing the dimensionally regulated ( @xmath5)@xmath0point tensor integrals to a linear combination of @xmath1 and lower@xmath0point scalar integrals multiplied by tensor structures made from the metric tensor @xmath6 and external momenta @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that the general @xmath7point scalar one@xmath0loop integral can recursively be represented as a linear combination of @xmath8@xmath0point integrals provided the external momenta are kept in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "consequently , all scalar integrals occurring in the computation of an arbitrary one@xmath0loop @xmath9@xmath0point integral can be reduced to a sum over a set of basic scalar box @xmath10 integrals with rational coefficients depending on the external momenta and the dimensionality of space@xmath0time . despite , the considerable progress ,",

    "the integrals of this type arise when performing the leading - twist nlo analysis of hadronic exclusive processes at large@xmath0momentum transfer in pqcd .    with no restrictions regarding the external kinematics , in this paper",
    "we formulate an efficient , systematic and completely general method for reducing an arbitrary one@xmath0loop @xmath1point massless integral to a set of basic integrals .",
    "although the method is presented for massless case , the generalization on massive case is straightforward .",
    "the main difference between the massive and massless cases manifests itself in the basic set of integrals , which in former case is far more complex . among the one@xmath0loop faynman integrals there",
    "exist both massive and massless integrals for which the existing reduction methods break down .",

    "the quantity @xmath26(@xmath27 ) represents an infinitesimal imaginary part , it ensures causality and after the integration determines the correct sign of the imaginary part of the logarithms and dilogarithms .",

    "it is originally obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . based on ( [ f15 ] ) , any dimensionally regulated @xmath1point tensor integral can be expressed as a linear combination of @xmath1point scalar integrals multiplied by tensor structures made from the metric tensor @xmath6 and external momenta .",
    "therefore , with the decomposition ( [ f15 ] ) , the problem of calculating the tensor integrals has been reduced to the calculation of the general scalar integrals .",
    "it should be pointed out that among the tensor reduction methods presented in the literature one can find methods , e.g. @xcite which for @xmath5 completely avoid the terms proportional to the metric tensor @xmath6 .",
    "compared with the method expressed by ( [ f15 ] ) , these reduction procedures lead to decomposition containing a smaller number of terms . the methods of this type are based on the assumption that for @xmath5 , one can find four linearly independent 4-vectors forming a basis of the 4-dimensional minkowski space , in terms of which the metric tensor can then be expressed .",
    "this assumption is usually not realized when analyzing the exclusive processes at large - momentum - transfer ( hard scattering picture ) in pqcd .",
    "thus , for example , in order to obtain the next - to - leading order corrections to the hard - scattering amplitude for the proton - compton scattering , one has to evaluate one - loop @xmath50 diagrams .",
    "the set of external momenta contains two subsets comprised of three collinear momenta ( representing the proton ) .",
    "the kinematics of the process is thus limited to the 3-dimensional subspace .",
    "if this is the case , the best way of doing the tensor decomposition is the one based on formula ( [ f15 ] ) , regardless of the fact that for large @xmath12 the number of terms obtained can be very large .    as is well known , the direct evaluation of the general scalar integral ( [ f5 ] ) ( i.e. ( [ f13 ] ) ) represents a non - trivial problem .",
    "however , with the help of the recursion relations , the problem can be significantly simplified in the sense that the calculation of the original scalar integral can be reduced to the calculation of a certain number of simpler fundamental ( basic ) intgerals .",
    "recursion relations for scalar integrals have been known for some time @xcite . however , as it turns out , the existing set of relations that can be found in the literature is not sufficient to perform the reduction procedure completely , i.e. for all one - loop integrals appearing in practice .",
    "the problem is related to vanishing of various kinematic determinants , it is manifest for the cases corresponding to @xmath51 , and it is especially acute when evaluating one - loop feynman integrals appearing in the nlo analysis of large momentum transfer exclusive processes in pqcd . as is well known , these processes are generally described in terms of feynman diagrams containing a large number of external massless lines .",
    "thus , for example , for nucleon compton scattering is @xmath50 .",
    "a large number of external lines implies a large number of diagrams to be considered , as well as a very large number of terms generated when performing the tensor decomposition using ( [ f15 ] ) . in view of the above , to treat the feynman integrals ( diagrams ) with a large number of external lines",
    "the use of computers is unavoidable .",
    "this requires that the scalar reduction procedure be generally applicable .",
    "it is therefore absolutely clear that any ambiguity or uncertainty present in the scalar recursion relations constitutes a serious problem .",
    "the method presented below makes it possible to perform the reduction completely regardless of the kinematics of the process considered and the complexity of the structure of the contributing diagrams .",
    "for the reason of completeness and clearness of presentation and with the aim of comparison with the already existing results , we now briefly present a few main steps of the derivation of recursion relations .",
    "it should be pointed out that the derivation essentially represents a variation of the derivation originally given in @xcite .",
    "recursion relations for scalar integrals are obtained with the help of the integration - by - parts method @xcite .",
    "owing to translational invariance , the dimensionally regulated integrals satisfy the following identity : @xmath52 where @xmath53 are arbitary constants , while @xmath31 are the propagators given by ( [ f2 ] ) . the identity ( [ f16 ] )",

    "we have obtained the fundamental set of recursion relations by choosing the arbitrary constants @xmath59 so as to satisfy the following system of linear equations : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is an arbitrary constant . introducing the notation @xmath62 , the system ( [ f25 ] )",
    "may be written in matrix notation as @xmath63    it should be pointed out that the expression of the type ( [ f20 ] ) and the system of the type ( [ f27 ] ) , for the case of massive propagators ( @xmath64 ) , see ref .",
    "@xcite , can simply be obtained from the relation given above by making a change @xmath65 .",
    "consequently , considerations performed for the massive case @xcite apply to the massless case , and vice versa .",
    "it should be mentioned that , in the existing literature , the constant @xmath61 used to be chosen as a real number different from zero .",
    "however , it is precisely this fact that , at the end , leads to the breakdown of the existing scalar reduction methods .",
    "namely , for some kinematics ( e.g. collinear on - shell external lines ) the system ( [ f27 ] ) has no solution for @xmath66 .",
    "however , if the possibility @xmath67 is allowed , the system ( [ f27 ] ) will have a solution regardless of kinematics .",
    "this makes it possible to obtain additional reduction relations and formulate methods applicable to arbitrary number of external lines and to arbitrary kinematics .    if ( [ f25 ] ) is taken into account , and after using the relation @xcite @xmath68 which can be easily proved from the representation ( [ f13 ] ) , the relation ( [ f20 ] ) reduces to @xmath69 where @xmath59 are given by the solution of the system ( [ f25 ] ) , and the infinitesimal part proportional to @xmath26 has been omitted",
    "this is a generalized form of the recursion relation which connects the scalar integrals in a different number of dimensions @xcite .",
    "the use of the relation ( [ f31 ] ) in practical calculations depends on the form of the solution of the system of equations ( [ f25 ] ) . for general considerations , it is advantageous to write the system ( [ f25 ] ) in the following way : @xmath70 in writing ( [ f32 ] ) , we have taken into account the fact that @xmath55 . in this way ,",
    "the only free parameter is @xmath71 and by choosing it in a convenient way , one can always find the solution of the above system and , consequently , be able to use the recursion relations ( [ f31 ] ) .    in the literature , for example in ref .",
    "@xcite , the recursion relations are obtained by inserting the general solution of the system ( [ f25 ] ) , i.e. the system ( [ f32 ] ) , into the relation ( [ f31 ] ) .",
    "the recursion relations thus obtained are of limited practical use if the matrices of the mentioned systems are very singular .",
    "this happens when there are either two or more collinear external lines or , in general , for @xmath51 .",
    "when this is the case , the analysis of the general coefficient of the recursion becomes very complicated and in many cases unmanageable .",
    "there are cases when all coefficients vanish .",
    "as stated in @xcite , for @xmath72 , owing to the drastic reduction of the recurrence relations these cases need a separate investigation .",
    "in addition , the above - mentioned problems with @xmath73 appear . to avoid these problems , a different approach to recursion relations can be taken .",
    "it is based on the fact , that finding any solution of the systems of equations mentioned above , makes it possible to perform the reduction .",
    "being forced to use computers , it is very convenient and important that the reduction procedure be organized in a such a way that the recursion relations are classified and used depending on the form of the solutions of the above systems .",
    "if this is done , the increased singularity of the kinematic determinants turns out to be working in our favour by making it easy to find a solution of the systems of linear equations relevant to the reduction .    in the following we frequently refer to two determinants , for which we introduce the notations : for the determinant of the system ( [ f27 ] ) we introduce det@xmath74 , while for the determinant of the system ( [ f32 ] ) we use det@xmath75 . depending on whether the kinematic determinants det@xmath74 and det@xmath75 are equal to zero or not",
    ", we distinguish four different types of recursion relations following from ( [ f31 ] ) . before proceeding to consider various cases ,",
    "note that in the case when det@xmath76 , it holds @xmath77    it should be mentioned that for some of the recursion relations presented below one can find similar expressions in the literature .",
    "for reasons of clearness , connections of the relations given below with those existing in the literature are commented upon after the analysis of all possible cases has been considered .",
    "let us now discuss all possible cases separately .",
    "the most convenient choice in this case is @xmath80 .",
    "it follows from ( [ f33 ] ) that @xmath66 , so that the recursion relation ( [ f31 ] ) can be written in the following form : @xmath81 .\\label{f34}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as it is seen , this recursion relation connects the scalar integral in @xmath4 dimensions with the scalar integrals in @xmath82 dimensions and can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the scalar integral .    since det@xmath83",
    ", some more recursion relations can be directly derived from ( [ f20 ] ) . by directly choosing the constants @xmath59 in ( [ f20 ] ) in such a way that @xmath84",
    ", for @xmath85 , we arrive at a system of @xmath12 equations which is always valid : @xmath86 in the system ( [ f35 ] ) we have again disregarded the non - essential infinitesimal term proportional to @xmath26 .",
    "the matrix of the system ( [ f35 ] ) is the same as the matrix of the system ( [ f25 ] ) , whose determinant is different from zero , so that the system ( [ f35 ] ) can be solved with respect to @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "the solutions represent the recursion relations which can be used to reduce the powers of the propagators in the scalar integrals . making use of these relations and the relation ( [ f34 ] ) , each scalar integral @xmath89 belonging to the type for which det@xmath90 , det@xmath83 can be represented as a linear combination of integrals @xmath91 and integrals with the number of propagators which is less than @xmath12 . for the dimension @xmath92",

    "this possibility arises only if the first row of the matrix of the system ( [ f32 ] ) is a linear combination of the remaining rows .",
    "then , the system ( [ f32 ] ) has a solution only for the choice @xmath103 . with this choice",
    ", the remaining system of equations reduces to the system ( [ f25 ] ) , where the constant @xmath61 can be chosen at will .",
    "after the parameter @xmath61 is chosen , the constants @xmath59 are uniquely determined . thus the recursion relation ( [ f31 ] ) with the choice @xmath104 leads to @xmath105 consequently , as in the preceding case ,",
    "the scalar integrals of the type considered can be represented as a linear combination of scalar integrals with a smaller number of propagators .      unlike in the preceding cases , in this case two different recursion relations arise . to derive them ,",
    "we proceed by subtracting the last , @xmath106@xmath0th , equation of the system ( [ f32 ] ) from the second , third , ... and @xmath12@xmath0th equation , respectively . as a result",
    ", we arrive at the following system of equations : @xmath107 as it is seen , the first @xmath12 equations of the above system form a system of equations in which the constant @xmath61 does not appear , and which can be used to determine the constants @xmath59 , @xmath108 .",
    "the fact that det@xmath109 implies that the determinant of this system vanishes .",
    "therefore , for the system in question to be consistent ( for the solution to exist ) , the choice @xmath103 has to be made .",

    "<S> we present a systematic method for reducing an arbitrary one@xmath0loop @xmath1point massless feynman integral with generic 4@xmath0dimensional momenta to a set comprised of eight fundamental scalar integrals : six box integrals in @xmath2 , a triangle integral in @xmath3 , and a general two@xmath0point integral in @xmath4 space time dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> all the divergences present in the original integral are contained in the general two@xmath0point integral and associated coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of vanishing of the kinematic determinants has been solved in an elegant and transparent manner . </S>",
    "<S> being derived with no restrictions regarding the external momenta , the method is completely general and applicable for arbitrary kinematics . in particular , it applies to the integrals in which the set of external momenta contains subsets comprised of two or more collinear momenta , which are unavoidable when calculating one@xmath0loop contributions to the hard@xmath0scattering amplitude for exclusive hadronic processes at large momentum transfer in pqcd . </S>",
    "<S> the iterative structure makes it easy to implement the formalism in an algebraic computer program .    </S>",
