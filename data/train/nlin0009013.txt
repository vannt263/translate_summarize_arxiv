    "in the last years , there has been an increasing interest in modeling transport phenomena by low - dimensional , deterministic dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "multibaker maps @xcite appeared to be the simplest models of this approach .",
    "they provide an opportunity to derive the equations of non - equilibrium thermodynamics from an underlying dynamics _ without _ using the concept of particles .",
    "the strongly - chaotic mixing properties of these two - dimensional maps seem to be sufficient to ensure consistency with the entropy balance equation of thermodynamics provided that a properly chosen coarse - grained entropy and a macroscopic limit are taken @xcite .",
    "previous work successfully described the phenomena of diffusion @xcite , conduction in an external field @xcite , chemical reactions @xcite , thermal conduction @xcite , and cross effects due to the simultaneous presence of an external field and heat conduction @xcite by means of multibaker maps .",
    "not only stationary , but also transient states could be addressed @xcite . here",
    "we add to this list the phenomenon of shear flows and the accompanying viscous heating .",
    "the interest of this is to clarify how the shear rate enters the expression for the irreversible entropy production .",
    "after all , by the definition of local equilibrium the macroscopic flow profile does not appear in the entropy balance .",
    "thermodynamic averages contain only _ deviations _ from the average streaming velocity .",
    "we consider a viscous fluid driven by applying a shear forcing to two parallel walls of separation @xmath0 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fluid is assumed to be incompressible .",
    "the upper wall moves in the @xmath1-direction with a constant velocity @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry]a ) . we restrict ourselves to a discussion of ( possibly non - stationary ) laminar flow .",
    "due to translation invariance the velocity @xmath3 is always directed in the @xmath1 direction , and it only depends on the @xmath4 coordinate .",
    "similarly , the temperature @xmath5 is independent of the @xmath1 and @xmath6 coordinates .",
    "there is no external pressure gradient applied , and the internal pressure forces due to eventual temperature changes are expected to be negligible . for sufficiently long times the well - known linear velocity profile @xmath7 is approached as asymptotic steady state .",
    "the spatial behavior of the temperature distribution @xmath8 depends on the boundary conditions .",
    "initially @xmath5 is typically increasing in time due to the viscous heating .",
    "for an adiabatically closed fluid , the asymptotic distribution @xmath9 is spatially constant and grows linearly with time .",
    "inclusion of a heat sink can remove this time dependence such that the asymptotic state becomes stationary . in a hydrodynamic",
    "setting the sink acts only at the boundaries of the system , but an artificial , spatially - uniform sink can also be implemented .",
    "it mimics the so - called sllod @xcite algorithm of non - equilibrium molecular dynamics .",
    "we model an intersection of the fluid along the @xmath4 axis by a multibaker map .",
    "it consists of @xmath10 cells of size unity times @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry]a ) .",
    "the cells @xmath12 and @xmath13 represent the boundary , and cells @xmath14 , the bulk of the fluid , whose width is @xmath15 . in each cell",
    "there is a momentum - like variable @xmath16 defined besides the position .",
    "the multibaker dynamics advects two fields ; the microscopic velocity @xmath17 and the microscopic temperature @xmath18 .",
    "the appropriate ( below ) averages @xmath19 and @xmath20 over cell @xmath21 are called the coarse - grained fields . in the macroscopic limit",
    "they go over into the hydrodynamic velocity field and the thermodynamic temperature , respectively .",
    "the two - dimensional multibaker dynamics is defined as follows ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry]b ) . after each time unit @xmath22",
    "every cell @xmath23 is divided into three bands of heights @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath24 , such that @xmath26 .",
    "the outermost ones are mapped onto a column of height @xmath11 and width @xmath27 in cells @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the middle one stays in cell @xmath21 , where it is transformed into a column of width @xmath30 . in all cases the area",
    "is preserved such that an initially constant phase - space density @xmath31 remains constant in time , reflecting the incompressibility of the fluid .",
    "hence , the density can be identified with the density of the fluid .",
    "the velocity and the temperature fields are advected by the multibaker dynamics .",
    "in contrast to the density @xmath31 they typically evolve in time . starting with a coarse - grained velocity distribution @xmath19 along the chain ,",
    "the updated values @xmath32 after time @xmath22 become @xmath33 this update expresses momentum conservation in the @xmath4-direction .",
    "a portion @xmath34 of the original momentum ( velocity ) remains in cell @xmath21 , and portions @xmath27 of the momenta ( velocities ) of the neighboring cells flow in .",
    "the temperature equation follows from the energy balance .",
    "the full energy @xmath35 of cell @xmath21 after coarse graining is proportional to the sum of the temperature @xmath20 and the translational kinetic energy @xmath36 , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a constant .",
    "the update of energy is due to an in- and outflow of energy from the neighbors @xmath39 the action of a thermostat can , however , lead to a change of this kinetic energy .",

    "a repeated application of the chaotic , mixing multibaker dynamics leads to a fractal distribution of the temperature and the velocity fields .",
    "similar to the treatment of diffusive mass and heat transport @xcite the emergence and proliferation of these structures lies at the heart of a consistent dynamical - systems treatment of static and transient transport phenomena .",
    "the gibbs entropy of a multibaker system is defined as the information - theoretic entropy , as the phase - space average of @xmath47 .",
    "the reference density @xmath48 in the single - particle phase space of the multibaker map is expected to depend on the temperature .",
    "we take the choice @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a constant exponent .",
    "since the density @xmath31 is constant in space and time the gibbs energy of cell @xmath21 becomes and a constant additive constant are suppressed here ; @xcite for details . ]",
    "@xmath51 the coarse - grained entropy is defined in an analogous way as @xmath52 it is based on the cell - averaged , coarse - grained value of the temperature @xmath53 . as announced , the average ( streaming ) velocities @xmath19 do not enter the definition of the entropy .",
    "for the purpose of deriving the time evolution of entropies , it is useful to choose and initial condition with uniform densities in every cell .",
    "the coarse - grained and the gibbs entropy then initially coincide . after one time step , however , the gibbs entropy changes due to the fact that the @xmath5 field takes different values in the neighboring cells , viz . @xmath54         + ( 1 - 2 g ) \\ ; \\ln [ t_m \\ ; ( 1+\\tau q_m ) ]         + g \\ ;",

    ". its temporal change can be decomposed as @xmath56 and information - theoretic arguments @xcite lead one to identify    @xmath57    with the entropy flux and the rate of entropy production , respectively .",
    "note that the second term of the numerator of vanishes due to the choice of initial conditions .",

    "\\label{eq : dism}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it does not depend on the source term @xmath40 , but only on the values of the field @xmath5 in cell @xmath21 and its neighbors .",
    "entropy production arises in this model from ( i ) an explicit evolution of the macroscopic temperature profile , and ( ii ) from mixing of regions with different local temperatures .",
    "the emergence of self - similar structure in the temperature distribution @xmath53 can lead to a non - vanishing steady - state entropy production .",
    "note that on the level of this discrete relations the entropy production does not yet contain the velocity distribution @xmath19 .",
    "the effect of shear flow is only implicitly arising from the splitting of the full kinetic energy into a translational and an irregular part that depends on the implicit choice of a spatial resolution when writing . in the gibbs",
    "entropy the local velocity @xmath60 enters implicitly through the definition ( [ eq : em ] ) of the temperature , while for the coarse - grained entropy only the averages on the cells ( @xmath19 ) can enter .",
    "the entropy flux @xmath61 can be written as the sum of the discrete divergence of the entropy current    @xmath62    and the flux @xmath63    into the thermostat .",
    "establishing a discrete momentum , energy and entropy balance is not sufficient to motivate the thermodynamic relevance of a dynamical systems model transport .",
    "as argued in @xcite a full consistency can only be found in a continuum scaling limit ( the _ macroscopic limit _ ) where the time evolution equations have to coincide with the relations known from irreversible thermodynamics , irrespective of the detailed prescription of how to choose the discrete time and space units needed to define the local equilibrium .",
    "the macroscopic limit corresponds to @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath22 is much smaller than typical macroscopic time scales ( for instance the viscous relaxation time ) .",
    "formally it is defined as @xmath66 such that the spatial coordinate @xmath67 is finite . taking this limit",
    "will be indicated by the arrow @xmath68 .    in order to find the macroscopic limit @xmath69 of the coarse - grained velocity dynamics it is required that @xmath70 takes the finite value @xmath71 in the limit , @xmath72 for a vanishing pressure gradient eq .",
    "( [ eq : vn ] ) leads to the navier - stokes equation for the laminar shear flow @xcite , where @xmath71 is the _",
    "kinematic viscosity_.    considering the macroscopic limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tbal ] ) one obtains the temperature equation @xmath73 for @xmath74 this is exactly of the type known from hydrodynamics @xcite , where , however , the heat diffusion coefficient @xmath75 appears in front of the second derivative .",
    "hence , in the multibaker map @xmath71 also governs heat diffusion , @xmath76 . in the hydrodynamic expression , the coefficient of the term expressing viscous heating is @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the specific heat at constant volume .",
    "thus , we have to identify the constant @xmath38 with the specific heat , as also expected from a physical interpretation of .    evaluating the macroscopic limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : micbal ] ) one gets for the entropy density @xmath79 @xmath80 which coincides with the thermodynamic entropy balance @xcite if @xmath81 in the bulk . for the irreversible entropy production",
    "we find @xmath82 it is consistent with thermodynamics if @xmath83 corresponds to the heat conductivity @xmath84 of the flow .",
    "since in general @xmath85 , and since @xmath76 in our case , we conclude that also @xmath50 amounts to the specific heat in our model , @xmath86 .    for the entropy current @xmath87 one finds in the macroscopic limit @xmath88 also this relation fully agrees with its thermodynamic counterpart @xcite .",
    "the heat conductivity @xmath89 appears in front of the logarithmic derivative @xmath90 without possibility to adjust free parameters , thus demonstrating the full consistency of the results with irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "note that eqs .",
    " are valid at any instant of time .",
    "we have established a simple multibaker model that faithfully models hydrodynamic and thermal properties of shear flows .",
    "the model is based on an area - preserving multibaker dynamics .",
    "no phase - space contraction was needed .",
    "thermostating manifests itself in the appearance of the a source term @xmath91 that only influences the heat equation and the entropy flux . by a proper choice",
    "of @xmath92 one can stabilize any temperature profile @xmath93 as a steady state .",
    "for instance the choice @xmath94 eliminates viscous heating , and ensures a @xmath95constant steady state for a uniformly thermostated system .",
    "alternatively , a parabolic stationary temperature profile is obtained when the source terms only act at the boundaries in order to prescribe a constant temperature at the two ends . in either case",
    ", the source term @xmath96 leads to an entropy flux into a thermostat , and hence requires a generalization of the local relations of classical irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "the main interest of the model lies in the light it sheds on the origin of viscous heating in deterministic models of transport . as in the sllod algorithm it arises from the emergence of fractal structures .",
    "in contrast to that model where they are due to the joint action of a driving force and a gaussian thermostat introduced by heuristic arguments into the equations of motion , the present model also generates the structures for more typical physical settings of transport driven from the boundaries .",
    "it identifies the structures as arising from the mixing of regions with different _ local temperatures _ that is exponentially proliferating to smaller and smaller scales for a driven system . in the present model",
    "one can explicitly follow the analog of an energy cascade in turbulence where the kinetic energy of a macroscopic flow is distributed to finer and finer scales until reaching the kolmogorov scale where it has to be considered as contributing to the non - directional motion and leads to viscous heating .",
    "it is exactly this mechanism that also leads to the appearance of the macroscopic shear rate in the expression of the irreversible entropy production .",
