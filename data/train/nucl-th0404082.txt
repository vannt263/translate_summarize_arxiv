    "the latest version of the charge - dependent bonn potential , however , has been fit to the 1999 database , consisting of 2932 @xmath1@xmath1 and 3058 @xmath0@xmath1 data , for which it gives @xmath19 per datum of 1.01 and 1.02 , respectively  @xcite . the substantial increase in the number of @xmath1@xmath1 data",
    "is due to the development of novel experimental techniques ",
    "internally polarized gas targets and stored , cooled beams . indeed ,",
    "using this technology , iucf has produced a large number of @xmath1@xmath1 spin - correlation parameters of very high precision , see for example ref .",
    "it is worth noting that the av18 potential , as an example , fits the post-1992 and both pre- and post-1992 @xmath1@xmath1 ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) data with @xmath19 s of 1.74 ( 1.02 ) and 1.35 ( 1.07 ) , respectively  @xcite .",
    "therefore , while the quality of their fits ( to the @xmath1@xmath1 data ) has deteriorated somewhat in regard to the extended 1999-database , the av18 and nijm - i models can still be considered realistic .    as already mentioned in sec .",

    "@xcite and later papers , the currents from the spin - orbit term were derived by generalizing the procedure used to obtain the @xmath60 currents .",
    "it was assumed that the isospin - independent ( isospin - dependent ) central and spin - orbit interactions were due to @xmath62 and @xmath8 exchanges ( @xmath7 exchange ) , and the associated two - body currents were constructed by considering corresponding @xmath63@xmath64-pair diagrams involving these meson exchanges .",

    "for example , in the case of the isospin - dependent @xmath61 and @xmath65 interactions , this commutator requires the presence of currents with the isospin structure @xmath66 , which can not be generated by minimal substitution  @xcite .",

    "their contributions to isovector observables , such as , for example , the magnetic form factors of the trinucleons  @xcite , are found to be numerically much smaller than those due to the leading @xmath60 currents .",
    "these currents also lead to small , although non - negligible , corrections to isoscalar observables , such as the deuteron magnetic moment and @xmath67 structure function  @xcite .",

    "we find that the model dependence of the @xmath12@xmath1-capture asymmetry is quite small , at a level similar to the expected contributions of the short - range parts of the interaction .",
    "this process is in fact dominated by the long - range interaction components associated with pion exchange .",
    "a measurement of the @xmath12@xmath1-capture asymmetry is then a clean probe of that physics .",
    "similarly , we find that the asymmetry in the @xmath4 reaction at quasi - elastic kinematics is a very clean probe of the electro - weak properties of individual nucleons .",
    "the processes associated with two nucleons , including pv admixtures in the deuteron and scattering wave functions and electromagnetic two - body currents induced by hadronic weak interactions , play a very small role at the values of momentum transfers explored so far  @xcite .",
    "we also find that the neutron spin rotation is sensitive to both the pion and vector - meson pv couplings to the nucleon , while exhibiting a modest model dependence , at the level of 5 - 10% , due to the input strong - interaction potential adopted in the calculation .",
    "thus a measurement of this observable  @xcite , when combined with measurements of the asymmetries in @xmath12@xmath1 radiative capture  @xcite and @xmath16@xmath1 elastic scattering  @xcite , could provide useful constraints for some of these pv amplitudes .",
    "the asymmetry in the deuteron disintegration by circularly polarized photons from threshold up to 20 mev energies is dominated by the short - range components of the ddh interaction .",
    "however , it also displays enhanced sensitivity to the short - range behavior in the strong - interaction potentials .",
    "indeed , predictions for the asymmetry at threshold differ by almost a factor of two , depending on whether the argonne @xmath5 or bonn 2000 interactions are used in the calculations .",
    "therefore , this observable can not provide an unambiguous value of short - range weak meson nucleon couplings ; however , they would be valuable in placing constraints on the hadronic weak mixing angles .",
    "finally , the issue of electromagnetic current conservation in the presence of parity - conserving ( pc ) and pv potetials has been carefully investigated .",

    "<S> the complete bound and scattering problems in the presence of parity - conserving , including electromagnetic , and parity - violating potentials is solved in both configuration and momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> the issue of electromagnetic current conservation is examined carefully . </S>",
    "<S> we find large cancellations between the asymmetries induced by the parity - violating interactions and those arising from the associated pion - exchange currents . in the @xmath2@xmath1 capture , </S>",
    "<S> the model dependence is nevertheless quite small , because of constraints arising through the siegert evaluation of the relevant @xmath9 matrix elements . in </S>",
    "<S> quasi - elastic electron scattering these processes are found to be insignificant compared to the asymmetry produced by @xmath10-@xmath11 interference on individual nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> these two experiments , then , provide clean probes of different aspects of weak - interaction physics associated with parity violation in the @xmath0@xmath1 system . finally , we find that the neutron spin rotation in @xmath12@xmath1 elastic scattering and asymmetry in deuteron disintegration by circularly - polarized photons exhibit significant sensitivity both to the values used for the weak vector - meson couplings in the ddh model and to the input strong - interaction potential adopted in the calculation . this reinforces the conclusion that these short - ranged meson couplings are not in themselves physical observables , rather the parity - violating mixings are the physically relevant parameters . </S>"
