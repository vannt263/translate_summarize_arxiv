    "there are many different physical systems for which contact line dynamics plays an important role .",
    "these range from large scale industrial processes , such as oil recovery and coating , to micron scale phenomena , such as flow in microfluidic channels or the movement of drops across micropatterned surfaces . despite its importance ,",
    "contact line dynamics is still a challenging problem that has not been fully solved .",
    "this is partly because it is an inherently multiscale problem .",
    "the hydrodynamic flow of the fluids far away from the three phase contact line has to be matched to the microscopic details of the contact line motion @xcite .",
    "in particular , a mechanism is needed by which the usual hydrodynamic , no - slip boundary condition can be violated in the vicinity of the contact line @xcite .",
    "one solution to this problem has been to consider a class of hydrodynamic models , called diffuse interface models @xcite , where the interface at the contact line has a finite width . as a diffuse interface",
    "is pushed across a surface it is pulled out of equilibrium .",
    "this leads to diffusive transport of fluid across the interface and hence an effective slip at the contact line . here",
    "we shall consider a diffuse interface model for a binary fluid , where the equilibrium properties of the fluid are described by a landau free energy functional .",
    "the equilibrium contact angle is controlled by a surface term in the free energy .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations of motion of diffuse interface models can be solved in many different ways , but in this paper , we shall focus on one particular mesoscopic modelling technique , the lattice boltzmann method @xcite . lattice boltzmann simulations have been succesfully used to study several contact line problems .",
    "examples include the spreading of drops on chemically patterned @xcite and superhydrophobic surfaces @xcite , modelling of contact angle hysteresis @xcite , and capillary filling in microfluidic channels @xcite .",
    "the majority of previous work on binary fluids has concentrated on the case where the two components have equal viscosity . in this case",
    "a simple and widely used lattice boltzmann approach , the bgk algorithm , works well , agreeing with analytical results for the equilibrium contact angle .",
    "however , if the two binary components have different viscosities , this is no longer the case : we shall show that the equilibrium contact angle is predicted incorrectly by the algorithm because there are severe spurious velocities in the steady state .",
    "there are several important aspects of the behaviour of multicomponent fluids where it is essential or highly desirable to be able to model a two component fluid , where the components have different viscosities .",
    "these include drops moving on surfaces , where the viscosity of the surrounding fluid must be substantially smaller than that of the drop to access a rolling regime , instabilities such as viscous fingering which are driven by a viscosity difference between the two fluid components , and capillary filling , where the simple theories assume that the displaced fluid has zero viscosity .    in this paper",
    "we identify two primary reasons for the spurious currents in bgk lattice boltzmann simulations of contact line hydrodynamics .",
    "we show how the spurious effects can be greatly suppressed by using an algorithm based on a multiple - relaxation - time lattice boltzmann approach .",
    "we demonstrate that the new algorithm gives excellent agreement with theory , both for the equilibrium contact angle , and for the advancing contact angle , measured in capillary filling simulations .",
    "the paper is organised in the following way : we begin , in sec .  [ secbin ] , by introducing the free energy model for a binary fluid system .",

    "[ fig2](a ) ) , but there are large errors for @xmath101 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ) . in the next section",
    "we discuss the reasons behind this discrepancy .",
    "the reason that the single relaxation time lattice boltzmann approach gives an incorrect equilibrium contact angle for @xmath102 is that near to the contact point there are strong spurious velocities which continuously push the system out of equilibrium and result in the deformation of the drop .",
    "note that even when the surface is neutrally wetting , @xmath92 , the wetting angle measured numerically is @xmath103 larger than the expected value of @xmath104 .",
    "we focus on this case and replace the drop geometry with a simpler system consisting of a stripe of component @xmath65 between two neutrally wetting walls , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "this simulation was performed for a system of size @xmath105 lattice units using a large relaxation parameter @xmath106 .",
    "note that we do observe the correct @xmath91 contact angle in this case , but only because the viscosities of the two phases are the same .",
    "if we set @xmath107 then the stripe becomes barrel shaped , consistent with the measurements reported in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .    the black arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) show the steady - state , spurious velocity field in the system .",
    "the magnitude of the velocities is typically of order @xmath108 .",
    "we have identified two contributions to the spurious velocities ; one from long range effects , a second from the bounce back boundary conditions .",
    "we discuss each in turn .      for a unbounded , system at steady - state ,",
    "it is possible , by iterating the lattice boltzmann evolution equation ( [ latbolt ] ) , to write the particle distribution function at any given lattice point in terms of equilibrium distributions along lines defined by the lattice velocity vector directions : @xmath109 note that when @xmath110 this reduces to @xmath111 .",
    "this special case could be described as ` local ' , in the sense that the particle distribution function only depends on the equilibria of its neighbours .    when @xmath112 , contributions to the sum in eq .",
    "( [ ss ] ) decay with a characteristic length @xmath113^{-1}\\delta x. \\label{decay}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this diverges as @xmath114 .",

    "( [ kine ] ) becoming zero . )",
    "therefore , for @xmath82 both high and low , the distribution at any given point is dependent on other nodes a long distance away .    even without the presence of solid boundaries , it has been noted that these long range interactions can give rise to large spurious currents around curved interfaces @xcite . in particular , the size of the spurious velocities scales as @xmath118 for large @xmath82 , so choosing @xmath82 large is not advisable .",
    "the problem becomes even more acute in the presence of solid boundaries .",
    "figure [ fig1](b ) schematically shows the situation for a particular lattice node @xmath72 close to the contact point .",
    "because we focus on the case of neutrally wetting walls ( contact angle @xmath119 ) , this allows us to compare two systems we expect to have the same steady state configuration , _",
    "i.e. _ a rectangular stripe of fluid at rest .",
    "in the first , simpler system we imagine that the walls have been replaced by periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath120-direction . in this case , contributions to eq .",
    "( [ ss ] ) radiate out indefinitely in all @xmath121 directions .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) by the filled circles , each of which denote a term in the sum on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ss ] ) .",
    "( note , the arrows indicate the direction of motion for the distribution function from which each term originates . )",
    "because the boundaries have been removed , the symmetry of the system implies that any point above or below @xmath72 at the same value of @xmath122 must behave exactly the same as @xmath72 .",
    "since there can be no net flux of fluid across any given plane ( as this would lead to non - conservation of mass ) , then in steady state , the system must be at rest . it can be numerically confirmed that no steady state spurious velocities are generated in this case .    in the second system ,",
    "the periodic boundary conditions are replaced with bounce back boundary conditions , and we now discuss what implications this has . in particular , eq .  ( [ ss ] )",
    "needs to be modified to take into account the fact that the contributions to the sum do not extend indefinitely in all @xmath121 directions because of the presence of the boundaries .",
    "this is illustrated at point @xmath123 in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , where the remaining terms in the sum , which would have originated in the direction of @xmath124 , come , in fact , from a reflected branch in the direction of @xmath72 .",
    "because of the interface in the system , these two paths give significatly different contributions to the sum .",
    "therefore , the reflection of branches at the boundary breaks the symmetry of the system in the @xmath120 direction .",
    "( this can clearly be seen if we compare point a to a point on the boundary , where the incoming branches are reflected immediately . )",
    "this broken symmetry leads to the generation of the spurious , steady state velocities .",
    "the range around the contact point over which this spurious force is active is determined by the decay lengths @xmath125 in eqs .",
    "( [ decay ] ) and ( [ decay2 ] )",
    ". for high or low viscosities @xmath125 is large and this is a long range effect . correcting for it at the boundary involves extrapolating into the surface to predict , for example , the density variation down the dotted branches near to @xmath124",
    "this is relatively simple for the @xmath91 case shown , as the unknown nodes can be obtained by reflecting the system across the boundary .",
    "however , in the case of arbitrary contact angle the situation is much more complicated and a general solution is far from clear .    thus implementing solid boundaries in the multi - component bgk lattice boltzmann is only advisable in the case @xmath110 .",
    "( for the same reason it is best to choose @xmath63 @xcite .",
    ") however , to simulate phases with different viscosities it is not possible to use @xmath110 in both phases . in sec .",
    "[ algorithm ] we discuss how using a multiple - relaxation - time method can be used to overcome this restriction",
    ".      a second source of spurious velocities at the contact point is the bounce - back boundary conditions . to understand what goes wrong with the boundary conditions for the binary lattice boltzmann model it is first important to understand why they work well when simulating a single - component fluid .",
    "[ fig9](a ) illustrates the mid - link , bounce - back process for one dimension . during the streaming the population *",
    "a * moves down the link , is reflected , and then travels back to the node it came from but moving in the opposite direction .",

    "[ fig9](c ) shows the distribution for a typical node in a system describing a single component fluid at equilibrium .",
    "this is a representation of the maxwell boltzmann distribution using a discrete number of velocity vectors .",
    "the bounce - back method acts at the boundaries of the system to switch some of the populations to travel in the opposite direction .",
    "because this distribution is invariant under a parity transformation ( that is replacing velocity vectors @xmath17 by @xmath126 ) then the correct distribution is preserved by the bounce - back boundary .",
    "when the system is in a state of shear the particle distribution function , in the rest frame of the fluid , is as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig9](d ) .",
    "while this is clearly not isotropic , it still preserves invariance under the parity transformation and hence the bounce - back approach is still valid .",
    "( in fact , if non - slip boundary conditions are enforced by setting the particle distribution at the boundary to its equilibrium value at rest , an inaccurate shear velocity profile is obtained .",
    "this is because the shear - induced distortion of the distribution function is not preserved at the boundaries . )",
    "we now return to the binary fluid case . fig .",
    "[ fig9](e ) shows the distribution function for a typical node , lying at rest in a fluid - fluid interface .",
    "( in this particular example the interface lies perpendicular to the surface , hence the distribution has an up - down symmetry . )",
    "note that because of the @xmath8 terms in the pressure tensor ( [ pressten ] ) the parity invariance is broken .",
    "we consider the case when the position of the node is @xmath127 above a boundary and mid - link bounce - back boundary conditions are being employed .",
    "[ fig9](f ) illustrates the situation after the bounce back step , and it clearly shows that the new distribution is not the same as in ( e ) ( in particular , vector @xmath128 is shortened and @xmath129 lengthened ) .",
    "therefore , bounce - back collisions result in the system continually being pushed out of equilibrium , leading to the generation of spurious velocities on or near to boundaries close to the interface between the two phases .",
    "for @xmath110 , the distribution function is automatically set to its equilibrium value at each time step . while the typical distribution function in the interface is not invariant under a parity transformation ,",
    "the equilibrium distribution is .",
    "hence the spurious velocities caused by bounce back boundary conditions are suppressed in this case .",
    "we now describe how an algorithm based on the multiple - relaxation - time lattice boltzmann approach can be used to significantly reduce the spurious currents at the contact point .",
    "the approach comprises the following four steps :    * step 1 : * calculate the density , concentration and velocity using the moments defined by eq .",
    "( [ moments ] ) .",
    "* step 2 : * set the velocity of boundary nodes to zero when calculating the equilibrium distribution function .",
    "* step 3 : * use the multiple - relaxation - time lattice boltzmann method described in sec .",
    "[ mrt ] to perform the collision step .",
    "* step 4 : * perform the streaming step with bounce - back at the boundaries .    to justify this choice we need to consider the hydrodynamic and the non - hydrodynamic modes separately . from a hydrodynamic point of view , a non - slip boundary fixes the velocity at that boundary to zero .",
    "if the fluid is incompressible , then near to the boundary the fluid flow profile can always be approximated by a shear profile , with streamlines parallel to the surface . in section [ spurious]b",
    "we argued that for a shear profile , the hydrodynamic modes , which are represented by the difference between figs .",
    "[ fig9](c ) and ( d ) , are invariant under a parity transformation , and so are preserved by the bounce - back method .",
    "another interpretation of this is that , for the hydrodynamic modes , the contributions at a in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] from the reflected branches are the same as those when periodic boundary conditions are considered ( provided @xmath130 is smaller than the length scale over which the shear profile approximation breaks down as we move away from the boundary ) . in summary ,",
    "the hydrodynamic modes behave correctly for both the single and multiple - relaxation - time lattice boltzmann models .",
    "the difference lies in the treatment of the non - hydrodynamic modes .    in the multiple - relaxation - time scheme , because we have chosen @xmath110 for the non - hydrodynamic modes ( this choice corresponds to the 1 s in eq .",
    "( [ diag ] ) ) , the spurious velocities generated from long ranged effects in the bulk are immediately removed .",
    "this justifies the use of the multiple - relaxation - time algorithm in step 3 .",
    "the only potential problem that remains is on the boundary nodes themselves .",
    "as discussed at the end of section [ spurious]b , the distribution function in the interface between fluid phases is not invariant under a parity transformation .",
    "this generates spurious velocities at any boundary node in an interface immediately after the streaming step 4 .",
    "this problem is remedied by the introduction of step 2 .",
    "note that this step is consistent with non - slip boundary conditions and does not affect the hydrodynamic correlations ( i.e. the non symmetric distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig9](d ) ) .    for a system with variable viscosity it would seem necessary to recalculate the collision matrix @xmath131 in at each lattice node and at each time - step .",
    "this would be extremely slow computationally and not very practical .",
    "the approach we take is to create a lookup table with @xmath132 different values of viscosity and simply pick the closest match .",
    "we find that implementing multiple - relaxation - time lattice boltzmann with appropriate boundary conditions leads to a significant improvement in the accuracy of the equilibrium contact angle .",
    "the results of simulations for @xmath67 , @xmath68 , are denoted by the crosses in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , and show very good agreement with the theoretical , dashed curve .",
    "deviation is only noticeable at small contact angles .",
    "this happens for two reasons : firstly , the dynamics of drop wetting become very slow as the equilibrium contact angle becomes small , and so the assumption of quasi - static equilibrium , as the gradient in @xmath4 is slowly reduced , breaks down .",
    "( tanner s law @xcite states that for a completely wetting surface in two dimensions , the size of a drop spreading on the surface scales as @xmath133 in time . )",
    "secondly , the finite width of the interface @xmath134 , which is neglected when assuming that the drop should be made up of a circular section , becomes comparable to the height of the drop .",
    "we have shown that the equilibrium contact angle is accurately recovered in lattice boltzmann simulations for a binary system with different viscosities only when a multiple - relaxation - time approach is employed .",
    "while this highlights a problem with the single relaxation time binary lattice boltzmann model , contact angle measurement is a static problem . in this section",
    "we concentrate on the dynamics of a fluid penetrating a smooth microchannel to measure how the advancing contact angle changes with the velocity of the fluid interface .",

    "however , the two methods provide different quantitative results , in particular , capillary filling is considerably slower for the single - relaxation - time method .",
    "the difference can be explained by considering how the advancing contact angle varies with the velocity of the interface , @xmath152 .",
    "to lowest order in the capillary number , ca@xmath153 , the advancing contact angle is related to the equilibrium angle and the capillary number by @xcite @xmath154 where @xmath155 is a constant , @xmath156 is the length scale of the system and @xmath157 is the effective slip length at the three phase contact line . figs .",
    "[ washburnfig](b ) and ( d ) show the expected linear decrease of the measured contact angle with capillary number @xcite . for the multiple - relaxation - time algorithm , the advancing contact angle tends to the correct value as @xmath158 .",
    "we obtain @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath160 for @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 respectively . for the bgk method , however , @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 for @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 , and the advancing angle is consistently higher for all values of ca than for the multi - relaxation - time solution .",
    "( this result agrees with that presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , which shows that the measured equilibrium contact angle is too high in the single - relaxation - time approach . ) since the speed of capillary filling depends on @xmath167 ( [ washburnlaw ] ) , capillary filling is considerably slower using this method .    in diffuse interface models of binary fluids",
    "the contact line singularity is relieved by inter - diffusion of the two fluid components .",
    "this is governed by the mobility @xmath19 ; as is apparent from fig .",
    "[ washburnfig ] , increasing @xmath19 increases the rate of diffusion and hence the velocity of the contact line .",
    "therefore the parameter @xmath19 can be used to tune the effective slip length @xmath157 .",
    "we have shown that , if the lattice boltzmann relaxation parameter @xmath102 , strong spurious currents drive the contact line out of equilibrium even in a system at rest .",
    "this means that the algorithm gives incorrect values for the contact angle . in many applications it is possible to choose @xmath168 , thus avoiding the problem .",
    "however this parameter controls the fluid viscosity and so can not be held at unity for both phases of a binary fluid if the two components have different viscosities .",
    "we demonstrate that the spurious currents arise primarily from two effects .",
    "the first is a long - range contribution to the equilibrium distribution function near the contact line that effectively originates in the incorrect phase .",
    "the second is the bounce - back boundary conditions which drive the interface out of equilibrium .",
    "aiming to reduce the unwanted velocities we propose a revised lattice boltzmann method , based on a multiple - relaxation - time algorithm .",
    "we show that the simulations then agree well with the analytical result for the equilibrium contact angle .",
    "moreover the dynamic , advancing contact angle shows the expected physical behaviour , with a slip length that depends on the diffusivity of the fluid .    using this method it will be possible to perform accurate simulations of a binary fluid where the two components have different viscosities .",
    "examples of problems where the algorithm will prove useful include viscous fingering , rolling of viscous drops and capillary filling .",
    "moreover , it can provide a useful approximation to a liquid - gas system in the limit that evaporation - condensation is not important .",
    "we list the best choice of equilibrium distributions and stencils for calculating spatial derivatives for the lattice boltzmann algorithms we have considered in this paper , based on reducing the magnitude of spurious velocities near to interfaces ( a detailed account is given in @xcite ) .",
