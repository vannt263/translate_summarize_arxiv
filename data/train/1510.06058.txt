    "long - lived atomic coherences play an important role in precision measurements .",
    "for example , in the phenomenon of nonlinear magneto - optic rotation ( nmor ) , a laser field is used to align the atom by inducing coherences among the magnetic sublevels of the ground state .",
    "nmor has important applications in sensitive magnetometry @xcite , and the search for a permanent electric dipole moment ( edm ) in an atom @xcite .",
    "another example is an atomic clock , where two laser beams which differ in frequency by the clock transition are used to put the atom in a dark non - absorbing state .",
    "the phenomenon of coherent population trapping ( cpt ) @xcite is then used to get a narrow resonance at exactly the clock frequency .",
    "both these kinds of equipments gain from having a vapor cell filled with buffer gas @xcite , or anti - relaxation ( paraffin ) coating on the walls @xcite .",
    "this reduces the spin relaxation rate and increases the coherence time , thus resulting in a narrower linewidth .    in this work",
    ", we demonstrate the tuning of coherences in the hanle effect from enhanced absorption to enhanced transparency .",
    "previous work in this field has studied the two phenomena  electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) and electromagnetically induced absorption ( eia)in the hanle configuration , but only separately @xcite . in addition , previous experiments and their theoretical explanations have required the presence of one or more control fields .",
    "this is the first time that a single laser beam is used , and its absorption changed from eia to eit simply by changing its polarization from linear to circular .",
    "the experiments are done on the d@xmath0 line of cs at 852 nm , using the closed hyperfine transition @xmath1 . the explanation based on optical pumping and coherences among the magnetic sublevels of the ground state",
    "is borne out by a density matrix calculation .",
    "the cs vapor cell used has paraffin coating on the walls .",
    "this anti - relaxation coating results in a narrow linewidth of about 1 mg ( 175 hz ) .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to previous work , a small transverse magnetic field  of order 0.1 mg  is necessary for the circular polarization effect .",
    "experimentally , a small transverse field is always present because of imperfect shielding by the magnetic shield .",
    "the experimental set up is shown schematically in fig .  [",
    "fig : hanleexpt ] .",
    "the laser beam is derived from a commercial diode laser system ( toptica dl pro ) operating near the 852 nm @xmath2 line of cs .",
    "the laser output comes out of a single - mode polarization - maintaining fiber .",
    "the fiber goes into a 95/5 power splitter , with @xmath3 of the power fed to a toptica compact doppler - free spectroscopy ( cosy ) unit .",
    "this provides a saturated - absorption signal , so that the laser can be locked to any hyperfine transition .",
    "the remaining @xmath4 of the power is coupled to free space using a fiber coupler .",
    "the output goes into a glan - taylor prism , which serves the dual purpose of controlling the power ( using a half - wave retardation plate ) , and making the polarization almost perfectly linear ( because the extinction for the orthogonal polarization is better then @xmath5 ) .",
    "a quarter - wave plate after the prism is used to control the ellipticity of the beam .",
    "the laser beam after the free - space coupler has a size ( @xmath6 diameter ) of 3 mm and its power is adjusted to @xmath7 w. it goes into a spherical cs vapor cell with 75 mm diameter and paraffin coating on the walls .",
    "the cell is inside a 3-layer magnetic shield with a shielding factor of better then @xmath8 .",
    "the required longitudinal field for the hanle effect is obtained by placing the cell inside a solenoid coil .",
    "the solenoid is wound on a plastic form of 190 mm diameter .",
    "it consists of 1800 turns of 0.35 mm magnet wire wound tightly over a length of 640 mm .",
    "transverse fields are applied using a set of coils on a square form of 106 mm diameter .",
    "the power of the laser beam after it passes through the cell is measured using an amplified photodiode .",
    "we first look at the sublevel structure of the relevant hyperfine transition .",
    "@xmath9cs has two values of @xmath10 in the ground state  @xmath11 and 4 . the complete magnetic sublevel structure for the @xmath12 transition",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transition ] .",
    "transitions coupled by linear and circular polarizations , along with each transition strength , are shown separately .",
    "( @xmath13 line ) of @xmath14 for the hyperfine transition @xmath12 .",
    "transitions coupled by linear polarization are shown on top , while transitions coupled by circular polarization @xmath15 are shown below .",
    "the strength of each transition is indicated . ]",
    "the experimental results for the closed @xmath12 transition are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eita4to5 ] . the hanle effect as the longitudinal magnetic field",
    "is scanned results in a typical narrow resonance near zero field .",
    "the resonance shows either enhanced absorption ( eia ) for linear polarization , or enhanced transmission ( eit ) for circular polarization .",
    "since the group velocity of light depends on the ( equivalent ) dispersion @xcite , the medium can be tuned from `` slow '' light to `` fast '' light simply by changing the ellipticity of the beam .     transition .",
    "measured photodiode voltage as a function of longitudinal field shows transformation from enhanced absorption for linear polarization to enhanced absorption for circular polarization . ]",
    "the measured photodiode voltage is shown directly on the graph .",
    "this gives an idea both of the absorption off resonance ( high magnetic fields ) , and of the percentage absorption near resonance .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the change is very small ( @xmath16 ) for the linear case , whereas it is very high ( @xmath17 ) for the circular case .",
    "in fact , this makes the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) very poor for the linear case  as a consequence the spectrum shown is obtained after averaging over 100 individual traces .",
    "the resonances are not centered at zero field because of a small residual field inside the shield  both longitudinal and transverse .",
    "the residual longitudinal field causes a shift from zero , whereas the transverse field is required for the circular polarization effect ( as explained in the `` theoretical analysis '' section below ) .",
    "while a small transverse field is required for the circular case , the larger it is the weaker is the signal for the linear case .",
    "therefore , an external field  of order 0.1 mg  is applied , and adjusted so that the linear - polarization signal is a maximum .",
    "this is different from other hanle experiments where the transverse field is either unimportant or nulled .",
    "the obtained linewidth of about 1 mg is limited by spin relaxation , which destroy the coherences among the zeeman sublevels .",
    "therefore , the experiments gain by the use of a paraffin - coated vapor cell , as described in the experimental section .",
    "in order to verify that the experimental results match theoretical understanding , we have done a theoretical calculation of the same .",
    "the calculations were carried out using the atomic density matrix ( adm ) package for mathematica written by simon rochester ( http://rochesterscientific.com/adm/ ) .",
    "it solves numerically a set of density - matrix equations for the levels involved .",
    "the calculation takes as input(i ) the two @xmath18 values for the transition , ( ii ) the light intensity , and ( iii ) the polarization ellipticity .",
    "experimental parameters of incident power of 100 w in a size of 3 mm , a small transverse field of 0.1 mg , and an interaction length corresponding to the cell size of 75 mm were taken .",
    "the atomic number density was taken to be @xmath19 atoms / cc , which corresponds to a vapor pressure of 1 torr ( that is correct for cs vapor at room temperature ) .",
    "the intensity was assumed to decay exponentially due to absorption along the beam path .",
    "the simulation assumed two regions  labeled a and b  with different hamiltonians , because both the light and magnetic field are present in region a while only the magnetic field is present in region b. the atoms relax from region a to region b ( transit - time relaxation ) at a rate of 50 khz , which corresponds to the most - probable velocity going across the beam size of 3 mm .",
    "the atoms come back from region b to region a at a rate of 2 khz , determined roughly by the ratio of cell volume to interaction volume .",
    "finally , the relaxation rate at which coherences are lost ( due to collisions with the cell wall ) is taken to be 25 hz , chosen to match the linewidth seen in our related nmor experiments @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is doppler - averaged over the maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution appropriate for cs atoms at room temperature .",
    "we now consider the results of the calculation as a function of longitudinal field , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eita4to5_sim ] .",
    "the most interesting thing to note is that it reproduces the observed transformation from enhanced absorption for linear polarization to enhanced transmission for circular polarization .",
    "the simulation does not reproduce the percentage change in each case , mainly because the simplistic calculation not take into account velocity - changing collisions , and assumes that the intensity is uniform across the beam .",
    "transition , showing transformation from enhanced absorption to enhanced transmission exactly as for the experimental results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eita4to5 ] . ]",
    "the above simulation can be understood qualitatively by referring to the sublevel structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transition ] . for linearly polarized light ,",
    "both the quantization axis and polarization axis are taken to be along the @xmath20 direction , i.e.  orthogonal to the direction of light propagation .",
    "the figure shows that atoms tend to get optically pumped to the @xmath21 sublevel .",
    "this level absorbs strongly , as seen from the transition strength shown in the figure .",
    "when a longitudinal field applied , there is sublevel mixing which results in reduction in absorption . to understand what happens with circular polarization",
    ", we assume that it is right circularly polarized ( @xmath22 ) and that the quantization axis is along the @xmath23 direction ( light propagation direction ) .",
    "the atoms then get optically pumped to the @xmath24 stretch sublevel . in the presence of a small transverse field , there is mixing of the sublevels and some residual absorption . as the applied longitudinal field",
    "is increased , the relative size of the transverse field becomes smaller , hence the mixing is less and absorption increases  showing the importance of the transverse field . thus the transformation is from enhanced absorption for linear polarization to enhanced transmission for circular polarization , exactly as seen experimentally .",
    "in summary , we have shown that the hanle effect can be tuned from eia to eit by changing the ellipticity of polarization of the input laser beam .",
    "the experiments are done on the d@xmath0 line of cs at 852 nm , using the closed hyperfine transition @xmath1 , in a paraffin - coated vapor cell at room temperature .",
    "the observation is borne out by a density matrix calculation based on the levels involved .",
    "the results are also consistent with a qualitative explanation based on optical pumping and coherences among the magnetic sublevels of the ground state .",
    "this ability to tune the sign of the dispersion opens up new applications in fields such as slow light and quantum - information processing .",
