    "in the last years the need of enhancing the speed of modern spin - electronic and magneto - optic devices , and of further developing the magnetic storage technology , has stimulated many studies aimed at achieving a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of magnetization dynamics and switching .",
    "in addition to ultrafast magnetic field pulses which require complex devices for their generation , the spin dynamics has been induced by ultrafast optical laser pulses .",
    "recent experiments have shown that significant demagnetization of magnetic compounds can be measured on the scale of a few hundred femtoseconds . @xcite",
    "typically the light is absorbed by the material , giving rise to a rapid increase of temperature responsible for the change of magnetization @xcite and spin reorientation .",
    "@xcite the question concerning the exact speed of the initial sub - picosecond magnetization breakdown is still subject of debate and partly relates to the question of how to interpret magneto - optical experiments .",
    "@xcite furthermore , the cooling time could limit the repetition frequency whose value is fundamental for actual applications .",
    "@xcite    recently , non - thermal ultrafast optical control of magnetization has been achieved in canted antiferromagnet samples of dysprosium orthoferrites by using circularly polarized femtosecond pulses .",
    "@xcite via the inverse faraday effect , the light excitation acts on the spins of the system as a magnetic field pulse directed along the wave vector of the radiation and proportional to its intensity .",
    "@xcite the inverse faraday effect does not rely on absorption and has its fingerprint in the fact that the helicity of the pump controls the sign of the photo - induced magnetization .",
    "this effect plays a role also in the femtosecond photomagnetic switching of spins in ferromagnetic garnet films.@xcite    since the manipulation of spins by means of circularly polarized laser pulses represents an advance in the field of ultrafast magnetization dynamics , we analyze thoroughly the experimental work by kimel _",
    "_ @xcite and discuss its pecularities . in this experiment the difference between the faraday rotations induced by right- and left - handed polarized pulses has been studied in the temperature range between 20 k and 175 k. a characteristic spin - wave mode , called quasi - antiferro mode , is excited by the light pulse along the z - direction .",
    "when the sample is heated , the frequency of the mode oscillations increases and the amplitude decreases from the low - temperature maximum value of the order of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the saturation magnetization .",
    "we point out that there is no theoretical explanation concerning the magnitude and the temperature behavior of the oscillations .",
    "furthermore , some aspects of the cited experiment deserve attention .",
    "actually , in the so called @xmath2 phase , stable at temperatures higher than 50 k , the oscillations have temperature - dependent frequencies in full agreement with those measured by raman experiments .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , at temperatures below 50 k , the frequency of the photoinduced magnetization stays constant in contrast with the results of the raman spectra and other measurements which signal the discontinuous transition to another phase , called @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the experimental data obtained by laser pulses reflect the excitation of resonance modes characteristic of the @xmath2 phase even at very low temperatures .",
    "finally , the field pulse is also directed along the x - axis : another spin - wave mode , called quasi - ferro mode , is excited and is characterized by an extraordinarily , not well understood , small amplitude .    in order to obtain a deeper understanding of the non - thermal control of magnetization , in this paper",
    "we perform simulations related to the experiment by kimel _",
    "@xcite we have studied the magnetization dynamics employing a model for orthoferrites that was previously proposed for the analysis of resonance and high - frequency susceptibility .",
    "@xcite the parameters of the free energy , such as the symmetric and antisymmetric exchange , and the anisotropy constants , are determined by using the experimental raman spectra of ref.17 .",
    "the dynamical behavior is described by solving two coupled sublattice nonlinear landau - lifshitz - gilbert equations through a fifth - order runge - kutta algorithm .",
    "the damping term in the dynamical equations is related to magnon - magnon interaction and its temperature behavior is provided by a calculation of the scattering rate in orthoferrites .",
    "@xcite exploiting the inverse faraday effect , we have analyzed the effect of gaussian magnetic field pulses whose time width is of the order of hundred femtoseconds . since , in the regime considered in the experiments , the effective magnetic fields are not large if compared with exchange fields , the solution of the linearized system represents a reasonable approximation to the numerical results .",
    "therefore we have studied the dynamics within the linear solution after the excitation by a pulse shaped as a delta function , since the magnetic field pulse takes place on a time scale shorter than the period of the resonance modes .",
    "one result of this work is that , in the @xmath2 phase , the quasi - antiferro mode of the magnetization is excited by a field pulse along the z - axis and the oscillations have amplitudes in agreement with experimental results .",
    "moreover , the oscillations induced by pulses directed along the z and -z axis show the characteristic out - of - phase behavior .",
    "we point out that , even for the dynamics , the ratio between the antisymmetric and symmetric exchange energies is important .",
    "furthermore , we stress that in the canted antiferromagnets , such as rare - earth orthoferrites , the largest amplitudes of the oscillation are not obtained for the ferromagnetic sum vector of the sublattice magnetizations but for the antiferromagnetic difference vector .",
    "the behavior of the magnetization has been analyzed in the temperature range between 20 k and 175 k. the damping process based on magnon - magnon scattering describes the decay of the oscillations with results consistent with the experiment .",
    "the case of the field pulse directed along the x - axis has been analyzed in the @xmath2 phase .",
    "the magnetization along the x - axis oscillates with the frequency of the quasi - ferro mode as found in the experiment .",
    "however , the calculated and the experimental amplitudes of the oscillation are different if the magnetic field pulse along the x - axis has the same intensity of that along the z - axis .",
    "therefore , in the comparison with experimental data , we discuss the role of anisotropies between z and x directions as a source of discrepancy between theory and experiment .    finally , we consider the actual stable phase in equilibrium at low temperatures , the @xmath3 phase , and its resonance modes .",
    "we point out that the difference in energy between the @xmath3 and @xmath2 can be very small , so that even a small laser - heating effect could be responsible for the stabilization of the @xmath2 phase at very low temperatures on a picosecond time scale .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the numerical approach for the system and the analytic solution of the linearized equations for excitation by a delta function shaped magnetic field pulse .",
    "section iii provides the numerical and analytical results : in the first and second subsection the excitation due to the pulses along the z - axis and x - axis , respectively , is analyzed when the system at equilibrium is in the @xmath2 phase . in the final subsection the effect on the dynamics of a @xmath3 phase stable at low temperatures is considered .",
    "section iv provides a summary .",
    "rare - earth orthoferrites are represented by the formula @xmath4 , where @xmath5 stands for rare - earth .",
    "they have a perovskite - type structure with slight deformation from cubic to orthorombic . in many of them the spins of iron ions",
    "are antiferromagnetically aligned through a strong super - exchange interaction with a nel transition temperature of about 700k . moreover ,",
    "promoted by the orthorombic deformation , an antisymmetric exchange interaction acts between iron spins , resulting in spin canted magnetism with a feeble saturation moment . in the case of dysprosium orthoferrites , the temperature dependence of the ferromagnetic moment",
    "is characterized by a steep rise around 50 k in coincidence with the stabilization of the @xmath2 phase .",
    "@xcite actually these compounds are also known for their spin reorientation properties : continuous rotational - type ( ferromagnetism present in the low - temperature phase ) and , only for dysprosium , abrupt - type from @xmath3 ( antiferromagnetic ) to @xmath2 with increasing temperature .",
    "-3 mm    we use the free energy and the dynamical equations proposed in a previous work and focus on the behavior of the magnetization in the @xmath2 phase .",
    "@xcite the static and dynamical behavior is studied within the two - sublattice model for iron spins that takes into account the two active resonance modes .",
    "this represents an excellent approximation since the remaining resonance modes are almost inactive , and their interaction with active modes is negligible . in fig.1",
    "we show a schematic representation of equilibrium positions of two - sublattice magnetization vectors for dysprosium orthoferrites .",
    "@xcite    the normalized free energy @xmath6 , with @xmath7 the modulus of the sublattice magnetization , is composed of a part @xmath8 due to exchange interactions and a part @xmath9 due to the anisotropy : @xmath10 the free energy is expanded as a power series in the magnetization components and , in order to properly describe the @xmath2 phase , only quadratic terms are sufficient .",
    "the exchange energy is written as the sum of a scalar and a pseudo - vector part @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the symmetric and antisymmetric exchange fields , respectively , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the anisotropic energy is @xmath16 the exchange field @xmath12 is quite large compared to the other terms .",
    "it is related to the exchange spin - spin interaction @xmath17 via the equation @xmath18 , with @xmath19 the spin of iron ions , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 the bohr magneton .",
    "since @xmath17 is of the order of @xmath22 @xmath23 , @xmath12 is approximately @xmath24 oe .",
    "@xcite the field @xmath13 is related to the antisymmetrical exchange energy @xmath25 through the relation @xmath26 and is of the order of @xmath27 oe ( @xmath25 is about @xmath28 @xmath23 ) .",
    "the anisotropy constants @xmath29 and @xmath30 depend on temperature and are of the order of hundreds of oersted .    using the energy given in eq.([e0 ] ) , the equilibrium position can be derived for the @xmath2 phase .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "1 , where the small canting angle @xmath31 is determined by the equation @xmath32 hence the magnetization @xmath33 is two orders of magnitude less than @xmath7 .    the equilibrium position of @xmath34 and @xmath35 represents a stationary solution of the nonlinear landau - lifshitz - gilbert equations    @xmath36",
    "@xmath37    where @xmath38 mhz / oe is the gyroscopic ratio , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are gradients with respect to @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , and @xmath43 is the energy in eq.([e0 ] ) . clearly the dynamical equations satisfy the following constraints : @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the quantity @xmath46 in eqs.([e3],[e4 ] ) is the time - dependent magnetic field simulating the effect of laser pulses due to the inverse faraday effect . in the experiment by kimel _",
    "@xcite the magnetic field pulse is of the order of fractions of tesla with time width of hundred femtoseconds . in the numerical simulations we consider a pulse directed along the propagation direction of the light with a gaussian shape @xmath47 , \\label{e4a}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 defines the direction of the light wave - vector and @xmath49 indicates approximately the duration of the pulse .",
    "@xcite    finally , in eqs.([e3],[e4 ] ) @xmath50 is the gilbert constant . actually , @xmath50 takes into account the damping of the oscillations due to the magnon - magnon scattering and to the interaction of magnons with dysprosium spins and phonons .",
    "we notice that the scattering via dysprosium spins should be larger at very low temperatures where dysprosium ions tend to order .",
    "moreover , the phonon - magnon scattering should be effective only on the nanosecond time scale .",
    "@xcite it is the magnon - magnon interaction that provides the preminent source of scattering on the picosecond time scale .      in this subsection",
    "we consider the solution determined by linearizing eqs.([e3],[e4 ] ) and study the excitation of this linear system due to a magnetic field pulse shaped as a delta function .",
    "this is reasonable since , in the regime considered in the experiments , the effective magnetic fields are not large if compared with exchange fields , and the temporal width of the pulse is much smaller than the periods of the resonance modes .    in order to take into account small deviations from the equilibrium ,",
    "the standard approach is to consider two separate coordinate systems , ( @xmath51,@xmath52,@xmath53 ) and ( @xmath54,@xmath55,@xmath56 ) , which describe the dynamics of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "@xcite the variables @xmath51 and @xmath54 are chosen in order to coincide with the equilibrium positions of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , so that @xmath57 and @xmath58 by linearizing the system , we obtain the frequencies of two modes , the quasi - antiferro @xmath59 and the quasi - ferro @xmath60 modes , involving cooperative motions of spins of the two sublattices .",
    "the energy of the quasi - antiferro and quasi - ferro modes is of the order of several @xmath23 .",
    "the first mode is characterized by the frequency @xmath61 the dynamic in this mode shows the following behavior : @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , where @xmath65 , with @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 corresponding to the equilibrium position shown in fig.1 .",
    "thus , the only ferromagnetic component different from zero is the magnetization along the z - axis with respect to the equilibrium , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is defined by @xmath71 since the net spin does not reflect the motions of the sublattice spins , this mode is called quasi - antiferromagnetic .",
    "the second mode , with frequency @xmath72 is characterized by @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "since the net spin executes the same rocking behavior as the sublattice spins , this mode is called quasi - ferromagnetic .",
    "eqs.([e5],[e6 ] ) relate the mode frequencies to the model parameters .",
    "the exchange fields are assumed constant in temperature at the values given above , since they represent the highest energy scales . using eqs.([e5],[e6 ] ) and the experimentally measured raman spectra of ref.17 , we derive the anisotropy parameters .",
    "the quasi - antiferro mode increases linearly as a function of temperature in the @xmath2 phase : from 150 ghz at 50 k to 450 ghz at about 200 k , while the quasi - ferro mode stays constant at about 375 ghz .",
    "therefore the anisotropic terms change upon heating the sample : @xmath29 varies from about -640 oe at t=50 k to about 200 oe at t=200 k , @xmath30 from -1540 oe to -700 oe in the same temperature range , with approximately fixed @xmath76 oe . the knowledge of the frequencies is important also to determine the value of the damping constant in the dynamical equations ( [ e3],[e4 ] ) . indeed , if @xmath77 is the temperature - dependent frequency of one of the modes , the damping constant @xmath50 could be related to the damping rate @xmath78 by the relation @xmath79 . at the picosecond scale ,",
    "the dominant spin - wave damping is due to four - magnon scattering . by using many - body perturbation theory ,",
    "the rate for spin - wave at zero wave - vector is estimated to be @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 , with @xmath83 temperature in units of kelvin degrees .",
    "@xcite the scattering rate grows quadratically in temperature , while the frequency of the quasi - antiferro mode is an increasing linear function of the temperature .",
    "@xcite the quantity @xmath50 gets larger with temperature since the most important contribution is given by @xmath78 .",
    "actually , the values of @xmath50 corresponding to the quasi - antiferro mode range from about @xmath84 at t=50 k to @xmath85 at t=200 k. the smallness of @xmath50 implies that the oscillations of the magnetization are not strongly damped .",
    "it is useful to consider a magnetic field pulse shaped as a delta function @xmath86 since the pulse is instantaneous , it provides an initial condition to the dynamics described by the linearized equations of motions .",
    "we have analyzed two cases : field along z- and x - axis , since these are prominent for the experiment that we want to discuss .",
    "for the field along the z - axis , starting from the equilibrium position at @xmath87 , we find at @xmath88 @xmath89 \\\\",
    "\\delta y_1(0^+)&=&-\\delta y_2(0^+)= \\cos(\\beta_0 ) \\sin(\\gamma f_0 ) \\\\ \\delta z_1(0^+)&=&\\delta   z_2(0^+)=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "therefore this pulse will excite only the quasi - antiferro mode .    the field along the x - axis yields at @xmath88 @xmath90.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "thus the system will be excited in the quasi - ferro mode .    as the experimental field magnitude is lower than the exchange fields , we study the subsequent dynamical evolution within the linear approximation .",
    "@xcite within a relaxation time approximation , we include the damping time @xmath91 describing the decay towards the equilibrium position .",
    "@xcite    from the solution of the linear system in the case of a pulse along the z - axis , we get the evolution of the quasi - antiferro mode .",
    "the only ferromagnetic component , defined in eq.([e14a ] ) , is @xmath92 .",
    "\\label{e14}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we notice in eq.([e14 ] ) that the even terms in the magnetic field are at least two orders of magnitude less than the odd term .    along the other two directions ,",
    "there are the antiferromagnetic component along x - axis ( with respect to the equilibrium ) , @xmath93 , with @xmath94 defined as @xmath95 and the antiferromagnetic component along y - axis ( with respect to the equilibrium ) , @xmath96 , with @xmath97 @xmath98 using again the linearized form of eqs.([e3],[e4 ] ) , we obtain @xmath99 , \\label{e15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath100 the components specified in eqs.([e14],[e15],[e16 ] ) are determined by the mode frequency @xmath59 , the angle @xmath31 , and the quantity @xmath101 which depends on the model parameters in the form @xmath102 at intermediate temperatures ( @xmath29 very small ) one gets @xmath103 .    when the pulse is directed along the x - direction , the quasi - ferro mode is excited .",
    "the components of the magnetization different from zero are those along x- and y - axis .",
    "in particular we consider the magnetization along x - axis ( with respect to equilibrium ) , @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is defined as @xmath106 from the linearized dynamical equations this quantity is calculated as @xmath107",
    "using the procedure outlined in the previous section , all the parameters appearing in the dynamical equations ( [ e3],[e4 ] ) can be determined .",
    "these nonlinear equations are numerically integrated through a fifth - order runge - kutta algorithm .",
    "@xcite the experimental laser pulses along the z - axis are estimated to be equivalent to magnetic fields with an amplitude of 0.3 t and a full - width at half - maximum of about @xmath108 fs .",
    "@xcite therefore , we consider gaussian fields of the form given in eq.([e4a ] ) , with @xmath109 , @xmath110 fs and @xmath111 typically 3000 oe .",
    "this value of the effective field is small when compared with the exchange fields , so that effects due to the nonlinearity of the equations are negligible . since the time width of the pulse is small on the scale of the mode periods , the results are not strongly dependent on @xmath112 .",
    "the linear solution with a delta pulse represents a good approximation , provides the right orders of magnitude but does not reproduce exactly the numerical results .",
    "therefore , in all the following figures we plot the results obtained by the numerical integration .    in the first and second subsections we discuss the effects of a gaussian pulse along z and x directions , respectively , when the system at equilibrium is in the @xmath2 phase . in the final one we briefly analyze the resonance modes and magnetization dynamics if the @xmath3 phase is stable at low temperatures .      as illustrated in ref .",
    "12 , pulses along the z and -z directions excite the quasi - antiferro mode . using the numerical procedure discussed in the preceding section , we have calculated the oscillating behavior of the ferromagnetic vector along z focusing on @xmath113 at @xmath114 k. as shown in fig.2(a ) ,",
    "the magnetization has a sine - like behavior with weak damping on a picosecond scale .",
    "in addition , opposite fields give rise to out - of - phase oscillations in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "we notice that after 50 picoseconds the amplitude is about half of the initial one , a value that is compatible with results reported in fig.1 of ref.12 .",
    "this suggests that the damping term associated to magnon - magnon scattering provides a reasonable description of the reduction of the amplitude as a function of temperature .    comparing the experimental data shown in fig.1 of ref.12 with the theoretical results shown in fig.2(a ) of this paper",
    ", we point out similarities and differences . indeed , on the scale of the initial pulse width",
    ", there is a strong enhancement of the experimental faraday rotation , probably due to the interference between pump and probe pulses .",
    "after this transient the oscillations induced by pulses with opposite helicities show similar amplitudes in time .",
    "in contrast with theoretical results , the equilibrium point of the faraday rotations shows a decay and its behavior is different for left- and right - handed polarized pulses .",
    "only later the oscillations tend toward a common equilibrium point that is different , however , from that before the pulse excitation .",
    "if the shift of the equilibrium positions is caused by a change of the anisotropy constants due to an intrinsic photomagnetic effect , then the amplitude of the oscillations should be different for the two helicities , as reported in a recent experiment .",
    "@xcite since this is not the case in dysprosium orthoferrites , the change in the orientation equilibrium is more probably associated with a small but unavoidable laser - heating effect .",
    "actually , within the model proposed in this paper , a shift of the equilibrium configuration could in principle be caused by the magnetic pulse during the excitation .",
    "@xcite this shift is negligible , however , since the amplitude of the effective magnetic field is much smaller than the antisymmetrical exchange field @xmath13 . only by enhancing the amplitude of the pulse to values comparable to @xmath13 ,",
    "the shift becomes important , and , upon further increase , even a precessional switching can occur .",
    "these amplitudes imply very high light intensities that are probably above the damage threshold of the samples .    in fig .",
    "2(b ) we focus on the related quantity @xmath115 , defined as @xmath116 with @xmath117 and @xmath118 indicating positive and negative amplitudes , respectively .",
    "as reported in the experimental work , @xcite this quantity is less dependent on initial effects .",
    "just after the transient induced by the pulse , this quantity has an amplitude of the order of @xmath0 , in close agreement with the calculated data reported in fig .",
    "it is worthwhile understanding the order of magnitude of this amplitude by exploiting the result of the previous section for the delta pulse . from eq.([e14 ] ) we get for short times ( @xmath119 ) @xmath120 with @xmath101 given in eq.([e16d ] ) .",
    "the amplitude is determined by the term @xmath101 depending on the model parameters and by @xmath121 related to the pulse intensity . using the experimental data ,",
    "the impulse @xmath122 is estimated to be of the order of @xmath123 oe@xmath124fs .",
    "this implies that @xmath125 is of the same order as the angle @xmath31 responsible for the canted antiferromagnetism : @xmath126 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath127 if we consider @xmath103 , we obtain the order of magnitude @xmath128 not so far from the experiment . hence the ratio @xmath129 is fundamental not only for the equilibrium configuration , but also for the magnetization dynamics in the canted antiferromagnet .     of the magnetization along z - axis with respect to the equilibrium value in units of @xmath0 as a function of time for two opposite amplitudes .",

    "@xcite due to the fact that the equilibrium position corresponds to a maximum of @xmath131 , the temporal evolution of @xmath132 , with @xmath94 defined in eq.([e15a ] ) , is characterized by a very small amplitude . from eq.([e15 ] ) one can deduce that the amplitude of @xmath133 should be at least an order of magnitude smaller than that of @xmath134 .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the results of the numerical calculation for the quantity @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is defined in eq.([e16a ] ) .",
    "we point out that now the amplitude is an order of magnitude larger than that of @xmath134 and the response is more sensitive to the pulse .",
    "actually this is due to the fact that the dynamics of the components along the y - axis is strongly influenced by the highest energy scale @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite from eq.([e16 ] ) we obtain a rough estimate for short times ( @xmath119 ) @xmath137 therefore the amplitude is @xmath138 .",
    "finally , we notice that , after 50 picoseconds , the damping acts in the same way as for the ferromagnetic vector along the z - direction , causing a reduction of about half of the initial amplitude .",
    "-3 mm    in order to make contact to the experimental measurements , it is interesting to analyze the behavior of the magnetization dynamics at different temperatures . as reported in fig.3 of the paper by kimel _",
    "et al._,@xcite upon heating the sample , the frequency of the oscillations increases and the amplitude decreases .",
    "the oscillations have temperature - dependent frequencies that are very close to those measured by raman experiments at temperatures higher than 50 k. in fig.4 of this paper the calculated @xmath115 is shown .",
    "we find agreement with experimental decay of amplitudes and behavior of the frequency upon increasing the temperature for times after the transient . within the theoretical approach ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the anisotropy constants @xmath29 and @xmath30 affects the frequency of the modes , but is not so important in the change of the amplitude after the laser transient .",
    "the decrease of the magnetization seen at a fixed time ( of the order of tens of picoseconds ) for different temperatures is dominated by the increase of the damping constant @xmath50 in temperature . due to the agreement with experiment ,",
    "the estimate of the damping constant derived on the basis of the magnon - magnon scattering is reliable .",
    "the results of fig.4 show the magnetization normalized by the sublattice magnetization modulus @xmath7 .",
    "we point out that , in principle , @xmath7 can vary as function of temperature . however , the inclusion of the temperature dependence of @xmath139 ) is not easy , since only the magnetization @xmath140 is typically experimentally available . in any case , even if the angle @xmath31 is assumed fixed , the change of @xmath140 is small in the considered temperature range .",
    "@xcite    -3 mm    before closing this section , we focus on the dependence of the magnetic response on the amplitude of the pulse . as inferred by eq.([e18 ] ) , for the effective magnetic pulses used in the experiments , the ferromagnetic vector is proportional to @xmath122 , _",
    "i.e. _ , to the intensity of the light pulse used in the inverse faraday effect .",
    "in fig.5 we plot the numerical results for the amplitude of the magnetization at t=40 ps , _",
    "i.e. _ , after about 10 periods as in the experimental data .",
    "@xcite we find the expected linear behavior as a function of the amplitude of the pulse . the value obtained at 5 t for @xmath141 k is not far from unity .",
    "thus , the saturation of the magnetization along z is reached for this high intensity , in agreement with the extrapolation of the experimental data in the inset of fig.2 of ref.12 .",
    "-3 mm    summarizing , in this subsection we have focused on the magnetization dynamics in the @xmath2 phase when the field pulse is directed along the z - axis .",
    "we have analyzed the amplitude and the decay of the oscillations as a function of temperature finding agreement with experimental data for times longer than the initial transient .",
    "actually , on the time scale of the initial pulse width , discrepancies with experiments appear",
    ". these could be due to a small but unavoidable laser - heating effect that is not included in the present theoretical approach .      in this subsection",
    "we analyze the effects of the excitation due to the pulse along the x - axis .",
    "the fields along the x - direction excite another mode . as shown in eq.([e17 ] ) , @xmath105 oscillates with the frequency of the quasi - ferro mode in agreement with experiment . on the other hand , the magnitude of the magnetic response along x is of the same order as that obtained along the z - axis _ with a pulse of equal amplitude_. even if the torque exerted by the field along x is tiny , the subsequent temporal evolution , in particular , that of the variables @xmath52 and @xmath55 , is able to give a non - negligible amplitude to the response along @xmath142 .",
    "this is in discrepancy with the experimental results which show that the _ faraday rotation _ along x is at least an order of magnitude smaller than that along the z - axis .",
    "@xcite also , as shown in fig.3 of ref.12 , it does not show any temperature dependence following the behavior of the frequency of the quasi - ferro mode , in striking contrast with the case of a pulse along the z - axis .",
    "in order to properly compare the experimental and theoretical results , we should take into account several effects in orthoferrites .",
    "@xcite first of all , the experimental estimate of the effective magnetic field pulse due to the inverse faraday effect is available only when the pulse is along the z - axis .",
    "moreover , it is well known that in rare - earth orthoferrites optical birefringence is not negligible .",
    "@xcite therefore the experimental faraday rotations along the z- and x - axis can be different , even if the oscillations of the magnetizations are of the same order . since the faraday rotation along the x direction is very small in comparison with that along the z - axis , part of the effect could be also associated with the anisotropy of the magneto - optical susceptibility .",
    "indeed , the effective magnetic field generated via the inverse faraday effect can be different for the two orthogonal orientations .",
    "finally , there is another source of anisotropy : the field along the z - axis can show a renormalization of the coupling to the system that is different from that along the x - axis .    in order to elucidate this last point ,",
    "we have included in our model the anisotropy induced by the dysprosium ions . as a result , a modification of the coupling of the magnetic field to the iron ions takes place . according to a simple scheme proposed long ago by zvezdin and matveev , @xcite the coupling to the field along the z - direction is reduced by the factor @xmath143 ( see in fig.2(b ) the effect of this reduction ) .",
    "instead , the reduction @xmath144 of the coupling along the x - axis is temperature dependent and can be extracted by the measurements of magnetic properties .",
    "@xcite with temperature decreasing toward 50 k , these coupling factors can become a non - negligible source of anisotropy . as shown in fig .",
    "6 , the difference in the amplitudes for the response along the z- and x - axis can become relevant at those temperatures .",
    "however , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "6 , the ratio between the amplitudes along x and z axis increases with temperature up to an inversion point .",
    "therefore the source of the anisotropy associated only to dysprosium ions seems not to be effective for the interpretation of the experimental data .      in this last subsection",
    "we focus on the @xmath3 phase that is stable at low temperatures .",
    "the measurements reported in ref.12 show the maximum value of the amplitude of the magnetization between 20 and 50 k. moreover , the frequency of the photoinduced magnetization is constant in this temperature range at the value close to 50 k that is characteristic of the @xmath2 phase .",
    "therefore , the laser pulse is inducing excitation modes of the phase that should be unstable at low temperatures .    in order to stabilize the @xmath3 phase",
    ", the free energy ( [ e0 ] ) has to be supplemented with a quartic term , @xcite for instance , a term that decreases the energy when the moments are antiferromagnetically aligned along the y axis ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "we assume @xmath145 in order to describe the system in simple terms .",
    "upon linearization around the equilibrium configuration @xmath146 and @xmath147 , the two modes characteristic of this phase can be derived .",
    "the first one , with frequency @xmath148 corresponds to a dynamic with @xmath149 and @xmath150 , while the second mode , with frequency @xmath151 is characterized by @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "we follow the procedure of sec .",
    "ii : the anisotropy constants are derived by eqs.([e5f],[e6f ] ) and the experimental raman spectra @xcite by imposing @xmath154 . at t=50",
    "we find @xmath155 oe that is close to @xmath156 oe obtained if the @xmath2 phase is stable at that temperature .",
    "the values of @xmath157 required to stabilize the @xmath3 phase are small .",
    "the free energy corresponding to the equilibrium position of the @xmath3 phase is @xmath158 , while that of the @xmath2 phase is at first order in the canting angle @xmath31 @xmath159 the condition @xmath160 implies that @xmath161 taking into account the values of the exchange fields given in the previous section and the anisotropy constant @xmath162 , we derive @xmath163 oe . therefore the value of the constant @xmath157 is consistent with the expansion of the free energy being only a fraction of the anisotropy energies @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "if the parameter @xmath157 is of the order of hundreds of oersted , the phases @xmath2 and @xmath3 are close in energy . due to a small light absorption",
    ", the laser pulse could affect the stability of the system by favoring the @xmath2 phase on a short time scale .",
    "therefore the femtosecond pulse could induce a reorientational phase transition from @xmath3 to @xmath2 state in analogy with the antiferromagnetic - to - ferromagnetic phase transition induced by heating with a laser in ferh films .",
    "@xcite finally , we point out that a static magnetic field gives rise to a spin reorentational transition in orthoferrites . @xcite",
    "hence the role of the magnetic field pulse induced via the inverse faraday effect could be investigated in relation to the perturbation of the phase stability .",
    "this is left for future investigations .",
    "stimulated by recent experimental results showing ultrafast non - thermal control of magnetization by instantaneous photomagnetic pulses in dysprosium orthoferrites , a theoretical study of magnetization dynamics has been presented in this paper .",
    "we have employed a general form of free energy suitable for dysprosium orthoferrites whose parameters are derived from experimental measurements .",
    "we have solved coupled sublattice landau - lifshitz - gilbert equations whose damping parameter is determined by considering the scattering rate due to magnon - magnon interaction . due to the inverse faraday effect , the magnetic fields perturbing the equilibrium configuration can be modeled as gaussian pulses with amplitude proportional to the intensity of the light pulse and time width of the order of hundred femtoseconds .",
    "the non - linear dynamical equations have been integrated through an optimized runge - kutta algorithm and an analytical solution of the linearized system has been discussed in the case when the magnetic field pulse is assumed to have the shape of a delta function .",
    "this solution provides the right orders of magnitude allowing to interpret the experimental results in simple terms .",
    "we have found that the quasi - antiferro mode is excited by the pulse along the z - axis and the oscillations of the magnetization have amplitudes compatible with experiment .",
    "magnetic fields in opposite directions give rise to out - of - phase oscillations showing a behavior in agreement with experimental results for times longer than the initial transient .",
    "we have stressed that the magnetization dynamics is not only strongly influenced by the amplitude of the magnetic field pulse , but also by the parameters determining the free energy , in particular the ratio between the antisymmetric and symmetric exchange energies .",
    "the temperature dependence of the magnetization dynamics has been discussed showing that the proposed damping mechanism based on magnon - magnon scattering can be effective on the picosecond scale . when the field pulse is along the x - axis",
    ", the quasi - ferro mode is excited , but there are some discrepancies in the comparison between theory and data .",
    "we point out that the response along the x - axis can be strongly influenced in orthoferrites by several effects such as the optical birefringence and the anisotropy of the magneto - optical susceptibility .",
    "finally , the behavior of the magnetization has been analyzed in the low - temperature range where , due to an unavoidable heating effect , the laser pulse could perturb the stability between @xmath3 and @xmath2 state .",
    "we notice that the model proposed in this work has neglected dipolar contributions because they are orders of magnitude smaller than exchange and anisotropy terms .",
    "moreover , due to the fact that the effective magnetic field obtained through the inverse faraday effect shows spatial variations negligible on the microscopic scale , only the spin - wave modes at zero wave - vector are excited . since the static magnetization changes slowly in the investigated temperature range , the presence of spin - waves with wave - vectors different from zero should not provide sizable contributions to the dynamic behavior .",
    "therefore , the macrospin approximation employed in this paper can be considered reliable .    finally , we point out that the approach employed for dysprosium orthoferrites can be also generalized to describe the magnetization dynamics of other rare - earth orthoferrites , at least in the @xmath2 phase .",
    "the anisotropy constants are the only quantities strongly dependent on the rare - earth ion , but these do not play a major role in affecting statics and dynamics . on the other hand ,",
    "the most important values of the exchange fields are of the same order in several rare - earth orthoferrites .",
    "@xcite clearly the approach proposed in this paper is suitable for magnetic dielectrics and not for metallic itinerant magnets .",
    "however , up to now , due to the unavoidable light absorption , it has been impossible to ascertain the role played by the inverse faraday effect on the magnetization dynamics of itinerant magnets .",

    "we have checked that the circularly polarized magnetic field associated to the electromagnetic pulse with frequency corresponding to @xmath164 ev gives a contribution to the amplitude of the response that is at least four orders of magnitude less than that obtained when the inverse faraday effect is active ."
