    "we consider the production of the @xmath2 meson through the loop of the charged @xmath23 mesons , @xmath24 , see @xcite .",

    "the production amplitude @xmath25 in the rest frame of the @xmath12 meson is : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the polarization vectors of the @xmath12 meson and the photon respectively .",
    "the expressions for @xmath30 are obtained in the four - quark @xmath5 model @xcite and in the scalar @xmath3 molecule model @xcite .",

    "having done the integration over angle @xmath44 we get @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the energy of the photon .",
    "following we identify @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "we also introduce two symmetrical angle cuts : @xmath50 , where @xmath44 is the angle between the photon momentum and the electron beam in the center of mass frame of the reaction under consideration and @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the angle between the photon and the @xmath19 meson momenta in the dipion rest frame .    as it was shown in the previous papers the basic background to the process under study has came from the initial electron radiation ( see fig.1d ) and the radiation from the final pions ( fig.1c ) .",
    "the initial state radiation does not interfere with the final state radiation and with the signal in the differential cross section integrated over all angles since the charged pions are in the c=-1 state .",
    "this is true also when the angle cuts are symmetrical .    introducing the symmetrical angle cuts considerably decreases the background from the initial state radiation because of the photons in this case",
    "are emitted along the beams mainly .",
    "the restriction on the energy of photons @xmath53 cuts the background from the radiative process with the radiation of hard photons .",
    "in our region @xmath53 the background from the nonresonant by invariant mass of @xmath54 system processes , see fig.1e , is negligible .",

    "taking into account the vacuum polarization we get @xmath59 for simplicity sake , we restricted our expression only to the photon contribution which is the main in the @xmath57 transition , see fig.1f .",

    "the corrections related to the final state are proportional to @xmath74 and in the @xmath12 meson peak are small as compared with the initial state corrections which are proportional to @xmath75 .",
    "we take into account the corrections related with the initial state only .",
    "if to take into account that the initial state radiation is approximately twice the final state radiation at our angle cuts , see below , then we get that the radiative corrections to the final state radiation is about @xmath76 of the ones to the initial state radiation .",

    "guided by @xcite , we choose the angle cuts @xmath158 and @xmath159 , which decrease the initial state radiation by a factor of nine .",

    "as one can see from eq .",
    "( [ firo ] ) the contribution of the @xmath57 transition to the amplitude is about @xmath58 at @xmath161 .",

    "the observation is possible at the detectors cmd-2 and snd at the vepp-2 m collider .",
    "furthermore , the planed experimental statistics at the @xmath12-factories will let analyzing interference patterns to decide between two models of the @xmath2 meson makeup : @xmath168 model and the model of the @xmath3 molecule .    really , as one can see in fig.2 , in the case of @xmath168 model",
    "the difference between the constructive interference and the background at the @xmath12 meson point is @xmath169 , and for the destructive interference this difference is @xmath170 , at the total cross section @xmath18 is @xmath171 .",
    "as it is seen from fig.4 , for the model of the @xmath3 molecule the difference between the destructive interference and the background equals approximately to the difference between the background and the constructive one and is @xmath172 at the @xmath12 meson point .",
    "besides that , the comparison of two graphs shows that the behavior of the constructive interference in the @xmath168 case and in the case of the @xmath3 molecule differs fundamentally .",
    "in the @xmath168 case the constructive interference has a prominent peak while in the case of the @xmath3 molecule such a peak is absent .",
    "this behavior is easy to be distinguished experimentally since the difference of the cross sections is @xmath173 .    for the destructive interference",
    "the difference between two models is not so strong . in despite of the fact that the signal in the model of the scalar @xmath3 molecule is much weaker then in the @xmath168 model ( @xmath174 , see also , the cross section difference decreases not so much .",
    "the reason is that in the case of the destructive interference the interference term in the @xmath168 model is compensated by the modulus square of @xmath2 meson production amplitude meanwhile in the model of the @xmath3 molecule the interference term is dominant .",
    "the difference between the cross sections of the destructive interference case in the four - quark model and in the model of the @xmath3 molecule is about @xmath175 at the @xmath12 meson peak .    on the other hand",
    ", we have to note a quite week dependence of the interference pattern in the total cross section on the parameters of the models . to illustrate it we show the lines of the destructive interference for the different parameters of the models in fig.6 .    in the four - quark model for @xmath155 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , so that @xmath176 , @xmath177 , the visible width @xmath96 the curve is shown as a solid line .",
    "the dotted line is for @xmath155 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 , so that @xmath180 , @xmath181 and the visible width @xmath182 in the four - quark model .    the dashed line for @xmath155 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 that correspond the @xmath185 structure of the @xmath2 meson @xcite . at such parameters @xmath186 , @xmath187 and the visible width @xmath182 .    and also",
    "the curve without @xmath2 resonance ( the line 2 ) , we have for that @xmath188 , see appendix .    in despite of the fact that the values of the partial widths vary by two orders the total interference pattern changes not so dramatically",
    ".    in parallel with the interference pattern in the total cross section one should consider the interference pattern in the photon spectrum which for the visible width @xmath96 has a good sensitivity since it is a differential characteristic , see fig.3 and fig.5 .",
    "the concurrent observation of two interference patterns , by the energy of beam and by the energy of the photon , extends the possibility for analysis and allows to have more strong limits . along with it , for the broad @xmath2 meson ( the visible width @xmath182 ) the interference pattern in the photon spectrum is less informative .",
    "in the case of an experimental difficulties to distinguish the charged pions from muons the detected events @xmath18 contain the part of the events from the reaction @xmath20 , @xcite .",

    "<S> we consider the reaction @xmath18 and give the necessary formulae for this process with taking into account the cuts of the angle between the photon momentum and electron beam and of the angle between the photon and @xmath19 meson momenta in the dipion rest frame . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the radiative corrections to the full cross section of the process in that section as well . </S>",
    "<S> the propagators and model depending quantities are described in the section iii . </S>",
    "<S> the section iv is devoted to the interference pattern in the spectrum of the photon energy at the @xmath12 meson peak and the interference pattern in the full cross section by the total energy of the beams at the @xmath12 meson region . in the conclusion </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the possibility of experimental investigation of interference patterns in the reaction @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the appendix gives the expressions for the cross section of the @xmath20 process which is the background for the @xmath18 reaction and gives the values for @xmath21 and @xmath22 as well . </S>"
