    "the present article is a natural continuation of the works @xcite where solutions of the schrdinger , klein - gordon , and dirac equations in the superposition of the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) field ( the field of an infinitely long and infinitesimally thin solenoid ) and a collinear uniform magnetic field were studied . in what follows ,",
    "we call the latter superposition the magnetic - solenoid field . in particular , in the paper @xcite solutions of the dirac equation in the magnetic - solenoid field in @xmath0 and @xmath1 dimensions",
    "were studied in detail .",
    "then , in @xcite , these solutions were used to calculate various characteristics of the particle radiation in such a field .",
    "in fact , the ab effect in synchrotron radiation was investigated . however ,",
    "a number of important and interesting aspects related to the rigorous treatment of the solutions of the dirac equation in the magnetic - solenoid field were not considered .",
    "one ought to say that in the work @xcite it was pointed out that a critical subspace exists where the hamiltonian of the problem is not self - adjoint .",
    "but the corresponding self - adjoint extensions of the hamiltonian were not studied .",
    "the completeness of the solutions was not considered from this point of view as well .",
    "one has to remark that even for the pure ab field it was not simple to solve the two aforementioned problems .",
    "first , the construction of self - adjoint extensions of the nonrelativistic hamiltonian in the ab field was studied in detail in @xcite . in the work @xcite solutions in the regularized ab field",
    "were thoroughly considered as well .",
    "the need to consider self - adjoint extensions of the dirac hamiltonian in the pure ab field in @xmath2 dimensions was recognized in @xcite .",
    "the interaction between the magnetic momentum of a charged particle and the ab field essentially changes the behavior of the wave functions at the magnetic string @xcite .",
    "it was shown that a one - parameter family of boundary conditions at the origin arises .",
    "self - adjoint extensions of the dirac hamiltonian in @xmath1 dimensions were found in @xcite .",
    "the works @xcite present an alternative method of treating the hamiltonian extension problem in @xmath0 and in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in @xmath0 dimensions only two values of the extension parameter correspond to the presence of the point - like magnetic field at the origin .",
    "thus , other values of the parameter correspond to additional contact interactions .",
    "one possible boundary condition was obtained in @xcite by a specific regularization of the dirac delta function , starting from a model in which the continuity of both components of the dirac spinor is imposed at a finite radius , and then this radius is shrunk to zero .",
    "other extensions in @xmath0 and @xmath1 dimensions were constructed in the works @xcite by imposing spectral boundary conditions of the atiyah - patodi - singer type @xcite ( mit boundary conditions ) at a finite radius , and then the zero - radius limit is taken . in the works",
    "@xcite it was shown that , given certain relations between the extension parameters , it is possible to find the most general domain where the hamiltonian and the helicity operator are self - adjoint .",
    "the bound state problem for particles with magnetic moment in the ab potential was considered in detail in the works @xcite .",
    "the physically motivated boundary conditions for the particle scattering on the ab field and a coulomb center was studied in @xcite .",
    "the study of similar problems in the magnetic - solenoid field is a nontrivial task .",
    "indeed , the presence of the uniform magnetic field changes the energy spectrum of the spinning particle from continuous to discrete .",
    "thus , the boundary conditions that were obtained for a continuous spectrum can not be automatically used for the discrete spectrum . by analogy with the pure ab field",
    "it is important to consider the regularized magnetic - solenoid field ( we call the regularized magnetic - solenoid field the superposition of a uniform magnetic field and the regularized ab field ) .",
    "here one has to study solutions of the dirac equation in such a field .",
    "the latter problem was not solved before , and is of particular interest regardless of the extension problem in the ab field .",
    "one ought to say that the pauli equation in the magnetic - solenoid field was recently studied in @xcite .    in the present article we consider the dirac equation in the general magnetic - solenoid field ( the uniform magnetic field and the ab field may have both the same and opposite directions ) and in the regularized magnetic - solenoid field .",
    "first we construct self - adjoint extensions of the dirac hamiltonian using von neumann s theory of deficiency indices .",
    "we demonstrate how to reduce the @xmath3-dimensional problem to the @xmath4-dimensional one by a proper choice of the spin operator .",
    "we find self - adjoint extensions of the dirac hamiltonian in both above dimensions and boundary conditions at the ab solenoid .",
    "then , we study properties of the corresponding solutions and energy spectra .",
    "we discuss the spectrum dependence upon the extension parameter . in the regularized magnetic - solenoid field , we find for the first time solutions of the dirac equation .",
    "we study the structure of these solutions and their dependence on the behavior of the magnetic field inside the solenoid .",
    "then we use these solutions to specify boundary conditions for the singular magnetic - solenoid field . to this end",
    ", we consider the zero - radius limit of the solenoid .",
