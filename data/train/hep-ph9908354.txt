    "field - theoretic calculations of bound - state properties , such as those one would like to do for quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , require regularization of infinities and renormalization of parameters . as a way of providing a systematic regularization of ultraviolet infinities we study @xcite the use of pauli  villars ( pv ) regularization @xcite in the context of discrete light - cone quantization ( dlcq ) @xcite .",
    "renormalization is accomplished by adjusting bare parameters to fit selected state properties with `` data . ''",
    "the problem to be solved is then a bound - state eigenvalue problem , which includes pv constituents , combined with renormalization conditions .",
    "the couplings of the pv constituents are chosen to produce desired cancellations in perturbation theory .",
    "we have tested these ideas for two related ( 3 + 1)-dimensional hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "the first @xcite was constructed to have an analytic solution , in analogy with the equal - time model of greenberg and schweber @xcite .",
    "the second hamiltonian @xcite is a generalization of the first which assigns proper light - cone energies to all particles , but does not have an analytic solution .",
    "both hamiltonians are distantly related to yukawa theory , in that a fermion field acts as a source and sink for bosons .",
    "the second hamiltonian and some of the results obtained will be described here .",
    "work on direct application to yukawa theory is in progress .",
    "the choice of light - cone coordinates ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) @xcite is driven by important advantages , which include kinematical boosts , a simple vacuum , and well - defined fock - state expansions with no disconnected pieces .",

    "when momenta are discretized @xcite this positivity brings the additional advantage of a finite limit on the number of constituents .",

    "the simultaneous solution is done by iterative means .    once the wave functions @xmath21 have been obtained",
    ", they can be used to compute various quantities , such as the boson structure function @xmath29 and the average boson multiplicity and momentum @xmath30 we also compute the slope of the fermion `` charge '' form factor @xmath31 , from an expression derived in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the coupled equations ( [ eq : coupledeqns ] ) are converted to a finite matrix eigenvalue problem by applying the dlcq procedure @xcite .",

    "bosons are assigned periodic boundary conditions and the fermion is assigned an antiperiodic boundary condition in the longitudinal direction .",
    "the momentum integer @xmath38 is then even for bosons and odd for the fermion .    the total longitudinal momentum @xmath5 of the dressed fermion defines an odd integer @xmath39 , called the harmonic resolution @xcite .",
    "a longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath40 then reduces to a rational number @xmath41 .",

    "the transverse scale @xmath37 is computed from these as @xmath49 .",
    "the longitudinal scale does not appear @xcite , but the limit @xmath50 is equivalent to @xmath51 .",
    "we therefore study the limit where @xmath48 , @xmath47 , and @xmath33 all become large .",
    "this recovers the continuum form of the theory , which is regulated by the pv mass @xmath13 , not by @xmath52 .",
    "we must then also study the large @xmath13 limit .",
    "typical discretizations , such as @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , with @xmath56 produce matrices with ranks on the order of 5 million . the largest calculations carried out were of rank 10.5 million , which required approximately 2 hours of cpu time on a single 4-processor node of an ibm sp .",
    "the diagonalization method used is the lanczos algorithm for complex symmetric matrices @xcite .",
    "although the automatic truncation of particle number imposed by dlcq can be sufficient , further truncation can be made when the coupling is weak .",
    "such truncation , typically to 4 bosons , was used to permit increased resolution within fixed memory limits .",
    "the validity of such an approximation was checked by computing the contribution of individual fock sectors to the total norm .",
