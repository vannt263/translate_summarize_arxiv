    "it is currently established that circumstellar disks are quite ubiquitous around young stellar objects of all masses ( muzerolle 2003 ; cesaroni 2007 ) .",
    "they represent an important ingredient of the star formation since initially protostars must be growing predominantly by accretion through the disk : angular momentum conservation forces the infalling protostellar cloud material to form a centrifugally supported disk which then accretes onto a star .",
    "it is quite likely that only a small fraction of the final stellar mass gets acquired by the direct infall onto the protostellar surface , so that almost all of the stellar mass gets processed through the disk .",
    "this picture of star formation implies very high initial mass accretion rates in the disk , at the level of @xmath0 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 as the solar - type stars are thought to gain most of their mass during the first several @xmath3 yr .",
    "the presence of such a high-@xmath4 accretion flow just outside the protostar immediately raises an issue of its possible effect on the protostellar properties .",
    "there are several ways in which disk accretion affects the protostar .",
    "first , star gains mass from the disk which increases its binding energy and tends to make the star more compact .",
    "second , accreting gas brings in some amount of thermal energy with it which contributes to the pressure support in the star .",
    "the exact amount of heat advected into the star with the accreted material is unknown but it seems likely that because of the disk geometry the accreted gas would have enough time to radiate away most of its thermal energy and would join the convective interior of the star with temperature much smaller than the stellar virial temperature .",
    "third , intense energy dissipation taking place in the innermost parts of the accretion disk leads to strong irradiation of the stellar surface by the disk ( frank & shu 1986 ; popham 1997 ) .",
    "it has been recently realized ( rafikov 2007 ) that irradiation can act to suppress the internal luminosity of the protostar similar to the suppression of the cooling of hot jupiters by the radiation of their parent stars ( guillot 1996 ; burrows 2000 ; baraffe 2003 ; chabrier 2004 ) .",
    "disk accretion at rates @xmath5 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 can easily reduce internal stellar luminosity by a factor of several which may have important implications for the early stellar evolution .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to assess these implications by following the evolution of accreting protostar properly taking into account effects of disk irradiation .",
    "we consider a protostar of mass @xmath6 and radius @xmath7 growing by accretion of gas at rate @xmath4 from the circumstellar disk . in this work @xmath4",
    "is specified as an explicit function of time so that @xmath8 is also known .",
    "we assume the disk to extend all the way to the stellar surface as even a @xmath9 kg magnetic field ( typical value measured in the mature t tauri systems , see bouvier 2007 ) would not be able to truncate the disk accreting at a high rate of @xmath5 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 . at the stellar surface accreting gas passes through the boundary layer ( popham 1993 ) in which its speed is reduced from the keplerian velocity to the velocity of the stellar surface .    to evaluate the effect of disk irradiation on the protostellar evolution we use an approach based on the energy conservation which was developed in hartmann ( 1997 ) .",
    "in this approach the convective part of the star comprising most of its mass is assumed to behave like a polytrope with index @xmath10 , so that inside the star pressure @xmath11 is related to the density @xmath12 via @xmath13 .",
    "this approximation works very well in highly ionized , dense , and fully convective interiors of young stars .",
    "the total energy of such a star ( a sum of its thermal and gravitational energies ) is @xmath14 ( kippenhahn & weigert 1994 ) .",
    "evolution of protostellar properties  luminosity @xmath15 ,",
    "radius @xmath7  as a function of time [ or , equivalently , stellar mass @xmath8 ] is then governed by the following equation : ( -)= -+e_th+l_d - l .",
    "[ eq : energy_eq ] the l.h.s . of this equation represents the change in the total stellar energy , the first and second terms in the r.h.s .",
    "are the gravitational potential energy and the thermal energy brought in with the accreted material , while @xmath17 is a deuterium luminosity of a protostar .",
    "stellar luminosity @xmath15 is the luminosity carried towards the photosphere by the convective motions in the stellar interior .",
    "it is different from the integrated emissivity of the stellar surface since the star also intercepts and reradiates a fraction of energy released in the accretion disk .",
    "rate at which thermal energy gets accreted by the star is e_th== , where @xmath18 is the ratio of specific heats of accreted gas ( which can be different from @xmath19 characteristic for the stellar interior ) , @xmath20 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the mean molecular weight and the temperature of the accreted gas .",
    "dimensionless parameter @xmath23 can be written as = ,  t_vir , [ eq : alpha ] where @xmath24 is the stellar virial temperature .",
    "gas accreting from the disk experiences strong dissipation in the boundary layer near the stellar surface . in this layer gas temperature can become an appreciable fraction of @xmath24 .",
    "however , the cooling time in the boundary layer and the outermost layers of the star is very short so that the accreted gas cools efficiently and should ultimately join stellar interior with temperature @xmath22 which is much lower than @xmath24 [ unless @xmath4 is extremely high , in excess of @xmath25 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 , see popham ( 1997 ) ] .",
    "thus , under the conditions considered in this work one expect @xmath26 but the actual value of this parameter is rather poorly constrained ( it depends on the gas thermodynamics , radiative transport , and the viscosity prescription in the boundary layer which are poorly constrained ) .",
    "as here we are primarily interested in the effects of disk irradiation we set @xmath27 for simplicity on the protostellar evolution . ] . in this case equation ( [ eq : energy_eq ] ) can be rewritten as = ( l_d - l)- .",
    "[ eq : master ] this is an evolution equation for @xmath7 and can be easily integrated numerically once the dependencies of @xmath28 and @xmath15 on stellar parameters are known .    for @xmath28",
    "we adopt the expression obtained in stahler ( 1998 ) by integrating the rate of energy release due to d burning within the @xmath10 polytrope : l_d = f_d[d / h]l_d,0()^13.8 ( ) ^-14.8 , [ eq : l_d ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the fractional d abundance relative to the initial d number abundance [ d / h ] taken to be @xmath31 .",
    "parameter @xmath30 is not constant in time ",
    "it evolves since d burns in the stellar interior while the new d is being brought in with the accreting material ( with the initial abundance [ d / h ] ) . as a result ,",
    "one finds ( stahler 1988 ; hartmann 1997 ) ( f_dm)=m- , [ eq : f ] where @xmath32 ergs g@xmath2 is the energy released by d fusion per gram of stellar material ( assuming [ d / h]@xmath33 ) .    the most important aspect of this work which distinguishes it from hartmann ( 1997 ) is the calculation of @xmath15 . in the approximation adopted by hartmann ( 1997 )",
    "@xmath15 is a function of @xmath7 and @xmath6 only . in our case situation",
    "is different : irradiation of the stellar surface gives rise to an outer convectively stable layer below the stellar photosphere ( rafikov 2007 ) , similar to the radiative layer that form in the atmospheres of the close - in giant planets irradiated by their parent stars ( guillot 1996 ; burrows 2000 ) .",
    "this external radiative zone suppresses the local radiative flux coming from stellar interior and this changes the integrated stellar luminosity , which becomes a function of irradiation intensity . as a result , in irradiated case @xmath15",
    "depends not only on @xmath7 and @xmath6 but also on @xmath4 ( which determines the strength of the irradiation flux ) .",
    "rafikov ( 2007 ) has demonstrated that for a given opacity behavior at the stellar surface ( parametrized in his case to be a power - law function of gas pressure @xmath11 and temperature @xmath22 , @xmath34 ) the degree of luminosity suppression depends only on the so - called irradiation parameter l = l_0 ( ) ,  4 , [ eq : lambda ] which is ( up to a constant factor ) the ratio of the accretion luminosity of the disk @xmath35 to the luminosity @xmath36 that a star would have had in the absence of irradiation .",
    "suppression factor @xmath37 as @xmath38 while @xmath39 when @xmath40 . in a simple case considered by rafikov ( 2007 )",
    "the dependence of @xmath41 on the opacity behavior comes only through the parameter must be fulfilled , see rafikov ( 2007 ) for details . ]",
    "= + ( 1+)/_ad , [ eq : xi ] where @xmath42 is the adiabatic temperature gradient near the stellar surface .    in the strongly irradiated case",
    "the temperature of the stellar surface varies as a function of latitude : equatorial belt is strongly heated by the hot inner parts of the disk while the polar regions of the star are virtually unaffected by irradiation and preserve their temperature at the level of @xmath43 .",
    "in this situation one may wonder whether it is reasonable to assume a fixed opacity law ( as was done in rafikov 2007 ) for the calculation of luminosity suppression given that the behavior of @xmath44 can be different between the polar and the equatorial regions of the star .",
    "however , is was shown in rafikov ( 2007 ) that for the opacity behavior typical for stellar photospheres in the temperature interval from @xmath45 k to @xmath46 k the cooling of irradiated stars occurs mainly through their polar caps ( even though the opacity scaling with temperature and pressure changes quite drastically within this temperature interval at around @xmath47 k ) . as a result ,",
    "no matter how hot the equatorial parts of the star become and how complicated the opacity behavior is in this portion of the stellar surface , the integrated stellar luminosity @xmath15 does not depend on these details very strongly but is rather determined by the properties of the polar regions of the star : the size of the cool polar caps in which the photospheric temperature is preserved at the level of @xmath48 , and the opacity behavior in the adjacent parts of the stellar surface .",
    "this provides motivation for using the stellar luminosity prescription represented by equation ( [ eq : lambda ] ) . in this paper",
    "we adopt @xmath44 characteristic for the temperature interval @xmath49 k @xmath50 k ( bell & lin 1994 ) : 610 ^ -14p^2/3t^7/3 .",
    "[ eq : opacity ] this scaling should be reasonable in the polar regions of irradiated stars where the photospheric temperature @xmath48 is not strongly affected by irradiation and is close to the photospheric temperature that an isolated non - accreting star would have possessed in the hayashi phase .",
    "the opacity law ( [ eq : opacity ] ) corresponds to @xmath51 , assuming @xmath52 as appropriate for the fully ionized stellar interior ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "having specified the opacity law we have thus fully determined the behavior of @xmath53 ( which we take from rafikov [ 2007 ] , see the curve corresponding to @xmath51 in fig .",
    "4 of that paper ) necessary to compute @xmath15 .",
    "one remaining ingredient of the calculation is the choice of @xmath54  the luminosity of a non - irradiated star .",
    "hartmann ( 1997 ) have adopted the following fit to the stellar evolution tracks of dantona & mazzitelli ( 1994 ) : l_0(m , r)=1   l _ ( ) ^0.9 ( ) ^2.34 .",
    "[ eq : l_0 ] evolution tracks in dantona & mazzitelli ( 1994 ) have been calculated using the equation of state from magni & mazzitelli ( 1979 ) that has been superceded by the more refined treatments ( saumon 1995 ) .",
    "also , dantona & mazzitelli s treatment of convection is based on canuto & mazzitelli ( 1991 ) which has previously raised some concerns ( demarque 1999 ; nordlund & stein 1999 ) . despite these deficiencies ,",
    "we have chosen to adopt the prescription ( [ eq : l_0 ] ) in our work because of its simplicity since our primary goal is to evaluate the importance of disk irradiation . ] and also to allow direct comparison with the results of hartmann ( 1997 ) .    equations ( [ eq : master ] ) , ( [ eq : l_d ] ) , ( [ eq : f ] ) , ( [ eq : lambda ] ) , & ( [ eq : l_0 ] ) supplemented with @xmath55 and the dependence @xmath53 from rafikov ( 2007 ) fully determine the evolution of an accreting protostar irradiated by its own disk .",
    "this system of equations is then evolved numerically assuming that the prescription for @xmath56 is given .",
    "here we present the results of our calculations . as initial conditions we choose @xmath57 m@xmath1 and @xmath58 .",
    "we vary @xmath7 and the prescription for @xmath56 to see their effect on the evolution of stellar properties .    in figure",
    "[ fig : f1 ] we display protostellar evolution for initial @xmath59 r@xmath1 and a uniform @xmath60 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 with and without the effects of disk irradiation included .",
    "one can see that in both irradiated and non - irradiated cases evolution is pretty much the same : star initially contracts until its central density and temperature become high enough for the deuterium to ignite . right after that d burning strongly dominates over the stellar luminosity and d",
    "abundance @xmath30 starts going down .",
    "resulting energy release in the stellar interior causes star to expand out to @xmath61 r@xmath1 and d luminosity @xmath28 decreases appreciably ( but still exceeds @xmath36 by a factor of several ) .",
    "these results are in full agreement with the calculations of hartmann ( 1997 ) .    in the top two panels of figure [ fig : f1 ]",
    "we show quantities unique for the irradiated case : run of the irradiation parameter @xmath62 and the suppression factor @xmath53 .",
    "as @xmath7 initially decreases @xmath62 goes up to @xmath63 since @xmath64 for @xmath36 given by equation ( [ eq : l_0 ] ) . as a result",
    ", the internal stellar luminosity is appreciably suppressed and @xmath41 reaches @xmath65 demonstrating the importance of disk irradiation in regulating @xmath15 .    at the same time , although the effect of irradiation on @xmath15 is of order unity , figure [ fig : f1 ] clearly demonstrates that irradiation affects other stellar properties such as @xmath7 and @xmath30 only very weakly .",
    "as expected , @xmath7 in irradiated case is larger than in the non - irradiated case ( because @xmath15 suppression allows more heat to be retained inside the star ) but only by several per cent .    to check that this result is not an artefact of our initial conditions and assumed @xmath4 we have additionally calculated protostellar evolution for uniform @xmath66 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 and @xmath67 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 and different initial @xmath7 . results are presented in figures [ fig : f2 ] and [ fig : f3 ] in which we display the evolution of @xmath68 , where @xmath7 and @xmath69 are the values of the protostellar radius with and without disk irradiation taken into account .",
    "it is quite clear from these plots that despite the rather severe luminosity suppression ( @xmath41 reaching @xmath70 in the high @xmath4 case for the initial @xmath71 r@xmath1 ) the relative stellar radius increase due to irradiation is always rather small .",
    "note that at @xmath72 m@xmath1 we find @xmath73 when @xmath67 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 ( figure [ fig : f2 ] ) which is larger than in the higher @xmath4 case shown in figure [ fig : f3 ] ( when @xmath74 ) .",
    "very similar outcome has been found in the case of non - uniform @xmath4 : in figure [ fig : f4 ] we plot @xmath75 for different initial @xmath7 and @xmath76 with @xmath77 chosen in such a way that a protostar grows to @xmath9 m@xmath1 in @xmath3 yr .",
    "this growth time is close to the time needed to reach @xmath9 m@xmath1 in the case of constant @xmath67 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 , see figure [ fig : f3 ] . for non - uniform @xmath78",
    "one again finds that irradiated protostar differs in radius from the non - irradiated star by only a few per cent ( @xmath74 at @xmath72 m@xmath1 ) .",
    "it is also obvious from the comparison of figures [ fig : f3]c and [ fig : f4]c that roughly the same growth time translates into very similar behavior of @xmath75 in the two cases independent of how @xmath56 evolves .",
    "we thus conclude that irradiation by the circumstellar accretion disk has rather small effect on the protostellar evolution and that this outcome is rather generic .",
    "weak sensitivity of @xmath7 to disk irradiation given the strong effect that irradiation has on the internal luminosity @xmath15 of a protostar may seem surprising . however , one should bear in mind that besides @xmath15 there are other contributors to the stellar energy budget , namely the d burning luminosity @xmath28 and the gravitational potential energy gained with the accreted material .",
    "it turns out that these contributions dominate the energy budget over @xmath15 .    to see this we rewrite equation ( [ eq : master ] ) using definition ( [ eq : lambda ] ) in the following form : = ^-1 .",
    "[ eq : rewr_master ] in the right - hand side of this equation the first term in brackets describes the relative role of @xmath79 burning in the total energy budget , second term represents intrinsic stellar luminosity , while the third term is due to the inflow of the gravitational potential energy @xmath35  the ratio of this energy inflow to @xmath36 differs from @xmath62 only by a constant factor .",
    "suppression of @xmath15 is largest when @xmath62 is highest which is easy to see by inspecting figures [ fig : f1]-[fig : f4 ] .",
    "but this automatically means that the maximum deviation of the suppression factor @xmath41 from unity occurs precisely when the inflow of the gravitational potential energy far exceeds the stellar luminosity .",
    "apparently , under these circumstances @xmath15 is a subdominant contribution to the stellar energy budget and thus even a significant reduction of @xmath15 compared to @xmath36 is going to be negligible compared to the gravitational energy influx",
    ".    moreover , figure [ fig : f1 ] demonstrates that @xmath62 reaches its maximum when @xmath7 is at its minimum while @xmath30 is still very close to unity . at this point",
    "vigorous d burning commences inside the star giving rise to very high @xmath80 . as a result , at the evolutionary stage when @xmath41 is",
    "minimal @xmath15 is subdominant in comparison to not only @xmath35 but also @xmath28 .",
    "this additionally downplays the role of the luminosity suppression by irradiation in the early protostellar evolution .",
    "this line of reasoning also explains why at @xmath81 m@xmath1 we have found @xmath75 to be larger for lower @xmath4 ( see  [ sect : res ] ) .",
    "first , smaller @xmath4 means lower @xmath62 so that the ratio of @xmath15 to the gravitational energy inflow rate @xmath35 in the low @xmath4 case is larger than in the high @xmath4 case",
    ". also , at @xmath72 m@xmath1 one generally finds @xmath82 ( see figure [ fig : f1]e ) so that @xmath28 is mainly due to the burning of the freshly accreted d ( rather than the d that remained in the protostar from previous accretion ) . since in the low @xmath4 case less fresh @xmath79 is supplied to the protostar @xmath28 must also be lower than in the high @xmath4 case . as a result ,",
    "in the lower @xmath4 case @xmath15 plays a more significant role compared to @xmath28 ( in which case @xmath75 should be more sensitive to changes in @xmath15 caused by irradiation ) than in the high @xmath4 case .",
    "this conclusion immediately raises the following question : since @xmath75 increases as @xmath4 decreases would one find @xmath83 at low enough @xmath4 ?",
    "the answer is no , and it has to do with the fact that @xmath41 appreciably differs from unity ( obviously , a necessary condition for getting @xmath83 ) only at rather high @xmath62 .",
    "this is a generic feature of disk irradiation which is illustrated in figure [ fig : f5 ] where we display @xmath84  the value of @xmath62 at which @xmath85  as a function of assumed opacity law represented by the parameter @xmath86 , see equation ( [ eq : xi ] ) .",
    "one can see that @xmath87 for all @xmath88 , meaning that significant luminosity suppression requires rather high @xmath4 .",
    "this inefficiency of irradiation in suppressing @xmath15 is caused by the specific geometry of disk irradiation in which the irradiation flux is a very sensitive function ( @xmath89 ) of the latitude at the stellar surface @xmath90 , see rafikov ( 2007 ) . because of that stellar polar caps can stay cool even at rather high @xmath4 allowing unsuppressed flux to be emitted over a significant portion of the stellar surface .    in the case of @xmath51 as appropriate for cool , low - mass protostars",
    "one finds that @xmath91 which according to equation ( [ eq : lambda ] ) immediately implies that @xmath92 when @xmath93 . clearly , in this case stellar luminosity should have small effect on the protostellar evolution .",
    "if @xmath4 is reduced ( @xmath94 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 ) protostellar magnetic field is likely to disrupt accretion flow ( knigl 1991 ) thus invalidating our assumption of the direct disk accretion onto the star .",
    "] so that @xmath95 ( and @xmath96 ) stellar luminosity would be playing a significant role in the stellar energy budget , however @xmath41 would be very close to unity ( see rafikov 2007 ) and the @xmath15 suppression by irradiation would be negligible .",
    "thus , under no circumstances should one expect @xmath75 larger than several per cent , meaning that quite generally the irradiation by accretion disk is unlikely to play a significant role in the evolution of the protostellar properties .",
    "looking at this conclusion under slightly different angle , our results also imply that when considering evolution of the protostars accreting at @xmath97 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 one may completely neglect @xmath15 in the stellar energy budget and still get rather decent description of the protostellar evolution .",
    "our results are obtained assuming a specific value of @xmath86 typical for the low - mass stars .",
    "however , one expects our major conclusions to remain valid also in the case of other accreting objects such as young brown dwarfs and giant planets .",
    "although these objects are likely to be characterized by values of @xmath86 different from @xmath98 , our figure [ fig : f5 ] clearly demonstrates that the efficient suppression of stellar luminosity requires very large @xmath62 for _ any _ value of @xmath86 . as a result",

    "we considered evolution of the properties of a growing protostar accreting gas from the circumstellar disk with the goal of assessing the impact of irradiation by the inner regions of the disk .",
