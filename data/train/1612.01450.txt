    "among the many propulsions behind scientific progress , one stands out for its magnificent , yet intangible force - human creativity  @xcite . while the building blocks of innovations are often embedded in existing knowledge , it is creativity that blends seemingly disparate concepts , ideas and theories  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "even a theory as revolutionary as einstein s special relativity essentially reconciles newtonian mechanics and maxwell s electromagnetic theory .",
    "since plato s time  @xcite , numerous studies in psychology , cognitive science and philosophy have offered a plethora of theories to explain human creativity  @xcite . despite their importance ,",
    "today we still lack quantitative understanding of such phenomena .",
    "thanks to prolific scientific publication archives ( e.g. , , , ) , we are now equipped with the lens to study creativity in _ scientific enterprise _ with unprecedented precision .",
    "existing studies have focused on quantitatively gauging scientific papers creativity by investigating their citation relationships  @xcite .",
    "these studies offer convincing evidences that a paper s creativity is measurable by examining how it blends originally disconnected knowledge . yet ,",
    "little is known hitherto about the underlying mechanism governing this creative process .",
    "this work represents an initial step towards fine - grained understanding of creativity in scientific enterprise .",
    "we argue that , to understand the mechanism underlying scientific creative processes , solely relying on papers citation relationships is insufficient .",
    "after all , a paper s references , at best , only partially reflect its authors actual information consumption behaviors .",
    "first , the references may not include the most critical literature .",
    "second , the references may not provide a holistic view of all the literature inspiring the authors .",
    "finally , to understand the correlation between information consumption and knowledge production , it is imperative to characterize their temporal dynamics ; however , the references alone do not indicate when the cited literature were actually consumed by the authors .",
    "all these limitations highlight a fundamental gap between reality and perception in current studies .",
    "we overcome these limitations by directly contrasting authors information consumption behaviors with their knowledge products . in specific , using two web - scale , longitudinal datasets , microsoft academic graph ( 120.1 million papers across all scientific fields ) and indiana university click ( 53.5 billion web requests spanning over 4 years ) , we conduct a systematic study on creative processes in scientific enterprise .",
    "even though varied privacy and technology constraints preclude the possibility of tracking information consumption and knowledge production at an individual level , by studying their correlation at an organization level , we find remarkable predictability in scientific creative processes : of 59.0% papers across all scientific fields , 25.7% of their creativity can be readily explained by information consumed by their potential authors .",
    "moreover , leveraging these findings , we develop a predictive framework that captures the impact of authors information consumption over their future knowledge products . using the aforementioned datasets as an exemplary case",
    ", we demonstrate that our framework is able to accurately identify the most critical knowledge to fostering target scientific innovations .    to our best knowledge , this work is among the first to study scientific creative processes within the context of information consumption .",
    "we believe that the proposed creativity metrics , in synergy with existing measures ( e.g. , citation counts ) , lead to more comprehensive understanding of scientific publications merits .",
    "we also believe that our framework is of fundamental importance to the study of human creativity in general .",
    "foreseeably , it promotes strategies to stimulate and potentially automate creative processes , and provides significant insights towards more effective designs of information recommendation platforms .    the remainder of the paper proceeds as follows . ",
    "[ sec : literature ] surveys relevant literature ;  [ sec : data ] describes the datasets used in our study ;  [ sec : measurement ] presents a general creativity definition that subsumes existing ones ;  [ sec : explanation ] explores the predictability in scientific creative processes within the context of information consumption ;  [ sec : model ] details our prediction framework and develops efficient optimization algorithms ;  [ sec : measurement ] ,   [ sec : explanation ] and   [ sec : model ] all conclude with empirical studies of the proposed models and algorithms ; the paper is summarized in   [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we review four categories of related work : assessment of creativity , scientific impact prediction , map of science , and computational creativity .    despite numerous qualitative studies on creativity pertaining to various disciplines : psychology , cognitive science , economics and philosophy  @xcite ,",
    "it is only after the proliferation of scientific publication archives that it is feasible to quantitatively study creativity in scientific enterprise .",
    "one active line of inquiry is to develop meaningful creativity metrics .",
    "uzzi et al .",
    "@xcite proposed to measure a paper s creativity as atypical pairwise combinations of its referenced work ; fleming  @xcite proposed to gauge a patent s novelty using new combinations of patents in its references .",
    "this line of work offers convincing evidence that scientific work s creativity is measurable by investigating how it blends originally disconnected knowledge .",
    "however , little is known hitherto about the mechanism that triggers such connections . to our best knowledge , this work is among the first to directly bridge this gap by studying creativity within the context of information consumption .",
    "meanwhile , another line of work has focused on predicting a paper s long - term impact ( primarily measured by its citation count ) in its early stages  @xcite using various semantic features ( e.g. , author , content , venue ) .",
    "these studies are complementary to this work in that the useful semantic features can be integrated into our framework to train microscopic ( e.g. , author- , content- , and venue - specific ) creativity models .",
    "another use of papers reference relationships is to create citation - based _ maps of science _ or _ knowledge flow maps _",
    "@xcite , which help categorize science and understand papers trans - disciplinary impact . however , these insights do not help explain creativity of individual scientific work .",
    "finally , this work is related to the broad area of computational creativity  @xcite , which focuses on developing artificial intelligence models that exhibit or generate creativity ( e.g. , problem solving  @xcite , visual creativity  @xcite , and linguistic creativity  @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , this work focuses on understanding and modeling creative processes in scientific enterprise .",
    "however , incorporating these intelligence models to enhance the predictive power of our framework would be one promising direction .",
    "next we describe the datasets used in our empirical study .",
    "we used two web - scale , longitudinal datasets , corresponding to information consumption and knowledge production of scientific creative processes , respectively .      at present , the most comprehensive dataset that captures information consumption in scientific enterprise is perhaps the web traffic generated by researchers , reflecting how they request and access online resources ( e.g. , online publication archives ) .",
    "therefore , in our study , we used the indiana university click dataset  @xcite ( ) , which constitutes about 53.5 billion web requests initiated by researchers at indiana university from 09/2006 to 05/2010 .",
    "this anonymized dataset was collected by applying a berkeley packet filter to the web traffic passing through the border router of indiana university and matching all the traffic containing a request .",
    "each request consists of the following fields : @xmath0_timestamp , requested url , referring url , agent , flag_@xmath1 , where `` _ agent _ '' indicates whether the user agent was a browser or a bot , while `` _ flag _ '' indicates whether the request was generated inside or outside of indiana university .",
    "all incoming or bot - generated requests have been filtered .",
    "meanwhile , to capture knowledge production in scientific enterprise , we used the microsoft academic graph dataset  @xcite ( ) . as of 11/06/2015 , this dataset consists of 120.9 million papers published in 24,843 venues across all scientific fields .    in a nutshell ,",
    "the dataset is a web - scale entity graph comprising scientific publication records , citation relationships between publications , as well as their authors , author affiliations , publication venues , keywords and fields - of - study ( i.e. , _ topics _ ) . in particular , all the topics form a four - level hierarchy , with the highest and lowest levels corresponding to disciplines ( e.g. , `` _ computer science _ '' ) and specific subjects ( e.g. , `` _ decision tree _ '' ) , respectively . each keyword is associated with one topic in the hierarchy .",
    "next , to match corresponding information consumption and knowledge production data , we correlate the and datasets as follows .    in the dataset , we identified all the papers that have at least one author affiliated with indiana university and were published during the period from 2007 to present , resulting in a collection of 24,399 papers .",
    "figure  [ fig : pubperyear ] illustrates the number of papers in each scientific field from 2008 to 2014 .",
    "it is noted that both the number and composition of papers vary significantly on a yearly basis .",
    "further , in the dataset , we identified all the web requests that ask for papers in the dataset by matching embedded in the requests with of the papers in the dataset .",
    "the resulting dataset consists of 5.8 million requests for 4.6 million papers ( i.e. , unique requests ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : pubpermon ] illustrates the total number of requests and the number of unique ones per month from 09/2006 to 05/2010 .",
    "note that while the total number of requests fluctuates wildly .",
    "in this section , we present a general creativity definition and apply it to the aforementioned datasets to empirically study scientific publications creativity .",
    "we start by introducing a set of fundamental concepts and assumptions used throughout the paper .",
    "we refer to a scientific publication as a `` paper '' .",
    "we assume that each paper @xmath2 is described by a tuple @xmath3 , representing its publishing time , keywords and references , respectively .",
    "note that this model can be easily extended by including additional information ( e.g. , abstract , full text and publishing venue ) .",
    "further , we refer to each web request with respect to any paper in online publication archives as a `` reading '' .",
    "we assume that a reading is described by a tuple @xmath4 , denoting the reading paper and the time of reading respectively .",
    "note that with respect to a given paper @xmath2 which is requested ( `` read '' ) multiple times , we consider the median of its reading time as @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the papers published within the time period from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , @xmath9 represents all the papers published till @xmath7 .",
    "similarly , denote by @xmath10 the set of papers read during the time window from @xmath7 to @xmath8 . given that ( i ) for a large number of papers in the dataset , only their publishing years are specified and ( ii ) even with finer grained timestamps , a paper s publication often deviates from when it is actually finished , we thus use `` year '' as the default time granularity in our study .",
    "thus , with a little abuse of notations , we use @xmath7 to denote both a timestamp and a one - year - long time window .",
    "for example , @xmath11 represents the set of papers published in year @xmath7 .",
    "a variety of creativity metrics have been proposed in literature ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , all premised on the same intuition : a paper s creativity should be measured by how it blends originally disconnected knowledge . to capture this intuition , one needs to consider two factors : ( i ) the `` disconnect '' ( denoted by @xmath12 ) of knowledge represented by two papers @xmath13 , and ( ii ) the `` rarity '' ( denoted by @xmath14 ) that the knowledge of @xmath13 has been connected in previously published papers .",
    "we define the product of disconnect and rarity , @xmath15 as the creativity score of co - citation of @xmath13 .",
    "we then introduce the following creativity metric .",
    "a paper @xmath2 s overall creativity @xmath16 is the aggregation of creativity scores contributed by all its reference pairs : @xmath17 where @xmath18 represents the aggregation function ( e.g. , average , percentile , maximum ) .",
    "we require that @xmath18 is non - decreasing : if @xmath19 , @xmath20 , then @xmath21 . we remark that this definition subsumes a number of creativity metrics in literature .",
    "for example , the metrics in  @xcite only consider the rarity factor , while the measures in  @xcite only reflect the disconnect factor .",
    "next we discuss the concrete instantiation of @xmath22 .",
    "a variety of forms are possible .",
    "for example , @xmath14 can be gauged using the frequency of co - occurrences of @xmath13 s publishing venues  @xcite .",
    "similar definitions may be given based on papers author or affiliation information . in our study , we define @xmath13 s creativity score within the context of their associated topics .",
    "recall that each keyword in the dataset is associated with one topic .",
    "we define paper @xmath2 s topics ( denoted by @xmath23 ) as the aggregation of topics associated with its keyword set @xmath24 . for example",
    ", the paper `` _ fast algorithms for mining association rules _ ''  @xcite is associated with the keyword of `` _ association rule _ '' , which is mapped to the topic of `` _ association rule learning _ '' .",
    "let @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 be the sets of papers , keywords and topics , respectively .",
    "we introduce a heterogeneous network to describe papers semantic relationships within the context of their topics , as shown in figure  [ fig : trip ] .",
    "the paper network @xmath28 captures papers co - citation relationships ; each edge @xmath29 indicates that two papers @xmath30 are both referenced by some other paper(s ) .",
    "we now introduce the concept of rarity .",
    "the rarity of co - citation of @xmath13 till year @xmath7 , @xmath31 , is defined as follows : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of co - citations of @xmath13 till year @xmath7 .",
    "meanwhile , the topic network @xmath34 encodes the four - level field - of - study hierarchy ; a topic @xmath35 may have one or more parent topics @xmath36 at each higher level @xmath37 .",
    "for example , in figure  [ fig : trip ] , @xmath38 has two parents @xmath39 at level @xmath40 and two parents @xmath41 at level @xmath42 .",
    "given @xmath43 , the weight @xmath44 of edge @xmath45 indicates the confidence that @xmath35 is a sub - topic of @xmath46 , with @xmath47 .",
    "we define the disconnect of @xmath13 based on their topics @xmath48 .",
    "let us start with the simplest case that @xmath49 , i.e. , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath52 lie at the same level of topic hierarchy .",
    "the similarity of @xmath52 is the aggregation of level - wise similarity of @xmath52 and their parents .",
    "three properties are desirable : ( i ) if @xmath53 are identical , their similarity should be 1 ; ( ii ) the similarity @xmath54 of @xmath55 is discounted with respect to @xmath37 ; and ( iii ) @xmath54 is counted only if @xmath56 are not identical .    thus , for @xmath57 to @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) , we compute the level-@xmath37 similarity as : @xmath60",
    ". then the overall similarity of @xmath61 is given as : @xmath62 where the first term represents the `` budget '' after reaching level @xmath37 and @xmath63 is the `` discount '' .",
    "it can be verified that this definition fulfills all three desirable properties .",
    "for example , in figure  [ fig : trip ] , we compute the level - wise similarity of @xmath64 : @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "the overall similarity of @xmath64 is given as : @xmath68 , if @xmath69 .",
    "now we are ready to introduce the disconnect metric :    the disconnect of two reference papers @xmath70 is defined as the average dissimilarity of their topics @xmath48 : @xmath71      next we apply the metrics above in our empirical study . due to space limitations , here we only show results obtained using papers published in 2011 .",
    "similar phenomena are observed regarding papers in other years .",
    "with a little abuse of notations , let @xmath72 denote all the papers published in 2011 by indiana university .",
    "we first measure the rarity and disconnect of all the reference pairs of @xmath72 , i.e. , @xmath73 .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : dandr ] .    figure  [ fig : dandr](a ) shows the cumulative distribution of @xmath13 s rarity @xmath14 .",
    "note that around 60% pairs have zero co - citation before 2011 .",
    "in figure  [ fig : dandr](b ) , we further measure the conditional distribution of @xmath13 s disconnect @xmath12 on its rarity @xmath14 .",
    "the conditional distribution @xmath74 is fairly similar irrespective to varying @xmath14 , implying that disconnect and rarity are two critical , but complementary factors of creativity .",
    "then , according to eqn.([eq : cs ] ) , we integrate @xmath13 s rarity and disconnect to compute its creativity score @xmath22 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : dandr](c ) , the histogram of @xmath22 roughly follows a lognormal distribution .",
    "it can be intuitively explained by that most reference pairs represent modestly `` common '' combinations , while both extremely `` clich '' and `` atypical '' combinations are rare .",
    "finally , we measure the creativity of papers in @xmath72 by aggregating their reference pairs scores .",
    "we consider both average and median as the aggregation function @xmath18 , with results depicted in figure  [ fig : dandr](d ) .",
    "clearly , most of the papers show moderate creativity , which is consistent with the results reported in prior studies  @xcite .",
    "we further investigate the discipline - specific patterns of creativity measures .",
    "figure  [ fig : disp](a)-(b ) demonstrate the histogram of @xmath13 s creativity score @xmath22 in the disciplines of _ biology _ and _ computer science _ respectively .",
    "interestingly , one can observe that @xmath22 roughly follows a lognormal distribution in figure  [ fig : disp](a ) .",
    "meanwhile , in figure  [ fig : disp](b ) , @xmath22 apparently follows a bimodal distribution , peaking at both low and high creativity scores .",
    "such phenomena may be explained by that compared with _ biology _ , _ computer science _ is a relatively `` engineering '' discipline , featuring more frequent fusion of originally disconnected knowledge .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : disp](c)-(d ) , this difference indeed leads to the disparate creativity distributions of papers published in these two disciplines : in general , the papers in _ computer science _ demonstrate higher creativity .",
    "equipped with the metrics introduced above , we are able to quantitatively assess the creativity of a paper , an author , an institution or even a discipline",
    ". next we will explore the _ predictability _ of creativity by directly contrasting authors raw information consumption behaviors against their knowledge products .",
    "we intend to answer the following key question :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ which part of a paper s creativity can be explained by papers read by its authors ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _      we begin with validating the dependency of authors publishing papers on their reading papers . in specific , for the papers published in year @xmath7 , @xmath75 , we compare the set of prior work @xmath76 referenced by @xmath75 ( i.e. , @xmath77 ) against the set of reading papers @xmath78 in an earlier year @xmath8 @xmath79 .",
    "we measure the dependency of @xmath75 on @xmath78 at two distinct levels .",
    "we first directly compare reference set @xmath76 against reading set @xmath78 .",
    "in specific , we measure the paper - level dependency of @xmath75 on @xmath78 by computing the jaccard s coefficient of @xmath76 and @xmath78 : @xmath80    figure  [ fig : dep](a ) illustrates the paper - level dependency in our datasets .",
    "as @xmath7 varies from 2007 to 2014 , we measure the dependency of @xmath75 on @xmath78 for @xmath81 ranging from 2006 to 2009 .",
    "it is observed that this paper - level dependency demonstrates interesting temporal dynamics .",
    "first , given reading set @xmath78 ( i.e. , fixed @xmath8 ) , the dependency of @xmath75 on @xmath78 decreases as @xmath7 grows , implying that the impact of @xmath78 gradually decays over time .",
    "second , for given publication set @xmath75 ( i.e. , fixed @xmath7 ) , its dependency on @xmath78 increases with @xmath8 , implying that more recent reading papers exert more influence over future publications .",
    "we then examine the dependency of publication set @xmath75 on reading set @xmath78 at the topic level .    in specific ,",
    "following the definition of topic disconnect in eqn.([eq : un ] ) , we compute the topic - level dependency of @xmath75 on @xmath78 as the average `` connectedness '' of papers in @xmath75 and @xmath82 : @xmath83    the measurement results are illustrated in figure  [ fig : dep](b ) .",
    "we have the following observations .",
    "the topic - level dependency shows pattens similar to the paper - level dependency : ( i ) the impact of reading papers over future publications decays over time ; ( ii ) more recent reading papers exert stronger influence .",
    "nevertheless , compared with the paper - level dependency , the topic - level dependency seems less `` stratified '' in that adjacent years show more resemble patterns . for instance , the dependency with respect to the reading papers in 2006 and 2007 shows strong similarity .",
    "such phenomena can be explained by that authors interests in particular topics are more stable than their interests in concrete papers .",
    "the study on paper- and topic - level dependency above offers empirical evidences for our premise that authors future publications are heavily influenced by prior literature which they have read .",
    "this also hints that it is conceivable to answer the _ creativity prediction _ question posed at the beginning of this section .      to answer this question",
    ", we introduce a mathematical model to quantify the impact of information consumption in creative processes . to motivate the rationale behind our model ,",
    "let us consider the following concrete example of three papers by three disjoint groups of authors .",
    "@xmath84 : `` _ fast algorithms for mining association rules _ '' .",

    "informally , reading @xmath85 offers the opportunity to bridge the knowledge gap between @xmath84 and @xmath86 .",
    "we capture this intuition using the metric of creativity score defined in eqn.([eq : cs ] ) .",
    "the term @xmath22 can be interpreted as the `` difficulty '' of connecting @xmath13 , while the exposure to @xmath85 may potentially reduce this difficulty .",
    "that is , instead of directly connecting @xmath70 , one may now first connect @xmath84 to @xmath85 , and then link @xmath85 to @xmath86 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : jump ] .",
    "formally , we introduce a metric to describe the impact of paper @xmath85 on the creativity required to connect @xmath13 : @xmath88 where the term @xmath89 represents the difficulty of connecting @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "note that this definition can be generalized to the case that @xmath92 papers @xmath93 collectively bridge the gap of @xmath13 by creating an @xmath92-hop `` path '' between them .",
    "let @xmath94 .",
    "we may define the impact of @xmath95 to @xmath13 as : @xmath96 .",
    "due to space limitations , in the following discussion we focus on the case of @xmath97 .",
    "we are now ready to perform an anatomy of the creativity @xmath22 required to connect the knowledge represented by two papers @xmath13 . for simplicity , consider the case that during this creative process , the authors read a single paper @xmath85 .",
    "we divide @xmath22 into two complementary parts .",
    "`` preparation '' - the marginal reduction in the difficulty of connecting @xmath13 , due to the authors reading , which is quantified by @xmath98 .",
    "`` inspiration '' - the part of creativity that can not be explained by the authors reading , which is quantified by @xmath99 .    since a given paper blends the knowledge in all its references , a dichomatic theory naturally follows .",
    "that is , a paper s creativity reflects a superimpose of both effects :    formally , consider a paper @xmath2 with @xmath100 as its reference set .",
    "assume that @xmath2 s authors have read a set of papers @xmath101 during their creative process .",
    "as given in eqn.([eq : cr ] ) , @xmath2 s overall creativity is assessed by : @xmath102 . for each pair",
    "@xmath103 , we identify a reading paper in @xmath101 that maximally impacts @xmath22 and compute its impact as : @xmath104    for reference pair @xmath105 , the paper @xmath106 in reading set @xmath101 that maximally impacts @xmath22 , @xmath107 is called an enabler .    thus , after discounting the preparation quantity embodied in @xmath101 , the inspiration of @xmath2 , @xmath108 , is measured as : @xmath109 while the preparation quantity @xmath110 is computed as the difference of creativity and inspiration measures : @xmath111      in the creativity theory above",
    ", the definition of @xmath101 is critical for accurately quantifying preparation and inspiration .",
    "while one may regard all the papers read by given authors in the past as @xmath101 , this simplification ignores the temporal dynamics of information production - consumption dependency observed in   [ sec : dependency ] , resulting in an overestimation of preparation quantities . here",
    "we will address this issue .",
    "it is extremely difficult to directly assess the temporal dynamics of a reading paper @xmath85 s impact over a future publishing paper @xmath2 .",
    "however , by studying in general how authors access papers in the intersection of reference and reading sets ( i.e. , @xmath112 ) , we are able to build a surrogate temporal dynamics model .",
    "specifically , for @xmath113 , we examine @xmath85 s reading time ( @xmath114 ) and @xmath2 s publishing time ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "the difference ( @xmath116 ) reflects the temporal interval between information consumption and knowledge production .",
    "figure  [ fig : correlation](a ) shows that this interval follows a log - log distribution , which is consistent with the studies on papers `` aging '' phenomena  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath117 represent this distribution . by discretizing and normalizing @xmath117 ,",
    "we compute the probability that a reading paper influences a future paper published @xmath118 years later , i.e. , @xmath119 .    putting everything together",

    "next we apply this theory to explain the creativity of papers in our datasets .",
    "applying algorithm  [ alg : sampling ] , we first assess the preparation and inspiration quantities of papers published in 2011 ( similar phenomena are observed in other years ) .",

    "also interestingly , the quantity of preparation varies with specific disciplines : it counts for 21.9% and 29.2% of creativity in the disciplines of _ computer science _ and _ biology _ , respectively .",

    "the target paper @xmath2 : `` _ engaging online learners : the impact of web - based learning technology on college student engagement _ '' cites two papers @xmath84 : `` _ a comprehensive look at online student support services for distance learners _ '' and @xmath86 : `` _ do computers enhance or detract from student learning ? _ '' .",
    "the reading paper @xmath85 : `` _ the convergent and discriminant validity of nsse scalelet scores _ '' reduces @xmath22 from 0.661 to 0.495 .    at a first glance ,",
    "@xmath85 is not relevant to either @xmath84 or @xmath86 . yet , after manually examining the full text of these papers , one may notice the following connection : to build an online learning environment ( @xmath84 s knowledge ) , it is critical to effectively assess student engagement in this new environment ( @xmath86 s knowledge ) , while @xmath85 indeed provides a metric to evaluate student engagement .",
    "finally , we investigate the relationships of preparation and inspiration with other important metrics of scientific work .",
    "in particular , we focus on a paper s citation count , the de facto metric of its long - term impact  @xcite .    figure  [ fig : influence ] plots the correlation of a paper @xmath2 s preparation @xmath110 and inspiration @xmath108 with its citation count @xmath124 .",
    "again , we examine papers in the disciplines of _ biology _ and _ computer science _ separately . in both cases",
    ", @xmath124 is positivity correlated with @xmath110 , implying that a paper grounded deeper into exiting work is better received by the research community .",
    "more interesting is the correlation of @xmath124 and @xmath108 : it is positive in the case of _ computer science _ , yet slightly negative in the case of _ biology_.",
    "this may be explained by that as a younger and more vibrant discipline , the _ computer science _ community tends to be more welcoming to radical ideas that blend previously disconnected knowledge .",
    "clearly , the creativity , preparation and inspiration metrics provide a new perspective to assess scientific publications merits .",
    "we envision that in synergy with other metrics ( e.g. , citation count ) , they may lead to more comprehensive understanding of long - term impact of scientific work .",
    "in this section , levering the insights derived from our empirical study , we develop a predictive model that is able to identify the most promising enablers with respect to target papers . we then present efficient optimization algorithms for this model .      without loss of generality , we start with the setting of a single target paper , and will discuss the extension to multiple target papers shortly .",
    "let @xmath2 denote the target paper , which connects a set of disparate knowledge , as represented by a set of references @xmath100 . among all existing literature @xmath125 , we intend to find a minimum set of reading papers @xmath126 that maximally facilitate to connect @xmath100 .",
    "more formally , our goal is to solve the following optimization problem : @xmath127 with the constraint of @xmath128 ( @xmath129 as the threshold ) .",
    "let @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "we can simplify this problem as : @xmath132    we may interpret @xmath133 and @xmath134 respectively as the `` reward '' and `` cost '' functions , and @xmath129 as the `` budget '' that one is allowed to spend .",
    "next we discuss its optimization .",
    "it is noticed that the objective function @xmath133 in eqn.([eq : max ] ) possesses a set of interesting properties .",
    "non - negative - @xmath135 ; that is , @xmath2 s creativity does not change if no reading paper is taken into account .",
    "non - decreasing - if @xmath136 , then @xmath137 .",
    "intuitively , reading more papers can only reduce @xmath2 s creativity .    diminishing return - given @xmath136 , reading one more paper in addition to @xmath138 improves @xmath139 at least as much as reading it in addition to @xmath140 .",
    "more formally ,    given @xmath136 and a paper @xmath141 , it holds that @xmath142 thus , @xmath139 is a submodular function  @xcite .",
    "first note that in @xmath139 , for a given target paper @xmath2 , @xmath143 is input - independent .",
    "we thus focus our discussion on @xmath144 .",
    "let us consider @xmath136 and a reading paper @xmath141 .    for ease of exposition ,",
    "we assume that @xmath138 ( and @xmath140 ) contains a special element @xmath145 , which corresponds to the case that no paper is selected from @xmath138 ( and @xmath140 ) . for each pair @xmath105 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "since @xmath148 , it holds that @xmath149 .",
    "let @xmath150 = @xmath151 .",
    "we consider the following three cases .",
    "\\(i ) @xmath152 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath153 = @xmath154 = @xmath155 ; thus @xmath156 @xmath157 @xmath158 .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "this implies @xmath154 = @xmath153 = @xmath161 = @xmath162 .",
    "thus , @xmath156 @xmath163 @xmath158 .",
    "\\(iii ) @xmath159 and @xmath164 .",
    "this implies @xmath154 = @xmath161 and @xmath165 , i.e. , @xmath156 @xmath157 @xmath158 .    in all three cases above",
    ", it holds that @xmath156 @xmath157 @xmath158 .",
    "because the aggregation function @xmath18 ( e.g. , average , percentile , maximum ) is non - decreasing ( cf   [ sec : measurement ] ) , it leads to @xmath166 .",
    "@xmath167 return @xmath138      in general , maximizing a submodular function is known to be np - hard  @xcite . yet , as each paper @xmath168 has unit cost , a greedy algorithm is applicable , which provides near - optimal guarantee for the found results .",
    "next we introduce such an algorithm , as sketched in algorithm  [ alg : sub ] .",
    "let @xmath169 denote the set of selected papers after the @xmath170-th step .",
    "starting with an empty set @xmath171 , and iteratively , at the @xmath170-th step , it adds the paper @xmath172 to @xmath173 , such that the following marginal gain is maximized : @xmath174 this process stops if the marginal gain reaches zero or the budget is used up .",
    "algorithm  [ alg : sub ] provides the following near - optimal guarantee for the found enablers .",
    "given that the function @xmath139 is submodular , nondecreasing , and @xmath135 , then the greedy algorithm finds @xmath138 , such that @xmath175 .",
    "next we extend algorithm  [ alg : sub ] along two directions : ( i ) handling the case of multiple target papers and ( ii ) taking account of temporal dynamics of information production - consumption dependency .",
    "let @xmath176 .",
    "we update the objective function as : @xmath177 where @xmath178 is paper @xmath2 s weight , indicating its importance , with @xmath179 and @xmath180 .    under this multi - criterion setting , there may be cases that two solutions @xmath181 are incompatible , i.e. , @xmath182 while @xmath183 . instead of looking for the optimal solution , we resort to finding a pareto - optimal solution  @xcite . a solution",
    "@xmath138 is pareto - optimal if no other solution @xmath184 satisfies that ( i ) @xmath185 for all @xmath186 and @xmath187 , and ( ii ) @xmath188 for a specific @xmath189 .",
    "as @xmath139 is a non - negative linear combination of submodular functions , any solution that maximizes @xmath139 is guaranteed to be pareto - optimal  @xcite . moreover , since the submodularity is closed under the non - negative linear combinations , algorithm  [ alg : sub ] can be readily applied .",
    "furthermore , we take into account the temporal dynamics of information production - consumption dependency ( cf .  ",
    "[ sec : theory ] ) . to build the temporal dynamics model , for @xmath113",
    ", we examine @xmath85 s publishing time ( @xmath190 ) and @xmath2 s publishing time ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "the difference ( @xmath191 ) reflects the temporal gap between @xmath85 and @xmath2 s publishing .",
    "figure  [ fig : correlation](b ) shows that this interval fits a log - log distribution , denoted by @xmath117 . by discretizing and normalizing @xmath117 ,",
    "we compute the probability that a paper published @xmath118 years ago influences a current paper , i.e. , @xmath119 .",
    "similar to algorithm  [ alg : sampling ] , we incorporate this temporal dynamics into algorithm  [ alg : sub ] ( line 7 - 9 ) .",
    "we omit the details due to space limitations .      to validate the effectiveness of our solution , we apply algorithm  [ alg : sub ] to predicting the most influential enablers for papers published by indiana university in a specific year @xmath7 .",
    "specifically , we assume that each paper @xmath192 is of uniform importance , i.e. , @xmath193 .",
    "we consider all papers published before year @xmath7 in the dataset as the literature space @xmath125 ( about 20 million papers for 2010 and 2011 ) .",
    "we then measure the precision of our prediction algorithm : the proportion of selected papers @xmath138 that appear in the reading set @xmath101 of the dataset , i.e. , @xmath194 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pick ] illustrates the measurement results for @xmath7 = 2010 and 2011 .",
    "it is observed that our prediction model is fairly scalable : in both cases , it quickly converges using less than 10 iterations .",
    "furthermore , among the selected papers @xmath138 , most of them indeed appear in the reading set @xmath101 ( with precision over 83% in both cases ) , highlighting the effectiveness of our predictive model .",
    "in this work , we conducted a systematic study on creativity in scientific enterprise . for the first time , by directly correlating authors raw information consumption behaviors with their knowledge products , we found remarkable predictability in scientific creative processes : of over 59.0% papers across all scientific fields , 25.7% of their creativity can be readily explained by information consumed by their authors . leveraging these findings",
    ", we proposed a predictive framework that captures the impact of authors information consumption over their future knowledge products . by using two web - scale , longitudinal real datasets , we demonstrated the efficacy of our framework in identifying the most critical knowledge to fostering target scientific innovations .",
    "our framework is not limited to scientific creative processes only .",
    "indeed , its mechanistic nature makes it potentially applicable for describing creative processes in other domains as well , such as musical , artistic and linguistics creativity .",
    "this work also opens up several directions that are worth future investigations .",
    "for example , due to privacy and technology constraints , our study tracks information consumption and knowledge production at an organizational level .",
    "thus , extending such study to an individual level could be fruitful and potentially shed new light on the nature of creativity .",
    "furthermore , recent work has shown that various semantic features ( e.g. , author , content , venue ) can be used to predict long - term impact of scientific artifacts in their early stages .",
    "such semantic features could be integrated into our framework to train microscopic ( author- , content- , and venue - specific ) creativity models .",
    "lastly , our model makes falsifiable prediction for creative processes , making it a viable candidate to assess and guide experimental studies , results of which can feed back to and improve the model with more accurate and realistic predictions .",
