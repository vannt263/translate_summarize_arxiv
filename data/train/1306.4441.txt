    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) is generally classified into three phases ( see snow & mccall 2006 ) : the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) , the warm ionized medium or warm neutral medium ( wim or wnm ) , and the hot ionized medium ( him ; also known as the intercloud medium or the coronal gas ) .",
    "the cnm itself contains a variety of cloud types ( e.g. , diffuse clouds , translucent clouds and molecular clouds ) , spanning a wide range of physical and chemical conditions . in diffuse clouds ( e.g. , sightlines toward @xmath8 oph and @xmath8 per )",

    "van dishoeck ( 1994 ) defined diffuse clouds as regions in which the transition of h from atomic to molecular form occurs . [ ft : cloud ] ] in translucent clouds , hydrogen is mostly in molecular ( h@xmath5 ) and the transition of carbon from ionized ( c@xmath9 ) to atomic ( c ) or molecular ( co ) form takes place ( e.g. , the high latitude cirrus clouds , see magnani et al .   1985 ) .",
    "these clouds have @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 and are thick enough for co millimeter lines to be detectable . in molecular clouds ( which are variously referred to as dense clouds , dark clouds , or dark molecular clouds ) and infrared ( ir ) dark clouds with @xmath16 .",

    "they are cold ( with @xmath17 ) , subject to large dust extinction ( with @xmath18 ) , and their densities typically exceed @xmath19 .",
    "we note that dense cloud material is often surrounded by translucent material which , in turn , is often surrounded by diffuse cloud material .",
    "interstellar clouds become either diffuse , translucent or molecular , depending on the extent to which ultraviolet ( uv ) photons can penetrate into the clouds : with little extinction , diffuse clouds are almost fully exposed to the interstellar uv radiation so that nearly all molecules are destroyed by photodissociation ( but also see footnote [ ft : cloud ] ) , in molecular clouds where the large dust extinction highly attenuates the interstellar uv radiation , molecules are protected from being photodissociated , while translucent clouds fall in between these two extremes .",
    "dust plays a crucial role in governing the physical and chemical states of interstellar molecules and determining the physical and chemical structures of interstellar clouds .",
    "apart from providing surfaces for the formation of some molecules ( e.g. , h@xmath5 ) , dust , through the scattering and absorption of starlight , controls the attenuation of uv radiation passing through the clouds and the depth to which uv radiation penetrates into the clouds .",
    "hence dust extinction  the sum of absorption and scattering  is a crucial parameter in modeling the chemistry of interstellar clouds .",

    "low - density regions usually has a rather low value of @xmath29 .",

    "theoretically , @xmath29 may become infinity in dense regions rich in very large , `` gray '' grains ( i.e. , the extinction caused by these grains does not vary much with wavelength ) , while the steep extinction produced completely by rayleigh scattering would have @xmath32 @xcite .",

    "a `` universal '' power law also well describes the near - ir polarization @xmath43 which , like the near - ir extinction , probes the large grain population , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the peak polarization ( martin & whittet 1990 ) .",
    "however , much steeper power - laws have also been derived for the near - ir extinction .",

    "they argued that the discrepancy ( i.e. , a much steeper power exponent of @xmath49 than the typical value of @xmath50 ) is due to an inappropriate choice of filter wavelength in conversion from color excess ratios to @xmath38 and that effective rather than isophotal wavelengths would be more appropriate .",

    "as for the `` co  strong '' region , the peak intensity of the additional component is slightly weaker than that of the coalsack nebula component , while the integrated intensity is comparable .",
    "the starlight intensity of the coalsack nebula is likely weaker than that of the background cloud as the coalsack is illuminated by the external interstellar radiation field , while the background is at least also excited by the general interstellar radiation field or even by an embeded or nearby star .",
    "therefore , the co  strong region of the coalsack nebula could be relatively denser than the background cloud and the dust properties derived for the co  strong region in this work could be contaminated by dust in an environment which is less dense .",

    "if we fix the h@xmath5o ice abundance at what is required by the 3.6@xmath1 extinction , in order for co and co@xmath5 to explain the 4.5@xmath1 excess extinction , we have to enhance their abundances ( relative to their typical abundances in dense clouds ) by a factor of @xmath233 for @xmath178 ( see figure  [ fig : ice.ext]b ) .",
    "the required co and co@xmath5 abundances are unrealistically too high : @xmath234 and @xmath235 .",
    "also , the model still could not account for the flat extinction at 5.8@xmath1 and 8.0@xmath1 ( see figure  [ fig : ice.ext]b ) .",
    "the 3.1@xmath1 h@xmath5o ice absorption band has been detected in the coalsack nebula .",
    "@xcite observed the lines of sight toward eight field stars lying behind three of the densest globules in the coalsack nebula ( i.e. , globules 1 , 2 , and 3 ) with the ctio 4 m telescope and its ir spectrometer .",
    "they reported the detection of strong ice absorption in two sources ( ss1 - 2 in globule 1 and d7 in globule 2 ) , moderate or weak ice absorption in five sources ( d4 , d11 , e9 , and e18 in globule 2 , and ss3 - 1 in globule 3 ) , and very weak or no ice absorption in one source ( e2 in globule 2 ) .",
    "the sightlines toward these stars are ideal for investigating the regional variations of the mid - ir extinction and particularly for examining the nature of the irac 4.5@xmath1 extinction excess .",
    "the optical depth of the 3.1@xmath1 ice absorption feature @xmath7 probes well whether a region is dense or diffuse : it is only seen in dense clouds and it is generally true that the higher @xmath7 is , the denser is the cloud . if the irac 4.5@xmath1 extinction excess is caused by co and co@xmath5 ices , it should be more prominent in sightlines with strong ice absorption ( e.g. , d7 in globule 2 ) and much less prominent or even disappear in sightlines with very weak or no ice absorption ( e.g. , e2 in globule 2 )    we use the `` color - excess '' method ( see  3.1 ) and take rg stars as tracers to derive the mid - ir extinction in the irac bands for the six globule 2 sightlines studied by smith et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . in order to have enough sources ( for each sightline ) which can be used to derive extinction statistically , we consider an area of @xmath236 centered around each given star . as d4 and d11",
    "are very close and their ice absorption strengths are comparable , we combine them into one region ( hereafter `` d4/d11 '' ) .",
    "the region that contains e9 is not considered since it overlaps parts of e2 and e18 and is difficult to separate it from them . therefore , we have four regions for ir extinction studies : e2  very weak ice absorption ( @xmath237 ) , e18  moderate or weak ice absorption ( @xmath238 ) , d4/d11  moderate or weak ice absorption ( @xmath239 ) , and d7  strong ice absorption ( @xmath240 ) .",
    "the parameters ( including the number of rg stars ) of these regions are tabulated in table  [ tab : icesources ] . in table",
    "[ tab : iceirext ] we tabulate the near - ir extinction power exponent @xmath38 derived from the _",
    "2mass _ photometry and the extinction ratio @xmath6 in the four irac bands .",
    "the results are illustrated in figure  [ fig : iceregions ] .",
    "it is apparent that @xmath6 in the irac bands increases with the decrease of @xmath7 .",
    "this is consistent with our results for the `` diffuse '' , `` av ",
    "large '' , `` av  trans '' , `` co  strong '' and `` co  weak '' regions : the mid - ir extinction curve flattens in less dense regions ( provided that the dust is small ) , suggesting that the dust in the coalsack nebula has not grown sufficiently even in the dense cloud sightline .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found that in the coalsack nebula , above a threshold of @xmath241 , the 3.1@xmath1 h@xmath5o absorption optical depth @xmath7 correlates with the visual extinction @xmath94 : @xmath242 .",
    "such a correlation is also seen in the taurus dark cloud ( a quiescent molecular cloud free from embedded young high mass stars ) but with a smaller @xmath94 threshold : @xmath243 ( whittet et al .  1988b , smith et al .",
    "1993 , whittet et al .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 2002 ) argued that there may exist a diffuse component contributing @xmath199 to the extinction of the dense globules .",
    "therefore , even the total visual extinction @xmath94 is large toward a sightline , it may not necessarily be very dense ( it might just be a pile - up of a long column of diffuse material ) .",
    "this also explains why the `` av  large '' region has a flatter mid - ir extinction curve than the `` av  trans '' region .",
    "this also explains why the dust in the coalsack nebula has not grown effectively , just like that the ice mantles have not been effectively built up on grains .",
    "we note that irac 4.5@xmath1 extinction excess is prominent in e2 , the sightline with very weak or no ice absorption . on the other hand , although the 4.5@xmath1 extinction excess is also seen in d7  the sightline with strong ice absorption , it is much weaker .",
    "no detection of the 4.27@xmath1 co@xmath5 ice feature or the 4.67@xmath1 co ice feature was reported .",
    "therefore , the 4.5@xmath1 extinction excess can not be attributed to co and co@xmath5 ices .",
    "the origin of the 4.5@xmath1 excess extinction remains unknown .",
    "some red giants have circumstellar envelopes rich in co gas which absorbs at 4.6@xmath1@xcite . with red giants as a tracer of the mid - ir extinction",
    ", the 4.6@xmath1 absorption feature of their co gas could result in an overestimation of the irac 4.5@xmath1 extinction .",
    "it is worth exploring whether the co gas absorption of red giants could account for the 4.5@xmath1 excess extinction .",
    "using data from the near - ir _ 2mass _ survey and the mid - ir _ spitzer_/glipmse legacy program , we have derived the mid - ir extinction curves of five regions in the starless coalsack nebula , spanning a range of interstellar environments from diffuse through translucent to dense clouds . the ( relative ) extinction @xmath6 in the four _ spitzer_/irac bands ( [ 3.6 ] , [ 4.5 ] , [ 5.8 ] , [ 8.0]@xmath1 ) are determined using the color - excess method and taking red giants as tracers .",
    "it is found that :    1 .",
    "the mid - ir extinction curve exhibits appreciable regional variations .",
    "the extinction ratios @xmath4 in the irac bands are higher in diffuse regions than in denser regions .",
    "these variations can be explained in terms of dust size effects : the dust in dense regions is larger than that in diffuse regions , provided that the dust is small ( i.e. , it has not yet grown effectively in the coalsack nebula ) .",

    "the extinction in the irac 4.5@xmath1 band is much higher than that of the other three irac bands .",
    "it can not be explained in terms of the 4.27@xmath1 absorption band of @xmath244 ice and the 4.67@xmath1 absorption band of co ice .",
    "it may be caused by the 4.6@xmath1 absorption feature of co gas in the circumstellar envelopes of some red giants .",

    "<S> 2mass _ and _ spitzer_/glimpse surveys . </S>",
    "<S> we select five individual regions across the nebula that span a wide variety of physical conditions , ranging from diffuse , translucent to dense environments , as traced by the visual extinction , the _ </S>",
    "<S> spitzer_/mips 24@xmath1 emission , and co emission . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath4 , the mid - ir extinction relative to @xmath2 , decreases from diffuse to dense environments , which may be explained in terms of ineffective dust growth in dense regions . </S>",
    "<S> the mean extinction ( relative to @xmath2 ) is calculated for the four irac bands as well , which exhibits a flat mid - ir extinction law , consistent with previous determinations for other regions . </S>",
    "<S> the extinction in the irac 4.5@xmath1 band is anomalously high , much higher than that of the other three irac bands . </S>",
    "<S> it can not be explained in terms of co and co@xmath5 ices . </S>",
    "<S> the mid - ir extinction in the four irac bands have also been derived for four representative regions in the coalsack globule 2 which respectively exhibit strong ice absorption , moderate or weak ice absorption , and very weak or no ice absorption . </S>",
    "<S> the derived mid - ir extinction curves are all flat , with @xmath6 increasing with the decrease of the 3.1@xmath1 h@xmath5o ice absorption optical depth @xmath7 . </S>"
