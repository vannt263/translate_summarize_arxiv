    "chains of interacting spins are important models for investigating properties of quantum many - body systems .",
    "the fact that the dimension of the hilbert space grows exponentially with the length of the chains does , however , limit the applicability of brute force numerical computations .",
    "this makes analytical insights particularly valuable , both as a direct source of information and as a starting point for constructing and testing approximate numerical methods .",
    "important analytical techniques include the bethe ansatz @xcite and the construction lying behind the aklt model @xcite .",
    "the former was introduced by bethe in 1931 to solve the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model with nearest - neighbour interactions and has turned out to be a more generally applicable tool to solve particular spin models , and the latter has led to a number of models for which both the hamiltonian and the corresponding ground state(s ) are known .",
    "solvable models with long - range interactions are more rare , but the haldane - shastry ( hs ) model @xcite is an example . in this model ,",
    "@xmath4 spin @xmath5 particles are positioned uniformly on a circle , and each spin interacts with all other spins through a two - body exchange interaction whose strength is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the spins measured along the chord .    in the present paper , we propose a new method to find matching hamiltonians and ground state wave functions , which naturally leads to models with long - range interactions .",
    "the approach , which is presented in detail in section [ sec : hamiltonians ] , relies on the existence of null vectors in conformal field theories ( cft ) , and we shall specifically consider the @xmath0 wzw models , where @xmath1 is a positive integer known as the level of the algebra .",
    "the vacuum expectation value of a product of primary chiral conformal fields is zero if one of the fields is a null vector , and we use this fact and the ward identity to derive equations of the form @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a hermitian and positive semidefinite operator and @xmath8 is a chiral correlator ( i.e. , the vacuum expectation value of a product of primary chiral fields ) .",
    "explicit analytical expressions for several of the relevant chiral correlators have been found recently in @xcite .",
    "in addition to deriving new spin models , the null vectors enable us to derive a set of simple algebraic linear equations , which relate different @xmath9-point spin correlators within each model ( i.e. , expectation values of the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the @xmath12 component of the spin operator acting on spin number @xmath13 ) .",
    "the approach turns out to be particularly valuable for @xmath2 , where it leads to a closed set of equations for the two - point spin correlators , a closed set of equations for the two - point and the four - point spin correlators and so on . as detailed below , this allows us to obtain a number of results for spin correlators either analytically or through a very simple numerical computation .    after explaining the general approach , which is valid for all @xmath1",
    ", we turn to a more detailed investigation of models obtained at levels @xmath2 and @xmath3 in sections [ sec : keq1 ] and [ sec : keq2 ] , respectively . in the @xmath14 wzw model , there are only spin 0 and spin 1/2 chiral conformal fields , and since the fusion properties of the spin 0 field are trivial , we find the explicit expression for a hamiltonian which has the chiral correlator of @xmath4 spin @xmath5 fields as its ground state in section [ sec : keq1hw ] .",
    "the hamiltonian involves only two - body interactions , and in section [ sec : keq1hs ] , we show that it is essentially a nonuniform generalization of the hs model with long - range exchange interactions .",
    "we also compute the spectrum for a number of choices of distributions for @xmath15 and discuss symmetries and the origin of degeneracies .",
    "the hamiltonian of the nonuniform hs model was put forward recently in @xcite , where it was shown analytically that the chiral correlator of @xmath4 spin @xmath5 fields is an eigenstate of it .",
    "this was done by using the knizhnik - zamolodchikov ( kz ) equation @xcite , and we provide the details of that derivation in [ sec : alternative ] .",
    "in contrast to the present work , however , this approach can not be straightforwardly generalized to higher values of @xmath1 , and it does not automatically guarantee that the chiral correlator is , indeed , the ground state .",
    "the nonuniform hs model was compared to other spin models through exact numerical computations for small @xmath4 in @xcite , and the finite chain renyi entropy and the two - point spin correlation function was studied numerically through monte carlo simulations . in the present paper , we instead concentrate on the analytical and semi - analytical expressions for the spin correlators that follow from the properties of the null vectors through the aforementioned linear equations .",
    "we rederive the expression for the two - point spin correlator of the uniform hs model in the thermodynamic limit and furthermore demonstrate that the two - point spin correlator can also be computed analytically for the finite chain uniform hs model .",
    "these results are presented in section [ sec : keq1cf ] , where we also provide further numerical results for two - point and four - point spin correlators .",
    "section [ sec : keq2 ] is devoted to an investigation of the case @xmath3 . in this model , there are spin 0 , spin 1/2 and spin 1 chiral conformal fields , and we shall , in particular , analyze the spin chain model in which the wave function is the chiral correlator of a product of @xmath4 spin 1 fields . in section [ sec : ham1 ] , we derive the hamiltonian and discuss the spectrum . in section [ sec : bilinear ] , we find that the wave function has an overlap with the ground state of the bilinear - biquadratic spin 1 chain close to unity in a region within the haldane phase for @xmath15 . in section [ sec : entcor1 ] , we compute the renyi entropy and the two - point spin correlation function by monte carlo simulations . we find that the renyi entropy grows logarithmically with the length of the considered subchain , while the two - point spin correlation function decays algebraically with the separation between the spins .",
    "the hamiltonian for the chiral correlator of a product of @xmath4 spin 1/2 fields is given in [ sec : k2spinhalf ] together with a discussion of the spectrum . finally , concluding remarks are given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",

    "altogether , it is hence possible that the properties of the wave function are those of the @xmath413 wzw model , but it may also be that there are some deviations .",
    "in conclusion , we have used a specific set of null vectors to derive quantum spin hamiltonians , whose ground states are the chiral correlators of the @xmath0 wzw model , and we have shown that the same null vectors lead to a set of algebraic , linear equations relating the spin correlators within each model . at level @xmath2 ,",
    "these equations are sufficient to compute both two - point and higher - point spin correlators simply by solving a set of linear equations , which can even be done analytically in some cases .",
    "the models involve hamiltonians with long - range interactions , and explicit analytical expressions for the corresponding ground state wave functions can be found in many cases .",
    "the examples presented in the paper include both new spin models and new results for already known models .",
    "it is interesting to note that our construction in some sense resembles that of the aklt @xcite bond in matrix product states ( mps ) and frustration free parent hamiltonians . as in mps",
    ", the components of the wave functions are constructed from a product of @xmath4 operators ( see ( [ dec1 ] ) ) , where the @xmath53th operator depends only on the state of the @xmath53th spin , but the operators are chiral conformal fields instead of finite dimensional matrices .",
    "similarly , the hamiltonian is a sum of @xmath4 hamiltonians ( see ( [ dec14 ] ) ) that annihilate the ground state individually , but the hamiltonians involve long - range interactions rather than only local interactions . these differences , in fact , circumvent one of the limitations of mps , namely how correlation functions may decay algebraically , and thus one can also use the states to describe critical behaviour .    the uniform haldane - shastry model is closely related to the calogero - sutherland ( cs ) model , whose hamiltonian contains a kinetic term plus an inverse square coupling between particles moving on a circle @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) . in turn ,",
    "particular eigenfunctions of the cs model are in direct correspondence with the correlation functions in boundary conformal field theory .",
    "in fact , the cs hamiltonian can be obtained from the null vector decoupling equations at level 2 of boundary fields and a bulk primary field at the centre of the disk @xcite .",
    "these results suggest a possible relation of our work to those of @xcite , although the null vectors used there and those used in the present work are different .",
    "the present paper raises the question , whether the properties of the wave functions are directly related to the properties of the fields used to construct the wave functions . the properties of the uniform model with @xmath2 and @xmath424 @xcite and the numerical results presented above for the two - point spin correlator and the renyi entropy for the uniform model with @xmath3 and @xmath421 suggest that the properties of the wave function may be similar to , but not necessarily identical to , the properties of the fields .",
    "we are currently investigating this question in more detail .",
    "there are several ways in which the explicit examples given in the paper can be generalized .",
    "the construction in section [ sec : hamiltonians ] already includes the possibility to consider models at higher levels , models in which the fields used to construct the wave functions do not all have the same spin index , and models in which the individual terms @xmath484 are given different weights in the final hamiltonian .",
    "furthermore , we have only considered one particular set of null vectors , but other hamiltonians can be derived by starting from other null vectors .",
    "the present work shows that translationally invariant models of one - dimensional spin chains with long - range interactions can be achieved by choosing the @xmath321-coordinates to be uniformly distributed on the unit circle .",
    "more generally , the @xmath321-coordinates are numbers in the complex plane , and various interaction patterns can be achieved by adjusting these coordinates .",
    "this observation facilitates the construction of higher dimensional spin models .",
    "in particular , it is natural to describe a two - dimensional spin lattice in the above framework by interpreting , e.g. , the real and imaginary parts of @xmath321 as the coordinates of the physical position of the @xmath53th spin in the lattice .",
    "this construction will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "finally , the idea of finding hamiltonians from null vectors can also be applied to any lie group and to wzw models based on supergroups .",
    "altogether , the present work thus opens up possibilities to find a huge class of spin models .",
    "we conclude that null vectors are a powerful tool to gain insight into the behaviour of many - body systems , and we believe that more results will be obtained along these lines .",
