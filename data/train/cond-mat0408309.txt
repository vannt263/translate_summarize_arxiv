    "hydrogenated amorphous silicon ( @xmath0-si : h ) , technologically an important material which suffers from the light - induced degradation [ staebler - wronski effect @xcite ] , has been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically @xcite . however , the issues related to its various microscopic properties such as coordination defects @xcite , vibrational localization @xcite , lifetime and decay of phonons @xcite , electronic gap states @xcite , distribution and dynamics of hydrogen @xcite are still the subjects of debate .",
    "several studies show that this material exhibits structural inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "the study of pure and hydrogenated amorphous silicon is also important from other perspectives as these are prototypes of disordered covalent semiconducting materials .",
    "@xmath0-si : h can be grown by various techniques including sputtering @xcite and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition ( pecvd ) @xcite . for experimental studies and practical applications",
    "it is grown in thin films @xcite , whereas for theoretical studies it is generated by using systematic computer simulation techniques .",
    "these techniques make use of empirical @xcite or _ ab - intio _ pseudo potentials @xcite in conjunction with monte carlo @xcite and md simulations @xcite which allow simulations of thermal treatments similar to those used in laboratories to prepare the actual samples .",
    "currently , there are many realistic atomic models of pure amorphous silicon available ( upto 100000 atoms @xcite ) which have been generated by using the continuous random network forming computer algorithms @xcite . however , due to difficulties in modelling the interactions of hydrogen in the bulk silicon and a small time step needed for the dynamics of hydrogen , the modelling of hydrogenated amorphous silicon is limited and has been achieved mainly by md simulations @xcite",
    ". moreover , the theoretical understanding of its various structural , vibrational and electronic properties is still not complete and motivates for extensive studies .",
    "due to its non - equilibrated nature , @xmath0-si : h shows a variation in its properties depending on the sample preparation conditions . in this paper",
    "we address the question of dependence of various properties of @xmath0-si : h on the preparation conditions .",
    "we have generated four samples of @xmath0-si : h with 216 si atoms and 24 h atoms using the density functional based tight binding ( dftb ) approach @xcite .",
    "two samples of @xmath0-si : h are generated from the liquid quench at two different quenching rates while the other two are generated by the hydrogenation of two different pure amorphous silicon samples .",
    "one sample of pure amorphous silicon is generated from the liquid quench by the same dftb approach while the other one is due to wooten _",
    "frauenheim et al .",
    "have successfully used the dftb approach @xcite to generate the structure of @xmath0-si : h ( 120 si and 8 h atoms ) and studied its structural and dynamical properties @xcite .",
    "but in this paper , we studied the sample dependence of the structural , vibrational and electronic properties of various samples of @xmath0-si : h generated by using the same dftb approach .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the computational details of methods used for generating samples and subsequent calculations of dynamical matrix , localization of vibrational modes , vdos , thermodynamic properties from the vdos and electronic density of states are given in sec ii .",
    "the results of our calculations are discussed in sec iii and summarized in sec iv .",
    "we have used dftb molecular dynamics scheme of frauenheim _ et al . _ @xcite to generate the structures of pure and hydrogenated amorphous silicon and to calculate their vibrational and electronic properties . for the structural relaxation ,",
    "we sample the brillouin zone of the supercell lattice at the @xmath1 point alone and adopt the canonical ensemble scheme where the kinetic energy of the ionic motions is constantly rescaled to the simulation temperature . in the stimulated annealing mode of the md program , the force tolerance threshold is set to 0.0001 ( atomic units ) and the electronic temperature for fermi broadening to 300 k. we used sp - basis set for si and s - basis set for h. the range of repulsive potential and cut - off distance for the next nearest neighbour ( in atomic units ) respectively are 4.8 and 4.8 for si - si interactions , 3.2 and 3.2 for si - h interactions , 2.99 and 2.0 for h - h interactions .",
    "the ionic motions are calculated with discrete time steps of about 1 fs . for the generation of structures of pure and hydrogenated amorphous silicon from liquid quench",
    ", we used the dynamical method . in this method",
    "we start with crystalline sample then raise the temperature of the sample to 4000 k. the sample is then equilibrated at 4000 k for 0.5 ps to destroy the memories of its initial structure and then cooled down to 1800 k in 2 ps to form a liquid where it is equilibrated for further 2 ps . the cell is then quenched to 300 k where it is equilibrated for some more time .",
    "the samples of pure and hydrogenated amorphous silicon with 216 silicon atoms and 24 hydrogen atoms are generated within a simple cubic simulation cell of side 16.2813  .",
    "we have taken the simulation cell of size 16.2813  to have the same mass density of pure amorphous silicon sample as that of www model sample @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen atoms are added into the initial crystalline silicon by dividing the simulation cell into 27 equal cubes and placing hydrogen atoms at tetrahedral positions , one in each of 24 of the 26 outer cubes .",
    "while two samples of @xmath0-si : h are generated from the liquid quench at two different quenching rates , two more samples are generated by the hydrogenation of pure amorphous silicon samples .",
    "these samples are labelled as follows : + @xmath2 : pure amorphous silicon sample generated by using a quenching rate of @xmath3 k / s from the liquid state at 1800 k to 300 k where it is further equilibrated for 2.5 ps .",

    "k the diffusion almost ceases .",
    "therefore , to relax the structure further the temperature is raised to 1200 k , equilibrated there for 1 ps and then cooled again to 300 k at the rate of @xmath5 k / s . at 300 k ,",
    "it is equilibrated for 2.0 ps . + @xmath6 : @xmath0-si : h sample generated by using a quenching rate of @xmath5 k / s from the liquid state at 1800 k to 1200 k where it is equilibrated for 1 ps and then cooled down to 300 k at the same rate . at 300 k",
    "it is further equilibrated for 5 ps . the structure is further relaxed by raising the temperature to 1200 k where it is equilibrated for 1 ps and then cooled to 300 k at the rate of @xmath5 k / s . at 300 k",

    "+ @xmath7 : @xmath0-si : h sample generated by hydrogenation of * asi * sample of pure amorphous silicon .",
    "this is done by dividing the simulation cell into 27 equal cubes and placing hydrogen atoms at arbitrary positions in 24 of the 26 outer cubes .",
    "the resultant structure is simulated for 0.5 ps at 300 k. to increase the diffusion of atoms , the temperature is raised to 1200 k at the rate of @xmath8 k / s where it is equilibrated again for 1 ps and then cooled to 300 k at the rate of @xmath3 k / s . at 300 k",

    "_ @xcite adopting the same procedure as for csih .    to investigate the vibrational properties of the above samples , the dynamical matrix is constructed with the help of the differentiation scheme defined in eq.(9 ) with @xmath10=0.005  .",
    "the diagonalization of this dynamical matrix gives the eigenvalues ( square of vibrational frequencies ) and the eigenvectors ( vibrational patterns ) which are further used to calculate the vibrational density of states ( vdos ) and localization of vibrational modes of the model samples .",
    "the broadening width of 20 @xmath11 is used to calculate the vdos .",
    "once the information of vdos is available , it is easy to construct the temperature dependence of thermodynamic properties . in the harmonic approximation the free energy ( f ) ,",
    "entropy ( s ) and specific heat ( c ) per atom of a simulated system are calculated using expressions given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the localization behaviour of the vibrational modes is investigated by calculating the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) as given in ref .",
    "@xcite . a vibrational mode for which the participation ratio is approaching 1 will be a localized mode .",
    "for the electronic structure calculations of the above model structures , a huge memory is required .",
    "therefore , we could use the maximum of 16 k - points of the brillouin zone . for the calculation of electronic density of states we have used @xmath12 monkhorst - pack @xcite mesh of k - points .",
    "we first discuss the structural properties of the four @xmath0-si : h samples with the help of figs.1 - 5 and tables i - iii .",
    "the data , as given in these figures and tables , are the averages of 100 configurations over a time span of 0.5 ps .",
    "the pair correlation function for the pure amorphous silicon as given in fig.1 shows a good agreement with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the first peak which corresponds to the first nearest neighbours is sharp and occurs at 2.37  .",
    "however , the second and third peaks corresponding to the second and third nearest neighbours are broader . the partial pair correlation functions of si - si , si - h and h - h correlations in @xmath0-si : h samples ( asih , bsih , csih and wsih ) are given in fig.2 . in si - si and si - h pair correlation functions , the first peaks corresponding to si - si and si - h bond lengths are sharp .",
    "however , in h - h pair correlation function it is broadened and occurs above 2.0  which indicates the nonexistence of molecular hydrogen ( bond length @xmath13 1.0  ) but the hydrogen configurations with two hydrogen atoms spaced more than 2.0  apart and/ or clustering of hydrogen atoms in @xmath0-si : h .",
    "this is in agreement with the _ ab initio _",
    "results @xcite as well as the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the second and third nearest neighbour peaks in si - si and si - h correlation functions in the @xmath0-si : h sample are broader . in h - h correlation functions there is no clear peak except the first peak .",
    "the positions of main peaks in the pair correlation functions of different samples are given in table i , where the data from the previous theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies are also given for comparison .",
    "there is a good agreement between the positions of peaks in the pair correlation functions of our samples and the experimental data .    from fig.2 ,",
    "it is also clear that as far as si - si and si - h pair correlation functions are concerned all the four samples ( asih , bsih , csih and wsih ) are quite similar .",
    "this shows that si - si and si - h pair correlation functions are independent of the preparation procedure and initial structure from which the hydrogenated sample is generated .",
    "however , the h - h pair correlation functions show the dependence on preparation procedure .",
    "the overall behaviour of h - h pair correlation functions is quite similar to the experimental results @xcite .",
    "however , due to the finite size of the samples and a small number of hydrogen atoms , the statistics is not good enough to draw any general conclusion except that the distribution of hydrogen in amorphous silicon is nonuniform and depends upon the preparation procedure and initial structure from which the hydrogenated sample is generated . a small angle neutron scattering ( sans )",
    "study @xcite of nonuniform hydrogen distribution in @xmath0-si : h has also reported the existence of hydrogen heterogeneity on nanometer scale in @xmath0-si : h .    a more detailed structural description of the model samples is given by the bond length and bond angle distributions .",
    "these distributions for pure and hydrogenated amorphous silicon samples are calculated by defining the cut - off distances for si - si and si - h bondings upto the first minima in their respective correlation functions .",
    "the si - si bond length and si - si - si bond angle distributions for asi and www samples are shown in fig 3 .",
    "these distribution functions show a broad distribution with peaks respectively at around 2.37  and 106@xmath14 .",
    "the distribution functions for asi and www samples are in good agreement except some noise in the curves corresponding to www sample .",
    "this is because of the fact that for www sample only one configuration was used while for asi sample the average was taken over 100 configurations .",
    "these distributions indicate that asi sample deviates from the perfect tetrahedral network and has a distribution over bond length and bond angle .",
    "the root mean square deviations ( rmd ) of si - si bond length and si - si - si bond angle distributions in asi and www samples are 0.13  and 16.65@xmath14 , and 0.08  and 11.19@xmath14 respectively .",
    "fig.4 shows that the si - si bond length and si - si - si bond angle distribution functions in wsih sample have sharper peaks as compared to other samples .",
    "these peaks occur respectively at about 2.34  and 108@xmath14 which are quite close to the corresponding values in crystalline silicon .",
    "it indicates that the wsih sample has crystalline features which is due to the already present crystalline components in the model structure of www sample as has been shown by wooten _",
    "these distribution functions in asih , bsih and csih samples are nearly identical with a little variation in their peak heights and positions occurring at around 2.36  and 106@xmath14 respectively .",
    "thus , si - si bond length and si - si - si bond angle distributions are almost independent of preparation procedure and the initial structure from which the hydrogenated sample is generated .",
    "the rmd of si - si bond length and si - si - si bond angle distributions in asih , bsih , csih and wsih samples are 0.12  and 17.15@xmath14 , 0.11  and 17.37@xmath14 , 0.13  and 15.79@xmath14 , and 0.11  and 15.61@xmath14 respectively .",
    "the si - h bond length distributions ( see fig.5 ) are different in all the samples except that the peak occurs nearly at about 1.52  . in @xmath0-si : h samples generated from the liquid quench , this distribution is broader whereas it is sharper in the samples prepared by hydrogenation of pure amorphous silicon .",
    "this can be attributed to the stability of si - h bonding in these samples .",
    "as these distribution functions are the time averages , the broader distribution indicates that si - h bonding is unstable so that bond length has a variation over a certain range , while the narrow distribution indicates that the si - h bonding is relatively stable and there is little variation in the bond length .",
    "the comparison of the si - h bonding distributions for asih and bsih samples also shows that the distribution is sharper for bsih sample prepared by the faster quenching rate .",
    "the si - si - h bond angle distributions ( see fig.5 ) are nearly similar in all samples except that it is sharper in wsih sample .",
    "the sharper peak is due to the presence of crystalline components in the structure of wsih sample as shown above by the si - si bond length and si - si - si bond angle distribution functions given in fig.4 .",
    "thus , fig.5 indicates that while the si - h bond length distributions are dependent upon the preparation procedure as well as the initial structure from which the hydrogenated sample is generated , the si - si - h bond angle distributions are nearly independent .",
    "in addition to the 4-fold si atoms there are also 3-fold and 5-fold si atoms in our samples as given in table ii . in asi sample the average percentages of 3-fold , 4-fold and 5-fold",
    "si atoms are respectively 3.08 , 90.85 and 5.91 , while in www model these are 0.00 , 99.10 and 0.90 .",
    "upon hydrogenation , these values become nearly similar in both samples , i.e. , 2.41 , 95.52 and 2.07 in csih sample and 1.84 , 95.85 and 2.29 in wsih sample .",
    "the @xmath0-si : h samples ( asih , bsih ) generated from the liquid quench have more coordination defects ( 3-fold and 5-fold atoms ) than those ( csih , wsih ) generated by hydrogenation of pure amorphous silicon samples . thus the samples generated from the liquid quench are found to be more disordered as compared to those generated by hydrogenation of pure amorphous silicon samples .",
    "the comparison of coordination defects in asih and bsih samples shows that the sample ( bsih ) prepared by the faster quenching rate has less coordination defects than that prepared at the slower rate .",
    "the mean coordination numbers , z@xmath15 , z@xmath16 , z@xmath17 , and z@xmath18(=z@xmath15+z@xmath16 ) are given in table ii .",
    "the data available from the previous theoretical studies @xcite are also given for comparison . the total coordination number ,",
    "z@xmath18 of a si atom in all the samples is nearly equal to 4 .",
    "the z@xmath15 of a si atom in asi sample is 4.03 , which is quite close to 4.01 of www model @xcite .",
    "however , upon hydrogenation it reduces to 3.89 in both the samples ( csih and wsih ) .",
    "the z@xmath15 and z@xmath18 of a si atom in asih and bsih samples is larger than that of csih and wsih samples .",
    "this indicates that a si atom in asih and bsih samples is more over - coordinated as compared to that in csih and wsih samples .",
    "the z@xmath17 of a hydrogen atom in all the @xmath0-si :",
    "h samples is nearly equal to 1.0 which means that almost all the hydrogen atoms are bonded to silicon atoms as si - h monohydrides .",
    "this is in agreement with the vibrational spectroscopy results @xcite .",
    "further , we found that si - h monohydrides exist either as isolated si - h configurations or as the clusters of si - h monohydrides .",
    "the si - h clustering has also been observed in experiment @xcite and computer simulations @xcite .",
    "the average values of mean bond lengths ( si - si & si - h ) and mean bond angles ( si - si - si , si - si - h , si - h - si & h - si - h ) are given in table iii .",
    "the si - si bond length in asi sample is 2.38  compared to 2.35  in www model and 2.35  in crystalline silicon . in the @xmath0-si : h samples viz asih , bsih , csih and wsih , it is respectively 2.39 , 2.38 , 2.36 and 2.36  .",
    "this shows that in asih and bsih samples , the si - si bond length is nearly equal to that in the asi sample , but in other hydrogenated samples it is smaller .",
    "this decrease in si - si bond length can be attributed to the relaxation of strain associated with the weak si - si bonds upon hydrogenation .",
    "the si - h bond length in asih , bsih , csih and wsih samples is 1.56 , 1.54 , 1.53 and 1.53  respectively .",
    "the comparison of si - si and si - h bond lengths in @xmath0-si : h samples indicates that these bond lengths are larger in the samples ( asih , bsih ) prepared from the liquid quench compared to the samples ( csih , wsih ) prepared by hydrogenation of pure amorphous silicon samples .",
    "this means that the samples prepared by hydrogenation of pure amorphous silicon have less strain compared to the samples prepared from liquid quench .",
    "however , the comparison of si - si and si - h bond lengths in asih and bsih samples indicates that bsih sample has less strain compared to asih sample .",
    "the mean si - si - si bond angle in asi sample is 108.23@xmath14 compared to 109.12@xmath14 in www model and 109.47@xmath14 in crystalline silicon . in asih and bsih samples it is nearly equal to 108@xmath14 , while in csih and wsih samples it is 108.8@xmath14 .",
    "this indicates that csih and wsih samples are closer to the perfect tetrahedral network .",
    "the mean si - si - h bond angle is less than si - si - si bond angle , i.e. , 103.20 , 103.81 , 104.67 and 102.79@xmath14 respectively in asih , bsih , csih and wsih samples .",
    "this means that three si atoms bonded to a hydrogen bonded si atom have the tendency to have a planar structure .",

    "the electronic density of states shows a small energy gap at the fermi level in all of our samples which is quite typical for such model structures as has also been found in various previous theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "the total electronic density of states ( edos ) of pure amorphous silicon samples ( asi and www ) as given in fig.10 shows that there is a clear formation of a gap around the fermi level in both the samples .",
    "the general shape of edos in both the samples is almost the same except that the band gap around the fermi level is wider in www sample as compared to that in asi sample .",
    "thus there are more states in the gap region of asi sample as compared to that in www sample . as is well known , these gap states are due to the presence of coordination defects .",
    "the asi sample has about 9% coordination defects ( both 3-fold and 5-fold ) , while the www sample has only 0.1% 5-fold defects .",
    "the shape of band tails near the gap region is exponential in both of these samples .",
    "such an exponential behaviour of band tail states in amorphous silicon has also been shown by jianjun _",
    "_ @xcite and is a universal feature of amorphous semiconductors caused by the short range disorder in these materials .    the local electronic density of states of hydrogen atoms ( ldos@xmath23 ) and si atoms ( ldos@xmath24 ) and total electronic density of states ( edos ) for the @xmath0-si : h samples are given in fig.11 .",
    "for clarity we displayed them separately for each sample .",
    "in valance band region ( -10.0 - 0.0 ev ) ldos@xmath23 has a similar shape in all the samples but in the conduction band region ( 0.0 - 10.0 ev ) has a different shape for the samples ( asih , bsih ) generated from the liquid quench and for those ( csih , wsih ) generated by hydrogenation of pure amorphous silicon samples .",
    "the general shape of ldos@xmath24 at si sites and edos is almost the same in all of the four samples .",
    "the band tail states near band gap region in edos have almost the same exponential distribution as in the pure amorphous silicon sample .",
    "there is a decrease in the electronic band tail states in the gap region and increase in the energy gap around fermi level in edos in the hydrogenated samples which is consistent with the earlier studies @xcite .",
    "balamurugan and prasad @xcite also reported the increase of first excited electronic level gap in the small silicon clusters upon hydrogenation .",
    "thus hydrogenation has the tendency to remove the states from the gap region and increase the band gap .",
    "we have presented the dftb based md calculations for the sample dependence of structural , vibrational and electronic properties @xmath0-si : h . the samples of @xmath0-si : h are generated by quenching from the liquid state of silicon - hydrogen mixture and by hydrogenation of pure amorphous silicon samples .",
    "the overall structural properties of these model structures are in good agreement with the previous experimental and theoretical results .",
    "the @xmath0-si : h samples generated from the liquid quench have more coordination defects as compared to the samples generated by hydrogenation of pure amorphous silicon .",
    "the si - si and si - h pair correlations are found independent of preparation procedure and initial conditions , whereas the h - h pair correlations are sample dependent .",
    "it has been found that almost all the hydrogen atoms are bonded to silicon atoms , in si - h monohydride fashion , existing either as isolated si - h bond or as clusters of si - h bonds .",
    "the distribution of hydrogen in all the samples is found nonuniform and depends upon the preparation procedure and the initial structure from which the hydrogenated sample is generated .",
    "the si - si bond length and si - si - si bond angle distributions are nearly independent of sample preparation procedure , but si - h bond length distributions are dependent .",
    "the vibrational properties of these samples are investigated by calculating the vdos and localization of vibrational modes .",
    "the vdos of pure amorphous silicon sample is in good agreement with the experimental data . in hydrogenated samples ,",
    "there exist extra peaks in the frequency range 600 - 2200 @xmath11 which are also in reasonable accord with the experimental results . in vdos/@xmath21 versus",
    "@xmath25 plot there occurs a peak at low frequencies in all of our samples .",
    "the position and height of this peak shows no connection to coordination defects .",
    "the height of this peak also indicates that the low frequency vibrational modes are less in the samples generated by hydrogenation of pure amorphous silicon samples as compared to the other samples generated from the liquid quench . while the high frequency modes related to si - si bond vibrations are found moderately localized both in pure and hydrogenated amorphous silicon , the vibrational modes related to si - h vibrations are highly localized .",
    "the vdos is further used to calculate the temperature dependence of thermodynamic properties within the harmonic approximation .",
    "it has been found that the free energy decreases whereas the entropy and specific heat increase with increase in temperature in all samples . in @xmath0-si : h samples , the free energy is larger while the entropy and specific heat are lower than that of pure amorphous silicon sample at all the temperatures .",
    "however , the inter - comparison of @xmath0-si : h samples shows that in samples prepared from the liquid quench , the free energy is smaller whereas the entropy and specific heat are larger as compared to that of samples prepared by hydrogenation of pure amorphous silicon samples at all temperatures . at low temperatures",
    ", there exists a bump in c / t@xmath22 plots of all the samples .",
    "the height and position of this bump show no relation with the coordination defects .",
    "the electronic density of states shows a small energy gap at the fermi level in all the samples .",
    "the hydrogenation of pure amorphous silicon reduces the electronic gap states and increases the energy gap .",
    "the total electronic density of states and local density of electronic states ( ldos ) at si atom sites are nearly sample independent , while the ldos at the h atom sites is dependent on the sample preparation procedure .",
