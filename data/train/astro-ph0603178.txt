    "magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence has long been considered responsible for angular momentum transport in accretion discs surrounding astrophysical objects @xcite .",
    "strong support for the importance of magnetic fields in accretion discs followed the realization by @xcite that laminar flows with radially decreasing angular velocity profiles , that are hydrodynamically stable , turn unstable when threaded by a weak magnetic field .",
    "since the discovery of this magnetorotational instability ( mri ) , a variety of local ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) numerical simulations have shown that its non - linear evolution gives rise to a turbulent state characterized by enhanced reynolds and maxwell stresses , which in turn lead to outward angular momentum transport .",
    "the relevance of the reynolds and maxwell stresses in determining the dynamics of a magnetized accretion disc is best appreciated by examining the equation for the dynamical evolution of the mean specific angular momentum of a fluid element ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "defining this quantity for a fluid element with mean density @xmath0 as @xmath1 we can write in cylindrical coordinates @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 stand for the means and fluctuations of the velocity and magnetic fields , respectively , and the bars denote suitable averages .",
    "it is clear that the presence of mean magnetic fields or of non - vanishing correlations between the fluctuations in the magnetic or velocity field can potentially allow for the specific angular momentum of a fluid element to change . in the absence of strong large - scale magnetic fields , the last two terms on the right hand side",
    "will dominate and we can simplify equation ( [ eq : angular_momentum_mean ] ) as @xmath6 where the vector @xmath7 characterizes the flux of angular momentum .",
    "its components are related to the reynolds and maxwell stresses , @xmath8 and @xmath9 via @xmath10 it is straightforward then to see that in order for matter in the disc to accrete , i.e. , to loose angular momentum , the sign of the mean total stress , @xmath11 , must be positive .",
    "note that in the mri - literature the maxwell stress is defined as the negative of the correlations between magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "we have chosen instead to use a definition in which the sum of the diagonal terms has the same sign as the magnetic energy density .    in",
    "a differentially rotating mhd turbulent flow , the sign of the stress component @xmath11 will depend on the mechanism driving the turbulence ( presumably the mri ) , the mechanism mediating the energy cascade between different scales , and the dissipative processes that lead to saturation .",

    ", we derive analytic expressions that relate the dynamics of the mri - driven fluctuations in fourier space with the mean values , averaged over the disc scale - height , of the different stresses in physical space .",
    "this allows us to provide the first formal analytical proof showing that the mri leads to a positive mean total stress @xmath12 which , in turn , leads to a net outward transport of angular momentum . within this formalism",
    ", we demonstrate that the reynolds stress is always positive , the maxwell stress is always negative , and that the absolute value of the maxwell stress is larger than the reynolds stress as long as the flow in the absence of magnetic fields is rayleigh - stable .",
    "moreover , we uncover a robust relationship between the maxwell and reynolds stresses as well as between the magnetic and kinetic energy of the mhd fluctuations during the late times of the linear phase of the instability .",
    "specifically , we show that the ratio of the ( absolute value of the ) maxwell and reynolds stresses is equal to the ratio of magnetic and kinetic energy densities , and that both ratios depend only on the value of the local shear characterizing the flow .",

    "3 we present the complete solution to the mri - eigenvector problem in fourier space .",
    "we pay particular attention to the characterization of the complex nature of the mri - eigenvectors . in  4 , we present the formalism to derive analytic expressions for the mean physical reynolds and maxwell stresses in terms of the fluctuations in spectral space .",
    "we show that the mri leads to a net outward transport of angular momentum .",
    "we also study there the different properties of the mri - driven stresses during the late times of their exponential growth . in  5 we compare these stress properties with similar properties found in previous numerical simulations that addressed the non - linear turbulent regime using shearing boxes .",
    "we also present there our conclusions .",
    "this paper is concerned with the signature of the axisymmetric mri in the mean values ( averaged over the disc scale - height ) of the reynolds and maxwell stress tensors . in particular , we consider a cylindrical , incompressible background , characterized by an angular velocity profile @xmath13 , threaded by a weak vertical magnetic field @xmath14 . in order to address this issue , we work in the shearing sheet approximation , which has proven useful to understand the physics of disc phenomena when the scales involved are smaller than the disc radius .    the shearing sheet approximation consist of a first order expansion in the variable @xmath15 of all the quantities characterizing the flow at the fiducial radius @xmath16 .",

    "we focus our attention on fluctuations that depend only on the vertical coordinate",
    ". these types of fluctuations are known to have the fastest growth rates @xcite and will , therefore , constitute the most important contributions to the corresponding reynolds and maxwell stresses during the exponential growth of the instability .",
    "the equations governing the dynamics of these fluctuations can be obtained by noting that the velocity and magnetic fields given by @xmath26   \\check{{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$\\phi$ } } } } + \\delta v_z(z ) \\check{{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$z$ } } } }   \\ , , \\\\ \\label{eq : mean_plus_fluctuations_b } { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$b$ } } } & = & \\delta b_r(z ) \\check{{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$r$ } } } }   +   \\delta b_\\phi(z ) \\check{{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$\\phi$ } } } } +   [ \\bar b_z + \\delta b_z(z ) ] \\check{{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$z$ } } } } \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] constitute a family of exact , non - linear , solutions to the one - dimensional incompressible mhd equations in the shearing sheet limit .",
    "as noted in @xcite , the only non - linear terms , which are present through the perturbed magnetic energy density , are irrelevant in the incompressible case under study ( i.e. , the total pressure can be found _ a posteriori _ using the condition @xmath27 ) .",

    "we can further simplify the system of equations ( [ eq : euler ] ) and ( [ eq : induction ] ) by removing the background shear flow @xmath30 .",
    "we obtain the following set of equations for the fluctuations @xmath31 where the first term on the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : vy ] ) is related to the epicyclic frequency @xmath32 , at which the flow variables oscillate in an unmagnetized disc .",

    "<S> the magnetorotational instability is thought to be responsible for the generation of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence that leads to enhanced outward angular momentum transport in accretion discs . here , we present the first formal analytical proof showing that , during the exponential growth of the instability , the mean ( averaged over the disc scale - height ) reynolds stress is always positive , the mean maxwell stress is always negative , and hence the mean total stress is positive and leads to a net outward flux of angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , we show that the ratio of the maxwell to the reynolds stresses during the late times of the exponential growth of the instability is determined only by the local shear and does not depend on the initial spectrum of perturbations or the strength of the seed magnetic . </S>",
    "<S> even though we derived these properties of the stress tensors for the exponential growth of the instability in incompressible flows , numerical simulations of shearing boxes show that this characteristic is qualitatively preserved under more general conditions , even during the saturated turbulent state generated by the instability .    </S>",
