    "these authors studied a coarse - grained field theory in terms of a relativistic hydrodynamic description with viscous terms in the energy momentum tensor and the baryon current .",
    "their conclusion was that the growth rate is determined by the coefficients of the shear and bulk viscosities and that hadronic bubbles do not grow when these coefficients vanish .",

    "finally we must mention a numerical approach to the description of nucleation , based on a phenomenological _ markovian _ langevin dynamics in terms of the finite temperature effective potential ( typically computed to one loop order ) with a ( local ) friction coefficient and a gaussian white noise term related by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem@xcite .",

    "these finite temperature corrections modify quantitatively and sometimes substantially the equilibrium free energy functional , for example the position of the minima , masses and couplings .",
    "these are important parameters that determine the profile of the bubble configuration , since the asymptotic behavior of the bubble is determined by the position of the minima of the equilibrium free energy .",
    "the importance of the growth rate for describing the dynamics of nucleation in the hadronization and the electroweak phase transitions as well as the practical importance of nucleation in quasi - one dimensional organic conductors justifies a continued effort to understand from a _ microscopic _ perspective the influence of dissipation , viscosity and friction upon the growth rate of supercritical nucleating bubbles .",
    "* focus and strategy : * our goal in this article is precisely to study dissipative effects upon the growth rate @xmath18 from a more _ microscopic _ point of view in model quantum field theories that describe the main features of nucleation .",
    "the simplest model to study nucleation and a first order phase transition is a @xmath2 field theory with a small explicit symmetry breaking term that breaks the degeneracy between ground states and thus leads to the existence of a metastable state .",
    "although arguably this model could hardly describe the features of the quark - hadron or electroweak phase transitions , our hope is to extract robust phenomena that will be generic to the physics of nucleation and that could enlighten the effect of viscosity on the growth rate .",
    "the study begins by identifying the inhomogenous bubble configuration which is a solution of the static equations of motion .",
    "we include the finite temperature effects by considering the equation of motion in terms of the _ finite temperature effective potential _ ,",
    "this is achieved consistently by the addition of finite temperature counterterms to the lagrangian .",
    "the quadratic fluctuations around this bubble solution feature an unstable mode that describes small perturbations from the critical bubble .",
    "the instability is a manifestation of the growth ( or collapse ) of supercritical ( or subcritical ) bubbles and the unstable eigenvalue is directly related to the growth rate of slightly supercritical bubbles .",
    "besides this unstable mode there are modes of zero frequency corresponding to translations of this configuration and modes of positive frequency that correspond to stable fluctuations .",
    "the main strategy is to consider the dynamics of the coordinate that determines the unstable direction in functional space , and treating it as a _",
    "collective coordinate_. we then focus on the _ interaction _ of this coordinate with those representing the stable fluctuations by expanding the original lagrangian in terms of these coordinates in function space and recognize the interaction terms between these coordinates .",
    "the translational mode is anchored and ignored since we are not interested in studying the dynamics of the translational degree of freedom but that of the growth of a supercritical bubble .",
    "we assume that the stable degrees of freedom are in thermal equilibrium and that they serve as a `` bath '' with which the unstable coordinate interacts . integrating out the degrees of freedom associated with the stable fluctuations we obtain an effective description of the dynamics for the unstable coordinate which includes the `` viscosity and friction '' effects associated with the transfer of energy to the stable modes .",
    "this description allows us to obtain the equations of motion for the expectation value of the unstable coordinate wherefrom we can obtain the _ corrections _ to the growth rate from the interaction with the stable degrees of freedom .",
    "furthermore , integrating out the stable degrees of freedom in the non - equilibrium functional allows us to extract the effective langevin equation for the unstable coordinate and to obtain consistently the noise terms .",
    "we emphasize that this approach is _ fundamentally different _ from the previous studies described above .",
    "first of all , we are _ not _ computing the ratio of determinants that enter in the rate expression .",
    "this ratio of determinants only involves the quadratic fluctuations but _ not _ the interaction between the coordinates associated with the fluctuations .",
    "our approach is different from that of references@xcite , in these references the coupling of the order parameter associated with the nucleating field was to _ other independent fields_. contrary to this we consider the coupling of the unstable coordinates to the stable fluctuations involving the _ same _ field .",
    "our approach starts from the microscopic theory and does not rely on a hydrodynamic description , however as it will be seen later , long - wavelength hydrodynamic fluctuations associated with surface waves provide the largest contribution to viscosity effects in three spatial dimensions .    in a very specific sense our program obtains the effective action for the degree of freedom that represents departures from a critical bubble by integrating out the degrees of freedom describing stable fluctuations , but of the _ same field_. our approach must necessarily rely on several different approximations : i ) weak coupling to allow a perturbative expansion of the effective action and the real time equations of motion , ii ) the thin wall approximation in which the critical radius is much larger than the width of the bubble wall .",
    "this approximation is necessary to be able to provide quantitative answers .",
    "finally as it will be justified later the important fluctuations can be described by the _",
    "classical _ limit of the finite temperature distribution functions .",
    "we carry out this program to lowest order in the quartic coupling and to leading order in the thin wall approximation both in @xmath0 and @xmath1 dimensions . the motivation to study the lower dimensional case",
    "is provided by its potential application in experimentally relevant condensed matter systems@xcite .",
    "* summary of results : *    our main results can be summarized as a consistent perturbative correction to the growth rate from `` dynamical viscosity '' effects associated with the interaction of the radius of the bubble with the stable quantum and thermal fluctuations . in @xmath0 dimensions the growth rate for bubbles is given by eqn .",

    "these are identified as _ quasi - goldstone _ bosons and give the dominant contribution to viscosity effects on the growth rate .",
    "these low energy excitations are a robust feature of _ any _ model and not particular to the one considered in this article , however , the _ coupling _ of the unstable radial coordinate to these fluctuations depends on the model .",
    "to lowest order in the coupling the growth rate is given by eqn .",
    "( [ finalgrowthrate ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we obtain the effective langevin equation for the unstable coordinate that reveals the correct microscopic correlations of the noise term showing that the coupling to the hydrodynamic modes determine that the noise is correlated on time scales @xmath7 .",

    "iii the case of @xmath0 dimensions is analyzed in detail within the model considered . in section",
    "iv we study the @xmath1 dimensional case , and discuss the low energy fluctuations associated with surface waves , providing the argument that these are quasi - goldstone hydrodynamic fluctuations .",
    "we argue that these low energy fluctuations are present independent of the model and will dominate the viscosity corrections to the growth rate .",
    "the conclusions are presented in section v , along with a critical discussion on the validity of our results to describe the growth rate of supercritical bubbles in coarse - grained descriptions of a first order quark - hadron phase transition .",
    "an appendix presents the effective langevin equation for small departures of the critical radius and analyzes the generalized fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "we consider a real scalar field , @xmath21 , whose dynamics is determined by the following lagrangian density @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a double well potential with a metastable minimum at @xmath24 and a stable minimum at @xmath25 .",
    "it proves convenient to parametrize it in the following form :    @xmath26    this form of the potential is depicted in fig.([potfig ] ) and is very similar to the coarse - grained free energy proposed in@xcite identifying the local energy variable _ e _ in that reference with the scalar field @xmath27 , and also similar to the effective potential description used in numerical simulations for the electroweak theory@xcite .",
    "the stable minimum @xmath25 is given by @xmath28 where the point @xmath29 is parametrized by the mass @xmath30 of small oscillations around the _ metastable _ minimum @xmath24 as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath4 is the quartic coupling .",
    "although this parametrization does not look familiar it will prove advantageous later .",
    "in particular , @xmath33 gives a measure of the free energy difference between the true and the false vacua and is therefore related to the supercooling temperature .",
    "as @xmath34 , the two minima become degenerate and the condition @xmath35 defines the thin - wall limit ( this will become clear later when we analyze the bubble profile ) , when the radius of the nucleating bubble is much larger than the width of its surface @xmath36 ( or the correlation length ) .",
    "this corresponds to the case of small supercooling @xmath3 but @xmath37 in the description of reference@xcite . in the thin wall limit",
    ", we find that @xmath25 has the following simple form @xmath38      we anticipate that there will be renormalization of the parameters in the potential , not only arising from ultraviolet divergences but more importantly from medium effects , i.e. finite temperature contributions to the mass , couplings and explicit symmetry breaking terms .",
    "in particular in three spatial dimensions we expect a correction to the mass and the linear symmetry breaking term both proportional to @xmath39 .",
    "the origin of these finite temperature corrections are the usual tadpole diagrams , the correction to the linear symmetry breaking term is a consequence of the trilinear coupling .",
    "these finite temperature corrections are the usual ones obtained in an effective potential description and provide a finite renormalization to the potential .",
    "our aim is to describe the dynamical aspects of the thermal fluctuations that are responsible for thermal activation and the nucleation of the true phase in the false vacuum phase .",
    "these are the solutions of the static field equations but _ in presence of the thermal fluctuations _ ,",
    "i.e. with the potential renormalized by the finite temperature effects .",
    "that is to say , the potential that must enter in the field equations must be the finite temperature effective potential@xcite .",
    "the finite temperature effective potential includes the finite temperature corrections for static and homogeneous field configurations . including these finite temperature effects in the equations",
    "o f motion guarantees that the _ inhomogeneous _ bubble configurations will asymptotically tend to the homogeneous values of the field representing the _ correct _ extrema of the equilibrium free energy .",
    "furthermore , these finite temperature renormalizations will determine the _ correct",
    "_ scales for the bubble size , its width and the unstable frequency associated with the growth of a supercritical bubble .",
    "we account for these finite temperature renormalizations by replacing the parameters in the potential by the finite temperature renormalized parameters and adding counterterms to the lagrangian .",
    "the counterterms are then found consistently in a coupling or loop expansion by requesting that they cancel the contributions from the tadpole ( or similar ) terms _ completely _ , i.e. including the finite temperature parts .",
    "this prescription is at the heart of using the finite temperature effective potential to study the solutions that lead to the decay of the metastable state@xcite .",
    "thus the lagrangian density becomes @xmath40 = { 1\\over 2}(\\partial_\\mu\\phi)(\\partial^\\mu\\phi)- v(\\phi , t)+\\delta { \\cal l}_{ct}[\\phi ] \\label{counter}\\ ] ] where the potential @xmath41 is of the same form as in ( [ pot ] ) but in terms of the parameters that include the finite temperature ( and ultraviolet ) renormalizations , i.e. @xmath42 etc .",
    "and the counterterm lagrangian density is of the form @xmath43 where space - time translational invariance dictates that the counterterms are constant .",
    "these counterterms will be consistently chosen in the loop expansion to cancel the contribution from local tadpoles .",
    "we will argue below that this procedure renormalizes consistently in perturbation theory the _",
    "static _ properties of the bubble , in particular the width and radius of a critical bubble .",
    "in particular the free energy density studied in@xcite is precisely of this form with parameters that depend on temperature .    at this point",
    "we may consider adding to the counterterms a wave - function renormalization which would involve corrections for inhomogeneous configurations .",
    "a wave - function renormalization will arise at one loop order and beyond because of the trilinear coupling .",
    "however , computing this correction in the usual loop expansion around a homogeneous background is not very relevant for the bubble configuration . since our goal is to obtain the _ real time",
    "_ equations of motion for particular fluctuations around the bubble configuration , these renormalizations will arise automatically in the equations of motion obtained to one loop order .",
    "thus the counterterms that we include in the lagrangian density are only those for _ static _",
    "renormalization thus accounting for the correct scales and asymptotic values of the classical solution and obtain the equivalent of the wave - function renormalization directly from the real time evolution of fluctuations around the bubble configuration .",
    "this procedure will become clear when we obtain explicitly the evolution equations in the next sections .",
    "we will focus our attention on the cases of one and three spatial dimensions .",
    "although the case of one spatial dimension is of limited interest in particle physics , it is important in condensed matter and statistical physics of quasi - one dimensional systems@xcite .",
    "furthermore most aspects of the treatment are general and the one - dimensional case provides a somewhat simpler setting to introduce the main strategy as well as to explore the general features . the three dimensional case will be studied in detail subsequently .      before proceeding to the specific situations , we now consider general features of the bubble solutions and the quadratic fluctuations around them to focus on the precise strategy to follow .",
