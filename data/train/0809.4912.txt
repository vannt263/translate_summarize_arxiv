    "microquasars are stellar binaries with a short period in which one of the two components is a stellar - mass black - hole .",
    "the secondary component is a normal star filling its roche lobe , and loosing mass through the first lagrangian point .",
    "the ejected matter organizes itself in an accretion disk , from which jets are launched .",
    "microquasar are one piece of a chain of objects with active galactic nuclei and gamma ray bursts , sharing the same ingredients and physics ( mirabel 2004 ) .",
    "various theoretical works have been made to model the accretion disk , with the goal of reproducing the observations .",
    "the first kind of observations that is attempted to be reproduced is the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , which results from the combination of model _ components _ and the consistency with which they are combined , and the physical radiative processes occuring therein .",
    "other observables , such as for example time - lag observed in x - rays or quasi - periodic oscillations , are usually being modeled with more or less dedicated work , and reflects more the behavior of a given component ( the disk for qpos , e.g. tagger & varnire 2006 , and the jet for time - lags , see for instance kylafis et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "our own approach is the following : based on a _ consistent _ dynamical framework describing how jets are launched from a disk ( see ferreira 1997 and references therein ) , we build a microquasar model comprising an outer standard accretion disk down to a transition radius , and an inner disk from which jets are lauched , called the jet emitting disk ( jed ) .",
    "this model is a global attempt at explaining the general behavior of microquasars in all their spectral states ( see ferreira et al .",
    "2006 , petrucci et al .",
    "our goal here is to explore the richness of the solutions given by the radiative equilibrium of the jed , and produce theoretical seds that can be tested against observations .",
    "our model for microquasars is based on the theoretical framework described in ferreira et al .",
    "( 2006 , see in particular their fig .  1 ) .",
    "we model the outer standard accretion disk , from the transition radius @xmath0 onwards , with a multi - temperature blackbody spectrum , following makishima et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . in the inner jed ,",
    "comprised between the last stable orbit @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we consider a one - temperature plasma with thermal particules only , and follow mahadevan ( 1997 ) for the bremsstrahlung , esin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for the synchrotron .",
    "we approximate the compton cooling by using the parameter @xmath3 of dermer et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , which gives the mean gain of energy in a compton diffusion .",
    "we then solve the conservation of energy and the conservation of photons , assuming that in all cases , the compton intensity spectrum follows a power - law with a wien bump at high energy . in order to obtain the three parameters of the comptonized spectrum",
    ", we link the wien s bump normalisation @xmath4 and the power - law index @xmath5 ( see wardzinski & zdziarski , 2000 , equ .",
    "23 ) .    in our computations",
    "we consider two sources of photons that are being comptonized : the synchrotron self - compton on the inner jed photons ( internal compton ) , and the external compton on photons coming from the standard accretion disk , and reaching the jed .",
    "this later contribution appeared to be of central importance in some cases where the transition radius @xmath0 .",
    "the correct inclusion of these photons for the comptonization deserves a full and detailed geometrical treatment . as for now",
    ", we have simply considered that half of the photons coming from the inner radius of the standard accretion disk ( i.e. at @xmath0 ) only are seen in the jed for comptonization by hot electrons .",
    "in order to compute theoretical seds , we need to compute the radiative equilibrium of the disk .",
    "we make the hypothesis , a posteriori verified , that the total pressure is dominated by the gaz pressure .",
    "moreover , the vertical equilibrium of the disk links the temperature @xmath6 to the disk scale height @xmath7 .",
    "consequently , the cooling is only a function of @xmath8 .",
    "we compute the cooling by using the individual seds of each independant radius of the disk , and adding an advection term ( which becomes significant only at @xmath9 ) .",
    "the heating of the disk is also a function of @xmath8 only , as provided by the theoretical framework ( see combet & ferreira 2008 ) .",
    "we then solve the equation @xmath10 ( see fig  [ fig1 ] ) , where @xmath11 .    .",
    "the various cooling contributions are indicated by dots of various shapes . in orange ,",

    "the red and blue lines indicate the heating and the total cooling respectively . ]    , an internal disk radius @xmath12 , a transition radius between the standard accretion disk and the jed @xmath13 , a magnetization @xmath14 , and the sonic mach number @xmath15 , for an object with @xmath16 , an inclination angle @xmath17 and a distance of 10 kpc .",
    "the black line indicate our final sed , the jet is in red , the bremsstrahlung in orange , the standard accretion disk in blue , the external compton in cyan .",

    "the synchrotron is indicated in dashed green ( it is not counted in the final sed ) , while the ssc is shown in plain green.,title=\"fig : \" ]    interestingly , our novel accretion disk solution often leads to three solutions of the thermal equilibrium : a cold optically - thick and a hot optically - thin thermally stable ones , and one middle thermally unstable solution ( see black losanges in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . one interesting output of our model is that we are able to produce a hard x - ray spectrum even with thermal particles , and with the clear advantage of having consistently taken into account the power extracted for the jet .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "however , the jet is weakly radiative , and radiate through an unknown distribution of non - thermal particles .",
    "we thus model the jet emission by a pure synchrotron emission model , following heinz & sunyaev ( 2003 ) .",
    "we have then attempted to manually reproduce the observed sed of the galactic microquasar xte  j1118 + 480 ( see markoff et al .",

    "( 2001 ) and a hot jed disk with @xmath13 .",
    "the jet synchrotron model follows heinz & sunyaev ( 2003 ) . ]",
    "at that stage , our model can be tested against observational seds when data is available over a large frequency domain ( as shown above ) , but mostly when the object is in the so - called low / hard state .",
    "preliminary tests have shown that we can not reproduce the high / soft state because of the absence in our model of a component that can produce the hard - tail power - law observed during these stages . in the future",
    ", we will tackle this issue along with the developement of a more realistic jet emission model .",
    "our final goal is to be able to explore the hardness - intensity diagram and reproduce an hysteresis pattern .",
