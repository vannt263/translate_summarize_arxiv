    "tlps ( transient lunar phenomena , called ltps by some authors ) as we are describing them , are seen at optical wavelengths , typically during visually observations through a telescope ( sometimes photographically , discussed below ) .",
    "there is no commonly accepted physical explanation for tlps , and some authors even question if they are due to processes local to the moon at all .",
    "cameron ( 1972 ) divides tlps ( from a catalog of 771 reported events ) into four categories : `` brightenings : '' white or color - neutral increases in surface brightness , `` reddish : '' red , orange or brown color changes with or without brightening , `` bluish : '' green , blue or violet color changes with or without brightening , and `` gaseous : '' obscurations , misty or darkening changes in surface appearance .",
    "nearly all tlps are highly localized , usually to a radius much less than 100 km , often as unresolved points ( corresponding to roughly 1 km or less ) .",
    "several kinds of experiments on apollo lunar missions , both orbiting and on the surface , as well as on _ lunar prospector _ , were designed to detect and identify gasses in the tenuous lunar atmosphere , both ions and neutral species , plus decay products from associated gaseous radioactive isotopes . even though some of these spent only days or weeks operating near the moon , most observed evidence of sporadic outgassing activity , including events that seem unassociated with anthropogenic effects .",
    "( we analyze these in crotts 2007a . )    on the timescale of a decade , numerous spacecraft and humans will visit the moon again .",
    "this offers an unprecedented opportunity to study the atmosphere of the moon , but will also introduce transients from human activity that may complicate our understanding of this gas and what it can disclose regarding the lunar interior s structure , composition and evolution .",
    "we must evaluate the current results now and expand upon them rapidly to exploit our upcoming opportunity to explore the moon in its still pristine state and perhaps even exploit these still poorly understood resources .",
    "we would like to evaluate if tlps might be elevated into a tool which can be used to study other events on the moon , including outgassing , and thereby do so from earth , before the return to the moon of large spacecraft and their human crews .",
    "if tlps are real , we can study them using modern technology without depending on human event selection , but via a robotic imaging monitor that will be much more objective and probably more sensitive than historical means ( crotts 2007b , crotts et al .",
    "with the sensitivity of the human eye peering through an optical telescope , the detection of a tlp is evidently a rare event .",
    "heretofore , this has put tlp reporting largely into the category of anecdotal evidence , which in many minds makes them `` irreproducible . ''",
    "the harshest critics of the field have likened them to ufos ( unidentified flying objects ) .",
    "this is not to say that rare sightings and anecdotal evidence can not turn into real phenomena and important science e.g. , meteorites , ball lightning , the green flash , and many species of rare and interesting fauna .",
    "the debate as to the reality of tlps unfortunately has taken place in the unrefereed scientific literature .",
    "additionally , in recent years there have been examples of published , apparently positive evidence that has been later retracted .",
    "a positive treatment is found in cameron ( 1991 ) .",
    "sheehan & dobbins ( 1999 ) present a condemning case . also see haas ( 2003 ) , and lena & cook ( 2004 ) . in this paper",
    "we intend to give a fair evaluation of this situation , as quantitatively as possible given the state of the data .",
    "some systematic searches have heretofore yielded few reliable detections ; we will raise the question whether these surveys were sufficiently comprehensive to have produced a non - null result .",
    "the power of the heterogeneous sample is the much greater coverage over years and centuries compared to _ in situ _ spacecraft studies or even programmed earth - based , telescopic surveys .",
    "for now we will consider the nature of the bulk of these reports , and evaluate their utility in understanding physical phenomena .",
    "one must assume one of the following : either tlps are in part tied to physical processes local to the vicinity of the lunar surface , or they are `` false , '' either due to human misinterpretation of normal lunar appearance due to physical effects tied to terrestrial phenomena or even the delusion or fabrication of the observer .",
    "given the complexity of the data base we are considering , one might even consider a combination of all three .",
    "it is the primary task of this work to answer the question if tlps are at least consistently tied to specific sites on the lunar surface , so that one can then ask if the appearance or physics of these sites might explain tlp reports .",
    "the compilation and cataloging of tlp reports is due largely to the massive efforts of two dedicated investigators , winifred cameron ( 1978 , with 1463 events through may 1977 ) , and barbara middlehurst ( 1977a , primary from the tlp event catalog of middlehurst , burley , moore & welther 1968 , of 579 events up to 1968 october , with another 134 added by patrick moore through 1971 may ) .",
    "all but seven of cameron s were seen after the invention of the astronomical telescope , and virtually all reports after the year 1610 were telescopic ( at least 1446 of the 1456 , not counting several naked - eye observations by apollo astronauts from lunar orbit ) .",
    "most of the naked - eye reports ( without telescope ) describe bright spots on the daylit or darkside moon , often seen by several observers , and these seem possibly consistent with particularly bright examples of the kinds of spots seen in profusion with the aid of telescopes .",
    "none of these events was reported by observers in widely - separated locations , and seem to be recorded only a few times or less per century .",
    "( an example : boston , massachusetts , the evening of 1668 november 26 ; several naked - eye observers report a bright , star - like point on the dark side : middlehurst 1977a , from jocelyn 1675 . )",
    "an exceptional case is the report from 1178 june 18 by at least five observers in canterbury , england ( newton 1972 , stubbs 1879 ) , an event which hartung ( 1976 ) speculates might be the impact formation of the young crater giordano bruno , as supported by calame & mulholland ( 1978 ) searching for a source of the anomalous lunar libration , but seriously challenged by gault & schultz ( 1991 ) , withers ( 2001 ) , and unpublished work .",
    "the overwhelming majority of tlp reports involve telescopic observations , and most of these were made by amateur astronomers . during the years of the first lunar surface exploration efforts ,",
    "many sightings were made by mixed teams of professionals and amateurs , detailed in  2.4 . at times",
    "when the moon has been an attractive target of forefront research , some of the most noted and experienced observers have reported tlps .",
    "( middlehurst 1977a gives a separate summary of this early period of tlp reports . )   wilhelm herschel , the only human to discover a planet on the basis of solely visual telescopic observation , reported tlps on at least 6 occasions between 1783 and 1790 , primarily bright , point - like spots , many of them red in color ( middlehurst 1968 ) .",
    "clyde tombaugh , discoverer of the dwarf planet 134340 pluto , along with at least five other observers spread across the united states , reported on 1963 november 28 `` reddish - orange and sparkle '' activity on the rim of aristarchus , which some observers saw followed by a faint blue glow on the crater floor ( cameron 1978 ) .",
    "charles messier , discoverer of 19 comets and author of the famous catalog of nebulae , saw tlps on one occasion ( `` moving glows '' during a lunar eclipse : cameron 1978 ) in 1783 , and ernst tempel ( discoverer of 20 or more comets ) at four epochs from 1866 - 1885 .",
    "tlps were also reported by noted observers edward barnard ( in 1889 - 1892 ) , edmond halley ( in 1715 ) , johann bode ( in 1788 - 1792 ) , george airy ( in 1877 , and confirmed independently ) , heinrich olbers ( in 1821 ) , dominique cassini in 1671 - 1673 ( paris observatory director and grandson of jean - domenique cassini ) , camille flammarion ( in 1867 - 1906 ) , william pickering ( perhaps the first to place a tight astrophysical limit on the moon s atmospheric mass ) in 1891 - 1912 , johann schrter in 1784 - 1792 ( first to notice the phase anomaly of venus ) , friedrich von struve ( in 1822 ) , francesco bianchini ( in 1685 - 1725 ) , etienne trouvelot ( in 1870 - 1877 ) , and more recently zdenk kopal ( in 1963 ) and in 1948 - 1967 , sir patrick moore ( middlehurst 1977a , cameron 1978 ) .",
    "of course , in 1821 - 1839 franz von gruithuisen reported luminous and obscured spots on the moon , yet also wrote about the moon being inhabited and dotted by cities !",
    "( he was also first to conclude that lunar craters result from meteorite impacts . )",
    "several reports by simultaneous but geographically well - separated observers of the same events on the lunar surface are recorded e.g. , 1895 may 2 , for 12 - 14 min on the floor of crater plato , brenner reported a streak of light , while ( independently ? ) fauth reported bright , parallel bands .",
    "cameron ( 1991 ) describes the observations by greenacre and barr on 1963 october 30 of several reddish spots that appeared for several minutes in aristarchus and near schrter s valley , and were also seen by other observers .",
    "similar events occurred one month later ( see above ) in the same vicinity ; both cases roughly coincident with local sunrise .",
    "apollo astronauts cernan , schmidt , mattingly , aldrin , collins ( and armstrong ? ) all reported tlps from lunar orbit , on four occasions .",
    "three of these were rapid flashes that have been hypothesized to result from cosmic rays entering their visual system , but on _ apollo 11 _ , aldrin and collins reported a strange darkside surface appearance ( jones 1969 ) during a 1 - 2 minute period in which ground - based observers saw a similar phenomenon at likely the same location ( cameron 1978 ) .",
    "we discuss this singular case in detail in appendix i.      there are at least nine events noted by cameron ( 1978 )",
    "as having been photographed , the earliest from 1953 november 15 .",
    "many of these are unpublished , but there are some dramatic exceptions .",
    "on 1956 october 26 , d.  alter ( 1957 ) took a careful sequence of photographs on mt .",
    "wilson observatory 60-inch of the craters alphonsus and arzachel , in infrared ( kodak i - n emulsion ) and blue - violet ( ii - o ) light , which allow a differential measurement of the imaging properties in time and wavelength between the two craters .",
    "there is a perhaps convincing , apparent obscuration of the floor of alphonsus not seen later in time or in arzachel , and that is apparent in the violet but not infrared as if some scattering cloud is present .",
    "a similar effect in crater purbach was photographed on 1970 april 14 by osawa but not published ( cameron 1978 ) . on 1959 january 23 , alter recorded ( but never published ) a photograph of a bright blue glow on the aristarchus floor , which then turned white .",
    "two unpublished event photographs ( # 876 and # 1145 in cameron 1978 ) are claimed to show red spots in craters aristarchus and maskelyne , respectively , with the former event apparently confirmed by separate visual observers .",
    "two other unpublished photographs involve brightenings of aristarchus .",
    "more recently cameron ( 1991 ) presents fairly dramatic photographs of a glowing , reddish - gray patch moving on the floor of crater piticus , as observed by g.  slayton on 1981 september 5 .",
    "finally , during a polarimetric program at lobservatoire de paris for lunar surface texture analysis , dollfus ( 2000 ) caught on 1992 december 30 a brightening in the center of crater langrenus , and with it an associated increase in the degree of polarization .",
    "similar polarimetric changes were recorded on at least two occasions in aristarchus , but the timescale is unclear ( dzhapiashvili & ksanfomaliti 1962 , lipsky & pospergelis 1966 ) .",
    "we will discuss spectroscopic and polarimetric observations in paper ii , and several probable meteoritic impact photographs in  2.5 below .",
    "several programs , primarily by groups of amateur astronomers but sometimes involving professional researchers , have made organized observations of the moon with the goal of constructing scientifically more useful datasets in attacking the tlp problem .",
    "several of these have been organized by d.  darling and collaborators , often in connection with alpo ( association of lunar and planetary observers : http://labbey.com/alpo/lunar.html and http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/rhill/alpo/lunar.html ) and now with the baa ( british astronomical association : http://www.britastro.org/baa/ and http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/acc/ ) .",
    "a summary of activities until fairly recently is found at http://www.ltpresearch.org/. ( other groups can also be found at http://www.glrgroup.org/. )   an informal appraisal of the information from these groups indicates that observers in these programs are patrolling for tlps at the level of order 100 h per year .",
    "a summary follows of some of these past efforts bearing on the purposes of this paper .",
    "* operation moon blink * ( august 1964 - april 1966 ) : w.  cameron ( 1966 ; cameron & gilheany 1967 ) of nasa goddard sfc organized a network of professional and amateur observatories spanning the contiguous united states and provided 12 of them with an instrument designed to be particularly sensitive to transient sources , particularly anomalously - colored ones , on the lunar surface .",
    "several more observers were engaged in an alert follow - up network using more conventional visual and photographic techniques .",
    "the moon - blink apparatus consisted of an s-20 photocathode image tube with a rotating filter wheel cycling between a red filter ( similar to wratten 29 ) and blue ( like wratten 44a ) at an adjustable rate of 4 - 12 hz .",
    "the video output was then monitored visually for any blinking sources .",
    "this device was particularly sensitive to color changes , shown by tests to be limited at the 0.02 mag level to changes in color index , but relatively insensitive to color - neutral brightenings , dimmings and obscurations . during the survey",
    "25 events were reported , 14 of which were detected as color changes .",
    "no total observing time estimate was published , but of order 1000 - 2000 hours was devoted to the blink portion ( cameron 2006 ) .",
    "eight of these were actual color blink events .",
    "two of these ( one of the blink events ) were confirmed by other means , but most events were reported by a team of observers at a single site .",
    "observations were concentrated on small areas , particularly aristarchus , and the fields of view varied with a selection of different telescopes above 15-inch diameter .",

    "the field - of - view was 0.1 degree .",
    "( there is a reference to `` man - hours '' of observation , so perhaps the time coverage is two or three times less than this . )   during this time , there was only one transient event reported in their publications , a large - scale violet excess just prior to the lunar eclipse of 1967 april 24 , not even classified as a tlp for the purposes of this paper .",
    "several tlp alerts by outside observers were transmitted to corralitos observatory during the events , and apparently most of these were negative confirmations .",

    "indeed , an array of telescopes with optical ccd imagers and diameters up to 1 m observed the impact with negative results ( ehrenfreund 2006 ) . in the near ir , however , the situation was much different : as yet unpublished results ( veillet 2006 ) from a 10  s exposure using the wircam infrared imager on the 3.6  m canada - france - hawaii telescope at the time of impact show a signal so bright that it saturated the detector in a 32 nm band at the 2.122  @xmath6 m molecular h@xmath7 s(1 ) 1@xmath80 transition .",

    "there is also a luminous debris cloud spreading elongatedly starting at @xmath01 km s@xmath4 ( even though the bright impact source was nearly point - like ) , as evident on the subsequent images , and which likely carried a large fraction of the energy and largely disappeared over 150 s.    the _ smart-1 _",
    "impact was very atypical of a meteoroid impact , since not only was it much slower but impacted at an angle of only @xmath15 with respect to the horizon .",
    "furthermore , the impactor consisted not only of spacecraft structure but significant amounts of hydrazine , which probably broke down immediately into atomic and molecular n and h ( and perhaps nh@xmath16 ) and charged states thereof , possibly adding considerably to the specific wavelength band chosen for the cfht detection ( but also possibly to balmer and paschen lines in the optical and near ir accessible to si ccds , and even compounds with regolith material , predominantly o , e.g. , near ir / optical meinel bands of oh ) .",
    "note as well that the impact at 1.7 km s@xmath4 of the 158-kg _ lunar prospector _ into a permanently shadowed polar crater produced no unambiguous detection in the optical or radio ( barker et al .  1999 ,",
    "berezhnoy et al .",
    "these suggest that further studies of meteoritic impacts on the moon might benefit from use of an ir camera system .",
    "this is supported by the recent presentation ( svedhem 2006 ) showing similar results for the impact of the spacecraft @xmath17 near crater stevinus on the daytime nearside highlands .",
    "the spacecraft of mass 143 kg struck at 2.323.km s@xmath4 at 48@xmath2 from vertical , with kinetic energy of @xmath18 erg .",
    "d.  allen used the aat to observe the impact at 2.16  @xmath6 m wavelength and recorded an event fluence corresponding to @xmath19 erg in a 1% wavelength band , appearing 6 - 16 s after impact no immediate optical flash was seen and later optical signals ( 15 min after impact ) were unclear , and not near the original impact point .",
    "svedhem likewise concludes that emission from the 1 kg of hydrazine onboard is likely an important part of the infrared source ; this may be a key difference between these spacecraft impacts and meteoritic impacts in the infrared .",
    "regardless of the details of the above , it is clear that the great majority of tlp reports are not impact events .",
    "even if very large impacts can produce events of sufficiently long duration , it is clear from model computation e.g. , morrison et al .",
    "( 1993 ) that the fresh impacts seen in _ clementine _ and other data sets can not sustain such activity .      since meteoritic impact can not be the cause of transient on the timescales seen in the great majority of tlps , we can expect that the spatial distribution might be expected to carry detailed information about the tlp mechanisms ( if observer selection effects can be removed ) .",

    "we will return to this discussion after we deal with at least some aspects of observer selection effects .      to make further progress in understanding the spatial distribution of tlps",
    ", we must deal statistically with the horrendous selection effects introduced into these data by the patterns and biases of the observers , most of whom never intended that their reports form part of a statistical database .",
    "our task is not modest ; we are basically trying to calibrate for this purpose all of the observations made ( or not made ) of the moon by all of the human eyeballs over a period of centuries .",
    "how do we possibly deal with the historical and even psychological issues that these effect imply , as well as the physical / mathematical ones ?",
    "this is the major burden of the current paper ; nonetheless , there are some regularities that we might exploit .",
    "there are many works on selenography , but in general , there were some systematic naked - eye observations of the moon starting in europe in the 14001500 s , and much earlier in china ( but i find no early chinese reports of tlps ) .",
    "observations greatly increased in number and detail in the mid 17th century after the invention of the telescope , and early in the next century it was appreciated that the moon needed to be observed more often due to the effects of libration . still , it does not seem that attention focussed solely on the limb regions , as mapping the moon increased in detail generally , with the adoption of lunar coordinates by mid - to - late 18th century . from late-1700 s to early 1900 s , visual mapping of the entire moon was an active science , perhaps with some concentration on terminator regions in order to better sense relative elevations of lunar features . by the turn of the 20th century",
    ", visual observation was increasingly replaced by photography , which had the unfortunate effect of suppressing sensitivity to tlps due to the decreased observational sampling cadence of photographic plates with respect to the human eye , as well as the loss of prompt color information .",
    "i speculate that for this reason , reports of tlps by professional astronomers began to die out .",
    "it is not the purpose of this paper to dwell on the history of tlp observations beyond gaining some insight into the statistical sampling structure and false report rate of the catalogs .",
    "shortly , we will move on to questions more objectively dependent on the physics of the lunar surface .",
    "there is a pause in the frequency in tlp reports in both the cameron ( 1978 ) and middlehurst ( 1968 ) catalogs , and indeed the break in reports 1927 - 1931 divides the middlehurst catalog at the median epoch in the catalog . for the post-1930 half of the sample , 2/3 of the reports come after 1955 , at which time tlps become much more commonly known and observing pattern appear to change , as we will describe later .",
    "for now we will concentrate awhile on the pre-1956 and particularly the pre-1930 period .",
    "it is obvious in regard to tlps that a most unusual area is the aristarchus plateau , including the crater aristarchus itself , the adjacent crater herodotus , and vallis schrteri ( schrter s valley ) flowing from `` cobra s head '' ( `` cobra - head '' ) , together occupying the southeasternmost @xmath010,000 km@xmath20 of the @xmath050,000 km@xmath20 plateau in the midst of the huge ( @xmath21 km@xmath20 ) mare region oceanus procellarum .",
    "( vallis schrteri was once selected as the landing site for apollo 18 , later cancelled along with apollos 19 and 20 . )",
    "aristarchus is among the brightest lunar craters , sometimes _ the _ brightest , sometimes visible to the unaided eye from earth , as noted as far in the past as the tang dynasty ( 618  907 a.d./ce ) ( mayers 1874 ) .",
    "it is also one of the freshest : @xmath22 my old , along with copernicus , kepler and tycho ( each producing less than 5% of the tlp reports of aristarchus . at one time",
    "the region was intensely active with volcanic flows and eruptions , and many sinuous rilles remain , likely old lava channels , including the most voluminous on the moon , schrter s valley .    even more than copernicus , aristarchus is singular in standing in such contrast to the surrounding dark mare background , although this is not true of vallis schrteri / cobra s head or herodotus also on the plateau .",
    "the aristarchus region is responsible for @xmath050% of the visual tlp reports ( but also likely receives a large fraction of the observing attention ) . as reviewed in ( crotts 2007a ) , however , the aristarchus plateau is also responsible for undeniably objective lunar anomalies of a transient nature associated with lunar outgassing .",
    "we will use aristarchus as a proxy to trace how astronomers have observed tlps , and whether these observations have influenced each other during different historical periods thereby producing correlated observations , rather than reports that can be counted individually .",
    "i can not presume to appreciate the observing motivations of astronomers from centuries , but prior to the year 1956 there appears to be little writing labeling special sites such as aristarchus as targets of particular popular or professional attention in terms of tlps .",
    "aristarchus received closer scrutiny in 1911 with r.  wood indicating that it might contain high concentrations of sulfur , but this did not produce a spate of aristarchus tlp reports .",
    "indeed , wood discusses vulcanism in the context of aristarchus ( sometimes known as `` wood s spot '' ) and seems unaware of the number of tlp reports in the vicinity ( wood 1911 ) .",
    "furthermore , birt ( 1870 ) and whitley ( 1870 ) provide a historical overview ( 17871880 ) of visual observations of aristarchus ( and herodotus ) while conducting a spirited debate about the nature of features including possible changes in their appearance .",
    "they mention small , possible changes , but give them no special significance , nor mention anything that today we might refer to as a recognized tlp phenomenon ( or at least a human tendency to report tlps ) .",
    "a different statement is made by elgers ( 1884 ) , who again reviews aristarchus , herodotus and the surrounding plateau .",
    "while he does not mention anything like tlps , he makes a telling statement : `` although no part of the moon s visible surface has been more frequently scrutinized by observers than the rugged and very interesting region which includes these these beautiful objects , selenographers can only give an incomplete and unsatisfactory account of it ... '' by 1913 , however , there appears to be some scholarly awareness of reported activity at aristarchus ; witness the summary ( maunder 1913 ) of reports by herschel that he `` thought he was watching a lunar volcano in eruption '' , and by molesworth and goodacre who `` each on more than one occasion , observed what seemed to be a faint bluish mist on the inner slope of the east wall ... for a short time .",
    "other selenographers too , on rare occasions , have made observations accordant with these , relating to various regions on the moon . ''",
    "maunder balances this with skepticism e.g. , `` one of the most industrious of the present - day observers of the moon , m.  philip fauth , declares that as a student of the moon for the last twenty years , and as probably one of the few living investigators who have kept in practical touch with the results of selenography , he is bound to express his conviction that no eye has ever seen a physical change in the plastic features of the moon s surface '' ( citing fauth 1909 . )",
    "the periods covered by these papers are particularly telling in understanding the nature of human behavior over the changing technological state - of - the - art in the historical course of selenography . a paper by w.h .",
    "pickering ( 1892 ) asks `` are there present active volcanos upon the moon ? '' and does a quantitative study of candidate volcanoes on the moon , merging two lists with a total of 67 craters , and then discussing in turn many of the 32 craters common to both lists .",
    "most of these are then eliminated for various reasons , then he starts discussing the rest in turn .",
    "while aristarchus is mentioned , it is discounted as being a non - volcano , while several other features are taken much more seriously ( bessel , linn and plato ) , and there is _ no _ discussion of any activity that we would call tlps today , only the long - timescale appearance or permanent changes .",
    "pickering described several tlp reports shortly before and then after submitting this paper  statistically marginal in themselves , 14 in our sample , and 9% of aristarchus and vicinity  but i see no significant evidence that these induced a spate of further aristarchus reports , at least until publication of his book [ 1904a ] , and probably not even then .",
    "this was rather late in the pre-1930 period , anyway ( which we investigate more quantitatively below ) .    as is the case for the whole sample , we should search the aristarchus reports for observers e.g. , bartlett , who produce obvious statistically descrepant results . with 150 reports total for aristarchus ,",
    "pickering should be considered as a marginal candidate for this .",
    "his series of 14 reports from 1891 - 1898 refer to mists or nebulosity in the herodotus / cobra head vicinity east and north of aristarchus ( pickering 1900 ) .",
    "personally , i suspect that at least some of these reports were erroneous , due pickering s tendency to overinterpret observations according to his lunar world view . if these were inconsistent with other observers body of reports and the catalog as a whole , and might be considered a candidate for exclusion . in truth",
    "there are contemporaneous reports e.g. , molesworth and goodacre in 1895 - 1897 ( goodacre 1899 , 1931 ) describing mists and darkening nebulosities around aristarchus .",
    "goodacre and molesworth were based in britain and what was then ceylon , and it is not apparent that they were influenced by pickering . strictly speaking we can not exclude the pickering observations because of an inconsistency .",
    "pickering exhibited a tendency to interpret changes in the lunar surface in terms of weather and biology , but his statements regarding these issues indicate that his statements are not motivated ideologically , but by the best description of observation e.g. , pickering ( 1904b , 1916 ) . in the end",
    "the pickering subsample has little effect on the overall qualitative behavior of the aristarchus dataset anyway , so i leave it intact .    to consider the questions above more systematically , i make use of abstract / article search engines . a search of the astrophysics data system ( ads ) astronomy and physics archive before 1930 , in the title or abstract , for `` volcano '' and ( not or ) `` aristarchus '' produces no matches , whereas `` aristarchus '' alone produces 4 matches ( not counting the ancient greek astronomer aristarchus ! ) and `` volcano '' alone produces 13 relevant to the moon .",
    "note that this search does not go into the body ( versus the abstract ) of the text of some longer articles , for example wood 1911 , but perhaps this is a satisfactory reflection of the amount of attention that a tlp - like claim might attract . similarly results are found for `` gas , '' `` atmosphere , '' `` eruption , '' `` flash , '' `` cloud , '' `` nebulosity , '' `` mist , '' `` geyser , '' and `` vapo(u)r , '' with no matches for any of these with `` aristarchus . ''",
    "these results are summarized in table 2 .",
    "likewise , replacing `` aristarchus '' with `` herodotus '' or various versions of schrter s valley or cobra s head produce no matches with the above terms for potentially tlp - like phenomena , or any articles which described tlps .",

    "five involve some of the tlp - related search terms that we have used . during this period tlps",
    "are firmly fixed in many people s minds when discussing particular lunar features , such as aristarchus .",
    "these papers ( or lack thereof ) can be considered an `` integral constraint '' on the importance of observer preconception as to the existence of tlps as an important factor ( for aristarchus , at least ) in determining the observation selection function ; furthermore , before 1956 they provide no evidence for a `` hysteria signal '' of false reports due to special attention . before 1956",
    "tlp reports can be considered single , largely uncorrelated events , and this partially justifies treating them with poisson statistics .",
    "this also implies that there must be some other reason that reports occur more frequently at aristarchus , by several orders of magnitude above what the area ratio of @xmath23 km@xmath20 to the near side surface of @xmath24 km@xmath20 would imply .",
    "the elgers statement above implies that the ratio of observing time per area for aristarchus and the plateau versus other areas not near the limb is at least of order unity , and probably more .",
    "however , in crotts ( 2007a ) we will see on the basis of alpha particle transients from outgassing seen by apollo and _ lunar prospector _ that tlps are correlated with @xmath25rn production and that this can not with any reasonable probability imply that tlps occur over the entire moon at the rate reported near aristarchus ( and hence we are not simply being fooled because human observers spend more time looking at the aristarchus plateau ) .",
    "aristarchus is intrinsically more prone to tlps , for some reason other than how often people observe it .",
    "while tlps at aristarchus events seem to be uncorrelated at least for aristarchus and for the period 1956 and before , we do not have sufficient statistics for lesser tlp sites to perform the same tests .",
    "i will simply assume that all events are poisson .",
    "i have not addressed how many reports are erroneous , and can not without more information about the tlp mechanism .",
    "what i can address , however , is whether tlp report rates for various features behave in statistically consistent manner . in other words ,",
    "what fraction of all reports is most justified for a particular lunar feature , and is this fraction robust against changing a particular variable ?",
    "we will choose variables which should be entirely unrelated to the conditions of the lunar surface , but might might be tell - tale of other influences , for example : `` irrelevant '' observer characteristics e.g. , where they live , or when they live .",
    "if the tlp rate for a lunar feature depends on the location of the observer , this may say more about the observational process than the physics of the moon .",
    "if the tlp rate for a feature depends on the historical period of observation , this may imply changing influences on the observer ( or it may indicate simply that certain sites are more active at some time than at other , on historical timescales ) .",
    "nonetheless , it may be instructive to construct a `` robust '' map of where on the moon tlps are reported to originate .",
    "such a robust fraction for a feature is constructed by picking an ostensibly random parameter ( as it relates to lunar surface behavior ) , and then grouping tlp reports according to various ranges in this parameter s value .",
    "the robust fraction is computed by an average ( usually not the mean ) according to some robust estimator e.g. , the median .",
    "the simplest robust estimate to construct is perhaps the median over historical periods .",
    "one - third ( 137 , exactly ) of unculled reports occur during the period 1892 - 1955 , with a roughly equal number before ( 134 ) and then after ( 145 ) . the resulting count as a function of feature - labelled `` pixel , '' analogous to table 1 ( except that on average the current values are three times smaller ) , is given in table 5 .",
    "specifically , we bin the counts seen in figure 1 into 300 km square `` pixels '' and take the median count for each pixel from the three epochs .",
    "since each pixel can be labeled with the name of the feature(s ) identified by the observers in the reports that filled that pixel , we can list the corrected count for each feature or group of features . within each pixel",
    ", we re - evaluate particular features to see if tlps from the two samples truly correspond geographically . if tlps occur in the same named feature ( and we include any positional information available ) , or within a 50 km radius of each other , or within 1.5@xmath26 the radius of the named crater , whichever is larger , we retain this as a match .",
    "the latter is a rejection consideration in less than 10% of the cases .",
    "this resulting count from this entire procedure is likely to be much more robust against selection biases than the distribution in table 1 , or for that matter similar plots shown by previous authors who did not impose an artifact rejection algorithm .",
    "i am assuming in effect that there are quantitatively different observing strategy results during these two time periods , which are capable of producing spurious peaks in the geographic distribution of reports , but do not completely neglect any area of the nearside moon , excepting geometric effects such as limb foreshortening or lunar phase selection due to evening / morning viewing times , which are independent of time when averaged over the libration period ( between one day and one sidereal month ) .",
    "my appraisal of the literature is that this is probably a good assumption .",

    "alphonsus , in particular , was one of the features that attracted greatest attention following the report of alter ( 1957 ) and kozyrev .",
    "many of the observers in these latter reports were obviously aware of previous observations , and in many cases were specifically targetting the crater because of this .",
    "plato is a distinct , flooded crater on the northwestern edge of mare imbrium , near mountainous regions such as montes alps , and appears very dark in comparison .",
    "it can be striking in its long shadows stretching across its face when near the terminator .",
    "some observer descriptions sound suspiciously like reports of this normal activity , but most do not correspond to normal appearance ( see haas 2003 ) . in 1854 - 1889",
    "there were four reports involving at least some experienced observers noting extremely bright point sources that appeared for 30 min up to 5 h ( the longest duration report we consider here ) ; it is unclear if these reports might have influenced each other .",
    "there are few reports involving red sources ( three not during eclipse ) ; there are many reports of cloud - like appearance .",
    "mare crisium varies significantly in strength between this and the raw result , and as we will see , between the different robustness estimates .",

    "this is not a scientific investigation but an essay in a popular magazine , and is effective as such .",

    "having laid criticism upon the tlp reports themselves , we consider these and other possible objections with an open and critical eye , in order to understand what may be occurring and whether we should believe it involves phenomena arising near the lunar surface .    as treated above , any reasonable test of the bartlett sample against the larger tlp data base is likely to conclude that they are not both both chosen from the same parent distribution .",
    "one needs to hypothesize a different mechanism to explain this sample than the one for other tlps , and this can not possibly be due to processes local to the moon .",
    "we will not consider here the first two cases in ( 1 ) , since they are statistically insignificant .",
    "the effect in ( 2 ) is accurately calculated given the report time , and latitude , longitude and elevation of the observer , to a high degree of accuracy .",
    "sheehan & dobbins applies the effects of dispersion to the particular case of greenacre & barr , but it is unconvincing since ( a ) the same candidate event was reported by observers two time zones away , where the airmass was much different , and ( b ) the scale and direction of the dispersive color separation corresponds only loosely to the reported observations . to elaborate on the second point , at the time of observation ( 1963 october 30 , 01:50 ut at mid - tlp ) , the moon was approaching full at 11.9 days age , so that aristarchus was illuminated with the sun about @xmath33 above the horizon producing some shadows , cast to the wnw in lunar coordinates . from the observer",
    "s viewpoint the moon was at @xmath34 zenith distance , with a parallactic angle of @xmath35 dispersing red light ( 7000 ) relative to the eye s sensitivity peak ( @xmath05000 ) 1.4 arcsec to the ene in lunar coordinates .",
    "this is roughly the direction that would be needed to disperse the illuminated rim of aristarchus into shadow for red wavelengths , in the location observed ( to the sw of the crater ) .",
    "what is not apparent is that a @xmath36 displacement can produce the extended region described , or the flux enhancement noted as `` brilliant '' .",
    "does this mechanism explain the production of red tlps , statistically ?",
    "there are 26 cases describing red or pink color , not during an eclipse , and for which there is sufficiently accurate data to calculate a useable airmass .",
    "the zenith distances for these reports , taken at mid - tlp observation , range from @xmath37 to @xmath38 , with a median of @xmath39 , producing a dispersive displacement between 5000  and 7000  of @xmath40 to @xmath41 , median of @xmath42 ( or slightly less since we do not correct for site elevation ) .",
    "subarcsecond displacements in the red , as most of these are , seem unlikely to produce an observable effect .",
    "since the moon never reaches more than @xmath43 from the celestial equator , and most of these observing sites are far to the north ( @xmath44 to @xmath45 latitude , with a heavy concentration to larger values ) , one would expect few observations at zenith distance under @xmath46 .",
    "there is no particular tendency for red events to favor high airmass .",
    "this explanation also has an intrinsic timescale of about 1 - 3 hours , which is much longer then the reported timescale of at least 70% of tlps .",
    "it is difficult to imagine a consistent source of modulation 10 - 100 times faster . in",
    "their book sheehan & dobbins ( 2001 ) hypothesize a very rare phenomenon relating to winter atmospheric considerations ( that i am not sure i have experienced in thousands of hours of observing , both with ccds and visually ) , but there is very little seasonal dependence in the red / pink tlp reports ( jan . : 3 , feb . : 7 , mar . : 5 , apr . : 4 , may . : 4 , jun . :",

    "7  almost completely in the northern hemisphere , or suffering from `` bolivian winter '' in the north - central andes ) . also , sheehan & dobbins ( 1991 ) argue against a symmetric production by atmospheric dispersion of blue tlps , which should be displaced even more ( by about 20% ) ; i do not find their argument convincing but will not pursue this here .",
    "this leaves objection # 5 : effects of seeing in high contrast source distributions , and # 3 : the absence of positive detections in the corralitos observatory survey , the largest , probably most objective tlp search .",
    "considering seeing , this depends on the perception by the human visual system which is hard to quantify without extensive psychological / physiological tests , which are beyond the scope of this paper . from my own observational experience ,",
    "i think that an experienced human observer would not be fooled by such an effect , whereas a novice observer might be ( see also haas 2003 ) .",
    "this is particularly worrisome since this effect might be particularly in play at regions of high surface brightness contrast , like the mare / highland interface , or indeed at the crater aristarchus .",
    "( one might even worry that some inexperienced observers , noticing aristarchus for the first time , might report a tlp ; there appear to be a few reports consistent with this . )",
    "this does not explain why tlps do not tend to be seen associated with many small , bright points , usually fresh impact craters , across the otherwise flatter mare visual field .",
    "an electronic survey , using ccd or cmos imaging detectors , could easily make these effects moot , using established analysis techniques to compensate for seeing variations .",
    "we discuss this in detail in paper iii .",
    "the corralitos observatory tlp survey spent some 8000 hours ( 10.9 months at full duty cycle ) observing , and was capable of covering the whole moon in 15 min ( although it is unclear if it always did ) , hence should have produced some @xmath47 whole - moon epochs .",
    "what intrinsic event rate for tlps should we assume ?",
    "as stated above , we might infer a rate of about once per month .",
    "given the structure of the distribution of observed tlp timescales , about 30% of the reports in the catalog would be missed .",
    "if the corralitos setup was equally sensitive as the typical tlp observer at large , the absence of tlps detected by them in the untriggered survey might correspond to a @xmath48 negative fluctuation ( about 0.02% poisson  not gaussian  random probability ) in the expected counts _ if _ observations were made at 100% efficiency ( which is unrealistic ) .",
    "how sensitive was the corralitos survey ?",
    "this is an important question that would have quantitative implications if we knew the flux distribution function for tlps , which we do not .",
    "still , the corralitos was probably at least as sensitive as the typical tlp observer and probably more so , so they should access at least the same event rate .",
    "the claimed sensitivity of the survey method seems improbably good : better than a 5% change in intensity in a 100  band ( dunlap & hynek 1973 ) , corresponding to 0.5%-1% in a typical broad band characteristic of a photometric optical color such as those employed , which then is converted to a monochromatic , blinking contrast difference which is monitored by the eye .",
    "this seems to be several times more sensitive than the threshold for the eye detecting a constant monochromatic contrast , but the intent was apparently to improve this threshold by causing the spot to blink at rate of a few hz .",
    "this may work for short periods of time , but the response of the eye to such a signal fatigues over time in a manner that is most significant at rates of about 12 hz ( kanai & kamitani 2003 ) .",
    "hynek et al .",
    "did their work before this effect had been studied scientifically and it is unclear how they might have adjusted their observing procedure to correct for this or perform tests to gauge the importance of such effects .",
    "the likely effects of fatigue would need to be evaluated by reconstructing the original setup of the corralitos display equipment and this is difficult to pursue . in principle",
    "the same evaluation should be made of moon blink .    particularly concerning",
    "are the tlp reports promptly transmitted to corralitos observatory during the tlp patrol to provide confirmation or lack thereof .",
    "cameron ( 1978 ) lists 25 events that were apparently negative ( four where this is stated explicitly in terms of the data ) , two of these originating with bartlett are not included in our analysis , and two ( # 1119 and # 1150 ) where apparently cameron disagrees with hynek et al .  and concludes there was a positive confirmation .",
    "this fraction of non - confirmation might lead one to conclude that many tlp reports are not objectively real , at least in the midst of intensive campaigns like those underway when these reports were produced ( april 1966 - june 1969 ) .    despite the dedicated and laudable progress made by cameron , middlehurst , moore , darling and centuries of researchers and observers , the current state of the dataset resists application of the scientific method to the problem of transient lunar phenomena .",
    "there are striking examples of several well - documented cases where tlps are confirmed and suggest connection to physical mechanisms , but the strongest evidence is anecdotal and leaves insufficient permanent records to allow the testing and elaboration of hypotheses .",
    "given the transient nature of tlps and state of available technology heretofore , this outcome was difficult to avoid .",
    "the onus of the argument must burden those who would convince us that tlps are real .",
    "when it comes to locating a spurious effect that might explain the bulk of tlp reports as unrelated to the vicinity of the moon , absence of evidence is not evidence of absence . given the inability heretofore to test a reported tlp in a timely manner with sufficiently complementary measurements , we must ask if any other physical effects firmly tied to the lunar environment are correlated with tlps .",
    "a investigation by cameron ( 1967 , 1972 ) and middlehurst ( 1977a , b ) into correlations with several possible lunar parameters turn up primarily null relations e.g. , lunar anomalistic period ( time between perigees ) , and lunar age ( phase ) , and find some correlation with perigee and crossing of the earth s magnetopause and bow shock , plus a strong correlation with local sunrise which might be a selection effect based on observers attraction to this area of higher contrast .",
    "middlehurst ( 1977a , b ) also claims a statistically significant positional correlation between tlps and shallow moonquakes ( from nakamura et al .  1974 ) , which separately have been tied to @xmath49ar release ( hodges 1977 , binder 1980 ) .    with the results in section 2 , we seem to have developed a reliable means to compute the spatial distribution of the tlps , and we should use this as a tool for understanding their nature .",
    "the sites of consistent tlp activity are dominated by aristarchus and vicinity , to a lesser extent plato , followed perhaps by mare crisium , then the recent , large impacts ( tycho , kepler , copernicus ) and finally grimaldi .",
    "the often - reported sites alphonsus , gassendi and ross d might be spurious . in total , the area that is affected by",
    "such activity appears to be a vanishingly small fraction of the lunar surface ( at most a few percent , at least on the near side ) .    in crotts ( 2007a ) , however , we analyze the spatial distribution of non - optical transient events on or below the lunar surface .",
    "the robust distribution of tlps found above corresponds to a striking coincidence : of the four episodes when outbursts of @xmath25rn gas were detected by virtue of alpha - particle detection ( by detectors on _ apollo 15 _ and _ lunar prospector _ , all correspond to the small minority of the lunar surface responsible for the robust tlp reports ( grimaldi , kepler and aristarchus - twice ) .",
    "furthermore , there is a significant correlation between tlp loci and the edges of maria , which is similar in description to the significant correlation between maria edges and moonquakes ( also in crotts 2007a ) .",
    "also , this correlation with mare edges is seen for the density of alpha particles from @xmath50po decay , which is a tracer for lunar outgassing as a product of the decay of @xmath25rn gas .",
    "considering that 1 ) the spatial distibution of tlps is robust across the lunar near side regardless of various parameters tied to observer characteristics , and 2 ) this spatial distribution is highly correlated with tracers of lunar outgassing ( @xmath25rn and , indirectly @xmath50po ) , which we show elsewhere .",
    "these two results greatly strengthen the case for the reality of tlps : they behave in a repeatable fashion , and they are tied to outgassing from the lunar surface .",
    "in crotts & hummels ( 2007 ) and crotts ( 2007b ) we pursue this connection by showing how outgassing from the lunar surface with produce tlps and other effects due to volatiles which might be studied to confirm or refute this picture , and we also detail an array of measurement techiques which can further illucidate the tlp mystery , and tell us more about activity of lunar volatiles .",
    "a key part of this effort is a robotic lunar imaging monitor , which is practically capable of creating a new tlp data base without the enormous biases present in the powerful but flawed human observer record .",
