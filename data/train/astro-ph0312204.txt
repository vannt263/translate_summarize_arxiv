    "millisecond pulsars are rapidly spinning neutron stars with ( very ) small period derivatives ( p @xmath1 15 ms ; @xmath2 s / s ) .",
    "pulsars belonging to the millisecond - pulsar ( msp ) group are preferentially located in binary systems ( 75% ) , commonly with a white dwarf companion .",
    "it is generally believed that these sources represent the final stage of low - mass x - ray binary evolution .",
    "the link between the x - ray binary and msp stage is formed by the so - called accretion - driven x - ray msps of which there have been detected six members nowadays ( wijnands 2003 ) .",
    "the first x - rays from a spin - down powered msp had been detected by becker & trmper ( 1993 ) for psr j0437 - 4715 . with this detection a new spectral window , besides the radio band , was opened in which msps can be studied .",

    "the x - ray pulse profiles for this small group composed of psr j0437 - 4715 , psr j2124 - 3358 , psr j0030 + 0451 , psr b1821 - 24 , psr j0218 + 4232 and psr b1937 + 21 are shown in fig .",
    "[ profile_collage ] .",
    "this small group can on observational x - ray characteristics be subdivided in two classes , class - i and ii ( kuiper et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the class - i members - psr j0437 - 4715 , psr j2124 - 3358 and psr j0030 + 0451 - have low x - ray luminosities ( 1 - 10 kev ; @xmath4 erg / s ) , soft predominantly thermal x - ray spectra ( e.g. halpern et al . ( 1996 ) , zavlin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , sakurai et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , becker et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ) and broad pulses .",
    "it is generally believed that for this class the ( modulated ) x - ray emission originates from the polar cap region which is heated by backwards flowing particle currents in the pulsar s magnetosphere ( thus thermal emission ) .",
    "note , that in view of the high age of millisecond pulsars in general x - ray emission due to global surface cooling forms not a viable mechanism .",
    "in contrast , the class - ii members - psr b1821 - 24 , psr j0218 + 4232 and psr b1937 + 21 - have high x - ray luminosities ( 1 - 10 kev ; @xmath5 erg / s ) , hard power - law shaped x - ray spectra and emit narrow x - ray pulses .",
    "these characteristics point to a non - thermal origin related to physical processes taking place in the compact magnetosphere of a msp . because the latter class shows hard x - ray spectral tails up to @xmath6 kev and because for one member , psr j0218 + 4232 , pulsed high - energy @xmath0-rays have been detected ( kuiper et al .",
    "( 2000,2002 ) ) the msps in this class are promising candidates to be detected at high - energy @xmath0-rays ( @xmath7 mev ) by the future @xmath0-ray missions agile and glast and at soft @xmath0-rays ( 15 - 1000 kev ) by integral , launched october 2002 .",
    "therefore , in the remainder of this review we will focus on the class - ii msps .",
    "the first msp discovered in a globular cluster was psr b1821 - 24 in m28/ngc 6626 ( lyne et al .",
    "it is a solitary pulsar with a pulse period of @xmath8 ms and a period derivative of @xmath9 s / s .",
    "its characteristic age of @xmath10 year and spin - down luminosity of @xmath11 erg / s make it the  youngest \" and most energetic msp known today .",
    "pulsed x - ray emission from this msp was discovered by saito et al .",
    "( 1997 ) using asca gis data ( 0.7 - 10 kev ) . two narrow pulses with different intensities and separated @xmath12 in phase ( phase distance between main x - ray pulse and secondary x - ray pulse ) were visible in the pulse phase distribution . also at soft x - rays ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev )",
    "the x - ray pulsations were detected ( rosat hri ; danner et al .",
    "the hard nature of the pulsed emission suggested a magnetospheric origin .",
    "inaccuracies in the asca and rosat clocks prevented an  absolute \" alignment of the x - ray and radio profiles .",
    "a short 6.5 ks observation performed on 16 september 1996 with the pca aboard rxte made such a comparison in absolute phase possible ( rots et al .",
    "1998 ) : the x - ray ( 2 - 16 kev ) and radio profiles were nearly aligned , the main x - ray pulse xp1 lags the radio pulse by @xmath13s .",
    "it is interesting to note that the xp1 location is coincident with the phase location , where radio giant pulses occur ( romani & johnston 2001 ) .",
    "subsequent long exposure rxte observations ( 85.5 ks during 10  12 february 1997 ; 32.8 ks during 12  13 november 1999 ) of psr b1821 - 24 made it possible to study the x - ray timing and spectral properties in detail ( e.g. kawai et al .",
    "1999 ; kuiper et al .",
    "the resulting high statistics x - ray pulse profile ( 2 - 20 kev ) is shown in the upper right panel of fig .",
    "the phase separation is @xmath14 and the fwhm s of the x - ray pulses are 0.018(1 ) and 0.046(6 ) for pulse 1 and 2 , respectively , fitting two symmetric lorentzians and a flat background to the x - ray pulse profile .",
    "this corresponds to very small pulse widths of @xmath15s and @xmath16s for pulse 1 and 2 , respectively !    combining the data from the three rxte observations and two asca observations a joint spectral analysis ( 0.8 - 20 kev ) of the pulsed spectrum yielded a photon index of 1.13(2 ) assuming an absorbing column n@xmath17 of @xmath18@xmath19 ( kuiper et al .",
    "2004 ) .",

    "the total ( pulsed plus dc ) 0.5 - 8 kev spectrum obtained with the acis - s could be described by a power - law with photon index @xmath20 ( becker et al .",
    "both the photon index and normalization of the total spectrum are consistent with the corresponding numbers for the pulsed component alone , leaving little room for a dc - component .    a 50.8 ks chandra hrc - si observation of psr b1821 - 24 on 8 november 2002 made it possible to resolve the source and to determine the pulsed fraction of psr b1821 - 24 for the integral 0.08 - 10 kev energy band .",

    "the x - ray pulse alignment relative to the radio profile verified the chandra alignment results ( see fig . 3 for a multi - wavelength comparison of the pulse profile of psr j0218 + 4232 ) . a spectral analysis of the total pulsed signal combining ( revisited ) bepposax mecs and rxte pca data yielded a photon - index of @xmath34 over the entire mecs / pca energy range , one of the hardest spectra measured so far for any of the spin - down powered pulsars detected at x - rays !    finally , it is interesting to note that recently also for this pulsar large amplitude pulses have been detected at radio frequencies ( joshi et al .",

    "a remarkable feature is the existence of giant radio pulses ( wolszczan et al .",
    "1984 ; sallmen & backer 1995 ; cognard et al .",
    "1996 ) similar to those of the crab pulsar .",
    "an initial attempt to search for x - ray emission from this msp was performed by verbunt et al .",

    "spectral analyses of the total and pulsed signals ( 1.3 - 10 kev ; mecs ) showed a significant difference in the hardness of the spectra : total emission power - law index @xmath37 ; pulsed emission @xmath38 .",
    "this is evidence for the presence of an underlying soft dc - component whose spatial extension is compatible with the mecs point spread function , and its contribution to the total emission amounts @xmath39 in the 1.3 - 4 kev band ( nicastro et al .",
    "2004 )    in february 2002 psr b1937 + 21 was observed by rxte for about 140 ks . in the high - resolution pca 2 - 10 kev pulse profile two ( very ) sharp pulses were visible separated 0.526(2 ) in phase ( cusumano et al .",
    "the x - ray main and secondary pulses lag the radio main and interpulse by just @xmath40s and @xmath41s , respectively ( see fig .",

    "the latter value is more consistent with the pulse separation at x - rays .",
    "pulsed x - ray emission was detected up to @xmath6 kev and its spectrum could satisfactorily be described by a power - law with index @xmath42 , consistent with the mecs derived value .    at soft and high - energy @xmath0-rays only upper limits have been reported ( cgro osse : schroeder et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ; cgro egret : fierro et al .",

    "their spectra must soften drastically in the hard x - ray or soft @xmath0-ray range in order to be consistent with the flux upper limits for psr b1821 - 24 and psr b1937 + 21 and the flux measurements of psr j0218 + 4232 at @xmath0-ray energies ( see fig .",

    ".    models attempting to describe the high - energy emission from spin - down powered pulsars can crudely be divided in two classes : polar cap models ( e.g. harding et al .",

    "the high - energy radiation is produced close to the polar cap of the pulsar , while in outer gap models the high - energy radiation is generated in vacuum gaps near the last close field lines between the null charge surface and the light cylinder . at x - ray energies",
    "both model types predict a photon spectral index of @xmath45 ( rudak et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ; zhang et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ) which is too soft compared with the measured indices of the class - ii msps . also ,",
    "in the @xmath0-ray regime such spectral discrepancies exist .",
    "this underlines the inability of the both classes of theoretical models to reproduce the emerging high - energy spectra for class - ii msps properly . in kuiper",

    "1998 ) it was noted that the three class ii msps together with the crab pulsar and its twin in the lmc psr b0540 - 69 are among the top six pulsars with the highest magnetic field strengths near the light cylinder ( the sixth one is msp psr b1957 + 20 ) . it was argued that the pulsed high - energy non - thermal emission of these pulsars originates quite likely in outer gaps near the light cylinder , based on similarities with the crab pulsar .",
    "there is now additional supporting evidence in favour of an outer gap scenario for the production of the non - thermal emission : giant / large amplitude radio pulses - a phenomenon likely related to the physical conditions near the light cylinder ( romani & johnson 2001 ) - have now been detected for all class ii msps ( psr b1937 + 21 , cognard et al .",
