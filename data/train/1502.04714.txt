    "the fermi satellite has been observing the gamma ",
    "ray sky since its launch in june 2008 .",
    "it carries on  board two instruments : the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) and the large area telescope ( lat ) .",
    "gbm consists of 12 sodium iodide ( nai , 8900 kev ) and 2 bismuth germanate ( bgo , 200 kev40 mev ) scintillation detectors @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the placement and orientation of the detectors on the spacecraft , which allow gbm to have a field - of - view ( fov ) as large as the full unocculted sky .",
    "gbm detects @xmath0250 grbs per year @xcite .",
    "the lat instruments include a tracker - converter , a calorimeter and an anti  coincidence detector @xcite .",
    "the lat standard analysis covers an energy range of 100 mev300 gev .",
    "thanks to the lat low energy ( lle ) technique @xcite , this coverage is extended down to 10 mev .",
    "35 grbs were observed by lat during the first 3 years of operation @xcite , but many more are expected to be found thanks to a new analysis algorithm @xcite and to the newly implemented lat event reconstruction _",
    "pass 8 _ @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]         figure [ fig4 ] shows two example light curves from grb 100116a and grb 131014a . the trigger time is marked with a vertical dashed red line and the energy ranges are labeled in every panel . from the top : the first four panels represent nai data ( _ dark red labels _ ) , the subsequent two panels represent bgo data ( _ red labels _ ) while the last panel(s ) represent lle data ( _ orange labels _ ) .",
    "grb 100116a ( _ left panel _ ) is a rather long grb , with a two  episode emission , separated by an 80  s long quiescient period .",
    "the peak at trigger time disappears at higher energies .",
    "grb 131014a ( _ right panel _ ) is much shorter than grb 100116a and a delayed start of the high  energy emission is evident .",
    "this feature is quite common in lat - detected bursts ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the burst duration ( @xmath1 ) is calculated by means of idl  based routines and is defined as 90%  of the accumulation time in count space in each energy band .",
    "we also calculate @xmath2 , which we define as the beginning of @xmath1 at 5%  of counts .",
    "burst durations and @xmath2 values are computed in each energy band previously defined in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "results for grb 100116a and grb 131010a are plotted in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the _ top panels _ show the energy  duration relation , while the _ bottom panels _ show the @xmath2energy relation .",
    "we adopt different colors for the data points in order to represent the data from different detectors ( _ dark - red : _ nai , _ medium - red _ : bgo ; _ light - red _ : lle ) which were used for the analysis in each energy band ( as indicated in the labels of figure [ fig3 ] ) . in the case of grb 100116a ,",
    "the duration drops from @xmath3 s to just few seconds , while grb 131014a s duration smoothly decreases from one energy band to the next .",
    "this effect is visible also in the @xmath2 vs.  energy plots , where the delayed start of the higher  energy emission in grb 131014a is clearly visible .    in order to compare and evaluate the whole subsample of 27 bursts , we normalize all @xmath1 measurements and plot them as a function of energy in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "again , different colors indicate different detectors used for the temporal analysis . since not all bursts in the submsample are seen over all energy bands , we plot our results in three panels : 7 grbs in our subsample are detected only up to 10 mev , so no lle duration could be computed ( _ left panel _ ) .",
    "other 7 grbs are detected in lle but only up to 100 mev ( _ middle panel _ ) , while 13 grbs are detected all the way up to 1 gev ( _ right panel _ ) .",
    "we fit the data with a simple power law ( pl ) model ( _ blue dashed lines _ ) in order to compare the slopes of the duration ",
    "energy relations to what is previously reported in the literature .",
    "results for the pl slope @xmath4 are reported in box in the middle of each panel .",
    "@xcite , using batse data from 25 to @xmath5 kev , and more recently @xcite , using gbm bgo data from 300 kev to 10 mev , reported values of the pl slope @xmath4 between -0.4 and -0.3 .",
    "such values are much steeper then what we find in this analysis .",
    "particularly energetic grbs showing prompt high  energy emission , i.e. @xmath6 mev , have a much flatter behavior of the duration  energy relation .",
    "this possibly indicates that the prompt high  energy emission is closely related to the low ",
    "energy one .",
    "our future analysis steps include ( a ) the comparison of the pl slope @xmath4 of the duration  energy relation deduced from the 27 bright grbs subsample with the one deduced from the full sample of 311 bright bgo grbs ; the correlation of the duration ",
    "energy relation parameters with the burst spectral properties ; and",
    "( c ) the study of the temporal properties of pulses using temporally  resolved spectral analysis for the brightest peak of each grb in the subsample ; and ( d ) the study of the duration  energy relation at energies @xmath7 gev , using the lat standard analysis .",
    "this last step could help determining if the highest  energy emission is in fact afterglow emission shortly following the start of the prompt phase emission as seen at smaller frequencies .",
