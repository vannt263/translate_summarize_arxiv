    "the study of the faint outskirts of galaxies has become increasingly important in recent years . from a theoretical perspective",
    ", it has been realised that many important clues about the galaxy assembly process should lie buried in these parts .",
    "cosmological simulations of disk galaxy formation incorporating baryons have been carried out by several groups and yield predictions for the large - scale structure and stellar content at large radii  for example , the abundance and nature of stellar substructure and the ubiquity , structure and content of stellar halos and thick disks .",
    "these models generally predict a wealth of ( sub)structure at levels of @xmath0 mag/@xmath1 and fainter ; their verification thus requires imagery and spectroscopy of galaxies to ultra - faint surface brightness levels .    since malin first applied his photographic stacking and amplification technique ( e.g. malin et al .",
    "1983 ) , it has been known that some galaxies possess unusual low surface brightness ( lsb ) structures  shells , loops , asymmetric envelopes  in their outer regions .",
    "although limited to @xmath2 mag/@xmath1 , these images were sufficient to demonstrate that even the most `` normal '' nearby galaxies could become very abnormal when viewed at faint light levels ( e.g. weil et al 1997 ) .",
    "follow - up study of malin s lsb features , and several more recently - discovered examples ( e.g. shang et al . 1999 ) , has been severely limited due to the technical difficulties associated with detecting and quantifying diffuse light at surface brightnesses @xmath3 magnitudes below sky .",
    "the currently most viable technique to probe the very low surface brightness regions of galaxies is that of resolved star counts ( e.g. pritchet & van den bergh 1994 ) ; i review here some recent results from studies of the faint outer regions of m31 and m33 .",
    "kpc@xmath4 and @xmath5  kpc@xmath4 on a side respectively . ,",
    "height=302 ]    figure 1 shows maps of the red giant branch ( rgb ) population ( age @xmath6  gyr ) in m31 and m33 , covering 40 and 7 square degrees respectively .",
    "although the maps reach the same limiting depth ( @xmath7 magnitudes below the tip of the rgb ) , it can be clearly seen that outer regions of m31 contain a wealth of substructure that is not present in m33 ( ferguson et al .",
    "2002 , ferguson et al .",
    "2007 , in prep ) .",
    "the faintest features visible by eye in the m31 map have effective v - band surface brightnesses of @xmath8 mag/@xmath1 ; if substructure is present in m33 , it must be of lower surface brightness than this .",
    "various features can be seen around m31 , including a giant stream in the south - east , stellar overdensities at large radii along the major axis , a diffuse structure in the north - east and a loop of stars projected near ngc  205 .",
    "it is of obvious importance to establish the origin of this substructure .",
    "bullock & johnston ( 2005 ) predict substructure in the outer regions of galaxies due to tidal debris from the accretion and disruption of an expected population of @xmath9 luminous satellites .",
    "gauthier et al . ( 2006 ) and kazantzidis et al .",
    "( in prep ) further show how the accretion of such a population will heat and restructure the thin disk , producing additional `` low latitude '' debris .",
    "i summarize here our current understanding of the substructure seen around m31 :    * deep hst / acs cmds reaching well below the horizontal branch have been obtained for 8 regions in the far outskirts of m31 , including seven regions of visible substructure .",
    "many of the cmds exhibit different morphologies , suggesting variations in the mean age and metallicity of the constituent stars ( ferguson et al .",
    "2005 ) . in all cases , the metallicity inferred from the rgb colour is significantly higher ( [ fe / h]@xmath10 ) than that of typical present - day low mass local group dwarf satellites ( [ fe / h]@xmath11 ) , implying that such objects are unlikely to be the progenitors of the observed substructure . *",
    "all substructure fields lying near the major axis contain stars of age @xmath12  gyr ( faria et al 2007 ; richardson et al .",
    ", in preparation ) ; this includes the ne clump field , which lies at a projected radius of 40  kpc .",
    "additionally , the major axis substructure fields are dominated by a strong rotational signature , similar to the hi disk , with a modest velocity dispersion ( ibata et al . 2005 ) . taken together , these results suggest that the `` low - latitude '' structure in m31 results primarily from perturbed outer thin disk . *",
    "the combination of line - of - sight distances and radial velocities for stars at various locations along the giant stream constrains the progenitor orbit ( e.g. ibata et al .",
    "2004 ; fardal et al .",
    "currently - favoured orbits do not easily connect the more luminous inner satellites ( e.g. m32 , ngc  205 ) to the stream however this finding leaves some remarkable coincidences ( e.g. the projected alignment on the sky , similar metallicities ) yet unexplained .",
    "the giant stream is linked to another overdensity , the diffuse feature lying north - east of m31 s centre , on the basis of nearly identical cmd morphologies and rgb luminosity functions ; orbit calculations suggest this connection is indeed likely .",
    "tidal debris from accretion events will disperse over time and streams from ancient events will have long merged to produce a diffuse stellar halo ( e.g. abadi et al . 2005 ; bullock & johnston et al 2005 ) .",
    "if hierarchical growth is the main mode of mass assembly then such stellar halos should be a generic feature of galaxies . unfortunately , there are very few observational constraints on the nature and ubiquity of stellar halos around galaxies ( see however zibetti et al .",
    "even our understanding of the m31 and m33 stellar halos was extremely poor until recently .",
    "i summarize some key results here :      using data from the int / wfc survey , irwin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) combined diffuse light surface photometry with resolved star counts to probe the minor axis profile of m31 to a radius of @xmath13kpc ( effective @xmath14  mag/@xmath15 ) .",
    "the profile shows an unexpected flattening ( relative to the inner r@xmath16 decline ) at a radius of @xmath17kpc , beyond which it can be described by shallow power - law ( index @xmath18 ) , possibly extending out to 150  kpc ( kalirai et al .",
    "this compares favourably with the milky way halo , which exhibits a power - law index of @xmath19 in volume density ( vivas et al .",
    "the discovery of a power - law component which dominates the light at large radii in m31 has profound implications for the interpretation of all prior studies of the m31 `` stellar halo '' .",
    "since these studies generally targetted regions lying within 30  kpc along the minor axis , they most likely probed the extended disk / bulge region of the galaxy and not the true stellar halo .",
    "keck / deimos spectroscopy has been used to study the kinematics and metallicities of stars in the far outer regions of m31 . by windowing out the stars which corotate with the hi disk , chapman et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have detected an underlying metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath20 ) , pressure - supported ( @xmath21  km / s ) component ( see also kalirai et al .",
    "although it has yet to be proven that this component is the same one which dominates the power - law profile at very large radius , the evidence is highly suggestive . despite many years of thinking otherwise , it thus appears that m31 does indeed have a stellar halo which resembles that of the milky way in terms of structure , metallicity and kinematics .",
    "studies of the m33 stellar halo have also had a somewhat checkered history .",
    "mould & kristian ( 1986 ) measured [ m / h]@xmath22 in a field located at 7  kpc along the minor axis of m33 and , for the better part of two decades , this metallicity was generally assumed to reflect that of the m33 halo .",
    "recent work has found a significantly higher metallicity for stars in this same field and , at the same time , suggested that the field is actually dominated by the outer disk and not the stellar halo ( e.g. tiede et al .",
    "2004 , ferguson et al .",
    "2007 in prep ) .",
    "the detection of a power - law structural component in the outskirts of m33 has so far proved elusive , although the rgb clearly becomes narrower and more metal - poor in these parts ( ferguson et al .",
    "2007 in prep ) .",
    "a recent keck / deimos spectroscopic study has targetted two fields in the outskirts of the galaxy , located at @xmath23  kpc along the major axis ( mcconnachie et al .",
    "although the dominant kinematic component in these fields exhibits strong rotation , there is tentative evidence for an additional low - level metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath24 ) component centered at the systemic velocity .",
    "while further work is clearly needed to elucidate the nature of this structure , the estimated velocity dispersion ( @xmath25  km / s ) supports an association with m33 s true stellar halo .",
    "quantitative study of the faint outskirts of galaxies provides important insight into the galaxy assembly process .",
    "much recent work has focused on our nearest large neighbours , m31 and m33 . while both appear to show evidence for a metal - poor , pressure - supported stellar halo ( similar to that of the milky way ) , only m31 shows evidence for recent accretion . in order to put these results in context ,",
    "it is necessary to establish the properties of a larger sample of galaxies , spanning a range in both host galaxy luminosity and hubble type . with 8-m class telescopes ,",
    "it is possible to map the rgb populations in the outskirts of galaxies to distances of @xmath26  mpc ; with hst , this work can feasibly be extended to @xmath27  mpc .",
    "spectroscopic characterization of resolved rgb populations beyond the local group is far harder and must await the arrival of 30-m class telescopes .",
