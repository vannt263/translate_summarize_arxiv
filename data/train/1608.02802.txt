    "[ theory ] , we present the eft framework within which the even - even / odd - mass nuclei will be described , establish a power counting and describe energy spectra at next - to - next - to - leading order . sections  [ e2 ] and  [ m1 ] are dedicated to the study of moments and transitions of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 operators , respectively . in section  [ discuss ]",
    "we discuss the possible extension of the eft to the more complicated case posed by cadmium isotopes .",
    "finally , in section  [ summary ] we present our summary .",
    "certain even - even nuclei ( such as isotopes of cd , ru , and te ) exhibit low - energy states that resemble those of a five - dimensional quadrupole oscillator . in these nuclei ,",
    "the vibrational frequency @xmath9  mev is the energy scale of interest , and the picture of a quadrupole vibrator breaks down at an energy @xmath10 - 3  mev , i.e. around the three - phonon level .",
    "the breakdown scale @xmath11 is associated with neglected microscopic ( fermionic ) degrees of freedom and is of similar size as the pairing gap .",
    "thus , @xmath12 holds , and this separation of scale has been exploited in ref .",
    "@xcite to construct an eft for nuclear vibrations .",
    "the spectra of certain odd - mass neighbors of vibrational nuclei are relatively simple and suggest that these result from coupling a @xmath13 fermion to the even - even nucleus .",
    "examples we consider in this paper are @xmath14rh and @xmath15ag as a proton coupled to @xmath16ru and @xmath17pd , respectively , or @xmath18ag as a proton - hole in @xmath19cd .",
    "these cases are particularly simple because one deals with a @xmath20 degree of freedom .",
    "we note here that the odd - mass nuclei considered in this work also exhibit very low - lying ( 100  kev or less ) states with positive parity .",
    "as a single fermion can not undergo parity - changing transitions , the positive - parity states can be neglected in the description of low - lying negative - parity states in the odd - mass nuclei .",
    "could one also attempt to describe , for instance , @xmath19cd in terms of two protons added to @xmath21pd , respectively ?",
    "in such an eft approach , the low - lying positive - parity states of @xmath18ag would also need to enter the description .",
    "the calculation would be non - perturbative ( because of the near degeneracy of states with positive and negative parities in the odd - mass nucleus ) , and a significant number of fermionic two - body - matrix elements would enter as low energy constants ( lecs ) .",

    "we do not need to consider other hamiltonian terms such as @xmath59 or @xmath60 because these are linear combinations of the terms already included in the hamiltonian  ( [ hf ] ) .",

    "the attractive interaction between two nucleons ( with isospin one ) fail to bind the pair in vacuum but yields a bound state with energy @xmath62 when coupled to the core .",
    "we note that @xmath66 , as pairing effects are one source of the breakdown scale of the even - even nucleus .",
    "the interaction between boson and fermion degrees of freedom is most interesting .",
    "two - body terms of the structure @xmath67 and @xmath68 couple phonons to fermions . here",
    ", the first term could be referred to as a `` coriolis '' interaction , because it couples the spin of the fermion to the spin of the core .",
    "in addition to these interactions there are three - body terms of the forms @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 . here , the first two three - body terms involve the annihilation and creation of two phonons and are suppressed in comparison to the three - body term involving only one phonon .",
