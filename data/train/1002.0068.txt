    "[ 1intr1 ] easter island history is a very famous example of an evolved human society that collapsed for over exploiting its fundamental resources @xcite that in this case were essentially in palm trees .",
    "it were covering the island@xcite when , few dozens of individuals , first landed around 400 a.d .",
    "its advanced culture was developed in a period of one thousand years approximately .",
    "its ceremonial rituals and associated construction were demanding more and more natural resources especially palm trees .",
    "the over exploitation of this kind of tree , very necessary as a primary resource ( tools construction , cooking , erosion barrier , etc . ) was related with the collapse . in this paper ,",
    "a mathematical model concerning growing and collapse of this society is presented .",
    "different to usual like lotka - volterra models@xcite where the carrying capacity variation becomes from external natural forces , in this work it is directly connected with the population dynamics .",
    "namely , population and carrying capacity are interacting dynamics variables , so generalizing the leslie model prey - predator .",
    "the general mathematical treatment of a model describing such a complex society is a very hard task and probably not unique .",
    "our aim is to settle the most simple model describing with acceptable precision the evolution of easterner society . with the idea of writing a model that could be generalized to a more complex system",
    ", we first divide the elements into two categories : the _ resource _ quantity @xmath0 with @xmath1 and the _ inhabitants _ numbers ( species ) @xmath2 with @xmath3 . with the concept of resources we are meaning resources in a very large sense , it could be oil , trees , food and so on .",
    "the several kind of resources are described by the index @xmath4 . in similar way , with the concept of inhabitants , we are meaning different species of animals or internal subdivision of human being in country or town or even tribes . leaving the idea of a constant quantity of resources that leads to the logistic equation for the number on inhabitants@xcite , the aim of this paper is to include in the dynamical description of the time evolution of the system the resources too which can not be considered as constant .",
    "a generalization of the logistic equation to an arbitrary number of homogeneous species interacting among the individuals ( with non constant resources ) can be written as    @xmath5 -\\sum\\limits_{j=1\\,,i\\neq j}^{m}\\chi _ { ij}n_{j}n_{i}. \\label{log - inter}\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 is the usual growing rate for species @xmath4 . in the denominator it appears the carrying capacity of the system with respect to the number of inhabitants @xmath7 . beside the dependence on the resources",
    "@xmath0 we could have also a dependence on an other species that would be then a resource  for some other species .",
    "this fact is expressed even by the quantities @xmath8 that in general are not symmetric expression ( @xmath9 ) since that the prey is a resource for the predator and not the inverse .",
    "similarly , for the resources we have :    @xmath10 -\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{m}\\alpha _",
    "{ ij}n_{j}r_{i}.   \\label{res - inter}\\ ] ]    it is clear that set of equations ( [ res - inter ] ) could be formally included into eq .",
    "( [ log - inter ] ) redefining the quantities @xmath11 .",
    "nevertheless , we shall keep this distinction for the sake of clarity especially referred to resources , such as trees , oil or oxygen , where the carrying capacity is not determined by other species and can be considered a constant ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "also the meaning of the parameters @xmath13 is more or less the same of the analogous parameters @xmath6 .",
    "it is suitable to define @xmath13 as renewability ratios , since describe the capacity of the resources to renew itself and clearly are depending on the kind of resource .",
    "for example , the renewability of the oil is clearly zero since the period of time to get oil from a natural process is of the order of geological time - scale processes . in general all parameters of eqs .",
    "( [ log - inter ] ) and ( [ res - inter ] ) are time dependent , including stochasticity .",
    "we can assume reasonably slowly time - varying for the ancient societies so that we can consider it as constant@xcite , particularly the @xmath14 s .",
    "anyway the set of @xmath11 is worthy of a more detailed discussion .",
    "we can call this set of parameters _ technological parameters _ in the sense that they carry the information about the capacity to exploit the resources of the habitat .",
    "we shall see in the next section that the technological parameters combined with the renewability ratios will be the key point to decide wether , or not , a society is destined to collapse .",
    "the particular history of easter island society presents several advantages for modelling its evolution @xcite .",
    "in fact it can be with very good approximation considered a closed system .",
    "the peculiar style of life and culture allows us to consider a basic model where trees are essentially the only kind of resources .",
    "many of activities of the ancient inhabitants involved the trees , from building and transport the enormous moai , to build boats for fishing , etc .",
    "in fact the cold water was not adapt to the fish life and the impervious shape of the coast made difficult fishing . finally from historical reports",
    "it can be inferred that the inhabitants did not change the way to exploit their main resource , even very near to exhaust it so that we can consider the technological parameter as constant .",
    "considering eqs .",
    "( [ log - inter ] ) and ( [ res - inter ] ) for one inhabitant species and one kind of resource , we obtain :    @xmath15 , \\label{log - inter1}\\ ] ]    @xmath16 -\\alpha nr , \\label{res - inter1}\\ ] ]    where we introduce the notation : @xmath17 .",
    "the unknown function @xmath18 has to satisfy few properties . for a quantity of primary unlimited resource , @xmath19 , even @xmath20 that means that the population can grow unlimited too . in the opposite case",
    "@xmath21 clearly also the population must vanish , @xmath22 , and finally when the resource is constant we are back to the ordinary equation ( logistic ) so that @xmath23 .",
    "it is clear that the choice of this relation is quite arbitrary but following the simplicity criteria we can select @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a positive parameter .",
    "this choice formalizes the intuition that the maximum number of individuals tolerated by a niche is proportional to the quantity of resources .",
    "we note that in ( [ res - inter1 ] ) the interacting term depend on the variable @xmath26 .",
    "namely , for @xmath27 no variation of resource exist ( @xmath28 ) corresponding to a biological criterion and different from this one of reference@xcite .",
    "a more sophisticate model should include also fishing as resource and consider for @xmath18 an expression such as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the fishing carrying capacity .",
    "this resource was limited near the coast and could not be fully exploited without boats , so that , we are going to neglect this resource .",
    "we can rewrite eqs .",
    "( [ log - inter1 ] ) and ( [ res - inter1 ] ) as :    @xmath31 ,   \\label{log - inter2}\\ ] ]    @xmath32 , \\,\\,\\,\\,\\textrm{where } \\,\\,\\alpha _ { e}\\equiv \\frac{\\alpha } { r^{\\prime } } .",
    "\\label{res - inter2}\\ ] ]    the dimensionless parameter @xmath33 is the ratio between the technological parameter @xmath34 , representing the capability of to exploit the resources , and @xmath35 the renewability parameter representing the capability of the resources to regenerate .",
    "we will call @xmath33 deforestation parameter since it gives a measure of the rapidity with which the resources are going to exhaust and then a measure of the reversibility or irreversibility of the collapse . using the historical data we can have an estimation of the parameters . at the origin ( @xmath36 )",
    "we can assume that the trees were covering the entire island surfaces of 160 km@xmath37 .",
    "when the first humans arrived to the island , around the 400 a.d .",
    ", their number was of the order of few dozens of individuals and it grew until to reach the maximum @xmath38 around the 1300 a.d .",
    "finding the equilibrium points of eqs .",
    "( [ log - inter2 ] ) and ( res - inter2 ) we obtain ( see section iii , for stability ) :    @xmath39    @xmath40    while the point @xmath41 of eq .",
    "( [ equin ] ) represents the trivial fact that in absence of human being the number of trees is constant ( carrying capacity ) .",
    "( [ equir ] ) describes the fact that , due to the interaction humans - environment , the more interesting equilibrium point @xmath42 does not coincide with @xmath43 with @xmath44 since @xmath45 . to study the stability of the point @xmath42 , we have linearize the system of eqs .",
    "( [ log - inter2 ] ) and ( [ res - inter2])around the equilibrium point .",
    "in fact , in the next section we shall show that it is a stable equilibrium point .",
    "let us first cast eqs .",
    "( [ log - inter2 ] ) and ( [ res - inter2 ] ) in term of dimensionless quantities ; setting @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , we have :    @xmath49   \\label{adnu}\\ ] ]    @xmath50 , \\,\\,\\,\\,\\bar{\\alpha}\\equiv \\alpha _ { e}n_{c},\\,\\,\\,\\,\\bar{r}\\equiv \\frac{r^{\\prime } } { r}.   \\label{adro}\\ ] ]    for sake of clarity we rewrite also the equilibrium point : @xmath51 with obvious meaning of the symbols . perturbing the equilibrium point",
    "@xmath52 $ ] and @xmath53 $ ] with @xmath54 and @xmath55 infinitesimal functions , after straightforward algebra we obtain eq .",
    "( [ equir ] ) :    @xmath56    @xmath57   \\label{lineps1}\\ ] ]    the eigenvalues of the system are :    @xmath58    restricting ourself to the case of positive values of @xmath59 , eq . ( [ eig ] ) shows that both the eigenvalues always have a real negative part , so that the equilibrium point @xmath60 is a stable equilibrium point .",
    "more in detail we have that for    @xmath61 the eigenvalues are real and negative so that the equilibrium point is reached in exponential damped way , otherwise the eigenvalues acquire an imaginary part and the system reach the equilibrium point via exponential damped oscillations .",
    "even if , mathematically speaking , the stable point @xmath62 is an acceptable result we have to take in account the biological constraints that allow to a specie to survive . a reasonable number of individuals is required for viability of a given species @xcite .",
    "this is so because genetic diversity , social structures , encounters , etc .",
    ", need a minimum numbers of individuals since under this critical numbers the species is not viable and collapse .",
    "it is worthy to stress that while the trees can reach an equilibrium point without the humans , eq .",
    "( [ equin ] ) , the opposite does not hold , as stated by eq .",
    "( [ equir ] ) .    calling the minimum number of humans",
    "@xmath63 we can find a upper bound for the parameter @xmath33 so that a civilization can survive .",
    "imposing the condition that at the equilibrium point @xmath64 we obtain :    @xmath65    as further simplification of inequality ( [ bond ] ) , we assume that @xmath66 and we find that @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
    "it is a natural condition since it tells that collapse exists when the production rate @xmath35 is minor than the deforestation rate @xmath69 .",
    "more in general it can be showed , numerically , that considering the standard case with the starting population number @xmath70 , we can have a solution that can exceed the value @xmath71 ( depending on initial conditions @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) .",
    "it is worthy to stress that in the case of ordinary logistic map the population number never can exceed this limit value@xcite . in the example of fig .",
    "[ figlor ] , the maximum of @xmath74 is reached at a value that is almost three times @xmath71 .",
    "then , according to the region of the parameters that we are considering , the paths to the final equilibrium is exponentially fast , reaching eventually the point @xmath63 and collapsing .",
    "as we saw in the previous section , the collapse condition ( 15 ) gives a sufficient condition on the deforestation rate per individual @xmath75 . on other hand ,",
    "the last period of tree extinction was governed essentially by the deforestation rate . in this way",
    ", we have the rate of tree extinction    @xmath76    as discussed , the path to the equilibrium point is exponentially fast , so that a rough estimation of the left side of eq .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) is the time scale of the deforestation , @xmath77 , while the right side can be taken at the end of the collapse process ( the equilibrium point ) : @xmath78being @xmath79 the final number of individuals .",
    "it can be deduced pointing that the range of is @xmath80 yrs . to @xmath81 yrs . and",
    "@xmath82 , the rate of deforestation ( per individual ) could be estimated as : @xmath83giving a range @xmath84this estimation has validity in the case of exponential decay which is the our case , as it has been showed by the analysis performed in sec . equilibrium . assuming the number of trees as proportional to the area @xmath85 we can now estimate the rate - deforestation - area .",
    "the island has a surface at order of @xmath86 km@xmath37 and initially it can be supposed that was covered of trees so that we can estimate : @xmath87as comparison we can consider that in the last 500 years the deforestation of amazonian forest rate is 15 @xmath88 . considering that in 500 years the deforestation technology became more and more efficient , especially in the last century , we can consider it as an upper limit , giving us an idea of the technological change . in the human history",
    "there are several examples of over exploiting the natural resources even if not so known as easter island .",
    "in particular , the copn maya history@xcite has certain similarity with respect to the technology level and the over exploiting of the natural resources . in short ,",
    "this ancient civilization reached almost 20.000 individuals and declined to 5000 individuals in the 9th century . using the estimation of the technological parameter @xmath34 obtained for eastern island civilization",
    ", we get a collapse time from eq .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) that is @xmath89 years .",
    "the collapse time based on historical reports is @xmath90 , showing that the adopted model is consistent with the available data .",
    "the estimation of the parameter is consistent with the idea that similar civilizations , in technological meaning , have similar capacity to exploit the natural resources .",
    "a mathematical model considering the interaction among carrying capacity and population in an isolated system has been considered .",
    "the model takes in account the fact that a population can over exploit the carrying capacity without saturate , a fact of relevant importance on the path leading to a collapse of a society .",
    "its application to the collapse of the easter island civilization has been presented .",
    "an estimation of the technological parameter @xmath34 is obtained and applied to an other ancient civilization , the copn - maya , with a reasonably precise expectation about their collapse time . all confirming the consistency of the adopted model . on the other hand , its relative reasonable prediction suggests a possible extension to more complex system .",
