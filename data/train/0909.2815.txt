    "the variation of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature with redshift is a basic relation which in adiabatically evolving cosmological models is @xmath5 , normalized to the cobe / firas value at the present epoch , @xmath6k @xcite . in light of the fundamental role",
    "the cmb plays in cosmology , and given our detailed knowledge of its spatial structure , the lack of precise observational confirmation of this important relation is rather surprising .",
    "further motivation to measure @xmath0 is provided by the prediction of different non - linear redshift scaling law in alternative cosmological models ( e.g. @xcite ) . in particular , we consider here the scaling law proposed by @xcite , @xmath2 , with @xmath1 a free ( constant ) parameter ; this scaling is presumed to be a consequence of photon number and radiation entropy non - conservation .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence has traditionally been tested by measurements of quasar absorption spectra which include fine - structure lines from interstellar atoms and ions ( e.g. , @xcite ) . using this method",
    "the cmb temperature was measured to a maximum redshift of @xmath7 , at which @xmath8 k was determined from an analysis of the cii fine - structure lines in the damped @xmath9 system towards the quasar q03473819 @xcite .",
    "the fact that the cmb is not the only radiation field populating the energy levels ( from which the transitions occur ) , and lack of detailed knowledge of the physical conditions in the absorbing clouds - is a major source of systematic uncertainty ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a strong limit on @xmath1 was deduced @xcite using cmb and galaxy distribution data . however",
    ", this method can not be used to determine the @xmath0 scaling .",
    "the possibility of determining @xmath0 from measurements of the sunyaev - zeldovich ( s - z ) effect had been suggested long ago @xcite .",
    "the effect - compton scattering of the cmb by hot intracluster ( ic ) gas - is a small change of the cmb spectral intensity , @xmath4 , which depends on the integrated ic gas pressure along the line of sight ( los ) to the cluster .",
    "the steep frequency dependence of the change in the cmb spectral intensity , @xmath4 , due to the s - z effect allows the cmb temperature to be estimated at the redshift of the cluster .",
    "since the ratio of the values of @xmath4 measured at two frequencies is essentially independent of the cluster properties , the value of the temperature at the cluster redshift can be deduced directly from this ratio @xcite .",
    "the much improved capability of precise multi - frequency measurements of the effect enhances interest in this method to measure @xmath0 in nearby and moderately distant clusters .",
    "the first attempt to determine @xmath0 from an analysis of multifrequency s - z measurements in the coma and a2163 clusters of galaxies was reported in @xcite .",
    "preliminary results from an analysis of a larger sample of clusters , with @xmath10 , was presented in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report the final results from the current cluster sample carrying out a significantly expanded statistical data analysis .",
    "the statistical analysis is based on both ratios of @xmath4 , which are weakly dependent on the cluster properties , as well as the values of the individual @xmath4 whose dependence on cluster properties is marginalized over ( also ) the thomson optical depth .",
    "we discuss the consistency between these two analysis methods .",
    "in section [ sec : method ] we outline the basic methods used to determine @xmath0 .",
    "data analysis and the results for @xmath1 are presented in section [ sec : dataanalysis ] .",
    "we end with a brief summary in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "compton scattering of the cmb in a cluster causes a change of intensity that can be written as [ eq : deltaisz ] i= 2 k^3 t^3 h^2c^2 x^4e^x ( e^x -1)^2 d , where @xmath11 is the dimensionless frequency , @xmath12 is the electron temperature in units of the electron rest energy , and @xmath13 is the line of sight ( los ) component of the cluster velocity ( divided by @xmath14 ) in the cmb frame .",
    "the integral is over the thomson optical depth , @xmath15 .",
    "both the thermal @xcite and kinematic @xcite components of the effect are included in equation ( 1 ) in the first two terms , and in the function @xmath16 .",
    "this latter term is the relativistic correction @xcite to the non - relativistic expressions for the thermal and kinematic components .",
    "an analytic approximation ( which is sufficiently exact even close to the crossover frequency ) can be written in the form [ eq : relcorr ] r(x , , ) ^2 - + ^2 . the spectral functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 are specified in @xcite ;",
    "see also @xcite .    with @xmath19 , and @xmath20 ,",
    "the non - dimensional frequency depends on redshift if @xmath21 , @xmath22 , with @xmath23 . the steep frequency dependence of the change in the cmb spectral intensity allows the cmb temperature to be estimated at the redshift of the cluster . in the non - relativistic limit",
    "@xmath4 depends linearly on the comptonization parameter , @xmath24 , which includes all dependence on ic gas properties .",
    "a ratio of values of @xmath4 at two frequencies is then essentially independent of the cluster properties . in the more general case , the first term in the square parentheses in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltaisz ] ) still dominates over the other two , except near the crossover frequency , where the sum of the temperature dependent terms vanishes . for values of @xmath25 outside some range ( roughly , @xmath26 ) ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath13 is very weak since the observed temperature range in clusters corresponds to @xmath27 , whereas typically @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , data points at or near the crossover frequency are noise - dominated , and thus carry relatively low statistical weight in the likelihood function we construct for @xmath1 or @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , we include these points in our analysis .",
    "we analyzed results of multi - frequency s - z measurements toward 13 clusters spanning the redshift range @xmath29 .",
    "the dataset includes measurements with the bima , ovro , suzie - ii , scuba , and mito telescopes , as well as gas temperatures determined from x - ray measurements .",
    "we assumed a gaussian profile for the spectral bands of each experiment . in order to evaluate systematics",
    "induced by different spectral efficiencies of the bands , we repeated the analysis with squared profiles .",
    "the error contribution is negligible as compared with uncertainties in values of the central frequency and bandwidth .",
    "the clusters , redshifts , and gas temperatures are listed in table [ tab : tablex ] , and the s - z data are in table [ tab : tablesz ] . in the analysis we allowed for calibration uncertainty , considered as an uncertain scale factor , which was modeled as a gaussian with mean 1 and @xmath30 standard deviation .",
    ", based on observations of the brightness of planets .",
    "we have adopted a conservative approach in assuming maximum errors in order not to be biased by different calibration procedures of different experiments . ]",
    "this is an adequate approximation given the relatively narrow widths of the respective gaussian distributions . for the radial component of the cluster peculiar velocities",
    "we assume a universal vanishing mean with a @xmath31 km / s standard deviation .",
    "the calculation begins with convolution of @xmath32 with the detector gaussian spectral response function with width @xmath33 , [ eq : convolution ] i(_0 ) _ = 0^i ( ) e^-d , using the approximate analytic expression for ( the relativistically correct ) @xmath32 derived by @xcite .",
    "integration by parts then yielded an analytic approximation to the frequency - convolved @xmath32 , accurate to order @xmath34 .",
    "the sole purpose of deriving the latter analytic ( rather cumbersome ) approximations ( which are not specified here ) was to enable a faster convolution of the theoretical expression for @xmath32 with the detector gaussian spectral response .",
    "the probability of measuring an intensity change @xmath35 at frequency @xmath36 towards a cluster at redshift @xmath37 , with velocity parameter @xmath38 , gas parameters @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and model parameter @xmath1 is , @xmath41^{2 } } { 2\\sigma_{i}^{2}(\\nu_{j})}\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the result of convolution of the theoretically predicted intensity change with the spectral response function ( calculated using eq.[eq : convolution ] ) , and @xmath42 is measurement error standard deviation .",
    "the cmb temperature at the redshift of each cluster was first extracted by performing statistical analysis on the ratios @xmath43 ( @xmath44 is the observed thermodynamic temperatures in the @xmath45-th photometric band ) marginalizing over @xmath46 and @xmath13 - the original ( hereafter ) ri approach - and by using each of these separately and marginalizing also over @xmath15 , @xmath46 and @xmath13 - the di approach .",
    "assuming the s - z data are gaussianly distributed allows us to construct the relevant single - cluster and multiple - cluster likelihood functions .",
    "we note that the high - dimensionality of the marginalization , over the full parameter space , including also the calibration uncertainty ( see section [ par : ratio ] ) can potentially be a source for large numerical errors .",
    "we therefore employed two separate pipelines in the di analysis - a direct numerical integration and monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) sampling .",
    "after proper treatment of the systematics the different methods give consistent results .",
    "the ri approach - first employed in our previous work @xcite - is based on the use of the likelihood function of intensity ratios , thereby removing ( to first order ) dependence on the comptonization parameter @xcite . by doing so we largely avoid the need to account for modeling uncertainties in the determination of the gas density and temperature profiles ( from x - ray surface brightness and spectral measurements ) .",
    "dependence on the measured gas temperatures , @xmath47 , is also largely removed in the leading term , although @xmath47 is still needed to calculate the relativistic correction which includes second order terms in @xmath47 .",
    "measurements at the crossover frequency were not included in the analysis due to the inherent problematics associated with inclusion of very weak signals in the likelihood function ( e.g. , ` cauchy tail ' , bimodality , etc ) , which are expected to be dominated by instrumental noise and systematic uncertainties , so their relative weight in the likelihood function would be negligible .",
    "the distribution of ratios may have complicated features , but if carefully applied can be a very powerful tool due to the reduced number of essential parameters in the problem . in our case",
    "the distribution of ratios of temperature changes is manifestly non - gaussian , but we are interested in constraining the cmb temperature ( or the parameter @xmath1 ) rather than @xmath48 itself .",
    "the distribution is expected to be normal when the cluster sample is large .",
    "as shown in appendix a , this approach has the unwanted feature that the expectation value of the ratio is biased to a degree which is of @xmath49 , but in the limit of very precise measurements the fractional error decreases as does the degree of bias .",
    "this follows from the fact that a uni - modal distribution function behaves as a gaussian sufficiently close to its peak , and if measurement errors are sufficiently small the function is sharply peaked .",
    "in other words , when the function is highly concentrated near the peak , any value of the parameter ( for which the distribution function does not vanish ) is in the ` gaussian - regime ' .",
    "this guarantees that the ratio - distribution is an unbiased gaussian .",
    "however , for the small number of clusters in our present sample , and the low quality of some of the measurements , our results are still affected by this bias , but at a level smaller than the statistical uncertainty .",
    "the situation will improve substantially in the near future , when planned surveys with planck and other s - z projects will provide a very large sample of clusters .",
    "a more complete discussion of the ratio approach is given in appendix a.    the joint distribution function is derived from a set of @xmath50 s - z measurements ( at @xmath50 different frequency bands , excluding the crossover frequency ) of a given cluster . in doing",
    "so we choose the s - z data point with the smallest fractional error to be in the denominator of the @xmath51 ratios so as to minimize the bias ( appendix a ) .",
    "we construct the likelihood function of the simultaneously calculated @xmath51 ratios for a given frequency ( in the denominator ) obtaining a single likelihood function per cluster .",
    "the likelihood function that encapsulates the multi - cluster information is defined as @xmath52 where the index @xmath45 runs over all clusters in the sample . in the following we marginalize over @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and calibration uncertainty , denoted here by @xmath55 . in the limit of sufficiently large dataset ,",
    "the joint likelihood function is gaussian in @xmath1 by virtue of the central limit theorem and in accord with the reasoning we specified above .",
    "the average gas temperatures and their errors , as obtained from x - ray observations , are summarized in table [ tab : tablex ] .",
    "the smaller ( than thermal ) kinematic component vanishes to first order ( due to motion either toward or away from the observer ) .",
    "as noted , we carried out another independent analysis based on using the measured values of @xmath4 themselves , rather than their ratios .",
    "this second approach was implemented in two separate and very different treatments .",
    "the first consisted of the construction of a likelihood function that incorporates the multi - cluster information , with direct numerical 2d integrations involved in the marginalization over @xmath15 , @xmath46 , @xmath13 and @xmath55 ( the integration over @xmath13 and @xmath55 is carried out analytically after taylor expanding the integrand in powers of @xmath13 and @xmath55 ) @xmath56 for @xmath15 we use a flat ( positive definite ) prior ; for the other parameters priors are chosen as in the ri approach ( see section [ sec : dataanalysis ] ) .",
    "the second independent treatment is based on mcmc sampling , which is very commonly used in a wide class of problems , where complex dependencies between the parameters greatly impact the likelihood function , so that direct integrations could be quite tedious and prone to numerical instabilities ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this treatment",
    "we construct a single likelihood for each cluster , in order to get directly @xmath0 at the cluster redshift , and also to check parameter degeneracies .",
    "the mcmc method constitutes a random sequence of realizations of the fit parameters which - when properly sampled in parameter space - tends to reproduce the posterior distribution for all the parameters .",
    "the technique is easily implemented into an iterative code that draws candidate sets of fitting parameters of chain elements from a given proposal distribution , and inserts the candidates into the chain if some proper statistical criterion is met .",
    "the sampling approach we used is the one proposed by metropolis and hastings @xcite . according to this scheme , each candidate set of parameters @xmath57",
    "is drawn from a gaussian centered over the previously accepted chain element @xmath58 .",
    "the width of the proposal distribution is a critical parameter of the code which determines the efficiency of the sampling algorithm ( i.e. the capability to sample from the multi - parameter posterior distribution in a given number of realizations , or acceptance rate ) and its ability to explore the full domain of the fitting parameters .",
    "different test runs of the mcmc code were needed to find the best tradeoff between acceptance rate and accuracy of the fit for given chain lengths , by adjusting the width of the proposal distributions . in the final configuration",
    ", the code was able to reconstruct the posteriors with @xmath59 acceptance rate and sufficient samplings of the parameter space were achieved in less than @xmath60 samplings .",
    "convergence of the mcmc runs was also tested through the gelman - rubin test @xcite which not only tests convergence but can also diagnose poor mixing .",
    "we have verified that the results are independent of the starting point in parameter space by performing multiple shorter runs of the code and confirming the statistical consistency of the results of the single runs .",
    "undersampling of the final chains was performed to reduce the self - correlation which is naturally induced in a sampled markov chain , and may therefore affect the estimate of sample variances for the different parameters .",
    "once we have the posteriors for the various parameters we can characterize the distributions in terms of the quantities of interest : expected value , mode , standard uncertainty , probability intervals .",
    "the above analysis has been performed for each cluster to derive @xmath0 .",
    "we present the results in terms of @xmath0 in table [ tab : tcmb ] , where we give expected values and standard deviations .",
    "note that @xmath0 at the cluster redshift is independent of the particular scaling assumed for the temperature ( i.e. the lima model in this case ) ; the only assumption made is that the frequency obeys the standard scaling , @xmath61 is valid .",
    "rather , the @xmath1 value is strictly related to the specific model under consideration .    by studying the correlations between the variables",
    ", we checked that the main degeneracies are between @xmath0 and @xmath15 , and @xmath0 and @xmath13 .",
    "in particular , given the actual level of low precision s - z measurements , only the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath13 is always evident .",
    "we verified this behaviour by simulating a dataset for a single cluster .",
    "we checked that , in order to reduce the impact of the degeneracy between @xmath0 and @xmath13 and then to reduce the uncertainty in the determination of @xmath0 , better knowledge of the peculiar velocity is required ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig : contourplot ] ) ) .",
    "we used two different priors for the peculiar velocity : one gaussian with vanishing mean and standard deviation @xmath31 km / s and the other gaussian with vanishing mean and standard deviation @xmath62 km / s .    to obtain @xmath1",
    "we have performed a fit of the @xmath0 data points .",
    "of course , since the distributions of @xmath0 for individual clusters are in general slightly non - gaussian and in addition they are frequently skewed , performing a best fit as if they were gaussian introduces a bias in the result .",
    "nevertheless we tested it is a good first approximation .",
    "the prior for @xmath1 is flat in the range @xmath63 $ ] , to account for the theoretical constraints of the model @xcite .      to obtain the results we report below we assumed the flat prior @xmath63",
    "$ ] . employing the ri approach we deduce the most probable value @xmath64 ; all errors in this section are at 68% confidence .",
    "as discussed earlier , the use of intensity ratios necessarily introduces bias in the inferred parameter , although we attempted to minimize the bias by selecting the measurement with the smallest fractional error to be in the denominator of the ratios for each cluster .",
    "the more precise the measurements , the weaker is this bias . to estimate the bias in this result we repeated the calculation with observational errors in values of @xmath4 ( used in the denominators ) reduced to very small ( relative ) levels , thereby isolating the impact of this systematic bias . doing so yields @xmath65 .",
    "thus , when compared with the value deduced from the actual data , @xmath64 , a bias level of @xmath66 is indeed a relatively small fraction of the statistical uncertainty , @xmath67 .",
    "the analysis was repeated employing the di approach , adopting a flat @xmath15 prior in the interval [ 0 , 0.05 ] .",
    "in the first direct 3d integrations treatment we obtain @xmath68 .",
    "the final alpha value we get by fitting the @xmath0 data points obtained with the mcmc treatment is @xmath69 . in order to check the efficiency of this method we have also considered the @xmath0 as deduced from line transitions observations ( mainly estimated by uv observations of interstellar clouds ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:_righe ] ) .",
    "the improvement on the constraints on @xmath1 is not substantial in spite of the wider redshift range ( as compared to the s - z data ) .",
    "the final alpha value we get by fitting the @xmath0 data points is @xmath70 . due to the shape of the posterior ( see fig . [",
    "fig : alphap ] ) as a consequence of the strong prior on @xmath1 , it is more meaningful to present this result as just an upper limit , i.e. @xmath71 at @xmath72 probability level .",
    "our three different treatments yield consistent results .",
    "more important , no significant evidence is found for a deviation from the redshift dependence of the cmb temperature predicted in the standard model .    in principle , the intensity - ratio approach to determine @xmath0 would seem preferable over the di method since dependence on @xmath15 is only second order , as compared with first order linear dependence on this quantity , which therefore needs to be marginalized over in the di method .",
    "this is so even if the former method is somewhat biased due to the arbitrariness in selecting the intensity change used in the denominator of the intensity ratios .",
    "our ri upper limit , @xmath73 at the 68% confidence level , is weaker than that obtained in the di analysis , @xmath74 ; this reflects the fact that the 68% confidence region is wider than the usual @xmath75 uncertainty region when the distribution is non - gaussian , such as the one we get with the ri approach . with more precise measurements , or - equivalently - a larger number of clusters , the distribution of ratios would approach a gaussian and",
    "would therefore be less affected by this bias .",
    "ongoing and near future surveys , including those planned with act , apex - sz , spt , and planck , as well as detailed s - z mapping of a sample of nearby clusters with the mad @xcite and balloon - borne olimpo @xcite experiments , will provide much more precise and uniform datasets that will largely remove the bias in the ri approach . while there is no such bias in the di approach",
    ", the marginalization over values of @xmath15 lowers the usefulness of this approach . on the other hand ,",
    "spatially resolved spectroscopic observations of galaxy clusters ( as proposed with the sagace satellite , a small mission project approved for phase a by the italian space agency ) would allow for breaking the degeneracy between @xmath0 and cluster parameters .",
    "by adopting a more general redshift scaling law that includes the prediction of the standard model when @xmath3 , we are able to test both adiabatic and non - adiabatic models . while we obtain somewhat different results for @xmath1 in the above three treatments , the degree of overlap of the respective uncertainty intervals implies that these values are statistically consistent . already with the current sample of 13 clusters with medium - quality s - z data , we are able to verify the standard scaling law at a good level of precision . more precise measurements of the @xmath0 scaling law",
    "could possibly have interesting ramifications on setting constraints on the variation of fundamental constants over cosmological time .",
