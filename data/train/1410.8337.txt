    "accordingly , the only non - vanishing weyl scalar is @xmath26 thereby the spacetime is of the petrov type d , and it possesses two congruences of null geodesics along the double principal null directions @xmath27 and @xmath28 , both being shearfree and non - twisting",

    "this mass function reduces to the bondi - sachs ( bs ) and adm masses in appropriate limits @xcite . specifically , one has @xmath36 which measures the mass on null hypersurfaces of constant @xmath21 .",

    "the case for @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be equally obtained by mapping @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 which leaves @xmath46 , the equations of motion and the metric ( [ metricr ] ) invariant .    in terms of the coordinate @xmath22 , the ricci scalar , as a curvature invariant , can be calculated by directly plugging ( [ rr ] ) into ( [ ricci ] ) .",

    "the energy - momentum tensor ( [ t ] ) for minimally coupled scalar fields with potentials always satisfies the null energy condition .",

    "furthermore , the solution we have described so far is closely related to the roberts solution @xcite for linear scalar fields without self - interaction potentials . to recover the latter , one only needs to reparameterize @xmath55 and take @xmath56 such that @xmath46 vanishes and the metric ( [ metricr ] ) becomes @xmath57 thereby we may follow roberts example @xcite in discussing various global aspects of our solution . comparisons between the two may also benefit our discussion . in this regard",

    ", one can resort to @xmath67 analogous to the wyman solution @xcite , the static solution itself also demonstrates a `` phase transition '' at the special value @xmath68 . a first clue for this is to look at the outgoing null geodesics emanated from the center : @xmath69 which indicates that the singularity is completely censored ( no light emitted ) if @xmath70 , but ( at least ) locally naked if @xmath71 .",
    "this relates to the fact that the central singularity is covered by an event horizon only when @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "similarly for the dynamical solution , the existence of an apparent horizon also relies on the sign of @xmath72 .",
    "the apparent horizon is determined by the root of @xmath73 . for a given @xmath74 ( also recall @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) , the metric function @xmath75 is strictly increasing from @xmath72 to @xmath76 as @xmath22 goes from @xmath77 to @xmath78 . hence",
    "a unique apparent horizon exists iff @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , the criticality of @xmath68 also presents itself in the misner - sharp mass function : @xmath79 the sign of @xmath80 above implies that the central singularity is timelike and untrapped for @xmath81 , and spacelike and trapped for @xmath82 @xcite .",

    "as one may expect , the event horizon extends beyond the null hypersurface @xmath47 into the initial flat region , which means that it comes to exist before the central singularity starts to form .",
    "this is a teleological feature also seen in the vaidya spacetime .",

    "for a small @xmath111 , the right - hand side of the above equation has the following generalized series expansion : @xmath114 ignoring higher order terms , we obtain an approximate scaling law for the black hole mass : @xmath115 this product - logarithmic relation ( lambert @xmath116-function ) is significantly different from the power law of choptuik .",
    "in addition , by a similar argument for small @xmath74 , we have also determined that the initial growth of the black hole mass follows @xmath117 which resembles the power law of the roberts solution for having the same exponent @xmath118 .",
    "the basic physical picture we have drawn so far is the following : an imploding scalar wave packet , with the spherical wave front ( located at the advanced time @xmath47 ) travelling inward at the speed of light , collides at the center of the 3-dimensional physical space . depending on the strength of the wave packet , it either forms a globally naked singularity in weak - field collapse , or a hairy black hole in strong - field collapse . in case of the latter , the formation of black holes always starts with zero mass . in both cases , the spacetime is becoming static as the collapse reaches its ending .",
    "meanwhile , the total mass stays finite .",
    "there also exists a critical case interpolating between these two dominant outcomes , of which the spacetime is sitting on the verge of containing a naked singularity or a black hole , but just avoiding both .",
    "the phenomenology of our model has unusual features , but it still fits into the basic picture of critical collapse .",
    "major deviations from previously known examples of critical phenomena are at least threefold : 1 ) the presence of naked singularities as the endstate of weak - field collapse instead of dispersal to infinity , 2 ) the absence of self - similarity in the critical case , 3 ) the product - logarithmic scaling law of the black hole mass in contrast to the usual power law .",
    "all these features may be attributed to the unbounded negative scalar potential . with",
    "the black hole mass being kept finite , our solution can also be considered as a `` regularized '' generalization of the roberts solution which has been thought unfavorable for not having an event horizon .    for future work , we point out that more is yet to be understood regarding the legitimacy and universality of the `` critical solution '' with @xmath68 .",
    "the stability of the solution also raises important questions .",
    "furthermore , our earlier paper @xcite also includes ds and ads generalizations of the solution ( [ metricr ] ) .",
    "it is expected that the local picture of the naked singularity / black hole formation may not be affected by the introduction of an effective cosmological constant , at least when the constant is small .",
    "nonetheless , the global structures will be quite different .",
    "perhaps more interestingly , the singularity / black hole `` phase transition '' in the ads background may be further examined in the context of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "without loss of generality , we consider a normalized timelike geodesic vector field @xmath119 such that @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "the weak energy condition can be expressed as @xmath122 with @xmath123 .",
    "the inequality holds true if the sum of the last two terms above is non - negative .",
    "given the solution ( [ metricr ] ) , we can estimate them as follows : @xmath124\\frac{q^2}{2r^4 }   + \\mathcal{o}(r^{-5}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second equality stands for a series expansion at @xmath125 .",
    "now consider the static limit @xmath58 in which case the ( negative ) leading term vanishes .",
    "the sum is thus dominated by @xmath126 for large @xmath54 .",
    "so the weak energy condition at least holds in this situation .",
    "another noteworthy situation is to consider a small neighborhood of the center @xmath30 , where we have @xmath127 the leading term indicates that for @xmath74 and @xmath85 , the weak energy condition is satisfied near the timelike central singularity in subcritical evolutions .",
    "in this section , we prove the ( local ) uniqueness of the constant solution @xmath97 for the null geodesic equation ( [ geo ] ) .",
    "because @xmath128 blows up at @xmath30 , the picard - lindelf theorem fails to apply .",
    "instead we will use the comparison theorem ( generalized gronwall s inequality ) for nonlinear first - order odes ( @xcite , see  9 ) . now consider a `` backward '' initial value problem ( ivp ) : @xmath129 where @xmath130 , given by ( [ h ] ) , is non - negative .",
    "all we need to show is that the solution to this ivp can never reach @xmath30 with @xmath131 , i.e. , @xmath132 .    for the critical case @xmath133 , the right - hand side of the equation",
    "is bounded above by @xmath134 with @xmath135 .",

    "then by the virtue of the comparison theorem , the solution of ( [ ivp ] ) is bounded below by @xmath143 this completes the proof .",
    "in this section , we show that the dynamical solution ( [ metricr ] ) is not self - similar , i.e. , that it does not admit a homothetic killing vector @xmath144 satisfying @xmath145 with @xmath146 a non - zero real constant . to see this , we first write down explicitly components of the above equation : @xmath147 note that the first two equations imply that @xmath148 , which , when combined with ( [ ke4 ] ) , yields @xmath149 then again from ( [ ke4 ] ) , one obtains @xmath150 .",
    "plugging them back in ( [ ke2 ] ) gives one @xmath151 which fails to hold if @xmath152 .",
