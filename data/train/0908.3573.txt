    "the observed universe is homogenous at very large scales but not at small ones where it contains numerous localized matter sources . within the well - tested @xcite theory of general relativity @xcite ,",
    "this means the geometry on large scales can be described by a metric of the friedman - robertson - walker type while at smaller scales it must be approximated by metrics of the schwarzschild or schwarzschild - de sitter forms .",
    "these idealized metrics can be derived from the equations of motion of general relativity by assuming different symmetries at the different scales .    it may be argued that when solving the equations of motion of general relativity in some symmetric sector , it is natural to consider the same symmetry for the geometry @xmath0 and stress - energy @xmath1 to which the geometry couples .",
    "accordingly , when assuming spatial homogeneity for the geometry , it is natural to take @xmath1 to contain one free function associated with the time direction and one free function associated with the spatial directions .",
    "a stress - tensor of this kind is said to be in perfect fluid form and can be written as [ tpf ] t^pf _ = ( + p)u_u_+ p g _ with @xmath2 a unit time - like vector , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 some functions called the energy density and pressure , respectively .",
    "in contrast , for static isotropic geometries , what is natural for @xmath1 is that it should have three independent functions - two associated with the time and radial directions , and one associated with the remaining two angular directions .",
    "a stress tensor of this type can be written as [ t_cmo ] t _",
    "= t_^pf + q v_v _ where the first term on the right hand side is of perfect fluid form ( [ tpf ] ) , and in the second term @xmath5 is a unit vector pointing in the radial direction and @xmath6 is some function .",
    "since the modification to the perfect fluid form comes only in the radial components of @xmath1 , a stress - energy tensor of this type may be called radially imperfect .",
    "in other terminology it may be said to contain viscous shear .",
    "it is the most general stress - energy tensor compatible with staticity and isotropy @xcite .    in principle",
    ", the stress - energy tensor can be calculated in any theory of matter coupled to gravity given a description of the matter distribution .",
    "recently , cox , mannheim , and obrien performed calculations of this kind assuming a matter component in the form of an incoherent collection of modes of a free ( minimally - coupled ) massless scalar field @xcite . reproducing earlier results",
    "@xcite , they showed that such a matter distribution puts the stress - energy tensor into the perfect fluid form when the background spacetime is minkowski .",
    "crucially , however , they also showed that the incoherent collection of field modes does not necessarily generate a perfect fluid stress - energy tensor if the background spacetime is nonhomogenous .",
    "in one analytic calculation involving a special static isotropic background , they put the stress - energy tensor into the form ( [ t_cmo ] ) and explicitly wrote the functional form for @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "this corroborates the motivation for using the general form ( [ t_cmo ] ) for the stress - tensor source when it is coupled to a static and isotropic geometry .",
    "the calculations in @xcite were done in the spirit of field theory on curved spacetime .",
    "that is , the background spacetime was assumed to be fixed .",
    "the approach was useful because it allowed those authors to determine the field modes explicitly , sum over them , and thus obtain the stress - energy tensor . from the nonperturbative point of view , however , it is important to take into account backreaction , i.e. to obtain a consistent solution to einstein equations with an imperfect fluid source .",
    "the observations in @xcite are a direct motivation for doing exactly that .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to study static and isotropic spacetimes coupled with the imperfect fluid stress - energy tensor ( [ t_cmo ] ) .",
    "a similar task has been attempted in @xcite but the issue is revisited here in more detail .",
    "attention is focused on describing spacetimes in which the imperfect fluid component is nonvanishing and comparing them to known solutions , like schwarzschild , in which this component is exactly zero .",
    "section [ s_static ] deals with einstein s equations for static and isotropic spacetimes coupled to certain fluids of the form ( [ t_cmo ] ) .",
    "although isotropy may in some systems also be thought to be an emergent property due to matter coupling @xcite , in this work it is imposed strongly .",
    "several solutions  modifications of the schwarzschild , anti - de sitter , and schwarzschild - de sitter spaces  are derived and their properties are discussed .",
    "then , some phenomenological aspects of the modified black - hole solution are studied in sec .",
    "[ s_pheno ] . since one aspect of the phenomenology is similar to that attributed to dark - matter in galaxies , sec .",

    "in units where the speed of light and the newton constant are set to one , the equations of motion of general relativity are g _ = 8 t _ with @xmath8 the einstein tensor derived from a metric @xmath0 , and @xmath1 the stress - energy tensor of matter @xcite .",
    "this section deals with solutions to these equations under the assumption that the geometry is static and isotropic ( spherically - symmetric ) and the stress tensor is in the radially - imperfect form ( [ t_cmo ] ) .    with the assumed symmetries ,",

    "( the constant @xmath24 should not be confused with the speed of light which is set to one throughout by a choice of units . ) these functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 determine the metric . when they are inserted into ( [ grr_sc ] ) ,",
    "they determine the imperfect fluid component to be q = . [ qbh ]    if the imperfect fluid component is required to vanish , then the constant @xmath24 must be set to zero .",
    "when @xmath14 in ( [ hbhsol ] ) and @xmath13 in ( [ fbhsol ] ) with @xmath27 are inserted into ( [ ds2_sc ] ) , they yield the schwarzschild line - element with an additional numeric constant @xmath28 in front of the @xmath29 component . because of reparametrization invariance",
    ", this constant can be set to unity without loss of generality .",
    "thus the standard black hole solution , with a horizon at the schwarzschild radius @xmath30 and a singularity at @xmath31 , is recovered .    if @xmath32 , the coefficient of @xmath33 in the line element remains identical as in the schwarzschild spacetime . in this sense",

    "the scaling makes the setup somewhat contrived but also falsifiable .    that a new term in the stress - energy tensor can produce new phenomenology should not in itself be surprising",
