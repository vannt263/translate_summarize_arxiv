    "the discovery of topological insulator has infused great enthusiasm in finding new materials with novel topological properties.@xcite one particularly exciting subject is how to realize majorana fermions , which is not only of fundamental interest but also has potential application in fault - tolerant topological quantum computation.@xcite among many schemes proposed up - to - date@xcite , the heterostructure consisting of a semiconductor clamped between a magnetic insulator and an @xmath0-wave superconductor appears to be the most promising one@xcite .",
    "the spin - splitting of the fermi surface of the semiconductor by the rashba spin - orbit coupling ( rsoc ) and the existence of an out - of - plane zeeman field are essential ingredients of the scheme .",
    "similar mechanism has also been proposed in cold atom systems.@xcite an alternative system , a heterostructure consisting of a half - metal ( hm ) and an @xmath0-wave superconductor ( @xmath0sc ) containing the same essential physical ingredients has also been studied.@xcite    in existing hybrid solid - state systems proposed to host the topological superconducting phase and the majorana fermions , the magnetization ( exchange field ) is required to be perpendicular to the spin of the charge carriers fixed by the soc.@xcite in the hm/@xmath0sc heterostructure , however , there is an intrinsic degree of freedom in directing the magnetization of the hm thin film , as shown schematically in fig.1 .",
    "this is achieved either by cutting the thin film along different high symmetry directions of the bulk parent material , or through a magnetic field when the magnetic anisotropy of the parent hm is small .",
    "for an ideal hm without soc , there exists @xmath1 symmetry with respect to the simultaneous rotation of the magnetization and the electron spin . the above tunability generates no physical difference as the exchange field or the magnetization changes its directions .",
    "however , the formation of heterostructure with the substrate and the superconductor enforces the inversion asymmetry to the hm thin film along the normal direction of the film .",
    "the ensuing rsoc breaks the above @xmath1 symmetry.@xcite in the presence of the rsoc , the physics associated with a general orientation of the magnetization so far has not been examined in the proposed heterostructure .",

    "to probe possible phases in the hm/@xmath0sc heterostructure with different orientations of the magnetization , we have calculated the energy spectra for both the bulk material and a strip of 500 unit cells with two edges running along the @xmath51 direction .",

    "correspondingly , one of the two chiral edge modes becomes flat ( fig.2(f ) ) .",
    "this critical point @xmath57 is determined approximately in the limit of @xmath58 and @xmath59 by @xmath60 see appendix b for more details of the derivation of eq.(3 ) .",
    "increasing @xmath3 further , the energy overlap between the two low - energy quasiparticle bands increases ( fig.2(c ) ) , and the two chiral edge modes become unidirectional ( fig.2(g ) ) .",
    "then at @xmath37 , not only the bulk gap is absent , the local gap also closes at two nodes along the @xmath61 direction ( fig.2(d ) ) , and the two edge modes become degenerate ( fig.2(h ) ) .",
    "since the two low - energy quasiparticle bands are nondegenerate , the appearance of the two nodes and the conelike dispersion close to them ( see appendix b for more details ) indicates the showing up of a 2d weyl superconductivity phase.@xcite the presence of only two weyl nodes at different energies are consistent with the fact that both time - reversal symmetry and inversion symmetry are broken.@xcite the phase changes in the other ranges of @xmath3 are qualitatively similar .",
    "more spectral properties of the edge states which are relevant to the experimental detection of various phases can be found in appendix c.    in what follows , we identify the underlying bulk topological invariants relevant to the phase transitions found above .",
    "the properties of the weyl superconductivity phase will be analyzed later ( see also appendix b ) . in an earlier work by ghosh _",
    "et al _ , a pfaffian @xmath62 invariant for the 2d semiconductor heterostructure was introduced from the particle - hole symmetry.@xcite since our system is also 2d and particle - hole symmetric , the same pfaffian @xmath62 invariant can be defined , which turns out to be @xmath63,\\ ] ] where @xmath64 , the function @xmath65 gives the sign of a real number @xmath46 .",

    "the phase is nontrivial ( trivial ) if @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "clearly , the above pfaffian invariant depends only on the magnitude @xmath2 of the exchange field and is blind to the angle @xmath3 . according to eq.(4 ) , we would have a single topological phase for all @xmath3 once @xmath69.@xcite this is different from what we predicted for the global - gapless phases in figs . 2(g ) and 2(h )",
    ". therefore we have to find some finer criteria , if any , to discriminate the different phases in fig.2 .    because time - reversal symmetry is broken in the present 2d system , a natural topological invariant to consider is the chern number .",
    "one way of calculating the chern number is through the tknn ( thouless - kohmoto - nightingale - den nijs ) formula @xcite @xmath70 where the berry connection is defined as @xmath71 , with @xmath72 the eigenvector of the @xmath30-th quasiparticle band .",
    "we call @xmath73 obtained from eq.(5 ) as the tknn number , which gives the hall conductance of the model ( in unit of @xmath74 ) .",
    "since a local gap exists between all consecutive pairs of the four quasiparticle bands for all @xmath3 except @xmath75 and @xmath38 , we are motivated to define another set of chern numbers related to the respective quasiparticle bands .",
    "define the berry connection for the @xmath30-th quasiparticle band as @xmath76 , the chern number for the @xmath30-th quasiparticle band is defined as @xmath77    when a bulk gap throughout the bz is present , the tknn number is just a summation over the chern numbers of the two negative energy quasiparticle bands , @xmath78 . for the present model @xmath79 , thus @xmath80 .",
    "however , such a simple relationship breaks down when the two low - energy quasiparticle bands ( @xmath81 ) overlap in energy .",
    "an explicit calculation of @xmath73 and @xmath82 @xcite shows that , upon crossing the transition point from the bulk gapped phase to the bulk gapless phase , @xmath73 changes from an integer to a nonintegral value but @xmath82 remains quantized ( fig.3(a ) ) . as we tilt the exchange field continuously to the in - plane direction , @xmath73 continuously approaches zero and @xmath82 remains quantized until the exchange field lies _ exactly _ along the in - plane direction ( @xmath37 or @xmath38 ) . by crossing the nodal weyl superconductivity phase , when the @xmath83 component of the exchange field changes sign , the band - wise chern numbers @xmath82 for the two low - energy quasiparticle bands ( @xmath81 ) also change sign ( fig.3(a ) ) . in the weyl superconductivity phase ,",
    "the weyl nodes make the band - wise chern number of the two low - energy quasiparticle bands ill - defined . and",
    "thus no results for @xmath82 ( @xmath81 ) are shown in fig.3(a ) for @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , we have shown that while the bulk gapped phase is characterized by both the quantized tknn number and the quantized band - wise chern number , the bulk gapless phase with a local gap is characterized by a nonintegral tknn number and a quantized band - wise chern number .",
    "the weyl superconductivity phase is a quantum critical point separating two bulk gapless phases with opposite quantized band - wise chern numbers .",
    "the tknn number shown in fig.3(a ) can be detected by the thermal hall effect , which is a transverse thermal current in response to a longitudinal temperature gradient .",

    "it is well - known that , accidental band degeneracies in 2d are vanishingly improbable if no symmetry constraint exists.@xcite it is thus highly desirable to know whether the weyl nodes in the present system are ensured by a symmetry .",

    ", the protection of superconducting gap nodes along mirror invariant lines ( 2d ) or planes ( 3d ) is a very robust feature and should be applicable to other relevant systems .    for 3d weyl semimetal",
    ", the existence of the fermi arc can be understood from the quantized chern number defined in a reduced 2d subspace of the 3d bz.@xcite in a similar sense , the fermi line on the edge of the present 2d sample is found to be associated with a quantized topological invariant defined in the reduced 1d subspace of the 2d bz .",
    "this topological invariant is the zak phase.@xcite by taking @xmath93 as a parameter , the zak phase for the @xmath30-th quasiparticle band is defined as @xmath120 for @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the mirror symmetry acts effectively as inversion symmetry for the quasi-1d model at each fixed @xmath93 . the zak phase in this case is known to take either of two quantized values , @xmath121 or @xmath122.@xcite as shown in fig.3(b ) and in comparison to fig.2(h ) , the edge state exists when the zak phase takes the nontrivial value of @xmath122 .",
    "thus , the edge states can be regarded as the end states of the quasi-1d model .",
    "the weyl nodes act as phase boundaries separating two regions with @xmath121 and @xmath122 zak phase .",
    "the correspondence between zak phase and the existence of edge states was also pointed out in graphene.@xcite",
    "to observe the predicted topological phase transitions and intermediate weyl superconductivity phase , it is crucial to have high quality hm thin films with a single spin - nondegenerate band at the fermi surface .",
    "fortunately , this has been shown by chung _ et al _ to be achievable in several thin film materials , including atomically thin films of vte , crte , and cro@xmath123.@xcite in addition , a hydrogenated graphene c@xmath124h@xmath125 with slight electron doping is predicted recently to be a 2d hm with a single electron pocket around the @xmath126 point.@xcite this ideal 2d material provides a perfect playground to realize the predictions in the present work .",
    "besides the materials mentioned above , it is still an open question whether a simple fermi surface with a single spin - polarized band can be obtained in other materials .",
    "the possibility could be manganites@xcite , double perovskites like sr@xmath123femoo@xmath124@xcite , and electron - doped hgcr@xmath123se@xmath127@xcite .",
    "another important requirement to be satisfied is the possibility to tune the direction of the spontaneous magnetization , @xmath3 . in principle , this can be achieved by two kinds of methods depending on the specific material . if the magnetic anisotropy of the material is small , @xmath3 can be tuned over a large range with an external magnetic field above the superconducting transition temperature . in this case , all the phase transitions together with the intermediate weyl superconductivity phase can be observed .",
    "on the other hand , for a material with large magnetic anisotropy , @xmath3 can still be tuned by controlling the direction along which the thin film is cut from the bulk hm . though only some particular @xmath3 can be attained in this case , some typical examples of the different phases can still be observed .",
    "in particular , since the easy axis of the magnetization is usually along a high symmetry direction , the condition for the realization of the weyl superconductivity phase can still be fulfilled .",
    "finally , since the heterostructure consisting of a ferromagnet and a superconductor is a standard element in the superconducting spintronics , a great deal of experimental experiences have been accumulated.@xcite besides , the issue of choosing a proper substrate to generate a large rsoc is also a mature field.@xcite thus , our predictions should have good prospect to be realized by experiments in the near future .",
    "to summarize , we have found topological phase transitions in a hm/@xmath0sc heterostructure as the orientation of the magnetization varies .",
    "while the transition between a fully gapped phase and a gapless phase can be distinguished by a change in the tknn number , the transition between the gapless phase with a local gap and a weyl superconductivity phase is captured by a band - wise chern number .",
    "the protection of the weyl superconductivity phase by an emergent mirror symmetry is established .",
    "the position of the weyl nodes and the existence of fermi line edge states are captured by the zak phase defined in the 1d subspace of the 2d bz . in order for our predictions to be confirmed by future experiments , it is important to seek the materials to form the hm/@xmath0sc heterstructure .",

    "because the pairing amplitude is usually much smaller than other important energy scales in the problem , such as the chemical potential and the exchange field in the present hm , only the low - energy spin - polarized band which crosses the chemical potential ( thus contributing to the fermi surface ) is important in the analysis of the physical properties . a simplified approach of studying the low - energy physics is to project the original model containing information both of the high - energy band and of the low - energy band to an effective model retaining only information of the low - energy band.@xcite in this section",

    "the superconducting gap opens along the fermi circle determined by @xmath175 . since @xmath166 is symmetrical in @xmath176 , the transition is driven by the qualitative change of the quasiparticle spectrum along the @xmath177 direction .",
    "thus , we focus on the line @xmath178",
    ". the two fermi points in this direction that lie on the fermi circle are determined by @xmath179 focusing on the limit of @xmath58 , we can make a taylor expansion of the square roots in eq.(b9 ) over @xmath14 and keep the leading order terms and gets @xmath180 among the two solutions to @xmath181 from the above equation , @xmath182 the physical one is clearly the one corresponding to the minus sign .",

    "note that eq.(b15 ) gives the approximate values of all the four critical angles ( in the whole range of @xmath195 ) which separate the bulk gapped phase and the bulk gapless phase with a ubiquitous local gap .",
    "in the main text , we have proved that the emergent mirror symmetry for @xmath37 ( and also for @xmath196 ) ensures the presence of weyl nodes along the mirror invariant lines which cross the fermi circle . here",

    "the weyl points are determined by the condition of @xmath207 , which gives approximately for @xmath58 @xmath183 for the parameters that we focus on , the above equation gives us a pair of solutions which correspond to the two weyl nodes at @xmath208 and @xmath209.\\ ] ]    introducing the relative momenta @xmath210 and @xmath211 close to the weyl node @xmath185 , the low - energy effective model can be written in terms of @xmath210 and @xmath211 by making series expansions to the terms in @xmath212 and retaining the leading order terms .",
    "the result turns out to be @xmath213 where @xmath214 @xmath215 @xmath216 and @xmath217 in the presence of the @xmath218 term , on one hand the two weyl nodes have different energies , on the other hand the two cones are tilted along the @xmath93 direction , which are both clear from fig.2(d ) of the main text .",
    "@xmath219 is consistent with our conclusion in the main text that the effective pairing amplitude vanishes along the @xmath61 direction , which is ensured by the mirror reflection symmetry .",
    "the coefficient of the @xmath220 term , @xmath221 , has opposite sign for the two nodes .",
    "therefore , we can define the chirality for the two weyl nodes as @xmath222 , which takes the value of @xmath223 and @xmath155 for the two nodes .",
    "in figs.2(e)-e(h ) of the main text , we have shown the energy spectra for strips of the system at several typical values of @xmath3 .",
    "the chiral edge states traversing the ( local ) gap are seen clearly . on the other hand ,",
    "the experimentally relevant quantity related to the edge states are the spectral function for the edge layers , rather than the full quasiparticle spectrum . in this section ,",
    "we give more numerical results on the experimentally relevant spectroscopic properties of the chiral majorana edge states .",

    "the spectral function is defined as imaginary part of the retarded green s function for states on the edge layers .",
