    "in this paper we consider a class of quasilinear ( possibly degenerate ) elliptic systems in @xmath3 .",
    "we prove that , under suitable assumptions , the solutions have one - dimensional symmetry , showing that the results obtained in @xcite hold in a more general setting .    in @xcite",
    "the following problem has been studied : @xmath4 the authors proved the existence , symmetry and nondegeneracy of the solution to problem in @xmath5 ; in particular , they showed that entire solutions are reflectionally symmetric , namely that there exists @xmath6 such that @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , they estabilished a result that may be considered the analogue of a famous conjecture of de giorgi for problem in dimension @xmath8 , that is they proved that monotone solutions of in @xmath2 have one - dimensional symmetry under the additional growth condition @xmath9 on the other hand , in @xcite , it has been proved that the linear growth is the lowest possible for solutions to ; in other words , if there exists @xmath10 such that @xmath11 then @xmath12 .    in @xcite the authors proved that the above mentioned one - dimensional symmetry still holds in @xmath2 when the monotonicity condition is replaced by the stability of the solutions ( which is a weaker assumption ) .",
    "moreover , they showed that there exist solutions to which do not satisfy the growth condition , by constructing solutions with polynomial growth .",
    "moreover , we mention the paper @xcite , where the author proved that , for any @xmath13 , a solution to which is a local minimizer and satisfies the growth condition has one - dimensional symmetry .    in this paper we consider a more general setting , that is we take @xmath14 , and we study the following elliptic system in  @xmath3 @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the derivatives of @xmath18 with respect to the first and the second variable respectively .    we suppose that @xmath19 satisfy the following conditions : @xmath20 @xmath21    we define @xmath22 by setting , for any @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25    now , for any @xmath26 , we introduce the following notation : @xmath27 @xmath28 and we define @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we will require that @xmath32 satisfies ( a1 ) or ( a2 ) , where :    * @xmath33 and @xmath34 * we have that @xmath35 and @xmath36    moreover , we require the same properties for @xmath37 :    * @xmath38 and @xmath39 * we have that @xmath40 and @xmath41    in case ( a2 ) and ( b2 ) hold , we define @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "these assumptions may look rather technical at a first glance , but they are the standard conditions that comprise as particular cases the classical elliptic degenerate and nonlinear operators , such as the @xmath44-laplacian and the mean curvature operator .    in order to state our main result , we give the definition of monotone and stable solution .",
    "[ monsol ] we say that a solution  @xmath45 of   satisfies a _ monotonicity condition _ if @xmath46    [ stablesol ] when @xmath47 we say that a solution  @xmath45 of   is _ stable _ if the linearization is weakly positive definite , that is , for any  @xmath48 , @xmath49    in our general framework , since @xmath16 and @xmath17 may not be everywhere differentiable , the integral in may not be well defined .",
    "therefore it is convenient to introduce the sets @xmath50 and @xmath51 it is known that @xmath52 ( see pages 8182 in @xcite )",
    ". moreover , we consider the sets @xmath53 so we say that @xmath54 is a stable solution to , if for any @xmath48 , @xmath55 of course , reduces to when @xmath18 is in @xmath56 .",
    "then , we state our symmetry result . for this , we denote by  @xmath57 the image of the map  @xmath58 , i.e. @xmath59 .    [ t1d ] let  @xmath45 be a solution of  .",
    "suppose that  @xmath60 ,  @xmath61 , and  @xmath62 .",
    "suppose that either ( a2 ) holds or that  @xmath63 , and that either ( b2 ) holds or that  @xmath64 .",
    "assume that either @xmath65 or @xmath66 if @xmath67 then  @xmath45 has one - dimensional symmetry , in the sense that there exist  @xmath68 and  @xmath69 in such a way that   @xmath70 , for any  @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , if we assume in addition that either @xmath72 or @xmath73 then  @xmath45 has one - dimensional symmetry , and @xmath74 .",
    "notice that the hypothesis that  @xmath75 is not identically zero can not be removed if we want to conclude that  @xmath76 have one - dimensional symmetry with the same unit vector  @xmath77 .",
    "indeed , in  @xmath2 one can consider the system in with the laplace operator and  @xmath78 . then",
    ", if one take the functions  @xmath79 and  @xmath80 , it is easy to see that  @xmath54 is a monotone and stable solution to and , and are satisfied , but  @xmath81 and  @xmath82 have one - dimensional symmetry with a different vector  @xmath77 .",
    "notice also that one can consider a more general function @xmath18 such that  @xmath83 , that is a system with two independent equations , and there is no reason why  @xmath81 and  @xmath82 should have one - dimensional symmetry with the same vector .",
    "we notice that , as paradigmatic examples satisfying the assumptions of theorem [ t1d ] , one may take the @xmath44-laplacian , with @xmath84 if @xmath85 and any @xmath86 if @xmath87 ( in this case , for instance , @xmath88 ) or the mean curvature operator ( in this case , @xmath89 ) .",
    "moreover , we observe that theorem [ t1d ] holds even if @xmath32 and @xmath37 are two different functions satisfying the hypotheses ( e.g. , one can take @xmath32 to be of @xmath44-laplacian type and @xmath37 of mean curvature type ) .    to prove theorem [ t1d ] we borrow a large number of ideas from @xcite and @xcite , and exploit some techniques of @xcite . in particular , we will show that a formula proved in @xcite and its extension obtained in @xcite for elliptic equations still hold for systems ( see corollaries [ cor1 ] and [ cor2 ] ) .",
    "since this formula bounds a weighted @xmath90-norm of any test function by a weighted @xmath90-norm of its gradient , we may see it as a weighted poincar type inequality .",
    "such a formula is geometric in spirit , since it bounds tangential gradients and curvatures of level sets of monotone and stable solutions in terms of suitable energy integrals .",
    "our result extends the one obtained in @xcite , where the authors studied problem in the case @xmath91 , and use this kind of geometric poincar inequality to show that in @xmath2 any stable solution has a one - dimensional symmetry .",
    "of course in our setting several technical and conceptual complications arise due to the possible degeneracy of the operators considered and to the nonlinear dependence on the gradient terms .",
    "moreover , as a particular case , theorem [ t1d ] comprises a conjecture of de giorgi for phase separations in @xmath2 ( see the end of section [ sec : appl ] ) .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a recent review on the conjecture of de giorgi and related topics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : useful ] we collect some preliminary material .",
    "sections [ sec : mon ] and [ sec : stable ] are devoted to show that some geometric poincar type inequalities hold for monotone and stable solutions to respectively . in section [ sec : levset ]",
    "we develop the level set analysis . in section [ sec :",
    "proof ] we provide the proof of theorem [ t1d ] , by using the results obtained in the previous sections .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : appl ] , we give an application of theorem [ t1d ] , namely we prove that a conjecture of de giorgi holds in @xmath2 for systems like , and in particular for phase separations .",
    "in this section we collect some results that we will use in the sequel .    first , we have the following lemma ( see lemma 2.1 in @xcite for a simple proof ) :    [ lemma1 ] for any @xmath92 , the matrices @xmath93 , @xmath94 are symmetric and positive definite , and their eigenvalues are @xmath95 and @xmath96 respectively .",
    "moreover @xmath97    it follows from lemma [ lemma1 ] that , for any @xmath98 , @xmath99 moreover , for any @xmath100 , and any @xmath92 ,",
    "@xmath101 @xmath102    [ lemma2 ] let @xmath45 be a weak solution of ( [ system ] ) such that @xmath103 , @xmath104 , with @xmath105 .",
    "suppose that either ( a2 ) holds or that @xmath106 , and that either ( b2 ) holds or that @xmath107 .",
    "then , for any @xmath108 , @xmath109 is a weak solution of @xmath110    first of all , we observe that @xmath111 and @xmath112 let us show .",
    "it is obvious if @xmath33 , while , if ( a2 ) holds , we have that the map @xmath113 belongs to @xmath114 , and so follows by writing @xmath115 . in the same way one shows .    from and",
    ", we have that , for any @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118    moreover , by and stampacchia s theorem ( see , for instance , theorem 6.19 of @xcite ) , we get that @xmath119 for almost any @xmath120 , that is @xmath121 for almost any @xmath122 .    similarly , by using again stampacchia s theorem and ( a2 ) , we conclude that @xmath123 , and then @xmath124 , for almost any @xmath125 .",
    "a direct computation also shows that on @xmath126 @xmath127    as a consequence , @xmath128 almost everywhere .",
    "reasoning in the same way , we conclude also that @xmath129 almost everywhere .    let now @xmath130 .",
    "we use the above observations to obtain that @xmath131 and @xmath132 which vanish , since @xmath54 is a weak solution of .",
    "we observe that in the proof of lemma [ lemma2 ] it is sufficient to assume that @xmath133 .",
    "since such a generality is not needed here , we assumed , for simplicity , @xmath62 in order to use the above result in the sequel .",
    "let us notice that means that , for any @xmath134 , and for any  @xmath135 , @xmath136 since the integrals in may not be well defined , recalling the definitions of the sets @xmath137 given in the introduction and using we can say that  @xmath138 satisfies @xmath139    in the sequel we will need to use for a less regular test functions . to do this , we prove the following :    [ lemma2bis ] under the assumptions of lemma [ lemma2 ] , we have that holds for any  @xmath108 , any  @xmath140 and any ball  @xmath141 .",
    "let us prove the first equality in  .",
    "given  @xmath142 , we consider a sequence of functions  @xmath143 which converge to  @xmath144 in  @xmath145 .",
    "let  @xmath146 and  @xmath147 ( respectively  @xmath148 and  @xmath149 ) be the minimun and the maximum of  @xmath150 ( respectively  @xmath151 ) on the closure of  @xmath152",
    ". moreover , let @xmath153 notice that  @xmath154 , since  @xmath155 ; in fact , if  @xmath63 , then @xmath156 , whereas , if ( a2 ) holds , then  @xmath157 .",
    "in the same way , one has that also  @xmath158 .",
    "now , since the assumptions of lemma  [ lemma2 ] hold , we deduce from   @xmath159 also , @xmath160 which tends to zero as  @xmath161 tends to infinity , because of the assumptions on  @xmath76 . the latter consideration and",

    "reasoning in a similar way , we obtain also the second equality in  .",
    "we will now consider the _",
