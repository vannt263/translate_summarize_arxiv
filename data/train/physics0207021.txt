    "the problem of test particle diffusion in stochastic magnetic fields was studied by many authors @xcite-@xcite and important progress was obtained .",

    "particle trajectories in a magnetized plasma are determined by three stochastic processes : the magnetic field , the collisional velocity along magnetic lines and the collisional velocity perpendicular to the magnetic lines .",
    "these components of the stochastic collisional velocities have very different effects .",
    "there are two important difficulties appearing in this triple stochastic process .",
    "one is related to the parallel collisional velocity which enters as a multiplicative noise in the equations of motion and the other with the lagrangian non - linearity which is determined by the space dependence of the stochastic magnetic field .",
    "each of these two problems has been recently studied but only considered separately .",
    "the complete model for particle transport in stochastic magnetic fields could not be analyzed until now .",
    "the latter difficulty can be eliminated if one restricts the study to stochastic magnetic fields with small amplitudes and/or large perpendicular correlation lengths for which the magnetic kubo number ( defined below ) is small .",
    "if the perpendicular collisional velocity is neglected , this quasilinear problem has an exact solution that was obtained by several methods @xcite .",
    "it shows that the parallel collisional motion determines a subdiffusive transport across the confining magnetic field with the running diffusion coefficient @xmath0 decaying to zero as @xmath1  it was shown @xcite that this subdiffusive transport is due to collision induced trajectory trapping along the magnetic lines .",
    "the parallel collisional velocity forces the particles to return in the already visited positions along the magnetic lines and consequently generates long time lagrangian correlation of the stochastic magnetic field . if the perpendicular collisional velocity is taken into account , the transport is diffusive and the diffusion coefficient was evaluated semi - qualitatively by several methods @xcite-@xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the lagrangian non - linearity determined by the space - dependence of the stochastic magnetic field leads , at large magnetic kubo numbers , to magnetic line trapping and generation of stochastic magnetic islands .",
    "this process is mathematically identical with the trajectory trapping in the @xmath2 drift motion in an electrostatic turbulence .",
    "the latter was recently studied by means of a new statistical approach , the decorrelation trajectory method @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the general problem of collisional particle diffusion in stochastic magnetic fields in the guiding center approximation .",
    "more specifically , we determine the effect of self - consistent generation of stochastic magnetic islands on the effective transport .",
    "the running diffusion coefficient is determined for arbitrary parameters of the stochastic magnetic field and of particle collisions .",

    "the physical model is described in section 2 .",
    "we derive in section 3 the lagrangian velocity correlation and the running diffusion coefficient for arbitrary values of the four specific parameters and for given eulerian correlation of the potential .",

    "it is determined by the parallel motion and more exactly by the collisions which force the particles to return on the magnetic lines .",
    "this is reflected in the decorrelation trajectories , which all evolve back on their paths in the perpendicular plane at @xmath259 . in the absence of the magnetic line trapping ( quasilinear conditions ) this leads to the decay of the running diffusion coefficient because the perpendicular displacement decreases in time and thus @xmath258 decays at @xmath259 .",
    "the effect is inverse in the presence of stochastic magnetic islands .",
    "the backward motion produces first the un - mixing of the contribution of the trajectories that evolve on trapped magnetic lines .  as time increases",
    ", the contributions of smaller and smaller magnetic islands are recovered in the lagrangian velocity correlation .",
    "the effect of magnetic line trapping that produced the decay of @xmath0 in the interval @xmath260 is washed out by the backward motion and @xmath0 recovers its value at @xmath261  at this moment @xmath262 the correlation built - up time , @xmath0  has a maximum .",
    "a positive bump appears in the lagrangian velocity correlation due to the trajectories unwinding around the magnetic islands .",
    "finally , all decorrelation trajectories are  in phase  and approach the origin .",
    "this corresponds to the asymptotic regime in the evolution of the diffusion coefficient @xmath0 which is the same as for @xmath226 thus , the parallel collisional motion eliminates asymptotically the nonlinearity determined by the @xmath89-dependence of the magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "the above evolution of the diffusion appears whenever @xmath263 and since @xmath264 and @xmath265 the condition is @xmath266 which corresponds to magnetic line  trapping .",
    "when @xmath267 ( or @xmath268 the diffusion coefficient is given by eq.([dql ] ) .",
    "we show in the next sections that this rather nontrivial evolution of the running diffusion coefficient leads to anomalous diffusion regimes when a decorrelation mechanism is present .",
    "we analyze in this section the effect of the cross - field collisional diffusion ( @xmath269 starting from the general solution ( [ lsf])-([dint ] ) .",
    "the stochastic collisional velocity @xmath270 in eq.([1-x ] ) moves the particles out of the magnetic lines and consequently it has a decorrelation effect leading to diffusive transport .",
    "this collisional motion determines a characteristic time , the perpendicular decorrelation time @xmath271 it is defined by the condition that the collisional diffusion covers the perpendicular correlation length , @xmath272 and in the units chosen here it is @xmath273 the stochastic magnetic field is considered here to be static ( @xmath274 for a better understanding of the collisional decorrelation .    as in the previous section , a stochastic magnetic field with small kubo number @xmath275 that does not generate stochastic magnetic islands",
    "is first considered .",
    "we show analytically that the already known results are reproduced by the decorrelation trajectory method",
    ".  then the nonlinear case is analyzed and new anomalous diffusion regimes are found .",
    "they are determined by the non - linear interaction of the magnetic line trapping with the cross - field collisional diffusion .    in 1979",
    "kadomtsev and pogutse @xcite derived semi - qualitatively an approximation for the cross - field diffusion coefficient .",
    "this approximation is essentially a weak - nonlinearity regime , in which the magnetic field fluctuations are non - chaotic .",
    "it will be shown that this diffusion coefficient is obtained from the general equations ( [ lsf])-([dint ] ) provided that @xmath276 this condition is compatible with the relations found in @xcite where a detailed study of the diffusion regimes in stochastic magnetic fields for fusion plasmas is presented . in this conditions",
    "the @xmath277-dependence of the average velocity in eqs.([dectrx ] ) , ( [ dectr3 ] ) can be neglected and the equations for the decorrelation trajectories are ( [ tro ] ) corrected by a factor @xmath278 that multiplies the right hand side terms .",
    "this leads to the following form of the lagrangian velocity correlation    @xmath279    where @xmath280 is the subdiffusive lagrangian velocity autocorrelation defined in eq .",
    "( [ lql ] ) . because of the factor @xmath281 , the integral of @xmath282 no longer vanishes , and yields a finite diffusion coefficient , @xmath283 .",
    "it can be estimated analytically by using a step approximation of the function @xmath284    @xmath285    it then follows that the diffusion coefficient is approximated as :    @xmath286    because the integral of @xmath280 from @xmath287 to infinity is zero . using the very simple asymptotic form of @xmath280 [ obtained from eq.([lql ] ) for @xmath288 , the integral can be calculated analytically and one obtains ( going to dimensional quantities )    @xmath289    which is the well - known kadomtsev - pogutse formula .    when the time of flight @xmath290 is smaller than the decorrelation time @xmath291 the space dependence of the magnetic field fluctuations can not be neglected .",
    "it leads to stochastic magnetic islands . in the presence of a perpendicular collisional diffusivity the decorrelation trajectories obtained from eq.([dectr3 ] )",
    "are not more closed curves .",
    "however , trajectory winding can still be observed for some range of the parameters that define the subensembles .",
    "this means that the process of generation of  stochastic magnetic island and of magnetic line trapping still exists .",
    "compared to the decorrelation trajectories obtained with @xmath292 these trajectories saturate faster and perform a smaller number of rotations .",
    "they still turn back at the maximum of the function @xmath293 which shows that the parallel trapping determined by the parallel collisional motion still exists .",
    "but due to the cross field collisional diffusion , these two trapping processes are only approximate or temporary .",
    "the perpendicular diffusion @xmath294 produces a releasing effect both for perpendicular and parallel components of particle motion .",
    "the asymptotic values of the decorrelation trajectories are not concentrated in the origin ( as for @xmath295 but spread in the @xmath296 plane .",
    "consequently , a finite value of the asymptotic diffusion coefficient yields from eq.([dif ] ) .    the asymptotic diffusion coefficient is determined from eq.([dif ] ) using the numerical code we have developed .",
    "some results are presented in figure 3 where the asymptotic value of @xmath0 is represented as a function of @xmath297 the two components @xmath298 and @xmath299 are also represented .",
    "one can see that at small collisional diffusion @xmath300 , the non - linear interaction term largely dominates the collisional term while at large collisional diffusion @xmath301 the nonlinear term is only a correction to @xmath302 thus , the subdiffusive transport appearing at @xmath303 is transformed by a small collisional cross field diffusion into a diffusive transport with a diffusion coefficient that can be several orders of magnitude larger than @xmath302 the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on @xmath185 is rather nontrivial",
    ". there is at very small @xmath185 an increase of @xmath304 up to a maximum which corresponds to @xmath305 then , at larger @xmath306 the nonlinear interaction of the parallel and perpendicular trapping with the collisional decorrelation generates a strange transport regime , in which the effective diffusion coefficient decreases as the collisional diffusion @xmath299 increases .",
    "a minimum of @xmath304 is obtained",
    "when @xmath307 determines a decorrelation time of the order of the return time of the parallel motion , @xmath308 at larger @xmath309 ( when @xmath310 the nonlinear contribution @xmath298 increases again with the increase of @xmath307 but this contribution begins to be comparable and eventually negligible compared to the collisional diffusion coefficient .",
    "we note that the above results obtained with the decorrelation trajectory method are not similar with the heuristic estimation of the asymptotic diffusion coefficient of rechester and rosenbluth @xcite .",
    "this is possibly due to the fact that the trapping of the magnetic lines , which is profoundly implied in the above results , is neglected in the estimation @xcite and also in the more detailed calculations presented in @xcite .",
    "this estimation is based on the process of exponential increase of the average distance between two magnetic lines in a chaotic magnetic field , represented by the kolmogorov length .",
    "the estimation of this length taking into account the trapping of the magnetic lines should be necessary in order to compare the results .",
    "in a time - dependent stochastic magnetic field with finite @xmath197 the configuration of the stochastic field @xmath311 changes , the magnetic lines move and consequently the perpendicular velocity of the particles is decorrelated leading to diffusive transport .",
    "we determine here the diffusion coefficient in such time - dependent fields in the limit of zero larmor radius , stating from the general solution ( [ lsf])-([dif ] ) .",
    "the effect of time variation of the stochastic magnetic field on the effective diffusion was previously studied in @xcite-@xcite but only for weak magnetic turbulence ( @xmath312 we determine the effect of stochastic island generation appearing in stochastic magnetic fields at @xmath313    the decorrelation trajectories obtained from eqs.([dectrx ] ) , ( [ dectr3 ] ) are in this case ( finite @xmath314 @xmath315 situated on closed paths ( except that for @xmath316 .",
    "a typical trajectory rotates on the corresponding path , then it stops and turns back .",
    "its velocity decays progressively and eventually the trajectory stops somewhere on its path .",
    "this is the modification determined by the time variation of the magnetic field : all decorrelation trajectories stop at a time of the order @xmath317 consequently , the running diffusion coefficient saturates . depending on the relation between the decorrelation time @xmath186 and the three characteristic times of this motion , @xmath318 @xmath319 @xmath320 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) several diffusion regimes are obtained .  in time - dependent magnetic fields , at @xmath321",
    "the time evolution of the diffusion coefficient is approximately the same with that obtained for @xmath322 and later , at @xmath323 @xmath0 saturates .",
    "thus , the asymptotic diffusion coefficient can be evaluated as @xmath324 using the running diffusion coefficient obtained in the static case .",
    "thus it can be approximating by the value of the running diffusion coefficient for the subdiffusive case at @xmath325  some results are presented in figure 4 where the asymptotic diffusion coefficient obtained from eq.([dint ] )  for finite @xmath186 is compared to the subdiffusive running diffusion coefficient represented in figure 2 .",
    "one can see that the approximation ( [ dtd ] ) is rather good for all values of @xmath326    the following diffusion regimes can be observed in figure 4 , in the nonlinear conditions when stochastic magnetic islands are generated ( @xmath327 or @xmath328 the quasilinear regime at small correlation times ( @xmath329 ) with @xmath330 is characterized by a fast time - variation which prevents trajectory trapping . at larger correlation times",
    "( @xmath331 the stochastic magnetic islands can be generated before the stochastic magnetic field changes and the parallel motion is ballistic . in these conditions",
    "the diffusion regime is similar to that described in @xcite for the electrostatic turbulence : the diffusion coefficient decreases with the increase of @xmath317 a minimum of the diffusion coefficient appears at @xmath332 followed by an anomalous increase determined by the interaction of the parallel trapping with the magnetic line trapping which generates correlation of the lagrangian velocities . at very large correlation times ( @xmath333 the diffusion coefficient decreases as @xmath334 we note that the regimes obtained for @xmath335 and for @xmath336 are similar with those reported in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "but instead of the plateau found there at intermediary @xmath337 we obtain here a more complicated behavior .",
    "this is the effect of stochastic magnetic island generation : it leads to the decrease of the effective diffusion coefficient with the increase of @xmath186 when the parallel motion is ballistic and , on the contrary , to the increase of @xmath304 with the increase of @xmath338 when the parallel motion is diffusive .",
    "we have studied here the transport of collisional particles in stochastic magnetic fields using the decorrelation trajectory method .",
    "we have derived analytical expressions for the running diffusion coefficient and for the lagrangian velocity correlation in terms of a set of deterministic trajectories .",
    "they are defined in subensembles of the realizations of the stochastic field as solution of differential ( hamiltonian ) equations that depend on the given eulerian correlation of the stochastic potential .",
    "they are approximations of the subensemble average trajectories and represent the dynamics of the decorrelation of the lagrangian velocity . since in general the equations for the decorrelation trajectories can not be solved analytically , a computer code was developed for determining the running diffusion coefficient for arbitrary values of the four parameters of this problem and for given eulerian correlation of the potential .",
    "we have shown that this rather complicated triple stochastic process is characterized by two kinds of trajectory trappings and contains two decorrelation mechanisms .",
    "the latter are produced by the collisional cross field diffusion @xmath185 and by the time variation of the stochastic magnetic field .",
    "one of the trapping processes concerns the parallel motion and is determined by collisions which constrain the particles to return in the already visited places with probability one .",
    "this parallel trapping leads to a subdiffusive transport in the absence of a decorrelation mechanism .",
    "this already known process is recovered by our method . the second kind of trapping concerns the magnetic lines which at @xmath266 wind around the extrema of the vector potential generating self - consistently magnetic islands .",
    "the effects of the magnetic line trapping in the presence of particle collisions is studied for the first time .",
    "we show that in the absence of a decorrelation mechanism , the stochastic magnetic islands determine a transitory decay of the running diffusion coefficient @xmath0 appearing at @xmath146 in the interval @xmath339 i.e. before the parallel trapping is effective .",
    "the simultaneous action of both trapping processes determine a nonlinear built up of lagrangian velocity correlation and eventually the parallel motion washes out the effect of the magnetic line trapping .",
    "consequently , the asymptotic behavior of the running diffusion coefficient is exactly the same as in the quasilinear conditions when the stochastic magnetic field does not generate magnetic islands .",
    "the effect of the two decorrelation mechanisms is afterwards studied .",
    "we show that the effective diffusion coefficient and its dependence on the parameters results from a competition between the trapping and the decorrelation processes and more precisely from the temporal ordering of the characteristic times of these processes .",
    "each one of the two decorrelation mechanisms leads to the already known diffusion laws when the stochastic magnetic islands are not present ( @xmath312 their presence ( at @xmath340 produces a complicated nonlinear interaction between the three stochastic processes which determines new scaling laws of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "they appear when the decorrelation time is longer than the flight time @xmath290 but smaller than the correlation built up time @xmath341 the first condition ensures the magnetic islands generation and the second prevents the elimination of their trapping effect by the parallel collisional motion .",
    "a particularly interesting regime is obtained for collisional decorrelation and consists of an effective diffusion coefficient that decreases when the collisional perpendicular diffusion increases ( fig .",
    "this rather complex dependence of the diffusion coefficients on the plasma parameters can be used in experiments for controlling the transport . even without changing the characteristics of the stochastic magnetic field",
