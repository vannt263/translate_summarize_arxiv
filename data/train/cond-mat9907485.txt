    "most of what we know experimentally about two - dimensional electron systems has been gleaned from the analysis of d.c .",
    "transport measurements .",
    "typically , a constant electric current is passed though a 2d system while the longitudinal and hall voltages are monitored as the temperature , magnetic field or density are varied .",
    "recently there has been a move toward the development of complementary techniques for acquiring information about the novel states of electronic matter that arise when these 2d systems are subject to strong magnetic fields .",
    "one such technique is phonon absorption spectroscopy@xcite .",
    "a pulse of non - equilibrium acoustic phonons is injected into the substrate of a semiconductor sample which has a 2d electron system formed at a heterojunction .",
    "the phonons travel ballistically across the substrate until they encounter the sheet of electrons where a small number of them are absorbed .",
    "acoustic phonons are particularly well suited to the study of 2d electron systems since they have energies and wave vectors that are well matched to the low energy collective excitations of these systems",
    ". measurements of the rate at which energy is absorbed by the electrons therefore contain important spectroscopic information about the states of the 2d electron system .",
    "the aim of this paper is to develop a framework for the interpretation of phonon absorption experiments carried out in the fractional quantum hall regime .",
    "these experiments are now at a sufficiently sophisticated stage that both time@xcite and , more recently , angle resolved measurements@xcite can be made .",
    "this paper will focus on our basic picture of what is happening in the experiments .",
    "the calculations presented will be entirely analytic , based on asymptotic analyses of general formulae making a wealth of simplifying approximations to expose the qualitative features to be expected . a more detailed numerical analysis which avoids some of the cruder approximations is currently in progress and",
    "will be published as a sequel to this work .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "an outline of the procedure employed in the phonon absorption experiments will be given . in section 3",
    "the pertinent features of electrons and phonons in semiconductor materials will be briefly reviewed while section 4 will review the standard picture of the fractional quantum hall state .",
    "we hope that this paper will be of interest to both the community which studies the fractional quantum hall effect and the community which studies phonons : sections 3 and 4 are intended to introduce the relevant ideas and to fix our notation .",
    "section 5 will discuss the phonon transport aspects of the experiments . in section 6",
    "the basic formulae for the rate of energy transfer from phonons to the electron liquid in the fractional quantum hall state will be introduced and the kinematics of the absorption discussed . in section 7 asymptotic expressions for the energy transfer rate will be derived employing an isotropic approximation for the phonon properties . in section 8 the time dependent aspects of the experiments are discussed . in section 9",
    "the processes leading to equilibrium within the 2des are discussed qualitatively ( a more quantitative discussion of some aspects of this matter will appear elsewhere ) .",
    "section 10 contains a summary of our picture of what happens in the phonon absorption experiments and what information could be extracted from them .",
    "various technical details of the calculations are relegated to appendices .    throughout this paper",
    "we will be discussing phonons characterized by three - dimensional wave - vectors and collective excitations of the electronic system characterized by two - dimensional wave vectors . in order to distinguish these we will use underlined characters , @xmath0 , to represent 3d vectors and bold characters , @xmath1 , to represent 2d vectors . where a 2d vector arises as the projection of a 3d vector onto the @xmath2-plane ( see inset to figure [ schematic ] ) this will be denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "an ideal phonon spectroscopy experiment would employ a monochromatic source of phonons on one side of a device and a tunable phonon detector on the opposite side with the 2d electron system lying between them .",
    "the fraction of phonons absorbed from each mode could then be measured . in practice",
    "there are no sources of monochromatic phonons which operate in high magnetic fields and , similarly , no spectrally sensitive phonon detectors .",
    "the best that one can hope to do at present is to inject a pulse of phonons with a distribution of modes and detect it on the far side of the 2des with a bolometer . in fact",
    ", even this has yet to be done .",
    "what is actually done at present involves the use of the 2des itself as a bolometer .    a schematic picture of the samples used in the experiment is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the basic device consists of a gaas / algaas heterojunction grown on top of a thick ( @xmath4 ) substrate of semi - insulating gaas .",
    "the active area of 2des is defined lithographically together with long connections to heavily doped ( 3d ) contacts .",
    "the active area is patterned into a long meander - line of 2des so that electrically it is a long , thin , hall bar with an aspect ratio of @xmath5 .",
    "this patterning increases the sensitivity of the device as a bolometer by increasing the longitudinal resistance . to compensate for this",
    ", exceptional care is taken to reduce the capacitance of the sample and the leads with respect to the ground so that the rc time constant of the measuring circuit is not too large @xcite .",
    "small area metallic films are evaporated onto the back face of the device and separate pairs of contacts made to each of these to allow them to act as heaters .",
    "the application of a current pulse to a heater leads to joule heating within the film .",
    "phonons are emitted from the film into the gaas with a black - body distribution of energies characterized by a pulse temperature , @xmath6 , which can be accurately predicted from the power dissipated in the film using acoustic mismatch theory@xcite .",
    "acoustic phonons in a semiconductor material such as gaas travel ballistically in the bulk of the material for frequencies up to @xmath7 ( this limit is set by the onset of rayleigh scattering from isotopic impurities ) which is much higher than the frequencies of interest here .",
    "the constant frequency surfaces in @xmath0-space are significantly non - spherical so that the phonon group and phase velocities are markedly different except along high symmetry directions .",
    "in fact the curvature of the constant frequency surfaces changes sign so that phonon wavepackets with a range of @xmath8-vectors tend to be focussed into preferred directions@xcite .",
    "another consequence of the elastic anisotropy of the semiconductors is that phonon modes are only strictly transverse or longitudinal along high symmetry directions .    throughout the experiment",
    "a constant current is passed through the 2d electron system and the two - terminal voltage monitored .",
    "the experiments are conducted at the centre of the quantum hall plateau at @xmath9 . at zero temperature",
    "the two terminal resistance would be identical to the quantized hall resistance @xmath10 , @xmath11 . at a finite temperature",
    "the resistance is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the finite temperature correction to quantized conductance tensor for a square 2des and @xmath14 is the number of squares in series in the device .",
    "one expects that at the plateau centre @xmath15 will be small and hence , given that @xmath16 , the change in the two - terminal resistance is dominated by @xmath17 .    before the application of the pulse to the heater",
    ", the voltage across the 2des is constant and has the value characteristic of the base temperature , @xmath18 , of the system . when the current is applied to the heater , a pulse of phonons",
    "is injected into the substrate which travels ballistically across until it hits the 2des , only when this occurs does the voltage change .",
    "the substrate is sufficiently thick that the component of the phonon pulse which contains the fast `` la '' modes spatiotemporally separates from the slower component containing the `` ta '' modes .",
    "some of the phonons from the pulse(s ) are absorbed by the electron sheet leading to a change in the 2-terminal resistance which is recorded . once the phonons have passed the 2des they hit the top face of the device where they undergo a variety of processes including mode conversion , diffuse scattering and reflection .",
    "the top face of the device is usually very close to the 2des so that this occurs virtually simultaneously with the encounter with the 2des .",
    "the reflected pulse travels back towards the rear face of the sample where it again undergoes a variety of scattering / reflection processes .",
    "what is left of the ballistic component of the pulse , having suffered two boundary reflections heads back towards the 2des . a clear response to the twice reflected phonons can be seen in the experiments .",
    "this is an experimental verification of the fact that the phonons of importance in these experiments really do propagate ballistically . at longer times the ballistic component",
    "is essentially gone and the time evolution of the 2 terminal voltage is simply due to the general heating of the lattice by the energy dissipated in the heater ; at very long times the temperature control of the refrigeration system extracts this energy , returning the system to its base temperature .",
    "the contacts that feed current to the 2des are deliberately placed far from it so that the phonon pulses do not hit the contacts until long after they have passed the 2des since the contacts will have a large response to the phonons .",
    "the electrons which accumulate at a gaas / algaas heterojunction at low temperatures form a two - dimensional electron system@xcite .",
    "each electron has the same wave function for motion in the direction perpendicular to the junction ( @xmath19-direction ) which we will denote by @xmath20 .",
    "the acoustic phonons in gaas are well described by the anisotropic debye approximation in which each phonon mode is labelled by a branch index @xmath21 ( roughly speaking @xmath22 `` la '' and @xmath23 `` ta '' modes ) and a 3d wave vector @xmath24 a given mode has frequency @xmath25 and polarization @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is a direction dependent speed of sound .",
    "in this paper we will neglect focussing effects and use the isotropic approximation that replaces @xmath29 by a constant .",
    "this oversimplification will be removed in subsequent numerical works .",
    "the main quantitative errors introduced by this approximation are expected to be in the relative magnitudes of the features associated with ta and la  phonons and their detailed dependance on phonon angle of incidence .",
    "there are two mechanisms by which electrons and phonons interact in gaas@xcite .",
    "deformation potential coupling arises because the presence of a long wavelength lattice distortion locally alters the band parameters , particularly the energy of the conduction band edge .",
    "this is described by a phenomenological expression for the potential energy experienced by an electron @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the deformation potential tensor and @xmath32 is the lattice strain tensor .",
    "another coupling mechanism arises from the fact that , in materials whose lattice structure does not possess a centre of symmetry , elastic distortions give rise to local charge rearrangements which are characterized by an electric polarization field @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the relative permittivity of the material and @xmath35 is the piezomodulus tensor .",
    "this polarization field also gives rise to a one - electron potential .",
    "in gaas the deformation potential tensor is actually a simple scalar @xmath36 with @xmath37 , while the piezomodulus tensor has the form @xmath38 with @xmath39 .    in second quantized form ,",
    "the combination of these mechanisms gives rise to an electron - phonon coupling hamiltonian of the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 creates a phonon in the given mode , @xmath42 is the fourier component of the ( 2d ) electron density , @xmath43 is the matrix element for phonon absorption / emission and @xmath44 is a form factor for the finite thickness of the 2des .",
    "details of the derivation of this form are presented in appendix [ couplings ] along with the detailed expressions for @xmath45 .",
    "the simplified forms for the electron phonon couplings that emerge from the isotropic debye approximation are discussed in appendix [ debye ] .",
    "the fractional quantum hall effect was the first experimentally observed manifestation of the incompressible quantum liquid state that occurs in 2d electron systems subject to a strong magnetic field , @xmath46 , such that the landau level filling factor @xmath47 ( @xmath48 is the area density of electrons and @xmath49 is the magnetic length ) is close to a low order , odd denominator fraction @xcite .",
    "laughlin@xcite proposed a trial wave function for the ground state of this liquid at filling factors of the form @xmath50 which clearly gave these fractions an especially low energy .",
    "laughlin also described the charged quasiparticle excitations above this ground state as fractionally charged objects that obey fractional statistics .",
    "these quasiparticles require a finite energy for their creation , even in the thermodynamic limit , which accounts for the incompressibility of the state .",
    "the energy gap for the creation of these objects , @xmath51 , determines the longitudinal conductivity of the system which has an activated temperature dependence , @xmath52 , in ideal systems . in real systems",
    "this form is not observed at the lowest temperatures because of the anderson localization of the quasiparticles .",
    "instead , conduction is supposed to occur via variable range hopping .",
    "girvin , macdonald and platzman@xcite ( gmp ) turned their attention to the possibility of low energy collective excitations of the laughlin liquid .",
    "they employed a modification of the technique used by feynman@xcite to describe the collective modes of superfluid helium-4 .",
    "they proposed neutral excited states characterized by a 2d wave vector @xmath1 of the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is laughlin s ground state and @xmath55 is a normalization factor .",
    "the operator @xmath56 is the fourier component of the electronic density , projected onto the lowest landau level ( see @xcite for details of this projection ) .",
    "the expectation value of the energy in this state was expressed exactly in terms of the lowest landau level projected static structure factor @xmath57 this quantity has an exact relation to the ordinary static structure factor which is known from monte - carlo hypernetted chain calculations on the laughlin wave function .",
    "the dispersion curve that arose from that analysis @xcite is presented schematically in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "this dispersion @xmath58  has a number of important features .",
    "the collective mode has a gap at all wave vectors ; unlike superfluid helium , there is no linearly dispersing , gapless phonon regime .",
    "this is a manifestation of the incompressibility of the state .",
    "the gap is a minimum , @xmath59 , at a finite wave vector , @xmath60 , which corresponds approximately to a wavelength equal to the average inter - particle spacing . by analogy with superfluid helium ,",
    "the excitations close to @xmath60 are referred to a magnetorotons .",
    "the supposition that the trial states @xmath61 are true eigenstates is equivalent to using the single mode approximation for the dynamic structure factor@xcite : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the cyclotron frequency which determines the landau level spacing .    at large @xmath64",
    "the collective mode is more properly thought of as an exciton composed of a pair of oppositely charged laughlin quasiparticles separated by a distance @xmath65@xcite .",
    "the energy of the exciton will be essentially the mutual coulomb energy of the charged constituents @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the energy needed to create an infinitely separated pair of quasiparticles , i.e. @xmath68    since , as we shall argue , the interaction between bulk acoustic phonons and the laughlin liquid is dominated by the creation of magnetorotons with wave vectors close to @xmath60 , we employ the standard roton form for the energy in the vicinity of the minimum@xcite @xmath69    from now on we will use units which are most natural for the system in question by taking @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the coulomb energy scale for the system which in s.i .",
    "units has the form @xmath72 the unit of velocity is then @xmath73 which is conveniently independent of magnetic field and density . in these reduced units",
    "the average speeds of sound are @xmath74 , @xmath75 while the magnetoroton minimum for @xmath76 is ( in the absence of any finite thickness , disorder and landau level mixing effects ) @xmath77 , @xmath78 . in a real system",
    "the expectation is that @xmath59 will be reduced by all these effects .",
    "we can treat the propagation of a phonon pulse across a device semiclassically .",
    "a formal solution of the phonon boltzman equation is not difficult but the absence of elastic scattering at the frequencies of interest renders even this level of sophistication unnecessary .",
    "we assume that the heater emits phonons isotropically in -space .",
    "this assumption is known to be incorrect in detail @xcite but will not lead to qualitative errors here .",
    "in fact the most obvious effect of the anisotropic emission is the suppression of phonon emission at large angles to the normal to the interface between heater and substrate , these phonons would `` miss ''",
    "the 2des system anyway ( in a more careful treatment they would miss by an even greater margin because of phonon focussing ) .",
    "the anisotropy in the emissivity for la phonons , @xmath79 , is generally weak .",
    "the anisotropy in the emissivity for the ta modes , @xmath80 and @xmath81 is stronger but the total ta emissivity , @xmath82 , is only weakly anisotropic so that , at least within the isotropic debye approximation used here , we do no real harm by neglecting it .    we describe the phonons in terms of wave packets whose spatial scale determines a normalization volume @xmath83 .",
    "when the phonons are created at the heater they are characterized by a distribution function @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the usual bose - einstein distribution function and the step function simply accounts for the fact that only phonons propagating into the sample are created ( the sample is mounted in a vacuum ) .",
    "the determination of which wave packets have reached the location of the 2des at time @xmath86 is a geometric problem . in principle",
    "the distribution of phonons in contact with the 2des is given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the thickness of the substrate , the group velocity associated with mode @xmath89 is @xmath90 @xmath91 is the duration of the pulse and @xmath92 and @xmath93 are characteristic functions for the 2des and the heater ( i.e. @xmath94 is unity if @xmath95 is within the area of the 2des and zero otherwise etc . ) .",
    "the two step functions ensure that the front of the pulse has reached the far side of the device but the back of the pulse has not , while the integral ensures that the group velocity points from somewhere on the heater to somewhere on the 2des ; the energy distribution is still that of a black body because no inelastic processes have occurred . in general @xmath96 is a complicated object to calculate because the group velocity is a non - trivial function of the wave vector . in the isotropic approximation used here",
    "we have @xmath97 so that @xmath98 which defines the characteristic function @xmath99 for the phonon pulse . in practice , what will matter for the purposes of this paper are the maximum and minimum angles of incidence @xmath100 for which @xmath101 is non - zero at any instant .",
    "let us now suppose that at some instant the phonons in contact with the 2des are characterized by a non - equilibrium distribution function @xmath102 as described above and that the 2des is in internal equilibrium at some temperature @xmath103 .",
    "in appendix [ transferrate ] it is shown that the rate at which energy is transferred from the phonon pulse to the incompressible liquid is given by the golden rule expression @xmath104 where @xmath43 is the electron - phonon matrix element discussed above and @xmath105 is the dynamic structure factor of the electron liquid . in appendix [ structure ]",
    "it is shown that in the regime @xmath106 , the leading asymptotics of @xmath107 can be obtained by using the zero temperature form for the structure factor for which we will use the single mode approximation @xcite .",
    "hence we find @xmath108 which has the straightforward interpretation that the processes involved are the direct conversion between phonons and magnetorotons with the matrix element @xmath109 .",
    "the two terms within the bracket involving the phonon occupation numbers represent phonon absorption and emission respectively .",
    "we are concentrating on the regime @xmath110 which ensures that @xmath111 for all modes that have sufficient energy to couple to the collective mode so that stimulated emission is always negligible .",
    "the phonon - magnetoroton conversion process is subject to the conservation of in - plane wave vector and energy , so that when a phonon with wave vector @xmath3 is absorbed , a magnetoroton of wave vector @xmath1 is created only when @xmath112 .",
    "it is often very useful to visualize such processes in terms of the crossing of dispersion curves .",
    "here there is the subtlety that the magnetoroton energy depends on the 2d wave vector @xmath64 while the phonon energy depends on the 3d wave vector @xmath0 .",
    "we can however create such a picture by concentrating on phonons with a given angle of incidence @xmath113 ( see the inset to figure [ schematic ] ) .",
    "for these phonons the energy depends on the in - plane component of the wave vector via @xmath114 in figure [ fig2 ] the dispersion relation for the magnetorotons ( in the ideal case for the case @xmath76 ) is plotted along with the dispersion curves for la  and ta  phonons incident at @xmath115 . in this case the la  phonon with the quoted angle of incidence and @xmath116 or @xmath117 couple to the electron liquid but no ta  phonons at this angle can .",
    "( the dispersion curves will eventually cross because the @xmath118 curve flattens out at larger @xmath119 but this crossing will happen at such large @xmath64 that the projected static structure factor , @xmath120 , which decays as @xmath121 for @xmath122 , will be negligibly small . ) the actual location of the crossing point , of course depends on the energy at the magnetoroton minimum . in real systems",
    "there are three effects which all act to reduce the size of the magnetoroton gap : finite thickness modifications to the effective inter - electron interaction ; landau level mixing and disorder @xcite .",
    "let us concentrate on the regime @xmath123 .",
    "in this case we can neglect stimulated phonon emission and replace the bose - einstein factor @xmath124 by the exponential @xmath125 for all phonons that can couple to the electron liquid .",
    "hence we obtain , converting the sum over wave vectors into an integral , @xmath126 at this point we will make a drastic simplification which will surely lead to quantitative error but will allow swift analytic progress and qualitative understanding : we will make the isotropic debye approximation and set @xmath127 .",
    "as can be seen in appendix [ debye ] this greatly simplifies the form of @xmath128 leading to @xmath129 @xmath130 where @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "the @xmath135 integral averages the electron phonon coupling over available in - plane directions , hence we define @xmath136 leaving us with the simplified expression @xmath137 which can be recast into the form ( see appendix [ integral ] ) @xmath138 where we have used the convenient shorthand notation @xmath139 carrying out the trivial @xmath140 integration then gives @xmath141 which is still a rather formidable integral .",
    "however we can make use of the fact that we are in the regime @xmath142 and use the method of steepest descents@xcite to establish the leading behaviour of the integral .",
    "naively , we would expect the integrals to be dominated by the minimum in the magnetoroton dispersion curve at @xmath60 but this is only true for the absorption integral provided @xmath143 ,  in other words that there are phonons in the pulse in contact with the electrons that can couple at the magnetoroton minimum .",
    "if we characterize the pulse by maximum and minimum angles of incidence @xmath144 and @xmath145 then we can distinguish three cases .    1 .   in the case",
    "that @xmath146 then there are phonons in the pulse that can couple to the magnetoroton minimum and the absorption integral will be dominated by the point @xmath60 : we refer to this as type i absorption .",
    "2 .   in the case that @xmath147 there are no phonons in the pulse that can couple to the magnetoroton minimum and the absorption integral is dominated by coupling to the collective mode with the lowest energy which can couple to phonons in the pulse , these have wave vector given by the lowest energy solution of @xmath148 this solution will always have @xmath149 : we refer to this as type ii absorption .",
    "3 .   in the case that @xmath150 there are simply no phonons in the pulse that can couple to the electronic system and there is no absorption ( type iii ) .    for the emission integral the same cases apply except that @xmath151 and @xmath152 ( so that case 3 does not arise ) .",
    "this of course ignores the possibility that for some directions @xmath153 the characteristic function @xmath154 for the pulse may be non - zero but the coupling to the electrons may vanish because of a zero in the @xmath155 or @xmath156 coefficients defined in appendix [ debye ] .",
    "we thus have two integrals to estimate @xmath157 and @xmath158 in the first case we expand around the minimum and find @xmath159 in the second case the integral is dominated by the upper end - point and we must expand around here @xmath160 where , because @xmath161 , we will have @xmath162 hence @xmath163    from the above analysis we can see that , at least in principal , phonon absorption experiments have the potential to reveal detailed spectroscopic information about the magnetoroton dispersion curve , at least in the vicinity of the minimum . by choosing the geometry of the experiment such that one is the situation where the phonon band delimited by @xmath164 and @xmath165",
    "does not include the magnetoroton minimum , the rate of energy transfer should be dominated by phonons with the maximum angle of incidence .    in order to illustrate these ideas",
    "let us consider the sample geometry shown in figure [ schematic ] and estimate the response to the angled heater h2 , taking the maximum and minimum angles of incidence to be @xmath166 and @xmath167 suppose that the magnetoroton gap is somewhat smaller than its ideal value , say @xmath168 .",
    "figure [ fig3a ] shows the extreme la lines on top of the magnetoroton dispersion curve while figure [ fig3b ] shows the extreme ta lines . from these",
    "we can see that there will be no ta absorption ( type iii ) while the la  absorption is ( just ) type ii with @xmath169 very close to @xmath170 .",
    "of course the details of which type of process dominates in a given geometry will depend on the actual phonon dispersion relations including the effects of anisotropy .",
    "let us now consider in more detail the experimental situation . in the experiments the quantity that is directly measured is the two - terminal resistance of the device as a function of time .",
    "we appeal to the wide separation between the timescales for the electron system ( @xmath171 ) and that of the experiment ( @xmath172 ) and the relatively weak coupling to the phonons to assert that on experimentally resolvable timescales the electronic system is always in local equilibrium at some well defined temperature @xmath173 .",
    "we suppose then , that the effect of the phonons is to heat up the electron gas and all that we observe is a consequence of the time variation of the electron temperature @xmath174 . the resistance of the sample as a function of temperature can be obtained in a straightforward transport experiment in which the equilibrium temperature of the whole device is varied while the current is kept constant . hence the results of the phonon experiments can be converted directly into a plot of @xmath175 .",
    "the time dependence of the electron temperature is given by @xmath176 where @xmath107 is the rate of energy transfer to the 2des and @xmath177 is the heat capacity of the electronic system at temperature @xmath178 .",
    "we will focus on the early time behaviour when @xmath179 and suppose that the geometry of the heater and active device are such that the absorption is type i. if we suppose that we have a uniform system in the @xmath9 ( @xmath180 odd ) state then we have @xmath181 for the electron gas itself",
    ". however the electron gas will be in thermal contact with metallic contacts with heat capacity @xmath182 so that we assume @xmath183 at early times the denominator will be dominated by the linear term so that we expect @xmath184    in a real high mobility device the 2des is subject to potential fluctuations which are slow on the scale of the magnetic length @xmath185 so that their effect can be described within the thomas fermi approximation @xcite .",
    "this predicts that , in the quantum hall regime with @xmath186 , the bulk of the sample will consist of a percolating ` lake ' of incompressible fluid . embedded within the lake will be isolated ` islands ' of compressible fluid ( perhaps themselves containing fully depleted regions ) . similarly at the boundary of the active area",
    "there will be strips of compressible fluid between the incompressible lake and the fully depleted region outside the device .",
    "let @xmath187 be the fraction of the area occupied by the electrons which is covered by the percolating incompressible liquid then we write @xmath188 where @xmath189 and @xmath190 are the energy transfer rate and the heat capacity of the incompressible fluid and @xmath191 and @xmath192 the corresponding quantities for the compressible regions . in the samples used in the experiments",
    "@xmath187 may not be so small because the active 2des is patterned into a meander line to increase its overall resistance and hence its sensitivity as a bolometer . in the previous sections",
    "we have developed a theory for @xmath189 .",
    "its counterpart in the compressible regions@xcite will have the form @xmath193 where the power @xmath14 depends on the dominant coupling process and on the nature of the correlations in the compressible state .",
    "the heat capacity of the compressible regions will also be metallic with @xmath194 hence we have that @xmath195 t_{e}}% \\qquad .\\ ] ] thus we see that the presence of compressible regions can greatly complicate the interpretation of results .",
    "all of the above is based on the supposition that there is a wide separation between the timescale for experimental measurements of the resistance and the internal ( energy ) relaxation time for the 2des .",
    "normally one supposes that electronic relaxation times are of the order of @xmath196 while the instrumental resolution of current phonon experiments is of the order of a nanosecond . our confidence in the belief that the electronic systems is always in local equilibrium at temperature @xmath173 is based on recent systematic experiments which show that the results obtained in the phonon absorption experiments do not have any significant dependence on the duration of the phonon pulse @xmath91@xcite .",
    "we will , however , at least consider the equilibration processes involved .",
    "equilibration within the compressible regions will be dominated by quasiparticle scattering and therefore rapid except at the very lowest temperatures .",
    "equilibration within the incompressible regions is more problematic .",
    "one could imagine a process whereby the creation of magnetorotons by the absorption of phonons from the high energy tail of the bose distribution leads directly to the formation of unbound charged quasiparticles .",
    "this process would involve a magnetoroton being scattered into a higher energy state by the absorption of a low energy phonon from the bulk of the bose distribution and that this gives rise to a steady `` heating '' of a magnetoroton until its size exceeds some screening length at which point it dissociates into a pair of oppositely charged quasiparticles .",
    "a simple estimate@xcite for the rate of this kind of process was made which simply assumed a magnetoroton `` density of states '' with the result that the growth in the number of quasiparticles was sub - linear ( @xmath197 ) . a more careful analysis of this process including phase space restrictions on magnetoroton - phonon scattering@xcite",
    ", however , shows that this process will not heat the magnetorotons to sizes in excess of @xmath198 and hence will not lead to any free quasiparticles .",
    "this process could of course still dominate in `` dirty '' situations in which conservation of magnetoroton momentum is not necessary due to the effects of short range correlated disorder .",
    "the dominant mechanism for equilibration is therefore likely to involve collisions between magnetorotons .",
    "this rate should be proportional to @xmath199 and so could become rather slow at low electron temperatures .",
    "equilibration between the percolating sea of laughlin liquid and the compressible regions ( including the contacts ) is presumably by conversion processes in which a ballistically propagating magnetoroton encounters a compressible region and is converted into a particle - hole excitation .",
    "in this paper we have developed a basic framework for the interpretation of phonon absorption experiments in the fractional quantum hall regime .",
    "our basic picture is the following .",
    "phonons with a black - body distribution of energies are injected into the gaas substrate of a device containing a 2des at a gaas / algaas heterojunction .",
    "the phonons propagate ballistically with spatiotemporal separation of the `` la '' and `` ta '' phonons . those phonons that have the appropriate group velocities eventually come into contact with the 2des .",
    "the transfer of energy from the part of the phonon pulse that meets the electron gas is controlled by the process in which phonons are destroyed and magnetorotons created .",
    "the energy that is transferred to the electronic system via this bottleneck rapidly equilibrates , with metallic contacts ( and possibly islands of compressible fluid ) acting as thermal reservoirs , leaving the electronic system at a raised temperature with a consequent increase in the two - terminal resistance .",
    "we predict that the rate at which the electronic system absorbs energy from the phonon pulse will have a dependence on the heater temperature of the form @xmath200 where @xmath59 is the gap at the magnetoroton minimum , provided there are phonons in the pulse that can couple at the minimum ( type i absorption ) .",
    "if this is not the case then the energy absorption rate will be dominated by the lowest energy magnetorotons to which the phonons can couple and will have the form @xmath201 where @xmath169 is the lowest energy solution of equation [ dominant ] .",
    "hence , by judiciously positioning heaters on the bottom face of a device so that a range of angles can be sampled , it should be possible to map the dispersion relation @xmath202 for @xmath203 at appropriate discrete @xmath64 values .",
    "it has also been argued that the presence of compressible regions within the active area of the 2des will introduce additional phonon absorption with a power law dependence on the heater temperature .",
    "all of the detailed calculations in the preceding sections have been carried out in the asymptotic regime @xmath142 and have made isotropic approximations for the propagation of the phonons .",
    "numerical calculations are in progress to rectify these deficiencies and these will appear as a subsequent publication another shortcoming of the present work is that we have based everything on the single - mode approximation of girvin , macdonald and platzman which is only reliable for fractional states with filling factors @xmath76 , @xmath204 etc .",
    "work is in progress to investigate the use of other frameworks for the collective modes of fractional quantum hall systems based on composite fermion ideas@xcite .",

    "we shall not do this here , partly because there is no coupling to small @xmath8 phonons because of the presence of a gap , but mostly on the grounds that we are directly employing an approximation ( and a very good one in the regime of interest ) for the dynamic structure factor which includes all screening effects . in practice of course the incompressible nature of the fractional quantum hall state",
    "means that potentials such as this are hardly screened at all .",

    "in the isotropic debye approximation we neglect the anisotropy in the speeds of sound and set @xmath250 , where @xmath251 and @xmath252 . the phonon polarizations become strictly transverse and longitudinal .",
