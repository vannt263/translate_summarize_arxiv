    "in 1961 matinyan and tsilosani @xcite indicated that there might exist a new kind of mechanism that would contribute to the energy loss during a particular stage of stellar evolution .",
    "gell - mann @xcite showed that the process wherein two @xmath18 quanta are converted into neutrino - antineutrino pair @xmath19 , is forbidden under current current coupling theory .",
    "he argued that a local weak interaction , to the lowest order of @xmath3 ( fermi coupling constant ) , would lead to a vanishing amplitude for the above process .",
    "if one of the photon is replaced by a coulomb field the process would be no longer forbidden and termed as photo - coulomb neutrino process @xmath20 .",
    "matinyan and tsilosani @xcite calculated the scattering cross - section and neutrino luminosity for this process in the non - relativistic approximations .",
    "this calculation indicated that at the density @xmath21 @xmath22 and temperature @xmath23 k the energy loss rate via this process would be @xmath24 @xmath25 , which is much greater than the energy loss rate due to the photon emissions at the same temperature and density .",
    "they pointed out that the rate of energy release obtained by the photo - coulomb neutrino process would be many times smaller than that in hydrogen reactions , and therefore the neutrino loss can compete with the thermonuclear loss provided the thermonuclear reactions in the star are non - existent and the star is characterized by a large value of @xmath4 ( nucleus ) . they compared their result ( neutrino luminosity ) with that of the neutrino bremsstrahlung process obtained by gandelman and pinaev @xcite .",
    "their investigation showed that in a wide range of stellar density and temperatures this mechanism might be dominant over the neutrino bremsstrahlung . in 1962",
    "rosenberg @xcite considered this process in detail according to the current current coupling theory , assuming the existence of a direct electron - neutrino weak interaction .",
    "chiu and morrison @xcite suggested in their paper that the direct electron - neutrino interaction implied by the current current coupling theory would give rise to the processes that might increase the neutrino luminosity of stars , thereby affecting stellar evolution .",
    "the matrix element of the photo - coulomb neutrino mechanism contains a diverging term arising out of the presence of electronic loop in the feynman diagrams .",
    "rosenberg imposed the gauge invariant condition explicitly to obtain a finite result which , he indicated , would be analogous to the situation in standard quantum electrodynamics leading to ward s identity .",
    "neutrino was considered massless in his calculations . according to his considerations only electron type of neutrino - antineutrino pair",
    "would be emitted in this process .",
    "this had rationale as the process was studied in the direct electron - neutrino weak interaction theory .",
    "rosenberg calculated the scattering cross - section and the energy loss rate for the low photon energy .",
    "he argued that for @xmath26 k the photo - coulomb neutrino would give smaller contribution in comparison to pair annihilation or photo - neutrino process . in 1969",
    "raychaudhuri @xcite considered this process assuming that the photons could interact weakly with the neutrinos .",
    "he calculated the scattering cross - section and energy loss rate in the framework of this photon neutrino weak coupling theory .",
    "he also computed the neutrino luminosity expressed in the unit of solar luminosity and compared the result with that obtained in the current current coupling theory .",
    "it was observed from the comparison that at the density @xmath21 @xmath22 and in the temperature range @xmath27 k , the photo - coulomb neutrino calculated in the current current coupling theory would be dominating over that in the photon neutrino weak coupling theory .",
    "this showed that current current coupling theory could explain this process successfully and thus strongly supported rosenberg s work on photo - coulomb neutrino process .",
    "+ the above works motivated us to study this process in the framework of electro - weak theory .",
    "it is known that in the low energy region the electro - weak theory conforms to the current current coupling theory and since the photo - coulomb neutrino process was successfully explained by current current coupling theory , it should give , at least in principle , the same result when calculating in the electro - weak theory . according to the electro - weak theory the neutrino pair emission always takes place through the exchange of intermediate vector boson and the interaction lagrangian contains neutral current as well as charged current .",
    "therefore , we consider the diagram exhibiting @xmath28 effect , which has a significant contribution in calculating the scattering cross - section .",
    "in addition to that , all three types of neutrino are involved in this process , which contribute a greater cross - section compared to what was calculated by rosenberg @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that there is no scope to consider muon and tau neutrinos under the local electron - neutrino interaction theory .",
    "we also like to consider the process in a more generalized manner and hence the virtual electronic loop is replaced by a fermionic loop consisting of all first generation fermions , i.e. , electrons along with @xmath29 and @xmath30 quarks .",
    "the consideration is quite reasonable as it includes all possible fermions in the theory .",
    "all possible feynman diagrams are taken into account , though many of them would have almost negligible effect in the matrix element .",
    "we are going to calculate the total scattering cross - section and to obtain an analytical expression for the energy loss rate depending on absolute temperature .",
    "we also like to compute the neutrino luminosity and the process is studied in the temperature range @xmath31 k , which characterizes a low energy region . the calculation is also carried out when the energy of the incoming photon is quite high compared to the rest energy of the electron ( but still very much smaller than that of intermediate boson ) .",
    "though this case is not much relevant in the astrophysical scenario , we should give more emphasis on the process wherein low energy photon is involved . an important point to be noted that is unlike rosenberg s consideration @xcite we consider the neutrino mass . the nucleus involved in this process",
    "is taken to be at rest . in principle",
    ", it may not be at rest , but because of the heavy rest mass its motion is ignored .",
    "the situation is quite similar to the process like coulomb scattering in quantum electrodynamics .",
    "the calculations related to the photo - coulomb neutrino process are shown here in more detail .      in the photo - coulomb neutrino process",
    "a real photon interacts with a space - like photon coming out of a heavy nucleus , which is assumed to be at rest .",
    "all feynman diagrams pertaining to this process are shown in figures-1 , 2 and 3 , though the diagrams in figure-3 would have negligible contribution as each of those contains more than one intermediate bosons . according to electro - weak theory the photon can not directly interact with neutrino ; therefore , the diagram has a loop .",
    "this loop gives unwanted divergent term in the matrix element .",
    "taking figure-1 and figure-2 the matrix element can be constructed as follows : @xmath32\\eqno{(1.2.1)}\\ ] ] where , @xmath33 d^{4}q\\eqno{(1.2.2)}\\ ] ] @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 is the color factor and @xmath38 is the fermionic charge taken in the unit of @xmath39 ; @xmath40 stands for all first generation quarks and electron . in the equation ( 1.2.1 )",

    "+ the expression @xmath43 is symmetric under the interchange of the labels 1 and 2 .",
    "an important part of this calculation is to evaluate the integral @xmath44 ; or in other words , to remove the divergent term arising in it .",
    "rosenberg @xcite imposed the gauge invariant condition explicitly to solve this problem .",
    "we have used almost the same procedure and it is shown in detail in the appendix at the end of this chapter . after removing the divergent factor we can obtain the following expression .",
    "@xmath45 where , @xmath46 we can use the equation ( 1.2.5 ) to get the expression for @xmath47 .",
    "our aim is to calculate the scattering cross - section for this process .",
    "the scattering cross - section for the photo - coulomb neutrino process is calculated by using the following formula .",
    "@xmath48 here , the summation is taken over the spin states of the neutrino and antineutrino .",

    "the energy loss rate is calculated to see how much energy can be radiated from the stellar core per unit mass per unit time as the result of photo - coulomb neutrino process .",

    "+ we are now going to calculate the neutrino luminosity expressed in the unit of solar luminosity in the non - degenerate stellar core .",
    "it is calculated from the following formula @xcite @xmath77 where , @xmath78 and @xmath79}\\ ] ] we see that @xmath80 plays an important role to find the neutrino luminosity . in the stellar body",
    "the pressure @xmath81 is composed of two parts : radiation pressure @xmath82 and gas pressure @xmath83 .",
    "the fraction of the gas pressure is denoted by @xmath80 , i.e. , @xmath84 in the case of perfect gas , the gas pressure is given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the mean molecular weight . in the non - degenerate gas we can not neglect radiation pressure and it becomes @xmath87 where @xmath88 represents steafan - boltzman constant . + finally , the neutrino luminosity for the photo - coulomb neutrino process is obtained as @xmath89 + in the similar manner the neutrino luminosity can be obtained from rosenberg s result . in the table-1",
    "we compare these two results in the temperature range @xmath31 k and it shows that the result obtained in electro - weak theory dominates that obtained in current current coupling theory .",
    "the table also shows that both the results seem to be significant near the temperature @xmath90 k.      photo - coulomb neutrino process is studied anticipating that it may play an important role in a particular stage during stellar evolution .",
    "this process is very much similar to the neutrino bremsstrahlung process . in the bremsstrahlung the neutrino pair emission takes place when an electron collides with a heavy nucleus , whereas in the photo - coulomb neutrino process the photon interacts with nucleus to emit neutrino - antineutrino pair .",
    "it has already been mentioned that earlier this process was calculated and explained by rosenberg .",
    "however , he did not design a general structure of this kind of interaction in the framework of electro - weak theory . to realize a complete picture",
    "we have intended to consider this process according to the standard model . in the framework of electro - weak theory",
    "we have calculated the scattering cross - section which is larger than that obtained by rosenberg .",
    "the scattering cross - section is obtained in the low energy limit , that is , when the energy of the incoming photon is much lower than the rest energy of the electron .",
    "this situation can be realized in terms of astrophysical observable quantities @xmath91 the temperature and density .",
    "the energy being much lower than the rest energy of electron signifies that the stellar temperature ( core temperature ) is well below @xmath92 k and density is less than or equal to @xmath93 @xmath22 .",
    "for that reason we have computed the neutrino luminosity in the temperature range @xmath31 k and at the density @xmath93 @xmath22 .",
    "it has also been found from table-1 that the relative luminosity obtained in the electro - weak theory is greater than that obtained in the current current coupling theory .",
    "if we study this table carefully , we see that at the beginning of the table the relative luminosity is very small , but as we move towards the end of the table , i.e. , towards the temperature @xmath90 k , the relative luminosity increases rapidly and the process exhibits the significant effect . in this temperature range",
    "the neutrino luminosity is comparable to the photon luminosity , which clearly indicates that the photo - coulomb neutrino process is important in the temperature range indicated in the table-1 .",
    "+ let us now consider the case when the energy of the photon is much greater than @xmath94 ( rest energy of any kind of first generation fundamental fermion ) , but well below the rest energy of the intermediate bosons .",
    "astrophysically this is not an interesting case .",
    "the neutrino luminosity for the photo - coulomb neutrino process is negligibly small in this energy range .",
    "therefore , the process has no significant role in high temperature and density .",
    "in particular the process has the maximum effect at the temperature close to @xmath90 k and density @xmath93 @xmath22 .",
    "thus the photo - coulomb neutrino process plays a crucial role for energy loss in the star having low luminosity .",
    "the term @xmath95 related to the fermionic loop can be expressed as @xmath96@xmath97 where , @xmath98 @xmath99 = -a_{5}(k_{1},k_{2})\\eqno{(2)}\\ ] ] @xmath100 [ instead of @xmath101 we present here @xmath102 . ] + the terms @xmath103 and @xmath104 are represented by the divergent integrals , which create a difficulty .",
    "to get rid of this difficulty the following conditions ( gauge invariancy ) are imposed .",

    "@xmath110 where , @xmath111 inserting the expressions of @xmath103 and @xmath104 into the equation ( 1 ) along with using the identity ( 8) and the conditions @xmath112 it can be obtained @xmath113@xmath114\\mid k_{1}k_{2}\\varepsilon_{1}\\varepsilon_{2}\\mid\\eqno{(11)}\\ ] ] the above expression can be simplified by expressing @xmath115 and @xmath116 in terms of @xmath117 and @xmath118 respectively from the conditions given by ( 2 ) .",
    "again , it is known that @xmath119 represents the four momentum of the external photon and thus the following condition holds . @xmath120",
    "let us choose the frame of reference such that @xmath121 in this frame it is found that @xmath122 therefore , finally the equation ( 11 ) is written as @xmath123 this gives the equation ( 1.2.5 ) .",
    "in this chapter we are going to study the electron - neutrino bremsstrahlung process in which two electrons interact with each other to produce neutrino antineutrino pair and thus in the final state there are four fermionic particles ( two electrons and a pair of neutrino antineutrino ) . here",
    "the interaction takes place between two identical electrons . through this interaction the neutrino antineutrino pair is produced . in quantum electrodynamics there is a similar kind of process , where photon is emitted instead of neutrino antineutrino pair and whose scattering cross - section was obtained by wheeler and lamb @xcite , and the calculations were also carried out by i. hodes @xcite and e. huang @xcite .",
    "previously , the electron - neutrino bremsstrahlung process was considered by cazzola and saggion @xcite .",
    "they calculated the energy loss rate in the non - degenerate stellar region and discussed the implications of this process .",
    "they took all possible diagrams to carry out the calculations numerically by using monte carlo method , although they did not obtain the scattering cross - section explicitly .",
    "they considered only the non - degenerate case , though many important stellar objects in the later phases such as white dwarves , neutron stars etc .",
    "are degenerate in nature ; therefore , the possibility of occurring the electron - neutrino bremsstrahlung in degenerate stars can not be ruled out .",
    "although they did not carry out the calculations in the degenerate region , but they pointed the process might be significant in the degenerate region as well . by the work of cazzola and saggion",
    "@xcite we are motivated to calculate the process in the framework of electro - weak theory . in our work",
    "we consider both non - degenerate and degenerate cases separately and discuss all possible outcomes of the electron - neutrino bremsstrahlung process .",
    "we also visualize a picture of the stellar regions in which the process will have some significant effect .",
    "it can not be denied that due to some approximations a little bit deviation may occur from the original result , but that will not deter to realize the physical picture .",
    "the role of this process is studied thoroughly at different temperature and density ranges during the late stages of the stellar evolution .      in the electron - neutrino bremsstrahlung process",
    "a slight complication arises since the identical particles ( electrons ) are involved .",
    "it is not possible to identify which of the two outgoing particles is the ` target ' particle for a particular ` incident ' electron . in classical physics",
    "such identification can be done by tracing out the trajectories . in quantum physics",
    "the two alternatives are completely indistinguishable ; therefore , the two cases may interfere .",
    "there exist 8 possible feynman diagrams shown in figure-4 and figure-5 .",
    "the total scattering amplitude for all possible diagrams can be constructed as follows : @xmath124\\eqno{(2.2.1)}\\ ] ] @xmath125\\]]@xmath126 [ \\overline{u}_{\\nu}(q_{1})(1-\\gamma_{5})\\gamma^{\\rho}v_{\\nu}(q_{2})]\\eqno{(2.2.2)}\\ ] ] @xmath127\\]]@xmath128 [ \\overline{u}_{\\nu}(q_{1})(1-\\gamma_{5})\\gamma^{\\rho}v_{\\nu}(q_{2})]\\eqno{(2.2.3)}\\ ] ] @xmath129 @xmath130@xmath131 where , @xmath132 the superscript @xmath4 associated with the matrix element and each of its component indicates that the neutrino antineutrino pair emission takes place through the exchange of @xmath4 boson .",

    "let us consider @xmath152 \\frac{d^{3}q_{1}}{2q_{1}^{0}}\\frac{d^{3}q_{2}}{2q_{2}^{0 } } \\delta^{4}(q - q_{1}-q_{2})\\ ] ] @xmath153 it is to be remembered that the neutrino mass is very small compared to the magnitude of its linear momentum .",
    "this is valid throughout our calculations , even in the non - relativistic case .",
    "even if it is comparably nearer to the magnitude of the linear momentum , no such neutrino - antineutrino pair will be emitted and the process will become superfluous . this is very much consistent with the standard model which is based on the concept of massless neutrino .",
    "thus taking @xmath154 we evaluate the integral @xmath155 and find the value of @xmath156 and @xmath157 as follows : @xmath158 we also have , @xmath159 in the same manner the term @xmath160 is evaluated to obtain an expression similar to that given by the set of equations ( 2.2.7 ) to ( 2.2.11a ) ; in that case @xmath81 is replaced by @xmath161 , where @xmath162 evaluating the various trace terms rigorously and simplifying those expressions we obtain @xmath163 the right hand side of this equation is a scalar obtained by the various combinations of the scalar product of initial and final momenta of the electrons .",
    "thus @xmath164 becomes the function of either energies or momenta of incoming and outgoing electrons .",

    "for that reason @xmath167 @xmath168 is twice the mass of the corresponding fermion .",
    "the square root term present in the denominator of the equation ( 2.2.15 ) comes from the incoming flux which is directly proportional to the relative velocity of the incoming electrons and written in the lorentz invariant way .",

    "this factor arises since for @xmath171 identical final particles there are exactly @xmath173 possibilities of arranging those particles , but only one such arrangement is measured experimentally .",
    "we calculate the expression of @xmath174 in the equation ( 2.2.15 ) and then integrating that expression the scattering cross - section is obtained .",

    "table-4 indicates that in the temperature range @xmath370 k the nsr luminosity is very high in the neutron star .",
    "thus this process may play a significant role in the cooling of highly magnetized neutron star .",
    "therefore , we can say the neutrino synchrotron process is important during the later phase of the stellar evolution , especially in the degenerate , extreme - relativistic and highly magnetized stellar objects .",
    "in 1959 it was pointed out by pontecorvo @xcite that neutrino - antineutrino pair could be emitted when electron collides with a heavy nucleus .",
    "he calculated the rate of the probabilities for the emission of photon as well as neutrino pair by the bremsstrahlung radiation and concluded that at certain stages of stellar evolution it might be possible that the energies sent into space in the form of photons and neutrinos would be comparable , in spite of very low rate .",
    "he noted further that due to strong temperature dependence of the probability of the process of neutrino bremsstrahlung radiation and also with the increase of the nuclei @xmath4 , resulting into the decrease of photon mean free path , the importance of the neutrino bremsstrahlung process would be greater for energy balance .",
    "all these would lead to the supposition that the neutrino bremsstrahlung process could be important in certain stages of stellar evolution at which the temperature and average @xmath4 ( nuclei ) considerably exceed the corresponding values for the sum . in 1960",
    "gandelman and pinaev @xcite investigated this process for non - relativistic non - degenerate electron gas in the context of the intended astrophysical application .",
    "they showed that in a certain range of high density and high temperature the energy loss by bremsstrahlung emission of neutrino pairs would become greater than the loss due to radiative thermal conductivity .",
    "they calculated the scattering cross - section and then neutrino luminosity , and the comparison was done with respect to the photon luminosity .",
    "such comparison indicated that the neutrino luminosity could produce an appreciable effect only in the stars with high density .",
    "they speculated that the bremsstrahlung process would lead to even greater energy loss than that by urca process .",
    "though they did not investigate the regime of the degenerate equation of state , but from quantitative considerations they concluded that the neutrino effect might play an important role in higher density than that in the non - degenerate regime . in 1969 festa and ruderman @xcite extended the earlier calculations of neutrino bremsstrahlung to the relativistic and degenerate region considering the screening of the coulomb field , important at high density , and also assuming some lattice effects . in the limit of infinite density @xmath22 ; in the neutron star it may go to @xmath239 @xmath22 . ] where the electrons are very much relativistic , their calculations indicated , the energy loss rate would depend on the temperature .",
    "it was then pointed out that the neutrino bremsstrahlung process must have maximum effect at the high density and moderate temperature . in 1971",
    "saha @xcite studied this process in the framework of photon neutrino weak coupling theory and compared his result with that obtained in the current current coupling theory .",
    "he finally concluded that the process would be important only in the cases of highly dense stars having the temperature below @xmath284 k. cazzola et al .",
    "@xcite carried out the detailed calculations of neutrino bremsstrahlung numerically to cover the full range of electron degeneracy , and it supported the work of festa and ruderman @xcite . in 1973 flowers @xcite studied the process extensively using a many - body approach and got the similar results . in 1976",
    "dicus et al .",
    "@xcite reconsidered the process for the relativistic degenerate electron gas in the framework of electro - weak theory including the neutral current .",
    "they carried out the calculations related to this process considering weak as well as strong screening effect , which would not change the energy loss rate by more than a factor of 2 .",
    "their result revealed that in the standard model the energy loss rate would become 1.3 times the rate in v - a theory .",
    "+ the works of most of the researchers indicate that the process has got maximum effect when the electron gas is highly degenerate and relativistic .",
    "even though gandelman and pinaev @xcite calculated the process in the non - degenerate non - relativistic region , still they comprehended the process would become important in the degenerate case .",
    "the calculation of this process undergone by festa and ruderman @xcite , and then by dicus et al .",
    "@xcite is important in the relativistic degenerate regime when the density is very high .",
    "it is known that the region in which the neutrino bremsstrahlung process is supposed to have the maximum effect , may be highly magnetized in a few cases .",
    "we are going to study the neutrino bremsstrahlung process in presence of a magnetic field .",
    "we are strongly motivated by the supposition that the bremsstrahlung process may be influenced by the high magnetic field , present in some neutron stars and magnetars . in the previous chapter",
    "we have discussed that a strong magnetic field causes neutrino - antineutrino emission through neutrino synchrotron radiation , while in the present case the magnetic field affects the bremsstrahlung process externally .",
    "we consider the neutrino bremsstrahlung process in presence as well as in absence of a magnetic field as two independent processes , and intend to calculate the scattering cross - section and energy loss rate for both of them .",
    "a comparative study can also be carried out to see how a magnetic field influences the rate of neutrino - antineutrino emission .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the screening effect is taken into account for the process in absence of a magnetic field ; but in presence of a magnetic field such screening effect is no longer effective .",
    "the neutrino bremsstrahlung process occurs when an electron collides with a nucleus to emit neutrino - antineutrino pair .",
    "if there exists a strong magnetic field it will affect the momentum of the electron and so will influences the bremsstrahlung process . in that case",
    "the motion of the electron is dissimilar compared to the situation when there is no magnetic field and thus the basic structures for these two processes will be different . figure-11 and figure-12 represent the feynman diagrams for neutrino bremsstrahlung in presence of a magnetic field . in our calculations",
    "the presence of a magnetic field plays a crucial role and as such it is to be handled with care . without violating the generality",
    "we can choose @xmath288-axis along the direction of magnetic field .",
    "the component of electron momentum along the direction of magnetic field remains unaffected .",
    "it is clear that the effect of the magnetic field on the electron quantizes its energy to the direction perpendicular to @xmath287 and thus transverse components get replaced by @xmath371 , whereas the longitudinal component @xmath291 is directed along the magnetic field .",
    "the feynman diagrams for the neutrino bremsstrahlung process are almost similar for both in presence and in absence of a magnetic field ; only we have to keep in mind that four momenta of the electronic lines in the diagrams , are to be modified when a magnetic field is present . in presence of a magnetic field the energy momentum relation of the electron",
    "is modified to @xmath372 where @xmath0 g stands for the critical magnetic field and @xmath303 represents the landau level for the electron in the magnetic field .",
    "it is to be mentioned that the twice averaged value of the fermion spin projection @xmath373 is related to the landau level @xmath303 by the following relation .",
    "@xmath374 where @xmath375 .",
    "clearly , @xmath376 if the electron spin is along the magnetic field direction , and @xmath377 if it is opposite to the magnetic field direction . for the ground landau level the value of @xmath373 is taken as 1 .",
    "+ let us consider and calculate the bremsstrahlung process in absence of a magnetic field .",
    "in this case the coulomb field has the potential as follows .",
    "@xmath378 i.e. , a single charge with an exponential screening cloud ( yukawa like charge distribution ) , where @xmath379 is the debye screening length given by @xmath380 @xmath381 and @xmath355 represent the fermi momentum and energy , respectively .",
    "we consider the potential , given by ( 4.2.2 ) , because the screening effect is important in the high density region .",

    "it is sufficient to calculate the expression @xmath394 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath395 to be noted that in the equation ( 4.2.10 ) there is no term of the neutrino momentum , so this part is not considered when we integrate over the final momenta of neutrinos .",
    "let us now evaluate the squared spin sum of the expression @xmath396 and then integrating over final momenta of the neutrinos we obtain [ appendix - a ] @xmath397 @xmath398 up to this step the calculations for the neutrino bremsstrahlung process is identical in both situations @xmath91 in presence as well as in absence of a magnetic field .",
    "it is assumed that in presence of a magnetic field the quantized transverse components of the momentum do not participate directly during the interaction between nucleus and electron .",
    "only the @xmath288-component of the electron momentum takes part in this process .",
    "thus in this case we obtain an expression almost similar to the equation ( 4.2.11 ) replacing @xmath399 and @xmath400 by @xmath401 and @xmath291 respectively .",
    "now , to integrate the squared sum of the matrix element over all final momenta we shall utilize the result obtained in the equation ( 4.2.10 ) and ( 4.2.11 ) .",
    "we are to remember that there is no screening effect in presence of a strong magnetic field . in presence of a magnetic field",
    "the phase space factor takes the form [ appendix - b ] @xmath402 whereas in the ordinary neutrino bremsstrahlung process the integration over the final momentum of electron is done in the usual manner . in the extreme - relativistic limit",
    "we evaluate the integral over the final momentum of electron and obtain the following expression .",
    "@xmath403 @xmath404 this expression is obtained for the neutrino bremsstrahlung process in absence of a magnetic field . in presence of a magnetic field this expression",
    "becomes @xmath405 the term @xmath406 arises in the equation ( 4.2.13 ) due to the weak screening effect .",
    "it is given by @xmath407 the terms @xmath212 and @xmath213 for the electron type of neutrino emission differ from those in case of muon and tau neutrino emissions , since @xmath5-boson exchange diagrams are present only when the electron neutrino - antineutrino pair is emitted .",
    "now , inserting the above two expressions [ from the equations ( 4.2.13 ) and ( 4.2.14 ) ] into the expression of the scattering cross - section for both the cases and switching over to the c.g.s .",
    "unit we finally obtain @xmath408 in absence of a magnetic field , whereas @xmath409 in presence of a magnetic field .",
    "+ to be noted that in our calculations we have considered all the three types of neutrino as earlier cases .",
    "our result ( equation 4.2.16 ) shows that the scattering cross - section for the neutrino bremsstrahlung process in presence of a magnetic field depends not on the energy of the incoming electron , but on the intensity of a magnetic field present .      in the extreme - relativistic case the energy loss rate in erg per nucleus per second for the neutrino bremsstrahlung process",
    "is calculated by the formula @xmath410}c\\sigma e e^{\\frac{e - e_{f}}{\\kappa t}}\\eqno{(4.3.1)}\\ ] ] where @xmath355 stands for the fermi energy of the electron .",
    "we are considering the situation where the electrons are highly degenerate .",
    "we know that in the degenerate region the energy of the electron remains below the fermi energy level . to obtain the energy loss rate in erg per gram per second ,",
    "@xmath411 is divided by @xmath412 which comes to @xmath413 where , @xmath414 + the @xmath241 represents the ratio of the fermi temperature to the maximum temperature of the degenerate electron gas .",
    "the degeneracy is attained only when the following condition is satisfied @xcite .",
    "@xmath415 we have calculated @xmath416 , considering the fact that the temperature and density of the electron gas present in the core of a newly born neutron star would be approximately @xmath417 k and @xmath239 @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the term @xmath406 , arising due to the weak screening in absence of a magnetic field , is related to @xmath241 by @xmath418 .",
    "thus we can calculate the term @xmath406 .",
    "finally , the expression for the energy loss rate in absence of a magnetic field is obtained as @xmath419 in the same manner we obtain the energy loss rate in presence of a magnetic field . in that case the phase space factor is replaced according to the rule defined in ( 4.2.12 ) .",
    "thus we calculate the energy loss rate in presence of a magnetic field as @xmath420 where , @xmath421 + we have computed ( table-5 ) the logarithmic value of the energy loss rate in the temperature range @xmath422 k and the magnetic field @xmath423 g at a fixed density @xmath365 @xmath22 .",
    "the neutrino bremsstrahlung process is an important mechanism for ascertaining the energy loss in the stellar core during the stellar evolution .",
    "this process may be very effective in the highly degenerate region , for example , the core of the low mass red giant , white dwarf etc .",
    "along with this degenerate nature if the electron gas is highly relativistic , the energy loss rate through the bremsstrahlung process becomes significantly high .",
    "therefore , it may be a significant source of energy loss through neutrino - antineutrino emission during neutron star cooling which characterizes a highly relativistic degenerate region .",
    "it was calculated that the neutrino luminosity in the crust of a neutron star is high enough , but it is to be verified what will be the effect of neutrino emission by the bremsstrahlung process in the core region , particularly when the core is strongly magnetized",
    ". we know in the neutron stars and magnetars the magnetic field may reach to @xmath424 g and may influence the neutrino bremsstrahlung process .",
    "we are , here , verifying how a magnetic field affects the bremsstrahlung process @xmath91 whether it increases the rate of energy loss or decreases it . in the neutrino synchrotron radiation ,",
    "neutrino - antineutrino pair emission takes place since the electron changes its landau levels , but in the bremsstrahlung the landau levels are assumed to remain unchanged throughout the process .",
    "the neutrino bremsstrahlung process occurs through the change of magnitude of the longitudinal component of the electron linear momentum directed along the magnetic field . +",
    "our calculations show that the presence of a strong magnetic field weakens the neutrino bremsstrahlung process in the early stage of neutron star cooling resulting the decrease of energy loss rate , whereas in some stages it ( the strong magnetic field ) facilitates the process .",
    "this is clear if we study the table-5 where the energy loss rate is computed in the logarithmic scale .",
    "it is observed from this table that in the temperature range @xmath238 k @xmath425 k and at the density @xmath239 @xmath22 the energy loss rate for the neutrino bremsstrahlung process in absence of a magnetic field is greater than that in presence of a strong magnetic field ( @xmath426 g ) .",
    "we interpret that in the early stage of neutron star cooling , when the temperature remains above @xmath238 k , the effect of the neutrino bremsstrahlung process gets lowered due to the presence of a strong magnetic field , although the energy loss rate is still very high .",
    "if the strength of the magnetic field goes well below the critical value , the process becomes free from the influence of this magnetic field , and a greater amount of energy is lost .",
    "if we look at the table more carefully then it appears that there exists a particular region ( @xmath92 k @xmath427 k , @xmath428 g and @xmath429 @xmath22 ) k @xmath430 k. ] during a neutron star cooling where the neutrino bremsstrahlung process contributes a greater amount of energy loss by the influence of a magnetic field compared to the situation when there is no magnetic field at all .",
    "this is an important consequence of our study that in a particular region the magnetic field makes the neutrino bremsstrahlung process more rapid , but in general the process becomes less effective in presence of a magnetic field .",
    "therefore , it is ascertained that if the temperature falls below @xmath238 k , the process gives maximum effect due to the presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "we emphasize the point that the process is accelerated by a magnetic field when its intensity reaches @xmath424 g , i.e. , it is possible only in case of neutron stars and magnetars having a very high magnetic field .",
    "our study reveals that the neutrino bremsstrahlung process has an important contribution to the energy loss in the highly degenerate stellar core during the late stages of stellar evolution in presence of a strong magnetic field .",

    "the decay of plasmons @xmath464 , termed as plasma neutrino process , into neutrino - antineutrino pair is considered to be very effective mechanism to bring out energy from the stellar core , particularly in the degenerate region . in the plasma the vibrations of both electromagnetic waves and the charged particles generate transverse as well as longitudinal waves .",
    "when the dielectric constant of the electron gas becomes less than unity the photon behaves as if it has a rest mass that is equal to the plasma frequency .",
    "if the plasma frequency ( @xmath465 ) is not negligible relative to the temperature ( @xmath466 ) of the stellar core , the collective behavior of the plasmon is more significant than the effect from a single photon and electron . in 1963",
    "adams et al .",
    "@xcite considered the plasma decay process to carry out the calculations in astrophysical scenario .",
    "they calculated the energy loss rate for the decay of both transverse and longitudinal plasma in the low as well as high temperature limit .",
    "they also indicated that the neutrino luminosity of a star could far exceed its photon luminosity at a central temperature higher than @xmath252 k , and also at the higher density where it would have dominant effect compared to the pair annihilation process resulting in neutrino pair emission . in 1972",
    "dicus @xcite considered various neutrino emission processes in the electro - weak theory . in that paper",
    "he outlined the plasma neutrino process and briefly discussed its importance . in 1990",
    "braaten @xcite modified the dispersion relation used in the earlier calculations .",
    "in the high temperature limit , the use of the new ultra - relativistic dispersion relation would increase the emissivity by a factor of 3.185 . in 1991",

    "their result indicated that the longitudinal emissivity would be suppressed relative to the transverse emissivity by a factor of @xmath467 in the high - temperature limit .",

    "it was found that the effect would be negligible in the regions of astrophysical interest since the cyclotron frequency @xmath469 is very small in comparison with the plasma frequency @xmath470 . in the subsequent paper @xcite they studied the decay of longitudinal plasmon in presence of the strong magnetic field .",
    "contrary to the transverse case , the decay of longitudinal plasmons would have a significant contribution in presence of a magnetic field . in 1998",
    "kennett and melrose @xcite carried out detailed calculations of such anisotropic plasma decay into @xmath471 pair .",
    "they calculated the response tensor in presence of a strong magnetic field for cold as well as thermal plasma .",

    "are already known to be important processes occurring in the stellar core .",
    "it is found that the combination of such neutrino emission processes is the main source of energy loss during the later phases of the evolution of stars . in the following section we have discussed different regions which are relevant during the stellar evolution .",
    "in the later stages of the stellar evolution the stellar objects can be classified into four major regions depending upon the density and temperature of the electron gas present in their cores .",
    "it is obvious that the temperature of the stellar core during the later stages of the evolution of stars is nearer to or even more than @xmath252 k. in some cases like white dwarf cores the temperature may be around @xmath284 k. in the highly relativistic and degenerate stellar objects , such as neutron stars , the core temperature may be higher than @xmath280 k. we have considered such regions in our study since the neutrino emissions depend on the temperature and density ( and sometime on magnetic field ) .",
    "we have got an impression from the study of different neutrino emission processes that all mechanisms may not be effective throughout the entire stages of stellar evolution , rather in a specific region a particular process may have a significant effect .",
    "let us first brief the four main regions @xcite .    1 .",
    "* non - relativistic non - degenerate region : * this region is characterized by the temperature @xmath477 k and @xmath478 .",
    "the important stellar objects in this region are massive stars beyond helium burning stage , nuclei of the planetary nebula and possibly quasars",
    "* non - relativistic degenerate region : * this region is confined within the range @xmath479 k , @xmath480 @xmath22 and @xmath481 . along with the massive stars beyond helium burning stage other stellar objects in this region are white dwarf , pre - white dwarf stars and population - ii red giant .",
    "* relativistic non - degenerate region : * this region is observed in the stellar bodies when the electron gas , present within them , becomes relativistic in nature .",
    "the physical conditions required to attain this region are @xmath482 k and @xmath483 .",
    "pre - supernova stars belong to this region .",
    "the stellar collapse too is an example of the relativistic non - degenerate region .",
    "* relativistic degenerate region : * this is an important region related to the end stage of the stellar evolution and most of the neutrino emission processes we have studied in this paper , are relevant in this region .",
    "this region is characterized by the physical conditions @xmath482 k and @xmath484 .",
    "the main stellar object in this region is the neutron star , especially in its newly born stage .",
    "the magnetar is another stellar object in the relativistic degenerate region .    besides these four regions",
    "there is another factor which plays an important role in some neutrino emission processes @xmath91 the presence of strong magnetic field .",
    "although we know very little about the magnetic field inside the stars , it is possible that some of the degenerate stars may have very large internal magnetic field .",
    "a number of stars on or near the main sequence , particularly a - type stars , have been observed to have surface magnetic field of the order of @xmath485 g , which suggests that there are fields of the same order of magnitude in the interior of these stars .",
    "it has already been indicated in chapter 3 that in some white dwarves , which are the end stages of low mass stars , the magnetic field may reach up to @xmath280 g. it has also been mentioned that the neutron star , which is extremely relativistic and highly degenerate , may have a strong magnetic field . in some neutron stars the magnetic field ,",
    "if present , may be very high ( @xmath486 g ) .",
    "the neutron star having a very high magnetic field is called a magnetar @xcite .",
    "when in a supernova a star collapses to a neutron star , its magnetic field increases drastically in strength .",
    "it is estimated that about 1 in 10 supernova explosions results in a magnetar instead of a standard neutron star or pulsar . in the following sections we discuss the effect of neutrino emission processes in different regions in both absence and presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "most of the stellar objects during their evolution period are non - magnetic . in the later stages of the stellar evolution , when there is no magnetic field , the photo - neutrino , pair annihilation , plasma neutrino and neutrino bremsstrahlung are considered to have significant contributions to carry away the energy through the emission of neutrinos .",
    "the details are in the book written by chiu @xcite and later the most updated considerations of the above processes are discussed in the book written by raffelt @xcite . it is found that in the comparatively low temperature and density range the photo - neutrino process is much effective and dominating over all other processes .",
    "thus the photo - neutrino is the dominating process in the non - relativistic non - degenerate region .",
    "the scenario changes with the increasing temperature in the same density range characterizing the relativistic non - degenerate region . in this region",
    "the pair annihilation process becomes the main source of energy loss . in the degenerate region",
    "the plasma neutrino process plays a dominant role over other neutrino emission processes .",
    "it is to be noted that although the neutrino bremsstrahlung has a significant contribution in the relativistic degenerate region , the plasma neutrino process has the greater effect .",
    "a diagram is provided in chiu s book @xcite to show in which region which process has the dominant role .",
    "it clearly indicates the region of importance of different processes during the later stages of the stellar evolution .",
    "this diagram was drawn from the results obtained from current current coupling theory .",
    "the diagram is also consistent with the result obtained by dicus @xcite , although he calculated the process according to the electro - weak theory . in this paper",
    "we have studied two important non - magnetic processes .",
    "we would like to study in which region those processes have important effect .",
    "it is to be pointed out that dicus @xcite considered two types of neutrino in his calculations , whereas we consider all three types .",
    "we include tau neutrino in our calculations .",
    "we have calculated all processes ( non - magnetic and magnetic ) strictly following the standard model ; only a minor relaxation is allowed when we consider a small neutrino mass in our calculations .",
    "+ at first , we have considered the photo - coulomb neutrino process and found this process to have some effect in the non - degenerate region , especially at the temperature close to @xmath90 k. in the non - relativistic and non - degenerate region the most dominating process is the photo - neutrino process , but with the high temperature and low density ( relativistic non - degenerate region ) pair annihilation process is more dominating .",
    "the photo - coulomb neutrino process at the temperature @xmath90 k in this region with its maximum possible effect has the lesser contribution compared to the above two processes .",
    "thus the photo - coulomb neutrino process is not the dominant mechanism in any particular region , though its role can not be ignored .",
    "a point is to be noted that the analytical expression of energy loss rate for the photo - coulomb neutrino process has a strong temperature dependence @xmath487 ; therefore , the energy loss rate increases rapidly with the increasing temperature .",
    "thus in a very short range of temperature this process has a significant contribution .",
    "below the temperature @xmath488 k this process practically has insignificant contribution , but around @xmath90 k it suddenly becomes significant . +",
    "another important process ( non - magnetic ) we have studied , is the electron - neutrino bremsstrahlung .",
    "we have calculated this process in the framework of the electro - weak theory in the different regions of the stellar evolution in late stages . in the non - relativistic non - degenerate region",
    "the electron - neutrino bremsstrahlung has a little effect . in the range of temperature @xmath31",
    "k and density @xmath489 @xmath22 the contribution of this process can not be more than that of photo - neutrino process .",
    "the electron - neutrino bremsstrahlung process has significant contribution in the extreme - relativistic region . in the extreme - relativistic non - degenerate region",
    "the dominating neutrino emission process is pair annihilation .",
    "its effect is so dominating that the contribution of the electron - neutrino bremsstrahlung remains suppressed , though the energy loss rate of the later process is also very high in the relativistic non - degenerate region .",
    "in the same manner , though the electron - neutrino bremsstrahlung contributes a high energy loss rate in the extreme - relativistic degenerate region , the plasma neutrino process has a greater contribution in this region .",
    "therefore , the electron - neutrino bremsstrahlung process can not be dominating in any particular region , although its effect must be taken into account when we consider the neutrino emission processes from stellar core . in figure-13",
    "we have presented the region of dominance of different neutrino emission processes in absence of magnetic field .",
    "of course , the photo - coulomb neutrino and electron - neutrino bremsstrahlung have not been shown in the figure as none of these is dominant in any particular region , but the contributions of both of these processes are to be taken into account while calculating the total energy loss rate by all neutrino emission processes during the later stages of stellar evolution .",
    "the presence of a high magnetic field may influence the neutrino emission rate during the evolution of stars .",
    "we have considered two important processes which are relevant in presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "this kind of high magnetic field , close to or greater than the critical magnetic field , is observed when the stellar core is highly degenerate and relativistic in nature .",
    "it is important to note that we have not calculated the plasma neutrino process in presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "in fact , in absence of a magnetic field the decay of plasma is dominating in the region indicated here ( highly degenerate and extremely relativistic ) . also in presence of a strong magnetic field the plasma neutrino process may have a significant contribution in this region .",
    "however , in our study we are not considering this effect . here",
    ", we consider only the processes which have been studied in this paper @xmath91 neutrino synchrotron radiation and neutrino bremsstrahlung .",
    "the neutrino synchrotron process is a widely discussed topic and found to have enormous effect in the cooling of magnetized neutron stars .",
    "in addition to this we have considered the effect of a strong magnetic field on the neutrino bremsstrahlung process .",
    "we have found that this magnetic neutrino bremsstrahlung process has also some remarkable effects during the cooling of magnetar like stellar objects , particularly , in their newly born stages .",
    "we have carried out a comparative study between these two important magnetic processes at @xmath490 g in the density range @xmath491 @xmath22 to find out the regions of dominance .",
    "it comes out from our study that both the processes have significant effects in the extreme - relativistic degenerate region in presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "consequently , the neutrino bremsstrahlung process is dominating at a comparatively low temperature , although in the region under consideration ( extreme - relativistic and highly degenerate ) the temperature is much greater than @xmath492 k. in the figure-14 the region of importance of these two processes are indicated at the magnetic field @xmath490 g. such a picture in presence of the strong magnetic field is the result of our detailed study .",
    "of course , the regions of dominance change if we consider the comparison at different magnetic field which may vary from @xmath486 g in the magnetized neutron stars or magnetars .",
    "our study confirms that the above two processes are necessarily to be considered for the energy loss in the star where the magnetic field is very high .",
    "we have carried out a study concerning the role of some neutrino emission processes as the stellar energy loss mechanisms .",
    "all those processes may not be effective simultaneously , rather in a specific region a particular process may have a remarkable effect . in this paper",
    "we have calculated four neutrino emission processes @xmath91 two in presence of strong magnetic field . in the preceding sections we have discussed the role of different neutrino emission processes in different regions during stellar evolution .",
    "it has been pointed out that although the electron - neutrino bremsstrahlung and photo - coulomb neutrino are not dominating neutrino emission processes in any stage of stellar evolution , but they may play significant role in some stages . besides that",
    ", the other two processes , we have studied in presence of a strong magnetic field , are important when the stellar objects are extremely magnetized ( @xmath486 g ) . finally , we have indicated the region of dominance of different neutrino emission processes both in absence and in presence of a magnetic field , which gives an idea about the significance of different neutrino emission processes in the different stellar regions during the late stages of evolution of stars .",

    "<S> .1 in    * introduction : * + the life span of a star is governed mostly by the mode of energy loss in it . in the later phases of stellar evolution </S>",
    "<S> the life time of stars depends mainly due to the emission of neutrinos via a number of processes . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the neutrino emission processes , that are so important in the later stages , is suppressed by the electromagnetic emission in the early stages of stellar evolution . in the stellar objects , for examples , white dwarves , neutron stars etc . </S>",
    "<S> neutrinos correspond to a sink of energy coming out during their cooling period . </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino emission occurs when the core of stars collapses in the high temperature and density . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the neutrino emission processes draw attention of the scientists and researchers because of their significant role to carry away the energy from the stellar core , particularly in the later phases . in 1940 </S>",
    "<S> gamow and schoenberg @xcite speculated that the neutrino emission might be significant during the collapse of evolved stars . </S>",
    "<S> they calculated the energy losses through the neutrinos produced in the reactions between free electrons and oxygen nuclei and suggested that such energy losses could cause a complete collapse of the star within a time period of half an hour . </S>",
    "<S> they named such interaction as urca process . at a very high temperature and density , which exist in the interior of the contracting stars during the late stages , </S>",
    "<S> the urca process may cause the emission of large number of neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> these neutrinos penetrating almost without difficulty the body of the star , must carry away quite a large amount of energy and prevent the central temperature from rising above a certain limit , which would result in a _ catastrophic _ collapse . </S>",
    "<S> pontecorvo @xcite predicted that the neutrino - antineutrino pair might be formed as a result of bremsstrahlung process , i.e. , when the electron would collide with a heavy nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> he first emphasized that the existence of a direct weak interaction between low - energy neutrinos and electrons would have interesting and profound implications for stellar evolution . </S>",
    "<S> later , this bremsstrahlung process was developed in the non - relativistic as well as relativistic situations . </S>",
    "<S> chiu and his collaborators @xcite considered a number of neutrino emission processes to carry out the calculations in order to obtain the neutrino luminosity of hot stars . </S>",
    "<S> their works included some neutrino emission processes and indicated the importance of those processes during stellar evolution . </S>",
    "<S> after that many attempts were made to study other neutrino emission processes in the context of stellar evolution . in 1961 matinyan and tsilosani @xcite investigated a new kind of mechanism in which neutrino - antineutrino pair would be emitted by the interaction of the photon with nucleus . in 1967 </S>",
    "<S> landstreet @xcite studied neutrino emission by the synchrotron process . </S>",
    "<S> that is very much analogous to the electromagnetic synchrotron radiation . against this backdrop </S>",
    "<S> the need was felt for a detailed study of all neutrino emission processes and the importance of their role in stellar evolution . </S>",
    "<S> + it is known that the stellar matter ( even under some extreme conditions as in white dwarves or in neutron stars ) is almost transparent to the neutrinos , in contrast to its behavior with respect to photons . the neutrino emission is quite dissimilar to the other mechanisms of energy transport from the core of the star . </S>",
    "<S> the other mechanisms , such as electromagnetic radiations , require the transport of internal energy to the surface to get radiated and as a result the rate of energy loss is related to the temperature gradient of the star . </S>",
    "<S> it has been observed that when stellar core contracts considerably the neutrino emission increases and the neutrinos , created in the stellar core , directly come out of the star . </S>",
    "<S> this happens owing to its large mean free path ; since the cross - section of the interaction of neutrino with charged particles is very low @xmath1 @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the weakness of the neutrino coupling with matter leads to a situation where the very weakly emitted neutrino bears more significance than emitted photons . in the higher density </S>",
    "<S> the mean free path of the neutrinos much exceeds typical stellar radii . as the neutrinos </S>",
    "<S> emerge directly from the point of origin , the energy outflow does not depend upon the temperature gradient , but is given directly by the rate at which these are produced . in the astrophysical perspective </S>",
    "<S> it is very important to study those neutrino emission processes as the energy loss mechanisms from stellar objects in the later stages . </S>",
    "<S> there is a number of neutrino emission processes which are supposed to play a very important role in this regard . </S>",
    "<S> earlier all those processes were studied mostly in the framework of the current current coupling theory . in 1958 </S>",
    "<S> feynman and gell - mann @xcite as well as sudarshan and marshak @xcite proposed the universal v - a interaction theory , according to which the weak interactions would be , in fact , a mixture of vector and axial vector interactions . </S>",
    "<S> this theory could explain the electron - neutrino elastic scattering characterized by the strength of the fermi coupling constant @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the noticeable property of the neutrino is the weakness of its interactions with other particles . </S>",
    "<S> these spectacular neutrino interactions are characterized by the fermi coupling constant that measures the size of the matrix element for the various processes . </S>",
    "<S> the development of this beautiful v - a theory helped the scientists and researchers to explain those processes in the low energy region . </S>",
    "<S> but v - a theory failed to explain the high energy phenomena and the neutral current in weak interaction . introducing this neutral current a more generalized theory </S>",
    "<S> called electro - weak theory was developed by salam @xcite , glashow @xcite and weinberg @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this theory succeeded to unify electromagnetic and weak interactions and became an important ingredient of the standard model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> according to this elegant theory the neutrino pair emission takes place through the exchange of neutral @xmath4-boson or charged @xmath5-boson depending upon the charge conservation . in 1972 dicus @xcite calculated a number of neutrino emission processes in the framework of this electro - weak theory and obtained the analytical expression for energy loss rate in different regions to study their role in the astrophysical scenario . </S>",
    "<S> his work clearly indicates the importance of those neutrino emission processes to carry away the energy from the stars . </S>",
    "<S> it may be mentioned that another theory which was advanced by bandyopadhyay and raychaudhuri is photon neutrino weak coupling theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> some processes , such as , neutrino synchrotron process @xcite , plasma neutrino process @xcite etc . give some important astrophysical findings ( specially in the cooling of white dwarves and neutron stars etc . ) in the framework of this photon neutrino weak coupling theory as the cross - section is much smaller in the high energy region than that obtained in the electro - weak theory . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , this photon neutrino weak coupling theory has not been verified in the laboratory . </S>",
    "<S> + in the earlier works the neutrino emissions were believed to be governed by three important processes which are given as follows : @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8 there exist a few more , such as , neutrino bremsstrahlung process ( @xmath9 ) , photon - photon scattering ( @xmath10 @xcite ; @xmath11 @xcite ) etc . </S>",
    "<S> that may also have some significant effects under certain circumstances . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider the following four important neutrino emission processes . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 @xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 @xmath15 it merits careful attention that the ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) of the above processes are considered in presence of a strong magnetic field since the stellar core may be magnetized in some cases . the presence of magnetic field may influence some neutrino emission processes . in the subsequent chapters we have considered all four processes and carried out a detailed calculations in the framework of the electro - weak theory with a minimal extension of the standard model as the presence of small neutrino mass has been assumed . in the standard model neutrino </S>",
    "<S> was considered a massless particle , but some phenomenological consequences viz . </S>",
    "<S> ` solar neutrino problem ' and ` atmospheric neutrino anomaly ' @xcite led to the concept of tiny neutrino mass . </S>",
    "<S> in some works @xcite related to the photon - neutrino interaction process ( @xmath16 ) this small neutrino mass was already taken into account . in our calculations we have put the neutrino mass by hand and since it is very small the basic assumptions of the standard model are not violated . </S>",
    "<S> we have also considered all three types of neutrino @xmath17 in our entire calculations . with all such considerations we have calculated exhaustively the four neutrino emission processes . in the first two chapters the neutrino emission processes in absence of magnetic field have been considered , whereas in the next two we have studied the processes in presence of strong magnetic fields . in our entire paper </S>",
