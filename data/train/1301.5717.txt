    "@xcite has proved remarkably successful at discovering rotation - powered pulsars emitting photons above 0.1  gev .",
    "thanks to its superb sensitivity , the number of gamma - ray pulsars has increased from six in compton gamma ray observatory era @xcite to more than one hundred @xcite . plotting their best estimate of the gamma - ray luminosity , @xmath0 , against the spin - down luminosity , @xmath1 , @xcite found the important relation that @xmath0 is approximately proportional to @xmath2 ( with a large scatter ) , where @xmath3 refers to the neutron - star ( ns ) moment of inertia , @xmath4 the ns rotational period , and @xmath5 its temporal derivative .",
    "however , it is unclear why this relationship arises , in spite of its potential importance to discriminate pulsar emission models such as the polar - cap model @xcite , the outer - gap model @xcite , the pair - starved polar - cap model @xcite ( see also @xcite for the possible co - existence of such models ) , and the emission model from the wind zone @xcite .",
    "recent gamma - ray observations suggest that the pulsed gamma - rays are emitted from the higher altitudes of a pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "this is because the observed light curves @xcite favor fan - like emission geometry , which scan over a large fraction of the celestial sphere , and because the crab pulsar shows pulsed photons near and above 100  gev @xcite , which rules out an emission from the lower altitudes , where strong magnetic absorption takes place for @xmath6-rays above @xmath7  gev .",
    "consequently , higher - altitude emission models such as the outer - gap model @xcite , the high - altitude slot - gap model @xcite , or the pair - starved polar - cap model @xcite , gathered attention .",
    "it is noteworthy that the outer - gap model is presently the only higher - altitude emission model that is solvable from the basic equations self - consistently @xcite . in the present paper , therefore , we focus on the outer - gap model and derive the observed relationship @xmath8 both analytically and numerically .",
    "we schematically depict the pulsar outer - magnetospheric accelerator ( i.e. , the outer gap ) in figure  [ fig : sideview ] .",
    "as the ns rotates , there appears the light cylinder , within which plasmas can co - rotate with the magnetosphere .",
    "the magnetic field lines that become tangential to the light cylinder at the light cylinder radius , @xmath9 , are called the last - open magnetic field lines , where @xmath10 refers to the speed of light .",
    "pairs are produced via photon - photon pair production mostly near the null - charge surface and quickly polarized by the magnetic - field - aligned electric field , @xmath11 , in the gap . in this paper , we assume that the rotation and magnetic axes reside in the same hemisphere to obtain @xmath12 , which accelerates positrons ( @xmath13 s ) outwards while electrons ( @xmath14 s ) inwards .",
    "these ultra - relativistic particles have lorentz factors , @xmath15 , to emit photons efficiently by the curvature process .",
    "in this section , we analytically derive how the gamma - ray luminosity of an outer gap evolves with time . in the outer magnetosphere ,",
    "only the dipole component remains in the magnetic field ; thus , the inhomogeneous part of the maxwell equation ( i.e. , the poisson equation for the electro - static potential ) gives the magnetic - field - aligned electric field @xcite , @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the ns magnetic dipole moment , and @xmath18 the trans - magnetic - field thickness of the gap .",
    "since the poisson equation is a second - order differential equation , @xmath11 is proportional to @xmath19 .",
    "electrons ( @xmath14 s ) and positrons ( @xmath13 s ) are created via photon - photon ( and sometimes via magnetic ) pair production , being subsequently polarized by @xmath11 and accelerated in the opposite directions , to finally attain the terminal lorentz factor @xmath20 where @xmath21 refers to the radius of curvature of particle s motion in the three - dimensional magnetosphere , @xmath22 the charge on the positron .",
    "photons are radiated by such ultra - relativistic @xmath23 s via curvature process with characteristic energy , @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the planck constant , @xmath26 . once @xmath18 is obtained",
    ", we can readily compute the @xmath6-ray luminosity of curvature radiation from an outer gap by @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 , which has been conventionally assumed to be approximately unity , refers to the flux correction factor @xcite , and @xmath29 the rotation angular frequency of the ns . here",
    ", it is assumed that the current density flowing in the gap is comparable to the goldreich - julain value @xcite .",
    "the last factor , @xmath30 is proportional to the spin - down luminosity , @xmath31 . therefore , the evolution law , @xmath32 , is crucially governed by the evolution of @xmath18 as a function of the ns age , @xmath33 .    the evolution of @xmath18 is essentially controlled by the photon - photon pair production in the pulsar magnetosphere . to analytically examine the pair production , we assume the static dipole magnetic field configuration for simplicity , and consider the plane on which both the rotational and magnetic axes reside ( fig .  [ fig : sideview ] ) . on this two - dimensional latitudinal plane",
    ", the last - open field line intersects the ns surface at magnetic co - latitudinal angle @xmath34 ( measured from the magnetic dipole axis ) that satisfies @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the ns radius , @xmath37 the angle ( measured from the rotation axis ) of the point where the last - open field line becomes tangential to the light cylinder , and @xmath38 the inclination angle of the dipole magnetic axis with respect to the rotation axis",
    ". a magnetic field line can be specified by the magnetic co - latitude ( measured from the dipole axis ) , @xmath39 , where it intersects the stellar surface .",
    "a magnetic field line does not close within the light cylinder ( i.e. , open to large distances ) if @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the last - open field lines , @xmath41 , corresponds to the _ lower _ boundary , which forms a surface in a three - dimensional magnetosphere , of the outer gap .",
    "let us assume that the gap _ upper _ boundary coincides with the magnetic field lines that are specified by @xmath42 .",
    "numerical examinations show that @xmath18 , indeed , changes as a function of the distance along the field line and the magnetic azimuthal angle ( measured counter - clockwise around the dipole axis ) .",
    "nevertheless , except for young pulsars like the crab pulsar , an assumption of a spatially constant @xmath18 gives a relatively good estimate .",
    "thus , for an analytical purpose , we adopt a constant @xmath18 in this analytical examination . in this case",
    ", we can specify the middle - latitude field line by the magnetic co - latitude @xmath43 .",
    "screening of @xmath11 due to the polarization of the produced pairs , takes place mostly in the lower altitudes .",
    "it is , therefore , appropriate to evaluate the screening of @xmath11 around the point ( @xmath44,@xmath45 ) where the null - charge surface intersects the middle - latitude field line ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sideview ] ) .",
    "an inwardly migrating electron ( or an outwardly migrating positron ) emits photons inwards ( or outwards ) , which propagate the typical distance @xmath46 ( or @xmath47 ) before escaping from the gap . denoting the cross section of the inward ( or outward ) horizontal line from the point ( @xmath44,@xmath45 ) and the upper boundary as ( @xmath48,@xmath49 ) ( or as ( @xmath50,@xmath51 ) ) , and noting @xmath52",

    "( [ eq : s_l2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where @xmath44 depends on @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath65 , we can expand the left - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : s_th1 ] ) around @xmath66 , where @xmath63 for inward ( or @xmath64 for outward ) @xmath6-rays to find @xmath67 .",
    "that is , the leading terms in the expansion vanish and we obtain @xmath68 from the next - order terms , which are quadratic to @xmath69 . assuming @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is appropriate for @xmath72 years for a light - element - envelope ns and for @xmath73 years for a heavy - element ns , we find @xmath74 , and hence @xmath75 .",
    "since the dipole radiation formula gives @xmath76 , we obtain @xmath77 .",
    "thus , when the gap is very thin , which is expected for a light - element - envelope ns , @xmath0 little evolves with the pulsar age , @xmath33 .",
    "however , if @xmath78 , say , the rapidly expanding magnetic flux tube gives asymmetric solution , @xmath79 .",
    "that is , the third and higher order terms in the expansion contribute significantly compared to the quadratic terms .",
    "thus , we must solve equation  ( [ eq : s_th1 ] ) for @xmath60 ( @xmath80 or @xmath51 ) without assuming @xmath81 , in general .",
    "let us now consider the condition for a gap to be self - sustained . a single ingoing @xmath14 or an outgoing @xmath13 emits @xmath82 or @xmath83 photons while running the typical distance @xmath46 or @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "such photons materialize as pairs with probability @xmath84 or @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 denote the x - ray flux inside and outside of ( @xmath44,@xmath45 ) , respectively ; @xmath88 and @xmath88 are the pair - production cross section for inward and outward photons , respectively .",
    "thus , a single @xmath14 or @xmath13 cascades into @xmath89 pairs or into @xmath90 pairs within the gap .",

    "a single inward @xmath14 cascades eventually into @xmath93 inward @xmath14 s , which should become unity for the gap to be self - sustained .",
    "therefore , in a stationary gap , the gap thickness @xmath18 is automatically regulated so that the gap closure condition , @xmath94 may be satisfied .    approximately speaking , a single , inward - migrating @xmath14 emits @xmath95 curvature photons , a portion of which head - on collide the surface x - ray photons to materialize as pairs with probability @xmath96 within the gap .",

    "each produced @xmath13 return outwards to emit @xmath98 photons , which materialize as pairs with probability @xmath99 by tail - on colliding with the surface x - rays . in another word",
    ", @xmath100 holds regardless of the nature of the pair production process ( e.g. , either photon - photon or magnetic process @xcite ) in the lower altitudes , because it is determined by the pair - production efficiency in the outer magnetosphere @xmath101 , which is always due to photon - photon pair production .",
    "in general , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 are expressed in terms of @xmath18 , @xmath4 , @xmath17 , @xmath106 , and @xmath38 , where @xmath106 denotes the ns surface temperature .",
    "note that we can solve @xmath107 as a function of the ns age , @xmath33 , from the spin - down law .",
    "thus , specifying @xmath38 and the cooling curve , @xmath108 , we can solve @xmath18 as a function of @xmath33 from the gap closure condition , @xmath109 .",

    "@xmath0 can be related to @xmath31 with an intermediate parameter @xmath33 , if we specify the cooling curve and the spin - down law .",
    "substituting equations  ( [ eq : s_n1 ] ) and ( [ eq : s_n2 ] ) into ( [ eq : s_stationary ] ) , we obtain @xmath112 where @xmath113 with @xmath114 ; @xmath115 denotes the @xmath6-ray frequency , and @xmath116 the planck function .",
    "we have to integrate over the soft photon frequency @xmath117 above the threshold energy @xmath118 where @xmath119 refers to the rest - mass energy of the electron .",
    "the cosine of the collision angle @xmath120 becomes @xmath121 for outward ( or @xmath122 for inward ) @xmath6-rays .",

    "an accurate evaluation of @xmath127 requires a careful treatment of the collision geometry , because the threshold energy , @xmath128 , strongly depends on the tiny collision angles . in the numerical method ( next section ) , the pair - production absorption coefficient is explicitly computed at each point in the three - dimensional pulsar magnetosphere by equation  ( [ eq : def_alf2 ] ) .",
    "however , in this section , for analytical purpose , we simply adopt the empirical relation , @xmath129 where @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 for @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 , respectively ; @xmath136 .",

    "for a smaller @xmath38 , the point ( @xmath50,@xmath51 ) is located in the higher altitudes , where the magnetic field lines begin to collimate along the rotation axis , deviating from the static dipole configuration .",
    "thus , the collision angles near the light cylinder , and hence @xmath127 decreases with decreasing @xmath38 .",
    "the explicit value of @xmath139 can be computed only numerically , solving the photon specific intensity from infrared to @xmath6-ray energies in the three - dimensional pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "the last factor , @xmath140 , in the left - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : s_master ] ) is given by @xmath141 thus , equation  ( [ eq : s_master ] ) gives @xmath142 where the @xmath44 dependence vanishes .",

    "note that the @xmath38 dependence of the spin - down law is not essential for the present purpose ; thus , @xmath151 is simply adopted .",
    "once @xmath152 is obtained , equation  ( [ eq : lg_0 ] ) readily gives @xmath0 as a function of @xmath33 , and hence of @xmath31 .",
    "it is worth noting that the heated polar - cap emission is relatively weak compared to the cooling ns emission , except for millisecond or middle - aged pulsars .",
    "let us now consider the cooling scenario . since the mass of psr  j1614 - 2230 is precisely measured to be @xmath153 ( i.e. , @xmath154 solar masses ) , and since other three nss ( 4u1700 - 377 , b1957 + 20 , and j1748 - 2021b ) @xcite are supposed to be heavier than @xmath155 , we exclude the equation of state ( eos ) that gives smaller maximum mass than @xmath156 .",
    "that is , we do not consider the fast cooling scenario due to direct urca process in a hyperon - mixed , pion - condensed , kaon - condensed , or quark - deconfined core , which gives softer eos and hence a smaller maximum mass . even without exotic matters , the direct urca process may also become important in the core of a ns with the mass that is slightly less than the maximum mass .",
    "however , in the present paper , we exclude such relatively rare cases and adopt the canonical value , @xmath157 , as the ns mass .    on these ground",
    ", we adopt the minimal cooling scenario @xcite , which has no enhanced cooling that could result from any of the direct urca processes and employs the standard eos , apr eos @xcite . within the minimal cooling scenario , the cooling history of",
    "a ns substantially depends on the composition of the envelope , which is defined as the upper - most layer extending from the photosphere down to a boundary where the luminosity in the envelope equals the total surface luminosity of the star .",
    "an envelope contains a strong temperature gradient and has a thickness around @xmath158 meters .",
    "we adopt the cooling curves given in @xcite and consider the two extreme cases : light element and heavy element envelopes . because of the uncertainty in the modeling of neutron @xmath159 ( i.e. , spin - singlet state ) cooper paring temperature ( as a function of neutron fermi momentum ) and proton @xmath159 paring temperature ( as a function of proton fermi momentum ) , the predicted @xmath138 distributes in a band for each chemical composition of the envelope .",
    "when a ns is younger than @xmath160 , a light element envelope ( contaminated by e.g. , h , he , c , or o with masses exceeding @xmath161 ) has a higher surface temperature , and hence a greater luminosity , @xmath138 , compared to a heavy element envelope ( contaminated by light elements with masses less than @xmath162 ) , because the heat transport becomes more efficient in the former . as the ns ages ,",
    "a star with a light element envelope quickly loses its internal energy via photon emission ; as a result , after @xmath163 , it become less luminous than that with a heavy element envelope .",
    "a realistic cooling curve will be located between these two extreme cases , depending on the actual composition of the ns envelope .",
    "we present the solved @xmath18 for a light and a heavy element envelope in figure  [ fig : hm_evol ] , adopting @xmath164 , which gives the magnetic field strength of @xmath165  g at the magnetic pole , where @xmath166  km is used .",
    "it follows that the gap becomes thinner for a light element case ( between the thin and thick dotted curves , blue shaded region ) than for the heavy element cases ( between the thin and thick dashed curves , red shaded region ) .",
    "this is because the more luminous photon field of a light element envelope leads to a copious pair production , which prevents the gap to expand in the trans - field direction . as a result",
    ", the predicted @xmath0 becomes less luminous for a light element envelope than a heavy one .    in figure",
    "[ fig : lglsp_1 ] , we present the analytical results of @xmath0 versus @xmath31 as the dotted ( or dashed ) curve for a light ( or a heavy ) element envelope .",
    "as the pulsar spins down , @xmath0 evolves leftwards .",
    "in this section , for analytical purpose , we are not interested in the dependence on the observer s viewing angle , @xmath167 .",
    "thus , in equation  ( [ eq : lg_0 ] ) , we simply put @xmath168 .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath0 little evolves for a light element envelope , because of @xmath65 , as discussed after equation  ( [ eq : s_th0 ] ) .",
    "precisely speaking , we obtain @xmath169 and hence @xmath170 ( or @xmath171 and hence @xmath172 ) for a light ( or a heavy ) element envelope . that is ,",
    "although @xmath18 is smaller , @xmath18 increases more rapidly in a light element case than in a heavy element case , which enables a constant @xmath0 for a light element envelope . at later stage ,",
    "@xmath173 years , both @xmath18 and @xmath0 increase with decreasing @xmath31 for a light element envelope , because @xmath174 , and hence the pair production rate , rapidly decreases with increasing @xmath33 . on the other hand , for a heavy element envelope , their greater @xmath18 results in a monotonically decreasing @xmath0 with decreasing @xmath31 .",
    "let us develop the analytical examination and look deeper into a self - consistent solution by a numerical method . to this end",
    ", we adopt the modern outer - gap model @xcite and solve the set of maxwell and boltzmann equations self - consistently and compute @xmath11 , distribution functions of @xmath23 s , and the photon specific intensity at each point in the three - dimensional pulsar magnetosphere .",

    "we obtain @xmath341 to solve the poisson equation , we put @xmath325 at @xmath342 , or equivalently , at @xmath343 . if @xmath65 , the gap becomes thin , whereas @xmath344 indicates that the gap is threaded by most of the open - field lines .",
    "note that the open field lines cross the pc surface at magnetic co - latitudes @xmath345 ( i.e. , @xmath346 ) , and that @xmath215 ( i.e. , @xmath347 ) corresponds to the magnetic axis",

    ", we can solve the acceleration electric field @xmath11 , particle distribution functions @xmath264 , and the photon specific intensity @xmath275 ( from @xmath348  ev to @xmath349  tev ) , at each position in the three - dimensional magnetosphere of arbitrary rotation - powered pulsars , if we specify @xmath4 , @xmath17 , @xmath38 , and @xmath350 , where the surface temperature @xmath350 is necessary to compute the photon - photon pair production through the differential flux @xmath351 in equation  ( [ eq : def_alf2 ] ) .",
    "we adopt the minimum cooling scenario in the same manner as in   [ sec : analytical ] .    in figure  [",
    "fig : lglsp_2 ] , we plot the result of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath31 as the dash - dotted ( or solid ) curve for a light ( or a heavy ) element envelope , where @xmath164 is adopted in the same manner as in the analytical examination .",
    "it follows that these numerical solutions are consistent with the analytical ones , and that @xmath0 decreases slowly until @xmath352 years .",
    "the physical reason why @xmath0 increases with decreasing @xmath31 at @xmath173  years for a light element envelope , is the same as described at the end of ",
    "[ sec : analytical ] .",
    "a realistic ns will have an envelope composition between the two extreme cases , light and heavy elements .",
    "thus , the actual @xmath0 s will distribute between the red solid ( or dashed ) and the blue dash - dotted ( or dotted ) curves .",
    "however , after @xmath0 approaches @xmath31 ( thin dashed straight line ; see @xcite for the death line argument ) , the outer gap survives only along the limited magnetic field lines in the trailing side of the rotating magnetosphere because of a less efficient pair production ; as a result , @xmath0 rapidly decreases with decreasing @xmath31 . for a smaller @xmath38 , even for a light element envelope ,",
    "@xmath0 monotonically decreases as the dash - dot - dot - dot curve shows , because the gap is located in the higher altitudes , and because the less efficient pair production there prevents the produced electric current to increase with decreasing age around @xmath353  years .",
    "it is also worth examining the cutoff energy , @xmath354 , of the gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "we plot @xmath354 as a function of the magnetic - field strength at the light cylinder , @xmath355 , in figure  [ fig : cutoff ] . in the analytical computation ( dash , dotted , and dash - dot - dot - dot curves ) , only the curvature process  @xcite from the particles produced and accelerated in the outer gap , is considered as the photon emission process , and no photon absorption is considered . in the numerical computation ( solid and dash - dotted curves ) ,",
    "on the other hand , synchro - curvature and inverse - compton processes from the particles not only produced and accelerated in the gap but also cascaded outside the gap , are considered as the emission processes , and both the photon - photon and magnetic pair production processes are taken into account when computing the photon propagation .",
    "therefore , for very young pulsars , a strong photon - photon absorption ( and the subsequent production of lower - energy photons via synchrotron and synchrotron - self - compton processes ) takes place even in the higher altitudes . as a result",
    ", spectrum can no longer be fitted by power - law with exponential - cutoff functional form .",
    "thus , for @xmath72  years , the fitted cutoff energies are not plotted for numerical solutions ( i.e. , solid and dash - dotted curves ) .",
    "it follows that the present outer gap model explains the observed tendency that @xmath354 increases with increasing @xmath355 , because the goldreich - julian charge density ( in the gap ) increases with increasing @xmath355 .",
    "it also follows that @xmath354 is regulated below several gev , because copious pair production leads to @xmath65 for young pulsars ( i.e. , for strong @xmath355 ) .",
    "finally , let us investigate the flux correction factor , @xmath28 . to infer the @xmath6-ray luminosity , @xmath356 , from the observed flux , @xmath357",
    ", one has conventionally assumed that the flux conversion factor is approximately unity , @xmath358 , where @xmath359 denotes the distance to the pulsar .",
    "however , now we can compute @xmath28 explicitly as a function of the observer s viewing angle , @xmath167 , using the three - dimensional numerical solution . in figure",
    "[ fig : flux ] , @xmath360 is depicted for heavy and light element envelopes at @xmath361 and @xmath362 years .",
    "it follows that the error of @xmath363 is kept within a factor of @xmath364 with a probability greater than @xmath365 .",
    "when the pulsar is young , @xmath11 is highly screened in the middle and lower altitudes ; as a result , most @xmath6-rays are emitted from the higher altitudes to appear within the observer s viewing angle @xmath366 ( i.e. , @xmath367 ) .",
    "however , as the pulsar ages , more @xmath6-rays are emitted from the middle and lower altitudes , resulting in a stronger flux near the rotational equator , @xmath368 .",
    "to sum up , a light element envelope approximately corresponds to the lower bound of the ( observationally inferred ) gamma - ray luminosity of rotation - powered pulsars , whereas a heavy element one to the upper bound .",
    "the scatter of the intrinsic gamma - ray luminosity is physically determined by the magnetic inclination angle , @xmath38 , and the envelope composition .",
    "the cutoff energy of the primary curvature emission is kept below several gev even for young pulsars , because the gap trans - field thickness , and hence the acceleration electric field , is suppressed by the polarization of the produced pairs in the lower altitudes .    to convert the observed @xmath6-ray flux into luminosity , @xmath0 ,",
    "one has conventionally assumed @xmath168 .",
    "for example , the error bars of the observational data points in figure  [ fig : lglsp_2 ] , do not contain any uncertainties incurred by @xmath28 .",
    "nevertheless , if @xmath38 and @xmath167 can be constrained , we can estimate @xmath0 more accurately , by applying the present quantitative outer - gap calculations .",
    "it is noteworthy that @xmath0 s given in figures  [ fig : lglsp_1 ] and [ fig : lglsp_2 ] little depend on the ns magnetic moment , @xmath17 .",
    "this is particularly true for a light element case , which has @xmath65 , by the reason described after equation  ( [ eq : s_th0 ] ) .",
    "what is more , with an additional determination of @xmath359 ( e.g. , by parallax observations ) , we can infer the composition of individual ns envelopes , by using the constrained flux correction factor , @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : flux ] ) .",
    "we hope to address such a question as the determination of @xmath38 and @xmath167 , and hence @xmath28 , for individual pulsars , by making an atlas of the pulse profiles and phase - resolved spectra that are solved from the basic equations in a wide parameter space of @xmath4 , @xmath17 , @xmath106 , @xmath38 , and @xmath167 , and by comparing the atlas with the observations .",
