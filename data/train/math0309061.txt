    "the goal of this section is to reformulate the problem of minimizing the first dirac eigenvalue in a conformal class as a variational problem .",

    "the dirac operator @xmath5 has a simple behavior under conformal change of the metric , its square @xmath100 transforms in a more complicated way .",

    "many techniques from the resolution of the yamabe problem can be carried over to our setting . however , several arguments from the resolution of the yamabe problem fail .",

    "the spin structure @xmath1 will be fixed ( and often suppressed in the notation ) , whereas the metric @xmath14 varies inside the conformal class @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "some objects will be noted with an index @xmath14 , which means that they are defined with respect to  @xmath14 whereas the same object without the index @xmath14 indicates that it is defined with respect to the fixed background metric @xmath15 ( with some exceptions that are apparent from the context ) .",
    "for example , @xmath107 is the volume element associated to @xmath14 and @xmath108 is the one associated to @xmath15 .",
    "we will frequently use several norms , as for example @xmath109 and @xmath110 that are defined with respect to @xmath15 unless otherwise stated .",
