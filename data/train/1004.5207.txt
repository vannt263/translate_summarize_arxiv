    "in condensed matter physics , several materials containing transition metal atoms ( @xmath1 ) and oxygen have attracted great interest , for example the superconducting cuprates , manganites with high magnetoresistance , and more recently cobaltates and fe pnictides . in the latter , the role of o in the electronic structure is replaced by either p or as .",
    "the electronic structure of these systems near the fermi energy is determined essentially by some d orbitals of @xmath1 and some 2p orbitals of o ( or 3p , 4p for p , as in the pnictides ) , while the rest of the orbitals and elements play the role of reservoirs of charge . in most of these systems ,",
    "strong correlations at @xmath1 play an essential role . for example , while first - principles calculations predict that the undoped cuprates like la@xmath14cuo@xmath15 are non - magnetic metals,@xcite they are in fact antiferromagnetic insulators . in the cobaltates",
    "na@xmath16coo@xmath14 , first - principles calculations @xcite predicted a fermi surface with six prominent hole pockets along the @xmath17 direction , which are absent in measured angle - resolved photoemission spectra.@xcite    because of the presence of strong correlations , numerical methods which treat exactly the interactions in a small cluster of the system have led to a considerable advance in the understanding of these materials.dago,pair,hored,zem,ralko due to the exponential increase of the size of the hilbert space , it is highly desirable that the set of relevant orbitals included in these numerical studies is the smallest possible . for the cuprates , low - energy reduction procedures that eliminate",
    "the o degrees of freedom , simplifying the problem to an effective one - band one , jef , schu , brin , bel , sys , hub , opti have been very successful , in spite of the fact that doped holes enter mainly at o atoms @xcite ( optical properties related with o atoms were calculated using these one - band models @xcite ) .",
    "approximate treatments of the problem are also expected to lead to more accurate results when applied to the effective model , because the construction of the latter begins with an exact treatment of the local interactions at @xmath1 .",
    "for example a slave - boson mean - field treatment applied to the three - band model ( with cu and o orbitals ) for the cuprates predicts a metal for the most accepted parameters,@xcite whereas the same treatment on the one - band effective model gives a gap that agrees with experiment.@xcite    the main idea behind the construction of an effective one - band model for the cuprates , proposed by zhang and rice,@xcite starts from the exact solution of a cuo@xmath15 cluster with one and two holes added to the vacuum in which the cu atoms are in the 3d@xmath18 configuration and the o atoms in the 2p@xmath19 one . for two holes ,",
    "the ground state is a singlet formed essentially by one hole in the 3d@xmath20 orbital of cu and one hole in the linear combination of 2p orbitals of the nearest - neighbor o sites , with the same symmetry . mapping this singlet state onto the corresponding state of a one - band model leads to the usual hubbard or @xmath21 models . using a mapping involving non - orthogonal singlets",
    ", zhang has shown that in a particular case , the mapping is exact.@xcite more systematic derivations lead to additional terms of smaller magnitude,@xcite like three - site terms , which might be important for superconductivity.rvb,manu,pair,suphu three - site terms play also an important role in effective models for vanadates or other systems with @xmath11 electrons.dagh triplet states can be included perturbatively.@xcite    second - order perturbation theory in the cu - o hopping applied to the three - band model for the cuprates leads to an interaction between cu spins and o holes.@xcite adding to it the superexchange interaction between cu spins one has the so called spin - fermion model .",
    "similar derivations have been made for nio,@xcite doped y@xmath14banio@xmath22,@xcite and other perovskites.@xcite an important point is that the parameters of the model are improved if instead of taking the values that result from perturbation theory , they are obtained fitting the energy levels of a cuo@xmath15 cluster in the case of the cuprates @xcite or a nio@xmath23 cluster in the case of the nickelates.@xcite the cu and o photoemission spectra for the cuprates obtained from the resulting spin - fermion model are practically identical to those of the three - band hubbard model but required a much less computational effort for the same cluster.@xcite    the above mentioned results suggest that in general the key for constructing a low - energy hamiltonian is to solve exactly a cluster @xmath1o@xmath24 containing the transition metal atom and the o atoms of its neighborhood .",
    "in fact , the cell - perturbation method @xcite used extensively in the cuprates jef , brin , bel , bel2,hub , opti exploits this idea : it divides the system into orthogonal cells containing one @xmath1 atom each , using appropriate o wannier functions centered at @xmath1 , solves exactly each cell , writes the hamiltonian in the basis of the resulting eigenstates , retains only the relevant low - energy eigenstates , and includes the rest perturbatively .",
    "however , while in the cuprates the o wannier functions can be easily constructed and the hilbert space of the cluster involves only a few eigenstates , in the general case , as we show below , at least ten d and p orbitals are involved . in this case",
    ", the size of the hilbert space of the @xmath1o@xmath24 cluster is @xmath25 and ( except for favorable cases ) the matrices should be solved numerically . for o rich systems , we propose to neglect the overlap between different o clusters and retain only the most important terms in the resulting effective model @xmath0 ( the effect of this overlap in the cuprates was calculated in ref . ) .",
    "a discussion of the effect of the overlap in the cobaltates is contained in section [ overlap ] .",
    "similarly to the above mentioned ideas , the most relevant parameters are obtained from a fit of the low - energy levels of the original @xmath26o  multiband model @xmath27 ( obtained numerically ) and those of @xmath0 in the @xmath1o@xmath24 cluster .",
    "an additional calculation is required to obtain effective hoppings between clusters .",
    "an essential ingredient of the original multiband model @xmath27 is the part of it which contains the interactions between 3d electrons @xmath28 . while it is straightforward to obtain it using known results of atomic physics , the derivation is lengthy and it seems that only simplified forms were used so far for research in these systems .",
    "for example in a recent study of fe pnictides,@xcite a simplified expression derived previously @xcite was used . while the form of @xmath28 is well known when either only @xmath12 orbitals @xcite or only @xmath11 orbitals @xcite are important , the correct expressions were not always used.@xcite in the general case , new terms appear which were not discussed before .",
    "one of the goals of this work is to present the complete @xmath28 .",
    "we believe that this will be useful for future theoretical work on strongly correlated systems of transition metals , when the relevant orbitals can not be restricted to either @xmath12 or @xmath11 only .    in this work ,",
    "we outline the derivation of @xmath0 as described above .",
    "while for the sake of clarity we consider that the relevant non - metal orbitals are the 2p of o atoms , they could also be the 3p of p or 4p of as in the case of the fe pnictides .",
    "we consider in detail the specific example of the cobaltates na@xmath16coo@xmath14 .",
    "a brief description of this case , together with a dynamical - mean field treatment of @xmath0 to study the electronic structure and fermi surface of the system was published before.@xcite    in section ii , we describe the construction of the multiband model containing both @xmath1 3d ( or 4d ) and o 2p ( or p 3p , as 4p ) electrons , including all the d - d interaction terms . in section iii , we derive the effective hamiltonian @xmath0 , which contains only effective d operators but no o ones . while some considerations are valid for the general case , the explicit construction is done for the case of na@xmath16coo@xmath14 .",
    "section iv is a summary and discussion .",
    "as in many transition - metal compounds , we assume that the essential part of the electronic structure consists of the d electrons of the transition - metal atoms and the p electrons of the o ( or other non - metal ) atoms .",
    "an example in which only one d orbital is relevant is the three - band hubbard model for the cuprates,@xcite with parameters determined by constrained - density - functional theory.@xcite the hamiltonian contains d - p hopping terms and interactions .",
    "the most important of the latter are the interaction terms among the d electrons .      here",
    "we can consider only one transition - metal atom and drop the site index for simplicity .",
    "the part of the hamiltonian that contains the interaction among the 10 d spin - orbitals is @xcite    @xmath29    where @xmath30 creates an electron or a hole at  the spin - orbital @xmath31 ( @xmath28 is invariant under an electron - hole transformation ) and    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the wave function of the spin - orbital @xmath31 .    in the basis of given angular momentum and spin projections ( @xmath34 ) , the orbital part of the wave functions can be written as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the radial part and @xmath37 is a normalized spherical harmonic .",
    "using standard methods of atomic physics @xcite one obtains    @xmath38    with    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is a normalized legendre function and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) is the smaller ( larger ) between @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the values of @xmath45 that are needed are tabulated in ref . .",
    "to remove uncomfortable denominators , one defines the three free parameters as @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48.@xcite    in the presence of a cubic crystal field ( point group @xmath49 ) or some other local symmetry ( for example point groups @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) , it is more convenient to change from the basis of operators with definite angular momentum projection @xmath54 to that of irreducible representations of the point group ( @xmath12 and @xmath11 for @xmath49 ) orbitals using    @xmath55    in cubic symmetry , @xmath56 and @xmath57 correspond to @xmath12 symmetry and the remaining creation operators transform as the @xmath11 irreducible representation .",

    "@xmath28 can be divided in four parts @xmath58 according to the number @xmath6 of @xmath12 operators present in each term .",

    "@xmath97 ev has been estimated by constrained - density - functional calculations cdf1,cdf2 and it decreases to the left of the periodic table inside the 3d series , because the 3d orbitals are more extended as a consequence of the smaller nuclear charge .",

    "we have neglected the trigonal distortion and assumed @xmath49 symmetry in the cluster .",
    "as shown above , this assumption reduces the size of the relevant hilbert space and in addition simplifies significantly the mapping between states of @xmath27 and @xmath0 , because as we shall see , the symmetry identifies unambiguously the correspondence between states of both hamiltonians .",
    "the effective trigonal crystal - field splitting @xmath135 ev was given by quantum - chemistry configuration - interaction calculations.@xcite as we discuss in more detail below , this is one order of magnitude smaller than the effective cubic crystal - field splitting and does not affect our main findings .",

    "a similar effect is caused by the addition of the second effective 3d @xmath11 hole ( with larger magnitude for the states of lowest energy ) .",
    "this is a combined effect of the interorbital coulomb repulsion , which increases the energy of the @xmath12 holes when @xmath11 holes are added , and the strong hopping between 3d @xmath12 holes and linear combinations of o holes with the same symmetry .",
    "the degree of covalency of the @xmath11 states is less than that of the @xmath12 ones , due to the fact that the 3d-2p hopping is a factor 2 larger for the latter [ see eqs .",

    "the first four terms of @xmath157 ( the simplest ones ) , containing the coulomb repulsion between d @xmath12 and @xmath11 electrons are crucial to obtain the right distribution of particles and should be retained .",
    "keeping the prefactors and neglecting the rest of the terms of @xmath156 and @xmath157 , the cubic @xmath49 symmetry is lost .",
    "therefore , to retain the @xmath49 symmetry , we have replaced these coulomb repulsions by the average of all of them .    all energies increase with respect to those of the full hamiltonian . in particular for the states corresponding to nominal co@xmath144 ( second row of table i ) , the energy increases by 0.92 ev . however , the distribution of holes is not dramatically affected .",
    "there is a 10 % reduction in the amount of d  @xmath11 from 0.91 to 0.82 which distribute evenly among other orbitals .",
    "similar effects take place for nominal co@xmath145 .",
    "the resulting effective repulsions are decreased considerably .",
    "proceeding as indicated above we obtain @xmath187 ev , @xmath188 ev ( 35% less than for the full hamiltonian ) , @xmath189 ev , and @xmath190 ev .    of course , the changes should be more dramatic when the effective cubic splitting ( @xmath164 plus effects of co - o hopping ) is smaller ( like for other co compounds ) , since for spherical symmetry all terms of exchange and transfer of intraorbital pairs are equally important .",
    "as shown first by koshibae and maekawa,@xcite the main hopping path from one co site to a neighboring co site in na@xmath16coo@xmath14 is via an intermediate o site .",

    "we have checked numerically that the perturbative expression @xmath191 is recovered for large @xmath208 .    to calculate the matrix elements ,",
    "we have used the simplified hamiltonian , neglecting some terms of @xmath156 and @xmath157 as described above . with the parameters derived from optical experiments [ eq .",
    "( [ par ] ) ] , we obtain @xmath209 ev , which is in very good agreement with the estimate of ref . .",
    "the final form of the non - interacting part of the effective hamiltonian contains the trigonal distortion @xmath210 ev and a smaller direct hopping between co ions @xmath211.@xcite these terms are beyond our calculations based on the diagonalization of a coo@xmath23 cluster .",
    "the former because we assumed @xmath49 symmetry and the latter because direct co - co hopping can not be included in the cluster",
    ". nevertheless , the largest energies in the problem are the interactions given by eqs .",
    "( [ pareff ] ) within our approach .",
    "note that the value of the trigonal splitting @xmath212 is an order of magnitude smaller than the effective cubic crystal field ( near 3 ev including the effects of co - o hybridization ) and therefore does not sensibly affect the derivation of the remaining parameters of @xmath0 , which were obtained assuming @xmath213 symmetry .",
    "while in @xmath0 one assumes a basis with orthogonal states , the states of @xmath27 involved in the calculation of @xmath203 above are non - orthogonal , due to the fact that some p orbitals belong to different clusters . in the cuprates,@xcite and in double perovskites,@xcite the problem of non - orthogonality has been solved by a change of basis to orthogonal wannier functions centered at transition - metal atoms . in the present case , in which five different 2p o wannier functions centered at each co site should be considered ,",
    "this procedure can not be handled analytically and becomes very awkward .",
    "fortunately , the larger number of orbitals involved has also the consequence that the overlap between many - body states is considerably reduced with respect to those of the one - particle wannier functions .",
    "this also takes place to a lesser extent in the cuprates , in which the overlap between zhang - rice states is s=-1/8 , and leads to a rapidly convergent expansion of @xmath0 in terms of s.@xcite    furthermore , a close examination of the structure of na@xmath8coo@xmath9 shows that in all non - zero elements of the overlap matrix between bonding combinations of o 2p orbitals [ see eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) ] , at least one o @xmath11 orbital is involved . since the occupation of the latter is small in the relevant many - body eigenstates ( see table i ) ,",
    "the overlap between the latter is reduced . in particular",
    "we find    @xmath214    where for simplicity , we denoted as @xmath215 ( @xmath216 ) , the many - body state in which all clusters except @xmath104 ( @xmath107 ) are in the ground state for four holes and the remaining cluster is in the lowest lying state for 5 holes and symmetry @xmath217 ( @xmath197 ) .",
    "to first order in the overlaps @xmath218 , @xmath219 , orthonormal states can be obtained using    @xmath220    then    @xmath221    where @xmath222 . since by symmetry @xmath223",
    ", the above result can be written as    @xmath224    except for the sign , the second member coincides with the second member of eq .",
    "( [ teff ] ) .",
    "therefore the result previously obtained is not modified by terms linear in the overlap .",
    "we have constructed the cell hamiltonian @xmath225 that consists of a transition - metal atom @xmath1 and its neighboring o atoms .",
    "this hamiltonian is the basis to construct a low - energy effective model @xmath0 in which the o atoms are eliminated , using the cell - perturbation method.jef,brin,bel,bel2,hub,opti the hamiltonian has the same form if o is replaced by other elements with p states near the fermi energy , like p or as in the fe pnictides .",
    "an essential part of the cell hamiltonian and the full starting hamiltonian @xmath27 is the interaction between electrons inside the d shell @xmath81 when all 10 spin - orbitals are important .",
    "we have constructed @xmath226 in a basis of orbitals appropriate for a cubic , hexagonal , tetragonal or tetrahedral environment of the @xmath1 atoms .",
    "for other symmetries a change of basis may be required .",
    "while @xmath81 has a trivial form @xmath227 in the hubbard model where only one orbital per site @xmath107 is relevant , the interaction contains interorbital coulomb repulsion , exchange and pair hopping terms when only either @xmath228 [ eq.([h4 ] ) ] or @xmath11 [ eq.(h0 ) ] are involved .",
    "these already makes the physics of transition - metal compounds richer than that of the hubbard model.dagh,oles,epl,oles2,fre,gus,vol,rodo    if all orbitals should be retained , more complicated terms appear [ eqs .",
    "( h1 ) and ( [ h2 ] ) ] .",
    "our results suggest that because of the large @xmath1-o hopping for @xmath228 holes in cubic or tetragonal symmetry , they should be retained in general , even if the formal configuration of @xmath1 contains 6 d electrons or less ( corresponding to only @xmath11 electrons in a ionic picture ) .    in the case of the cobaltates na@xmath16coo@xmath14 , where mainly 3d@xmath229 and 3d@xmath230 configurations play a role ,",
    "our results as well as previous ones , mari2 show that addition or removal of electrons in the d shell causes a strong charge redistribution between metal @xmath228 states and linear combination of 2p o states with the same symmetry .",
    "this has important consequences for the parameters of @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , the effective coulomb repulsion @xmath184 is smaller than previously assumed in calculations of @xmath0 which include the effect of correlations.@xcite as a consequence if the hopping parameters and the trigonal distortion @xmath13 are obtained from a fit of the bands obtained from first principles , six hole pockets appear along the @xmath17 directions,@xcite which are not detected in photoemission experiments.@xcite instead , using the values of the interactions and effective hopping obtained as described in the previous section , and the larger value of @xmath13 given by quantum - chemistry configuration - interaction calculations,@xcite these pockets are absent according to calculations which apply the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) to @xmath0.@xcite the resulting electronic dispersion near the fermi energy agrees with experiment .",
    "recent photoemission experiments in misfit cobaltates show results similar as previous ones , with a significant band reduction due to correlations.@xcite    in general , the local - density approximation ( lda ) underestimates gaps and one - particle excitations energies . thus one might suspect that it underestimates the trigonal distortion energy @xmath13 in the cobaltates .",
    "the above results suggest that taking the one - body parameters of the effective model @xmath0 with metal sites only from a fit of the bands obtained in lda is not valid in general , or at least when the degree of covalency is important .",
    "this is also the case of nio , for which agreement with experiment in lda+dmft calculations is only achieved once the o bands are explicitly included in the model,@xcite or when the o atoms have been integrated out using low - energy reduction procedures similar as ours , which take into account correlations from the beginning @xcite .",
    "the research in the superconducting cuprates also supports the above statement . in this case , the parameters of the effective one - band hubbard or @xmath21 models are obtained accurately using systematic low - energy reduction procedures @xcite from a multiorbital cu - o model @xcite with parameters obtained from constrained - density - functional theory.@xcite    for the cobaltates , we have determined the parameters of the original multiorbital model form a fit of polarized x - ray absorption spectra of na@xmath16coo@xmath14.@xcite",
