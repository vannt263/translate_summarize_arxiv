    "the present survey paper is devoted to the recent progress in the new branch of dynamical systems theory which we call _ arithmetic dynamics _ ( ad ) .",
    "it is worth pointing out that there is no conventional agreement regarding what the expression ad actually stands for  at the moment when i am writing these words ( the year  2002 ) , different people seem to see it differently ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "this is not particularly surprising : since the term is not fixed , anything that has something to do with arithmetics and dynamics may qualify .",
    "nonetheless , in the present paper the scope will be more narrow than that ; namely , we define ad as a discipline which deals with symbolic codings of continuous ( or measure - preserving ) dynamical systems ( invertible or not ) expressed in terms of * explicit * arithmetic expansions of real numbers of vectors .",
    "if one accepts this ( rather vague ) definition , the classic ergodic theory of continued fractions , for instance , quite fits into the scope of ad .",
    "the term in question in this setting was suggested first by a.  vershik in the mid-1990 s ( implying that it would be suitable for a full - developed theory in the future ) .    the expansions in questions will be usually called _",
    "arithmetic codings_. here are some characteristic features of arithmetic codings :    * they extensively use number - theoretic methods and techniques ; * the arithmetic structure possessed by dynamical systems we encode , is fully preserved ; * as long as there are no obstacles of number - theoretic nature , they can be generalized .",
    "apart from the  normal \" ( i.e. , one - to - one a.e . ) expansions , there exists another important topic that may be regarded as a part of ad , namely , the theory of _ redundant _ or _ excessive _ representations of real numbers and vectors .",
    "the model is as follows : assume we have a fixed  normal \" expansion and the natural set of its  digits \" is not a cartesian product but has , for instance , pairwise ( or even more sophisticated ) restrictions .",
    "our goal is to study the pattern , in which we lift all the restrictions between * distinct * digits and leave only the minimal cartesian hull for the original set of digits .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath0-expansions with a non - integer @xmath0 ( see below ) this eventually leads to the well - known _",
    "bernoulli convolutions_. special attention will be paid to the combinatorics of * all * representations of a given @xmath1 as well as to the set of those @xmath1 which despite lifting the restrictions , will have a _ unique representation _ in the class in question .",
    "one important point has to be made : ad is still in the cradle , so to speak , i.e. , definitely not yet a  full - scale \" subarea of dynamical systems . here",
    "are its lacks :    * at present there is hardly any systematic approach that would cover a more or less substantial variety of measure - preserving ( or continuous ) transformations . on the contrary , as we will see , for each class of maps under consideration the model turns out to be state - of - the - art . *",
    "another serious issue regarding ad is that the constructions in question are not yet quite robust and strongly depend on the arithmetic structure of a dynamical system in question .    despite all this",
    ", most constructions look rather nice and are closely related to number - theoretic problems as well ( especially for arithmetic codings of toral automorphisms ) .",
    "thus , we believe that even in this intermediate state ad is worth a detailed description , with the hope that some day it will become an area with a more systematic approach . such a description is the aim of the present paper .",
    "our intention is mostly to summarize the progress in ad in the recent 10 years .",
    "the reason for this particular figure is a.  vershik s seminal paper @xcite which appeared in the winter of 199192 and which has stimulated quite a number of new works and a great deal of ideas in ad .",
    "this paper presents an arithmetic coding of the fibonacci automorphism of the 2-torus ( see section  [ ac ] for the definitions ) based on the two - sided generalization of the corresponding adic transformation suggested by the same author in the late 1970 s @xcite ( see section  [ re ] and appendix ) .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : * section  [ be ] * is devoted to the _",
    "@xmath0-expansions _ , i.e. , radix representations in ( generally speaking , non - integer ) bases @xmath0 with @xmath2 . in particular , we will briefly outline some well - known results about the _",
    "greedy _ and _ lazy _ beta - expansions , then describe in detail the recent progress in the theory of _ unique _ beta - representations in a fixed alphabet and finally , will deal with the space of _ all _ beta - representations of a given real number .",
    "besides , we are going to devote a part of this section to the case of the one - parameter family of _ intermediate _ beta - expansions , i.e. , those which lie in between greedy and lazy ones ( in the sense of the lexicographic ordering ) .    * section  [ re ] * deals with , generally speaking , quite a different subject , namely , arithmetic codings of a dynamical system with a purely discrete cyclic spectrum . more precisely , we present two models for adic realization of an irrational rotation of the circle @xmath3 .",
    "both schemes deal with expansions of the elements of @xmath4 in bases involving the sequence of best approximation of the angle of rotation , which we call _ rotational expansions_. in this case the compacta we obtain , are , generally speaking , non - stationary , and the map is not a traditional shift but the _ adic transformation _",
    "( see appendix for the definition ) .",
    " the two models coincide if the angle of rotation is @xmath5 for some @xmath6 . ]",
    "this map is in a way transversal to the shift ( if the latter is well defined ) .",
    "putting it simply , the adic transformation is a generalization of the  adding machine \" in the ring of @xmath7-adic integers to more general markov compacta .",
    "we study the distribution of the  digits \" in both cases and give sufficient conditions for the laws of large numbers and the central limit theorem to hold for them . in the end of section  [ re ] we  similarly to section  [ be ]  consider the set of unique rotational expansions , prove a number of claims that fully describe it and discuss the effect of non - stationarity , which leads to an essential difference with the beta - expansions .",
    "finally , in * section  [ ac ] * we consider arithmetic codings of hyperbolic automorphisms of a torus ; as was mentioned above , it was a discovery in this area that initiated most of the research in ad in the last 10 years .",
    "after the model case of the _ fibonacci automorphism _ of @xmath8 , i.e. , the one given by the matrix @xmath9 , was studied in detail in @xcite , a.  vershik @xcite asked the question whether it is possible to generalize this construction to all hyperbolic ( or even ergodic ) automorphisms .",
    "more precisely , is it possible to find a symbolic coding of a given automorphism @xmath10 such that certain structures ( the stable and unstable foliation , homoclinic points ) have a clear expression in the corresponding symbolic compactum .",
    "as is well known , the classical models that deal with markov partitions @xcite do not have this property ( apart from possibly the case of dimension two ) .",
    "thus , in section  [ ac ] we describe the evolution of this area in the past 10 years .",
    "this includes the fibonacci automorphism ( as well as ergodic automorphisms of the 2-torus considered in @xcite ) , the pisot automorphisms , i.e. those whose unstable ( or stable ) foliation is one - dimensional , and finally , we will try to summarize all attempts to cope with the general hyperbolic case and the difficulties that occur in doing so .",
    "* appendix * serves mostly auxiliary purposes : it briefly describes the theory of adic transformations .",
    "the experienced reader will notice , of course , that some topics that might be in this survey paper , are missing .",
    "the reason for this is that either a nice exposition of the corresponding theory and results can be found elsewhere or the similarity with the actual framework of ad , however broad it is , is imaginary .",
    "here is the list of some areas and subjects in question :    * _ odometers_. by this word is usually implied the adic transformation ( see appendix ) on a general compact set ( not necessarily a markov compactum ) with some extra  fullness \" conditions  see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "i am still not convinced though that the odometers are really natural : as far as i am concerned , there are no interesting examples of symbolic codings of non - symbolic dynamical systems by means of odometers . * _ algebraic codings of higher - rank actions on a torus_. the reader may refer to the paper by einsiedler and schmidt @xcite , in which a general construction ( similar to the one from @xcite discussed in section  [ ac ] ) was suggested .",
    "there are also some partial results in this direction that can be found in the author s paper @xcite . *",
    "_ measures of arithmetic nature_. by those we mean mainly bernoulli - type convolutions parameterized by a pisot number .",
    "the information about them can be found , for example , in @xcite ( see also references therein ) .    since this is a survey paper , the proofs in the text",
    "are usually omitted ; exception is made for a few new results , namely , theorem  [ gencase ] and all claims in section  [ ure ] as well as some more minor claims .",
    "the author is indebted to anatoly vershik for helpful suggestions , remarks and historical data .",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath11 ; we call any representation of the form    @xmath12    a _ @xmath0-expansion _ ( or _ beta - expansion _ if we do not want to specify the base ) .",
    "we need to make one historical remark .",
    "the matter is that in the literature the beta - expansion is often the one that uses the greedy algorithm for obtaining the  digits \" @xmath13 ( see section  [ greedy ] ) ; we acknowledge this tradition ( which apparently dates back to b.  parry s pioneering work @xcite ) , but think that within this text it would only cause confusion , because we intend to describe different types of algorithms for one and the same @xmath0 .",
    "this subsection is one of the few exceptions we have made from the rule that only the recent progress will be discussed .",
    "the reason for doing so is simple : without clear exposition of this model , it is impossible to explain the importance of ideas developed in recent papers . in this subsection",
    "we will confine ourselves mostly to the case of @xmath14 ( although beta - expansions can be extended to the positive half - axis as well  see lemma  [ half ] ) .",
    "so , let @xmath15 be the _ @xmath0-transformation _ ,",
    "i.e. , the map from @xmath16 onto itself acting by the formula @xmath17 ( see figure  [ beta - shift ] ) .",
    "-shift , width=302 ]    this map is very important in ergodic theory and as well as number theory , and the main tool for its study is its symbolic encoding which we are going to describe below . note that if @xmath18 is an integer , then @xmath15 is isomorphic to the full shift on @xmath19 symbols .",
    "the idea suggested in @xcite was to generalize this construction to the non - integer @xmath0 s .",
    "as is well known , to  encode \" it , one needs to apply the greedy algorithm in order to obtain the digits in ( [ beta - exp ] ) , namely , @xmath20,\\ n\\ge1 $ ] .",
    "then the one - sided shift @xmath21 in the space @xmath22 of all possible sequences @xmath23 that can be obtained this way , is clearly isomorphic to @xmath15 , with the conjugating map given by ( [ beta - exp ] ) .",
    "we will call @xmath21 the _ @xmath0-shift_. it is obviously a proper subshift of the full shift on @xmath24\\}$ ] .",
    "the question is , what kind of subshift is this  or equivalently ",
    "what is actually @xmath22 ?",
    "this question was answered by b.  parry in the seminal paper @xcite .",
    "the theorem he proved is the following .",
    "let the sequence @xmath25 be defined as follows : let @xmath26 be the greedy expansion of 1 , i.e , @xmath27,\\ n\\ge1 $ ] ; if the tail of the sequence @xmath28 differs from @xmath29 , then we put @xmath30 .",
    "otherwise let @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "@xcite[pabe ]    1 .   for any sequence @xmath25 described above",
    ", each power of its shift is lexicographically less than or equal to the sequence itself , and the equality occurs if and only if it is purely periodic .",
    "conversely , each sequence having this property is @xmath33 for some @xmath2.[p1 ] 2",
    ".   for each greedy expansion @xmath34 in base @xmath35 is lexicographically less ( notation : @xmath36 ) than @xmath37 for every @xmath38 .",
    "conversely , every sequence with this property is actually the greedy expansion in base @xmath0 for some @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath40 and @xmath41 stands for the general one - sided shift on sequences .",
    "thus , we have @xmath42\\}\\mid { \\sigma}^n{\\varepsilon}\\prec\\mathbf{a},\\ n\\ge0\\right\\}\\ ] ] and the following diagram commutes : @xmath43 note that usually @xmath22 is called the ( one - sided ) _",
    "@xmath44-compactum_.    types of subshifts people know well how to deal with are mostly sft ( subshifts of finite type ) and their factors , called _ sofic subshifts _  see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "it is thus natural to ask whether @xmath22 is such and if so , for which @xmath0 ? the following theorem gives a rather disappointing answer to this question .",
    "roughly speaking , only certain algebraic @xmath0 yield sofic beta - compacta . recall that an algebraic integer is called a _ pisot number _ if it is a real number greater than 1 and all its conjugates are less than 1 in modulus .",
    "perron number _ is an algebraic integer @xmath0 greater than 1 whose conjugates are less than @xmath0 in modulus .",
    "@xcite ( see also the survey @xcite ) [ sofic ]    1 .   the @xmath0-compactum @xmath22 is an sft if and only if the sequence @xmath45 ( see above ) is finite ( i.e. , its tail is @xmath29 ) .",
    "@xmath22 is sofic if and only if @xmath46 is ultimately periodic .",
    "3 .   if @xmath0 is a pisot number , then @xmath22 is sofic .",
    "4 .   if @xmath22 is sofic , then @xmath0 is a perron number .",
    "it has to be said that a more or less explicit description of @xmath22 in case of transcendental @xmath0 ( as well as for @xmath47 , say ) seems to be hopeless ",
    "see @xcite . however , the ergodic - theoretic properties of the beta - shift are well studied and clearly understood by now for all @xmath2 .",
    "the following statement summarizes them .",
    "@xcite    1 .",
    "the @xmath0-transformation is topologically mixing , and its topological entropy is equal to @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath0-shift is intrinsically ergodic for any @xmath2 .",
    "[ ier ] 3 .",
    "the unique measure of maximal entropy for @xmath15 is equivalent to the lebesgue measure on @xmath49 $ ] and the corresponding density is bounded from both sides .",
    "the natural extension of @xmath15 is bernoulli .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0-shift @xmath21 is weakly bernoulli with respect to the natural ( coordinate - wise ) partition .",
    "the proof of item  ( [ ier ] ) given in @xcite is rather complicated .",
    "in fact , i do not really understand why the proof of the intrinsic ergodicity of the transitive subshifts of finite type given by b.  parry ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) can not be applied to the @xmath0-shifts as well .",
    "the only property one needs apart from ergodicity , is the fact that the measure of any cylinder of length  @xmath50 divided by @xmath51 is uniformly bounded .",
    "this is well known since @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "a simplified proof of the above theorem was given .",
    "it is based on some auxiliary results on _ coded systems _ ( which the @xmath0-shift is  see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , this manuscript , rather helpful from the methodological point of view , is unpublished and not very easy to get hold of .",
    "the greedy expansion can be alternatively characterized as follows : assume that @xmath52 and that the first @xmath53 digits of the expansion  ( [ beta - exp ] ) are already chosen",
    ". then if there is a choice for @xmath13 , we choose the largest possible number between 0 and @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "similarly , if we choose the smallest possible @xmath13 every time when we have a choice , this expansion is called the _",
    "lazy @xmath0-expansion_. let us formally explain what we mean by the existence of a choice . let @xmath55 ; if @xmath56 , then @xmath13 has be to equal to 0 .",
    "if , on the contrary , @xmath57{\\beta}^{-n}$ ] , then inevitably @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "as is easy to see , in any other case there will be a choice for @xmath13 .",
    "the following assertion is straightforward :    for a given @xmath59 , each of its @xmath0-expansions of the form  ( [ beta - exp ] ) lies between its lazy and greedy @xmath0-expansions in the sense of lexicographic ordering of sequences.[int ]    we will return to the case of  intermediate \" expansions ( i.e. , those that lie strictly between the lazy and greedy ones ) in section  [ intermediate ] .

    ". we will call it the _ two - sided @xmath0-compactum _ ; it will be used extensively in section  [ ac ] .",
    "[ half ] any @xmath11 has the greedy @xmath0-expansion of the form @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a sequence from @xmath65 finite to the left , i.e. , @xmath66 for @xmath67 for some @xmath68 .",
    "the proof of this claim is similar to the one on the @xmath7-adic representations of positive reals , and we omit it ( see also section  [ ac ] ) .",
    "this subsection is aimed to describe a branch of a relatively new direction in the theory of arithmetic expansions , which deals with lifting all restrictions on  digits \" leaving only the  cartesian hull \" ( see introduction ) .",
    "assume first that @xmath70 and let @xmath71 .",
    "in the previous subsection we have described the specific ( greedy ) algorithm for choosing  digits \" @xmath13 .",
    "as we have seen , the cost for this ( very natural ) approach is that the set of digits is quite complicated and unless @xmath0 is an algebraic number , there is hardly any hope to describe it more or less explicitly ( see theorem  [ sofic ] ) .    in the 1990 s a group of hungarian mathematicians led by paul",
    "erds began to investigate 0 - 1 sequences that provide * unique * representations of reals @xcite .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath72 ( it is obvious that the only representation for @xmath73 is @xmath29 and the only representation for @xmath74 is @xmath75 , so we will exclude both ends of the interval ) .    the first result about this set is given in @xcite :    [ leb=0 ] the set @xmath76 has lebesgue measure zero for any @xmath77 . moreover , if @xmath78 , where @xmath79 , then in fact every @xmath1 has @xmath80 representations in the form  ( [ beta - exp ] ) .",
    "the question is , what can one say about the cardinality and  in case it is the continuum  about the hausdorff dimension of this set .",
    "the answer to this question is given by p.  glendinning and the author in @xcite .",
    "to present this result , we need some preliminaries .",
    "let @xmath81 denote the _ komornik - loreti constant _ introduced by v.  komornik and p.  loreti in @xcite , which is defined as the unique solution of the equation @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the thue - morse sequence @xmath84 i.e. , the fixed point of the substitution @xmath85 .",
    "the komornik - loreti constant is known to be transcendental @xcite , and its numerical value is approximately as follows : @xmath86 the reason why this constant was introduced in @xcite is that it proves to be the smallest number @xmath0 such that @xmath87 has a unique representation in the form  ( [ beta - exp ] ) .",
    "now we are ready to formulate the result we mentioned above .",

    "the proof of this result given in @xcite is based on the observation that for @xmath23 to be a unique expansion for some @xmath93 , it has to be its both greedy and lazy expansion  this is a direct consequence of lemma  [ int ] .",
    "let @xmath94 and @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is given by ( [ beta - exp ] ) .",
    "it suffices to use ( [ xbe ] ) and a similar condition for the lazy expansion , which leads to the following lemma on the structure of the set @xmath97 :    @xcite [ ubeta ] the set @xmath97 can be described as follows : @xmath98    it is worth noting that although ( [ xbe ] ) looks similar to ( [ uq ] ) , the compacta @xmath22 and @xmath97 are completely different . in particular , the entropy of the @xmath0-shift is @xmath48 and in the case of the shift on @xmath97 it is constant a.e .  see theorem  [ erg - prop ] below . note also that restrictions like ( [ uq ] ) are quite common in one - dimensional dynamics , and this is not a coincidence  see @xcite .    from lemma  [ ubeta ] one can obtain the result on the cardinality of @xmath97 and therefore of @xmath99 as well  see @xcite .",
    "the problem with this proof is that it may be characterized as  a rabbit out of a hat \" type of proof .",
    "indeed , it does not say anything about the origin of the komornik - loreti constant as the main threshold between countable and uncountable set of uniquely representable points .",
    "this collision was overcome in the subsequent papers by the same authors @xcite .",

    "this section is devoted to the arithmetic codings of hyperbolic automorphisms of a torus .",
    "the idea of a coding is to expand the points of a torus in power series in base its homoclinic point .",
    "it was suggested by a.  vershik in special cases @xcite and developed by the author and a.  vershik in @xcite in dimension  2 and in higher dimensions ( chronologically )  by r.  kenyon and a.  vershik @xcite , s.  le  borgne in his ph .",
    "d. thesis @xcite and subsequent works @xcite , k.  schmidt @xcite and finally by the author @xcite .",
    "we begin with the example that was studied in detail in 199192 and has eventually led to the theory described in the rest of the section .",
    "we are going to expose it just the way it appeared .",
    "the initial motivation has come from the theory of @xmath7-adic numbers : let @xmath7 be a prime , and @xmath420 denote the group of @xmath7-adic integers , i.e. , one - sided formal series in powers of @xmath7 : @xmath421 let @xmath422 denote the field of @xmath7-adic numbers , i.e. , @xmath423 thus , @xmath422 is the space of two - sided @xmath7-adic expansions finite to the right . finally ,",
    "if one considers the  full - scale \" two - sided @xmath7-adic expansions @xmath424 then we obtain the @xmath7-adic solenoid .    what will all the above objects become if one replaces @xmath7 by an algebraic unit @xmath2 and the full @xmath7-adic compactum  by the two - sided @xmath0-compactum @xmath65 ?",
    "the obvious candidate to start investigation seemed @xmath425 , in which case , we recall , @xmath426 is the set of two - sided 0 - 1 sequences without two consecutive 1 s ( see section  [ be ] ) .",
    "there is another good reason for considering the golden ratio .",
    "let @xmath427 be the fibonacci sequence ; as was explained in section  [ re ] , every natural number @xmath305 has a unique representation in base @xmath428 with the digits from @xmath429  see ( [ n= ] ) .",
    "furthermore , as we know , the profinite completion of ( [ n= ] ) turns @xmath430 into @xmath4 , whence the analog of @xmath420 is @xmath4 .",
    "this suggests that unlike the @xmath7-adic case , the _ fibadic _ case , as we will call it , produces the topology of the real line instead of the @xmath7-adic topology .",
    "recall also that the set of @xmath7-adic expansions as well as @xmath0-expansions finite to the * left * , is simply @xmath431 ( lemma  [ half ] ) .",
    "the situation with the spaces that involve _ formal _ power series in base @xmath0 ( infinite to the left ) is completely different and strongly depends on @xmath0 , as we will see below .    to deal with the problems regarding the formal power series",
    ", we notice that in the @xmath7-adic case the key to the structure of @xmath432 and @xmath433 is just the following relation : @xmath434 , where @xmath435 . in the fibadic case",
    "the analog of this relation is @xmath436 thus , for instance , the analog of @xmath422 is as follows : @xmath437 where the sequence @xmath438 satisfies ( [ fib ] ) .",
    "@xcite after identification of a countable number of certain pairs of sequences @xmath439 becomes a field isomorphic to @xmath440 .",
    "the pairs in question arise because , loosely speaking , unlike the @xmath7-adic case , where @xmath441 , in the fibadic pattern we have two different representations : @xmath442 .",
    "the pairwise identification in question thus concerns certain sequences that are finite to the left and cofinite to the right .",
    "a formal way to establish this fact given in @xcite is as follows : while the standard representation of the generators @xmath443 is @xmath444 , there is another one , namely @xmath445 .",
    "then @xmath446 , and it suffices to show that every real number does have a representation in base @xmath447 , and this representation is unique everywhere except a certain countable set .",
    "this claim follows from the results of section  [ re ] ( see ( [ n== ] ) ) .",
    "it is interesting to find out what will correspond to different subsets of @xmath440 in @xmath448 . since @xmath449 , and similarly , @xmath450 , etc . , it is easy to see that @xmath451 consists of finite sequences only . however , there are a lot of finite sequences that do not yield a natural number , for example , @xmath452 .",
    "moreover , it is shown in @xcite that if one takes the union of the finite sequences and the sequences that are finite to the right and cofinite to the left , then after the identification mentioned above , this set becomes naturally isomorphic to the ring @xmath453\\simeq { \\mathbb{z}}+{\\mathbb{z}}$ ] ( and the finite sequences are of course isomorphic to @xmath453\\cap{\\mathbb{r}}_+$ ] ) .",
    "this is again the crucial difference with the @xmath7-adic case , where the analogs are respectively @xmath454 and @xmath455 .",
    "more detailed results about the embedding of different subsets of @xmath431 into @xmath448 as well as about relations with finite automata can be found in @xcite .",
    "note also that by the theorem proven independently by a.  bertrand @xcite and k.  schmidt @xcite , @xmath456 is precisely the set of all sequences finite to the left and eventually periodic to the right ( this is very similar to the @xmath7-adic case and is true for all pisot numbers ) .",
    "the most important discovery made in @xcite was the fact that the fibadic analog of the solenoid @xmath433 is actually the 2-torus @xmath457 .",
    "let us explain this in detail as it appeared in subsequent works @xcite .",
    "let @xmath458 stand for the haar ( @xmath218 lebesgue ) measure on @xmath111 , and @xmath459 denote the _ fibonacci automorphism _ of @xmath8 , namely , the algebraic automorphism given by the matrix @xmath460 as is well known since the pioneering work by r.  l.  adler and b.  weiss @xcite , @xmath459 is metrically isomorphic to the two - sided @xmath0-shift @xmath21 .",
    "so , this is nothing new that @xmath448 as a set is essentially the torus ; what * is * new , however , is that the natural arithmetic of @xmath448 is the same as the natural arithmetic of @xmath8 .",
    "our goal is thus dual : to show that @xmath448 is indeed _ arithmetically _ isomorphic to the 2-torus ( i.e. , not only in the ergodic - theoretic sense but in the arithmetic sense as well ) and also to give a proof of the adler - weiss theorem cited above that reveals the arithmetic structure of @xmath65 .",
    "both problems will be discussed simultaneously .",
    "we denote by @xmath461 the set of all sequences from @xmath448 finite to the left ( recall that @xmath462 ) .",
    "consider @xmath11 and its greedy expansion @xmath463 given by ( [ 32-sided ] ) with @xmath464 for @xmath465 .",
    "consider now the map @xmath466 acting by the formula @xmath467 where @xmath468 denotes the fractional part of a number .",
    "let @xmath469 denote the image of @xmath461 under @xmath470 .",
    "since @xmath471 is an eigenvector of @xmath472 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath0 , the set @xmath473 is the half - leaf of the unstable foliation for the fibonacci automorphism passing through @xmath113 .",
    "hence @xmath474 for any @xmath475 finite to the left .",
    "since the set @xmath473 is dense in the 2-torus , as well as the set of sequences finite to the right is dense in @xmath448 , we can extend the relation  ( [ dense ] ) to the whole compactum @xmath448 , i.e. @xmath476 everywhere on @xmath448 .",
    "besides , @xmath470 is surjective and can be written in a very  arithmetic \" sort of way , namely @xmath477 where the expression @xmath478 means that @xmath479 .",
    "the number - theoretic reason why these series do converge modulo 1 is that @xmath0 is a pisot number , whence @xmath480 as an exponential rate .",
    "@xcite the map @xmath470 semiconjugates the automorphisms @xmath481 and @xmath482 , where @xmath115 denotes the ( markov ) measure of maximal entropy for @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , after an identification on @xmath448 that concerns a set of sequences of zero measure , @xmath448 becomes an additive group @xmath483 , and @xmath470 becomes a group homomorphism of @xmath483 and @xmath8 .",
    "thus , we seemed to have succeeded in our attempt to insert the arithmetic compactum @xmath448 into @xmath8 .",
    "however , this is not that simple ; the issue with @xmath470 is that it is * not * bijective a.e . and",
    "thus can not be regarded as an actual isomorphism .",
    "in fact , in @xcite it was shown that it is 5-to-1 a.e .- a.e .",
    "@xmath484 has exactly 5 @xmath470-preimages .",
    "] this is not a coincidence  in section  [ pa ] we will see that the discriminant of an irrational in question plays an important role in this theory ( see proposition  [ nnp ] ) . the deep reason why @xmath470 has failed is because of the wrong choice of a homoclinic point ",
    "see below .",
    "the way to construct an actual isomorphism is a slight modification of @xmath470 .",
    "namely , let @xmath485 be defined by the formula @xmath486 similarly to the above , the convergence of both series is a consequence of the fact that @xmath487 .",
    "@xcite the map @xmath488 is 1-to-1 a.e .",
    "it is both a metric isomorphism of the automorphisms @xmath481 and @xmath489 and of the groups @xmath483 and @xmath8 .",
    "the question is , why @xmath488 succeeded where @xmath470 failed ?",
    "the reason becomes more transparent if we rewrite both maps .",
    "to do so , we need to recall some basic notions and facts from hyperbolic dynamics .",
    "let @xmath10 be a hyperbolic automorphism of the torus @xmath490 , @xmath491 and @xmath492 denote respectively the leaves of the stable and unstable foliations passing through @xmath113 . recall that a point homoclinic to @xmath113 ( or simply a _ homoclinic point _ ) is a point which belongs to @xmath493 .",
    "in other words , @xmath494 is homoclinic iff @xmath495 as @xmath496 .",
    "the homoclinic points are a group under addition isomorphic to @xmath497 , and we will denote it by @xmath498 .",
    "each homoclinic point @xmath494 can be obtained as follows : take some @xmath499 and project it onto @xmath492 along @xmath491 and then onto @xmath500 by taking the fractional parts of all coordinates of the vector ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we claim that both ( [ fbe ] ) and ( [ fbe ] ) can be written in the form @xmath501 where @xmath502 and @xmath503 in the case of @xmath470 and @xmath504 in the case of @xmath488 .",
    "the reason why @xmath505 is  better \" than @xmath506 is because it is a _",

    ", @xmath494 is fundamental iff @xmath509 for some @xmath222 . in the next subsection",
    "we will have a generalization of this fact .",
    "the next step was made by the author and a.  vershik in @xcite  it concerned the general case of dimension  2 . in this paper",
    "however we will jump to the next stage , which will completely cover the two - dimensional case , namely to the hyperbolic automorphisms of the @xmath115-torus ( @xmath510 ) whose stable ( unstable ) foliation is one - dimensional .",
    "let @xmath10 be an algebraic automorphism of the torus @xmath111 given by a matrix @xmath511 with the following property : the characteristic polynomial for @xmath512 is irreducible over @xmath513 , and a pisot number @xmath2 is one of its roots ( we recall that an algebraic integer is called _ a pisot number _",

    "the model explained above looks rather natural , explicit and canonical . what can be done in case when at least two eigenvalues are outside the unit disc and at least two  inside it ?",
    "the main difficulty here lies in the fact that unlike the pisot case , where the entropy is @xmath48 and the @xmath0-compactum is the obvious candidate for a coding space , in the general case this choice is not at all obvious .",
    "there are several constructions that cover the general hyperbolic ( or even ergodic ) case , and each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages .",
    "before we describe all of them in detail , let us try to understand what is that we actually want from an arithmetic coding .",
    "obviously , there are no new properties of algebraic toral automorphisms that can be revealed this way  simply because they all are so well known .",
    "what then ?",
    "the unclear situation with this has , in my opinion , led to a certain impasse in this theory .",
    "no model seems to be canonical , and until we find an appropriate application , any theory will be a @xmath575-@xmath576-@xmath577 .",
    "let us also note that there are two main challenges any general arithmetic encoding has to meet :    1 .",
    "it has to be bounded - to - one and , if possible , one - to - one a.e . ; 2 .",
    "the alphabet - it should be as simple as possible ( preferably integers ) .",
    "which one is more important ( if one can not achieve both aims ) ? here",
    "is one possible application that might measure the value of different constructions .",
    "we have already mentioned the theorem on maps with holes proven by s.  bundfuss , t.  krueger and s.  troubetzkoy in @xcite ( see section  [ un ] ) . recall that this theorem claims that a if one cuts out a  typical \" parallelepiped from @xmath111 along the directions of the stable and unstable foliations with a vertex at @xmath113 and the sides of length @xmath114 , then the corresponding exclusion map will be a subshift of finite type .",
    "this nice result however does not give any conditions on @xmath578 for this subshift to be * nondegenerate*. at the same time , it is possible to show that if @xmath578 are very small , then its entropy will be positive , and it is obvious that for  large \" @xmath578 the images of the hole will cover the whole torus , so it will be degenerate .",
    "thus , if we make a natural assumption that similarly to the one - dimensional case , the entropy of the exclusion subshift is a continuous function of @xmath116 , then there exists a threshold similar to the komornik - loreti constant for the map @xmath118 ( see section  [ un ] ) . in other words , we will have the surface @xmath579 in the space @xmath116 , underneath which the entropy of the exclusion subshift parameterized by @xmath580 is positive , and it is zero above @xmath579 .",
    "we do not know how the surface @xmath581 looks like even in the case of the fibonacci automorphism ( where it in fact must be a curve ) .",
    "nonetheless , we believe the exact simple formula for the symbolic encoding like ( [ homo ] ) with an explicitly described symbolic compactum will probably help to reformulate the problem in terms symbolic sequences and to treat it in a way similar to the one described in @xcite . in particular , let us ask the following question : is there any multidimensional analog of the thue - morse sequence ( cf . section  [ be ] ) ?    for this problem",
