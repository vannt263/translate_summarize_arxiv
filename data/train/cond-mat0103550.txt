    "superconductivity has the nature of quantum condensation in a macroscopic scale , which can be described by a wavefunction with phase factor @xmath12 .",
    "when two superconductors are weak linked , the phase difference will manifest in the dc josephson current , with the current - phase relation @xmath13 .",
    "if the weak link area is controlled by certain external conditions , the magnitude of the critical current @xmath14 may be either suppressed @xcite or enhanced @xcite . in some occasions ,",
    "even the sign of @xmath14 may be reversed @xcite , or equivalently the phase factor @xmath15 changes to @xmath16 , referred to as the @xmath0-junction transition .",
    "one of the simplest example is the so - called superconducting quantum diffraction , in which a superconductor / insulator / superconductor tunnel junction is tuned by an external magnetic field .",

    "unfortunately , the @xmath0-junction transition can not be directly detected in the two terminal tunnel junction because the current source is used in the measurement to control supercurrent rather than phase difference .",
    "however , in a mesoscopic superconductor / normal - metal / superconductor ( sns ) junction with the n - region coupled to normal electrode(s ) @xcite , the phase difference can be determined independently by the coherent andreev reflection current which is proportional to @xmath20 $ ] .",

    "bound states are formed in the n  region , each state carries positive or negative supercurrent . for diffusive sns junctions ,",
    "the so - called current carrying density of states ( ccdos ) plays the similar role , which also has positive and negative contributions to the supercurrent .",
    "recent experiment @xcite demonstrated the @xmath0-junction transition in the diffusive sns junction by applying control voltage on the n - region .",
    "in fact , the biased normal reservoirs across mesoscopic n  region induce a non - equilibrium distribution in the n - region , and make the occupied fraction of ccdos deviating from the equilibrium one . when the control voltage is excess a certain value , the non - equilibrium distribution has so much weight on the negative part of ccdos that the total current reverses its sign .",
    "many theoretical works have been addressed on this issue , either for ballistic sns junctions @xcite , or for diffusive sns junctions @xcite .",

    "therefore , the negative continuous spectrum of @xmath152 is dominant in the supercurrent , leading to the @xmath0-junction transition on both sides of the positive peak .",
    "in this work , we have investigated different mechanisms for the @xmath0-junction transition in s - qd - s system . from the current formula @xmath210",
    ", one can see that the @xmath37-junction transition may originate from the change of ccdos @xmath86 , or the change of the distribution function @xmath198 , or from the changes of both .",
    "the two mechanisms discussed in sections ii and iii , the zeeman splitting and intra - dot interaction , are involved the change of ccdos @xmath86 only .",
    "these two mechanisms are closely connected since the intra - dot interaction may induce magnetization in qd if the interaction is strong enough .",
    "the third mechanism studied in section iv involves the change of the distribution function in qd , and the interplay of the magnetization with the non - equilibrium distribution in qd .",
    "it is interesting that the change of ccdos and the change of distribution have the similar effect on the @xmath0-junction transition , where the positive and negative andreev bound states cancels each other , leaving the negative continuous spectrum dominant in the supercurrent .",
    "the interplay of the two mechanisms lead to the novel effect that the supercurrent suppressed by magnetization of the qd can be partially recovered by a proper non - equilibrium distribution of electrons in the qd .",
