    "hydrodynamically mediated interactions between elastic surfaces is a widely researched topic that has applications in engineering , biophysics , and geophysics .",
    "such studies include collisions between suspended elastic particles @xcite , interactions of suspended objects with walls @xcite and polymer - bearing surfaces @xcite . often , the salient coupling between elasticity and flow is most effective when surfaces are in near - contact , allowing the well - developed literature on lubrication flows @xcite to be utilized to include elastic effects .",
    "a well known consequence of the reversibility of stokes flows is that a rigid symmetric object such a sphere or a cylinder that translates parallel to a rigid wall at zero reynolds number experiences no hydrodynamic force normal to the wall .",
    "however , if either surface is soft , the parallel translation of such an object induces stresses in the fluid that deform the surfaces .",
    "the surface deformation breaks symmetry and drives a secondary stokes flow that can produce a lift force on the object @xcite .",
    "thus , a rigid sphere or cylinder that moves due to the application of an external force parallel to a soft wall must translate with a non - zero component of its velocity normal to the wall in order to remain free of net force .",
    "such elastically driven motion has been observed experimentally and described theoretically in a number of different configurations @xcite .",
    "the literature has largely focused on effect of boundary elasticity on the translation of a rigid object in the flow @xcite .",
    "recent experiments @xcite measuring the effects of elasticity of a rigid cylinder sliding parallel to a soft wall , however , also noted a rotation of the cylinder .",
    "existing theories , which are accurate to leading order in the deformation of the elastic wall , do not predict an effect of elasticity on the rotation of an object translating parallel to a soft wall at steady state @xcite .    in this article , we develop an asymptotic analysis to higher order in the deformation of the wall and show that the coupling between fluid flow and elastic deformation induces a rotation of a nearby rigid object . focusing on the case of a cylinder sliding parallel to a soft elastic layer",
    ", we use the lorentz reciprocal theorem along with previously known results @xcite to show formally that a torque - free translating cylinder rotates at quadratic order in the deformation of the layer .",
    "consequently , we infer that an infinite cylinder that slides parallel to a soft wall without rotating can only do so under an externally applied torque that balances the elastohydrodynamic torque . after first deriving a general expression for the angular velocity in terms of the sliding speed , the radius of the cylinder and the deformation of the wall , we apply our result to the rotation of a cylinder free - falling under gravity near a soft - coated incline @xcite .",
    "we compare the theoretical predictions with direct experimental measurements , and then develop symmetry arguments that are generally applicable to systems with deformable boundaries .",
    "we consider the motion of a long cylinder of radius @xmath0 in a viscous fluid of density @xmath1 and viscosity @xmath2 .",
    "the cylinder translates and rotates near a wall , as shown in figure [ figsetup ] , under the action of an external force .",
    "the wall comprises a rigid substrate coated with a soft elastic layer of thickness @xmath3 , with shear and bulk moduli @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the motion of the cylinder occurs in such a way that its axis remains tangent to the plane wall at all times .",
    "the smallest separation distance between the surface of the cylinder and the nominally flat ( undeformed ) position of the soft layer is denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "we restrict our attention to two - dimensional motion in the @xmath7 plane , so that the cylinder s translational velocity can be written as @xmath8 , and its angular velocity as @xmath9 , as indicated in figure [ figsetup ] .",
    "the steady motion of the cylinder drives a fluid flow @xmath10 and an associated stress field @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the pressure field .",
    "if the reynolds number is small , the flow is described by the continuity and stokes equations    [ stokesflow ] @xmath13        the stresses due to the flow deform the soft wall ; we denote this deformation by @xmath14 , using the convention that @xmath15 is negative under compression .",
    "if the inertia of the soft material is negligible , the elastic wall responds instantaneously to the stresses applied on it by the flow .",
    "since the flow is quasi - steady in the stokes flow limit , both the fluid stress and the deformation of the elastic layer only depend on the instantaneous position and velocity of the cylinder , but not on its acceleration .",
    "it then is convenient to work in a frame of reference that translates with the velocity @xmath16 of the cylinder , and whose origin at some time @xmath17 is at the point on the undeformed position of the wall closest to the surface of the cylinder ( see figure [ figsetup ] ) . in these coordinates ,",
    "the wall is located at @xmath18 , and the axis of the cylinder at @xmath19 .    in the translating reference frame ,",
    "the time dependence of the wall deformation occurs only through the separation distance @xmath20 , allowing us to write @xmath21 .",
    "we observe that a perfectly rigid wall translates with velocity @xmath22 as measured in the translating reference frame .",
    "thus , the kinematic condition at the deformed wall can be expressed as @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the position of the deformed wall , @xmath25 denotes the material time derivative , and we have used the chain rule to write @xmath26 . observing that the no - slip condition at the wall is @xmath27 , and that @xmath28 by definition , the boundary conditions for the flow are    [ eq : bc ] @xmath29    where @xmath30 isf a position vector relative to the center of the cylinder ( see figure  [ figsetup ] ) and @xmath31 represents the surface of the cylinder .",
    "the condition ( [ eq : bc]a ) is a statement of no slip on the cylinder in the translating reference frame .    to complete the description of the problem ,",
    "it is necessary to specify the relation between the fluid stresses and the wall deformation . here , we assume that the elastic response is given by the winkler approximation , in which the deformation @xmath15 of the soft layer is proportional to the normal stress applied on it @xcite .",
    "we assume that the deformation of the soft layer is small compared with its thickness , itself much smaller than the characteristic length scale @xmath32 of the stress field along the wall ( i.e. @xmath33 ) . in this limit ,",
    "we may write @xmath34 which is formally valid when @xmath35 .    we henceforth restrict ourselves to the lubrication limit ( @xmath36 ) in which @xmath37 is the characteristic size of the non - conforming contact region @xcite . the elastohydrodynamic lift force on a sliding cylinder arising from the deformation of the wall in this limit",
    "is known in a number of different situations @xcite .",
    "the effect of elasticity on the rotation of the cylinder has , however , not been quantified systematically , although it was observed in recent experiments @xcite . here",
    ", we focus on quantifying the rotation rate of a torque - free cylinder sliding parallel to a soft wall in the limit of small deformations .      before developing a detailed theory , we first present scaling arguments for the rotation rate . in the lubrication limit ,",
    "the normal stress is dominated by the pressure of the flow in the lubrication layer , so that @xmath38 .",
    "the order of magnitude of the deformation of the soft layer can be estimated using ( [ stokesflow ] ) and ( [ delta ] ) as @xmath39 .",
    "this deformation scale relative to the width of the lubrication layer @xmath40 is quantified by the dimensionless parameter @xmath41 , which is defined as @xmath42 thus , @xmath41 can be interpreted as a dimensionless compliance of the elastic layer and by definition represents the scale of its deformation relative to the lubrication gap width , i.e. @xmath43 .    for small deformations @xmath44 , the lift force per unit length on a cylinder sliding parallel to a soft wall is approximately @xmath45 @xcite . it has been shown that a sliding cylinder experiences zero torque to leading order in @xmath41 , and therefore , a cylinder free of external torque is predicted to not rotate under steady state sliding @xcite .",
    "we estimate the rotation rate of a torque - free sliding cylinder by interpreting the zero net torque on the cylinder as a superposition of equal and opposite contributions due to translation and rotation . since the lubrication gap in between the cylinder and the deformed soft wall has thickness @xmath46 , the torque per unit length on a purely sliding cylinder scales nominally as @xmath47 . using a taylor series expansion in @xmath48 ( small deformations ) and invoking the result that a sliding cylinder experiences no torque up to @xmath49 @xcite , we conclude that the leading - order elastohydrodynamic torque ( per unit length ) due to sliding must scale as @xmath50 . on the other hand ,",
    "the torque per unit length on a purely rotating cylinder for small wall - deformations is @xmath51 .",
    "balancing the two contributions , recognizing that @xmath52 , and using results in the scaling relation @xmath53 therefore , the rotation of the cylinder is expected to occur at @xmath54 , in contrast with the lift force , which depends linearly on @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "we quantify this rotational scaling formally in the sections below by a systematic application of the lorentz reciprocal theorem for stokes flow .",
    "we then apply our general result to the the case of buoyancy - driven motion of a cylinder near an inclined wall coated with a soft layer , and compare the theoretical predictions to experimental measurements .",
    "first , we develop a reciprocal relation for the angular velocity of a torque - free cylinder , generally valid for a weakly deformable wall .",
    "while the focus of this paper is on the elastic deformations that are described by the winkler approximation and the lubrication limit @xmath36 , the methodology described below is generally applicable to flow problems involving boundary deformations that are small relative to the smallest geometric length scale .    for small deformations @xmath55 ,",
    "it is appropriate to express the no - slip condition ( [ eq : bc]b ) on the deformed wall @xmath24 by a perturbation of the domain about the undeformed position of the wall , see e.g. @xcite . writing @xmath56 in ( [ eq : bc]b ) using a taylor expansion about @xmath57 , we obtain the equivalent condition @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the _ undeformed _ wall position @xmath57 . to utilize the reciprocal theorem for stokes flows , we introduce as a model problem the flow due to a cylinder rotating about its axis with angular velocity @xmath60 near a rigid wall at @xmath57 .",
    "the model velocity field , denoted by @xmath61 , satisfies the no - slip conditions @xmath62 on the cylinder and @xmath63 on @xmath57 .",
    "we have therefore defined both the main and model problems on the undeformed domain .",

    "we summarize here the well - known solution to the model flow driven by a cylinder rotating near a rigid plane wall with angular velocity @xmath77 under the lubrication approximation @xmath36 @xcite . on introducing the dimensionless variables @xmath78 the shape of the cylinder in the lubrication layer is locally described by the parabolic profile @xmath79 , where @xmath80 represents the position along the wall closest to the surface of the cylinder .",
    "the solution to the model problem is    [ model ] @xmath81    from which follow    [ dudz_model ] @xmath82    which are useful in subsequent calculations .",
    "the dimensional surface traction @xmath83 at the wall , which appears in , is therefore @xmath84 the dimensional hydrodynamic torque per unit length of the cylinder is then @xmath85 where the negative sign indicates that the hydrodynamic torque opposes the rotation @xcite .",

    "since we only consider constant @xmath40 , we henceforth suppress the dependence of @xmath15 on @xmath40 and write @xmath89 .",
    "this situation is relevant to the steady state motion of the cylinder free - falling near a soft incline under gravity @xcite and is discussed in more detail in subsequent sections . before evaluating the integrals in to compute @xmath90 , we give the known solution @xcite to the flow up to @xmath91 .",
    "we define dimensionless flow variables for the main problem ( similar to definitions relevant to the model problem ) as @xmath92 and introduce a dimensionless velocity vector @xmath93 the dimensionless deformation of the wall can be written using and as @xmath94 where @xmath41 , defined in , is the dimensionless compliance of the soft material , and we have used the simplification that the normal stress is dominated by pressure in the lubrication limit .",

    "the softness of the wall therefore causes the cylinder to rotate with angular velocity quadratic in the dimensionless compliance @xmath41 .",

    ". this feature may be in part due to the treatment of the elastic layer as compressible ( the winkler approximation ) , although the predictions of such a model for the sliding speed agree well with earlier measurements @xcite .",
    "we develop scaling arguments for the rotation of an infinite cylinder near a perfectly incompressible elastic layer @xmath220 in section [ sec : incomp ] , which differ in details from the present theory , but are otherwise qualitatively similar .",
    "we find that the incompressible scaling laws yield only a partial improvement over the present theory .",
    "we briefly discuss some general geometrical features of the problem for wall - parallel steady translation of a torque - free cylinder ( @xmath221 .",
    "first , we note that for translation parallel to a rigid wall , a torque - free cylinder does not rotate at all .",
    "this is a nontrivial but well known result that applies only to infinite cylinders , but not more generally to compact objects such as spheres @xcite .",
    "translation of the cylinder parallel to the wall drives a flow through the gap , which at @xmath222 corresponds to an antisymmetric pressure distribution about the symmetry plane @xmath80 .",
    "this pressure distribution results in an antisymmetric deformation of the interface at @xmath91 @xcite . the @xmath91 flow has the opposite symmetry , i.e. it corresponds to a symmetric pressure distribution @xmath223 , which is ultimately responsible for the elastohydrodynamic lift force exerted on the cylinder . by the same token , the shear stress in the fluid at @xmath91 has the opposite ( odd ) symmetry about @xmath80 and therefore can not produce any torque on the cylinder .    at next order ,",
    "the symmetries of the pressure and shear stresses become reversed yet again .",
    "the pressure of the @xmath91 flow creates a symmetric deformation of the wall at @xmath54 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath54 flow is characterized by an antisymmetric pressure distribution @xmath224 , and a symmetric shear stress distribution on the surface of the cylinder , about the @xmath80 plane .",
    "the @xmath54 problem thus realizes the symmetry required to produce an elastohydrodynamic torque on a purely sliding cylinder .",
    "we remark that additional corrections to the drag are expected at @xmath54 due to the same reasons of symmetry , but no additional lift force is produced on the cylinder at this order .",
    "the full solution to the @xmath54 problem is given in appendix [ app ] , in which we compute both the drag force correction as well as provide an alternative method to compute the angular velocity @xmath90 .",
    "the reciprocal theorem is then used again in appendix [ app : liftforce ] to compute the @xmath225 correction to the elastohydrodynamic lift force .    as a general rule for a symmetric object translating parallel to a wall in the small - deformation limit , lift forces",
    "can only be expected to occur with odd powers of @xmath41 , and torques and drag forces to occur with even powers of @xmath41 .",
    "the case of the sliding cylinder is further specialized due to the vanishing torque at @xmath222 , which causes the leading - order torque to be effective at @xmath54 . by a similar line of argument",
    ", the problem in which the cylinder translates perpendicular to the wall ( @xmath226 , @xmath227 ) has the opposite symmetry .    by a similar application of the reciprocal theorem as in section [ sec : recip ]",
    ", we compute the elastohydrodynamic lift force on a sliding torque - free cylinder as ( see appendix [ app : liftforce ] ) @xmath228 the term in proportional to @xmath41 is the leading - order result that is well known @xcite , but is obtained here by the use of reciprocal theorem .",
    "the @xmath225 correction to the lift force utilizes the solution of the lubrication flow accurate to @xmath54 , which is given in appendix [ app ] , where we also calculate the elastohydrodynamic correction to the drag on the cylinder and obtain @xmath229      the symmetry arguments are applicable to other systems involving small deformations of boundaries .",
    "as a concrete example relevant to the present study , we consider the situation in which the soft thin layer is incompressible ( @xmath230 , and develop scaling relations for the angular velocity as a function of the sliding speed .",
    "if the layer is incompressible , its normal and tangential deformations are coupled in such a way as to conserve the volume of the elastic material .",
    "incompressibility of the thin elastic layer ( we assume @xmath231 ) requires that @xmath232 . here",
    ", @xmath233 is the scale of elastic deformation in the @xmath234direction ( parallel to the sliding ) and @xmath235 is the deformation normal to the wall ; the prime indicates incompressibility of the elastic layer .",
    "the stress equations in the thin elastic layer are lubrication - like , i.e. the pressure in the elastic solid scales as @xmath236",
    ". the elastic pressure must be in balance with the pressure in the fluid @xmath237 to keep the fluid - solid interface in quasi - static equilibrium .",
    "this balance of pressures @xmath238 yields @xcite @xmath239 the dimensionless compliance ( deformation scale relative to the lubrication layer thickness ) is therefore @xmath240 following the discussion on symmetry in section [ sec : symmetry ] , we generically expect @xmath241 for an infinite cylinder .    for a cylinder sedimenting due to buoyancy near an incline coated with a thin incompressible elastic layer , the balance of hydrodynamic forces and the cylinder s net weight is @xmath125 ( tangent to the incline ) , and @xmath242 ( normal to the incline ) , which now results in @xmath243 the rotation rate is then @xmath244    the dependence of @xmath90 with @xmath4 for an incompressible material is weaker @xmath245 compared with the prediction with the winkler approximation ( @xmath191 , see equation [ omegagravitydim ] ) , and agrees better with the data in figure [ fig : raw](a ) .",
    "however , the data in figure [ figmaster ] does not seem to collapse with @xmath246 as it does with @xmath41 .",
    "thus , it would appear that the present experiments exhibit some features of both elastic models , although the source of such behavior is unclear at present .",
    "using the lorentz reciprocal theorem for stokes flows , we have shown in the lubrication limit that an infinite cylinder sliding parallel to a soft wall without rotation experiences an elastohydrodynamic torque in addition to the well - known elastohydrodynamic lift force .",
    "the induced torque is quadratic in the deformation @xmath15 of the wall , while the lift force scales linearly with deformation .",
    "thus , we find that a cylinder free of external torque sliding parallel to a soft wall rotates with a non - zero angular velocity in the same sense as expected in classical rolling .",
    "the angular velocity @xmath90 scales as the cube of the sliding speed and the square of the viscosity , and increases with the softness of the elastic layer .",
    "the general results of the theory compare reasonably against experiments of an immersed cylinder free - falling and rotating under gravity near an inclined soft - coated wall , albeit with some quantitative differences for a certain range of compliances .",
    "we ascribe the differences to ( i ) the torque produced by three - dimensional flows near the ends of the finite - length cylinder , which dominates the rotation of the cylinder for relatively stiff layers , and ( ii ) the possible incompressibility of the elastic layer .",
    "the geometric structure of the problem results in symmetry arguments pertaining to the motion of symmetrical objects such as cylinders or spheres near weakly deformable boundaries .",
    "these general arguments are likely to be useful in hydrodynamically mediated interactions between soft elastic surfaces , which are important features of some biological and geophysical systems .",

    "we develop a perturbation solution of the form @xmath263 note that we have also expanded @xmath259 , since it is determined automatically by the condition of zero torque . at @xmath222 ,",
    "we find from that @xmath264 which has the solution @xmath265 the zero - torque condition then yields @xmath266    at @xmath91 , it follows from that the equation for the pressure is @xmath267 which has the solution @xmath268 the zero - torque condition again results in @xmath269 as recognized by @xcite .",
    "the equation for the pressure at @xmath54 is @xmath270 which has the solution ( obtained using _ mathematica _ ) @xmath271 the zero - torque condition is now @xmath272 thus , we find that a torque - free infinite cylinder sliding parallel to a soft plane therefore has a rotation speed that is given at leading order by @xmath273 which is identical to the result obtained in using the reciprocal theorem .",
    "we also compute the @xmath54 correction to the hydrodynamic drag force . the hydrodynamic drag force per unit length of the cylinder , is given by @xmath274 , where @xmath70 is the normal to the surface of the cylinder directed into the fluid . in the lubrication limit , the above expression reduces to @xmath275 using the expansions of @xmath276 and @xmath256 in powers of @xmath41 , we obtain @xmath229 we note that @xmath277 independent of the value of @xmath278 and that the elasticity of the layer lowers the drag on the cylinder .    the perturbation analysis may , in principle , be carried forward to higher order in @xmath41 , although the solutions for the pressure distribution @xmath279 become increasingly unwieldy with increasing powers of @xmath41 .",
