    "numerous precision tests of the standard model ( sm ) and searches for its possible violation have been performed in the last few decades , serving as an invaluable tool to test the theory at the quantum level .",
    "they have also provided stringent constraints on many `` new physics '' ( np ) scenarios .",
    "a typical example is given by the measurements of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron and the muon , where recent experiments reached the fabulous relative precision of 0.7 ppb  @xcite and 0.5 ppm,@xcite respectively .",
    "these experiments measure the so - called gyromagnetic factor @xmath1 , defined by the relation between the particle s spin @xmath5 and its magnetic moment @xmath6 , = g , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the charge and mass of the particle . in the dirac theory of a charged point - like spin-@xmath9 particle , @xmath10 .",
    "quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) predicts deviations from dirac s value , as the charged particle can emit and reabsorb virtual photons .",
    "these qed effects slightly increase the @xmath1 value .",
    "it is conventional to express the difference of @xmath1 from 2 in terms of the value of the so - called anomalous magnetic moment , a dimensionless quantity defined as @xmath11 .",
    "the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron , @xmath12 , is rather insensitive to strong and weak interactions , hence providing a stringent test of qed and leading to the most precise determination of the fine - structure constant @xmath13 to date.@xcite on the other hand , the @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 of the muon , @xmath14 , allows to test the entire sm , as each of its sectors contributes in a significant way to the total prediction .",
    "compared with @xmath12 , @xmath14 is also much better suited to unveil or constrain np effects .",
    "indeed , for a lepton @xmath15 , their contribution to @xmath16 is generally expected to be proportional to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the mass of the lepton and @xmath19 is the scale of np , thus leading to an @xmath20 relative enhancement of the sensitivity of the muon versus the electron anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "this more than compensates the much higher accuracy with which the @xmath1 factor of the latter is known .",
    "the anomalous magnetic moment of the @xmath0 lepton , @xmath21 , would suit even better ; however , its direct experimental measurement is prevented by the relatively short lifetime of this lepton , at least at present .",
    "the existing limits are based on the precise measurements of the total and differential cross sections of the reactions @xmath22 and @xmath23 at lep energies",
    ". the most stringent limit , @xmath24 at 95% confidence level , was set by the delphi collaboration,@xcite and is still more than an order of magnitude worse than that required to determine @xmath21 .    in the 1990s",
    "it became clear that the accuracy of the theoretical prediction of the muon @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 , challenged by the e821 experiment underway at brookhaven,@xcite was going to be restricted by our knowledge of its hadronic contribution .",
    "this problem has been solved by the impressive experiments at low - energy @xmath25 colliders , where the total hadronic cross section ( as well as exclusive ones ) were measured with high precision , allowing a significant improvement of the uncertainty of the leading - order hadronic contribution.@xcite as a result , the accuracy of the sm prediction for @xmath14 now matches that of its measurement . in parallel to these efforts ,",
    "very many improvements of all other sectors of the sm prediction were carried on by a large number of theorists ( see refs .   for reviews ) .",
    "all these experimental and theoretical developments allow to significantly improve the theoretical prediction for the anomalous magnetic moment of @xmath0 lepton as well .",
    "in this article we review and update the sm prediction of @xmath21 , analyzing in detail the three contributions into which it is usually split : qed , electroweak ( ew ) and hadronic .",

    "similarly to the case of the muon @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 , this term can not be directly determined via a dispersion relation approach using data ( unlike the leading - order hadronic contribution ) , and its evaluation therefore relies on specific models of low - energy hadronic interactions with electromagnetic currents . actually , very few estimates of @xmath183 exist in the literature,@xcite and all of them were obtained simply rescaling the muon results @xmath184 by a factor @xmath180 . following this very nave procedure , the @xmath185 estimate varies between @xmath186\\times ( m_{\\tau}^2/m_{\\mu}^2)= 23(11)\\times 10^{-8 } $ ] , and @xmath187\\times ( m_{\\tau}^2/m_{\\mu}^2)= 38(7)\\times 10^{-8 } $ ] , according to the values chosen for @xmath188 from refs .   and , respectively .",

    "[ sec : sm ] to the available experimental bounds on the @xmath0 lepton anomaly .    as we already mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "quite generally , np associated with a scale @xmath19 is expected to modify the sm prediction of the anomalous magnetic moment of a lepton @xmath15 of mass @xmath18 by a contribution @xmath206 .",
    "therefore , given the large factor @xmath207 , the @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 of the @xmath0 lepton is much more sensitive than the muon one to ew and np loop effects that give contributions @xmath208 , making its measurement an excellent opportunity to unveil ( or just constrain ) np effects .",
    "another interesting feature can be observed comparing the magnitude of the ew and hadronic contributions to the muon and @xmath0 lepton @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 .",
    "the ew contribution to the @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 of the @xmath0 is only a factor of seven smaller than the hadronic one , compared to a factor of 45 for the @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 of the muon",
    ". also , while the ew contribution to @xmath209 is only a factor of three larger than the present uncertainty of the hadronic contribution , this factor raises to 10 for the @xmath0 lepton .",
    "if a np contribution were of the same order of magnitude as the ew one , from a purely theoretical point of view , the @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 of the @xmath0 would provide a much cleaner test of the presence ( or absence ) of such np effects than the muon one .",
    "indeed , if this were the case , such a np contribution to the @xmath0 lepton @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 would be much larger than the hadronic uncertainty , which is currently the limiting factor of the sm prediction .",
    "unfortunately , the very short lifetime of the @xmath0 lepton makes it very difficult to determine its anomalous magnetic moment by measuring its spin precession in the magnetic field , like in the muon @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 experiment.@xcite instead , experiments focused on high - precision measurements of the @xmath0 lepton pair production in various high - energy processes , comparing the measured cross sections with the qed predictions.@xcite as we can see from , the sensitivity of the best existing measurements is still more than an order of magnitude worse than that required to determine @xmath21 .    nonetheless , the possibility to improve such a measurement is certainly not excluded .",
    "for example , it was suggested to determine the @xmath0 lepton @xmath1 factor taking advantage of the radiation amplitude zero which occurs at the high - energy end of the lepton distribution in radiative @xmath0 decays.@xcite this method requires a very good energy resolution and could perhaps be employed at a @xmath0-charm or @xmath210 factory also benefiting from the possibility to collect very high statistics .",
    "it is not clear whether the huge data samples at @xmath210 factories will result in a corresponding gain for the limits on @xmath21 .",
    "indeed , lep measurements were rather limited by systematic uncertainties , which were of the order of 2 - 3% for the discussed processes and , until now , experiments at @xmath210 factories have not yet reached such a level of accuracy in the absolute measurements of the total cross sections . however , a search for the @xmath0 lepton electric dipole moment at belle@xcite showed that with the appropriate choice of observables , using full information about events , the improvement in sensitivity can be proportional to the square root of luminosity , i.e. , determined mainly by statistics .",
    "one can hope that this is also the case with the determination of @xmath21 .",
    "a similar method to study @xmath21 using radiative @xmath86 decays and potentially very high data samples at lhc was suggested in ref .  .",
    "yet another method would use the channeling in a bent crystal similarly to the suggestion for the measurement of magnetic moments of short - living baryons.@xcite this method has been successfully tested by the e761 collaboration at fermilab , which measured the magnetic moment of the @xmath211 hyperon.@xcite in the case of the @xmath0 lepton , it was suggested to use the decay @xmath212 , which would produce polarized @xmath0 leptons.@xcite in 1991 , when this suggestion was published , the idea seemed completely unlikely .",
    "however , in the era of @xmath210 factories , when the decay @xmath212 is already observed by the belle collaboration,@xcite and the possibility of a super-@xmath210 factory is actively discussed , this is no longer a dream .",
    "even more promising could be the realization of this idea in a dedicated experiment at a hadron collider with its huge number of @xmath210 mesons produced and a more suitable geometry .",
    "we believe that a detailed feasibility study of such an experiment , as well as further attempts to improve the accuracy of the theoretical prediction for @xmath21 , are quite timely .",
