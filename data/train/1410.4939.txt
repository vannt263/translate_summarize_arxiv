    "when the number of turn becomes large , the relation reduce to that in of a straight string . however , when @xmath2 is small , we see the scaling of the spatial frequencies . in the case of linear string",
    ", the dispersion relation leads to the conventional relation @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is wavelength , @xmath27 is frequency and @xmath28 is the speed of the wave . in spiral geometry , this relation needs to be corrected by a geometric factor as given by eq .",

    "]    the wave equation on the spiral , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : requation ] ) , is the well known bessel differential equation .",

    "spiral geometry offers interesting solutions to the wave equation with various physically important boundary conditions .",
    "further interesting solutions maybe obtained by using different densities along the string , as is known for the case of indian drums @xcite .",
    "the connection between 2-d circular and 1-d spiral is important as wave equation in circular geometry is well understood and one can apply some of the implications immediately to the spiral geometry .",
    "similarities between circular drum head and spiral string is indeed a useful result since the entire membrane can be replaced by a 1-d spring giving the same vibration modes .",
    "this can come handy since the material required to create a membrane can be done with by using the spiral .",
    "the more general case may be dealt by transforming from cartesian coordinates to a coordinate system where constant curves are spirals @xcite .",
    "the solutions of 2-d wave equation in such a system can also be given in terms of bessel functions , which will be discussed else where .",
    "since analytic solutions are available , otherwise complete numerical analysis can be avoided for the applications such as vibration isolator with spiral / helical suspension .",
    "one the important application under consideration is the wave propagation in the basilar membrane of mammals .",
    "it has already been shown that , the spiral geometry of inner ears of mammals has important implications @xcite , this may be further extended using results from spiral coordinates ."
