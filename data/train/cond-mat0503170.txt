    "figure 10 shows the ew curves for @xmath7 in the case of a symmetric trimer described by the @xmath4 heisenberg afm hamiltonian    @xmath236    in this case , it is well - known @xcite that there is no pairwise entanglement both at @xmath12 and at finite temperatures . in the inequality for @xmath7 ( eq.(33 ) ) , the factor @xmath237 is replaced by the factor @xmath0 . in the classical ground state of @xmath205 , the interacting spins form angles of @xmath238 with each other .",
    "the critical temperature is given by @xmath239 .",
    "again , only multipartite entanglement is present in the thermal state of the symmetric trimer .",
    "another ew , which provides an estimate of critical entanglement temperature @xmath8 , is based on energy @xcite .",

    "@xmath245 . if the state is entangled , @xmath246 is < 0 .",
    "for example , if the state belongs to the ground state manifold , @xmath247 @xmath248 thus acts as an ew.the entanglement gap temperature @xmath10 is given by @xmath31 , where @xmath249 @xmath250 is the thermal energy at temperature @xmath251 for @xmath252 , the thermal state is entangled and hence @xmath10 is a measure of the critical entanglement temperature .",

    "thus @xmath10 for the square of spins has an identical magnitude as that of @xmath254 at and above which such entanglement vanishes . in the case of non - bipartite graphs and lattices",

    "the tetrahedron and the symmetric trimer are examples of non - bipartite graphs .",
    "@xmath29 in these two cases can readily be calculated as @xmath255 ( tetrahedron ) and @xmath256 ( symmetric trimer ) .",
    "the entanglement temperature @xmath10 has the magnitude @xmath257 ( tetrahedron ) and @xmath258 ( symmetric trimer ) . in both the cases , two - spin entanglements are absent and the entanglement present in the system for @xmath252",

    "in this paper , we consider a spin tetramer @xmath259 with n.n . ,",
    "diagonal and four - spin afm exchange interactions of strength @xmath110 and @xmath69 respectively .",
    "the significance of the inclusion of three - spin and four - spin interactions in spin hamiltonians of interest has been pointed out earlier @xcite .",
    "we study the ground state and thermal entanglement properties of the tetramer in the various limiting cases . at @xmath12",
    ", qpts occur as the exchange interaction strengths are tuned to certain critical values.we focus on a particular qpt at @xmath113 @xmath260 as the other qpts exhibit similar features .",
    "the qpt point separates two rvb ground states , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the entanglement between two spins is determined by calculating the concurrences @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "concurrences are non - zero only in @xmath88 and the other two concurrences associated with diagonal spins are non - zero only in @xmath89 .",
    "the @xmath261tangle @xmath121 , a measure of the global entanglement , has the value @xmath130 in both @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the entanglement measure @xmath262 defined for pure states , has to be generalized to @xmath263 at the qpt point where the ground state is doubly degenerate .",

    "away from the transition point , @xmath265 in the ground state @xmath88 and @xmath266 in the ground state @xmath89 . a better evidence of the first order qpt is provided by the jumps in both the n.n . and diagonal concurrences @xcite .",
    "the study of finite temperature entanglement properties again shows the existence of two distinctive parameter regimes .",
    "concurrences are non - zero only when @xmath267 and the concurrences associated with diagonal spins are non - zero only when @xmath268 . at @xmath9 ,",
    "all the six concurrences are zero . the critical entanglement temperature , @xmath8 , beyond which entanglement between two spins disappears , is computed .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath8 is highest when @xmath6 and @xmath234 . for fixed values of @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    ", @xmath8 decreases as the strength of the four - spin interaction increases .",
    "a measure of the four - spin entanglement in the thermal state of the tetramer is obtained by calculating the fidelity @xmath224 . the critical temperature , @xmath228 , beyond which the four - spin entanglement disappears is calculated and one finds that at fixed values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the magnitude of @xmath228 decreases as the strength @xmath3 of the four - spin interaction increases .",
    "molecular or nanomagnets provide examples of spin systems in which the dominant exchange interactions are confined to small spin clusters like dimers , trimers and tetramers . in several cases , the magnetic properties",

    "we consider one such compound , @xmath5 , which is a collection of spin tetramers with only n.n .",
    "exchange interactions . treating the magnetic susceptibility @xmath7 as an ew ,",

    "the entanglement includes both bipartite and multipartite entanglement with @xmath8 @xmath269 25.4 k in the case of @xmath5 @xmath270 k ) . from theoretical calculations , the critical temperature @xmath271 , beyond which bipartite entanglement vanishes",
    "is given by @xmath254@xmath272 k. since @xmath273 , multipartite entanglement in the system persists upto a higher temperature .",
    "the entanglement contents of the thermal states of the tetrahedron and the symmetric trimer are shown to be exclusively multipartite in nature .",
    "an ew based on energy provides evidence of bipartite entanglement in the case of a square of spins ( relevant for @xmath5 ) and multipartite entanglement in the cases of the tetrahedron and the symmetric trimer .",
    "the ew based on susceptibility @xmath7 can detect both bipartite and multipartite entanglement .",
    "the ew based on energy detects only bipartite entanglement when the spin system is defined on a bipartite graph or lattice .",
    "the latter ew can detect multipartite entanglement only in the case of a non - bipartite graph or lattice .",
    "the critical entanglement temperature @xmath8 and the entanglement gap temperature @xmath10 have identical values if the corresponding ews both detect entanglement .    after our work was completed , we learnt of a new inequality for susceptibility serving as an ew @xcite .",
    "the inequality can be derived using the sum uncertainty relation for spin@xmath28 operators @xcite .",
    "when @xmath203 , the separability criterion for a single cluster of @xmath24 spins is given by      the results reported by us , using slightly different arguments , are special cases of the general condition ( 40 ) for @xmath24 = 3 and 4 .",
    "we can generalize our derivation in the following manner to obtain ( 40 ) .",
    "we start with the identity      where * _ s _ * is the total spin vector .",
    "the maximum negative contribution to @xmath7 is obtained for * _ s _ * = 0 .",
    "thus for separable states with @xmath276 = @xmath277 , eq.(32 ) reduces to the inequality in ( 40 ) .",
    "there is now a wealth of experimental data on molecular magnets and other magnetic systems which are yet to be analyzed in terms of the entanglement properties of the systems @xcite .",
    "appropriate finite temperature measures of the different types of entanglement need to be developed so that contact between theory and experiments can be made .",
    "a challenging task ahead is to develop suitable ews which provide signatures of the different types of entanglement in the experimental data . +",
