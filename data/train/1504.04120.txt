    "the discovery of topological insulator @xcite has generated strong activities in the condensed matter and high - energy physics communities .",
    "a prominent property of a topological insulator is the existence of gapless surface states in the form of a dirac hamiltonian with momentum and spin directions locked with each other @xcite .",
    "there have been many interesting theoretical predictions , e.g. @xcite , based on the current - spin coupling of this surface hamiltonian .",
    "if the fermi energy is within the bulk gap , it is easy to expect that some physical quantities or phenomena , such as the landau - level spectrum in a perpendicular field @xcite , transport phenomena involving the surface states @xcite , or the rkky interactions @xcite between spins on the surface , can be evaluated from an effective surface hamiltonian . on the other hand",
    ", one may question if some physical quantities do not just rely on effective surface models @xcite .",
    "the response induced by an external magnetic field is one of the interesting topics with above ambiguity .",
    "generally , this perturbation to a system has an effective zeeman field term , a vector potential term , and further contributions @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the surface current response to a static zeeman or exchange field .",
    "we examine if the surface hamiltonian is sufficient to determine this response .",
    "we also can relate the current @xmath0 to the orbital magnetization @xmath1 by @xmath2 @xcite , where @xmath3 is the position .",
    "orbital magnetization is an interesting quantity .",
    "even when the maximally localized wannier functions are used , this magnetization , besides a term (  local circulation \" in @xcite or  self - rotation \" in @xcite ) which can be interpreted in the same way as rotational motion of electrons in isolated atoms , contains a contribution (  itinerant circulation \" in @xcite ) which describes the electronic motion at the edge of the sample . despite the existence of such a current near the sample boundary , it has been shown that the total orbital magnetization is independent of the details at the boundary for an insulator with zero chern number @xcite . with the presence of topological surface states for chern insulators ,",
    "this independence becomes even less obvious .",
    "nevertheless , bianco and resta @xcite provided a real - space expression of orbital magnetization for any two - dimensional insulator with finite chern number , and demonstrated that the formula is independent of boundary conditions for a large sample . on the other hand , chen and",
    "lee @xcite argued that , for a system composed of two insulators with opposite chern numbers , the orbital magnetization should be independent of the details at the boundaries .",
    "they also demonstrated , by numerical calculations , that the orbital magnetization is insensitive to local perturbed potentials near the edge in a chern insulator , and it is also unchanged with magnetic moments at the edges , which gap out the edge states , in spin hall insulator .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to verify if this bulk property still applies for a three - dimensional topological insulator , where there are topologically required surface states with the low energy physics described by two - dimensional dirac fermions .    in an earlier work ,",
    "one of us @xcite analyzed the surface current of a topological insulator generated by an in - plane static zeeman field via perturbation theory , employing an effective hamiltonian that is valid only for small bulk momentum @xmath4 .",
    "he showed that there is a cancelation between the contribution from redistribution of particles ( pauli ) and that from virtual transitions ( van - vleck ) between the surface states .",
    "in particular , due to this cancelation , the current response is independent of the chemical potential when it falls within the bulk gap .",
    "furthermore , it is found that the bulk scattering states also provides a significant contribution of opposite sign to that of the surface states . as a result of this cancelation",
    ", the total surface current has no dramatic change when the system changes from a trivial to a topological insulator .    in this paper , to account more carefully contributions from states of all momenta , we calculate the current response to a static external zeeman field , employing a lattice model . using exact diagonalization , we examine the contributions from both the surface and the scattering states . to gain more physical insights",
    ", we shall consider in some detail the contributions from states with small momenta parallel to the surface and compare these results with those obtained analytically in @xcite .",
    "the cancelation between the pauli and the van - vleck contributions for the surface states , and the van - vleck contributions from the surface versus the bulk states , will be examined more carefully .",
    "we compare the current responses between topological insulators and normal insulators . for the topological insulator",
    ", we demonstrate the independence of the response on the chemical potential ( so long as it is within the bulk gap ) , even though the occupation of the surface states depends on it .",
    "we shall also show that , due to compensation between the surface and scattering states contributions , the total current response is independent of surface magnetic moments which gaps out the surface states .",
    "we shall also discuss effects of different types of external fields on different surfaces .",
    "we consider anisotropic topological insulators and examine the origin of the anisotropy in the current response .",

    "when applying an in - plane zeeman field @xmath43 to a system with spin - orbit coupling , one can expect redistribution of particles around the fermi surface because these states have spin - momentum locking and the energy levels become lower or higher as the spin prefers to be along or against the external field .",
    "therefore there is a contribution to the current in the transversal direction of the field .",

    "@xcite , the virtual transition between the surface states is not enough to get a physical answer for the current response to an external field , since the result depends on the momentum cut - off employed .",

    "[ kappa - mi2](a ) , we obtain vanished @xmath60 after summing over all states .",

    "it is somewhat difficult to separate clearly the surface versus bulk states when @xmath65 becomes comparable to the @xmath105 where these states merge into each other , but our calculation shows that @xmath64 seems to vanish when summing over all surface states .",

    "we note that at the parallel momentum where a surface merges with the bulk states , the decaying length of the surface state diverges , and therefore a finite localized magnetic moment at the surface will result only in a vanishing perturbation .",
    "the vanishing of the current from the surface states can then be understood as due to the fact that now the surface state spectra simply shifts in momentum space with their end points fixed .",

    "[ kappa - mi2 ] , @xmath62 within @xmath65 is also in general finite . in particular",

    "since we are evaluating the linear response , we can see from fig .",
    "[ kappa - mi2 ] that the response for a uniform @xmath48 is just the sum of the responses for the two non - uniform @xmath48 cases discussed above , as it should be .",

    "[ kappa - kr](c ) and [ kappa - mi](c ) ) , suggesting again that there are no van - vleck contributions due to surface to bulk virtual transitions for our non - uniform @xmath48 s .",
    "figure [ kappa - mi2](d ) shows the position dependence of the total current response for the case where @xmath48 is localized at the surface . there is a sharp ( lattice - scale ) feature near the surface",
    "this is followed by a slower feature of opposite sign decaying into the bulk , with an @xmath9-dependent decaying length ( around @xmath106 for @xmath56 and @xmath107 for @xmath108 . )",
    "this pattern then is roughly a current loop around the localized external field @xmath48 . for a thick sample ,",
    "there is thus no net current on the bottom surface .",
    "when comparing the current responses to external fields with different directions , we should take more care about the form of the perturbation hamiltonian .",

    ", we shall have more discussion on this point .    we can limit possible terms in the hamiltonian by symmetry arguments .",
    "since an external magnetic field is a pseudo - vector which also breaks the time - reversal symmetry , the allowed terms in the hamiltonian describing the effects of a magnetic field can be @xcite h_b = -*b_1**s - * b_2**s_x , [ h - mi ] where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are external magnetic fields scaled with appropriate directional dependent @xmath112-factors .",

    "these conclusions agreed with those of @xcite which analyzes only states with small momenta . the responses might be possibly be understood by considering the reaction of the surface states to the external fields , which is summarized in table [ table ] .",
    "therefore , it might be reasonable to expect that the system has a current response as the surface cone is shifted by external fields .",
