    "the proton electromagnetic form factors have been studied extensively for many years as probes of the proton structure .",
    "polarization experiments can measure directly the ratio of the proton electric to magnetic form factor , @xmath3 and revealed a qualitatively different behavior than the traditional rosenbluth separation .",
    "future experiments are being planned to study both the small and the large momentum dependence of these form factors .",
    "lattice qcd provides a well - suited framework for the determination of these quantities .",
    "this is particularly true nowadays with the availability of simulations with quark masses fixed to their physical values . in the lattice qcd formulation",
    "the form factors are evaluated at discrete values of the momentum transfer .",
    "access to low momentum transfers is crucial and will enable a better determination of the magnetic moment of the proton as well as the root mean squared ( r.m.s . ) radius of the transverse electric and magnetic quark distribution in the nucleon . computing the electric r.m.s .",
    "radius of the proton is particularly important due to the existing discrepancy between the muonic determination yielding a value of @xmath4  fm  @xcite and the electron scattering and hydrogen spectroscopy value of @xmath5  fm  @xcite . to access small momentum transfers",
    "we need a lattice with large spatial extent , @xmath6 , since the smallest available momentum in a finite box is @xmath7 for periodic boundary conditions . in order to extract the magnetic moment one needs to determine the magnetic form factor at zero momentum transfer . because the kinematical factor multiplying the magnetic form factor vanishes at zero momentum transfer one can not extract it directly at zero momentum . instead one resorts to an extrapolation using an ansatz to fit its momentum dependence .",
    "similarly , to determine the radii one needs the derivative of the form factors in the limit of zero momentum transfer and thus an ansatz for the momentum dependence .",
    "given that on a finite lattice only discrete values of the momentum are allowed , such extrapolations can introduce uncontrolled errors .",
    "in this article we investigate an approach that allows us to remove momentum prefactors in the form factor decomposition of a matrix element computed within lattice qcd .",
    "methods of this kind have been applied already in various forms in the study of the hadronic vacuum polarization on the lattice @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to the inclusive process described by hadronic vacuum polarization , the extraction of a form factor associated with the ground state of a correlation function requires modifications and further development of these methods .",

    "we discuss the improvements made to avoid the residual time dependence that did not allow the application of the method to lattice three point functions .",

    "the method can also be extended to the case of radii for which results will be reported in the future .",
    "before we apply our approach to the magnetic form factor we first demonstrate its validity by applying it to evaluate the isovector electric sachs form factor at zero momentum transfer .",
    "the latter is by definition equal to one if the lattice conserved electromagnetic current is used and , in addition , it can be extracted directly from the lattice matrix element without the need to deal with a momentum factor in the decomposition .",
    "it thus provides a very suitable test case . after demonstrating the suitability of our method with the electric form factor",
    "we apply it to compute the magnetic form factor at zero momentum transfer , which otherwise requires a fit ansatz to extrapolate the lattice data to zero momentum .",
    "we find that the value extracted is larger than what a dipole fit to the form factor would yield .",

    "thus , the first step is the same as the standard method for extracting data at nonzero momentum , which is then used e.g. for a dipole fit .",
