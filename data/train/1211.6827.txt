    "the tracking ( rejection ) problem for a nonlinear benchmark system called translational oscillator with a rotational actuator ( tora ) and also known as rotational - translational actuator ( rtac ) has received a considerable amount of attention these years @xcite-@xcite .",
    "some results were presented concerning the tracking ( rejection ) problem for general external signals @xcite,@xcite .",
    "however , the proposed control methods can not achieve asymptotic disturbance rejection . taking this into account ,",
    "the nonlinear output regulation theory was applied to track ( reject ) external signals generated by an autonomous system . in this case",
    ", asymptotic disturbance rejection can be achieved . by using different measurement , the tracking ( rejection ) problem for translational displacement of the tora",
    "were investigated @xcite-@xcite .",
    "readers can refer to @xcite for details .",
    "based on the same benchmark system , some other work was also presented concerning the tracking ( rejection ) problem for rotational position by nonlinear output regulation theory @xcite,@xcite .",
    "for the two types of tracking ( rejection ) problems , regulator equations have to be solved and then the resulting solutions will be further used in the controller design .",
    "however , the difficulty of constructing and solving regulator equations will increase as the complexity of external signals increases . moreover",
    ", it may fail to design a controller if regulator equations have no solutions .",
    "these are our major motivation .    in this paper ,",
    "the tracking ( rejection ) problem for rotational position of the tora as @xcite,@xcite is revisited by a new control scheme called _ additive - state - decomposition - based tracking control _ , which is based on the _ _ additive state decomposition__. the proposed additive state decomposition is a new decomposition manner different from the lower - order subsystem decomposition methods . concretely , taking the system @xmath1 for example , it is decomposed into two subsystems : @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4and@xmath5 respectively .",
    "the lower - order subsystem decomposition satisfies@xmath6 by contrast , the proposed additive state decomposition satisfies@xmath7 in our opinion , lower - order subsystem decomposition aims to reduce the complexity of the system itself , while the additive state decomposition emphasizes the reduction of the complexity of tasks for the system .    by following the philosophy above",
    ", the original tracking ( rejection ) task is ` additively ' decomposed into two independent subtasks , namely the tracking ( rejection ) subtask for a linear time invariant ( lti ) system and the stabilization subtask for a derived nonlinear system .",
    "since tracking ( rejection ) subtask only needs to be achieved on an lti system , the complexity of external signals can be handled easier by the transfer function method .",
    "it is proved that the designed controller can tackle the tracking ( rejection ) problem for rotational position of the tora in the presence of any external signal ( except for the frequency at @xmath0 ) generated by a marginally stable autonomous lti system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the problem is formulated and the additive state decomposition is recalled briefly first . in section 3 , an observer is proposed to compensate for nonlinearity ; then the resulting system is ` additively ' decomposed into two subsystems ; sequently , controllers are designed for them . in section 4 , numerical simulation is given .",
    "section 5 concludes this paper .",
    "as shown in fig.1 , the tora system consists of a cart attached to a wall with a spring .",
    "the cart is affected by a disturbance force @xmath8 .",
    "an unbalanced point mass rotates around the axis in the center of the cart , which is actuated by a control torque @xmath9 the translational displacement of the cart is denoted by @xmath10 and the rotational position of the unbalanced point mass is denoted by @xmath11    for simplicity , after normalization and transformation , the tora system is described by the following state - space representation @xcite :    [ rtacmodel0]@xmath12 where @xmath13 @xmath14{cccc}x_{1 } & x_{2 } & x_{3 } & x_{4}\\end{array } ] ^{t}\\in\\mathbb{r } ^{4}$ ] , @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the unknown dimensionless disturbance , @xmath17 is the dimensionless control torque . in this paper ,",
    "the tracking ( rejection ) problem for rotational position of the tora as @xcite,@xcite is revisited .",
    "concretely , for system ( [ rtacmodel0 ] ) , it is to design a controller @xmath18 such that the output @xmath19 as @xmath20 meanwhile keeping the other states bounded , where @xmath21 is a known constant .",
    "obviously , this is a nonlinear nonminimum phase tracking problem , or say a nonlinear weakly minimum phase tracking problem . for system ( [ rtacmodel0 ] ) , the following assumptions are imposed .    _ assumption 1_. the state @xmath22 can be obtained .",
    "_ assumption 2_. the disturbance @xmath16 is generated by an autonomous lti system    @xmath23    where @xmath24 , @xmath25 are constant matrix , @xmath26 and the pair @xmath27 is observable .    _",
    "remark 1_. if all eigenvalues of @xmath28 have zero real part , then , in suitable coordinates , the matrix @xmath28 can always be written to be a skew - symmetric matrix .",

    "in such a case , @xmath31 is in the form as sin@xmath32 and the solution to the regulator equation is easier to obtain .",
    "however , this is a difficulty when @xmath28 is complicated .      in order to make the paper self - contained ,",
    "the additive state decomposition @xcite is recalled here briefly .",
    "consider the following ` original ' system:@xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "we first bring in a ` primary ' system having the same dimension as ( [ gen_orig_sys ] ) , according to:@xmath35 where @xmath36 . from the original system ( [ gen_orig_sys ] ) and the primary system ( [ gen_pri_sys ] ) we derive the following ` secondary ' system:@xmath37 where @xmath36 is given by the primary system ( [ gen_pri_sys ] ) .",

    "our decomposition is additive . in addition , this decomposition is with respect to state .",
    "so , we call it additive state decomposition__. _ _    as a special case of ( [ gen_orig_sys ] ) , a class of differential dynamic systems is considered as follows:@xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 two systems , denoted by the primary system and ( derived ) secondary system respectively , are defined as follows:@xmath45 and@xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    ". the secondary system ( [ dif_sec_sys ] ) is determined by the original system ( [ dif_orig_sys ] ) and the primary system ( [ dif_pri_sys ] ) . from the definition ,",
    "in this section , in order to decrease nonlinearity , an observer is proposed to compensate for the nonlinear term @xmath50 after the compensation , the resulting nonlinear nonminimum phase tracking system  is decomposed into two systems by the additive state decomposition : an lti system including all external signals as the primary system , leaving the secondary system with a zero equilibrium point .",
    "therefore , the tracking problem for the original system is correspondingly decomposed into two subproblems by the additive state decomposition : a tracking problem for the lti ` primary ' system and a stabilization problem for the secondary system .",
