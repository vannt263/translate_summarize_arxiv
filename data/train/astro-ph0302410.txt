    "accretion onto a supermassive black hole is regarded as the energy sources of agns ( rees 1984 ) . energy output from accretion disks",
    "strongly depends on their structures and radiation efficiency , which is mainly controlled by the eddington ratio , defined by the dimenssionless accretion rate @xmath7 , where @xmath8 g  s@xmath5 , @xmath9 is the accretion rate , @xmath0 the black hole mass and the accretion efficiency @xmath10 ( chen et al .",
    "1997 , frank , king & raine 2002 ) .",
    "it has been realized that many observable features of agns could be driven by @xmath11 ( boroson & green 1992 , boroson 2002 ) , however , it is not easy to estimate @xmath11 from observations .",
    "we need a more reliable and convenient criteria based on theory to test whether agns have super - eddington accretion rates .",
    "much attention has been given to estimate the black hole masses in agns and inactive galaxies ( kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ) so that the black hole mass becomes an easily `` measured '' quantity .",
    "there are currently four fundamental ways to reliably estimate the mass of the black holes by : 1 ) reverberation mapping methods for agns ( wandel , peterson & malkan 1999 , kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) , 2 ) the empirical relation of the reverberation mapping ( netzer 2003 , vestergaard 2002 ) , 3 ) relation between @xmath12 ( kormendy & richstone 1995 , ho 1999 , mclure & dunlop 2001 ) , where @xmath13 is the absolute @xmath14-band magnitudes of the host galaxies , 4 ) the relation @xmath15 ( ferrarese & merrit 2000 , gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 , tremaine et al . 2002 ) , including the method from the fundamental plan , where @xmath16 is the dispersion velocity . employing the empirical relation of reverberation mapping ,",
    "one can conveniently obtain the masses of the black holes in a large sample spanning a wide range of redshift ( netzer 2003 ) . with these estimations ,",
    "the eddington ratio can be estimated via @xmath17 , where @xmath18 ( kaspi et al .",
    "2000 , netzer 2003 ) .",
    "it has been found that some agns may have super - eddington accretion rates due to @xmath19 .",
    "they consist of some narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars ( collin & hur 2001 , collin et al .",
    "2002 , king & puchnarewicz 2002 , wang & netzer 2003 ) .",
    "one of the most prominent features is the strong soft x - ray humps ( king 2002 , king & puchnarewicz 2002 , wang & netzer 2003 ) .",
    "the structure of the super - eddington accretion disk remains open .",
    "begelman ( 1978 ) and begelman & meier ( 1982 ) suggested that a photon trapping process may happen in a super - eddington accretion .",
    "the classical model of the slim accretion disk ( @xmath20 ) based on the vertical averaged equations advocated by abramowicz et al ( 1988 ) removes the thermal instability of the radiation pressure - dominated region since the advection as an efficient cooling dominates over the diffusive cooling from the disk surface ( chen & taam 1993 ) .",
    "the detail treatment of the photon trapping inside the slim disk has been done by ohsuga et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who showed the maximum luminosity is about eddington luminosity .",
    "this is roughly in agreement with wang & zhou ( 1999 ) . on the other hand",
    ", gammie ( 1998 ) showed that a _ magnetized _ accretion disk may have photon bubble instability in the radiation pressure - dominated region of the standard accretion disk model ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "such an instability in the super - eddington accretion disks should be enhanced since the photons are trapped inside the disks and the radiation pressure is much higher than that in shakura & sunyaev s disk .",
    "begelman ( 2002 ) suggested that the inhomogeneous distribution of the accreted matter will be formed due to the photon bubble instability and the maximum luminosity will exceed eddington luminosity by a factor of one hundred for galactic mass of the black hole .",
    "both the spectra and the behavior of variabilities from slim disk ( wang et al .",
    "1999 ; wang & netzer 2003 ; mineshige et al .",
    "2000 ) are not sufficiently understood as well as the roles of the photon bubble instability ( begelman 2002 ) .",
    "it may be difficult to directly test the structure of the super - eddington accretion disk in an individual objects , but statistic test may provide invaluable information .",
    "we show in this paper that @xmath17 can not properly represent the accretion disk rates in agns , particularly for those with super - eddington accretion rates .",
    "we suggest a limit relation between the black hole mass and h@xmath2 width based on the theoretical models to test whether the accretion disks in agns have super - eddington accretion rates .",
    "these limit relations are useful to probe the structures of the disks with super - eddington rates .",
    "measuring the response of the broad emission line to the variations of the continuum can provide the distance of the clouds from the central black hole in agns .",
    "kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) provided the results of the reverberation mapping in a sample consisting of 34 agns and found a strong correlation between the size of the broad line region ( @xmath21 ) and the luminosity at 5100 , namely , the empirical reverberation relation @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the continuum luminosity at wavelength @xmath26 .",
    "this relation has been calibrated by vestergaard ( 2002 ) using the bivariate correlated errors and intrinsic scatter algorithm .",
    "the specific values of @xmath27 and @xmath2 are in debate ( see vestergaard 2002 , netzer 2003 ) .",
    "a constant ionization parameter @xmath28 , defined by @xmath29 , leads to a relation @xmath30 ( wandel , peterson & malkan 1999 ) , where @xmath31 is the number density of electrons in ionized medium and @xmath32 is the ionizing luminosity .",
    "this is supported by the argument that the outer boundary of the blr is determined by dust sublimation radius ( netzer & laor 1993 ) .",
    "we keep the uncertainty of the index @xmath2 in mind , however it does not influence the existence of the limit relation between @xmath0 and h@xmath2 width derived in the present paper .    for a given black hole , the continuum luminosity from an accretion disk increases with the accretion rate ( but below the eddington rate ) and hence an increase of the blr size according to the empirical reverberation relation ( equation 1 ) .",
    "this implies that a high accretion rate leads to a relatively narrow width of h@xmath2 for a sub - eddington accretion disk in agn if the assumption that the broad line emitting - clouds are virialized in the black hole potential works ( see equation 2 ) .",
    "when the accretion rate exceeds the eddington rate , the radiated luminosity from the disk very weakly depends on the accretion rate ( @xmath33 ) , but linearly proportional to the mass of the black hole in the context of the slim disk model ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 , wang & zhou 1999 ; mineshige et al .",
    "2000 ; ohsuga et al .",
    "thus the radiated luminosity is _ saturated _ , leading to a _ constant _ blr size independent of the accretion rate for a fixed black hole .",
    "we call this the eddington size and the eddington width of the emission line accordingly . for agns with super - eddington accretion rates ,",
    "the eddington width of h@xmath2 directly reflects the potential of the black holes . in the context of the photon trapping disk a relation of @xmath0 and fwhm(h@xmath2 ) is then expected .",
    "however , it has been argued that magnetized disks with dominance of radiation pressure are suffering from photon bubble instability ( gammie 1998 ) .",
    "the disks become so inhomogeneous on scales much smaller than the radiation pressure scale height that the radiation will be squeezed by gravity out of overdense region enhanced by the magnetic tension while the underdense regions become tenuous due to the acceleration of radiation force .",
    "some of the trapped photons may be liberated from the disk via this instability .",
    "thus the eddington limit may be relaxed by this way .",
    "begelman ( 2001 , 2002 ) investigated the photon bubble instability in a super - eddington accretion disk and found the maximum radiated luminosity @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , keeping a geometrically thin shape , when the accretion rate reaches its maximum .",
    "we call this the begelman limit .",
    "it is not clear what the radiated luminosity is before @xmath9 reaches its maximum as well as the emergent spectrum from such disks .",
    "if the photon bubble instability works as a mechanism liberating the trapped photons in agn super - eddington accretion disks , the blr size will be larger than the eddington size , resulting in a narrower width of h@xmath2 than the eddington width .",
    "thus the different structure of the super - eddington accretion disk should lead to different limit relations between fwhm(h@xmath2 ) and @xmath0 .",
    "this lends us a possibility to statistically test the structure of the super - eddington accretion disk based on the available data of fwhm(h@xmath2 ) and @xmath0 .      the broad line h@xmath2 emitting clouds are virialized in the gravitational potential of the supermassive black hole , the mass of the black hole is expressed by the fwhm(h@xmath2 ) @xmath36 where we take @xmath37 for the corrections of geometry and kinetics ( peterson & wandel 1999 , fromerth & melia 2000 , mclure & dunlop 2001 , krolik 2001 ) .",
    "the factor @xmath38 remains a matter for debate of blr geometry , but @xmath39 is expected .",
    "we need to calculate the luminosity at 5100   from the emergent spectrum from the slim disk .",
    "this has been done in detail by wang et al .",
    "we find that @xmath40 for a supermassive black hole .",
    "combining the equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we have a relation between fwhm(h@xmath2 ) and @xmath0 , @xmath41 where @xmath42 km  s@xmath5 and the constant @xmath43 is @xmath44 this relation clearly relies on two model - dependent parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which are determined by the spectrum and the structure of the super - eddington accretion disk .",
    "such a dependence can thus be used to probe the structures of the super - eddington accretion disks .",
    "the photon trapping process efficiently lowers the radiated luminosity from the disk , resulting in a very weak dependence of the radiated luminosity on @xmath47 . for a photon trapping accretion flow , @xmath48 ( wang & zhou 1999 , ohsuga et al .",
    "2002 ) , we have the eddington limit from equation ( 3 ) as @xmath49 where @xmath50 . for the empirical relation of reverberation mapping given by kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , we have a limit relation of @xmath51 , where @xmath52 for @xmath53 and @xmath39 .",
    "the eddington limit lines are shown in figure 1 .",
    "this is a very strong dependence on fwhm(h@xmath2 ) .",
    "those objects below this line in the fwhm(h@xmath6 plot have sub - eddington accretion rates .    on the other hand",
    ", the photon bubble instability may operate in a super - eddington accretion disk and the maximum luminosity from the disk reads @xmath54 where @xmath55 for the maximum accretion rate ( begelman 2002 ) .",
    "such a high luminosity will strongly affect the blr size , equation ( 3 ) for the begelman limit is changed to @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "the spectrum from a disk with the photon bubble instability is highly unknown , we take @xmath58 to get @xmath59 for an illustration , we have @xmath60 if the kaspi et al.s relation is used .",
    "this relation is highly different from that determined by the photon trapping process . for a disk with the photon bubble instability ,",
    "the fwhm(h@xmath6 relation is beyond the scope of the frame of figure 1 , we draw @xmath61 line for the illustration of the begelman limit in figure 1 .",
    "a potentially realistic situation may be a hybrid structure undergoing the photon trapping and photon bubble instability in the region between the eddington and the begelman lines , where some objects appear if they have a super - eddington accretion rate .",
    "the eddington ratio is usually estimated by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 ( kaspi et al .",
    "2000 , telfer et al . 2002 , netzer 2003 ) .",
    "if @xmath19 , this object is generally thought to be a super - eddington accretor .",
    "however , we argue that @xmath62 does not simply imply a super - eddington accretion in practice . if an object with @xmath63 really has a super - eddington accretion rate , it should locate on the eddington limit line ( photon trapping ) , or between the begelman and eddington lines ( a hybrid structure of photon trapping and photon bubble instability ) .",
    "the fwhm(h@xmath6 relation can be used to reliably test the super - eddington accretion in agns .",
    "it should be noted that the fwhm(h@xmath6 relation is very sensitive to @xmath2 due to the indices @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "any small calibrations on the empirical relation of reverberation mapping will be important to the limit relation . @xmath66 and @xmath67 were suggested by netzer ( 2003 ) for the cosmology assumed in the present paper @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 based on the bces ( bivariate correlated errors and intrinsic scatter ) estimator .",
    "we plot the eddington limit lines for both of the kaspi et al s and netzer s values of ( @xmath71 ) , and the begelman limit line for kaspi et al s value in figure 1 .",
    "it is interesting to search super - eddington accretions and to test their structures in agns via the limit relation of fwhm(h@xmath6 .",
    "we assemble objects from the literatures ,    in which their black hole masses can be estimated by 1 ) the reverberation mapping , 2 ) the @xmath72 relation and 3 ) the @xmath73 relation .",
    "the three methods are independent of the method of the empirical reverberation relation as used by netzer ( 2003 ) in a large sample of agns .",
    "this allows us to test the super - eddington accretion disks in agns .",
    "we still estimate the eddington ratio via @xmath17 , where @xmath74 ( telfer et al . 2002 , netzer 2003 ) in order to compare with the fwhm(h@xmath6 limit relation .",
    "we omitted five objects ( ic 4329a , ngc 3227 , ngc 7469 , pg 1700 and pg 1704 ) in kaspi et al.s sample since their lower uncertainties are too large .",
    "there are 30 objects measured by reverberation mapping , 29 from kaspi et al.s sample and ngc 3783 from onken & peterson ( 2002 ) .",
    "mclure & dunlop ( 2001 ) present 45 objects with host galaxy absolute magnitude @xmath75 , in which 15 seyfert galaxies of objects have been measured by reverberation mapping ( kaspi et al .",
    "we thus use the results of the reverberation mapping but we take the absolute magnitudes of ic 4329a , ngc 3227 and ngc 7469 since their lower limits of the black hole mass are too uncertain by the reverberation mapping .",
    "we take 17 of 37 radio - loud quasars with @xmath75 assembled by wang , ho & staubert ( 2002)[the rest radio - loud quasars in wang et al .",
    "( 2002 ) overlap with that given by mclure & dunlop ( 2001 ) ] .",

    "( 2002 ) extend the relationship @xmath16@xmath77fwhm([o iii ] ) in nelson ( 2000 ) . using fwhm([o iii ] ) as the stellar dispersion velocity @xmath16 , the relation @xmath78 ( tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ) enables us to reliably estimate the masses of the black holes in 84 quasars ( 35 rlqs + 49 rqqs ) in shields sample .",
    "the error bars in this sample are given by the largest intrinsic scatter ( @xmath79 ) ( shields et al .",
    "totally there are 164 objects in our present sample .",
    "figure 1 shows the @xmath1(h@xmath6 plot of the 164 agns .",
    "according to @xmath17 and @xmath74 , 19 of 84 quasars in shields et al.s sample are super - eddington accretors . the    table 1    list of candidates of super - eddington agns    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     values of @xmath80 of the 19 quasars span from zero ( vcv 0331 - 37 ) to the maximum 0.7 ( pg 1216 + 069 ) , however these objects are located far below the eddington limit line as shown by figure 1 .",
    "if we take @xmath81 , there will be a quite large fraction of the objects with @xmath19 and most of these objects are still located far below the eddington limit lines .",
    "it follows from the eddington limit that these objects have sub - eddington rates though they have @xmath19 .",
    "we find that pg 1001 + 054 , mrk 478 and ms 2254 - 37 with @xmath82 are located above the eddington limit line .",
    "the three may be super - eddington accretors .",
    "this inconsistency between the eddington limit line and @xmath83 values in some objects reflects : 1 ) the intrinsic scatter of @xmath84 , namely , the ratio @xmath83 is not fully reliable to estimate @xmath85 as noted by netzer ( 2003 ) ; 2 ) the estimation of the black hole mass via fwhm ( ) has a larger uncertainty . as shown by boroson ( 2003 ) in sdss edr sample of 107 radio - quiet quasars and seyfert 1 galaxies , the correlation between fwhm([oiii ] ) and @xmath0 is rather scatter , where @xmath0 is determined by kaspi et al s empirical relation of reverberation mapping .",
    "the fwhm(h@xmath6 relation also indicates the scatters of fwhm([oiii])@xmath86 relation by this inconsistency .",
    "therefore , the fwhm(h@xmath6 relation may be more reliable to test whether an object has a super - eddington accretion rate if the mass of the black hole is well determined .",
    "mrk 478 , pg 1001 + 054 and ms 2254 - 37 are narrow line seyert 1 galaxies [ fwhm(h@xmath87  km  s@xmath5 ] ( grupe et al .",

    "even we use the masses by empirical relation of reverberation , the three objects are still located on or close to the eddington limit line .",
    "we thus suggest that they are probably super - eddington accretors .    in the sample of mclure & dunlop ( 2001 )",
    ", we take the data of mrk 355 from the reverberation mapping measurements by kaspi et al . ( 2000 ) and the data of @xmath89 and fwhm(h@xmath90 km s@xmath5 in ngc 4051 from peterson et al .",

    "we find that the masses of the black holes in pg 0157 + 001 , q 0204 + 292 and q 2247 + 140 are quite different from @xmath72 and reverberation relation methods .",
    "the mass of the black hole in q 0204 + 292 is of @xmath92 from @xmath72 relation since the magnitude of its host galaxy is quite bright @xmath93 ( mclure & dunlop 2001 ) . on the other hand",
    "its fwhm(h@xmath94  km  s@xmath5 is very narrow , the black hole mass is @xmath95 .",
    "the three objects locate above the eddington limit lines even for their masses from empirical reverberation relation .",
    "we suggest that the three objects may be candidates of super - eddington accretors .",
    "no object with @xmath19 has been found in kaspi et al.s sample , but pg 1351 + 640 locates above eddington limit line . it may thus be a super - eddington accretor .",
    "no super - eddington has been found in the radio - loud quasar sample of wang , ho & staubert ( 2002 ) , who obtain the eddington ratio from the converting the total emission line luminosity into ionizing luminosity .",
    "there is only one marginal object , pg 2201 + 315 , which is located close to the eddington limit whereas the others locate below the eddington limit .",
    "we would like to stress that the above remarks are based on that the black hole masses are fully reliable .    for kaspi et al.s relation @xmath23",

    "if the black hole masses of these objects are less uncertain , they are likely super - eddington accretors .",
    "we note that these objects locate the region between the begelman and eddington limit lines .",
    "one interesting possibility is that these objects are undergoing a hybrid process of photon trapping and photon bubble instability .",
    "it would be necessary to do the observation of reverberation mapping for these objects or measure the stellar dispersion velocity of their host galaxies in order to more reliably determine the black hole masses and the structure of the super - eddington accretion disks .",
    "additionally , the variabilities in the x - ray band will be very helpful to understand the physics in these objects ( photon trapping or photon bubble instability ) .",
    "all the objects listed in table 1 have a narrower width of h@xmath2 ( @xmath98  km  s@xmath5 ) .",
    "based on the limit relation , one of prominent features of super - eddington accretion candidates is the presence of the relatively narrow width of h@xmath2 . if the largest black hole mass is of @xmath99 among angs ( netzer 2003 ) , the maximum eddington width is given by @xmath100 therefore searching super - eddington agns should be confined in those with h@xmath2 width narrower than this eddington width @xmath101 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "an interesting work is to apply the present limits to narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies , which are regarded to be less massive black hole with higher accretion rates .",
    "the instability may make the disk inhomogeneous ( fabian et al . 2002 ) .",
    "however the current data does not allow us to do so .",
    "it is suggested to do measurements of reverberation mapping for a sample of nls1 for the determination of the black hole masses in order to probe the structures of the super - eddington accretion disks .",
    "the objects in the present samples used in this paper are low redshift .",
    "the above discussion can be easily extended to the relation between c iv / mg ii width and the mass of the black hole for high redshift quasars using the empirical relation of reverberation mapping ( vestergaard 2002 , netzer 2003 ) .",
    "finally , we would like to point out the response of blr size to the increases of disk s luminosity . according to the kaspi et al.s relation ,",
    "the virializing timescale of the clouds in blr is of @xmath102  ( yrs ) , where @xmath103 , which is much shorter than the super - eddington accretion timescale ( @xmath104 yrs ) .",

    "if the super - eddington accretion lasts several million years , we should observe its effects on the width of broad emission lines .",
    "based on the super - eddington accretion disk models of the photon trapping and photon bubble instability , we have derived a limit relation between the black hole mass and h@xmath2 width via the empirical relation of reverberation mapping in agns .",

    "<S> in this paper , we show that there is a limit relation between the black hole mass ( @xmath0 ) and the width at the half maximum ( @xmath1 ) of h@xmath2 for active galactic nuclei ( agns ) with super - eddington accretion rates . </S>",
    "<S> when a black hole has a super - eddington accretion rate , the empirical relation of reverberation mapping has two possible ways . </S>",
    "<S> first , it reduces to a relation between the black hole mass and the size of the broad line region due to the photon trapping effects inside the accretion disk . for the kaspi et al.s empirical reverberation relation </S>",
    "<S> , we get the limit relation as @xmath3 , called as the eddington limit . </S>",
    "<S> second , the eddington limit luminosity will be relaxed if the trapped photons can escape from the magnetized super - eddington accretion disk via the photon bubble instability , and the size of the broad line region will be enlarged according to the empirical reverberation relation , leading to a relatively narrow width of h@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we call this the begelman limit .    </S>",
    "<S> super - eddington accretions in a sample composed of 164 agns have been searched by this limit relation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that most of them are well confined by the eddington limit relation , namely most of the objects in the sample have sub - eddington accretion rates , but there are a handful of objects locate between the eddington and begelman limit lines , they may be candidates of super - eddington accretors in a hybrid structure of photon trapping and photon bubble instability . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum width of h@xmath2 is in the reange of @xmath4  km  s@xmath5 for the maximum mass black holes with super - eddington accretion rates among agns . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the fwhm(h@xmath6 relation is more reliable and convenient to test whether a source is super - eddington and useful to probe the structure of the super - eddington accretion process . </S>"
