    "phase transitions in one - dimensional systems are unusual , essentially because , as long as the interactions are of finite range and strength , any putative ordered state at finite temperature will be disrupted by thermally induced defects , and a defect in one dimension is very effective at destroying order . despite this , there are many examples of one - dimensional systems that do exhibit a phase transition .",
    "the farey fraction spin chain ( ffsc ) @xcite is one such case , which has attracted interest from both physicists and mathematicians @xcite .",
    "( since this work uses some methods that may be unfamiliar to the latter , we include a paragraph at the end of this section outlining our results from a mathematical viewpoint . )    one can define the ffsc as a periodic chain of sites with two possible spin states ( @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) at each site .",
    "this model is rigorously known to exhibit a single phase transition at temperature @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the phase transition itself is most unusual . the low temperature state is completely ordered @xcite . in the limit of a long chain , for @xmath5 ,",
    "the system is either all @xmath2 or all @xmath3 .",
    "therefore the free energy @xmath6 is constant and the magnetization @xmath7 ( defined via the difference in the number of spins in state @xmath2 vs.  those in state @xmath3 ) is completely saturated over this entire temperature range .",
    "thus , even though the system has a phase transition at finite temperature , there are no thermal effects at all in the ordered state .",
    "the same thermodynamics occurs in the knauf spin chain ( ksc ) @xcite , to which the ffsc is closely related .    at temperatures above the phase transition ( for @xmath8 ) , fluctuations occur , and @xmath6 decreases with @xmath9 . here the system is paramagnetic , since ( when the external field vanishes , see below ) there is no symmetry - breaking field .",
    "thus as the temperature increases @xmath7 jumps from its saturated value in the ordered phase to zero in the high - temperature phase @xcite ( see fig .  [ fig ] ) .",
    "( the ksc behaves similarly . )",
    "one - dimensional models with long - range ferromagnetic interactions @xcite are known to exhibit a discontinuity in @xmath7 at @xmath10 , but in these cases the jump in @xmath7 is less than the saturation value .",

    "now we can look at the change in entropy ( per site ) @xmath17 across the phase boundary .",

    "when @xmath128 , already mentioned , one finds that both @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "however , it is easy to see that both the susceptibility @xmath137 and the specific heat will have a discontinuity across the phase boundary .    note that the magnetization change given by ( [ cm ] ) exhibits a kind of  discontinuity of the discontinuity \" , in that its limiting value as one approaches the second - order point is not the same as its value at that point .",
    "this is not the case for the entropy change , or for these quantities in the model examined in section [ kdp ] .",
    "finally , we argue that @xmath70 is not possible in the high - temperature phase . since the second derivative of @xmath6 with respect to @xmath0 at @xmath1 is proportional to both @xmath66 and the susceptibility @xmath137 , it suffices to demonstrate that @xmath138 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath137 is proportional to @xmath139 where the spin variables @xmath140 ( cf .",
    "( [ m ] ) ) , and the angular brackets denote a thermal average . now the @xmath141 term in this sum is @xmath142 , and due to the ferromagnetic interactions in the spin chain , the remaining terms can not be negative .",
    "note that this argument is not completely rigorous , since for the ffsc we only have numerical evidence that the interactions are all ferromagnetic .",
    "the ksc , on the other hand , is known to have all interactions ferromagnetic @xcite , so that @xmath143 follows from the gks inequalities .",
    "we can use our results to make some predictions about finite - size ( i.e.  @xmath21 large but @xmath144 ) effects on the thermodynamics .",
    "we make the standard assumption that the size of our spin chain is a relevant field with eigenvalue @xmath142 . of course",
    ", since our system has long - range interactions the validity of finite - size scaling may be questioned @xcite , but it is still interesting to see the results .",
    "the treatment is the same as in the case of the relevant fields @xmath67 and @xmath0 . the renormalization equation for the inverse size",

    "since this is not what we found for the ffsc , we consider another way to introduce an external field @xmath0 into the kdp model .        as before we have four different states for each cell .",
    "we index them with spin - one variables @xmath193 and @xmath194 ( @xmath195 ) in each cell as in fig .",
    "[ kdp2 ] . then the energy ( for @xmath1 ) can be written @xmath196 ( assuming , in the sum , that the infinite energy contributions are omitted ) .",
    "the conditions @xmath197 and @xmath198 define the allowed states .",
    "we define the magnetization per site as @xmath199 note that this definition gives a positive ( negative ) contribution if the upper dot in a given cell is on the right ( left ) .",

    "the phase boundary is given by @xmath205 for @xmath206 and @xmath39 , using @xmath207 , this gives @xmath208 the phase diagram near the critical point is very close to the previous one ( see fig .  [ pk ] ) .",
    "the magnetization in the ordered phase is again independent of temperature , i.e.  @xmath209 . in the high - temperature phase",
    "we have @xmath210 .",
    "thus the magnetization change across the phase boundary close to the critical point is @xmath211 .",
    "the transition is again first - order , with the entropy change @xmath212 .",
    "results for @xmath44 follow immediately by symmetry .",
    "in this paper , we have extended the definition of the farey fraction spin chain to include an external field @xmath0 . from rigorous and more heuristic arguments ,",

    ", we find for the renormalization group eigenvalues @xmath213 , and for the sub - leading eigenvalues @xmath214 and @xmath114 .",
    "we also examine a completely solvable model with very similar thermodynamics , but for which all phase transitions are first - order .",
    "we are grateful to j. l. cardy and m. e. fisher for useful suggestions .",

    "first we introduce some notation ( following @xcite ) .",
    "we use @xmath216 for the fractions ( called farey fractions ) , where @xmath217 is the order of the farey fraction in level @xmath21 .",
    "level @xmath218 consists of the two fractions @xmath219 . succeeding levels are generated by keeping all the fractions from level @xmath21 in level @xmath220 , and including new fractions .",
    "the new fractions at level @xmath221 are defined via @xmath222 and @xmath223 , so that + @xmath224 + @xmath225 + @xmath226 , etc .",
    "+ note that @xmath227 . when the farey fractions are defined using matrices ( spin states ) a and b , the level @xmath221 is the number of matrices in the chains starting with matrix @xmath2 and hence the length of the spin chain @xcite .",
    "note that the partition function ( [ pf ] ) is the sum of @xmath229 and @xmath230 , where the @xmath230 is the partition function for chains starting with the matrix @xmath3 .",
    "first we find bounds for @xmath229 and then prove a lemma which lets us apply the bounds for @xmath229 to @xmath230 also .    now ,",
    "when we go from level @xmath21 to level @xmath221 we double the number of the terms in the partition function .",
    "note that for chains starting with the matrix @xmath2 one half of the terms come from matrix products of the form @xmath231 and the others from products @xmath232 .",
    "it is easy to check that the corresponding traces for given @xmath233 are @xmath234 and @xmath235 , respectively .",
    "these traces are multiplied by an @xmath0 dependent factor @xmath236 which is simply @xmath237 raised to the power @xmath238 , the number of matices @xmath2 minus the number of matices @xmath3 in the particular chain . for the terms from products of the form @xmath231",
    ", it follows on using the definition of the farey fractions that @xmath239 and , similarly , for @xmath232 @xmath240 for the lower bound we just need the @xmath231 terms @xmath241 where we used the fact that @xmath242 .",
    "thus we get for @xmath243 @xmath244 for any @xmath46 and @xmath245          clearly the @xmath248 operation is a 1-to-1 map of the set of all chains @xmath259 onto @xmath260 .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic field term in the energy of each chain changes sign under this operation , so that the bounds just obtained for @xmath229 may be applied to @xmath230 . therefore @xmath261 note that the proof is easily adapted to the ksc model"
