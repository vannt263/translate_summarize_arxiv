    "the osiris imaging instrument on board the esa s rosetta spacecraft has revealed unexpected bedforms ( fig 1 and s1 ) on the neck of the comet 67p / churyumov - gerasimenko ( the hapi region ) @xcite and on both lobes ( maat and ash regions ) .",
    "several features suggest that these rhythmic patterns belong to the family of ripples and dunes @xcite .",
    "the bedforms present a characteristic asymmetric profile , with a small steep lee side resembling an avalanche slip face ( figs .",
    "1a , s1b ) and a longer gentle slope on the stoss side , which appears darker in fig .  1b .",
    "analysis of the available photographs show that their typical crest - to - crest distance is on the order of @xmath0  m ( tab .",
    "s1 ) , and that the surface is composed of centimeter scale grains @xcite ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "however , the existence of sedimentary bedforms on a comet comes as a surprise  it requires sediment transport along the surface , i.e. erosion and deposition of particles .",
    "when heated by the sun , the ice at the surface of comets sublimates into gas . as gravity is extremely small , @xmath1  m / s@xmath2 , due to the kilometer scale of the comet @xcite , the escape velocity is much smaller than the typical thermal velocity .",
    "outgassing therefore feeds an extremely rarefied atmosphere , called the coma , around the nucleus ( fig .",
    "this gas envelope expands radially .",
    "by contrast , ripples and dunes observed in deserts , on the bed of rivers and on mars and titan @xcite are formed by fluid flows parallel to the surface , dense enough to sustain sediment transport .",
    "the presence of these apparent dunes therefore challenges the common views of surface processes on comets and raises several questions",
    ". what could be the origin of the vapor flow exceeding the sediment transport velocity threshold @xcite ?",
    "how could the particles of the bed remain confined to the surface of the comet rather than being ejected into the coma ?",

    "outgassing takes place in the illuminated part of the comet @xcite . as ice sublimation requires an input of energy  the latent heat  the vapour flux is controlled by the thermal balance at the surface of the comet ( methods ) .",
    "the power per unit area received from the sun depends , at the seasonal scale , on the heliocentric distance and is modulated by the day - night alternation .",
    "the comet radiates some energy back to space with a power related to the surface temperature @xmath8 by stefan s law .",
    "finally , thermal inertia leads to a storage / release of internal energy over a penetration depth which is meter scale for seasonal variations and centimeter scale for daily variations .",
    "the vapor production rate from outgassing , defined as the product of the vapor density @xmath9 by the outward vapor velocity @xmath10 , has been measured for 67p at different heliocentric distances @xcite ( fig .",
    "common models assume that ice sublimation takes place at the surface and produces a radial flow at the thermal velocity @xcite .",
    "this would result in a density @xmath9 an order of magnitude smaller than that necessary to induce a fluid drag force large enough to overcome the threshold for grain motion ( as discussed below ) .",
    "we suggest that most of the vapor is emitted from sub - surface ice and must travel through the porous surface granular layer ( fig .",
    "sublimation makes the ice trapped in the pores recede , releasing unglued grains in surface that can be eroded .",
    "this process should lead to an ice level remaining at a constant distance from the surface , comparable to the grain size @xmath11 . using kinetic theory of gasses , we predict that for such vapor flow the outgassing velocity is ten times smaller than that of the spectacular vapor jets streaming from active pits @xcite ( methods ) .",
    "accordingly , the vapor atmosphere is ten times denser than previous estimates .",

    "at perihelion , we find that the pressure drops by ten orders of magnitude from day to night ( fig .",
    "s2**b * * ) .",
    "the comet s atmosphere therefore presents a strong pressure gradient that drives a tangential flow from the warm , high pressure towards the cold , low pressure regions , in a surface boundary layer ( methods ) .",
    "the extension of the halo of vapor on the dark side of the comet is a signature of this surface wind ( fig .",
    "it reverses direction during the day and is maximal at sunrise and sunset , with a shear velocity @xmath16 on the order of a fraction of the thermal velocity ( fig .",
    "the asymmetry between sunrise and sunset simply results from thermal inertia , as some heat is stored in the superficial layer during the morning and released in the afternoon .",
    "the vapor density in the coma is still at most seven orders of magnitude lower than that of air on earth .",
    "can a surface flow with such density and shear velocity entrain grains into motion ? the threshold shear velocity @xmath17 above which sediments are transported by a wind is quantitatively determined by the balance between gravity , hydrodynamic drag and cohesive contact force ( methods ) . investigating this balance",
    "highlights the need to apply findings from contact mechanics of rough interfaces @xcite to the study of small solar system bodies .",
    "the adhesive free energy , resulting from van der waals interactions , is proportional to the real area of contact between the grains , which is much smaller than the apparent one because of surface roughness .",
    "a realistic computation of this cohesion can be achieved under the assumption that contacts between grains are made of elastically deformed nano - scale asperities and that the apparent area of contact follows hertz law for two spheres in contact .",
    "the cohesive force is then found to scale as the maximal load experienced by the grains to the power @xmath18 ( methods ) @xcite .",
    "considering that this load is typically the weight of a surface grain , this force scales as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the grain bulk density , @xmath21 is the grain young modulus and @xmath22 is the surface tension of the grain material .",
    "it is therefore much lower than the force @xmath23 obtained for ideally smooth grains .",
    "importantly , the gravity force increases as @xmath24 , while the cohesive force increases as @xmath25 only .",
    "this allows us to define a cross - over diameter at which these two forces are comparable : @xmath26 .",
    "it gives the typical grain diameter below which cohesive effects become important and are responsible for the increase of the threshold at small @xmath11 ( fig .  5 ) . on earth , this diameter for natural grains is around @xmath27 m ( fig . s4**a * * ) . on 67p , making the simple assumption that the values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 are similar to those on earth ,",
    "the value of @xmath28 can be deduced from the gravity ratio to the power @xmath29 : @xmath30 .",
    "such a millimeter scale is three orders of magnitude smaller than the capillary length @xmath31  m suggested by traditional approaches , which ignore contact roughness @xcite .",

    "a second difference with earth is the large mean free path @xmath33 of the vapor molecules , which leads to a reduced drag force for grains smaller than @xmath33 ( supporting information ) .",
    "this explains that the threshold velocity @xmath17 , plotted as a function of the grain size @xmath11 ( fig",

    ", we find that , sufficiently close to perihelion , all these grains , and in particular those at the centimeter scale observed by rosetta near bedforms , can be transported by the afternoon thermal wind ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "importantly , this is only a small fraction of the time  typically @xmath45  s at perihelion , i.e. @xmath46 of the comet s day of @xmath47  h. the asymmetry between sunrise and sunset winds has an important consequence : the morning thermal wind is not strong enough to entrain grains .",
    "aeolian dunes and subaqueous ripples form by the same linear instability , which is now well modeled and quantitatively tested against laboratory measurements @xcite . the destabilizing effect results from the phase advance of the wind velocity just above the surface with respect to the elevation profile ( fig .",

    "photo credit : esa / rosetta / mps . ]    with the experience of terrestrial deserts , one can recognize the morphology of new born dunes whose crest - to - crest distance provides a good estimate of @xmath5 : they should be sufficiently young not to present a slip face but sufficiently old to be organized into a regularly spaced pattern . depending on the location ,",
    "the crest - to - crest distance is measured in the range @xmath51@xmath52  m ( tab .",
    "s1 ) . making an analogy with sediment transport processes on larger bodies  by transposing scaling laws established for saltation  , the analog of aeolian dunes @xcite would have an emergent wavelength of @xmath53  m due to the extremely large density ratio on the comet , i.e. much larger than the comet itself .",
    "similarly , using the comet s values , the analogue for aeolian ripples @xcite would produce a pattern of wavelength @xmath54  m. as the other elements ( asymmetric shape , granular bed , surface wind above transport threshold ) do point to bedforms of the dune family , we conclude that the cometary sediment transport is specific and is associated with a saturation length on the order of @xmath0  cm .",
    "given the very large density ratio @xmath55 between grains and vapor , the length needed to accelerate grains to the wind velocity is around @xmath56 km for centimeter scale grains .",
    "this is much larger than the comet size , meaning that the grains actually keep a velocity @xmath57 negligible in front of the wind velocity @xmath58 .",
    "the moving grains are thus submitted to an almost constant drag force equal to that when the grains are static .",
    "we then argue that the mode of sediment transport along the comet s surface is traction , where grains remain in contact with the substratum on which they roll or slide .",
    "traction is a slow mode of transport , where the energy brought by the flow is dissipated during the collision of moving grains with the static grains of the bed .",
    "sediment transport on the comet is therefore analogous to subaqueous bedload ( fig .",
    "s5 ) . adapting bagnold s approach to the comet ( supporting information )",
    ", the sediment flux is proportional to the product of the number of moving grains per unit surface and their mean horizontal velocity @xcite . in the subaqueous bedload case , because the density ratio @xmath55 is on the order of a few units ( in the range @xmath3@xmath59 ) , the moving grains quickly reach a velocity @xmath57 comparable to that of the fluid @xmath58 . on the comet , the constant mechanical forcing resembles , for the thin transport layer , a granular avalanche , in which dissipation comes from the collisions between the grains and is increasing with @xmath57 @xcite . in that case , close enough to the threshold , the grain velocity follows the scaling law @xmath60  m / s and the density of moving grains is a fraction of @xmath61 , which means that all the grains of this surface transport layer move .",
    "the corresponding volume sediment flux @xmath62 therefore scales as @xmath63 .    beside the separation of scales between @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    ", there are important differences with earth that prevent a cometary saltation @xcite in which the grains would move by bouncing or hopping @xcite .",
    "the flow is turbulent above a viscous sub - layer , typically @xmath64  m thick at perihelion , where turbulent fluctuations are damped by viscosity . after a rebound , grains with enough energy to reach the turbulent zone would be entrained into suspension , since the settling velocity is much smaller than turbulent fluctuations ( supporting information ) .",
    "these grains would acquire a vertical velocity larger than the escape velocity , on the order of a meter per second , and would eventually be ejected into the coma .     with the grain diameter @xmath11 at perihelion , for afternoon conditions .",
    "the minimal velocity above which sediment transport takes place is computed from the force balance on a grain between hydrodynamic drag , bed friction and van der waals cohesive forces ( methods ) .",

    "the displacement predicted by the linear stability analysis , on the order of @xmath0  m , ( fig .",

    "we have argued here that the bedforms observed on 67p are likely to be giant ripples , due to their composition , their asymmetric morphology and the existence of surface winds driven by the night / day alternation above the transport threshold .",
    "these conclusions are reached from a self - consistent analysis but are of course based on limited data . as bedforms reflect the characteristics of the bed and the flow they originate from , they provide strong constrains of the physical mechanisms at work , which challenge alternative explanations .",
