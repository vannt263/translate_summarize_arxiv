    "as is well known , the traditional approach of determining the fluctuation of single - particle occupation numbers fails for bosons as the temperature @xmath0 .",
    "it predicts that the fluctuation tends to infinity in this limit , rather than zero as described by a real system .",
    "after the experimental success in producing bose - einstein condensation of trapped alkali - metal atoms , there is renewed interest in calculating the number fluctuation using either canonical or microcanonical ensemble approach @xcite . most of these , however , use some forms of approximation to the real microcanonical fluctuation . in @xcite",
    "the authors define the so - called maxwell s demon ensemble , and calculate the microcanonical fluctuation for a 3d trap numerically . in @xcite",
    "we formulated a method of calculating the _ exact _ microcanonical fluctuation using combinatorics for a perfectly isolated bec with finite number of particles which , to our best knowledge , has not been presented before .    in this report",
    "we focus on a system of bosons in an one - dimensional harmonic trap .",
    "the number fluctuation of this system was calculated by the authors in @xcite , using the well - known asymptotic formulae from number theory to approximate the exact expansion coefficients of the n - particle partition function .",
    "their method yields results which were supposed to be _",
    "microcanonical_. however , we shall show in this brief report that their approximate method yields the same results one obtains from canonical ensemble averaging , or a related formulation by parvan _ et al _ @xcite . at low temperatures and for finite number of particles ( @xmath1 ) , these results are very different from the ones calculated using the _ exact _ combinatorics method .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section [ microcanonical ]",
    "we establish the notations and outline the method of calculating the _ exact _ ground state number fluctuation @xcite .",
    "section [ canonical ] contains the main focus of this brief report in which we derive the results of @xcite using thermodynamics , and show that they agree with the ones obtained from canonical method as given by @xcite .",
    "finally , we compare the exact combinatorics results from section [ microcanonical ] and the canonical results from section [ canonical ] .",
    "we consider an isolated system with discreet energy levels consisting of n particles in the ground state at zero temperature .",
    "given an excitation energy @xmath2 , there can be one particle which absorbs all the energy and gets excited to an excited state , or two particles which share the available energy ... etc .",
    "the number of excited particles @xmath3 can be somewhere between 1 and n , depending on the excitation quanta , such that the total number of particles @xmath4 remain constant .",
    "this defines the microcanonical ground state number fluctuation .",
    "denote @xmath5 to be the number of possible ways of distributing @xmath2 among _ exactly _ @xmath3 particles , then the probability of exciting _ exactly _ @xmath3 particles in a n - particle system at excitation energy @xmath2 is given by @xcite : @xmath6    expression ( [ probability ] ) is normalized and has the following properties : @xmath7    the moments of the probability distribution now read : @xmath8 the number of particles in the ground state @xmath9 and the excited states @xmath3 are related via @xmath10 . @xmath9 and @xmath3 are allowed to vary while @xmath4 is fixed so that the number fluctuation from the ground state is given by :    @xmath11    expression ( [ deltanzero ] ) is true in general regardless of the ensemble and statistics of the particles .",
    "next , we specialize to a one - dimensional harmonic trap .",
    "let us put @xmath12 , then the excitation energy from the ground state is @xmath13 .",
    "the partition function of the system is well - known @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "this is just the generating function pertaining to the restricted linear partitions of an integer n in number theory @xcite .",
    "expressing ( [ zn ] ) in power series of @xmath16 @xmath17    the coefficients @xmath18 is the number of partitions of n which have at most @xmath4 summands .",
    "for example , if @xmath19 and @xmath20 , then @xmath21 since @xmath22 . in connection to our system",
    ", @xmath18 is interpreted as the number of possible ways to distribute @xmath23 quanta among utmost @xmath4 particles . clearly , @xmath24 while the coefficients @xmath18 may be found analytically by expanding @xmath25 in series , the exact determination of the microstate @xmath5 is a difficult problem .",
    "we may find @xmath5 using combinatorics as described in detail in @xcite , or , alternatively , use the well - known identity @xcite @xmath26 using ( [ recursive ] ) , ( [ probability ] ) and ( [ deltanzero ] ) , the _ exact microcanonical _ ground state fluctuation may be determined .",
    "the ground state number fluctuation may in general be expressed in terms of the moments of occupation numbers as @xcite : @xmath27 the sum runs through all the allowed k values in the ground state defined at zero temperature . for bosons ,",
    "only @xmath28 state applies .",
    "canonically , the moments are given by : @xmath29~   x^{j \\epsilon_k}z_{n - j}(\\beta ) \\label{avnsqkx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we can also obtain the canonical fluctuation using a thermodynamics approach @xcite .",
    "given the n - particle partition function ( [ zn ] ) , the entropy of the system reads @xmath30 } -                 \\sum_{j=1}^n \\ln [ 1-x^{j } ]              ~\\nonumber \\\\             & = & \\beta e - \\sum_{j=1}^n \\ln [ 1-x^{j } ] \\label{ceentropy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the canonical multiplicity @xmath31 by definition is given by : @xmath32~=x^{-e } z_n(\\beta)~   \\label{thermalomega}\\ ] ] compare ( [ thermalomega ] ) with ( [ znexpansion ] ) , we see that the canonical multiplicity is a one - term approximation to the exact value of the expansion coefficients of the series ( [ znexpansion ] ) . to make a direct comparison with the results given in @xcite , we approximate the sums in ( [ ceentropy ] ) .",

    "@xcite which the authors claim give the microcanonical fluctuation .",
    "that the canonical method given by ( [ thermalfluct ] ) , ( [ avnkx ] ) , and ( [ avnsqkx ] ) and the above method are equivalent is shown in fig .",

    "the respective curves of both ensembles tend to agree as @xmath4 and @xmath23 get large ( _ ie .",
    "_  thermodynamic limit ) , otherwise the results are very different .    it is clear from the discussion above that the method employed by the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite yields _ canonical _ results . comparison between their method and the thermodynamics method makes it clear on why this is so : both use what essentially is a saddle point approximation to the exact multiplicity @xmath18 ( @xmath39 in their notation ) from the series ( [ zn ] ) . only when the multiplicity found exactly are the results microcanonical .",
