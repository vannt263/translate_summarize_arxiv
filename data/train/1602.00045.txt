    "typically , ( @xmath2-symmetric ) periodic solutions to one - parameter odes respecting the reversing symmetry appear as two - parameter families in which periodic solutions of constant period constitute a one - parameter subfamily ( cf .  definition [ def - reversible ] and theorem 4.3 from @xcite ) . local bifurcations of ( families of ) periodic solutions to parameterized reversible systems of odes have been studied intensively by many authors ( see @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for example , the reversible codimension - one hopf bifurcation in parameterized odes may occur as a result of a collision of eigenvalues of the linearization on the imaginary axis ( the so - called @xmath3-resonance ; see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "higher @xmath4 resonances , related to the case @xmath5 ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 are the eigenvalues at the moment of the bifurcation ) were studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the reversible hopf bifurcation scenarios , in this case , the purely imaginary eigenvalues move along the imaginary axis before and after the resonance . it should be pointed out that the eigenvalues moving along the imaginary axis may give rise to a bifurcation of periodic solutions of _ constant _ period even without any resonance ( see @xcite , section 8.6 , which is a starting point for our discussion ) .",
    "this bifurcation , considered in systems of functional differential equations respecting a finite group of symmetries , is the main _ subject _ of the present paper . as a by - product",

    "clearly , the second order system of odes @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a continuous function , can be considered as a prototypal example for ( parameterized families of ) reversible odes ( here @xmath31 .",

    "note that by replacing @xmath43 by @xmath44 in examples [ ex:1.2 - 1 ] and [ ex:1.2 - 2 ] , one obtains _ time - reversible _ fdes .",
    "however , such systems involve using the information from the future by `` traveling back in time '' , which is difficult to justify from a commonsensical viewpoint",
    ". therefore , in the present paper , we discuss only ( symmetric networks of ) space - reversible fdes ( one can think of equations governing steady - state solutions to pdes , cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . also , the natural source of space - reversibility is related to non - local interaction . a prototypal example for equation of type is related to diffusion process with two scales ( the local diffusion is modeled by the continuous laplacian while the non - local diffusion is related to the discrete laplacian ) . for the equations close in spirit to , we refer to @xcite . in this paper",

    "the equivariant degree is a topological tool allowing `` counting '' orbits of solutions to symmetric equations in the same way as the usual brouwer degree does , but according to their symmetry properties .",
    "in particular , the equivariant degree theory has all the needed features allowing its application in non - smooth / non - generic settings related to equivariant dynamical systems having , in general , infinite dimensional phase spaces . in the present paper , to establish the abstract results on the existence , multiplicity and symmetric properties of bifurcating branches of periodic solutions , we use the @xmath47-equivariant degree without free parameters , where @xmath48 is related to the reversing symmetry while @xmath45 reflects the symmetric character of the coupling in the corresponding network",
    ". we also present concrete examples related to @xmath1-symmetric coupling , for which the equivariant bifurcation invariant is fully evaluated . in order to achieve these computational goals",

    "<S> in this paper , we propose an equivariant degree based method to study bifurcation of periodic solutions ( of constant period ) in symmetric networks of reversible fdes . </S>",
    "<S> such a bifurcation occurs when eigenvalues of linearization move along the imaginary axis ( without change of stability of the trivial solution and possibly without @xmath0 resonance ) . </S>",
    "<S> physical examples motivating considered settings are related to stationary solutions to pdes with non - local interaction : reversible mixed delay differential equations ( mddes ) and integro - differential equations ( ides ) . in the case of @xmath1-symmetric networks of mddes and ides </S>",
    "<S> , we present exact computations of full equivariant bifurcation invariants . algorithms and computational procedures used in this paper are also included . </S>"
