    "interstellar magnetic fields were discovered already in 1932 by karl guthe jansky who first detected diffuse low - frequency radio emission from the milky way , but the explanation as synchrotron emission was given only in 1950 by karl otto kiepenheuer .",
    "the sensitivity of radio observations has improved by several orders of magnitude in the past decades , and synchrotron emission was detected from the interstellar medium ( ism ) in almost all star - forming galaxies , in galaxy halos and the intracluster medium , proving that a large fraction of the universe is permeated by magnetic fields . however , in spite of our increasing knowledge on interstellar magnetic fields , many important questions are unanswered , especially their first occurrence in young galaxies , their amplification when galaxies evolved , and their effect on galaxy dynamics .",
    "as magnetic fields need illumination by cosmic - ray electrons to become observable by synchrotron emission , which are generated in star - forming regions or intracluster shocks , we do not know yet whether magnetic fields also exist in radio - quiet elliptical or dwarf galaxies or in the general intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "progress can be expected from using faraday rotation which does not need cosmic rays , only magnetic fields and thin ionized gas .",
    "one of the research areas of the forthcoming radio telescopes ( lofar , askap , ska ) will be the search for faraday rotation in these objects against polarized background sources ( gaensler , this volume ) .",
    "the ska will also be needed to detect magnetic fields in young galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "most of what we know about galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields comes through the detection of radio waves . _",
    "zeeman splitting _  of radio spectral lines is the best method to directly measure the field strength ( heiles , this volume ) .",
    "the intensity of _ synchrotron emission _  is a measure of the number density of cosmic - ray electrons in the relevant energy range and of the strength of the total magnetic field component in the sky plane .",
    "polarized emission emerges from ordered fields .",
    "as polarization `` vectors '' are ambiguous by @xmath3 , they can not distinguish _ regular fields _ with a constant direction within the telescope beam from _ anisotropic fields _  which are generated from turbulent magnetic fields by compressing or shearing gas flows and frequently reverse their direction on small scales .",
    "unpolarized synchrotron emission indicates _",
    "turbulent fields_with random directions which have been tangled or generated by turbulent gas flows .",
    "the intrinsic degree of linear polarization of synchrotron emission is about 75% .",
    "the observed degree of polarization is smaller due to the contribution of unpolarized thermal emission , which may dominate in star - forming regions , by _ faraday depolarization _  along the line of sight and across the beam ( @xcite ) , and by depolarization due to variations of the field orientation within the beam and along the line of sight .    at short ( e.g. centimeter ) radio wavelengths the orientation of the observed @xmath4vector is generally parallel to the field orientation ,",
    "so that the magnetic patterns of many galaxies could be mapped directly ( @xcite ) .",
    "the orientation of the polarization vectors is changed in a magnetized thermal plasma by _",
    "faraday rotation_. the rotation angle increases with the plasma density , the strength of the component of the field along the line of sight and the square of the observation wavelength . as the rotation angle is sensitive to the sign of the field direction , only regular fields can give rise to faraday rotation , while anisotropic and random fields do not .",
    "for typical plasma densities and regular field strengths in the interstellar medium of galaxies , faraday rotation becomes significant at wavelengths larger than a few centimeters .",
    "measurements of the faraday rotation from multi - wavelength observations allow to determine the strength and direction of the regular field component along the line of sight . its combination with the total intensity and the polarization vectors can yield the three - dimensional picture of the magnetic field and allows to distinguish the three field components : _ regular , anisotropic and random_.",
    "the integrated flux densities of total radio continuum emission at centimeter wavelengths ( frequencies of a few ghz ) , which is mostly of nonthermal synchrotron origin , and far - infrared ( fir ) emission of star - forming galaxies are tightly correlated , first reported by @xcite .",
    "this correlation achieved high popularity in galactic research as it allows to use radio continuum emission as a extinction - free tracer of star formation .",
    "the correlation holds for starburst galaxies ( @xcite ) as well as for blue compact and low - surface brightness galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "it extends over five orders of magnitude ( @xcite ) and is valid to redshifts of at least 3 ( @xcite ) , so that radio emission serves as a star formation tracer in the early universe .",
    "only galaxies with very recent starbursts reveal significantly smaller radio - to - fir ratios because the timescale for the acceleration of cosmic rays and/or for the amplification of magnetic fields is longer than that of dust heating ( @xcite ) .",
    "strongest total synchrotron emission ( tracing the total , mostly turbulent field ) generally coincides with highest emission from dust and gas in the spiral arms : the correlation also holds for the local radio and fir or mid - ir ( mir ) intensities _ within galaxies _",
    "( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the highest correlation of all spectral ranges is found between the total intensity at @xmath56  cm and the mid - infrared dust emission , while the correlation with the cold gas ( traced by the co(1 - 0 ) transition ) is less tight ( @xcite ) .",
    "a wavelet cross - correlation analysis for m  33 showed that the radio  fir correlation holds for all scales down to 1  kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "the correlation breaks down below scales of about 50  pc ( @xcite ) and in radio halos , probably due to the smoothing effect on synchrotron intensity by cosmic - ray propagation .",
    "if the thermal and nonthermal radio components are separated with help of h@xmath6 and fir data ( e.g. within m  33 , @xcite ) , an almost perfect correlation is found between thermal radio and infrared intensities at all scales .",
    "the nonthermal  fir correlation is less pronounced but highly significant .",
    "the polarized synchrotron intensity , tracing the ordered field , is anticorrelated or not correlated with all tracers of star formation ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is not obvious why the nonthermal synchrotron and the thermal fir intensities are so closely related .",
    "the intensity of synchrotron emission depends not only on the density of cosmic - ray electrons ( cre ) , but also on about the square of the strength of the total magnetic field @xmath7 ( its component in the sky plane , to be precise ) .",
    "the radio  fir correlation requires that magnetic fields and star - formation processes are connected .",
    "if @xmath7 is strong , most of the cosmic - ray energy is released via synchrotron emission within the galaxy , the cre density decreases with @xmath8 and the integrated radio synchrotron luminosity depends on the cre injection rate , not on @xmath7 .",
    "if most thermal energy from star formation is also emitted within a galaxy via far - infrared emission by warm dust , this galaxy can be treated as a `` calorimeter '' for thermal and nonthermal emission .",
    "prime candidates for `` calorimeter '' galaxies are those with a high star - formation rate ( sfr ) . if @xmath7 increases with sfr according to @xmath9 , a linear radio  fir correlation for the integrated luminosities is obtained ( @xcite , b ) .",
    "however , the calorimeter model can not explain the local correlation within galaxies .    in galaxies with low or moderate sfr and @xmath7 , synchrotron lifetime of cre",
    "is sufficiently large to leave the galaxy . to obtain a global or local radio  fir correlation , coupling of magnetic fields to the gas clouds",
    "is needed .",
    "a scaling @xmath10 was proposed ( @xcite ) where @xmath11 is the average density of the neutral gas .",
    "a nonlinear correlation ( with a slope of about 1.3 ) between the nonthermal radio luminosity and the fir luminosity from warm dust is achieved by further assuming energy equipartition between magnetic fields and cosmic rays and a schmidt law of star formation ( @xmath12 ) ( @xcite ) . in this model the total magnetic field strength and the star - formation rate @xmath13 are related via @xmath14 .",
    "the radio  fir correlation indicates that _ equipartition_between the energy densities of the total magnetic field and the total cosmic rays is valid , at least on spatial scales larger than about 100  pc ( stepanov et al .",
    ", this volume ) and on timescales of larger than the cre acceleration time ( a few @xmath15 years ) .",
    "then the strength of the total magnetic field can be determined from the intensity of the total synchrotron emission , assuming a ratio @xmath16 between the numbers of cosmic - ray protons and electrons in the relevant energy range ( usually @xmath17 ) . in regions where electrons lost already a significant fraction of their energy , e.g. in strong magnetic fields or radiation fields or far away from their places of origin , @xmath16 is @xmath18 and the standard value of 100 yields an underestimate ( @xcite ) . on the other hand , in case of field fluctuations along the line of sight or across the telescope beam , the equipartition value is an overestimate ( @xcite ) .",
    "the typical average equipartition strength of the total magnetic field in spiral galaxies is about @xmath19 g .",
    "radio - faint galaxies like m  31 and m  33 , our milky way s neighbors , have weaker total magnetic fields ( about @xmath20 g ) , while gas - rich galaxies with high star - formation rates , like m  51 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : m51 ] ) , m  83 and ngc  6946 , have total field strengths of 2030  @xmath0 g in their spiral arms .",
    "the degree of radio polarization within the spiral arms is only a few % ; hence the field in the spiral arms must be mostly tangled or randomly oriented within the telescope beam , which typically corresponds to a few 100  pc .",
    "turbulent fields in spiral arms are probably generated by turbulent gas motions related to supernovae ( @xcite ) , stellar winds , spiral shocks ( @xcite ) or a small - scale turbulent dynamo ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mean energy densities of the magnetic field and of the cosmic rays in ngc  6946 and m  33 are @xmath21  erg  @xmath22 and @xmath23  erg  @xmath22 , respectively ( @xcite and this volume ) , about 10 times larger than that of the ionized gas , but similar to that of the turbulent gas motions across the whole star - forming disk .",
    "the magnetic energy possibly dominates in the outer disk of ngc  6946 .",
    "the strongest total fields of 50100  @xmath0 g are found in starburst galaxies , like m  82 ( @xcite ) and the `` antennae '' ngc  4038/9 ( @xcite ) , and in nuclear starburst regions , like in the centers of ngc  1097 and other barred galaxies ( @xcite ) . in starburst galaxies ,",
    "however , the equipartition field strength per average gas surface density is much lower than in normal spirals .",
    "this indicates strong energy losses of the cosmic - ray electrons , so that the equipartition field strength is probably underestimated by a factor of a few ( @xcite ) .",
    "this was recently confirmed by zeeman measurements of oh maser lines ( @xcite ) .    in case of energy equipartition ,",
    "the scale length of the total field in the disk of galaxies is at least @xmath24 times larger than the synchrotron scale length of typically 4  kpc ( where @xmath251 is the synchrotron spectral index ) .",
    "the resulting value of @xmath2616  kpc is a lower limit because the cre lose their energy with distance from the star - forming disk and the equipartition assumption yields too small values for the field strength .",
    "the galactic fields extend far out into intergalactic space .",
    "the same argument holds for the vertical extent of radio halos around galaxies which is also limited by cre energy losses .",
    "the dumbbell - shaped halo around edge - on galaxies like ngc  253 ( @xcite and this volume ) is the result of enhanced synchrotron and inverse compton losses in the inner region .    as proposed by @xcite",
    ", the magnetic field energy density may generally reach the level of global rotational gas motion and affect galaxy rotation in the outermost parts of spiral galaxies . at ghz frequencies",
    "the measured extent of the radio disks of galaxies is limited by energy loss of cosmic - ray electrons , so that measurements at low frequencies ( where energy losses are smaller ) are needed , e.g. with lofar ( @xcite ) .",
    "faraday rotation towards polarized background sources may allow to measure weak fields to even larger distances from the star - forming disks .",
    "the ordered ( regular and/or anisotropic ) fields traced by the polarized synchrotron emission are generally strongest ( 1015  @xmath0 g ) in the regions _ between _  the optical spiral arms , oriented parallel to the adjacent optical spiral arms . in some galaxies the field forms _ magnetic arms _  between the optical arms , like in ngc  6946 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n6946 ] ) .",
    "these are probably generated by a large - scale dynamo . in galaxies with strong density waves",
    "some of the ordered field is concentrated at the inner edge of the spiral arms , e.g. in m  51 ( @xcite ) , but the arm ",
    "interarm contrast of the ordered field is small , much smaller than that of the random field .    the ordered magnetic field forms spiral patterns in almost every galaxy ( @xcite ) , even in ring galaxies ( @xcite ) and in flocculent galaxies without an optical spiral structure ( @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the field lines generally do _",
    "not_follow the ( almost circular ) gas flow and need dynamo action to obtain the required radial field components .",
    "spiral fields with large pitch angles are also observed in the central regions of galaxies and in circum - nuclear gas rings ( @xcite ) .    in galaxies with massive bars",
    "the field lines follow the gas flow ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n1097 ] ) .",
    "as the gas rotates faster than the bar pattern of a galaxy , a shock occurs in the cold gas which has a small sound speed , while the flow of warm , diffuse gas is only slightly compressed but sheared .",
    "the ordered field is also hardly compressed .",
    "it is probably coupled to the diffuse gas and strong enough to affect its flow ( @xcite , fletcher et al .",
    ", this volume ) .",
    "the polarization pattern in spiral arms and bars can be used as a tracer of shearing gas flows in the sky plane and hence complements spectroscopic measurements .",
    "nearby galaxies seen edge - on generally show a disk - parallel field near the disk plane ( @xcite ) , so that polarized emission can also be detected from distant , unresolved galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "high - sensitivity observations of edge - on galaxies like ngc  891 ( @xcite ) and ngc  253 ( heesen et al . , this volume ) revealed vertical field components in the halo forming an x - shaped pattern ( krause , this volume ) .",
    "this is inconsistent with the predictions from standard dynamo models .",
    "the field is probably transported from the disk into the halo by an outflow emerging from the disk .",
    "the similarity of scale heights of radio halos in different galaxies indicates that the outflow velocity increases with the star - formation rate ( krause , this volume ) .",
    "interestingly , a recent model for global outflows from galaxy disks ( neglecting magnetic fields ) shows an x - shaped velocity field ( @xcite ) . improved outflow models including magnetic fields and dynamo action",
    "are needed .",
    "faraday rotation is a signature of regular ( coherent ) fields which could be generated by the mean - field ( or large - scale ) _ dynamo _ ( @xcite ; elstner , this volume ) .",
    "dynamo fields are described by modes of different azimuthal symmetry in the disk plane and vertical symmetry ( even or odd parity ) perpendicular to the disk plane .",
    "several modes can be excited in the same object . in flat , rotating objects like galaxy disks , the strongest mode s0 consists of a toroidal field of _ axisymmetric spiral _",
    "shape within the disk , without sign reversals across the equatorial plane , and a weaker poloidal field of quadrupolar structure with a reversal of the vertical field component across the plane .",
    "antisymmetric ( a  type ) fields are generated preferably in spherical objects like halos ( @xcite ) .",
    "the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) supports symmetric fields while primordial seed fields support antisymmetric fields ( @xcite ) .",
    "spiral dynamo modes can be identified from the pattern of polarization angles and faraday rotation measures ( rm ) from multi - wavelength radio observations of galaxy disks ( @xcite ) or from rm data of polarized background sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "the disks of a few spiral galaxies indeed reveal large - scale rm patterns , as predicted .",
    "the andromeda galaxy m  31 hosts a dominating axisymmetric disk field ( mode s0 ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : m31 ] and @xcite ) .",
    "other candidates for a dominating axisymmetric disk field are the nearby spiral ic  342 ( @xcite ) and the irregular large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetic arms in ngc  6946 can be described by a superposition of two azimuthal dynamo modes which are phase shifted with respect to the optical arms ( @xcite ) . however , in many observed galaxy disks no clear patterns of faraday rotation were found . either",
    "several dynamo modes are superimposed and can not be distinguished with the limited sensitivity and resolution of present - day telescopes , or the timescale for the generation of large - scale modes is longer than the galaxy s lifetime .",
    "dynamo models predict a rapid amplification of small - scale fields already in protogalaxies , while the generation of fully coherent large - scale fields takes several gyrs , depending on the galaxy size ( @xcite and this volume ) .",
    "furthermore , anisotropic fields dominate over dynamo modes if shearing gas flows are strong ( see sect .  4 ) .",
    "vertical fields as predicted by dynamo models should generate large - scale rm patterns around edge - on galaxies , but so far indication for an antisymmetric poloidal field was found only in the halo of ngc  253 ( heesen et al .",
    ", this volume ) .",
    "previous indirect evidence for symmetric fields from the dominance of inward - directed fields ( @xcite ) is no longer supported by the increased sample of galaxies .",
    "faraday rotation in the direction of qsos allows to determine the field pattern in an _ intervening galaxy _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "this method can be applied to much larger distances than the analysis of rm of the polarized emission from the foreground galaxy itself .",
    "faraday rotation of qso emission in distant , intervening galaxies revealed significant regular fields of several @xmath0 g strength ( @xcite ) which is a challenge for classical dynamo models ( @xcite ) .",
    "the recently developed method of _ rm synthesis _",
    ", based on multi - channel spectro - polarimetry , transforms the spectral data cube into a data cube of maps in faraday depth space ( @xcite , heald , this volume ) .",
    "rm components from distinct regions along the line of sight can be distinguished by their positions and widths in faraday depth .",
    "faraday screens appear as sharp lines , while emitting and rotating layers form broad structures in faraday depth .",
    "the transformation of faraday depth into geometrical depth ( _ faraday tomography _ ) needs modeling .",
    "surveys of the total synchrotron emission from the milky way yield equipartition strengths of the total field of 6  @xmath0 g near the sun and about 10  @xmath0 g in the inner galaxy ( berkhuijsen , in @xcite ) , consistent with zeeman splitting data of low - density gas clouds ( heiles , this volume ) . in the nonthermal filaments near the galactic center",
    "the field strength may reach several 100  @xmath0 g ( @xcite ) .",
    "milligauss fields were found in pulsar wind nebulae from the break in the synchrotron spectrum ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the observed degree of radio and optical polarization in the local galaxy implies a ratio of ordered to total field strengths of @xmath27 ( @xcite ) . for a total field of 6  @xmath0 g",
    "this gives 4  @xmath0 g for the local ordered field component ( including anisotropic fields ) .",
    "faraday rm and dispersion measure data of pulsars give an average strength of the local coherent regular field of @xmath28 g ( @xcite ) . in the inner norma arm ,",
    "the average strength of the coherent regular field is @xmath29 g ( @xcite ) .",
    "the all - sky maps of polarized synchrotron emission at 1.4  ghz from the milky way from drao and villa elisa and at 22.8  ghz from wmap , and the new effelsberg rm survey of polarized extragalactic sources were used to model the large - scale galactic field ( @xcite ) .",
    "one large - scale reversal is required about 12  kpc inside the solar radius , which also agrees with the detailed study of rms from extragalactic sources near the galactic plane ( @xcite , kothes & brown , this volume ) .",
    "recent pulsar rm values indicate reversals at several galactic radii ( han , this volume ) .",
    "none of the models for a simple large - scale field structure of the milky way survived a statistical test ( @xcite ) . similar to external galaxies , the milky way s regular field probably has a complex structure which can be revealed only based on a larger sample of pulsar and extragalactic rm data .",
    "rms of extragalactic sources and of pulsars reveal no large - scale reversal across the plane for galactic longitudes l=90@xmath30270@xmath30 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sun ] ) : the local disk field is part of a large - scale symmetric ( quadrupolar ) field structure .",
    "however , towards the inner galaxy ( l=270@xmath3090@xmath30 ) the rm signs are _ opposite _  above and below the plane ( fig .  [",
    "fig : sun ] ) .",
    "this may indicate a global antisymmetric mode in the halo ( @xcite ) , similar to the results for the spiral galaxy ngc  253 ( heesen et al .",
    ", this volume ) .",
    "note that a superposition of a disk field with even parity and a halo field with odd parity can not be explained by classical dynamo theory ( @xcite ) .",
    "while the large - scale field is much more difficult to measure in the milky way than in external galaxies , galactic observations can trace magnetic structures to much smaller scales ( @xcite , reich & reich , this volume ) .",
    "small - scale and turbulent field structures are enhanced in spiral arms compared to interarm regions , as indicated by the different slopes of their _ rm structure functions _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "the all - sky and the galactic plane polarization surveys at 1.4  ghz ( reich & reich and landecker et al .",
    ", this volume ) reveal a wealth of structures on pc and sub - pc scales : filaments , canals , lenses and rings .",
    "their common property is to appear only in the maps of polarized intensity , but not in total intensity . some of these are artifacts due to strong depolarization of background emission in a foreground faraday screen , called _ faraday ghosts _ , but carry valuable information about the turbulent ism ( @xcite ) .",
    "faraday rotation in foreground objects ( e.g. supernova remnants , planetary nebulae , pulsar wind nebulae or photo - dissociation regions of molecular clouds ) embedded in diffuse polarized galactic emission may generate a _ faraday shadow _  or _ faraday screen _  which enable to estimate the regular field strength by modeling the radiation transfer ( @xcite , reich & reich , this volume ) .",
    "future radio telescopes will widen the range of observable magnetic phenomena .",
    "high - resolution , future deep observations at high frequencies with the extended very large array ( evla ) and the square kilometre array ( ska ) ( gaensler , this volume ) will directly show the detailed field structure and the interaction with the gas .",
    "the ska will also measure the zeeman effect in much weaker magnetic fields in the milky way and nearby galaxies .",
    "forthcoming low - frequency radio telescopes like the low frequency array ( lofar ) and the murchison widefield array ( mwa ) will be suitable instruments to search for extended synchrotron radiation at the lowest possible levels in outer galaxy disks , halos and clusters , and the transition to intergalactic space . at low frequencies",
    "we will get access to the so far unexplored domain of weak magnetic fields in galaxy halos ( @xcite ) .",
    "the detection of radio emission from the intergalactic medium will allow to probe the existence of magnetic fields in such rarified regions , measure their intensity , and investigate their origin and their relation to the structure formation in the early universe .",
    "low frequencies are also ideal to search for small faraday rotation from weak interstellar and intergalactic fields .",
    "`` cosmic magnetism '' is the title of key science projects for lofar and ska ."
