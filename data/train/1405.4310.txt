    "the most violent stellar explosions are the sources of most of the heavy elements on earth , and supernovae ( sne ) in particular are estimated to occur at a rate of @xmath3 per century in our galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "it is inevitable that , over the course of geological time , some such explosions will have occurred within @xmath4 pc of the earth , close enough to have deposited some ejecta on the earth and moon ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the question then arises whether some closer astrophysical explosion might have left detectable traces on the earth itself in the form of geological isotope anomalies .",
    "moreover , with a closer astrophysical explosion , the possibility for biological damage , even a mass extinction arises ( for recent references , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "discussions of this possibility date back to the pioneering study of @xcite .",
    "these authors discovered an iridium anomaly associated with the cretaceous - tertiary transition that they argued could not , in fact , be associated with a sn explosion , but instead with a giant impact .",
    "subsequently , @xcite surveyed possible isotope signatures of a nearby sn explosion , including 26 , 53 , 60 , and 244 .",
    "motivated by this study , @xcite searched for an anomaly in the 60 abundance in a deep - ocean ferro - manganese ( fe - mn ) crust , and found one that appeared @xmath2 myr ago .",
    "although primordial solar system composition shows enrichment from extra - solar origins , to our knowledge , this is the first such specific extra - solar event to be identified . following the @xcite discovery ,",
    "its interpretation was discussed in @xcite and possible corroborating isotope signatures were discussed in @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that the event arose in the sco - cen ob association , which was @xmath9 pc away at the time of the 60-producing event .",
    "@xcite presented hydrodynamic models for the sn blast impact with the solar wind , and @xcite highlighted the importance of the ejecta condensation into dust grains .    the 60 signal has subsequently been confirmed in another fe - mn crust sample @xcite and in lunar regolith @xcite , but no other accompanying isotope anomaly has been found in studies of 26 abundances @xcite .",
    "searches for 244 have produced just a single count , albeit with no stable isobar background @xcite .    in this paper , we broaden our previous analyses in four ways . in a first step , we provide yields for isotopes from the ccsne considered previously and extend our analysis to include the cases of ecsne , tnsne ( also known as a type ia sn ) , kne ( also known as neutron star mergers ) , and sagbs , which have not been considered previously in this context . for this paper , we distinguish between ecsne and the more massive ccsne since there are qualitative differences in the collapse and explosion mechanism as well as nucleosynthesis of these two classes .",
    "secondly , we revisit the formalism surrounding the deposition calculations , including the impact and some geology of the uptake factor , and also the possibility of using sediments to get time - resolved signals and give predictions for these profiles .",
    "we also discuss the filtering processes impacting the transport of the signal via dust .",
    "next , we discuss the compatibility between the terrestrial and lunar evidence for a 60 anomaly , and we also analyze the existing limits on the 26 abundance from samples bracketing the 60 anomaly . in combination with these previous steps , as a fourth and final step , we survey the possible interpretations of the 60 anomaly and make predictions for upcoming measurements .",
    "we find that a tnsn and a kn would yield too little 60 , and can be ruled out as possible sources for the @xcite 60 signal .",
    "additionally , we find a sagb source constrained , but not eliminated due to uncertainty in the local bubble s magnetic field and the location of a possible sagb source .",
    "ccsne from our set of masses and ecsne can not be ruled out based on the available measurements .",
    "previous papers have focused on ccsne as the likeliest progenitor for the 60 signal . however , there are other astrophysical ejections that are thought to produce 60 but have not been considered previously .",

    "although known to be sources of stable iron isotopes , tnsne are calculated to produce relatively little 60 , namely @xmath76 , according to the w7 type ia model of @xcite . ecsne form a special subcategory of ccsne with significantly different radioactive isotope yields . while the 60 yields for ccsne and ecsne are similar ( @xmath77 , * ? ? ?",

    "sne can show large variations in their isotope yields .",
    "tnsn 60 yields show variations over several orders of magnitude ( @xmath81 ) due to variations in the number and location of ignition points and the transition from deflagration to detonation @xcite . ,",
    "which is consistent with the classic w7 result @xcite and is larger than almost all @xcite models . ]",
    "ccsne / ecsne yields are highly dependent on a number of factors including when different layers are mixed .",
    "this can be seen in the variations of yields from one mass to another @xcite .",
    "the yields within a given mass are also subject to uncertainties in nuclear reaction rates ( 3-@xmath7 and @xmath82c(@xmath7,@xmath83)@xmath84o ) which can lead to an almost order of magnitude shift in the production of 26 and 60 @xcite . in ",
    "[ sect : results ] , figure [ fig : dist ] , we show the calculated distances with uncertainties indicated by dashed lines for a factor of 5 variation in the 60 yield for each ccsn / ecsn type .",
    "fiducial parameters for the explosions and the interstellar medium are chosen as follows : we assume ccsne and tnsne deposit @xmath85 ergs into their ejecta , while ecsne deposit @xmath86 ergs @xcite . because the local bubble shows evidence of multiple sn explosions , we will assume that if a sn were the source of the 60 signal , it would be the most recent sn , meaning the sn occurred in an already depleted ism , but not as depleted as the current density of the local bubble ( i.e. , @xmath87 ) .",
    "therefore , we estimated a sn would have occurred in an ism of density , @xmath88 , temperature , @xmath89 k , and sound speed , @xmath90 km s@xmath91 ( i.e. , approximate values for the local cloud , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "we only consider the kn explosion s lower - energy , spherical / torical ejection and not its highly beamed gamma - ray burst jet .",
    "the rapid decompression and ejection of neutron - rich ns matter makes these events a natural site for the @xmath80-process @xcite . while kne are less energetic than sne ( @xmath92 ergs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we will consider a possible kn source of the 60 signal as occurring in the same ism conditions as a sn .",
    "however , given the axisymmetric nature of ns - ns mergers , we will not apply the same constraints to kne as sne , but will instead evaluate kne with respect to isotope yields and frequency .    while there has been some modeling of kn yields , none we are aware of",

    "however , it is possible to determine an upper limit on the range for a kn . in @xcite",

    "[ sect : results ] , figure [ fig : dist ] . in contrast to sne , we do not expect a sagb wind to affect the density of the local bubble appreciably , and we assume that a sagb source for the 60 signal would have occurred in an ism like that found in the local bubble today ( i.e. , @xmath101 , temperature , @xmath102 k , and sound speed ,",
    "@xmath103 km s@xmath91 ) . finally , we assume the initial velocity of the sagb grains to be : @xmath104 .",
    "regardless of the source , any 60 arriving in the solar system will need to be in the form of dust .",
    "@xcite showed that the solar wind will keep any gaseous isotopes from reaching the earth ( unless a sn is sufficiently close , but this will be used as a constraint later in ",
    "[ sect : snprof ] and  [ sect : results ] ) .",
    "we assume that the dust grains are spherical and select as our fiducial values for dust grains : density , @xmath105 ( an average value for silicates ) , radius , @xmath106 ( this selection is based on discussion in  [ sect : dust ] ) , and voltage , @xmath107 .",
    "departures from these values will be specifically stated .",
    "in order to identify the most likely progenitor , we will attempt to constrain the source and its allowable distances using the measured 60 fluence and calculated yields . in the future , with additional measurements of other isotopes , we can use the other isotope yields to constrain the source using the observed isotope to 60 ratio .",
    "several previous works have presented the formalism for calculating deposited material from a sn @xcite .",
    "these works focused primarily on short ranges ( sn distances , @xmath108 pc ) and on the isotope 60 . for such short distances , the losses due to decay of live radionuclides en route from the sn to earth amount to @xmath109 and can be ignored . at greater ranges ( @xmath110 pc ) and for shorter - lived isotopes ( in particular , 26 with @xmath111 = 0.717 myr ) decays en route become a significant issue . accounting for this , the observed fluence today , @xmath112 , for each isotope , @xmath113 , in atoms per area on the surface of the earth within a given substance ( e.g. , crust , sediment , etc . )",
    "becomes : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the mass of the ejecta by isotope , @xmath116 is the distance from the progenitor to earth , @xmath117 is the atomic number of the isotope , @xmath118 is the atomic mass unit , @xmath119 is the time from today since the ejecta arrived at earth , and @xmath120 is the time the ejecta traveled from the source to earth . also , @xmath121 is the mean lifetime of the isotope ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "the uptake , @xmath123 , is the fraction of the isotope deposited on a surface that is collected by that material .",
    "the quantity is dimensionless , and ranges from 1 ( the material collects 100% of deposited element ) to 0 ( the material collects 0% of deposited element ) .",
    "if , for example , a marine sample can chemically scavenge the element of interest so efficiently that it collects more than the amount deposited in the water column directly over the sample . ]",
    "it is further discussed in  [ sect : uptake ] .",
    "additionally , the dust fraction , @xmath124 , is the amount of the isotope in the form of dust that arrives at earth (  [ sect : dust ] ) .",
    "it is similar to uptake in that it is also dimensionless and ranges from 1 ( all of the isotope is in the form of dust and reaches earth ) to 0 ( none of the isotope is dust and/or reaches earth ) .",
    "there is a factor of @xmath125 from the ratio of the earth s cross sectional to surface areas , because it is assumed material is distributed evenly over earth s entire surface through collisional accretion only .",
    "equation ( [ eq : ntotobs ] ) also assumes an isotropic dispersal of material from the source ( @xmath126 factor for spherical distribution ) , that no additional isotopes are created after the ejection from the progenitor , and that the ejected material passes through a homogeneous ism .",
    "there are three other fluence quantities that appear in the literature : `` decay - corrected '' fluence , `` surface '' fluence , and `` interstellar '' fluence .",
    "the decay - corrected or arrival fluence , @xmath127 , is the total number of atoms per area that would have been measured at the time the signal arrived .",
    "it is calculated by correcting our previous description of fluence ( see equation ( [ eq : ntotobs ] ) ) for radioactive decay since the isotope was deposited @xmath128 .",
    "the surface fluence or global mean fluence , @xmath129 , is the total number of atoms per area that arrive at the surface of the earth regardless of what substance they might be incorporated into , and is found by dividing the decay - corrected fluence by the uptake ( i.e. , @xmath130 ) .",
    "it will be used in  [ sect : data ] and  [ sect : results ] and will be specifically stated when used .",
    "the interstellar fluence , @xmath131 , also appears in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , namely the number of atoms per area on the surface of the spherical shock front .",
    "it is related to the surface fluence by a factor of 4 , the ratio of earth s cross section to surface area ( i.e. , @xmath132 ) .",
    "interstellar fluence will not be used in this paper , but the reader should be aware of the distinction when reviewing the literature .    in order to find the time delay , @xmath120 , from ejection to deposition on earth , we must account for the propagation of the ejection through the intervening ism , which depends on the progenitor .",
    "sne transmit material via an explosive shock , whereas sagbs use a wind - driven ejection . in the case of sne",
    ", we will assume that the shock has transitioned from the free - expansion phase into the adiabatic / energy - conserving phase .",
    "for sagbs , we will assume dust has been blown by winds from the star and experiences drag as it travels to earth .      for sne in the adiabatic / energy - conserving phase , the shock follows a self - similar or sedov - taylor expansion profile . with the explosion at time @xmath133 ,",
    "a shock is launched with radius , @xmath134 , at elapsed time , @xmath135 , given by : [ eq : sedov ] = _ 0 ^1/5 for a sn explosion depositing energy @xmath136 into the ejecta , propagating into a local interstellar medium of density @xmath137 . the quantity @xmath138 is a dimensionless constant that is of order unity for @xmath139 using the derivation in @xcite .",
    "thus the time interval to traverse distance , @xmath116 , is : @xmath140 where we have assumed a uniform ism density . while we know this is a crude approximation ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , deviations from the uniform case would be encoded into the signal and could be determined if the signal is time - resolved ( for examples of non - uniform media , see * ? ? ?",
    "we use the uniform ism case as a baseline .",
    "the density versus radius profile for a sn signal may be approximated by a `` saw - tooth '' profile . as will be described in greater detail in ",
    "[ sect : raddist ] ,  [ sect : timesig ] , and appendix [ sect : appendix ] , measurements in sediment open the possibility to making time - resolved fluence measurements .",
    "a saw - tooth pattern gives a better approximation of the more exact sedov solution than a uniform shell profile .",
    "the saw - tooth pattern reaches its maximum density value at the outer edge of the shock , then decreases linearly to a fraction of the total shock radius , @xmath141 , where the density is zero from that point to the center of the remnant .",
    "see appendix [ sect : appendix ] for a comparison of the exact sedov , saw - tooth , and uniform shell profiles .",
    "possible sne will be constrained by an inner `` kill '' distance and an outer `` fadeaway '' distance .",
    "the kill distance is the range at which a sn can occur and create extinction - level disruptions to the earth s biosphere . the primary mechanism for a sn to accomplish this is for ionizing radiation ( i.e. , gamma - rays , hard x - rays , and cosmic - rays ) to destroy o@xmath142 and n@xmath143 in the atmosphere producing nitric oxides ( no@xmath144 ) and leaving the biosphere vulnerable to uvb rays from the sun ( first described by * ?",
    "* described in detail by @xcite , and updated by @xcite ) .",
    "this can be accomplished either by direct exposure ( i.e. , an x - ray flash from the sn ) or by a `` descreening '' boost in cosmic - ray flux .",
    "@xcite calculated a kill distance @xmath145 pc for the direct exposure case using the galactic gamma - ray background and sn rates , although , as pointed out by @xcite , this is probably an underestimation based on more recent rate estimations .",
    "this work was expanded upon by @xcite and @xcite to include x - rays and showed that for exposure durations up to @xmath146 s , the effects on the biosphere were the same and that the critical value for an extinction - level sn event was an energy fluence of @xmath147 ( not to be confused with the description of fluence used throughout the rest of this paper ) .",
    "as noted in @xcite , these direct exposure calculations use sn rate and photon and cosmic - ray emission information that are improving , but still subject to large uncertainties .    here",
    "we calculate the kill distance using the descreening case described in @xcite ; it yields the same range as the direct exposure calculations , and is scalable to the energy of the sn , @xmath136 .",
    "the descreening kill distance is the range at which a sn can occur and its shock will penetrate the solar system to within 1 au of the sun . it is determined by setting the solar wind pressure , @xmath148 , equal to the pressure of the sn shock ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case , the pressure from the sn has little effect on the earth , but by pushing back the solar wind , the earth is inside the sn remnant and now directly exposed to the sn cosmic - rays that would normally diffuse out over @xmath149 yr @xcite in addition to an increased galactic cosmic - ray background . in - turn , these destroy o@xmath142 and n@xmath143 in the atmosphere , just as in the direct exposure case , in addition to increased radionuclide deposition @xcite . using our fiducial sn values ,",
    "we find : r_kill = 10  pc  ( ) ^1/3 ( ) ^1/3    the fadeaway distance is the range at which the sn shock dissipates and slows to the sound speed of the ism .",

    "we approximate the density profile for a sagb signal by a uniform shell or `` top - hat '' shape ( we will use `` top - hat '' profile to avoid confusion with the sn profile discussion ) .",
    "this corresponds to a uniform , steady wind .",
    "the top - hat pattern reaches its maximum density value at the leading edge of the signal , retains this value for the duration of the signal , and afterwards the density returns to zero .",
    "the sagb phase is characterized by thermal - pulsing of the star s envelope . since the duration of each pulse ( @xmath164 yr ) and interval between pulses ( @xmath165 yr )",

    "when the transit time ( the time for the shock to travel from the source to earth ) is negligible ( @xmath171 ) , the procedure is straightforward , since the only distance dependence is the inverse square dilution of the ejecta , and so @xmath172 .",
    "this has been assumed in work to date .",
    "however , if @xmath116 is sufficiently large , then via equation ( [ eq : sedov ] ) , the distance - dependent transit time can become important and must be included in solving equation ( [ eq : ntotobs ] ) ; we have done this in all of our results .",
    "another effect occurs when the radioisotope signal is sampled sufficiently finely to resolve the time history of the deposition signal .",
    "this occurs when the signal width ( the time from the arrival of the signal s leading edge to the departure of the signal s trailing edge ) is larger than the sampling time resolution ( @xmath173 ) . in this case",
    ", the total radioisotope signal , summed over all time bins , should be used in solving the distance via equation ( [ eq : ntotobs ] ) ; and as we show in  [ sect : timeresolv ] below , the width of @xmath174 for a sn probes independently the explosion distance .",
    "however , the available @xcite data has a time sampling of @xmath175 kyr , and shows no evidence for a signal that is extended in time .",
    "thus we infer that the signal width @xmath176 , and indeed we find @xmath177 kyr for most of our possible progenitors .",
    "in addition , when solving for distance using the knie results , we assumed the signal arrived halfway through the sample .",
    "therefore , half of the sampling width is used as a median value rather than assuming the signal arrives right as the sampling window begins or just before it ends .",
    "although the time resolution of the deep - ocean 60 crust measurements in @xcite data preclude resolution of the time structure of the radioisotope deposition , measurements in sediments can achieve much better time resolution , and so it is of interest to explore the time dependence of the explosion signal .",

    ", we examine a sedov - taylor profile for a sn shock ( a similar examination could be done for the sagb case if we had more detailed description of its signal width dependence ) , which implies an energy - conserving ( adiabatic ) evolution .",
    "this also means the shock will remain self - similar as it progresses and that the majority of the material is concentrated near the leading edge . although the remnant density profile changes once the remnant transitions to the radiative / momentum - conserving phase , we have chosen to maintain the sedov profile .",
    "we did this , firstly , because the profiles are similar in shape ( the radiative profile is a thicker shell profile , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "17.4 ) . secondly , because the dust will decouple from the gas at some point , either when the shock meets back pressure from encountering the solar wind or at the transition from the adiabatic to the radiative phase when the shock loses its internal radiation pressure @xcite .",
    "the exact nature of this decoupling and resulting profile would require detailed calculations that are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we assume that the explosion ejecta are well - mixed within the swept - up matter , so that the ejecta density profile follows that of the blast itself .",
    "as described in appendix [ sect : appendix ] , we approximate the sedov density profile as a `` saw - tooth '' that drops linearly from a maximum behind the shock radius @xmath134 to zero at an inner radius @xmath179 , with @xmath180 .",
    "we note that the leading edge of the blast from an event at distance @xmath116 arrives at a time @xmath120 since the explosion which corresponds to geological time @xmath119 ; this is given by @xmath181 , whereas the trailing edge of the shell arrives at time @xmath182 given by @xmath183 .",
    "thus we have @xmath184 .    with these assumptions we can model the global - averaged flux time profile , @xmath185 . for radioisotope @xmath113 , we have : [ eq : timeprof ] _ i(d , t ) = ^-11/5   _ i(d , ) as shown in appendix [ sect : appendix ] ; note that here all times are geological and thus increase towards the past . )",
    "time increases towards the future , but note that elsewhere , unless explicitly stated , times are used in the geological sense , and thus increase towards the past . ]",

    ", the time endpoints should obey @xmath184 , which provides a consistency check for the sedov ( adiabatic ) approximation .",
    "moreover , as we show in  [ sect : timeresolv ] , the interval @xmath189 provides an independent measure of the explosion distance .",
    "if the radioisotope abundance is sampled over a time interval @xmath190 $ ] , then the fluence ( without radioactive decays ) will be the integral of the surface flux over this interval : @xmath191 , where we have suppressed the dependence on time - independent parameters such as distance .",
    "if the observed time resolution @xmath192 is small compared to @xmath187 and @xmath182 , then the fluence profile @xmath193 will recover the flux history .",
    "so far we have calculated the observed fluence without the effect of decay . since",
    "all the atoms were created at the same time , the observed fluence is reduced by a factor @xmath194 .",
    "the effects of uptake (  [ sect : uptake ] ) and dust depletion (  [ sect : dust ] ) introduce further factors of @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "we thus arrive at the observed fluence : [ eq : nresolved ] f_obs , i(t_1,t_2 ) = u_i f_i e^-(+)/_i _",
    "i(t )  dt  .",
    "one can show that the total integrated fluence @xmath197 takes precisely the value in equation ( [ eq : ntotobs ] ) .",
    "this reflects the number conservation ( aside from decays ) of the atoms in the sn ejecta .",
    "this also implies that , in a time - resolved measurement , the total fluence is conserved , which means that the area under a fluence vs. time curve will be constant for fixed explosion parameters .",
    "this implies that fluence measurements of 60/fe will show lower values when measured over fewer bins , and finer sampling will show higher fluence over more bins ( see figure [ fig : timeres ] ) .      a time - resolved signal not only encodes information about the shape of the blast density profile , but also about the distance .",
    "the relation @xmath183 also allows us to write @xmath184 and thus that : = - where we define a dimensionless parameter , @xmath7 , that relates the signal width in terms of the arrival time . for our profile , @xmath198 .",
    "we see that the radioisotope width grows in proportion to the blast transit time to earth , @xmath120 , which itself depends on distance .",
    "thus a measurement of @xmath174 from a time resolved radioisotope signal gives an measure of the explosion distance . within this sedov model , @xmath181 , and",
    "so we can solve for the distance based on `` blast timing : '' [ eq : dblast ] d & = & _ 0 ^1/5 + & = & 65  pc  ^2/5  ^1/5",
    "^1/5    this distance measure is independent of the `` radioactivity distance '' and its associated uncertainties , notably due to uptake , dust fraction , and radioisotope yields .",
    "moreover , as characteristic for sedov blast waves , the blast - timing distance in equation ( [ eq : dblast ] ) scales as small powers of the timescale , as well as the energy and density .",
    "this will weaken the uncertainties in distance estimate .    having two independent distance estimates",
    "allows a consistency check for the model .",
    "alternatively , if we adopt one of the distance estimates as the correct value , we can deduce the parameters in the other .",
    "for example , adopting the blast - timing distance we can use the observed fluence and solve for the product of radioisotope yield , uptake , and dust fraction : @xmath199 . given a geophysical estimate of uptake ,",
    "this allows for a measure of the yield and thus a direct probe of the nucleosynthesis output and thus the nature of the explosion ( see figure [ fig : timeres ] for examples ) .",
    "the delivery of astrophysical debris to the solar system and its incorporation into geological and lunar samples is clearly complex . in this section",
    "we consider several factors we are aware of that can have a substantial influence on the observed signals .",
    "uptake in the fe - mn crust involves a complex chemical process that incorporates material into the crust with a low accumulation rate @xmath200 mm myr@xmath91 .",
    "usual deep - ocean sediments , on the other hand , do not make such a geochemical selection , and have greater accumulation rates @xmath201 mm kyr@xmath91 @xcite .",
    "the fe uptake factor was calculated by @xcite using the relative concentrations of fe and mn in water and the fe - mn crust and the uptake of mn ( 4% ) , leading to an estimate for the fe uptake , @xmath202 .",
    "however , recent studies have suggested that @xmath203 @xcite . using the smaller estimate of @xmath204",
    ", @xcite calculated a sn distance of @xmath205 ; a reasonable distance considering the local bubble is @xmath93 pc in diameter in the galactic plane extending 600 pc perpendicular to the plane @xcite and superbubbles in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) are typically @xmath206 pc in diameter ( for a single round of star formation , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "changing the uptake factor has the immediate effect of changing the implied distance to the explosion .",
    "this can be roughly understood",
    "if we ignore the effect of the debris decays in transit , in which case the signal follows the inverse square law and we have @xmath207 .",
    "the effect of decays en route softens this dependence somewhat .    if @xmath204 is an order of magnitude larger , the implied distance increases by a factor @xmath208 . with a fe - mn crust uptake factor of @xmath209 ,",
    "the implied distances are around @xmath210 pc .",
    "this seems an unlikely distance , given that the solar system is roughly in the center of the local bubble ( see * ? ? ?",
    "2 ) , and a sn would have had to occur outside the local bubble in order to produce the signal ( assuming the progenitor is in the galactic plane ) .    however , implicit in the @xcite calculation is the assumption that the dust fraction , @xmath211 . as we will show in  [ sect : dust ] , this is most likely not the case , and the combination of a higher uptake value ( we chose @xmath212 ) with a smaller dust fraction ( @xmath213 ) can still yield reasonable progenitor distances .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , that for a sn further than @xmath108 pc , the solar wind would keep the sn blast plasma outside of 1 au , and thus the earth will not find itself inside gas - phase sn debris . however , refractory sn ejecta will be condensed into dust grains . as discussed in @xcite , we expect these grains to be entrained in the sn blast as it reaches the heliosphere , but then decouple at the sn - solar wind shock and move essentially ballistically through the inner solar system .",
    "once the dust decouples from the gas in the shock , it can travel great distances . at this point ,",
    "both sne and sagbs behave the same , as they are subject to the same drag stopping distance , @xmath168 discussed in ",
    "[ sect : sagbprof ] .",
    "this is more than sufficient to reach the earth in spite of the solar wind , and indeed should carry dust grains beyond the sn remnant when it finally comes to rest .",

    "we would expect dust grains with a sufficiently high velocity ( i.e. , @xmath243 ) to ignore size filtering limitations , but including these effects will be left for a future work .",
    "the primary data value for our analysis is the decay - corrected 60 fluence measured by @xcite in a deep - ocean fe - mn crust .",

    "@xcite suggested several reasons for the non - detection in the sediment , including differences in uptake and divergences in the sediment from the global background .",
    "in addition , we note that the fluence calculation assumes an even distribution of dust over the earth s surface",
    ". however , the earth s wind patterns are not uniform , nor is earth s precessional axis necessarily orthogonal to the progenitor s position .",
    "consider , for example , a spherical dust grain of radius 0.2 @xmath226 m falling at terminal velocity ( @xmath251 m s@xmath91 ) through a 1500 m - thick jet stream flowing horizontally at 100 km hr@xmath91 with a density of @xmath252 g @xmath253 ( the assumption of falling at terminal velocity should be valid as the earth s atmosphere will have dissipated most of the dust grain s remaining interstellar kinetic energy ) . as the dust grain falls",
    ", the pressure from the jet stream will quickly accelerate the grain horizontally to the same velocity and push the grain @xmath6 km before it falls out of the jet stream . in view of the non - uniformity of the jet stream s flow as well as other terrestrial winds , anisotropies in the observed fluences",
    "are expected .",
    "furthermore , one should also consider the source s orientation to the earth s precessional axis ; the fe - mn crust used by @xcite is from 9@xmath25418 n , 146@xmath25403 w ( @xmath255 mi/1,600 km se of hawaii ) , and the sediment used by @xcite is from 66@xmath25456.5 n , 6@xmath25427.0 w ( @xmath5 mi/400 km nw of iceland ) .",
    "the crust sample s location relative to the equator would make it more likely to receive a signal over a range of arrival angles while the northern hemisphere could be partially shielded from a more southerly progenitor .",
    "rather than the fe - mn crust signal being due to a misinterpretation of the global background , the absence of a sediment signal could be due to the geometry of the source s position .",
    "if this is the case , a sediment sample from the southern hemisphere ( e.g. , elt49 - 53 , 38@xmath25458.7 s , 103@xmath25443.1 e and elt45 - 21 , 37@xmath25451.6 s , 100@xmath25401.7 e used by @xcite ) should have an 60 signal .",
    "in addition to sea sediment and fe - mn crusts , lunar surface ( regolith ) samples can also be used to search for a nearby progenitor signal .",
    "the lunar surface is not affected by wind or water erosion , but , as pointed out by @xcite , the sedimentation rate is low ( precluding the possibility of time - resolved measurements ) and regular impacts by a range of impactors @xcite , continually churn up the regolith , mixing different levels .",
    "lunar samples would be better suited to providing a `` first hint '' of a signature @xcite .",
    "apollo core samples were analyzed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ; in particular , these authors found both the apollo 12 sample 12025 and apollo 15 sample 15008 to have an 60 signal above the background . @xcite and @xcite found that the apollo 12 and 15 cores , respectively , showed little to no large - scale mixing just prior to , during , and/or since the potential arrival of the signal , meaning no large impactor could have ejected part of the regolith thus diluting the signal .",
    "however , as we show in the next section , another issue arises with the dust s arrival at the moon s surface that can dilute the signature .",
    "as noted above , there are putative detections of a non - meteoric 60 lunar anomaly , which seem to verify the presence of the deep - ocean signal ; an amazing confirmation . however , having argued that the 60 will arrive in the form of high - velocity dust grains , we now consider the implications for the deposition onto the lunar surface .",
    "@xcite made a detailed study of impacts on the lunar regolith and found semi - empirical fits to the volume of vapor produced as a function of impactor size and velocity and of the target composition .",
    "it was found that impactor velocity is the dominant factor and that , for @xmath256 km s@xmath91 , the volume of target material that is vaporized is @xmath257 times the volume of the impactor itself .",
    "more recently , @xcite showed that micrometeor impacts can be a non - negligible source of the lunar vapor atmosphere .",
    "they use the @xcite model and find that `` the contribution may be 8% of the photo - stimulated desorption at the subsolar point , becoming similar in the dawn and dusk regions and dominant on the night side . ''",
    "moreover , @xcite did laboratory experiments to simulate micrometeorite impacts , studying the neutral gas created as a result .",
    "they find that the number of neutrals produced per unit impactor mass scales as @xmath258 , and they conclude that complete vaporization is expected for speeds exceeding 20 km s@xmath91 .    with these results in mind ,",
    "we now consider the conditions surrounding the arrival of the dust signal in question at the lunar surface . after entering the solar system ,",
    "the dust grains continue to the earth / moon at essentially the same speed . however , whereas the earth s atmosphere slows the arriving dust grains prior to reaching the surface , the moon s tenuous atmosphere has practically no influence , and the dust grains velocities are unchanged before arrival at the lunar surface .",
    "the dust grains are estimated to be @xmath259 m in size , and moving at @xmath260 km s@xmath91 depending on the progenitor s distance .",
    "thus the grains behave as `` micrometeorites '' moving at very high speeds similar to those examined above .",
    "consider a silicate dust grain ( @xmath261 ) impacting the lunar surface ( @xmath262 ) at @xmath263 .",
    "the grain arrives with kinetic energy @xmath264 , where @xmath265 is the mass of a spherical grain of radius @xmath266 .",
    "the dust grain will penetrate the regolith to a depth comparable to its diameter and will vaporize some of the surrounding material ; we will assume @xmath267 .",
    "given the grain s high speed and shallow penetration , the vaporization will happen quickly ( i.e. , very little expansion occurs before the entire mass is vaporized ) .",
    "moreover , since the initial density of the vaporized regolith is much greater than the density of the moon s atmosphere , the gas will behave as if it is expanding isentropically into a vacuum .",
    "the grain s kinetic energy will go into vaporizing the grain and regolith and into the thermal and kinetic energy of the resulting gas . to determine the vaporization energy , the standard enthalpy of formation for the lunar regolith is @xmath268 .",
    "this is an approximate value for both of the lunar regolith s main constituents , silica , sio@xmath143 , and aluminum oxide , al@xmath143o@xmath142 , @xcite , and includes both the vaporization and dissociation energies for the molecules .",
    "therefore , the total energy consumed in vaporization is 0.1 ergs , leaving 0.13 ergs for the thermal and kinetic energy , @xmath269 , of the gas .",
    "as the gas expands , the thermal portion vanishes asymptotically , with all the energy becoming kinetic .",
    "thus , after this cooling , the asymptotic expansion speed of the vaporized material is : v _ = 6  km  s^-1 .",
    "the vapor speed is much larger than the lunar escape velocity , @xmath270 km s@xmath91 .",
    "this suggests that much of the vaporized material , including the dust impactor with its 60 material , would escape from the moon .",
    "this would imply that the moon has an uptake factor @xmath271 .",
    "thus , we should not be surprised that the lunar results for 60 are lower than expected naively from the terrestrial fe - mn crust results .",
    "while lunar samples confirm the signal found in the fe - mn crust , they are less suitable for determining the fluence given the difficulties in determining @xmath272 .",
    "several searches for live 244 have been performed , beginning with @xcite looking at fe - mn nodules .",
    "studies of top layer sea sediment by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have shown there is a very low background in 244 , making 244 an excellent candidate to confirm an 60 signal from an extra - solar source ( presumably from a ccsn ) .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of a single 244 atom in the same fe - mn crust sample used by @xcite and @xcite covering the entire time interval of @xmath273 myr .",
    "separately , @xcite looked in sea sediment for a 244 signal , but did not find any evidence for a signal .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the raisbeck study was using the previous arrival time ( 2.8 myr ago ) for his search .",
    "the samples were dated using magnetic polarization analysis and did not cover a large enough time interval to include the appropriate dating interval using the new value for the 10 lifetime @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported on searches for 10 and 26 using @xmath274 kyr time intervals in samples from sea sediments elt 49 - 53 and elt 45 - 21 . in the case of 26",
    ", the measurements showed only variations consistent with fluctuations around the background level , and found no evidence for an extra - solar signal .",
    "the paper also reported that 53 measurements are planned .",
    "in figure [ fig:60fe ] we compare our model predictions with the 60 data of @xcite and @xcite , showing that the model matches the results within the uncertainties for a sn or sagb occurring 2.2 myr ago .",
    "we note that the sampling was continuous through the entire data range , and straddled the signal arrival .",
    "in addition , the value for the 880-kyr time resolution was less than the 440-kyr sample , as expected due to the additional stable fe in the wider sample .",
    "using the decay - corrected @xcite fluence of 60 (  [ sect : fe60terr ] ) , and 60 yields from various source candidates (  [ sect : progenitors ] ) , we have solved equation ( [ eq : ntotobs ] ) for the distance to the source .",

    "this is an implausibly short distance , and any uncertainty in the fluence measurement would not change this determination . at that range",
    ", the tnsn would have killed nearly all life on earth , so we can exclude a tnsn as the source of the 60 signal ( in this case , the descreening kill distance for a tnsn is @xmath28910 pc and the ionizing radiation kill distance from 10@xmath290 ergs of @xmath83-rays is @xmath28920 pc , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "our calculations give a possible kn distance of @xmath293 pc . of the little that is known observationally or even theoretically about kne",
    ", we are unaware of any estimates of their ionizing radiation output . in addition",
    ", the strength and shape of the shock from ejected material is highly dependent on the orientation of the merger .",
    "thus , we are unable to estimate the corresponding kill distance either by direct exposure or descreening .",
    "the ejecta from kne are certainly energetic ( explosive velocities @xmath294 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and one might imagine decompressing neutron star matter initially emitting in the uv or at shorter wavelengths .",
    "however , the observed radiation for the kn candidate associated with grb 130603b is very red at times @xmath295 hours @xcite .",
    "moreover , while the kn shock and radiation is expected to be much more isotropic than the grb , more study of the geometry of the resulting blast is needed to determine a definitive kill distance like that used for tnsn .",
    "consequently , a biohazard argument can not rule out a kn explosion as the source of the 60 anomaly .    however , a much better discriminator for a kn source would be the 244/60 ratio . the single 244 atom detected by @xcite yields a surface fluence of @xmath296 atoms @xmath235 for the period @xmath273 myr ago .",
    "looking at the yields from @xcite again , we can infer the yield for @xmath297 should be at least on the order of the yield for @xmath94 ( i.e. , @xmath298 ) .",

    "this makes a kn an unlikely source for the 60 signal .",
    "however , this result should be revisited as specific yields for 60 become available and especially if a signal from strong @xmath80-process isotopes is detected ( e.g. , 146 , 182 , and 244 ) .",

    "all sagbs lie well within the distance for dust stopping due to drag ( @xmath313 kpc ) but well outside the magnetic deflection distance ( @xmath310 pc ) . while it is tempting to rule out sagbs as a source under the assumption that any dust would be quickly deflected , we have decided to not rule out sagbs ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) since there is uncertainty in the strength , direction , and uniformity of the local bubble s magnetic field .",
    "depending on the nature of the local bubble s magnetic field , charged dust particles could travel with very little deflection .",
    "instead , we will be examining an alternate search in a future work .      in figure",
    "[ fig : al26 ] , we plot 26 predictions for various progenitors , and the expected background in the accelerator mass spectrometry ( ams ) data from @xcite using the same 3-kyr sampling intervals used in this experiment .",
    "because @xmath314 , we do not expect any signal to be present if the source were a sn . the calculated signal from a 15-@xmath10 ccsn with @xmath315",
    "is plotted simply as an example if the dust fraction was significantly higher . additionally ,",
    "while we would expect some al from sagbs to reach earth , it would not be visible above the variations in the 26 background .      in anticipation of ams",
    "53 measurements mentioned by @xcite , in figure [ fig : mn53 ] we plot predictions for 53 based on the distance determined by the 60 fluence . since the survival and grain size for mn from a sn has not been described to our knowledge , we plotted a range of sn progenitors ( since sagbs are not expected to produce 53 ) and dust fractions , using the largest possible signal source ( 21-@xmath10 ccsn ) , a mid - range source ( 15-@xmath10 ccsn ) , and the lowest source ( ecsn ) .",
    "we varied the dust fraction from an order of magnitude above to an order of magnitude below @xmath316 .",
    "as can be seen for the 15- and 21-@xmath10 ccsn with @xmath317 , a signal should be readily detectable the given the ams detection threshold of @xmath318 53/55 @xcite .",
    "however , for the ecsn and most ccsne with @xmath319 ( even a 21-@xmath10 case could be difficult to detect depending on the fluctuations in the 53/55 background ) , it should be improbable for a sn progenitor to be detected with 53 .",
    "since the discovery and confirmation of the terrestrial 60 signal by @xcite and @xcite , several experiments have tried to find a corroborating signal either in lunar samples or with other isotopes . to date , none of these experiments provided a definitive signal on the order of that originally reported .",
    "this paper attempts to provide a context for these observations and seek other possible progenitors besides a ccsn whose properties could be consistent with the observations .",
    "we also anticipate future observations with a hope for time - resolved signals .    from our list of candidates , we can rule out a tnsn as it would be too close ( @xmath288 pc ) to both create the 60 signal and to not kill most life on earth .",
    "we also rule out a kn as a potential source .",
    "the kn would have been @xmath293 pc away from the earth , and while more study of the geometry of a kn is required to determine a definitive kill distance , the low amount of 244 ( a strong @xmath80-process element ) detected to date contrasted with the high number of @xmath80-process elements per merger makes a kn a low probability . additionally , kne / neutron star mergers are very rare , making it unlikely for the solar system to have passed within 5 pc of one .",
    "although sagb stars are outside the magnetic field deflection distance , we have decided to not rule out sagb stars based solely on this stipulation .",
    "depending on the strength , direction , and uniformity of the local bubble s magnetic field and the charge on the dust grains , it may be possible for a sagb to have produced the measured 60 signal . since a sagb would likely have evolved to the white dwarf stage by now , we plan to investigate this possibility in a future work .",
    "all variations of ccsne and ecsn remain possible sources . of these",
    ", ecsn would be the most likely , firstly , because they arise from the lowest - mass and thus most common core - collapse progenitors . additionally , @xcite listed members of the sco - cen association and their masses ( using their listed magnitudes and mass - to - magnitude relation ) which included the range : @xmath320 , compared to @xmath321 .",
    "since more massive stars evolve faster than lower - mass stars , it is reasonable to expect the signal progenitor to be near the upper end of the mass range .",
    "lastly , the continued lack of a definitive 244 signal , in spite of multiple attempts , is also consistent with the possibility of an ecsn as the progenitor due to its lack of strong @xmath80-process products .",
    "several caveats are important to bear in mind .",
    "probably most importantly , our ability to test different explosion candidates is only as good as the radioactive yield predictions .",
    "these challenging calculations are continually improving , but are subject to significant uncertainties , including stellar evolution , hydrodynamics , and nuclear physics .",
    "indeed , two key nuclear cross sections alone can lead to 60 and 26 yield variations by factors up to @xmath304 @xcite .",
    "this alone suggests that all of the ccsn candidates should be revisited as yields improve .",
    "@xcite showed that tnsn yields are sensitive to the number of initiation sites and the transition from deflagration to detonation .",
    "clearly , improved radioisotope yield calculations for any of our explosive sources could dramatically change the landscape of possible scenarios .",
    "thus , we implore future nucleosynthesis studies to include ( at least ) 60 and the other radioisotopes we have discussed here .",
    "other important uncertainties similarly invite future work .",
    "as we have seen , fe uptake in fe - mn crusts represent another topic that invites future study .",
    "uptake has a dramatic impact on our results : the inferred distance to the explosion scales as @xmath322 .",
    "additionally , the local interstellar density and magnetic field plays a key role in the propagation of the signal ( whether from a sn or sagb ) and in the duration of the time profile of the radioisotope flux .",
    "finally , as we have seen , the observability of different radioisotopes is highly sensitive on the formation and survival of supernova dust of different compositions and sizes .",
    "we have relied on theoretical calculations @xcite which imply , among other things , that 26 is unlikely to be observable terrestrially despite its sn abundance comparable to 60 .",
    "further such theoretical studies relevant to other radiosotopes , and observational corroboration , are critically needed .    to confirm the origin of the 60 signal and pin down its source will require measurements of 60 at other sites , other sources ( e.g. , magnetosomes in addition to crust and sediment ) , and other radioisotopes .",
    "lunar regolith measurements provide unique confirmation of the terrestrial 60 signal",
    ". however , we find absolute measurements will be difficult because high - velocity dust vaporizes on the lunar surface and much of the incident material will then escape the moon .",
    "this said , we eagerly await detailed presentation of lunar measurements hinted at by @xcite .",
    "we are also looking forward to 53 measurements as mentioned by @xcite and 244 measurements by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see wallner , et al .",
    "2014 , citation therein ) that will be helpful in discriminating between the remaining possible progenitors .    looking ahead to further measurements , the behavior of dust condensation , survival , and filtering will be a key factor in narrowing the remaining pool of possible progenitors .",
    "the dust fraction includes several filtering processes that can all affect the resulting distance calculation ( @xmath323 ) .",
    "studies of dust formation have focused on silicates , iron , and corundum , but formation processes with other elements ( especially mn , ca , ti , zr , tc , and pu ) could be used to differentiate the remaining possibilities given the varying yield ratios between these elements for each progenitor .",
    "the search for other isotopes is not simply a matter of choosing those with high lifetimes ( @xmath324 ) , but also those with low backgrounds , high condensation temperatures ( in order to form dust grains ) , and large grain sizes ( @xmath325 ) .",
    "of particular interest would be 41 and 53 .",
    "while perhaps not ideal candidates with regards to background levels , they have long lifetimes and can be condensed at high temperatures ( @xmath326 k ) into perovskite ( catio@xmath142 ) , melilite ( ca@xmath143al@xmath143sio@xmath327 , ca@xmath143mgsi@xmath143o@xmath327 ) , and alabandite ( mns ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "other possible isotopes with long lifetimes such as 93 , 97 , 99 , and 107 , as well as strong @xmath80-process elements such as 146 , 182 and 244 could be used to constrain ccsne if more details of their dust condensation are determined , but , regardless , any other candidate isotope would need to form grains large enough to survive escape from its progenitor and enter the solar system .",
    "it would be a remarkable coincidence if the only isotope that is capable of carrying an extra - solar signal ( i.e. , 60 ) is the first one examined .    with observations of additional isotopes ,",
    "it is possible not only to identify a specific event or progenitor , but also to : ( 1 ) provide a better measure of the distance to the source , ( 2 ) directly probe individual radioisotope nucleosynthesis , ( 3 ) constrain the nearby sn rate , ( 4 ) guide astrophysical searches for the sn remains ( i.e. , pulsars ) , and ( 5 ) model the explosion light curve and to assess the possible damage to the terrestrial biosphere .",
    "finally , we have seen that the measurement of time - resolved radioisotope profiles provides direct information of the blast passage through the solar system and an independent measurement of the distance to the progenitor .",
    "the authors are optimistic that new data will make such questions tractable in the near future .    since our first submission",

    "we model astrophysical explosions as spherically symmetric , and we are interested in distances sufficiently large that the swept up interstellar mass is much larger than the ejecta mass .",
    "we treat a blast wave as adiabatic ( energy - conserving ) and thus adopt the sedov - taylor solution .",
    "the sedov blast wave evolves in a self - similar manner .",
    "this means in particular that gas properties as a function of radius @xmath80 maintain the same shape when plotted in terms of the similarity variable : @xmath389 where the shock radius at @xmath135 is given by equation ( [ eq : sedov ] ) . in particular , the density profile is : @xmath390 where the density immediately behind the shock is : @xmath391 and the dimensionless density profile function is thus normalized to @xmath392 .",
    "note that mass conservation implies that the total mass @xmath393 swept up in the blast is equal to the total mass in the blast profile : @xmath394 and so setting @xmath395 implies that : [ eq : massint ] _ 0 ^ 1 x^2  g(x )  dx = =    we consider two approximations to the full sedov profile . for a uniform shell approximation , we have @xmath396 for @xmath397 $ ] and zero otherwise , which gives the location of the inner shell radius via : @xmath398 and thus : @xmath399 whereas going to first order in @xmath335 we would find @xmath400 . for a `` saw - tooth '' approximation ,",

    "as seen in figure [ fig : sedov - approx ] , the saw - tooth density profile more closely matches the exact sedov density profile compared to the uniform shell profile , making the saw - tooth profile more appropriate for modeling the signal spreading for our sn distances .",
    "the ( radial ) velocity profile is : @xmath405 with @xmath406 the shock speed , and the dimensionless velocity profile function normalized to @xmath407 . to a good approximation , the velocity is linear , and we will adopt the approximation @xmath408 .",
