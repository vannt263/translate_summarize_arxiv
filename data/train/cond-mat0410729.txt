    "<S> sensitivity to initial conditions in the coherent noise model of biological evolution , introduced by newman , is studied by making use of damage spreading technique . </S>",
    "<S> a power - law behavior has been observed , the associated exponent @xmath0 and the dynamical exponent @xmath1 are calculated . </S>",
    "<S> using these values a clear data collapse has been obtained .    _ </S>",
    "<S> pacs number(s ) : 89.75.da , 05.90.+m , 91.30.-f _    </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that there is an increasing interest in extended dynamical systems exhibiting avalanches of activity , whose size distribution is scale - free . some examples of such systems can be enumerated as earthquakes @xcite , rice piles @xcite , extinction in biology @xcite , evolving complex networks @xcite , etc . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is no unique and unified theory for such systems . </S>",
    "<S> one of the possible candidates is the notion of self - organize criticality ( soc ) @xcite . in soc models , </S>",
    "<S> the whole system is under the influence of a small driving force that acts locally and these systems evolve towards a critical stationary state having no characteristic spatio - temporal scales . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> it is known from literature @xcite that another kind of simple and robust mechanism is available in order for producing scale - free behavior . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism is based on the notion of external stress coherently imposed on all agents of the system . </S>",
    "<S> since the model does not contain any direct interaction among agents , it does not exhibit criticality . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it yields a power - law distribution of event size . </S>",
    "<S> these so - called coherent noise models have been firstly introduced to describe large - scale events in evolution , but then they were used as a model of earthquakes @xcite and its aftershock properties @xcite as well as aging phenomenon in the model @xcite have been analysed .    </S>",
    "<S> the coherent noise models can be defined as follows : firstly we consider a system , which has @xmath2 agents . </S>",
    "<S> each agent @xmath3 has a threshold @xmath4 against external stress @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the threshold levels are chosen randomly from some probability distribution @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the external stress is also drawn randomly from another distribution @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> an agent is eliminated if it is subjected to the stress @xmath5 exceeding the threshold for this agent . </S>",
    "<S> algorithmically , dynamics of the model can be given by three steps : ( i )  at each time step , generate a random stress @xmath5 from @xmath7 , eliminate all agents with @xmath8 and replace them by new agents with new thresholds taken from @xmath6 , ( ii )  select a small fraction @xmath9 of the @xmath2 agents at random and assign them new thresholds , ( iii )  go back to ( i ) for the next time step . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth mentioning that step ( ii ) corresponds to the probability for the @xmath9 fraction of the whole agents of undergoing spontaneous transition , which is a step necessary for preventing the model from grinding to a halt @xcite .    in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the sensitivity to the initial conditions of the coherent noise models using damage spreading technique . </S>",
    "<S> this technique can be thought as a method which is borrowed from dynamical systems theory in the following sense : if we consider two copies of the same one - dimensional dynamical system starting from slightly different initial conditions and follow their time evolution , we can define the sensitivity function    \\(t ) _ </S>",
    "<S> x(0)0 = e^t to quantify the effect of initial conditions </S>",
    "<S> . here , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the distances between two copies at @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively , and @xmath14 is the lyapunov exponent . if @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , the system is said to be _ strongly sensitive _ </S>",
    "<S> ( _ strongly insensitive _ ) to the initial conditions . for the marginal case , where @xmath17 , the form of the sensitivity function could be a whole class of functions . for the low - dimensional discrete dynamical systems , </S>",
    "<S> this form is found to be a power - law    \\(t ) ~t^ . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath18 and @xmath19 cases correspond to _ weakly sensitive _ and _ weakly insensitive _ to the initial conditions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the high - dimensional dynamical systems , like the bak - sneppen model or like the one that we discuss in this work , the same analysis could be performed using the hamming distance instead of the sensitivity function . as in the case of low - dimensional systems </S>",
    "<S> , one can classify the sensitivity by looking at the behavior of the hamming distance    d(t ) = _ </S>",
    "<S> i=1^n | x_i^(1)(t ) - x_i^(2)(t)| , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are two slightly different copies of the system under consideration . in this way , </S>",
    "<S> up to now , various variants of the bak - sneppen model have been analysed and related exponents are calculated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our aim here is to make the same analysis for the coherent noise models to numerically obtain the dynamical exponents of the model .    to proceed further </S>",
    "<S> let us define the procedure . </S>",
    "<S> we start the simulations from a uniform threshold distribution , which means that the system starts from an initial event of infinite size that spans the whole system . </S>",
    "<S> this is considered to be the first copy of the system ( namely , @xmath20 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in all simulations , we use the exponential distribution for the external stress    p_stress ( ) = a^-1 ( - ) ( a>0 ) ,    and the uniform distribution @xmath6 @xmath22 for the threshold level . the second copy ( namely , @xmath21 ) </S>",
    "<S> is generated by exchanging the values of two randomly chosen sites . </S>",
    "<S> then the dynamics of the model , as explained above , is applied for both copies of the system using always the same set of random numbers to update them . to investigate the properties of sensitivity to initial conditions of the model , we follow the temporal evolution of the hamming distance given in eq.(3 ) . in all cases , we use a large number of realizations to reduce the fluctuations and the given results , namely @xmath23 , are the ensemble averages over these realizations . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 it is easily seen that the damage spreads as a power - law , indicating a weak sensitivity to initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the power law growth @xmath24 with @xmath25 is followed by a plateau with a constant value , starting at a certain time depending on the system size . </S>",
    "<S> this saturation is due to the fact that by this measure one can not identify that both copies have converged to the same random sequence .     </S>",
    "<S> time evolution of the normalized hamming distance for five different system sizes . for the largest one ( @xmath26 ) </S>",
    "<S> the exponent of the power - law growth is estimated as @xmath27 the number of realizations used for averaging is 200 for @xmath26 and 400 otherwise . for a better visualization logaritmic binning </S>",
    "<S> is employed to all data sets . ]    the second important exponent , called as the dynamical exponent @xmath1 , comes from the scaling of @xmath28 , which is defined to be the value of @xmath13 where the power - law increasing part crosses over onto the saturation regime . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , @xmath29 is the value of @xmath13 at the intersection point of two straight lines , one of which comes from the power - law curve and the other from the constant plateau . </S>",
    "<S> then , the scaling @xmath30 defines the dynamical exponent @xmath1 , which is obtained from fig .  2 as @xmath31 .     </S>",
    "<S> double log plot of @xmath29 versus @xmath2 for each curve given in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> from this scaling we estimate the dynamical exponent as @xmath32 . ]    as a final step , we analyse the finite size scaling behavior of the model . </S>",
    "<S> to accomplish this task , we define the normalized hamming distance as    d(n , t ) = and numerically verify that it obeys the scaling ansatz    d(n , t ) = n^ f ( ) , with @xmath33 , which comes from @xmath34 and @xmath35 . a clear data collapse can easily be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that the results presented here do not depend on the choice of the numerical value of the model parameter @xmath36 and/or the fraction @xmath9 . in our simulations we use @xmath37 and different @xmath9 values for each system size in order to assure only one agent </S>",
    "<S> is eliminated in step ( ii ) to reduce the computational time .     </S>",
    "<S> data collapse of the finite size scaling given in eq.(6 ) for the same system sizes used in fig .  1 and fig </S>",
    "<S> .  2 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> summing up , we have studied the sensitivity to initial condition properties of the coherent noise models using damage spreading technique . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the model exhibits weak sensitivity to initial conditions , a property which is common for other high - dimensional dynamical systems like bak - sneppen model and its variants as well as one- and two - dimensional discrete systems like logistic map families . </S>",
    "<S> the numerically obtained values of the power - law exponent @xmath0 and the dynamical exponent @xmath1 are appeared to be different from those of the bak - sneppen model , which signals out the discrepancy between the universality classes of these models . </S>"
