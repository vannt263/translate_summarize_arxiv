    "before the launch of _ fermi _ @xmath0ray space telescope , our understanding of @xmath0ray pulsars was very limited .",
    "its predecessor _ compton _ gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) has only detected seven pulsars in mev - gev regime throughout its almost nine years life - time ( thompson 2008 ) . among them",
    ", there is a special member , geminga ( psr  j0633 + 1746 ) , which was the only known radio - quiet @xmath0ray pulsar in the pre-_fermi _ era ( see bignami & caraveo 1996 for a review ) .    with its much improved sensitivity and accurate source localization , the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard _",
    "fermi _ has expanded the @xmath0ray pulsar population considerably shortly after its operation ( abdo et al .",
    "2009a , b ) .",
    "16 new @xmath0ray pulsars have been discovered through blind searches with just @xmath1 month data ( abdo et al .",
    "currently , there are 205 @xmath0ray pulsars have been detected by lat .    in the second _ fermi _ lat pulsar catalog ( 2pc abdo et al .",
    "2013 ) , the detailed properties of 117 pulsars detected at energies @xmath2  mev with three years data are reported .",
    "it comprises 42 radio - loud pulsars , 35 radio - quiet pulsars and 40 millisecond pulsars ( abdo et al .",
    "2013)jy ] .",
    "establishing radio - quiet @xmath0ray pulsars as a definite class is one of the triumphs of _ fermi_. different from the radio - loud cases , they can only be detected through blind pulsation searches at high energies .",
    "apart from the high sensitivity of lat , the expansion of radio - quiet pulsar population also thanks to the improvement of searching techniques ( e.g. kerr 2011 ) .    about 30@xmath3 of the known @xmath0ray pulsars",
    "are radio - quiet . taking the selection effects into account",
    ", this fraction can be even larger .",
    "sokolova & rubtsov ( 2016 ) have estimated that the intrinsic fraction of radio - quiet @xmath0ray pulsars can be as large as @xmath4 .",
    "such large fraction of radio - quietness imposes strict constraints on the geometry and mechanism of the pulsar emission .",
    "this implies the @xmath0rays are originated from the outer magnetosphere and form a fan beam ( see cheng & zhang 1998 ; takata et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ) . in comparison with the narrow cone - like radio beam originated from the polar cap region ,",
    "this makes the detection of @xmath0ray pulsation less sensitive to the emission and viewing geometry .",
    "as the sample sizes of radio - quiet @xmath0ray pulsars and the non - recycled radio - loud @xmath0ray pulsars are now comparable , a deeper insight of their nature can be gained by comparing their physical and emission properties .",
    "marelli et al . ( 2011,2015 ) and marelli ( 2012 ) have shown that the @xmath0ray - to - x - ray flux ratios of radio - quiet population are higher than that of radio - loud ones . while these works did not found any solid evidence for the difference between these two populations neither in terms of the physical properties ( e.g. magnetic field ) nor in @xmath0ray regime , marelli et al .",
    "( 2015 ) suggest this implies the x - ray emission of the radio - quiet population is generally fainter .",
    "the authors further speculated that this might be due to a luminous x - ray emission component from the polar caps of radio - quiet pulsars missing the line - of - sight .",
    "recently , sokolova & rubtsov ( 2016 ) have also reported their attempt in searching the difference between radio - loud and radio - quiet populations .",
    "no significant differences in their ages and locations in the galaxy have been found . on the other hand",
    ", there is a possible difference between their distributions of rotation period .",
    "the aforementioned studies have shown that the properties of radio - loud and radio - quiet @xmath0ray pulsars can be intrinsically different . however",
    ", a thorough comparison of other characteristics of pulsars , such as magnetic field strength and spectral properties , remains unreported .",
    "this motivates us to perform a systematic search for the difference of the emission and physical properties between these two populations through a detailed statistical analysis .",
    "all the data used in this work are collected from 2pc ( abdo et al .",
    "2013 ) and the third _ fermi _ @xmath0ray point sources catalog ( 3fgl ; acero et al .",
    "2015 ) , which are summarized in table  1 and table  2 .",
    "these parameters are chosen to characterize the pulsars in the following aspects :    1 .",
    "_ magnetic field strength and spin - down power _ - magnetic field strength is a crucial factor for the acceleration and emission processes in the magnetosphere ( e.g. cheng & zhang 1998 ) . in this work ,",
    "we compare the magnetic field of radio - loud and radio - quiet populations at the stellar surface @xmath5 as well as at the light cylinder @xmath6 .",
    "their strength can be derived from the spin period @xmath7 and its first time derivative @xmath8 as @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively by assuming a dipolar field geometry , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are moment of inertia , stellar radius and the speed of light .",
    "we assume @xmath14  g  @xmath15 and @xmath16  km throughout this work .",
    "+ we also compare the spin - down power @xmath17 between these two populations . as the rotational energy of a neutron star provides the reservoir for the pulsar emission , both @xmath0ray and x - ray luminosities are found to be scaled with @xmath18 ( e.g. abdo et al .",
    "2013 ; possenti et al .",
    "emission and spectral properties _ - the @xmath0ray spectra of pulsars are typically modeled by a form of a power - law with an exponential cut - off ( ple ) .",
    "the spectral shape of this model is characterized by two parameters , namely the photon index @xmath19 and the cut - off energy @xmath20 .",
    "such model is curved in comparison with a simple power - law ( pl ) .",
    "the spectral curvature of the pulsars are quantified by the parameter ` curve\\_significance ` in 3fgl , which are obtained by comparing the difference between the ple and pl mode fittings ( in unit of @xmath21 ) .",
    "+ apart from comparing these spectral parameters between the radio - loud and radio - quiet population , we also compare their @xmath0ray - to - x - ray flux ratios @xmath22 .",
    "although marelli et al . (",
    "2015 ) have already pointed out the distributions of @xmath22 are different between these two populations , an investigation of its possible correlation with other parameters such as @xmath18 remains unreported . in this study , we will not consider the @xmath0ray luminosities of pulsars as they depends on the distances which have a large uncertainties , in particular for the radio - quiet population .",
    "temporal properties _ - the viewing geometry ( i.e. the angle between the line - of - sight and the @xmath0ray emission regions ) can possibly be different between these two populations .",
    "this can possibly be reflected in their pulse profiles .",
    "different viewing geometry can lead to either be a large pulse width ( fwhm ) for the single peak cases or a large peak separation for the multiple peaks cases ( @xmath23 ) , depending on whether the line - of - sight cut through a single emission region or a multiple emission regions .",
    "this motivates us to compare the combined distributions of fwhm and @xmath23 between these two populations .",
    "+ one of the radio - quiet pulsars psr j2021 + 4026 has its @xmath0ray flux at energies @xmath2  mev suddenly decreased by @xmath24 near mjd  55850 ( allafort et al . 2013 ) .",
    "this makes it to be the first variable @xmath0ray pulsar has ever been observed . to investigate whether there is any difference between radio - quiet and radio loud populations in terms of the flux variability",
    ", we also compare their distributions of the parameter ` variability\\_index ` in 3fgl .",
    "this parameter indicates the difference between the light curve of a source and its average flux level over the full time coverage in 3fgl ( acero et al .",
    "for a ` variability\\_index ` larger than 72.44 , the null hypothesis of a source being steady can be rejected at @xmath25 confidence level ( acero et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "the histograms and the cumulative distributions of the chosen parameters are shown in figure 1 and figure 2 respectively .",
    "for searching the possible differences between the radio - loud and radio - quiet populations , we apply the non - parametric two - sample anderson - darling ( a - d ) test ( anderson & darling 1952 ; darling 1957 ; pettitt 1976 , scholz & stephens 1987 ) to their unbinned distributions ( figure 2 ) .",
    "while kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test has been widely used to test whether two unbinned distributions are different , it is not sensitive to identify the difference locates at the edges of the distributions or when these two distributions are crossed .. in view of this , we adopt a - d test in our analysis .",
    "another advantage of a - d test over k - s test is the evidence that it is better capable of detecting small differences ( engmann & cousineau 2011 ) . in this work ,",
    "we perform the two - sample a - d test with the code implemented in _",
    "scipy_. the results are summarized in table  3 .    among all the tested parameters , their distributions of ` curve\\_significance ` are found to be the most incompatible ( @xmath26value@xmath27 ) .",
    "this indicates the possible difference of their @xmath0ray spectral shape .    for comparing their flux ratios @xmath22 , we omitted all the upper - limits in tab .  1 and tab",
    "a difference is found ( @xmath26value @xmath28 ) , which is consistent with the conclusion reported by marelli et al .",
    "( 2015 ) based on comparing their binned histograms .",
    "another interesting result comes from comparing the magnetic fields of these two populations .",
    "while we do not find any difference of surface field strength @xmath29 between radio - loud and radio - quiet pulsars , the distributions of the magnetic field at the light cylinder @xmath6 are found to be different ( @xmath26value@xmath30 ; see fig . 1 & 2 )",
    ".    the statistical significances of the aforementioned differences are @xmath31 .",
    "however , these results have not taken the uncertainties of the parameters into account . for the @xmath22 reported by 2pc ,",
    "their statistical uncertainties are rather large .",
    "the average percentage error is @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the radio - loud and radio - quiet populations respectively . taking this into consideration",
    ", the difference of @xmath22 between these two populations can be drastically reduced . shifting their cumulative distributions within the tolerence of their statistical uncertainties ,",
    "the difference can possibly be reconciled ( @xmath26value@xmath34 ) .    for @xmath6",
    ", we estimate the uncertatinties by propagating the errors of @xmath7 and @xmath8 reported in 2pc or the atnf catalog ( manchester et al .",
    "the mean percentage errors of @xmath6 of radio - loud and radio - quiet populations are @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively . in view of their small uncertainties ,",
    "the statistical significance for the difference of @xmath6 between these two populations remains unaltered .    in 3fgl",
    ", there is no error estimate for ` curve\\_significance ` .",
    "however , the accuracy of this parameter depends on how well the @xmath0ray spectra can be constrained so that one can discriminate whether pl or ple models provide a better fit .",
    "this in turns depends on the photon statistics .",
    "since radio - loud @xmath0ray pulsars can be more easily detected with the aid of their radio ephemeris , their detection significances are generally lower than that of radio - quiet @xmath0ray pulsars ( see tab . 1 and 2 ) .",
    "since it is more difficult to detect the faint pulsars at energies higher than the cut - off energy , this might lead to their apparently flatter spectra . in order to test the robustness for the difference of ` curve\\_significance ` between these two populations",
    ", we alleviate this possible selection effect by re - running the a - d test on the pulsars detected at a level @xmath37 ( i.e. @xmath38 in 3fgl ) .",
    "while all the radio - quiet pulsars satisfy this criteria , this reduces the sample size of the radio - loud pulsars to 29 . in this case , the statistical significance for the difference of ` curve\\_significance ` is reduced but remains marginally at a @xmath39 level ( @xmath26value@xmath40 ) .",
    "we also considered if there is any selection effect can result in the observed difference in @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath6 is a function of @xmath7 and @xmath8 . to investigate",
    "if the difference in @xmath6 is caused by the distributions of their rotational parameters , we have also applied the a - d test",
    "seperately on @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in the full sample , we have found a marginal difference of @xmath7 between this two populations ( @xmath26value@xmath41 ) . on the other hand , we do not find any difference in the distributions of @xmath8 ( @xmath26value@xmath42 ) .",
    "however , we note that the difference in @xmath7 can possibly be a result of observational bias .",
    "for example , radio - loud pulsars can be found with their radio ephemeris .",
    "this might facilitate the detection of fast rotation . attempting to alleviate such effect , sokolova & rubtsov ( 2016 )",
    "have constructed a bias - free sample by performing blind pulsar searches from all point sources in 3fgl using only lat data . to estimate the impact of this possible selection effect in @xmath7 and @xmath43 ,",
    "we re - run the a - d test on the pulsars ( 26 radio - quiet ; 14 radio - loud ) detected in the blind search by sokolova & rubtsov ( 2016 ) .",
    "we found that the statistical significance for the difference in @xmath7 is not undermined ( @xmath26value@xmath41 ) .",
    "for @xmath43 , we found the statistical significance for the difference between two populations may drop to the level of @xmath44 ( @xmath26value@xmath45 ) .",
    "in  2.1 , we have shown the possible differences between radio - loud and radio - quiet pulsars in terms of @xmath22 , ` curve\\_significance ` and @xmath6 . in order to test if there is any relation between the emission properties ( @xmath22,`curve\\_significance ` ) and @xmath6 in each population .",
    "we proceed to perform the correlation analysis    from figure  1 , it is obvious that the distributions for most of these parameters do not resemble a gaussian . in view of this , we adopt a non - parametric approach by computing the spearman rank coefficients ( conover 1999 ; siegel & castellan 1988 ) .",
    "2pc has also reported a possible correlation between the cut - off energy @xmath20 and @xmath6 for the radio - quiet @xmath0ray pulsars ( abdo et al .",
    "however , the authors have adopted a linear correlation analysis ( i.e pearson s @xmath46 , fisher 1944 ) which implicitly assumes @xmath20 and @xmath6 follow a bivariate gaussian probability distribution .",
    "such assumption is unlikely to be satisfied ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 ) .",
    "therefore , we have also run the non - parametric correlation analysis for @xmath47 to cross - check this possible relation .",
    "the results are summarized in table  4 .",
    "for @xmath22 and ` curve\\_significance ` , we do not find any evidence for the correlation with @xmath6 in both radio - loud and radio - quiet populations . on the other hand , for the radio - quiet pulsars",
    ", @xmath20 is found to have a strong positive correlation with @xmath6 ( @xmath26value @xmath48 ) however , this relation can not be found in the radio - loud population ( @xmath26value @xmath49 ) .",
    "we further examine the phenomenological relation @xmath47 in the case of radio - quiet pulsars by assuming a linear model @xmath50 in a regression analysis .",
    "the best - fit model is :    @xmath51    which is shown in figure  4 .",
    "the quoted uncertainties are 95@xmath3 confidence intervals .",
    "we have also displayed the corresponding plot for the radio - loud pulsars for comparison .",
    "we have performed a detailed statistical analysis to probe the physical nature of radio - loud and radio - quiet @xmath0ray pulsars . by comparing the cumulative frequency distributions of a set of selected parameters ( see figure 2 ) , we have identified the possible differences between these two populations in several aspects ( cf .",
    "table 3 ) .",
    "we found that the @xmath0ray spectral curvature of radio - quiet pulsars can be larger than that of radio - loud pulsars . while the surface magnetic field strength @xmath5 has a similar distribution in both populations , their magnetic field strength at the light cylinder @xmath6",
    "are found to be different .",
    "however , we need to point out that the significance can possibly be hampered by the effect of observational selection bias .    in",
    "re - examining the distributions of nominal values of @xmath22 , we confirmed the difference between the radio - loud and radio - quiet pulsars as claimed by marelli et al .",
    "however , with the large statistical uncertainties of @xmath22 taking into account , it does not allow one to draw a firm conclusion on their difference .",
    "while the possible differences identified in our analysis might be suffered from the selection effects and the statistical uncertainties , we note that such differences can be explained in the context of outer gap model by the geometric effect and the rotational period . in the following ,",
    "we explain these properties qualitatively by assuming : ( 1 ) the @xmath0rays are originated from the outer gap , ( 2 ) the x - rays are originated from the polar cap due to backflow current heating , and ( 3 ) the open angle of the radio emission cone depends on @xmath52 ( e.g. lyne & manchester 1988 ; kijak & gil 1998 , 2003 ) .    since @xmath53 ,",
    "the differences between radio - loud and radio - quiet populations should stem from the rotational period @xmath7 ( cf .",
    "fig .  3 ) .",
    "we noted that @xmath7 of radio - loud pulsars are generally smaller than radio - quiet pulsars .",
    "we first assume all pulsars have radio emission cones .",
    "whether one is radio - loud or radio - quiet , it depends on whether the line - of - sight can meet the radio cone . from radio observations",
    ", it has been found that the radio cone size is related to the period of pulsars as @xmath54 ( e.g.,narayan & vivekanand 1983 ; lyne & manchester 1988 ; biggs 1990 ; gil , kijak , & seiradakis 1993 ; gil & han 1996 ; kijak & gil 1998 , 2003 ) , where @xmath55 is about 0.5 .",
    "therefore , shorter period pulsars will have wider radio cone and hence more favorable to be radio - loud . and",
    "hence the radio - quietness in the pulsar population might be a result of their narrower radio cones .",
    "concerning the difference in @xmath22 , we consider a geometric effect together with assumption that the x - rays are coming from the regions near the polar cap ( e.g. arons 1981 ; harding , ozernoy , & usov 1993 ; cheng , gil & zhang 1998 ; cheng & zhang 1999 ) . in this case",
    "its intensity @xmath56 should depend on the angle between the magnetic axis and the viewing angle @xmath57 , namely @xmath58 .",
    "based on the assumption that the line - of - sight of the radio - loud pulsars must be within the radio cone and that for radio - quiet pulsars is outside the radio cone , then radio loud pulsars should have smaller @xmath57 than those radio quiet pulsars .",
    "this implies the mean @xmath59 of radio - loud pulsars is larger than that of the radio - quiet pulsars . from observations and simulations ( e.g. takata , wang and cheng 2011 ) ,",
    "the difference in the @xmath60-ray flux distributions between radio - loud and radio - quiet pulsars is not very large . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath61 can vary from 0 to 1 .",
    "assuming @xmath62 is similar for these two populations , @xmath22 of radio - quiet population should be larger than the radio - loud group .",
    "we note a special pulsar psr j0537 - 6910 which is radio - quiet x - ray pulsar but without @xmath0ray emission detected ( marshall et al . 1998 ; gotthelf et al . 1998 ) .",
    "its x - ray emission is likely to be non - thermal dominant ( gotthelf et al .",
    "1998 ) which presumably originated from the synchrotron emission of backflow current in the outer gap ( cf . cheng & zhang 1999 ) .",
    "the non - detection of radio emission and the thermal x - ray component imply that our line - of - sight is far from its polar cap region . as the beaming directions of the @xmath0rays and the non - thermal x - rays are not necessary in the same direction ( cf .",
    "fig . 2 in cheng & zhang 1999 ) , our line - of - sight might miss the @xmath0ray emitting region as well .    to account for the difference of @xmath0ray spectral curvature , we speculate that inverse compton ( ic ) process may play a role in high energy photon production",
    ". the most natural soft photons are radio . for the radio - loud pulsars , which generally have wider radio cones than their radio - quiet counterparts , part of radio emission with frequency @xmath2 mhz may get into the outer gap and ic scatter with the primary electrons / positrons to the photons in gev regime ( cf .",
    "ng et al . 2014 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the probability of radio photons in radio - quiet pulsars get into the gap is low .",
    "this could lead to a shortage of photons produced at higher energies through the aforementioned ic process . and this might result in more curved spectra of radio - quiet pulsars .",
    "@xmath20 of radio - quiet pulsars are found to be strongly correlated with @xmath6 .",
    "however , such association is absent in the radio - loud population .",
    "the aforementioned ic scenario can also provide a possible way to account for this phenonmena .",
    "@xmath20 might be determined by ic scattering between the radio emission and the primary electrons / positrons in the outer gap .",
    "such effect can be enhanced if the open angle of the radio cone is larger .",
    "and hence @xmath20 should be proportional to @xmath63 and this results in the positive correlation between @xmath20 and @xmath6 . from the histograms ( cf .",
    "figure  1 ) , we notice that the spread of @xmath20 is wider in the radio - loud population than that in the radio - quiet population .",
    "this might indicate that the factor of determining the cut - off energy is more complicated in the case of radio - loud pulsars .",
    "while the differences between the radio - quiet and radio - loud pulsars reported in this work are physically plausible by the outer gap model , a firm conclusion is limited by the current sample and various observational biases . with more @xmath0ray pulsars detected in the future , their properties suggested by our analysis can be re - examined .",

    "<S> based on the full sample of non - recycled @xmath0ray pulsars , their distributions of the magnetic field strength at the light cylinder are also found to be different . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that this might be resulted from the observational bias . in re - examining the previously reported difference of @xmath0ray - to - x - ray flux ratios , we found the significance can be hampered by their statistical uncertainties . in the context of outer gap model , we discuss the expected properties of these two populations and compare with the possible differences identified in our analysis . </S>"
