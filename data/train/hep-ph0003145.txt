    "global monopoles have been investigated for years as possible seeds for structure formation in the universe @xcite .",
    "although they appear to be ruled out by the latest cosmological data @xcite , their appearance in condensed matter and other systems and their peculiar properties make them worthy of investigation .",
    "these objects have divergent energy , due to the slow fall - off of angular gradients in the fields , which has to be cut - off at a certain distance r ( in practice , the distance to the nearest monopole or antimonopole ) and has two important consequences , in particular for cosmology .",
    "first , the evolution of a network of global monopoles is very different from that of gauged monopoles , as long - range interactions enhance annihilation to the extent of eliminating the overabundance problem altogether @xcite .",
    "second , their gravitational properties include a deficit solid angle @xcite , which makes them rather exotic .",
    "the stability of global @xmath0 monopoles has been the subject of some debate in the literature @xcite . in this paper",
    "we try to settle the issue by : a ) analysing the axial perturbation equations in the limit where the cut - off is taken to infinity , and b ) proving that the energy barrier between the monopole and the vacuum ( meaning the _ extra _ energy required by the monopole to reach an unstable configuration that decays to the vacuum ) is _ finite_. it is somewhat surprising for different topological sectors to be separated by finite energy barriers , but in this case it is a consequence of the scale invariance of gradient energy on two dimensional surfaces ( @xmath1 constant ) , and therefore independent of the details of the scalar potential .",
    "we consider the simplest model that gives rise to global monopoles , the @xmath0 model with lagrangian : @xmath2 @xmath3 is a scalar triplet , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the @xmath0 symmetry is spontaneously broken to @xmath6 , leading to two goldstone bosons and one scalar excitation with mass @xmath7 .",
    "the set of ground states is the two - sphere @xmath8 and , since @xmath9 , there are field configurations with non - trivial topological charge .",
    "one such configuration with unit winding is the spherically symmetric monopole , @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "its asymptotic behaviour is @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , as can be seen from the e.o.m . of @xmath16 @xmath17",
    "the two parameters ( @xmath18 ) appearing in the lagrangian can be absorbed by the rescaling @xmath19 which amounts to choosing @xmath20 as the unit of energy and the inverse scalar mass as the unit of length ( up to a numerical factor ) .",
    "note , however , that the energy of a configuration with non - trivial winding such as ( [ mon ] ) is ( linearly ) divergent with radius , due to the slow fall - off of angular gradients and has to be cut off at @xmath21 , say . unlike @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the ( rescaled ) cut - off is an important parameter which could affect the dynamics of solutions with non - trivial topology .",
    "dropping tildes : @xmath24 since the energy diverges , derrick s theorem does not apply in this case , and in @xcite it was shown that the global monopole is stable towards radial rescalings . on the other hand",
    "the question of stability with respect to angular perturbations has led to some discussion in the literature after goldhaber @xcite pointed out that the ansatz @xmath25 which describes axially symmetric deformations of the spherical monopole ( [ mon ] ) , leads to the following expression for the energy after a change of variables @xmath26 ) : @xmath27 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\rho_1 = f_y^2+f^2 [ \\sin^2({\\bar \\theta } ) + ( { \\bar \\theta}_y)^2 ] \\nonumber\\\\ & \\rho_2 = f_r^2 + f^2 ( { \\bar \\theta}_r)^2 + { 1 \\over 2 } ( f^2 -1 ) ^2   \\label{energy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath28 , etc . the term in brackets in @xmath29 is identical to the energy of the sine - gordon soliton , so translational invariance in @xmath30 implies that configurations with @xmath31 have the same energy as ( [ mon ] ) ( which corresponds to @xmath32 ) . on a given @xmath33const .",
    "shell , the effect of taking @xmath34 is to concentrate the angular gradients in an arbitrarily small region around the north pole . when the gradient energy is inside a region of size comparable to the inverse scalar mass , it is energetically favourable to `` undo the knot '' by reducing the modulus of the scalar field to zero and climbing over the top of the mexican hat potential .",
    "unwinding is estimated to occur at a critical value of @xmath35 ( say @xmath36 ) whose dependence with @xmath37 far from the core is logarithmic , @xmath38 numerical simulation on individual shells closer to the core gives @xmath39 with slowly varying @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "unwinding is expected if @xmath42 .",
    "+    as explained in @xcite , the shift ( [ globalshift ] ) creates a tension pulling the monopole core , and the apparent unwinding ( which starts in the inner shells ) is only a manifestation of the core s translation . in order to stop the motion of the core",
    ", we consider a hybrid configuration such that the monopole core remain unperturbed and the unwinding occur in the outer shells .",
    "this is achieved by taking @xmath43 for , say , @xmath44 , a string - like configuration for @xmath45 , and some continuous interpolation in between .",
    "one such configuration ( see figure [ image]a ) would be : @xmath46 with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 given by continuity of @xmath50 .",
    "if the energy ( i.e. mass ) inside @xmath51 is large enough there will be no appreciable motion of the monopole core ( because the tension of the string is constant @xmath52 ) .",
    "for instance , simulations with @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 show different behaviour depending on @xmath56 : for @xmath57 the core translates , but for @xmath58 , the unwinding happens far from the core , which remains fixed . in the latter case",
    ", the decay of the string can also be understood as a monopole - antimonopole pair creation with the new monopole appearing at @xmath21 and the antimonopole appearing near @xmath59 .",
    "the equations solved in the simulations were @xmath60 with a dissipative term added to make the integration faster .",
    "simulations using different @xmath61 show no appreciable difference .",
    "the equations were integrated using cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath62 ) in a @xmath63 grid using explicit runge - kutta method with step size control @xcite .",
    "the output can be seen in fig .",
    "[ image]b , where the potential energy is plotted at various times , confirming that the configuration ( [ init ] ) is unstable and decays to the vacuum .",
    "we will now show that the extra energy required to reach this unstable configuration ( [ init ] ) from the spherical monopole configuration ( [ mon ] ) is",
    "_ finite_.    consider the set of configurations with @xmath64 and @xmath65 . from ( [ energy ] )",
    "the difference between the energy of any such configuration ( @xmath66 $ ] ) and the energy of the spherically symmetric unperturbed monopole ( @xmath67 $ ] ) is : @xmath68-e[0 ] & = & \\left [ \\int_{0}^{r _ * } +   \\int_{r_*}^r \\right]\\ , \\rd r\\,\\left [ { { r^2 } \\over 2 } f^2(r )   \\xi_r^2(r ) i[\\xi(r ) ] \\right]\\nonumber\\\\ i[\\xi]&=&\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } \\rd y \\ , \\sech^2(y ) \\ , \\sech^2(y+\\xi(r))\\ \\ . \\label{ixi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath69 $ ] is bell - shaped : from a maximum value @xmath70=4/3 $ ] , it rapidly falls to zero for @xmath71 as @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath73 is the radius at which @xmath74 .",
    "the first integral is clearly finite .",
    "the second can be estimated using the asymptotic form of @xmath69 $ ] and is negligible for @xmath75 even in the limit @xmath76 , where one gets @xmath77 .",
    "moreover , there is a continuous path in configuration space connecting the configurations ( [ mon ] ) and ( [ init ] ) such that @xmath66 -e[0]$ ] remains finite along the whole path : first increase @xmath35 in the outer shells @xmath78 using goldhaber s deformation ( @xmath79 ) until @xmath35 reaches @xmath80 ; then adjust the radial dependence to match ( [ init ] ) .",
    "thus , we have shown that the extra energy required by the monopole ( [ mon ] ) to go over the energy barrier and decay to the vacuum is finite even as @xmath81 ; moreover , since the monopole energy grows with r , the ratio as @xmath82 .",
    "we now turn to the classical stability of ( [ mon ] ) by considering small perturbations parametrised by @xmath83    neglecting quadratic terms gives @xmath84 ,   @xmath85 . introducing @xmath86 , @xmath87 which shows that the correct boundary conditions are that @xmath88 should vanish on the @xmath89 axis .",
    "note that @xmath90 and @xmath91 need not vanish .",
    "an infinitesimal translation of the monopole in the @xmath89 direction corresponds to @xmath92 , and both @xmath93 and @xmath94 tend to @xmath95 as @xmath96 ( see fig [ pot]a ) .",

    "@xmath115 , so there may be spureous solutions ; in particular , @xmath116 corresponds to angular perturbations that are singular on the @xmath89 axis .",
    "these are not physical , and will be discarded .",
    "but if there is no solution of ( [ eom1],[eom2 ] ) with negative @xmath98 there will be no instability in the original problem ( [ perteqs1 ] ) .",
    "our task is to find the solution to ( [ eom1],[eom2 ] ) with the minimum value of @xmath98 over all admissible perturbations and all @xmath117 .",

    "in this paper we have derived and analysed the axial perturbation equations of @xmath0 monopoles and proved that , contrary to statements in the literature , @xmath0 monopoles are perturbatively stable ( or neutrally stable ) to infinitesimal , axially symmetric , normalizable ( or power - law decay ) perturbations .",
    "we have also proved that the energy barrier between topological sectors is finite , irrespective of the details of the scalar potential .",
    "this feature is specific of global monopoles ; global vortices in two dimensions , whose energy grows logarithmically with radius , and gauge monopoles , whose energy is finite , are separated from the vacuum by an energy barrier growing linearly with the cut - off .",

    "first , we worked in flat space .",
    "second , the range of scales introduced by the expansion of the universe forces drastic approximations on cosmological simulations ; in particular , the sigma model approximation , which is widely used , sets the field on the vacuum manifold everywhere , so unwinding and pair creation events are not resolved by the grid .",
    "finally , cosmological simulations do not include thermal effects , and it has been shown that full thermal simulation across the phase transition @xcite gives qualitatively different results .",
