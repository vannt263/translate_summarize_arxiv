    "the excellent unpublished paper of zeeman @xcite about the celebrated lyness second order difference equation @xmath5 gives the key points for understanding the behaviour of the sequences generated by ( [ re2 ] ) . in this reference",

    "this conjecture has been proved to be true in @xcite .",
    "the study of the periods that can appear in the lyness equation , as well as the study of the rotation number has also been done in @xcite .",
    "this paper studies a similar problem to the one considered by zeeman but in dimension three , and proves that in this case the dynamics are also described by rotations .",
    "the fact that we are in a higher dimension makes the problem more difficult .    concretely , we consider the third order lyness recurrence , @xmath15 for @xmath16 and positive initial conditions @xmath17 and",
    "@xmath18 _ i.e. _ such that @xmath19 this recurrence is also known as todd s recurrence , see @xcite . recall that if some initial condition is such that @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the minimal positive number satisfying this property it is said that this initial condition gives rise to a @xmath22periodic sequence .",
    "it is well known that when @xmath2 for any positive initial condition it holds that all the initial conditions in @xmath23 of ( [ re1 ] ) are @xmath24 or 1-periodic .",
    "we are interested to understand which is the situation when @xmath25 our main result is :    [ reclyness ] consider the third order lyness recurrence ( [ re1 ] ) for @xmath16 and positive initial conditions @xmath17 and @xmath26 .    *",

    "we want to remark that when the recurrence ( [ re1 ] ) is considered with initial conditions in the whole @xmath40 , the periods that can appear can be different .",
    "for instance in @xcite it is proved that for some values of @xmath1 there are initial ( non positive ) conditions giving rise to periodic sequences with periods 2,3,4,5,6,7 and @xmath41 for any @xmath42    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ dds ]",
    "we state our results on the discrete dynamical system generated by @xmath43 thus obtaining the proof of theorem [ reclyness ] .",
    "all the results stated in section [ dds ] are proved in the following sections , moving some large proofs of the technical results to specific subsections and the appendices in order to improve the readability of the paper .      as usual",
    "we reduce the study of the recurrence ( [ re1 ] ) to the study of the discrete dynamical system generated by the map @xmath44 defined in @xmath34 note that this map is a diffeomorphism from @xmath23 to @xmath34 a complete description of the discrete system generated by @xmath43 gives a complete answer to the questions posed in section [ sec11 ] , and in particular a proof of theorem [ reclyness ] ( see the end of this section ) .",
    "our analysis of this dynamical system is done in two steps :    \\1 .",
    "we will see that the phase space of @xmath43 is foliated by invariant curves ( sometimes degenerated to isolated points ) which are given by the level curves of two functionally independent first integrals .",
    "the first step is to characterize the topology of this level sets , which turn to be diffeomorphic to circles ( when they are not isolated points ) .",
    "the second step is to study the dynamics of @xmath43 restricted to these invariant sets",
    ". as we will see , one of our main tools , at this stage , will be the study of an ordinary differential equation associated to the discrete dynamical system generated by @xmath43 .",
    "this is an approach different to the ones in @xcite , @xcite ( and even to the one in @xcite although our starting point is the same of this last reference ) .",
    "our approach turns out to be also effective for studying other difference equations , see @xcite .",
    "nevertheless there are some problems , named there as questions 1 and 2 , that have resisted our analysis .",
    "we remark that an answer to them would also allow to clarify the answers to the questions about  ( [ re1 ] ) stated in section [ sec11 ] .    fixed @xmath37 consider the diffeomorphism @xmath45 defined in @xmath46    we begin by introducing some sets in @xmath23 which are invariant under the action of @xmath43 , in terms of the level surfaces of the well  known ( @xcite ) couple of functionally independent first integrals of @xmath43 , given by : @xmath47 let @xmath48 and @xmath49 be the level surfaces of @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively .",

    "\\(i ) set @xmath1000 trivial but tedious computations show that the unique solution of @xmath1001 such that @xmath686 is @xmath309 which is a minimum , and that @xmath1002 hence for any @xmath170 , the equation @xmath1003 has a unique solution in @xmath1004 and a unique solution in @xmath1005 .",
    "hence @xmath1006 consists of two points , say @xmath1007 and @xmath1008 .",
    "recall that @xmath67 is the curve of @xmath172periodic points of @xmath43 , hence @xmath363 is a @xmath172periodic orbit and ( i ) holds .    to prove statement ( ii )",
    "we will see that if @xmath170 the locus of non transversal intersections of @xmath149 with @xmath76 is the empty set .",
    "consider the system @xmath570 and @xmath1009 obtained by imposing @xmath1010 .",
    "\\(iii ) recall that @xmath76 is defined by the equation @xmath1031 by applying descartes rule on @xmath76 we obtain that for all @xmath206 and @xmath1032 there exist a unique @xmath1033 solution of @xmath570 .",
    "consider the function @xmath1034 now the proof is done in two steps : ( i ) the only singular point of @xmath1035 is @xmath215 , which is a minimum .",
    "( ii ) each level curve @xmath1036 is a closed curve surrounding @xmath215 .",
    "step i : to find the singular points of @xmath1037 we look for the solutions of system @xmath1038 such that @xmath206 and @xmath1032 .",
    "the only factors in @xmath1039 and @xmath1040 giving rise to such solutions are            the common zeroes of @xmath1044 and @xmath1045 in @xmath76 are given by the zeroes of the functions @xmath624 and @xmath1046 respectively , where @xmath1047 and @xmath1048 for some polynomials @xmath21 and @xmath114 these functions are @xmath1049 the only positive solutions of @xmath1050 and @xmath1051 are given by @xmath1052 , which are the points of @xmath82 since @xmath1053 the proof of ( i ) is finished .",
    "step ii : note the following facts : from statement ( ii ) , @xmath1054 the level curves @xmath1055 are defined by @xmath1056 and thus for analytic equations and for @xmath170 they have no critical points ( since otherwise the hamiltonian vector field @xmath1057 would have another critical point than @xmath215 in contradiction with step i ) ; the sets @xmath149 are compact . from all",
    "them we conclude that for a fixed @xmath170 , each level set of @xmath1058 is diffeomorphic to a finite union of closed curves . to prove that indeed it is formed by an unique closed curve it suffices to show that the function @xmath1059 is monotonic in @xmath1060 to see this we will prove that it has the unique critical point @xmath1061 to this end note that the only positive solutions of @xmath1050 are given by the factor @xmath1062 , hence @xmath1063 .",
