    "the toric code model is a special case of a whole set of time - reversal and parity invariant lattice models that realize doubled topological quantum field theories in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions @xcite ( ` quantum double models ' ) .",
    "the implementation of such models in terms of lattice spin hamiltonians @xcite , or josephson junction arrays @xcite is under active investigation .    in this work , we are interested in the physics of a quantum double model whose microscopic degrees of freedom are non - abelian anyons . more specifically ,",
    "we investigate a quantum double model whose degrees of freedom are ising anyons . a simple example of a quantum double model appeared in @xcite where the degrees of freedom are fibonacci anyons @xcite located on the links of a honeycomb lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian penalizes fibonacci anyon fluxes through the plaquettes of the lattice , and it is exactly solvable .",

    "in fact , the system studied in @xcite is an example of a quantum double model of non - abelian anyons with both a  string - net kinetic energy ( plaquette fluxes ) and a ` string - net tension ' ( rung fluxes ) , as envisioned , but not studied , in @xcite .",
    "it was found that the competition between the rung and plaquette fluxes can be translated into the competition between two extreme topologies , each of them associated with a gapped phase . at equal magnitude of the coupling constants of",
    "rung and plaquette term , a critical point separating the gapped phases was observed .",

    "ising anyons are currently the most promising class of non - abelian anyons in the experimental context .",
    "a fractional quasiparticle charge of one quarter of the electron charge ( as expected for the ising anyon ) has been measured @xcite which raises hopes that the quasiparticles in the fractional quantum hall state with filling fraction @xmath3 are indeed ising anyons , as predicted in @xcite .",
