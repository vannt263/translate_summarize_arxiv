    "a small particle in a viscous fluid moves in such a way that the instantaneous force and torque exerted by the fluid upon the particle vanish . in this limit force and torque depend linearly on the translational and angular slip velocities of the particle , and upon the local strain rate of the flow .",

    "this degeneracy means that small perturbations are important , such as rotational brownian motion @xcite and inertia @xcite .",
    "what is known for other particle shapes ? in general the resistance tensors are found by solving the stokes problem given by the particle shape , its orientation , and the undisturbed flow in question as boundary conditions .",
    "an alternative is to use the symmetries of the problem to find conditions on the elements of the resistance tensors that allow to deduce the form of the angular equation of motion . in this way",
    "it can be shown that translational and angular dynamics decouple for particles with three mutually orthogonal mirror planes @xcite .",
    "bretherton has shown @xcite that the angular dynamics of such orthotropic particles is in general more complicated than that described by jeffery s theory . in this theory the angular motion of an ellipsoid is parametrised by two shape parameters .",
    "for an ellipsoid with half - axis lengths @xmath0 these parameters are the two aspect ratios @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",

    "we show that the angular dynamics depends on whether the mirror plane contains the axis of rotation or not .    if the mirror plane contains the axis of rotation ( as for the examples shown in fig .",
