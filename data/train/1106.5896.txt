    "in the thermodynamic analysis of mesoscopic and macroscopic systems out of equilibrium an interesting question arises : can we define a nonequilibrium temperature ?",
    "although this is possible , this temperature can not be a thermodynamic temperature since there is not a thermodynamic zero principle behind it .",
    "the consequences of this fact have been studied in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the concept of a nonequilibrium temperature can be used to parametrize the quasi - equilibrium states of a nonequilibrium system @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .    the notion of a nonequilibrium temperature",
    "can be made more precise by noting that this is a statistical concept related to the energy of a system involved in the erratic motion of its brownian degrees of freedom , that is , related to the thermal energy of the system . since the thermal energy of equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems will in general differ , one expects that the nonequilibrium temperature of an out of equilibrium system will be different from that of the heat bath . introducing the nonequilibrium temperature has the advantage that one may describe",
    "the system as is if it were at thermal equilibrium with a hypothetical bath with a temperature corresponding to this nonequilibrium temperature. this possibility has been studied for example for quantum corrections to the low temperature of thermodynamic systems or thermal radiation not in equilibrium in ref .",
    "@xcite ( page 104 , section 34 and page 189 , section 63 , respectively ) and in the case of granular matter in ref .",
    "@xcite . here , by using the nonequilibrium temperature",
    ", we will show that in the case of chemical reactions an external force shifts chemical equilibrium and increases the reaction rates .",
    "this effect may be particularly important in the case of photochemistry where the incident light increases the velocity of the reaction .    in nonequilibrium systems such as small , confined or glass - like systems haxton , introducing",
    "a nonequilibrium temperature is appropriate since this concept is a consequence of the existence of internal constraints or long - range forces and correlations which maintain the system out of thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "some of these constraints may appear at low temperatures and for small masses as in the case of quantum effects landau mentioned above .",
    "in other cases , it is a purely classical effect when the range of the interactions is similar to the size of the system .    in this article , we propose a definition of the nonequilibrium temperature @xmath0 in _ analogy _ with the equipartition theorem @xmath1where @xmath2 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath3 is a probability distribution describing the state of the system which , for convenience s sake , we assume to depend on a pair of conjugated slow @xmath4 and fast @xmath5 variables ( a velocity ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath6 is a reduced probability distribution .",
    "one of the goals of this article consists of showing how this nonequilibrium temperature , which we will call effective temperature , is connected to the bath temperature and the forces which maintain the system out of equilibrium @xcite .",
    "we also analyze how the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) is modified in systems far from equilibrium and how the effective temperature comes into play in order to extend the validity of this fdt to quasistationary nonequilibrium systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we analyze brownian motion in a field of force .",
    "we obtain the fokker - planck equation and a general expression for the effective temperature and its average value the mean - field temperature. we also obtain the generalized smoluchowski equation describing the quasi - equilibrium state .",
    "section 3 is devoted to studying the effects of the mean - field temperature on chemical reaction rates . in section 4",
    "we analyze the fdt",

    "a gradient of the chemical potential in phase space ( [ chemicalpotential ] ) induces a diffusion process which tends to restore the equilibrium state . through this process , the distribution function changes according to the generalized liouville equation@xmath25which defines the diffusion current @xmath26 and where @xmath27 is the velocity corresponding to the hamiltonian flow and @xmath28 , with @xmath29 .    from eq .",

    "it is clear that the external force shifts the chemical equilibrium and increases the reaction rates .",
