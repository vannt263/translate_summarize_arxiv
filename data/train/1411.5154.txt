    "observational data on type ia supernovae have shown that the current universe is accelerating and the acceleration began in the recent past of the universe @xcite .",
    "this was further supported by the observations on cosmic microwave background radiations ( cmbr ) @xcite and large scale structure @xcite . despite the mounting observational evidence on this recent acceleration ,",
    "its nature and fundamental origin is still an open question .",
    "many models has been proposed to explain this current acceleration .",
    "basically there are two approaches .",
    "the first one is to modify the right hand side of the einstein s equation by considering specific forms for the energy - momentum tensor @xmath8 having a negative pressure , which culminate in the proposal of an exotic energy called dark energy .",
    "the simplest candidate for dark energy is the so - called cosmological constant @xmath9which is characterized by the equation of state , @xmath10 and a constant energy density @xcite .",
    "however , it faced with many drawbacks . of these ,",
    "the two main problems are the coincidence problem and the fine tuning problem @xcite .",
    "coincidence problem refers to the coincidence of densities of dark matter and dark energy , even though their evolutions are different , and the fine tuning problem refers to the discrepancy between the theoretical and the observational value of the vacuum constant or cosmological constant , which is assumed to drive the accelerated expansion .",
    "these discrepancies motivated the consideration of various dynamical dark energy models like quintessence @xcite , k - essence @xcite and perfect fluid models ( like chaplygin gas model ) @xcite . the second approach for explaining the current acceleration of the universe is to modify the left hand side of the einstein s equation , i.e. , the geometry of the space time .",
    "the models that belong to this class ( modified gravity ) are the so called @xmath11 gravity @xcite , @xmath12gravity @xcite , gauss - bonnet theory @xcite , lovelock gravity @xcite , horava - lifshitz gravity @xcite , scalar - tensor theories @xcite , braneworld models @xcite etc .",
    "it was noted by several authors that the bulk viscous fluid can produce acceleration in the expansion of the universe .",
    "this was first studied in the context of inflationary phase in the early universe @xcite . in the context of late acceleration of the universe ,",
    "the effect of bulk viscous fluid was studied in references @xcite . but",
    "a shortcoming in considering the bulk viscous fluid is the problem of finding out a viable mechanism for the origin of bulk viscosity in the expanding universe . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", bulk viscosity can arise due to deviations from the local thermodynamic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "in cosmology , bulk viscosity arises as an effective pressure to restore the system back to its thermal equilibrium , which was broken when the cosmological fluid expands ( or contract ) too fast .",
    "this bulk viscosity pressure generated , ceases as soon as the fluid reaches the thermal equilibrium @xcite .    in this paper , we analyze matter dominated cosmological model with bulk viscosity with reference to the question whether it can cause the recent acceleration of the universe .",
    "we took the bulk viscosity coefficient as proportional to both the velocity and acceleration of the expansion of the universe .",
    "the matter is basically a pressureless fluid comprising both baryonic and dark matter components .",
    "if the bulk viscous matter produce the recent acceleration of the universe then it would unify the description of both dark matter and dark energy .",
    "the advantage is that it automatically solves the coincidence problem because there is no separate dark energy component .",
    "a similar model was studied by avelino et al .",
    "@xcite , but in constraining the parameters , ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) using the observational data the authors fixed either @xmath2 or @xmath3 as zero .",
    "so it is effectively a two parameter model . in this reference",
    "the authors have ruled out the possibility of bulk viscous matter to be a candidate for dark energy .",
    "we think that one should study the model by evaluating all the parameters simultaneously , which may lead to a more mature conclusion regarding the status of bulk viscous dark matter as dark energy . in the present work we aim to such an analysis in studying the evolution of all the cosmological parameters by simultaneously evaluating all the constant parameters on which the total bulk viscous coefficient depends .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we present the basic formalism of the bulk viscous matter dominated flat universe .",
    "we derive the hubble parameter in this section . in section [ sec:3 ] , we identify two different limiting conditions for the bulk viscous coefficients corresponding to which the universe begins with a big - bang , followed by an early decelerated epoch and then entering a phase of recent acceleration . we also present the evolution of the scale factor and age of the universe in this section .",
    "in section [ sec:4a ] we study the evolution of the cosmological parameters like deceleration parameter , the equation of state parameter , matter density and curvature scalar .",
    "section [ sec:8 ] consists of the study of the status of local second law and generalized second law of thermodynamics in the model . in section [ sec:9 ] we presents the statefinder analysis of the model to contrast it with other standard models of dark energy . the estimation of parameters using type ia supernova data is given in section [ sec : estmation ] , followed by conclusions in section [ sec : conclu ] .",
    "we consider a spatially flat universe described by the friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric , @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the co - moving coordinates , @xmath15 is the cosmic time and @xmath16 is the scale factor of the universe dominated with bulk viscous matter , which can produce an effective pressure @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the normal pressure , which is zero for non - relativistic matter and @xmath19 is the coefficient of bulk viscosity , which can be a function of hubble parameter and its derivatives in an expanding universe . we have not considered the radiation component , as it is a reasonable simplification as long as we are concerned with late time acceleration .",
    "the form of equation ( [ p ] ) was originally proposed by eckart in 1940 @xcite .",
    "a similar theory was also proposed by landau and lifshitz @xcite .",
    "however , eckart theory suffer from pathologies .",
    "one of them is that in this theory , dissipative perturbations propagate at infinite speeds @xcite .",
    "another one is that the equilibrium states in the theory are unstable @xcite . in 1979 ,",
    "israel and stewart @xcite developed a more general theory which was causal and stable and one can obtain the eckart theory from it in the first order limit , when the relaxation time goes to zero .",
    "so , in the limit of vanishing relaxation time , the eckart theory is a good approximation to the israel - stewart theory .    even though eckart theory have drawbacks , it is less complicated than the israel - stewart theory .",
    "so it has been used widely by many authors to characterize the bulk viscous fluid .",
    "for example in references @xcite , eckart approach has been used in dealing with the accelerating universe with the bulk viscous fluid . in this context , it is reasonable to point out that hiscock et .",
    "al.@xcite have found that pathological eckart theory and also truncated israel- stewart theory ( avoiding the non - linear terms ) can produce early inflation .",
    "however , as pointed out by the same authors , in the truncated version of israel - stewart theory , the relaxation time stands to be a constant which is in fact not logically correct in an expanding universe . however , there exist some later studies @xcite which deals with the importance of equation of state in such theories inorder to explain the acceleration .",
    "but , it should be checked whether these theories will produce the late acceleration of the universe as observed today .",
    "one should also note at this juncture that a more general formulation than israel - stewart model was proposed by pavon et al .",
    "@xcite for irreversible process , especially in dealing with thermodynamic equilibrium of dissipative fluid .",
    "the friedmann equations describing the evolution of flat universe dominated with bulk viscous matter are , @xmath20 @xmath21 where we have taken @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the matter density and overdot represents the derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath15 .",
    "the conservation equation is @xmath24    in this paper we consider a parameterized bulk viscosity of the form @xcite , @xmath25 in an expanding universe , the bulk viscosity coefficient may depends on both the velocity and acceleration .",
    "the most logical form can be a linear combination of three terms : the first term is a constant @xmath1 , the second term is proportional to the hubble parameter , which characterizes the dependence of the bulk viscosity on velocity , and the third is proportional to @xmath26 , characterizing the effect of acceleration on the bulk viscosity .",
    "moreover , such a form for the bulk viscous coefficient implies the most general form of the equation of state @xcite . in terms of hubble parameter @xmath27 ,",
    "this can be written as , @xmath28 from friedmann equations , and from equations ( [ p ] ) , ( [ conser ] ) and ( [ z ] ) , we can obtain a first order differential equation for hubble parameter by replacing @xmath29 with @xmath30 through @xmath31 as ,    @xmath32    where @xmath33 are the dimensionless bulk viscous parameters and @xmath34 is the present value of the hubble parameter .",

    "<S> we consider a cosmological model dominated by bulk viscous matter with total bulk viscosity coefficient proportional to the velocity and acceleration of the expansion of the universe in such a way that @xmath0 we show that there exist two limiting conditions in the bulk viscous coefficients , ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) which corresponds to a universe having a big - bang at the origin , followed by an early decelerated epoch and then making a smooth transition into an accelerating epoch . </S>",
    "<S> we have constrained the model using the type ia supernovae data , evaluated the best estimated values of all the bulk viscous parameters and the hubble parameter corresponding to the two limiting conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we found that even though the evolution of the cosmological parameters are in general different for the two limiting cases , they show identical behavior for the best estimated values of the parameters from both the limiting conditions . a recent acceleration would occur if @xmath4 for the first limiting conditions and if @xmath5 for the second limiting conditions . the age of the universe predicted by this model is found to be less than that predicted from the oldest galactic globular clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the total bulk viscosity seems to be negative in the past and becomes positive when @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> so the model violates the local second law of thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> however , the model satisfies the generalized second law of thermodynamics at the apparent horizon throughout the evolution of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> we also made a statefinder analysis of the model and found that it is distinguishably different from the standard @xmath7cdm model at present , but shows a de sitter type behavior in the far future of the evolution .    </S>",
