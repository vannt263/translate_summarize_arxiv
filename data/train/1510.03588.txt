    "<S> fragmentation and growth - fragmentation equations is a family of problems with varied and wide applications . </S>",
    "<S> this paper is devoted to the description of the long - time asymptotics of two critical cases of these equations , when the division rate is constant and the growth rate is linear or zero . </S>",
    "<S> the study of these cases may be reduced to the study of the following fragmentation equation : @xmath0 using the mellin transform of the equation , we determine the long - time behavior of the solutions . </S>",
    "<S> our results show in particular the strong dependence of this asymptotic behavior with respect to the initial data .    </S>",
