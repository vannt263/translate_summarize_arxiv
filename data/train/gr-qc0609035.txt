    "hogarth has shown that not only any universal statement , such as goldbach s conjecture , but any arithmetical statement can be resolved in finite time , in a suitable malament - hogarth ( mh ) space - time ( these are defined in 1.1 below ) .",
    "our main observations are twofold : firstly that there is no reason for hogarth to stop at first order statements of arithmetic : effectively borel statements ( so hyperarithmetic in second order number theory , or the structure of analysis ) can likewise be resolved ( section 2 ) :    * theorem a. * _ if @xmath1 is any hyperarithmetic predicate on integers , then there is an mh in which any query @xmath2 can be computed .",
    "_    in fact for any transfinite borel statement about the integers one can define a mh spacetime in which the statement can be resolved .    in one sense",
    "this is best possible , as secondly , there is an upper bound to computational ability in any spacetime , which is thus a universal constant@xmath3of the space - time @xmath4 ( section 3 ) .",
    "the following is merely an observation :    * theorem c. * _ assuming the ( modest and standard ) requirement that space - time manifolds be paracompact and hausdorff , for any mh spacetime @xmath4 there will be a countable ordinal upper bound , @xmath6 , on the complexity of predicates in the borel hierarchy resolvable in it .",
    "_    etesi and nmeti noted in @xcite that some @xmath0 relations on natural numbers which are neither universal @xmath7 nor co - universal @xmath8 , can be decided in certain mh spacetimes ( instantiated by rotating kerr black holes ) and they ask specifically as to the extent of computational limits in such spacetimes .",
    "* theorem b. * _ the relations @xmath9 computable in the spacetimes of @xcite form a subclass of the @xmath10-relations on @xmath11 ; this is a proper subclass if and only if there is a fixed finite bound on the number of signals sent to the observer on the finite length path . _    this is treated in sect 2.2 .",
    "pitowsky @xcite gives an account of an attempt to define spacetimes in which supertasks can almost be completed - essentially they allow the result of infinitely many computations by one observer @xmath12 ( he used the , as then unsolved , example of fermat s last theorem ) performed on their infinite ( _ i.e. _ endless in proper time ) world line @xmath13 , to check whether there exists a triple of integers @xmath14 for some @xmath15 as a counterexample to the theorem or not . if a counterexample was found a signal would be sent to another observer @xmath16 travelling along a world line @xmath17 .",
    "the difference being that the proper time along @xmath17 was finite , and thus @xmath16 could know the truth or falsity of the theorem in a ( for them ) finite time , depending on whether a signal was received or not .",

    "hogarth s perhaps more succinct picture is on the right .",
    "+     + to rerun ( and update ) the pitowski argument : the proper time along @xmath13 is infinite , thus a turing machine can be programmed to look for counterexamples to the goldbach conjecture ( or any other proposition involving a single universal quantifier over an unquantified matrix : @xmath29 ) by checking @xmath30 each of which in turn only takes a finite amount of time ; if a counterexample is found a signal is sent out to the observer @xmath31 travelling along the finite proper time curve @xmath17 .",
    "if no signal is received by the time @xmath31 reaches @xmath24 then @xmath31 knows that the conjecture is true .",
    "either way @xmath31 is supposed to have discovered the truth by this point .    to obtain a spacetime as above , they take minkowski spacetime @xmath32 and choose a scalar field @xmath33 which is everywhere equal to 1 outside of a compact set @xmath34 , and which rapidly goes to @xmath35 as the point @xmath36 is approached .",

    "earman and norton discuss at length the physical possibilities and difficulties of this scenario : gdel spacetimes are mh , but are causally vicious ; the toy spacetime above need not satisfy any energy conditions ; anti - de sitter spacetime is mh , but fails a strong energy condition ; reissner - nordstrom spacetime meets this , but as in all mh spacetimes there is divergent blue - shift of the signal to @xmath31 ; further , of the unbounded amplification of signals that @xmath31 may have to receive , etc .",
    "it is not our aim here to add to this discussion on _ physical _ viabi__lities but to make some observations on the purely _ logico - mathematical _ possibilities and boundaries of this kind of arrangement .",
    "logicians accordingly calibrate the complexity of propositions in the language of arithmetic by the following hierarchy :    ( arithmetical hierarchy ) call a predicate @xmath39 @xmath40 or @xmath41 if @xmath42 is recursive ;    @xmath43 is in @xmath44 iff @xmath45 is in @xmath46 ;    if @xmath47 then @xmath48 is in @xmath49 .    a recursive predicate may be taken as one given by the extension of a quantifier free formula of the language of arithmetic .",

    "a segment of spacetime such as the above can be used to decide membership of any @xmath54 or @xmath55 definable set of integers ( just as the set of even integers which satisfy goldbach s conjecture is a @xmath56 set , so the statement of goldbach s conjecture forms a @xmath54 sentence , whose extension is a truth value , _",

    "a signal is sent to @xmath68 to start to decide @xmath69 etc . ultimately , putting this all together , again @xmath31 receives a signal if @xmath70 , or else knows after a finite interval that it is true .",

    "again the various regions are connected in such an inductive manner that no points receive infinitely many signals , and on @xcite pp 131 following _ prima facie _ reasons of how the `` hardware '' fits in to the regions concerned are given .",
    "an initial turing machine is thought of as `` control '' of the process , in that , for example , it signals to activate the appropriate @xmath77 region to compute the answer when given as input a query whose complexity is @xmath88 . to actually define the ad spacetime",

    "the question of how far one can proceed in the arithmetical hierarchy is also raised and discussed by etesi & nmeti in @xcite .",
    "our thesis is that one can decide questions far beyond arithmetic in suitable spacetimes ( theorem a ) .",

    "first a definition : let @xmath92 be the tree of all finite sequences of natural numbers ordered by reverse inclusion ( thus the empty sequence @xmath93 is the topmost element of this tree and we view it as growing downwards as sequences are extended )",
    ". members of @xmath94 are thus finite functions : @xmath95 with each @xmath96 .",
    "a _ finite path tree _ is any subtree @xmath97 of @xmath98where all branches under @xmath99 are of finite length .",
    "we assign _ ordinal ranks _ to the nodes of a finite path tree ( which we shall call just trees from now on ) by induction : the terminal `` leaves '' at the end of the branches are given rank zero , and in general the rank of a node @xmath100 is the least strict upper bound of the ranks of the nodes @xmath101which extend the sequence @xmath102 .",
    "the _ rank of t _ is then the rank of the empty sequence , @xmath93 , the topmost node .",
    "the point is that the tree , although all branches are of finite length , is in general infinitely splitting ( a given node @xmath102 may have infinitely many immediate one step extensions ) ; hence ranks of nodes can in general be infinite , but of countable ordinal height ( for an account of this and the following context , see _ e.g. _ @xcite sect.15.2 ) .",
    "we are less interested in the tree as being composed of finite sequences of natural numbers , but rather the graph of the tree , or what it looks like : the finite sequences simply give an informative way of indexing the nodes of the tree .",
    "we shall be affixing other _ labels _ to the nodes of such trees . since an ad spacetime consists of an infinite string of regions @xmath65 where each is an @xmath79 spacetime region , which itself ( if @xmath103 is a string of @xmath77 spacetime regions , we can picture an ad spacetime by the finite path tree :    finite path trees can be used to describe the construction of sets in the _ borel hierarchy _ of sets of reals numbers . by `` the reals '' here we mean infinite strings of integers from @xmath11 , thus elements of _ baire space _",

    "nothing that we do , or analytical problems that we attempt to solve in such spacetimes , depends on any _ geometric _ consideration , or on the usual euclidean metric on the real continuum .  ]",
    "a basic open neighbourhood in this topology is a set of the form @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a finite initial segment of @xmath107 ( thus if @xmath108 is of length @xmath50 , @xmath109 for @xmath110 we define in marginally greater generality the borel hierarchy in the space @xmath111 where @xmath11 has the discrete topology and again the product topology is taken on this with the @xmath104 .",

    "we may then grow a finite path tree with @xmath120 at the topmost node , then , infinitely splitting the tree below this node we have at the next level down , the sets @xmath131 which occur at lower levels in the hierarchy .",

    "in this way we can consider borel sets as built up according to a recipe , that can be described by a finite path tree ( _ finite _ because the ordinals are wellfounded ) where the determining labels are the ( at most countably many ) basic open sets attached to each of the end nodes of each branch ( and the appropriately constructed sets labelling the nodes higher up , although of course the whole tree labelling is determined by the tree structure and the assignment of basic open sets at the terminal nodes ) .",
    "as the reader can work out for his or herself , @xmath49 predicates @xmath42 of integers can be obtained by a process that can be given by a diagram that has the structure of a tree of rank @xmath141 ( the @xmath56 sets are at the bottom at rank 0 , @xmath55 occupy the next layer up , @xmath54 then occur at the rank 2 next level after that ; then come @xmath84 sets having rank 3 , and so on ; the @xmath49 set @xmath42 occupies the node labelled by the empty sequence ) .",
    "the arithmetic sets are those that can be built up using basic open sets in a finite number of stages : they are those sets of finite rank : symbolically arithmetic = @xmath142 .",
    "hogarth s ad spacetime is thus needed to calculate answers to membership questions of the form @xmath143 ? where @xmath144 ranges over arithmetic sets .",
    "the reader can probably now surmise what is going to happen : one can form sets of integers @xmath145 which are _ not _ arithmetic : they are countable unions of such but there is no finite bound on their definitional complexity .",
    "such is represented by a tree with no finite bound on path length , but has infinite rank .",
    "actually one construal of an ad spacetime is that it could answer questions of the form @xmath146 for _ some _ @xmath147 : such an @xmath148 where each @xmath149 is arithmetic .",

    "region can calculate truth values of both @xmath155 and @xmath88 statements , whereas drawing a tree for a @xmath88 set adds one rank over an @xmath155 set , but this is inessential difference which may be ignored .",
    "] why just _ some _ @xmath156 sets @xmath144 in the above ? because the sequence of sets @xmath157 may not be recursively , or _ effectively _ given to us",
    ". the description of this sequence may itself be beyond the computational powers of us or our spacetime - regions .",
    "accordingly we first focus on a hierarchy of sets that can be given an effective or algorithmic description .",
    "this special class of sets of integers are wellknown and are called the _ hyperarithmetic _ sets ( _ cf_@xcite 16.8 or @xcite ) : these are formed by protocols that _ can _ be represented by finite path trees of _ recursive ordinal _ height , where the terminal nodes are labelled with a recursively given list of basic open sets . which will compute a set of integers @xmath158 that codes in some sensible fashion , a wellordering , @xmath159 , of a set of integers of length or _ order type _ that ordinal .",
    "there is a least ordinal countable ordinal which is not so representable , and is known as @xmath160 ( read `` church - kleene - omega-1 '' ) . ]",

    "in short , the hyperarithmetic sets are those where there is a _ recursive description of their construction via finite path trees_.     we may imagine then , in analogy to an ad spacetime , for a given hyperarithmetic set @xmath144 , a spacetime @xmath163 which consists of a suitable piece of the manifold where there is a tree structure of computational components reflecting the construction of @xmath144 from recursive ( in topological terms , basic open ) sets . an initial `` control '' machine is given @xmath87 ( the integer on which the query is based ) , together with @xmath164 the code of the machine which outputs the recursive tree structure @xmath165 of the set @xmath144 being queried .",
    "the spacetime has been chosen so that its open regions @xmath166 correspond to this recursive tree structure and so to the subqueries that arise , and these will be arranged as nested subregions in a way reflecting precisely the structure of @xmath165 ( just as an @xmath77 region is physically arranged or chosen so that it can answer @xmath155 or @xmath88 queries ) .",
    "the adaptation of the toy spacetime construction for the case of an ad spacetime , is the same as for any @xmath163 spacetime : it simply a matter of ensuring the line segment @xmath89 intersects each of the regions of the components appropriately",
    ".    we can be more specific in this regard : hogarth needs a plentiful supply of points where the metric goes rapidly to @xmath35 . in defining a @xmath71 region an @xmath167-sequence of points @xmath168",
    "is needed which will eventually be removed from the manifold , but towards each of which the metric goes to @xmath35 and there is some @xmath169 with @xmath170 containing an endless half - line approaching @xmath171 ; for a @xmath80 region each of the @xmath167-sequence of @xmath53 regions is replaced by a @xmath71 region ( which in turn contains an @xmath167-sequence of removed points ) ; thus a sequence of points of order type @xmath172 where the metric goes to @xmath35 is needed",

    "hence from @xmath164 we may envisage a control program indexed by some @xmath258 which takes a query @xmath259and if @xmath243 it computes the recursive list @xmath260 of indices of codes , passing @xmath87 and these indices to each in turn of an infinite list of machines at the next level down ; these machines compute @xmath261 in turn , and act according to the @xmath262 outcome . eventually , as the terminal leaves in the tree are reached , the last code is that of a basic open set , and any such is recursive .",
    "we conclude :    if @xmath263 enumerates those indices of turing programs that `` construct '' in the above sense hyperarithmetic sets @xmath264 , _ via _ recursive trees , we may define a single mh ` hyperarithmetically deciding' , hypd , spacetime region in which any query of the form @xmath265 can be answered in finite time .    in the above",
    ", we may define the hypd region by piecing together parts of spacetime that are `` @xmath266-deciding '' just as an ad region can be so defined : an overall control machine can take @xmath267 as input and activate the @xmath181th machine constructing @xmath264 .",
    "it is worth emphasising that no machine in this tree array is itself performing `` supertasks '' ( _ i.e. _ performing infinitely many actions in its own proper time ) , but if it issues a signal to another process , it does so only once after a finite amount of its own proper time .",
    "however a tree structure for such a region can no longer have recursive ordinal height , as it can be shown ( again see @xcite ) that the ranks of finite path trees constructing hyperarithmetic sets exhaust all the recursive ordinals .",
    "thus a mh spacetime may be able to calculate `` beyond '' any hyperarithmetic set , but the spacetime structure is not realised by a recursive tree .",
    "moreover as noted above , _ any _ finite path tree can be realised in a mh spacetime : thus there apparently is no _ a priori _ upper bound on computational complexity .",
    "etesi and nmeti consider a special class of mh spacetimes , kerr spacetimes , which contain rotating blackholes .",
    "( the reasons , which we shall not discuss , of why they choose this particular spacetime , is that the physics of communication between the observer moving along an infinite @xmath13 to that on @xmath17 is less problematic . )",
    "their proposition 1 shows , just as @xcite did , that any @xmath55 predicate can be decided in their arrangement .",
    "they also obey assumption 2 that there is no swamping , and in fact , initially at least , the observer @xmath75 travelling along @xmath13 only sends a single signal to @xmath24 on @xmath17 .",
    "they further remark though ( prop .",
    "2 ) that in fact the set - up allows for resolving of queries @xmath268 for sets slightly more complicated : @xmath269 can be taken as a union of a @xmath55 and a @xmath54 set - and thus need not be in either class . indeed they indicate an argument at prop.3 , that if the observer @xmath75 is allowed to send @xmath50 different signals , ( they take @xmath270 then any @xmath50-fold boolean combination of @xmath55 and @xmath54 sets @xmath271  ( with @xmath272 and @xmath273 ) can be decided .",
    "they ask how far in the arithmetical hierarchy this can kind of argument can be taken .",
    "the classes of predicates just indicated all fall within @xmath10 ( @xmath274 .",
    "however , even allowing @xmath50 to go to @xmath275 will not exhaust this class .",
    "the class of @xmath10 predicates can be characterised using turing machines that may write to an output tape a single 0 or 1 digit , which the machine may however later change ( this class was studied , and so characterised , by a number of persons , davis , gold @xcite , putnam @xcite ) .",
    "( putnam @xcite ) @xmath276 is _ a trial and error predicate _ if there are turing machines @xmath277 of this sort so that    \\(i ) each of @xmath278 changes its mind about its output at most finitely many times , for any input @xmath87 , and    \\(ii )  @xmath279the eventual value of @xmath280 s output tape on input @xmath87 is 1    @xmath281the eventual value of @xmath282 s output tape on input @xmath87 is 0 .",
    "we then have that @xmath276 is @xmath10 if and only if it is a trial and error predicate",
    ". can etesi and nmeti s analysis of boolean combinations of universal and co - universal predicated be extended to trial and error predicates ?",
    "the answer has to be no , if the machinery is required to only send a fixed number of signals to @xmath24 on @xmath17 : the observer @xmath36 on @xmath13 may now run two turing machines @xmath277 of the above type , and may send a signal @xmath283 to @xmath24  each time @xmath284 changes its output digit , but crucially we do not know in advance how many times that will be .",
    "it is not that @xmath24 _ will _ or _ may _ receive infinitely many signals ( so it is not `` swamping '' that is the problem ) , but that @xmath24 will have to be prepared to receive a _",
    "potential _ infinity of signals of one type , if the arrangement is to resolve @xmath10 predicates .",
    "it is not hard to show that there are @xmath10 predicates @xmath269 so that for any representation in terms of machines of the type @xmath284 above , there will be no recursive functions @xmath285 so that @xmath286 bounds the number of times that @xmath284 changes its mind about input @xmath87 .",
    "( hence for deciding @xmath10-predicates , it is not just that we can not do this if there is a fixed @xmath50 on the number of alternations which works for any @xmath87 as input ; we can not , given the input @xmath87 run some other initial recursive test on @xmath87 to determine _ in advance _",
    "what the @xmath287 should be for this particular @xmath87 .",
    "however if we relax this fixed bounding assumption on the number of signals that can be transmitted to @xmath24 ( but still require the number to be finite so that assumption 2 holds ) then both these spacetimes ( and also @xmath53 spacetimes ) can compute @xmath10 ( but not in general @xmath84 ) predicates .",
    "we summarise this discussion as :    * theorem b. * _ the relations @xmath9 computable in such spacetimes form a subclass of the @xmath10-relations on @xmath11 ; this is a proper subclass if and only if there is a fixed finite bound on the number of signals sent to the observer on the finite length path . _",
    "there are only countably many hyperarithmetic sets ( as there are only countably many recursive trees ) whilst there are uncountably many non - recursive finite path trees .",
    "however hogarth s construction of ad spacetime regions , which we have extended to hyperarithmetic deciding regions , only depends on being able to take the `` toy '' spacetime construction at the beginning and reproduce that in a suffiently nested manner in order to create more and more complicated regions .",
    "it is possible that a piece of an mh spacetime has a region that reflects the structure of a finite path tree that is _ not _ recursive : given _ any _ finite path tree @xmath161 one can `` construct '' an mh spacetime @xmath288 satisfying the requirement that its @xmath90 components reflect the structure of @xmath161 .",
    "the reader may very well have several objections at this point ( if not well before ) : ( i ) that in general we may have no way of conceiving of a  `` problem '' or `` calculation ''  at an arbitrary level of complexity in this hierarchy ; that ( ii ) if we could we would not be able to initiate , or `` control '' the hardware for the problem ( or even locate the relevant spacetime region in which it could be performed ! ) .",
    "just to consider the objection ( ii ) first : i think this problem already arises for an ad spacetime : this contains an infinite string of turing machines , that whilst acting independently to some extent in their own patches of spacetime @xmath65 , and not swamping each other with messages , can not conceivably be `` set up '' or initialised by finite beings in a finite time , to perform the task in our mind .",
    "hogarth imagines the machinery all set up and ready to go : it is just waiting for our input and the switch to be thrown .",
    "however we can imagine that here too . for ( i )",
    ": we can readily conceive of , or think up , mathematical questions about @xmath156 or @xmath289 or @xmath290 for larger recursive ordinals the questions are more likely to be intimately related to those ordinals , rather than some general problem in number theory .",
    "indeed it is not clear anyway what the class of hyperarithmetic sets is : for example , we are unable to enumerate them in any effective way : we may define them as those sets built up using those turing machines @xmath291 which output codes of finite path trees , but in fact we have no effective or algorithmic way of knowing of a given index @xmath164 whether @xmath292 does or does not code a finite path tree . in general whether @xmath255 codes a ( not necessarily finite ) path tree is iself a @xmath54 property of @xmath164 but that it codes a _ finite _ , that is , a _ wellfounded _ path tree is far even from arithmetic - set of integers : it thus requires a universal function quantification in analysis , or second order number theory ( see for example , @xcite thm._xx_. ) ] . supposing we did actually have a part of our spacetime which was hypd ( and we could recognise it ! ) then given an integer @xmath87 we would not know in full and absolute generality , which indices @xmath164 it is suitable to even ask @xmath259  however this is not really the point of the argument : we are looking at logico - mathematical boundaries to these kinds of spacetimes ( and not anthropomorphic limitations ) .",
    "any set of integers @xmath233 whatsoever can be seen as resolvable by a @xmath293 spacetime region containing a finite path tree structure @xmath161 with an assignment of basic open sets , _",
    "i.e. _ recursive sets , to the terminal nodes : it is that we can cheat and hardwire the answers to queries concerning @xmath235 _ into _ the very structure of the tree @xmath161 beforehand ( just as any set @xmath235 indeed has a code according to the definition above , but again for trivial reasons ) .",
    "note that @xmath297 ( @xmath298 implies that @xmath4 contains no sad regions whatsoever , that is , is not mh ; the upper bound is for the trivial reason that every finite path tree is a countable object and so can not have uncountable ordinal rank ) .",
    "proof : we here use our assumptions on our manifolds : assumption ( i ) that for different @xmath296 the different @xmath301 component occupy disjoint open regions @xmath302 of the manifold , and ( ii ) that the manifold is separable ( which follows from paracompactness and being hausdorff ) .",
    "let @xmath303 be a countable dense subset of @xmath304 .",
    "then each open region @xmath302 of @xmath304 contains members of @xmath120 .",
    "as disjoint regions contain differing members of @xmath120 there can only be countably many such regions @xmath305 and therefore a countable bound .",
    "qed      consequently , if _ our _ spacetime @xmath308 happens to be mh , then for some countable universal constant of our universe , @xmath309 , the possible `` calculations '' theoretically performable all have complexity bounded by @xmath310 .",
