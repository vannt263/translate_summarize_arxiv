    "the simple relation   suggests that there exists mainly two contributions to the temperature dependence of the heat current for a two - segment system .",
    "the first contribution comes from the temperature difference @xmath75 , which acts as an external thermal force and yields the regularly increasing behavior of @xmath1 with decreasing @xmath9 .",

    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ j_tr_lambda ] that unlike @xmath75 , @xmath87 is an increasing function of @xmath9 .",
    "the widening of the overlap band of the vibrational spectrum of segments @xmath88 and @xmath89 , or @xmath90 , is mainly responsible for this increasing behavior of the thermal conductance .",
    "consequently , the origin of ndtr effect is basically the competition between the growing  external field \" @xmath75 and the diminishing overlap band @xmath91 as @xmath9 decreases .",
    "ndtr thus occurs below the temperature @xmath61 at which the opposite behavior of both contributions exactly compensate each other and it takes place if and only if @xmath87 becomes dominant for @xmath92 . fig .",
    "[ j_tr_lambda ] shows the apparition of ndtr effect as one considers different nonlinearity parameters @xmath93 for the @xmath51 model .",
