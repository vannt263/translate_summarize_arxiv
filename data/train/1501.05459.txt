    "galaxy formation is a complicated combination of many different physical processes , such as gravitational collapse ( eggen et al . 1962 ) , accretion of subgalactic clumps ( e.g. , searle & zinn 1978 ) , hierarchical merging of dark matter halos ( e.g. , white & rees 1978 ) , star formation and its feedback effects ( e.g. , larson 1974 ; dekel & silk 1986 ) , growth of bars and spiral arms ( e.g. , sellwood & carlberg 1984 ; athanassoula 2003 ) , clump dynamics ( e.g. , noguchi 1999 ) , feedback effects of active galactic nuclei ( e.g. , di matteo et al . 2005 ; springel et al . 2005 ) , hot and cold mode gaseous accretion ( e.g. , keres et al . 2005 ; dekel & birmboim 2006 ) , and environmental influences of groups and clusters ( e.g. , dressler 1980 ; bekki & couch 2011 ) .",
    "it has been a key issue for galactic and extragalactic astronomy to understand the relative importance of each of these physical processes in the formation and evolution of galaxies with different masses and hubble types residing in different environments at a give cosmic time . in order to address this key issue ,",
    "many theoretical studies have tried to construct as realistic galaxy formation models as possible by using sophisticated numerical simulations .",
    "one of the missing elements in these previous numerical studies of galaxy formation and evolution is interstellar dust .",
    "the efficient conversion from neutral to molecular hydrogen ( @xmath0 ) is possible on the surface of dust grains ( e.g. , gould & salpeter 1963 ; hollenbach & salpeter 1971 ) , and thermodynamical evolution of ism and interstellar chemistry are also controlled by dust ( e.g. herbst 2002 ) .",
    "furthermore , fragmentation processes of metal - poor gas clouds can be significantly influenced by dust abundances so that dust can be very important for the formation of low - mass stars in the early universe ( e.g. , larson 2005 ; schneider & omukai 2010 ) . in spite of these importance of dust ,",
    "dust - related physical processes have not been self - consistently included in almost all simulations of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the observed physical processes of dust properties in galaxies have been investigated so far by one - zone chemical evolution models ( e.g. , dwek 1998 , d98 ; lisenfeld & ferrara 1998 ; hirashita 1999 ; edmunds 2001 ; inoue 2003 ; calura et al .",
    "2008 ; asano et al . 2013 ; zhukovska & henning 2013 ; rowlands et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "bekki ( 2013a , 2015 ; b13a and b15 , respectively ) have first performed numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution which include self - consistently both ( i ) the formation , growth , and destruction processes of dust grains in asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , supernovae ( sne ) , and ism and ( ii ) @xmath0 formation on dust grains .",
    "thanks to the self - consistent modeling of dust physics , not only the cosmic evolution of dust but also the physical properties of galaxies ( e.g. , gas contents ) were compared with the latest observations ( e.g. , by herschel ) in b13a and b15 .",
    "these simulations are different from previous ones ( ferrara et al .",
    "1991 , f91 ; aguirre et al .",
    "2001 ) in which dust grains are represented by test particles ( i.e. , moving in a gravitational potential of a galaxy without influencing its host galaxy at all ) so that the influences of dust on galaxy formation and evolution can not be investigated .",
    "although our previous simulations made it possible for us to predict the cosmic evolution histories of dust abundances and distributions in galaxies , they have some problems in modeling dust .",
    "one key problem is that gas and dust are assumed to move exactly the same way in our previous simulations ( b13a , b15 ) : the simulated spatial distributions and kinematics are the same between gas and dust in galaxies .",
    "this could be a good approximation , given that the timescale of gas - dust frictional timescale is an order of @xmath1 yr for a typical range of ism properties ( e.g. , theis & orlova 2004 ) , which is much shorter than the dynamical timescales of most galaxies ( @xmath2 yr ) .",
    "however , as shown in previous theoretical works on dust evolution in galaxies , only dust can be expelled from galactic disks through the effects of radiation pressure of stars on dust ( e.g. , f91 ) . also , the observed flat distribution of halo dust ( mnard et al .",
    "2010 , m10 ) and the rather high dust - to - gas - ratio ( @xmath3 ) in m81 group ( e.g. , xilouris et al .",
    "2006 ) strongly suggest that the spatial distributions of dust can be quite different from those of gas in some galaxy environments .",
    "furthermore , chemical evolution of galaxies can be significantly influenced by dust removal from galaxies through radiation - driven winds ( bekki & tsujimoto 2014 ) , which implies that star formation processes in galaxies can be influenced by dust removal from galaxies owing to the processes dependent on dust and metal abundances .",
    "therefore , we would need to model dust removal processes in galaxies more self - consistently so that we can discuss the roles of dust in galaxy formation and evolution and the observed wide variety of dust properties of galaxies in a more comprehensive way .",
    "it would be a reasonable strategy for numerical studies of galaxy formation to treat gas and dust separately , because gas and dust respond differently to physical processes of ism .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to describe a new method by which dust - related physics can be more self - consistently included in nbody / hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "dust and gas are represented by separate live particles in the present new simulation code so that dust - related physical processes such as radiation pressure on dust and dust - gas interaction can be better investigated . since this is the very first paper discussing the possible roles of dust in galaxy formation based on a new type of galaxy evolution simulations , we focus mainly on the methods to include dust - related physics in nbody / hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "we briefly describe some key results of the new simulations , and we discuss extensively the possible roles of dust in galaxy formation and evolution in forthcoming papers .",
    "the present model is not only a more sophisticated version of previous models on the formation of dust wind ( e.g. , chiao & wickamasinghe 1972 ; f91 ) but also an improved version of previous galaxy evolution models for dusty galaxies .",
    "the important influences of radiation - driven dust wind on star - forming regions in galaxies have been recently discussed by a number of authors ( e.g. , thompson et al .",
    "2005 ; hopkins et al 2012 ) .",
    "these works , however , did not investigate the evolution of dust contents and the possibly separate distributions of gas and stars in a self - consistent manner . furthermore , previous models for spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of galaxies ( e.g. , bekki & shioya 2000 ; jonsson 2006 ) and for @xmath0 contents of galaxies ( e.g. , pelupessy et al .",
    "2006 ; krumholz et al .",
    "2009 ) assumed a fixed dust - to - metal ( @xmath4 ) ratio across the entire region of a simulated galaxy . such a fixed @xmath4 is neither observed ( e.g. , galametz et al .",
    "2011 ) nor realistic in theoretical modeling of dust evolution ( e.g. , inoue 2003 ) .",
    "therefore , the present model with variable @xmath4 in different local regions of a simulated galaxy can provide more detailed and accurate predictions on @xmath0 contents and seds of galaxies .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "first , we describe the details of the adopted new methods to implement dust - related physical processes in galaxy - scale chemodynamical simulations .",
    "then , we present some key results of the new simulations on the roles of dust in the evolution of star formation rates , dust distributions , and gas dynamics within galaxies in  3 . in this section , we also discuss how the present results depend on the physical parameters of the adopted new method for dust - related physics . in  4 , we discuss ( i ) the advantages and disadvantages of the present new method over previous ones and ( ii ) further improvement of the method in our future works .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  5 .",
    "although including dust - related physics in galaxy - scale nbody+hydrodynamical simulations is rather new in numerical studies of galaxy formation and evolution , there are already a number of more sophisticated simulations on the joint evolution of dust and gas in other areas of astronomy .",
    "for example , laibe & price ( 2014 ) have already included the gas - dust interaction for multiple dust components in their sph simulations that can be used for the investigation of planet formation and evolution .",
    "the methods and numerical techniques used in these simulations in other areas of astronomy would be useful in the present study .",
    "however , we do not discuss these , because this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we accordingly focus on the modeling issues of galaxy - scale chemodynamical simulations with dust physics .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ , < \" , ]      the present new four - component chemodynamical code will enable us to investigate various aspects of dust - affected galaxy formation and evolution across the comic time .",
    "the proposed live dust particle method will make it possible for us to discuss the different distributions of gas and dust in galaxies , the cosmic evolution of dust sizes and compositions , and the abundances of interstellar matters formed on dust grains .",
    "below , we briefly discuss what we can investigate by using the new simulation code ( the figure in appendix c would be useful for readers of this paper to understand the following discussion better ) .",
    "b15 failed to reproduce the observed flat profiles of dust halos of galaxies ( m10 ) , because the model adopted in b15 did not include dust - gas decoupling processes in ism ( e.g. , radiation pressure and dust - gas drag ) .",
    "furthermore , the observed rather high dust - to - gas - ratio ( @xmath3 , which is about 6 times larger than the solar neighborhood ) in the outer halo of m81 by xilouris et al .",
    "( 2006 ) was very difficult to be explained by b15 for the same reason .",
    "as shown in this paper , the radial density profile of dust in a galaxy can be flattened by the effects of radiation pressure of stars ( thus the outer halo can have higher @xmath5 ) .",
    "therefore , it is doubtlessly worthwhile for our future studies to investigate whether such an important effect of radiation pressure can be clearly achieved in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "the present chemodynamical model includes the six key dust - related physical processes of galaxies , i.e. , dust formation , mixing , growth , destruction , consumption , and catalysis .",
    "the formation of @xmath0 on dust grains is one of important interstellar chemistry processes on dust grains ( catalysis ) that can be discussed in the present study .",
    "the present new live dust particle method combined with the proposed four - component galaxy model ( dm+stars+gas+dust ) can predict dust and gas 3d distributions separately and distributions and kinematics of different dust species ( e.g. , agb and sn dust ) separately too .",
    "however , the live particle method is still less realistic in modeling some aspects of dusty ism , such as the size evolution of dust and the coagulation process of dust .",
    "the bottleneck of the new method is that the total number of dust particles can endlessly increase if the formation of dust with different sizes and components in star - forming regions and evolved stars is considered in a fully self - consistent manner .",
    "this means that the cpu / gpu time required for the calculation of dust physics at each time step of a simulation can become progressively longer as the simulation proceeds .",
    "the total number of dust particles ejected from a single stellar particle ( @xmath6 ) is 3 in the present study so that the total number of particles ( @xmath7 ) can not dramatically increase .",
    "however , if we investigate the time evolution of dust sizes , @xmath6 would possibly need to be more than @xmath8 to represent a statistically enough sample of dust grains with different sizes .",
    "this means that we need to develop a fast algorism for calculating the dust - related physics of ism in a simulation in order to consider the dust size evolution in a self - consistent manner .",
    "constructing the seds for arbitrary 3d geometries of gas , dust , and stars in galaxies based on theoretical and numerical models of galaxy formation has been one of key ares of theoretical studies of galaxies ( e.g. , bekki & shioya 2000 , 2001 ; jonsson 2006 ; popescu & tuffs 2013 ) .",
    "these simulated seds and those based on some phenomenological models ( e.g. , dale et al .",
    "2001 ) are very useful in interpreting the observed energy budgets ( e.g. , fraction of infrared light ) of dusty star - forming galaxies . in order to estimate seds from ssps ( e.g. , bruzual & charlot 2003 ) , the previous studies needed to assume ( i ) dust - to - metal - ratios ( to drive dust abundances from gas metallicities ) and ( ii ) dust size distribution ( for deriving the dust extinction curves ) .",
    "if our future simulations with the new live dust particle method can predict dust size distributions properly , then they do not have to adopt the above assumption ( ii ) ( the above ( i ) is explicitly derived in the present code already ) .",
    "thus , the self - consistent construction of seds based on dust size evolution will be possible in our future studies .      although the gas - phase metallicity ( that does not include dust - phase metal ) of a gas particle should be used for estimating the radiation cooling rate of the gas in numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution , the total ism metallicity ( i.e. , gas - phase + dust - phase metal ) has been used in almost all simulations for cooling estimation , because dust was not included in the simulations .",
    "although the present new model properly considered this dust - corrected cooling process , it did not include the possible time - dependent imf , which can cause significant changes in dust evolution , star formation histories , and chemical evolution of galaxies ( e.g. , bekki 2013b ; recchi & kroupa 2015 ) .",
    "furthermore , the present study did not consider the radiative cooling rates that depend on both [ fe / h ] on [ mg / fe ] ( de rijcke et al . 2013 ) thus on the detailed chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "given that the dust - depletion levels are quite different between different elements ( e.g. , mg , fe , and ca ) , the present results might be changed to some extent if the cooling rates by de rijcke et al .",
    "( 2013 ) are adopted .",
    "thus our future studies will need to include both temporal and spatial variations of imfs and more sophisticated cooling models ( de rijcke et al .",
    "2013 ) in order to model the thermal and dynamical evolution of ism regulated dust in a more self - consistent way .",
    "the present study has introduced a new parameter for the mass fraction of dust destroyed by sne ( @xmath9 ) . in the simulation code , the dust particles that are within less than @xmath10 ( destruction radius ) from a sn are assumed to be destroyed and consequently lose some fraction ( @xmath9 ) of dust .",
    "since a cluster of stars is formed from a gas particle , the previous results based on a model for dust destruction by a single sn can not be simply used in the present model . given",
    "that @xmath9 can control chemical evolution of galaxies , the possible range of @xmath9 in star - forming gas clouds with multiple sne exploding at different epochs needs to be investigated in our future simulations .",
    "the mixing radius ( @xmath11 ) of ejected metals from sne and agb stars and the dust destruction radius ( @xmath10 ) are set to be the same in the present study .",
    "the appropriate values for @xmath11 and @xmath10 are determined from the adopted spatial resolution of a simulation ( i.e. , from @xmath12 ) . however , these two could be significantly different , because dust destruction processes might be more sensitive to physical properties of ism ( e.g. , magnetic fields and gas shock speed ; jones et al .",
    "this means that we need to perform high - resolution sub - pc scale numerical simulations on the dynamical evolution of dust and metals ejected from sne and agb stars in galactic potentials .",
    "the outputs from such simulations will be able to be included in larger galaxy - scale simulations so that we can investigate the dust - regulated galaxy formation and evolution for reasonable ranges of @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "although we have so far focused on the formation of @xmath0 on dust grains , the surface of grains in ism is crucial for the formation and evolution of many different interstellar species ( as ` catalysis ' ) , such as ice and organic matter ( e.g. , herbst & van dishoeck 2009 ) .",
    "accordingly , the present new dust particle methods will enable us to predict the formation efficiency of many different species other than @xmath0 by considering physical conditions of gas and dust and chemistry on dust grains . as a dust particle moves in ism of a galaxy , the dust temperature , the collision rates of atoms and molecules , the strength of isrf , and other physical properties of dust and ism can change .",
    "if these time evolution of the physical properties of the dust and its environments can be investigated by our future simulations , we will be able to predict the time evolution of interstellar species ( e.g. , organic matter ) .",
    "given that recent infrared observations have already shown different abundances of @xmath13 and @xmath14 ices in different galaxies ( e.g. , shimonishi et al .",
    "2010 ) , this prediction is something that we should do not in far future but in near future , though the modeling of @xmath13 and @xmath14 ices might be a formidable task .",
    "we have developed a new four - component model of galaxy evolution in which a galaxy consists of dark matter , stars , gas , and dust .",
    "the dust component is represented by live dust particles so that the present new model enables us to investigate separately the evolution of gas and dust.the dust particles are live in the following three senses .",
    "firstly , dust particles can gravitationally interact not only with other components ( e.g. , dark matter ) but also with other dust particles . secondly",
    ", dust can be destroyed by sne and reduce significantly its mass , and also it can grow by accretion of gas - phase metals in ism .",
    "thirdly , dust grains can be the formation sites of water , organic compounds , and amino acid closely related to the origin of life , and accordingly we can study the evolution of these interstellar matter essential for life by using our new simulations in future .",
    "first we have described the details of the model and discussed the limitations and advantages of the model in investigating galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "we then have investigated the possible roles of dust in galaxy evolution by using the new code and obtained some preliminary results .",
    "in particular , we have tried to grasp the possible roles of stellar radiation pressure on dust grains in the evolution of dust , gas - phase metals , and star formation histories ( sfhs ) of galaxies .",
    "the preliminary results that we have obtained in this study are briefly summarized as follows : + ( 1 ) the radiation pressure of stars on dust in disk galaxies can influence the time evolution of 3d dust distributions .",
    "dust particles in a disk galaxy can be levitated from the initially thin disk and some fractions of dust can escape from the disk to locate outside the virial radius of its dark matter halo .",
    "this dynamical evolution of dust derived by stellar radiation strongly depends on the model parameters such as stellar ages ( @xmath15 ) , total dust extinction ( @xmath16 ) , dust composition ( e.g. , silicate or graphite ) , and frequency - averaged radiation pressure coefficient ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "+ ( 2 ) the two basic roles of stellar radiation in the time evolution of 3d dust distributions are ( i ) thickening of the vertical structure of dust and ( ii ) flattening of the radial density profile .",
    "the above four parameters ( e.g. , @xmath16 ) can determine the degrees of these thickening and flattening in the mass distributions of dust .",
    "for example , the models with higher @xmath16 show a smaller degree of flattening in the dust distribution whereas those with younger disk ages ( i.e. , smaller @xmath15 ) show a larger degree of the flattening .",
    "+ ( 3 ) stellar radiation pressure can reduce the mass density of dust in a galactic disk so that it can also reduce the @xmath0 formation efficiency on dust grains . as a result of this , the star formation rate ( sfr )",
    "can be severely reduced with the reduction level depending largely on @xmath16 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that this suppression of star formation by stellar radiation pressure is due to the adopted assumption that sfrs depend on the mass density of @xmath0 gas ( not the total gas density ) in the present study .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the level of sf suppression by radiation pressure is overestimated in the present study .",
    "+ ( 4 ) the inclusion of other dust - related physical processes , such as photo - electric heating and gas - dust heating , does not change the present results on the roles of stellar radiation pressure in galaxy evolution .",
    "it is found that photo - electric heating can suppress galaxy - wide star formation in the models with and without radiation pressure .",
    "furthermore , gaseous drag of dust can lead to the slight enhancement of galactic sfrs , because the drag can prevent dust from escaping from thin galactic disks .",
    "we need to confirm these interesting effects of dust on galactic sfhs in our future studies by exploring a much wider parameter space for dust - related physical processes . + ( 5 ) one of the most important parameters for the evolution of dust and metal abundances is @xmath9 , which is defined as the mass fraction of interstellar dust that is destroyed by sne in a star - forming gas cloud .",
    "although a possibly reasonable value of @xmath9 is @xmath18 in the present study , this parameter is yet to be constrained so well by observational and theoretical studies . given its importance , it is our future study to determine the possible range of @xmath9 and its dependence on the physical properties of star - forming gas clouds .",
    "+ ( 6 ) the present results suggest that although dust does not influence galaxy evolution so dramatically as sn and agn feedback effects do , it can play significant roles in many aspects of galaxy formation and evolution . for example , the removal of metals through dust wind , suppression of @xmath0 formation due to dust removal , and photo - electric heating of gas by dust in ism can influence chemical evolution , star formation histories , and stellar and gas dynamics in galaxies , respectively . these roles of dust in galaxy formation and evolution will need to be investigated extensively in future theoretical studies of galaxies for better understanding the formation and evolution processes of galaxies . +",
    "thus the present new live dust particle method has enabled us to reveal the possible influences of dust - related physical processes on galaxy evolution .",
    "the dust properties of galaxies have been derived in the post - processing of simulation data for almost all previous theoretical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution ( e.g. , derivation of dust mass from metal mass by assuming dust - to - metal ratios ) .",
    "the present study suggests that this post - processing approach might not be realistic because dust itself can cause significant changes in galaxy evolution processes .",
    "the present new model is still somewhat idealized ( e.g. , non - inclusion of dust size distributions in ism ) and therefore needs to be further improved so that we can properly investigate the physical properties of dust ( e.g. , evolving dust compositions and sizes ) as well as their effects on galaxy formation and evolution , in particular , the evolution of galactic seds and molecular gas fraction . in our next paper",
    ", we will discuss how galaxy formation processes can be influenced by dust in a @xmath19cdm cosmology by using a more sophisticated live dust particle model .",

    "in the present live dust particle method , the formation of @xmath0 is possible only on the surface of dust grains in galactic ism .",
    "accordingly , the time evolution of @xmath20 and sfhs of galaxies depend on the dynamical evolution of dust .",
    "it is therefore possible that the present results on @xmath20 evolution and sfhs of galaxies depend on the total number of dust particles ( @xmath21 ) adopted in the present simulations . in order to investigate this important issue",
    ", we have run four comparative mw - type disk models without stellar radiation pressure and different @xmath21 and investigated whether the results depend on @xmath21 .",
    "a1 shows that the sfrs in mw - type disk galaxies do not depend strongly on @xmath21 as long as @xmath22 ( 30% of the total gas particle number ) .",
    "the model with @xmath23 appears to underestimate the sfr in the initial bursty star formation in the central region of the disk .",
    "it is confirmed that the final spatial distributions of dust does not depend strongly on @xmath21 either .",
    "this weak dependence on @xmath21 is very encouraging , because we do not have to adopt an excessively large number of dust particles to simulate the dust evolution of galaxies .",
    "thus we conclude that the adopted number of @xmath21 is enough to investigate the possible roles of dust in galaxy evolution .",
    "dust growth via accretion of gas - phase metals onto already existing dust grains and and dust destruction by sne are both assumed to proceed locally depending on the physical conditions of ism in the present study . in order to implement these processes ,",
    "we have introduced a new parameter @xmath24 that defines the sphere of influence within which the dust accretion and destruction rates are calculated for each dust particle based on the physical properties of gas around the dust particle .",
    "since the present results can possibly depend strongly on this @xmath24 , we need to investigate the possible dependence .",
    "b1 clearly shows that galactic sfhs are qualitatively very similar between the mw - type disk models with four different @xmath24 , though the sfrs at a given time step are slightly different between the four models .",
    "this is again encouraging , because we can estimate a reasonable @xmath24 from the adopted gravitational softening length ( corresponding to the initial spatial resolution ) of a simulation .",
    "however , this rather weak dependence on @xmath24 might be true only for the present galaxy evolution simulations for isolated disks .",
    "thus , we need to confirm whether this is the case for other models such as galaxy formation models based on a @xmath19cdm cosmology .",
    "c1 briefly summarizes the key elements of the new four - component chemodynamical model adopted in the present numerical study of galaxy evolution .",
    "the six key physical processes included in the code are ( i ) mixing of metals and dust ejected from sne and agb stars , ( ii ) dust formation from condensation of metals in stellar winds of sne and agb stars , ( iii ) dust growth through accretion of gas - phase metals onto already existing dust grains , ( iv ) dust destruction by sne , ( v ) @xmath0 formation on dust grains from neutral hydrogen ( catalysis ) , and ( vi ) consumption of gas and dust by star formation in molecular clouds in galaxies .",
    "the new model is quite different from previous standard three - component chemodynamical model in the sense that ( i ) dust - related physical processes are explicitly and self - consistently included and ( ii ) influences of dust evolution on chemical evolution of gas - phase metals is considered .",
    "the improved predictability of the new code is discussed extensively in the main text ."

    "<S> interstellar dust plays decisive roles in the conversion of neutral to molecular hydrogen ( @xmath0 ) , the thermodynamical evolution of interstellar medium ( ism ) , and the modification of spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> these important roles of dust have not been self - consistently included in previous numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we have therefore developed a new model by which one can investigate whether and how galaxy formation and evolution can be influenced by dust - related physical processes such as photo - electric heating , @xmath0 formation on dust , and stellar radiation pressure on dust in detail . </S>",
    "<S> a novel point of the model is that different dust species in a galaxy are represented by ` live dust ' particles ( i.e. , not test particles ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , dust particles in a galaxy not only interact gravitationally with all four components of the galaxy ( i.e. , dark matter , stars , gas , and dust ) but also are grown and destroyed through physical processes of ism . </S>",
    "<S> first we describe a way to include dust - related physical processes in nbody+hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy evolution in detail . </S>",
    "<S> then we show some preliminary results of dust - regulated galaxy evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the preliminary results suggest that the evolution of dust distributions driven by radiation pressure of stars is very important for the evolution of star formation rates , chemical abundances , @xmath0 fractions , and gas distributions in galaxies .    </S>",
