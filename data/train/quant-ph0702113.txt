    "squeezing has received continued attention since the early eighties loudon87,meystre91,drummond04 because it is a beautiful quantum phenomenon with amazing potential applications @xcite , the most recent of which are connected with continuous variable quantum information braunstein05 .",
    "one particular aspect of squeezing that is receiving more attention at present is polarization squeezing , probably because its detection does not need homodyning , as it is the case with quadrature squeezing , i.e. , photodetectors suffice for detecting polarization squeezing @xcite . here",
    "we are concerned with the study of both quadrature and polarization squeezing in the field exiting a particular nonlinear optical cavity .",
    "one system that attracted early attention for quadrature squeezing is dispersive optical bistability drummond80b , vogel , lugiatoob , orozco87,wallsmilburn which consists in an optical cavity filled with a nonlinear @xmath0 medium which is fed with an external ( pumping ) field . for appropriate values of the system parameters ,",
    "the output field exhibits bistability and at the turning points of the hysteresis cycle , perfect squeezing is obtained .",
    "here we revisit this system because we are interested not only in quadrature but also in polarization squeezing .",
    "the generalization of this simple dispersive optical bistability model we consider in this article consists in taking into account the existence , inside the optical cavity , of a mode with orthogonal polarization with respect to that of the pumping field , which is also close to cavity resonance . for low pump , this extra mode remains empty , i.e. , the output cavity field has the same polarization as the pumping field , but for large enough pump this orthogonally polarized mode can switch on ( what is known as polarization instability ) and then the field exiting the cavity changes from linearly to elliptically polarized .",
    "this system is known as vectorial kerr cavity @xcite and its mathematical modeling consists in taking into account self and cross  phase modulation , as well as four  wave mixing , for the two orthogonally polarized intracavity modes , the weight of each of the three nonlinear processes depending on the particular nonlinear medium under consideration @xcite .",
    "the vectorial kerr cavity has been studied in the past from the viewpoints of stability theory @xcite and pattern formation geddes94,hoyuelos98,gallego00,sanchez00b , perez00 .",
    "also quantum fluctuations have been studied in this system but , as far as we know , only from the perspective of pattern formation @xcite , i.e. , by considering a continuum of transverse modes .",
    "here we consider the single transverse mode model and study quadrature and polarization squeezing in the field exiting the nonlinear cavity .",
    "as we show below , the vectorial kerr cavity exhibits polarization squeezing .",
    "in particular , and most interestingly , this polarization squeezing is optimum at the bistability bifurcation points , when the orthogonally polarized field is off . thus the vectorial kerr cavity model , which can be taken as a more accurate model of dispersive optical bistability , reveals that this well known process can act as a polarization squeezer .",
    "the rest of the article is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii  we derive the langevin equations for quantum fluctuations from the quantum hamiltonian of a kerr cavity pumped by a linearly polarized coherent field , which are derived from the fokker ",

    "iii , in order to keep in mind the scenario of the different solutions exhibited by the system , their classical stationary solutions are given and their stability properties are briefly reviewed .",
    "the linearized langevin equations around the semiclassical stationary solutions and the spectrum of quantum fluctuations are introduced in sec .",
    "v is devoted to the analysis of quadrature squeezing .",
    "then , in section vi quantum stokes operators and the definition of polarization squeezing are introduced . in sec .",
    "vii we state specifically the relation between the stokes parameters variances and the quadrature squeezing spectra and analyze polarization squeezing in this system , paying special attention to the squeezing occurring at the bifurcations affecting the linearly polarized solution , but considering also polarization squeezing in the elliptically polarized solution in a particular case . finally , in sec .",
    "viii we show the most relevant conclusions of our work .",
    "consider an optical cavity filled with an isotropic kerr medium and assume that cavity losses occur only at one of the cavity mirrors being the same for all possible field polarizations ( i.e. , assume that the cavity is also isotropic ) .",
    "an external laser field , whose frequency is far enough from any resonance in the nonlinear medium ( what makes possible that the interaction be described by a real cubic nonlinear susceptibility ) is injected into the cavity .",

    "it is also obvious that there can be states with some @xmath167 which are not polarization squeezed states : think of a state with @xmath168 for some @xmath163 and @xmath167 .",

    ". then the quantum vacuum is not a reference for defining the squeezed polarization state .",
    "these are the reasons why polarization squeezing is defined in a different way :  a field state is said to be squeezed if @xcite @xmath169for some @xmath170 , i.e. , a polarization squeezed state is a state for which the variance of one of the stokes parameters lies not only below the coherent limit , but also below the corresponding minimum uncertainty state limit . in a state",
    "verifying such a condition there is a rearrangement of quantum fluctuations between the different stokes parameters and is thus a proper squeezed state .",
    "we shall adopt the above criterion ( [ sq ] ) but we must mention that there has been some debate concerning the most appropriate criterion for polarization squeezing and we refer the reader to korolkova02,heersink03,luis06 and references therein .",
    "as stated , the polarization squeezing properties of light are provided by the knowledge of the variances of the quantum stokes operators . as we commented in the previous section , polarization and quadrature squeezing",
    "are not equivalent , and a quadrature squeezed state does not imply necessarily a polarized squeezed state .",

    "we see below that the cross - mode spectra ( [ defcross ] ) differentiates the polarization squeezing from a simple combination of quadrature spectra .    after lengthy but straightforward algebra",
    "one obtains that the variances of the quantum stokes operators  can be written as    @xmath171    @xmath172    @xmath173    @xmath174    where @xmath175 and @xmath176 correspond to the steady state values given by eqs .",

    "contrarily , the two last stokes parameters correspond to the quadrature fluctuations of the non  emitting ( orthogonal ) mode @xmath73 at the particular quadrature angles @xmath181 and @xmath182 .    in this case , i.e. , at the bifurcations , we can give the explicit expressions of the @xmath183 that read    @xmath184    where    @xmath185    with @xmath186 and @xmath187 , as introduced in eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) , and where @xmath120 is normalized to @xmath30",
    ". now the above expressions must be particularized for the different possible bifurcations affecting the singlemode solution .",
    "we must now take into account that as @xmath115 at the bifurcations , at these points the mean values of the stokes parameters are @xmath188 and @xmath189 , and then eq .",
    "( [ sq ] ) implies that the only stokes parameters that can be squeezed are @xmath190 and @xmath191 , and for that they must verify    @xmath192      in this case @xmath121 , eq .",
    "( [ ipolarization ] ) and it is not difficult to show that neither @xmath190 nor @xmath191 are squeezed .",
    "we saw in subsection 5.1 that optimum quadrature squeezing occurs at this bifurcation for @xmath193 with @xmath194 tending to @xmath195 for @xmath196 and to @xmath126 for @xmath137 .",
    "it is immediately seen from this that only for @xmath196 it could happen that @xmath197 be squeezed , see eqs .",
    "( [ vstokesmono ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ psi ] ) , but it turns out that this never occurs for finite values of the detuning because , as commented in subsection 5.1 , the squeezing level is extremely sensitive to the @xmath198 value . then there is not any polarization squeezing at this bifurcation .      in this case",
    "@xmath199 , eq . ( [ ibistability ] ) .",
    "the fact the optimum quadrature squeezing for the field @xmath73 occurs for @xmath200 , see subsection 5.2 , makes that @xmath191 be squeezed , see eqs .",
    "( [ vstokesmono ] ) .",
    "then in this particular case quadrature squeezing implies polarization squeezing . in fig .",
    "9 we represent the optimum ( minimum )  value of @xmath191 at the two bistability bifurcations , which occurs at the frequencies given in subsection 5.2 .      in this subsection",
    "we study the dependence of fluctuations on pump intensity for a particular value of the detuning .",
    "we have chosen @xmath201 as for this value the only bifurcation suffered by the singlemode solution is the polarization bifurcation ( remember that @xmath202 for bistability exists ) and thus there is not polarization squeezing at the bifurcation ( section vii.a.1 ) .",
    "furthermore , from @xcite we know that for @xmath201 there is not any secondary bifurcation affecting the bimode solution .",
    "we concentrate on the fluctuations of the stokes parameters of the bimode solution . in fig .",
    "10 the steady state intensity as well as the mean values of the stokes parameters are represented as a function of pump , and in fig .",
    "11 the minimum value of the variances of the stokes parameters are represented together with the mean values of the stokes parameters .",
    "we do not find it necessary to indicate at which frequency the minimum value of the variances is reached .",
    "notice that polarization squeezing occurs when the represented variances fall below the mean value of the appropriate stokes parameter , which is the one that is shown in each figure , see eq .",
    "( [ sq ] ) .",
    "we see that in spite of the fact that no polarization squeezing exists at the bifurcation , as commented in the previous subsection , as pump is increased parameters @xmath203 and @xmath204 are squeezed within some pump value ranges ( we note that @xmath205 increases its value for pump values larger than those represented in the figure ) .",
    "the observed polarization squeezing must be attributed in this case to the effect of the cross ",
    "mode spectra in eqs .",
    "( [ v ] ) .",
    "we would like to note that in spite of the fact that there is always some parameter for which @xmath206 , see fig .",
    "although this is not polarization squeezing @xcite , it is a fact that the output field exhibits less fluctuations than a coherent state and this could also be useful as it is a form of intensity squeezing .",
    "these results are shown just to illustrate that the vectorial kerr cavity exhibits polarization squeezing not only at the bifurcations and we have checked that this happens for other parameter values .",
    "as the behavior of the bimode solution can be quite involved we do not find it necessary to go in our analysis beyond this point .",
    "in this article we have studied quadrature and polarization squeezing in a vectorial kerr cavity model . after deriving langevin equations for the quantum fluctuations from a suitable fokker ",
    "planck equation , namely that of the generalized p ",
    "distribution , we have derived expressions for the quantum fluctuations of the output field quadratures as a function of which we have expressed the spectrum of fluctuations of the output field stokes parameters .",
    "these last expressions are particularly useful for understanding the connection between quadrature and polarization squeezing and facilitate the study of the latter .    through the analysis of the quadrature and polarization fluctuations spectra",
    ", we have analyzed the conditions under which squeezing occur .",
    "we have concentrated mainly on the squeezing occurring at the bifurcations affecting the singlemode ( linearly polarized ) solution , but have considered also polarization squeezing in the bimode ( elliptically polarized ) solution in a particular case .",
    "in particular we have demonstrated that polarization squeezing occurs in this system , being specially large in the upper tangent ( bistability ) bifurcation of the singlemode solution .    although the results we have shown have been derived for particular values of the maker ",
    "terhune coefficients ( namely corresponding to the case of liquids ) , we have analyzed also other cases and have convinced ourselves that our results are qualitatively general : except for the case @xmath207 ( that describes isotropic media in which the kerr nonlinearity is solely due to electrostiction ) in which the field @xmath73 is a coherent vacuum irrespective of the pump value ( the polarization instability does not exists in this case ) , for any @xmath208 there exists polarization squeezing at the tangent bifurcations ( of course the amount of squeezing does depend on the particular @xmath17 value ) .    from these results we conclude that the vectorial kerr cavity model ( including both cross  phase modulation and four  wave mixing of the two orthogonally polarized intracavity modes ) constitutes a particularly interesting generalization of the standard dispersive bistability model from the point of view of quantum fluctuations , as it predicts the existence of polarization squeezing , a phenomenon that , obviously , can not be described with the standard model , and that exists whenever four  wave mixing occurs ( i.e. , whenever @xmath208 ) .",
    "it is particularly interesting that polarization squeezing occurs in the singlemode solution , being optimum at the tangent ( bistability ) bifurcations , i.e. without the need of reaching the polarization bifurcation .",
