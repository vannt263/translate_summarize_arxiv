    "transient black hole x - ray binaries ( bhxbs ) are the best laboratories to study the physics of the accretion flow in a wide range of the mass accretion rate .",
    "they make drastic changes in spectral properties during their outburst while exhibiting orders of magnitude increase and decrease of their x - ray luminosity , suggesting that the geometry of inner disk differs significantly according to the mass accretion rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in low x - ray luminosity phases ,",
    "they show a relatively hard , power - law shaped spectrum with a photon index of less than 2.0 and an exponential cutoff at @xmath2100 kev , which is generally interpreted as the disk emission comptonized by thermal electrons in the surrounding corona .",
    "this state is called `` low / hard state '' , in which the inner part of standard disk @xcite is thought to be truncated .",
    "following the rapid increase of the x - ray luminosity in outbursts , they undergo a state transition to the so - called `` high / soft state '' typically at a mass accretion rate of @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the eddington luminosity : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 represent the gravitational constant , proton mass , speed of light , black hole mass , and thomson scattering cross - section , respectively ) , in which the soft x - ray flux is dominated by thermal emission from the standard accretion disk .",
    "many previous studies showed that the inner disk radius stays constant during the high / soft state ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this suggests that the disk extends down to the inner most stable circular orbit ( hereafter isco ) in the high / soft state .",
    "the properties of fast time variabilities are also remarkably different between the low / hard state and the high / soft state . in the low / hard state ,",
    "bhxbs show noisy light curves on time scales of up to hundred seconds .",
    "their power density spectra ( pdss ) are roughly characterized with the so - called band limited noise with flat profile in the @xmath11 spectrum ( @xmath12 ) within the low and high frequency break , below and above which the power declines as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "this noise profile is better described as a superposition of multiple lorentzians @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that these structures are reproduced by the superposition of `` shots '' ( flare like events ) seen in the low / hard state light curve , which are thought to be related to density fluctuation of advection - dominated accretion flow inside the inner edge of the standard disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in contrast , rapid variability is typically weak in the high / soft state , where the constant standard disk emission dominates the x - ray flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the low - frequency break of the band - limited noise seen in the low / hard state moves toward higher frequencies as the x - ray luminosity increases , and the profile of pds is smoothly connected to those in the high / soft state through the intermediate or very high state @xcite .",
    "these characteristics support the idea that the standard disk is truncated and the inner edge moves inward to reach isco as the luminosity increases @xcite .",
    "bhxbs with a relatively high inclination angle are particularly interesting objects because they give us key information to uncover the structure of the outer accretion disk . in the high / soft state , these sources often exhibit",
    "highly ionized blue - shifted absorption lines that originate in the `` disk wind '' outflowing from the outer region of the accretion disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "importantly , the mass loss rate of a disk wind is comparable with or even several to a few dozens times larger than the mass accretion rate @xcite , which suggests that the disk wind would also affect the properties of inner region of the disk and play a critical role on accretion disk physics .",
    "high inclination x - ray binary systems often show quasi - periodic dips accompanied by spectral hardening in their light curves .",
    "it is generally believed that the dips are caused by absorption of the x - ray emission from the central source with dense structure in outer disks such as the `` bulge '' , which is formed by the accretion stream from the companion star impacting the rim of the disk ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "previous studies showed that dipping spectra are well reproduced by a partial absorption by neutral material ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "while this approach was successfully applied in many sources including both neutron star and black hole x - ray binaries , another explanation has recently been proposed ; @xcite and @xcite successfully described both non - dipping and dipping spectra of neutron - star low mass x - ray binaries , using a single photo - ionized absorption model with different column densities and ionization parameters . it is suggested that absorption dips are generally caused by ionized gas of lower ionization state and higher column density than the disk winds ( see section  5.2 ) .",

    "the monitoring results with the gsc suggest that the source is likely a black hole x - ray binary , as its hardness - intensity diagram showed a q - shaped hysteresis over the whole outburst and the spectrum during the soft phase is well modelled with thermal emission from the standard disk like those of typical bhxbs in the high / soft state @xcite .",
    "a lot of follow - up observations were triggered in x - ray and other wavelengths .",

    "we can see two dipping features with different mean hardness ratios ( @xmath2510 for the softer ones and @xmath22030 for the harder ones ) , in which more than 80% of the averaged flux is lost in the soft band , and those dips with similar mean hardness ratios are observed almost periodically .",
    "here we define the start and end times of the dips as the points at which the hardness ratio crosses a value to 2.6 upward and downward in fig .",

    "the durations of the deep and shallow dips ( 1.01.7 hours ) are comparable or larger than those of the data gaps .",
    "because the hardness ratio never exceeds 2.6 outside of the dip phases we identified , it is unlikely that the actual period is shorter than 9.74 hours and we miss other dip events in these data gaps .",
    "we also note that dips do not always appear precisely in the same orbital phase , and the interval between the first and second deep dips actually 50 sec longer than that of second and third deep dips , when we measure them from the light curve with shorter time bins . the interval from a deep dip to the next shallow dip",
    "is derived to be @xmath26 hours , which is obtained by averaging the intervals between the beginning of deep dips and those of the following shallow dips .",
    "the durations of the deep and shallow dips , however , are not precisely constant , and consequently their intervals are slightly different event by event .",

    "we find that the softer energy band has much larger power than those of the harder bands in the frequency range of @xmath27 to @xmath28 hz .",

    "the covering fraction @xmath46 in the shallow dip can be understood as the filling factor of blobs in the dipping zone .",
    "interestingly , similar short - time variability was also found in the neutron star xb 1254@xmath15690 @xcite , suggesting that shallow dips in dipping x - ray binaries may generally consist of clumps .",
    "by contrast , in the deep dip , short - time variabilities are not significant and the covering fraction is larger than 90% , suggesting that the absorber of the deep dip has more continuous structure or is filled with much smaller blobs than those of the shallow dip .    we have shown that both non - dip and dip spectra of maxi  j1305@xmath15704 obtained with _",
    "suzaku _ are successfully modeled by ionized absorbers with different column densities and ionization parameters .",
    "the dip spectra have an order of magnitude larger hydrogen column densities and smaller ionization parameters than those of the non - dip spectrum .",
    "these results are very similar to those reported by @xcite and @xcite for neutron star low mass x - ray binaries .",
    "thus , it may be a general picture in low - mass x - ray binaries that dips are created by ionized absorbers with much larger column densities and in lower ionization states than those observed in non - dip spectra .",
    "the _ suzaku _ non - dip spectrum of maxi  j1305@xmath15704 is approximated by a power - law extending up to 130 kev with a photon index of @xmath227 .",
    "this hard spectrum indicates that the source was in the low / hard state . by more detailed modeling",
    ", we find that the spectrum can be described with a general model in the low / hard state of bhxbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a multicolor disk and its comptonization with a reflection component from the disk .",
    "although recent _ suzaku _ studies on other bhxbs report that two comptonization components with different optical depths are needed to reproduce their spectra in the low / hard state @xcite , our data do not require the second component .",
    "the reason is unclear , but it may be because the large inclination of maxi  j1305@xmath15704 makes it difficult to detect the softer component ( i.e. , with a small optical depth ) than the other systems , although it may be partially due to the poor statistics of our data .",
    "the smooth spectral profile of maxi j1305@xmath15704 without any complex comptonized component required , as well as the relatively weak time variability below @xmath299 hz ( see section 5.1 ) are unusual and interesting properties for a bhxb in the low / hard state .",
    "we obtained a much larger normalization ( @xmath300 ) and smaller temperature ( @xmath48 kev ) of the direct mcd component than those obtained with the _ swift_/xrt spectrum in the high / soft state . assuming that the comptonizated corona is isotropic and that the total number of photons from the disk is conserved after reprocessed by comptonization",
    ", we obtain the following equation @xcite ; @xmath301   \\left ( \\frac{t_{\\rm in}}{1\\mbox { kev } } \\right)^3 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\mbox { photons } { \\rm s}^{-1 } \\mbox { } { \\rm cm}^{-2 } , \\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath302 and @xmath303 are the 0.01100 kev photon flux from the disk and thermal comptonized component , respectively .",
    "we estimate the flux of the nthcomp component as @xmath304 photons @xmath19 sec@xmath16 and that of diskbb component as @xmath305 photons @xmath19 sec@xmath16 . using equation  [ eq1 ]",
    ", we estimate the innermost disk radius of @xmath306 km , ( where @xmath307 is the distance in unit of 6 kpc ) . the actual radius is derived to be @xmath308 km , by multiplying 1.19 , a correction factor of the boundary condition and spectral hardening @xcite .",
    "we compare the inner disk radius in the _ suzaku _ and _ swift _ observations , using the intrinsic flux of the mcd component .",
    "although the absolute radius obtained from the _ swift _ result may be affected by the strong beaming effects , we are able to discuss the relative difference of the radius between the two epochs . using the diskbb normalization obtained with the xrt spectrum ( @xmath118 ) and multiplying the correction factor 1.19 @xcite",
    ", we derive the inner disk radius as @xmath309 km .",
    "thus , the inner radius obtained from the best - fit model of _ suzaku _ data , @xmath310 km is 5.88.8 times larger than that from the xrt result .",
    "thus , we robustly conclude that the inner radius increased in the _ suzaku _ observation , giving strong evidence for disk truncation in the low / hard state .",
    "we find significant broad emission - line like residuals at @xmath2 0.7 kev and @xmath2 1.2 kev in the _",
    "swift_/xrt spectrum , which can not be reduced by multiple ionized absorptions , partial covering , emission components from the absorber itself .",
    "also , these residuals are not completely explained by changing the elemental abundances in the neutral and ionized absorbers .",
    "it is difficult to know what makes these structures . because they are not seen in the suzaku spectra in the low / hard state , their origin",
    "would be associated with the geometry of the accretion disk and/or the ionized absorbers in the high / soft state .",
    "similar features at @xmath2 0.7 kev were reported in several ultracompact low mass x - ray binaries ( ucxbs ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which have very short orbital periods ( less than about 80 minutes ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite recently suggested that the structures seen in ucxbs are the relativistically broadened oviii ly@xmath72 line created by reflection on the disk in the vicinity of the accretor with an ionization parameter of @xmath311 .",
    "likewise , the residuals in maxi  j1305@xmath15704 might be originated from reflection on ionized accretion disk in the strong gravitational field created by the central black hole .",
    "indeed , we find a relativistic emission line model laor instead of gaussian can also give an acceptable fit ( @xmath312 ) by assuming an inclination of @xmath229 , inner radius of @xmath313 ( corresponding to @xmath314 ) , outer radius of @xmath315 , and emissivity index ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the resulting line energy and equivalent width of the laor model are @xmath316 kev and @xmath317 ev for the lower energy feature and @xmath318 kev and @xmath319 ev for the higher energy one ( here we vary the emissivity index within @xmath320 and obtain the best fit value of @xmath321 ) .",
    "these line energies are consistent with the k@xmath72 line from h - like oxygen ions and l - lines from ionized iron ions .",
    "the photons to illuminate the disk would be produced from the comptonizing corona , or from the disk itself , whose emission could be partially incident on the disk because of gravitational light bending .",
    "if these photons could strongly illuminate the disk , huge emission lines might arise through a temperature inversion region of the irradiated disk atmosphere .",
    "the large equivalent width of the emission lines with respect to the continuum emission would be expected for a very high inclination source because of a large optical depth of the disk atmosphere .",
    "however , we have no model to accurately evaluate these effects at present .",
    "radiative transfer calculation including all these possible effects is left for future studies .",
    "we find that not only the _",
    "swift_/xrt spectrum in the high / soft state but also the _ suzaku _ spectrum in the low / hard state exhibit ionized absorption features .",
    "blue shifts are not significantly detected with upper limits of 23005800 km s@xmath16 .",
    "the absorber of the _ suzaku _ non - dip spectrum has a column density of @xmath322 @xmath19 and an ionization parameter of @xmath323 , while the _",
    "swift_/xrt spectrum requires two ionized absorbers with different parameters , @xmath324 @xmath19 and @xmath184 for one , @xmath325 @xmath19 and @xmath186 for the other . as discussed in section 5.2 , the dip spectra of _ suzaku _ are also described with ionized absorbers but with much larger column densities and lower ionization parameters , @xmath326 @xmath19 and @xmath327 for the deep dip , and @xmath328 @xmath19 and @xmath329 for the shallow dip .",
    "to investigate the origin of the ionized absorbers , we estimate their distances from the x - ray source ( @xmath83 ) from the definition of the ionization parameter , @xmath330 where @xmath331 and @xmath332 represent the hydrogen number - density and the length of the absorber , respectively . here",
    "@xmath81 is the incident luminosity , whose energy range is 11000 ry in the definition of xstar .",
    "@xmath81 is estimated as @xmath333 erg sec@xmath16 for the _ suzaku _ observation , and @xmath334 erg sec@xmath16 for the _ swift _ observation .",
    "assuming @xmath335 , we obtain @xmath336 km for the absorber seen in the _ suzaku _ non - dip spectrum . for the _ swift_/xrt data , we estimate @xmath337 km for the absorber with a higher ionization state and @xmath338 km for that with a lower ionization state .",
    "all these radii are more than an order of magnitude larger than predicted values for thermally driven disk winds in bhxbs ( @xmath339 km ; e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; also see below ) .",
    "furthermore , they are comparable to or even larger than the binary size ( see section 5.1 ) .",
    "hence , if the ionized absorbers of maxi  j1305@xmath15704 are located on the disk , @xmath340 should be much less than 1 .",
    "this suggests that the absorbers are originated from rather compact structures and do not largely extend in the radial direction .",
    "the absorbers in the deep and shallow dips are calculated to be @xmath341 km , and @xmath342 km , respectively , which are comparable to those seen in the _ suzaku _ and _ swift_/xrt non - dip spectra .",
    "table  [ tab_wind ] summarizes the physical properties of ionized absorbers reported in previous studies of black hole or neutron star x - ray binaries .",
    "the ionization parameter , column density , doppler velocity , and luminosity taken from the literature are listed .",
    "we then calculate the apparent distance @xmath83 by assuming @xmath335 for each set of parameters .",
    "although there is considerable variety in each parameter , almost all of the absorbers in the bhxbs are found to be outflowing with a velocity of 1001000 km sec@xmath16 .",
    "typically , they are located at @xmath343@xmath344 km when @xmath345 is assumed .",
    "they are interpreted as thermally ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , radiatively @xcite , or magnetically driven disk winds @xcite .",
    "by contrast , ionized absorbers in neutron star low mass x - ray binaries do not often exhibit significant blue shifts , except for some sources like gx 13 + 1 @xcite and cir x-1 @xcite , which are known to have powerful outflows .",
    "this implies that the photoionized plasma on neutron star dippers remain gravitationally bound to the system as disk atmosphere and is not outflowing due to a small system size and a low luminosity of the central x - ray source ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    from the comparison , we find that maxi  j1305@xmath15704 has somewhat lower ionization parameters ( @xmath346 ) and consequently larger @xmath83 than those of typical disk winds observed in other bhxbs . by contrast",
    ", absorbers in neutron star dippers sometimes have similar @xmath83 values ( see the table of xb 1916@xmath15053 and exo 0748@xmath15676 ) and exhibit complex and deep dips like maxi j1305@xmath15704 .",
    "although the bhxb gro  j1655@xmath1540 shows a similar value of @xmath83 ( @xmath347 km and @xmath348 km ) based on the results by @xcite , the turbulent velocity ( @xmath349 ) adopted there is much higher than that assumed for maxi  j1305@xmath15704 in our paper .",
    "we have to note that a larger @xmath349 value gives a smaller column density ; in the case of 4u 1630@xmath1547 , about 10 times larger values of @xmath17 was obtained with @xmath350 km sec@xmath16 than that with @xmath351 km sec@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "if we assumed @xmath352 km sec@xmath16 , the @xmath83 values of the maxi j1305@xmath15704 would become much larger than those of gro j1655@xmath1540 .",
    "the bhxb grs  1915@xmath268105 also shows a large apparent distance ( @xmath353 km ) , but its binary size is very large ( @xmath354 km ) as the source has a very long ( @xmath355 days ; @xcite ) orbital period and contains a massive black hole ( @xmath356 ) .",
    "thus , the distance of the ionized absorber in grs 1915@xmath268105 would be well within the size of accretion disk , even if @xmath357 is assumed .",
    "figure  [ fig_xsabs ] plots the values of @xmath17 and @xmath83 for the ionized absorbers in maxi j1305@xmath15704 and those in other bhxbs that exhibit dips and have turbulent velocities less than 1000 km sec@xmath16 , except for grs 1915@xmath268105 .",
    "the absorbers in maxi j1305@xmath15704 have large @xmath83 values and comparable or smaller @xmath17 values compared to those in the other sources .",
    "these properties suggest that the absorbers in maxi  j1305@xmath15704 are originated from compact structures like those responsible for the dips , rather than a typical disk wind , which would be widely extended in the radial direction ( i.e. , @xmath358 ) .",
    "the _ suzaku _",
    "light curve in the soft band exhibits significant time variability even in the non - dip phases on the shorter time scale than the orbital period .",
    "we find these small variabilities occur almost recurrently as well as the deep and shallow dips , by folding the suzaku light curve with the orbital period .",
    "this fact would support the idea that the ionized absorbers in maxi j1305@xmath15704 are associated with the disk and composed of compact clouds , unlike disk winds observed in other bhxbs that distribute quite homogeneously over the orbital phase @xcite . @xcite",
    "have recently obtained a very large number density ( @xmath359 @xmath241 ) from density - sensitive absorption lines seen in the high - resolution _",
    "chandra_/hetg spectrum of the source in the high / soft state and derived the actual distance of the absorber as @xmath360 km utilizing the density without any assumption of @xmath340 . from the distance and density , we can estimate the size of ionized absorber as @xmath361 km .",
    "this strongly indicates that the absorbers are composed of small clumps .",
    "a possibility is that a fraction of the absorbing gas responsible for the dips is spread to the non - dip phases .",
    "maxi  j1305@xmath15704 is likely to be a high inclination system even compared with other dipping bhxbs and we may see many complex structures of the absorbing gas with a small scale height on the surface of the accretion disk .",
    "as described in @xcite , the short orbital period of maxi j1305@xmath15704 may maintain the clumpy absorbers and produce the similarity in the properties of the ionized absorbers seen in neutron star binaries .",
    "also , like neutron star dippers , the disk size of maxi j1305@xmath15704 ( @xmath362 km ) , estimated from the binary size , is comparable with or maybe smaller than the compton radius ( @xmath363 @xmath364 @xmath365 km , where @xmath366 is the compton temperature in units of @xmath367 k ) and would not be sufficiently large to power a thermal - driven disk wind ( see * ? ? ?",
    "however , there remains a possibility that we are seeing the launching site of the disk wind near the outer edge of the disk , which may be less homogeneous than in its outer parts and can be compact ( @xmath368 ) . if this were the case , our _ suzaku _ result would imply that such a disk wind exists in the low / hard state of a bhxb and that the accretion states do not always determine the presence of disk winds .",
    "future studies using high quality and high resolution spectra , like those obtained by astro - h @xcite , should provide important clues to reveal the origin of these ionized absorbers in x - ray binaries .",
    "the _ suzaku _ , _ swift _ , and _ irsf _ observations of the newly discovered black hole candidate maxi  j1305@xmath15704 provide us with the following results :    1 .",
    "the source clearly shows two absorption dips with different mean hardness ratios .",
    "they have the same interval ( @xmath232 hours ) , which likely corresponds to the orbital period .",
    "the _ suzaku _ non - dip spectrum in the low / hard state can be described with a model composed of a multicolor disk emission , its comptonization , and a reflection component , absorbed by an ionized gas .",
    "the _ swift_/xrt spectrum in the high / soft state is well reproduced with a relativistic disk emission model with a moderate spin parameter ( @xmath369 ) for an assumed inclination angle of @xmath229 , a black hole mass of 3 @xmath226 , and a luminosity of @xmath165 . the inner disk radius obtained in the _",
    "swift_/xrt spectrum is much smaller than that in the _ suzaku _ spectrum , indicating that the inner edge of the standard disk was receded as the state transition from the high / soft state to the low / hard state .",
    "4 .   the ionized absorbers in the dip spectra of _ suzaku _ have smaller ionization parameters and larger hydrogen column densities than those of the non - dip spectrum .",
    "similar trends are observed from dipping neutron star x - ray binaries .",
    "we find that the ionized absorbers have much smaller ionized parameters and column densities than those of typical disk winds seen in other bhxbs .",
    "the properties of the absorbing gas are rather similar to the deeply - dipping neutron star x - ray binaries .",
    "these results suggest that the absorbers have compact and clumpy structures like those responsible for the dips rather than a homogeneous disk wind .",
    "the possibility that we are seeing the launching site of a disk wind is not ruled out , however .",
    "6 .   near infrared observations in the @xmath162 , @xmath191 , and @xmath192 bands",
    "were also performed with _",
    "irsf _ both in the high / soft state and low / hard state .",
    "the fluxes in the three bands are about an order of magnitude larger than the disk emission estimated from the x - ray spectra and can be described with the reprocessed thermal emission from the irradiated outer disk and the black body emission from the companion star .",

    "<S> we report the results from x - ray studies of the newly discovered black hole candidate maxi j1305 - 704 based on _ suzaku _ and _ swift _ observations in the low / hard and high / soft states , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the long _ suzaku _ observation shows two types of clear absorption dips , both of which recur on a dip interval of @xmath0 hours , which we identify with the orbital period . </S>",
    "<S> there is also partially ionized absorption in the non - dip ( persistent ) emission in both the high / soft state and , very unusually , the low / hard state . </S>",
    "<S> however , this absorption ( in both states ) has substantially lower ionization than that seen in other high inclination systems , where the material forms a homogeneous disk wind . here instead the absorption is most probably associated with clumpy , compact structures associated with the dipping material , which we see uniquely in this source likely because we view it at a very large inclination angle . </S>",
    "<S> a large inclination angle is also favored , together with a low black hole mass , to explain the high disk temperature seen in the fairly low luminosity high / soft state , as doppler boosting enhances the disk temperature at high inclination . </S>",
    "<S> the disk radius inferred from these data is significantly smaller than that of the soft component seen in the low / hard state , supporting models where the disk is truncated at low luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> we find , however , that the lack of variability power on time scales of @xmath1  sec in the _ suzaku _ low / hard state data is difficult to explain , even with a low mass black hole . </S>"
