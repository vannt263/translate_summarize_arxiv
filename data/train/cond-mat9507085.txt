    "the question of the order parameter symmetry is one of the central issues of high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "there is a general consensus that the superconducting gap is highly anisotropic , but whether the gap has a particular symmetry under rotations is still a matter of debate .",
    "a number of experiments on ybco-123 are roughly consistent with the @xmath4wave symmetry @xcite for which the most natural source is the exchange of magnetic fluctuations  @xcite , but some experiments , e.g. , photoemission studies on bscco-2212 @xcite as well as @xmath5-axis josephson tunneling experiments on ybco@xcite , are inconsistent with the pure d - wave , but more consistent with an @xmath6 state . in principle , the presence of orthorhombic distortion in , e.  g.  , bscco-2212 @xcite in itself guarantees that an otherwise @xmath1-wave superconducting gap will have an admixture of the @xmath0-wave @xcite .",
    "however , the superconducting state may be a mixture of @xmath0 and @xmath1 components even in the absence of an orthorhombic distortion .",
    "a superconducting state with a mixed @xmath7 symmetry of the gap was first discussed in @xcite , and the @xmath2 state in @xcite .",
    "the mixed symmetry state at intermediate doping levels was also found in variational monte carlo studies of the @xmath8 model@xcite .",
    "an alternative possibility of symmetry mixing due to interplane coupling was proposed in ref .",
    "more exotic mixed symmetry states have also been suggested @xcite .",
    "very recent work has shown @xcite that the extent of s - wave admixture is a strong function of @xmath9 , the second neighbor hopping , which varies a good deal from one high - t@xmath10 material to another .",
    "this strongly suggests that the question of s - d mixing should be looked at as a function of hole doping , and that this must be done in each high - t@xmath10 material separately .",
    "the variational monte carlo calculations indicate that at the doping levels which favor mixed symmetry states , the ground state energy is roughly independent of the relative phase @xmath11 of s- and d - wave components .",
    "this relative phase is of great importance , since only @xmath12 and @xmath13 states can have gap nodes .",
    "the experiments on combinations of josephson junctions on ybco-123 @xcite appear to rule out a relative phase of @xmath14 if the s - wave amplitude is more than about 10% of the d - wave .",
    "recent photoemission work as a function of hole doping @xcite , @xcite indicates that @xmath15 and that the relative amplitude of s - wave and d - wave depends on temperature and hole doping level .    in view of both the experimental situation , which appears to indicate that s - d mixing is possible in some systems and the theoretical situation where the relative phase is not well - determined , additional understanding of the physics of this phase",
    "is needed . in this paper",
    ", we address the issue whether one can obtain the @xmath3 mixed state in calculations on a simple but fairly general model .",
    "the answer we obtain is negative - we found that for any coupling , the only possible mixed symmetry in this model is @xmath16 .",
    "we consider a model of an isotropic two dimensional fermi liquid with attractive interaction in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 channels .",
    "we assume that both interactions are frequency - independent in a frequency range bounded by the cut - off frequency @xmath17 , and are zero for @xmath18 .",
    "obviously , when only one of the two interaction channels is present , the ground state is described by the corresponding pure symmetry gap function . when both interaction channels are present , their competition will lead to either one of the two pure symmetry superconducting states , or a mixed state , where the gap function contains both the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 harmonics .    in the next section we will consider the weak coupling case , where one can use the bcs formalism .",
    "we will show that the transition between @xmath0 and @xmath1 symmetries occurs via an intermediate phase with mixed @xmath19 symmetry .",
    "the two phase transitions between the pure and the mixed states are second order . in section",
    "iii we consider the case of arbitrary coupling in the framework of the eliashberg theory .",
    "we will show that there always exists a range of relative strengths of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 interactions where an @xmath2 solution exists .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath3 mixed state is more complicated .",
    "however , we can show that at least in both the weak and the strong coupling limits the @xmath3 mixed state does not occur .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section iv . as an aside , in the appendix we also present few simple results for the thermodynamics of a @xmath1-wave superconductor in the weak coupling limit , which to the best of our knowledge have not been published anywhere else .",
    "the main feature is that the ratio of the superconducting gap to the transition temperature , @xmath20 , for @xmath1-wave is 4.28 , larger than 3.06 for the @xmath0-wave .",
    "in this section we will consider the case when the coupling is weak in both interaction channels . in this case",
    "the bcs theory is valid , and the gap equation assumes the following form @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 ^ 2 + |\\delta(\\vec{k})|^2 } = \\sqrt{\\varepsilon_{\\vec{k}}^2 + |\\delta(\\vec{k})|^2 } \\label{two}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath23 is the interaction , which contains both @xmath0 and @xmath1 harmonics . the angle @xmath24 is defined in our two - dimensional model as @xmath25 .",
    "consider now a trial mixed state with arbitrary phase difference between the s - wave and the d - wave components of the order parameter : @xmath26 separating the real and imaginary parts of this equation , and also @xmath0 and @xmath1 components , we obtain a set of three independent equations @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that if both @xmath29 and @xmath30 are finite , the set ( [ delta_s ] - [ cossin ] ) can be simultaneously satisfied in only two cases @xmath12 or @xmath31 , leading to @xmath3 or @xmath2 respectively .",
    "thus the weak - coupling theory gives the same restricted set of possibilities for the internal phase angle that ginzburg - landau theory offers  @xcite .",
    "below we consider these two cases separately",
    ".      in this case @xmath15 , and equations ( [ delta_s ] ) and ( [ delta_d ] ) become : @xmath32 performing the integration over frequency and doing standard manipulations , we obtain @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and the function @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 the graphical solution of eq.([alpha ] ) is shown in fig .  [ fig_fal ] .",
    "it is easy to see that in the limit of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , while in the limit of @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "if we start out with @xmath43 , then , naturally , the only solution is @xmath44 , i.e. pure @xmath1-wave . as @xmath45 increases , the slope of the straight line on fig .  [ fig_fal ] decreases , and at @xmath46 the lines first cross at @xmath47 .",
    "if we increase @xmath45 even further , we find three solutions : at @xmath48 , and at some finite @xmath49 , which corresponds to a mixed state .",
    "as @xmath45 increases further , @xmath49 decreases and becomes zero at @xmath50 for larger @xmath45 , there exists only one solution : @xmath47 which corresponds to a pure @xmath0-wave state .",
    "we see therefore that @xmath4wave solution exists at @xmath51 while the @xmath52wave solution exists at @xmath53 .",
    "the key point is that @xmath54 , such that there is an intermediate region @xmath55 where both pure solutions exist together with the @xmath6 solution . to verify which solutions are stable , we computed the second derivatives of the energy and found that the two pure solutions are stable in the intermediate region while the @xmath6 state actually corresponds to a maximum rather than a minimum of energy .",
    "clearly then , @xmath6 state is unstable ; if it was the only mixed state allowed , then the system would simply undergo a first - order transition between the two pure states with a region where hysteresis is possible between @xmath56 and @xmath57 .      in the case of @xmath58",
    ", we follow the same procedure . now the coupled gap equations have the following form @xmath59 integrating over frequency and doing standard manipulations we obtain that the mixed state exists if @xmath60 as before , @xmath61 .",
    "as we start out with @xmath43 , eq .  ( [ alpha : sid ] ) has no solution and the gap has pure @xmath1 symmetry @xmath62 ) .",
    "however , contrary to the previous case , here a solution of ( [ alpha : sid ] ) first appears at @xmath63 for the same @xmath44 .",
    "as we increase @xmath45 from @xmath64 , @xmath65 and therefore @xmath29 increases continuously , satisfying @xmath66 and becomes infinite at @xmath67 .",
    "clearly , in this situation , we have a second order phase transition from pure @xmath1 to a mixed @xmath2 symmetry state at @xmath68 , and a second order transition from a mixed state to pure @xmath0 state at @xmath69 .",
    "in other words , the two pure states , which are stable with respect to @xmath6 mixture , are in fact unstable ( for corresponding @xmath45 ) with respect to @xmath19 mixture , and in between @xmath64 and @xmath70 , the @xmath19 state is the equilibrium state of a system ( see fig.[fig_phase ] ) .",
    "in order to be certain that our results are not an artifact of the weak - coupling approximation , we perform the calculations in the strong coupling regime .",
    "we follow the eliashberg formalism @xcite at zero temperature .",
    "we assume that the frequency cutoff @xmath71 , so that vertex corrections can be neglected according to migdal theorem @xcite .",
    "in the eliashberg approach , one preserves the frequency dependence of the gap , and substitutes the full quasiparticle green function in the gap equation . in explicit form ,",
    "the equations are @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the renormalized single particle energy , @xmath74 is the anomalous part of the self - energy , and @xmath75 is the antisymmetric in @xmath76 part of the normal self - energy . as @xmath71 , the integration over @xmath77 is confined to a region near the fermi surface and can be substituted by the integration over @xmath78 , as in bcs theory .",
    "this integration is straightforward , and yields @xmath79 we now again consider the two mixed states separately .",
    "consider first a mixed @xmath2 state .",
    "for this symmetry , the angular decomposition of the self - energy functions yields @xmath80 accordingly , eqs.([eliash2 ] ) can be decomposed into four equations @xmath81 equation ( [ omega_d ] ) is homogeneous in @xmath82 . for weak coupling",
    "its only solution was @xmath83 . in principle , at strong coupling , there is a chance that above some threshold , there exists a solution with a non - zero @xmath82 .",
    "we will not consider this rather exotic possibility and assume that the stable solution of eq.([omega_d ] ) corresponds to @xmath84 for all couplings .",
    "we now follow the same approach as at weak coupling and look for the transition points between pure @xmath0 and mixed @xmath2 , and pure @xmath1 and mixed @xmath2 states . in the former case ,",
    "we linearize the above set of equations around @xmath85 and obtain @xmath86 eqs.([s_to_m ] ) are obviously satisfied when @xmath67 , the same as for weak coupling .",
    "now consider the transition from the @xmath1-wave state into the mixed state .",
    "linearizing eqs.([delta_d2])-([omega_s ] ) with respect to @xmath87 we get @xmath88    we first observe that if the second term in eq .",
    "( [ d_to_md ] ) were absent , the @xmath4 wave solution would become unstable at @xmath89 .",
    "we now show that this second term yields a negative correction to the first term independent of what @xmath90 and @xmath91 are .",
    "indeed , let s perform angular integration first .",
    "for the first term in ( [ d_to_md ] ) , the integrand ( apart from @xmath92 ) is positive , and the integration yields a positive result . for the second term , we have to evaluate @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "doing simple manipulations , we obtain @xmath95 since @xmath96 is positive when @xmath97 , then @xmath98 is negative .",
    "this simple argument shows that the second term in ( [ d_to_md ] ) effectively reduces the value of @xmath99 to @xmath100 . clearly then",
    ", the critical value @xmath101 for the transition between the pure @xmath1 state and the @xmath102 mixed state will be _ smaller _ than @xmath103 .",
    "the above consideration shows that for arbitrary interaction strength , exists a range of @xmath104 where neither of the pure states is stable .",
    "we further expanded near each of the transition points up to qubic terms in either @xmath29 or @xmath30 , and indeed found a nonzero solution for this intermediate range of couplings which implies that in the intermediate region , the gap has an @xmath19 symmetry .",
    "it turns out therefore that the phase diagram at weak and strong couplings is essentially the same .",
    "it is nevertheless interesting that the strong coupling corrections tend make the mixing of s - wave into a predominantly d - wave more favorable .",
    "now we study whether it is possible to obtain the @xmath3 mixed symmetry state in equilibrium .",
    "this case is significantly more complicated , because unlike the @xmath2 case , the square of the gap function now contains a term which is linear in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 components .",
    "however , we will show that at least in the limit of very strong coupling , there is no region of @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "indeed , consider the transition between the pure @xmath0 and the mixed @xmath3 states .",
    "eliashberg equations linearized in @xmath105 and @xmath82 read @xmath106 we now show that for @xmath107 and @xmath108 , @xmath109",
    ". indeed , suppose that this is true .",
    "then it is easy to see that in the region of frequencies we are interested in , @xmath110 is frequency independent and equal to @xmath111 , while @xmath112 is linear in @xmath76 . letting @xmath113 , we can rewrite the inequality as @xmath114 . then",
    ", equation ( [ s_to_mos ] ) becomes @xmath115 solving ( [ lambda1 ] ) we obtain for @xmath107 @xmath116 thus justifying the assumption that @xmath117 .",
    "furthermore , in this limit , eq.([s_to_md ] ) reduces to @xmath118 using ( [ lambda2 ] ) we finally obtain that @xmath119 we see therefore that in the strong coupling limit , the hypothetical transition between a mixed @xmath3 and a pure @xmath0 states occurs at @xmath120 .",
    "however , for this ratio of couplings , both the pure @xmath0-wave and the mixed state clearly must be unstable with respect to the pure @xmath1-wave state .",
    "a similar analysis shows that the transition between the pure @xmath0 and the mixed state occurs at @xmath121 . as a result",
    ", we again have @xmath122 , which , just as in the weak coupling case , implies that there is no region of mixed @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "we have studied in this paper a two - dimensional isotropic fermi liquid with attractive interaction in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 channels .",
    "we considered the weak coupling limit and also applied the eliashberg formalism at strong coupling .",
    "the phase diagram of the superconductor turns out to be the same at weak and strong coupling .",
    "it displays a region with a mixed @xmath2 symmetry gap when the coupling strengths in the two channels are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the phase transitions between the mixed state and the pure @xmath0 and @xmath1 states are second order .",
    "we have shown that in the weak and in the strong coupling limits a mixed @xmath3 state does not occur .",
    "intuitively , this can be interpreted as the propensity of the system to choose the state in which the amplitude of the gap function has the largest value .",
    "this is also in agreement with the ginsburg - landau considerations @xcite , which suggest that in the absence of orthorhombic distortion , the @xmath2 state has lower energy than the @xmath3 state .",
    "indeed , the model we considered is oversimplified : the two - dimensional isotropic fermi liquid captures some of features of the high - t@xmath5 materials , however , the isotropic system is never close to a magnetic or a metal - insulator transition .",
    "our analysis of the @xmath3 versus @xmath2 question therefore does not include such effects . in this sense , what we have shown here is that if the @xmath3 state is realized in real materials , some nontrivial physical effect of the proximity to these phase transitions is likely to be the cause .",
    "this work was supported by the nsf materials research group program under grant no .",
    "dmr-9214707 and by grant no .",
    "in this appendix , we present weak coupling calculations for the thermodynamics of a pure @xmath1-wave superconductor .    the gap equation at zero temperature is @xmath123 after simple manipulations we arrive at @xmath124 at the same time , the transition temperature is given by  @xcite @xmath125 where @xmath126 is euler s constant .",
    "then @xmath127 note , this ratio for @xmath0-wave is 3.06 .    finally , starting with the gap equation at finite temperature @xmath128 and performing standard expansions at @xmath129 and @xmath130  @xcite we find the following expressions for the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap @xmath131 { } ~~~~ & t",
