    "the origin of carbonaceous grains observed in the interstellar medium and in the early solar system is a topic of great interest .",
    "these grains are composed of a chain or a network of carbon atoms , bonded to hydrogen atoms at their periphery with physical and chemical properties intermediate between those of simple molecules and of bulk solid particles . due to the versatility of carbon atoms in creating various hybridized bonds",
    ", these carbonaceous grains can have very complex chemical structures @xcite .",
    "recent infrared spectroscopic observations from space have revealed that carbon - rich post - asymptotic giant branch ( post - agb ) stars undergo rapid synthesis of hydrocarbon grains with both aromatic and aliphatic signatures .",
    "the `` aromatic '' hydrocarbon is characterized by benzene - like rings in which carbon atoms are connected to each other with conjugated double bonds , while the `` aliphatic '' hydrocarbon consists of linear chains or a network of carbon atoms connected by saturated bonds .",
    "the production and ejection of these grains may play a significant role in the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium and the early solar system @xcite . specifically , while carbon - rich agb stars show either the 11.3 @xmath0 m feature due to sic or a featureless continuum due to amorphous carbon @xcite , aromatic features at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , and 11.3 @xmath0 m and aliphatic features at 3.4 and 6.9  @xmath0 m begin to appear in proto - planetary nebulae ( ppn , kwok , volk , & hrivnak 1999 ) .",
    "we now know that the aliphatic to aromatic transformation of the circumstellar dust from ppn to planetary nebulae coincides with environmental changes of increasing stellar temperature , less protective dusty environment , and the outbreak of harsh uv radiation @xcite . in order to test any photochemical models ,",
    "we first need a good knowledge of the spatial distribution of the emitting materials .",
    "the observations of these objects in the short transition phase between agb stars and planetary nebulae are therefore of primary importance in our understanding of the chemical synthesis of carbonaceous grains .    iras 04296 + 3429 along with iras 05341 + 0852 and",
    "iras 22272 + 5435 belong to a small group of ppns with extreme carbon - rich chemistry , first recognized by the presence of an unidentified 21  @xmath0 m emission feature in their iras / lrs spectra @xcite .",
    "the observational properties of these sources , taken from the literature , are summarized in table  [ tb1 ] .",
    "this class of ppn is most exclusively characterized by prominent emission features of highly aliphatic material with broad emission at 3.4  @xmath0 m alongside the common aromatic feature at 3.3  @xmath0 m first detected by @xcite and @xcite , subsequently classified in @xcite . since the hydrocarbon dust is synthesized in the circumstellar environment , if it undergoes temporal modification it will leave a record of unique spatial distribution in the circumstellar envelope . with sufficient spatial resolution , we may observe the history of dust formation as a change of hydrocarbon dust structure with distance from the central star .",
    "such observations provide a critical test for the proposed evolutionary schemes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , ppns are usually small in angular extent and require sub - arcsecond resolution to image .",
    "it is only recently that the imaging resolution in the infrared has become good enough to perform such experiments @xcite . in this paper , we present high - angular resolution imaging spectroscopy of the distribution of circumstellar hydrocarbon dust using an adaptive optics ( ao ) system .",
    "the 3  @xmath0 m spectra of iras 04296 + 3429 and iras 05341 + 0852 were obtained at the subaru telescope atop mauna kea on 2001 december 23 with the infrared camera and spectrograph ( ircs ; tokunaga et al .",
    "1998 ; kobayashi et al .",
    "an adaptive optics system was used as a front - end instrument to feed wavefront - compensated images to ircs .",
    "the subaru ao is a 36-element curvature - based system installed at the telescope cassegrain port @xcite .",
    "it delivers diffraction - limited images at wavelengths longer than 2  @xmath0 m .",
    "a medium - resolution grism was used with a 030 slit to provide spectra with a resolving power of @xmath1 600800 .",
    "the plate scale of the spectrograph was 58  mas / pixel along the slit .",
    "the slit was aligned to pa @xmath2 28  and 98  for iras 04296 + 3429 , along the disk and the bipolar lobe projected on the sky @xcite .",
    "the slit was rotated to pa @xmath2 45  for iras 05341 + 0852 which is along the elongation of the nebula at optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the visible central stars of iras 04296 + 3429 ( 1200 - 02336188 in the usno a-2.0 catalogue ; @xmath3 13.7  mag ) and iras 05341 + 0852 ( 0975 - 01778353 ; @xmath3 12.7  mag ) were used as the wavefront references for the ao system .",
    "the spectrograms were recorded by wobbling the ao system s tip - tilt mirror by @xmath415 along the slit .",
    "a g0.5v star hr  660 ( @xmath3 4.5  mag ) was observed at the beginning of the observation through similar airmass to calibrate for atmospheric transmission .",
    "the mismatch in airmass between this reference and the observed objects was smaller than 0.1 . in order to use hr  660 as the standard star for the point - spread function ( psf ) as well ,",
    "hr  660 was dimmed by neutral density filters in front of the wavefront sensor until the output counts of the avalanche photodiodes were comparable to that of the objects , so that the corrected wavefront error would be similar .",
    "the observation of iras 04296 + 3429 was completed within 1.3 hrs of observing hr  660 for the first slit position at pa@xmath298 .",
    "hr  660 may not be as good a psf standard for iras 05341 + 0852 as this was observed nearly 4 hours later .",
    "the psf as measured with hr  660 provides an independent measurement to test the spatial extent of iras 04296 + 3429 , as discussed in  3.1 .",
    "the spectroscopic flat field was made at the end of the night using a halogen lamp installed at the calibration unit in front of the instrument entrance window .",
    "the seeing was good at the beginning of the night ( 055 at @xmath5 ) , deteriorating towards the end of the observation ( 086 at @xmath5 ) .",
    "the details of the observation of iras 22272 + 5435 are presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "data reduction begins with correcting each frame for detector non - linearity , since even a slight saturation of the detector response affects the psf measurement so crucial to the present study .",
    "suppression of pixel counts at the peak of the psf modifies the spatial profile by slightly flattening it .",
    "therefore , the measured spatial width is increased .",
    "special care must be taken to account for the pixel counts in the pedestal readout . a typical readout of an infrared detector array consists of three steps : a reset of the entire array , after which integration starts immediately ; a first readout to sample the pixel counts at the beginning of the exposure ; and a second readout after the desired integration time .",
    "then the pedestal count from the first readout is subtracted , yielding the net signal .",
    "this net signal is usually monitored during observations not to exceed the detector linearity limit .",
    "however , for observations in high - flux regime such as the ones done with the ao system , the integration time can be so short that it is comparable to the detector readout time .",
    "substantial photon flux is already accumulated in the pixel before the first readout .",
    "the pedestal counts can potentially push the second readout up into the non - linear regime , a situation which can not be recognized when only the net signal is monitored .",
    "the pedestal count depends on how soon the relevant pixel is read after the array reset , and therefore depends on the location of the pixel in the array .",
    "the magnitude of the non - linearity correction , including the position - dependent pedestal count , amounts to not more than 8% in most of the observations with our setup using a pixel readout of 0.41  s for the entire array , an integration time of 8  s , and with maximum net counts restricted to values below 5,000  adu .",
    "following the above described non - linearity correction , consecutive spectrograms were subtracted from each other to eliminate background sky emission .",
    "pixel - to - pixel detector response variation was normalized by ratioing with dark - subtracted flat - field images .",
    "the extraction aperture was defined at a fixed distance from the profile centroid , and the enclosed pixel counts were summed up to produce a one - dimensional spectrum .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed by maximizing the correlation of resulting spectrum with a model atmospheric transmission curve computed by atran @xcite .",
    "telluric atmospheric absorption features were removed by dividing by the spectrum of the spectroscopic standard star hr  660 .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ f1 ] for iras 04296 + 3429 and iras 05341 + 0852 , after normalization by a polynomial function fitted to the continuum emission in order to highlight the hydrocarbon emission features at 3.23.6  @xmath0 m .",
    "the spectrum of iras 22272 + 5435 extracted from the off - center region of the nebula , originally published in @xcite , is shown for comparison .",
    "two parallel trends are noticeable .",
    "first , the aliphatic emission feature at 3.4  @xmath0 m , specific to this class of carbon - rich ppns , diminishes as one progresses from iras 05341 + 0852 to iras 04296 + 3429 and to iras 22272 + 5435 , with respect to the aromatic emission at 3.3  @xmath0 m . at the same time",
    ", the overall intensity of hydrocarbon emission above the continuum decreases .",
    "large - scale ( @xmath6 05 ) variations of the spectral shape of the emission feature were checked for iras 04296 + 5435 and iras 05341 + 0852 in the same way as was done for iras 22272 + 5435 , by shifting the extraction aperture from the central star @xcite .",
    "the flux at the off - center regions is dominated by the psf halo of the central star , and no significant difference was observed between the spectra extracted at the central stars and those taken from the off - center regions .",
    "adaptive optics provides superb spatial resolution for imaging and spectroscopy .",
    "however , this resolution is highly variable when operating at the system s performance limit , reflecting the variability of observing conditions .",
    "the reference psf varies according to the seeing , the brightness of the wavefront reference source , and the observing wavelength ( therefore the color of each object ) .",
    "this variable psf makes the interpretation of the spatial extent of observed sources a challenge .",
    "for instance , if a stellar image is larger than a known unresolved reference observed previoulsy , there is no way to tell whether that source has indeed a circumstellar structure , or if the seeing has simply become worse .",
    "this uncertainty can be eliminated if a point source reference is observed at the same time with the same instrumental setup , and preferably in the same frame .",
    "this is often difficult to achieve .",
    "we used spectroscopy as a means of sampling a reference psf within frames .",
    "spectroscopy amounts to simultaneous imaging at multiple wavelengths over hundreds of spectral elements , though spatially one dimensional .",
    "if certain spectral features are spatially extended , this is most sensitively detected by differentiating the spatial profile from that of the immediate continuum region .",
    "the scheme is illustrated in figure [ f2 ] . in the present observations ,",
    "we have compared the cross section of the spectrogram at the hydrocarbon dust emission wavelength with the nearby continuum .",
    "the spatial profile of iras 04296 + 3429 in figure 2 is wider at the level of the emission feature by approximately 16% , compared to the continuum wavelength .",
    "this difference in the widths of the two spectral regions is not large , but it is real , otherwise the spatial profiles at these two spectral regions would be identical , as it is the case for the comparison star hr  660 shown in the same figure .",
    "since spatial profiles are sparsely sampled in pixelized data , the pixel data must be interpolated in order to quantitatively parametrize the spatial profile . empirically",
    ", we found that the observed psf is better approximated by a lorentzian than by a single component gaussian , given the high wings resulting from of the first ring and the seeing halo around the diffraction core ( fig .",
    "the bad pixels with outlying responses were deliberately left uncorrected , because smoothing outlier pixels modifies the intrinsic spatial profile , leading to an incorrect spatial width .",
    "the full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the spatial profiles was derived from these fits , and was measured at each spectral element from 2.9 to 4.1  @xmath0 m . the `` fwhm spectrum '' , the variation of fwhm as a function of the wavelength ,",
    "was measured separately in each frame to preserve spatial resolution .",
    "they were then combined together for each source .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ f3 ] .",
    "the spatial width of iras 04296 + 3429 is clearly extended near the 3.33.4  @xmath0 m hydrocarbon emission features , compared to its size at continuum wavelengths .",
    "the spectroscopic data for iras 22272 + 5435 , obtained by @xcite , were reprocessed in the same manner as described here , and the resulting fwhm spectrum is shown in figures [ f3 ] for comparison with iras 04296 + 3429 and iras 05341 + 0852 .",
    "the spatial width we measured in  3.3 is a stellar angular diameter convolved with the system psf . in order to derive the intrinsic dimension of the emitting region",
    ", we need to deconvolve the psf from the apparent spatial width . for this task , we assume the observed spatial width is a simple squared sum of the intrinsic angular size and the size of the psf at that wavelength , @xmath7 obtaining the correct psf , @xmath8 , is not a trivial task , since the wavelength - dependent psf changes with ao performance at the time of observing .",
    "we calculate the intrinsic physical dimension @xmath9 in two ways , assuming different @xmath8 at deconvolution .",
    "first , we assume the continuum emission of iras 04296 + 3429 is an unresolved point source .",
    "we measure only the _ relative _ dimension of the hydrocarbon emitting region with respect to the continuum dust emission .",
    "the apparent diameter of iras 04296 + 3429 smoothly increases at longer wavelengths except near the hydrocarbon emission features and at the spikes of heavy absorption by methane in the telluric atmosphere at 3.23.4  @xmath0 m .",
    "a polynomial function is fit to the continuum of the fwhm spectrum , and is taken as @xmath10 ( fig .",
    "the large @xmath8 assumed here provides a stringent lower limit for the extent of the hydrocarbon emitting zone .",
    "the apparent angular diameter of the continuum emitting region is 180  mas at 3.4  at pa=98@xmath11 , as is shown by the fit in figure  [ f3 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the apparent fwhm is well above 200  mas at the hydrocarbon emission features , yielding a minimum physical diameter for the hydrocarbon emitting region of @xmath12100  mas ( fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) , corresponding to 400  au in diameter assuming a distance of 4  kpc for iras 04296 + 3429 @xcite .    in an alternative approach",
    ", we assume the system psf was stable throughout the observations and simply use the apparent diameter of hr  660 as @xmath8 to deconvolve the fwhm of iras 04296 + 3429 .",
    "this assumption allows an _ absolute _ estimate of the actual physical dimension of iras 04296 + 3429 .",
    "the deconvolved fwhm of iras 04296 + 3429 by this method is 160  mas at 3.4  @xmath0 m .",
    "the corresponding physical dimension of the hydrocarbon core is 640  au ( pa @xmath2 98 ) in diameter ( fig .  [ f4 ] ) .",
    "iras 04296 + 3429 is apparently larger than hr  660 at all the wavelengths observed in the present study ( fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) , which may suggest that even the continuum emission is indeed extended and not a point source as we assumed in the first method .",
    "however , it is not clear which method described above is better suited to this particular case , as the dust emission tops the stellar component exactly at the relevant wavelengths near 34  @xmath0 m @xcite , which implies the continuum emission is still dominated by the stellar point source ; although there could be a substantial contribution to the continuum emission in the 3  @xmath0 m region from very small , stochastically heated grains .",
    "from _ hst _ optical imaging , we know that iras 04296 + 3429 consists of three major components : a large spherical halo ; a disk seen in the scattered light ; and a bipolar lobe nearly vertical to the disk , plunging into the surrounding halo @xcite .",
    "the halo is the remnant of the circumstellar material ejected during the previous asymptotic giant branch phase .",
    "the bipolar lobe , delineated by its interface to the halo , is supposed to be collimated by the disk .",
    "this geometry is typical of ppns and we assume that they were formed in the order of the halo , the disk , and the bipolar lobes .",
    "the newly found hydrocarbon emitting region is much smaller in size than all of the above three components , and does not correspond to any of the structures previously imaged in visible light .",
    "the double - peaked spectral energy distribution observed in this object suggests that the dust shell is detached from the central star and large - scale mass loss has ceased some time in the past @xcite .",
    "however , the compact hydrocarbon - dust emitting region found in this paper implies that carbon - dust formation is still in progress in iras 04296 + 3429 .",
    "this provides a direct proof that aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon dust are being made in the circumstellar environment during the post - agb phase .",
    "since the distribution of the hydrocarbon dust emission has been measured in three ppns , we can use these results to determine their evolutionary status within the post - agb evolution sequence .",
    "the wider fwhm compared to the continuum emission region is interpreted as the hydrocarbon dust being spatially extended .",
    "its total luminosity is at least comparable to that of the continuum emission . the hydrocarbon dust around iras 22272 + 5435 is distributed between 700 and 1500  au from the central star @xcite",
    "this is twice larger than the hydrocarbon - dust core in iras 04296 + 3429 .",
    "we applied the same analysis to iras 22272 + 5435 as to iras 04296 + 3429 to see if there is any extended but compact emission core in the central region of the nebula ( fig .",
    "we found no excess of the fwhm at the central star , although iras 22272 + 5435 is closer to us ( @xmath13 1.8  kpc ; private communication , nakashima 2006 based on the formula presented in deguchi et al .",
    "2002 ) , typical for a ppn .",
    "the interstellar extinction is not accounted for , which may affect the visible part of the sed .",
    "this distance is therefore an upper limit , yielding an upper limit for the physical extent of the hydrocarbon emitting region at iras 22272 + 5435 . ] , indicating that the hydrocarbon dust in iras 22272 + 5435 has been cleared up and the central star is already seen through the dust envelope .",
    "no enhancement of the width of the spatial profile is observed at the hydrocarbon emission wavelength for iras 05341 + 0852 ( fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) . at first glance",
    ", the fwhm spectrum of iras 05341 + 0852 looks similar to that of iras 22272 + 5435 where the dust emitting region extends to as much as 15 in diameter .",
    "however , we demonstrate here that in fact the hydrocarbon emission in iras 05341 + 0852 is compact and unresolved . first , a crucial difference between the two sources is the lack of a diffuse hydrocarbon dust emission around iras 05341 + 0852 .",
    "we ruled out any possible spatial variation of the hydrocarbon emission feature in iras 05341 + 0852 using the same analysis as for iras 22272 + 5435 in @xcite .",
    "if positively detected , a spatial variation would have provided unambiguous evidence of a physically extended hydrocarbon dust emitting zone",
    ". however , not only was such a variation not detected , but even the intensity of the emission feature relative to the continuum level is constant regardless of the distance from the central star , which is consistent with a point source and favors the interpretation that the hydrocarbon emission in iras 05341 + 0852 is unresolved .",
    "second , we estimated the shape of dust emitting region of iras 05341 + 0852 , assuming a general morphology similar to that of iras 22272 + 5435 .",
    "the nebulosity around iras 22272 + 5435 spans 347@xmath14337 in _",
    "i_-band @xcite , and is smaller in the mid - infrared ( 13@xmath1410 at 8  @xmath0 m , averaged from meixner et al .",
    "1997 and ueta et al . 2001 ) .",
    "this is roughly the dimension of the detached hydrocarbon emitting zone located by @xcite .",
    "iras 05341 + 0852 appears much smaller in _ i_-band , presumably because it is further ( 114@xmath14078 , ueta et al .",
    "if we simply scale the near - infrared appearance of iras 05341 + 0852 in proportion to the dimension of iras 22272 + 5435 in _ i_-band and the mid - infrared , the hydrocarbon emitting region of iras 05341 + 0852 should measure 0204 from the central star .",
    "if iras 05341 + 0852 had a detached hydrocarbon emitting region comparable to that of iras 22272 + 5435 , it would have been spatially resolved by our observation , even when accouting for the increaded distance to iras 05341 + 0852 .",
    "here we try to place an upper limit on the physical extent of the hydrocarbon dust in iras 05341 + 0852 .",
    "the distance to the ppn is poorly known .",
    "we take a conservative value of @xmath15 7.4  kpc to iras 05341 + 0852 from @xcite , which assumes the typical intrinsic luminosity of ppns to be @xmath16 .",
    "the fwhm of iras 05341 + 0852 is averaged to 174.5@xmath48.5  mas in the range of 3.2 to 3.6  @xmath0 m .",
    "the uncertainty sets upper limit for the physical extent of hydrocarbon emitting zone to 54.2  mas after deconvolution , which translates to 400  au at the distance quoted above .",
    "therefore , if iras 05341 + 0852 has a dust - emission core with similar spatial extent as iras 04296 + 3429 ( @xmath12400  au ) , it should have been detected even at that distance , although admittedly only marginally . in order to be consistent ,",
    "if we use 7.1  kpc as the distance to iras 04296 + 3429 as proposed by the same authors using the same method , instead of the 4  kpc given by @xcite , the physical extent of the hydrocarbon emitting zone around iras 04296 + 3429 increases to @xmath17 1,100  au .",
    "this makes it even safer to say that the physical extent of iras 05341 + 0852 is less than that of iras 04296 + 3429 , and if the former had a hydrocarbon core similar to the other one in size , it would be detectable .",
    "we therefore conclude iras 05341 + 0852 is unresolved not because of its remote location , but because the hydrocarbon emission region is intrinsically small in size .",
    "we now have the distribution of hydrocarbon dust in three ppns : the emitting region in iras 05341 + 0852 is unresolved ; in iras 04296 + 3429 it is concentrated but extended up to 400640  au in diameter ; and in iras 22272 + 5435 it is diffuse and widely developed over 2000  au .",
    "this is at least suggestive that there is an evolutionary sequence of the hydrocarbon production in these ppns : iras 05341 + 0852 is in the earliest stage of the evolution , followed by iras 04296 + 3429 , with iras 22272 + 5435 being the most evolved in the post - agb evolution .",
    "although the present sample is small , we do note that there seems to be a correlation between the size of the emitting region and the spectral evolution of the hydrocarbon emission features .",
    "the two trends in the spectral sequence , ( 1 ) the decline of aliphatic emission at 3.4  @xmath0 m with respect to the aromatic emission at 3.3  @xmath0 m , and ( 2 ) the decrease of the overall intensity of hydrocarbon feature integrated at 3.23.6  @xmath0 m , apparently go together with the hydrocarbon emitting region becoming spatially more developed .",
    "it is interesting to note that a similar spectral variation of the aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon features has been reported in the thermal annealing of the laboratory analogs of carbon dust @xcite .",
    "these results show that high spatial resolution infrared imaging spectroscopy has the capability of directly tracing the chemical evolution of circumstellar synthesis of carbonaceous compounds , with significant implications on our understanding of the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium and the galaxy .",
