    "the formational history of early - type galaxies ( etgs : ellipticals and lenticulars ) remains an outstanding question . while these dynamically hot systems may be basically understood as end - products of galaxy mergers , the details of these mergers and their cosmological context are unclear .",
    "high - redshift ( @xmath2 ) observations have made initially surprising discoveries that many etgs were already present at early times with mature stellar populations , and that these galaxies were much more compact than those in the present day .",
    "( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the evolution in etg sizes is still controversial in both observation and interpretation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the most likely scenario is for a combination of effects where individual galaxies grow in size by accretion of smaller , gas - poor galaxies ( an `` inside - out '' picture of galaxy formation ) , and where younger etgs are formed with larger sizes because of their decreased cold gas content and the lower background densities of dark matter ( dm ; e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the role of dm is considered fundamental to the formation of galaxies , and dm halo properties have been extensively studied in cases such as gas - rich spirals and nearby dwarfs which have suitable observational tracers ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "studying dm in the general population of etgs is in many ways more difficult , with ongoing surveys of the available large - radius halo tracers attempting to remedy our ignorance in this area ( e.g. @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter t+09 ) ; @xcite ) .",
    "dm can alternatively be studied with less precision but in more extensive etg samples by considering the well - studied central regions  inside the `` effective radius '' ( ) enclosing half the stellar light , where dm is generally thought to be a minor yet potentially detectable contributor to the mass .",
    "here one of the classic approaches is to analyze the `` fundamental plane '' ( fp ) relating etg sizes , luminosities , and central velocity dispersions ( ) .",
    "the fp shows a `` tilt '' or systematic deviation from simple expectations based on galaxies with constant dynamical mass - to - light ratios , probably implying systematic differences in the stellar populations or in dm content .",
    "after many years of debate , there is still not a consensus on what is driving the fp tilt ( e.g. @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* c+06 hereafter ) ; @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) ; @xcite ) .",
    "some work suggests stellar populations variations or non - homologies in the luminosity profiles as the tilt drivers .",
    "however , it is a fairly generic expectation from the standard cosmological framework for galaxy formation that the central dm content of etgs will systematically increase with luminosity  a point we discussed in paper i and develop further in this paper .",
    "if the fp tilt is _ not _ caused in large part by dm , there could be problems implied for galaxy formation theory . here",
    "one could pursue two different philosophies : to empirically and robustly determine the reasons for the fp tilt without recourse to theory ( e.g. making no assumptions about the underlying dm profiles ) ; or to adopt the theoretical framework as broadly correct and consider the detailed implications for etg composition and formation .",
    "following the second approach , it is now time to begin moving on from phenomenological questions about the fp tilt , and to establish more direct connections between dm in etgs and their formational histories . in particular",
    ", the central dm content could prove crucial to solving the size - evolution puzzles mentioned above , and more fundamentally to understanding the assembly of etgs . to this end",
    ", we now extend the analysis of paper i , which combined models of stellar dynamics and population synthesis to infer _ total _ and _ stellar _ masses in a large sample in nearby galaxies , and thereby to analyze the fp tilt .",
    "there have been previous suggestions that age and star formation timescales are important fourth parameters in the fp @xcite .",
    "we will now explore this possibility systematically , using the results from paper i to consider additional correlations involving dm content and star formation histories ( sfhs ) .",
    "it should be noted at the outset that the data and the analysis techniques that we use for deriving mass and sfh parameters may not be the most state - of - the - art .",
    "however , our aim is to pioneer a framework for interpreting any data of this kind in a broad cosmological context ( where in particular , emerging high-@xmath2 data - sets provide only crude observational constraints on etgs ) , and we are so far able to tentatively identify some basic and intriguing trends .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : observ ] we present our basic observational results .",
    "we go on to analyze some implications of the trends of dm with mass in section  [ sec : dmimp ] and with age in section  [ sec : lcdm2 ] . in section  [ sec : concl ]",
    "we summarize our conclusions .",
    "two appendices include analyses of statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "here we present our basic observational results .",
    "section  [ sec : sample ] provides an overview of our galaxy sample and mass inferences , and summarizes the trends versus mass .",
    "section  [ sec : fdm_sfe ] presents results related to galaxy age .",
    "our starting point is a collection of @xmath3 local etgs from @xcite that we recently re - analyzed in paper i. the sample was selected to have measurements of  and at least two colours , with a subsample of @xmath4 systems that also include the maximum rotation velocity ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "there are 218 elliptical galaxies and 117 lenticular / s0 systems : as shown in paper i , the two subsamples show similar stellar and dm properties and we will consider them jointly in this work .",
    "we next summarize the main steps of the paper i analysis , starting with the stellar population models .",
    "we used a set of simple stellar population ( ssp ) synthetic spectra from the prescription of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bc03 hereafter ) to fit the observed galaxy colours .",
    "we assumed a @xcite or @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) alternatively , with initial masses @xmath6 in the range @xmath7 .",

    "the imf change can then be fairly represented as a simple overall stellar renormalization , which is reduced by a factor of 1.6 in changing from salpeter to kroupa ; see e.g. fig  4 of bc03 . ] .",
    "these single - burst models were convolved with an exponential sfr @xmath9 to generate more general sfhs , where @xmath10 is a characteristic time scale .",
    "the , metallicity ( @xmath11 ) , and @xmath10 were free parameters of the model while stellar , , was inferred from the best - fit solution for each galaxy .",
    "the reliability of the modelling technique and the intrinsic parameter scatter , as well as the presence of spurious correlations among the stellar parameters induced by the stellar modelling procedure , have been checked through monte carlo simulations ( see paper i for details , as well as appendix  [ sec : modsys ] of this paper ) .",
    "in addition , a recent novel , completely independent technique for estimating  using globular cluster systems has yielded results in perfect agreement with ours ( @xcite , fig .",

    "[ fig : ml ] , a fraction of the galaxies ( under any of our imf choices ) appear to have @xmath14 , which would be an unphysical situation .",
    "this is not necessarily a worry , since errors in the  estimates can scatter some data to @xmath14 .",
    "we have investigated this issue quantitatively in appendix  [ sec : unphys ] , finding a strong but not definitive suggestion that some etgs are not compatible with having a salpeter imf .",
    "similar points were made in other studies ( @xcite ; c+06 ; @xcite ) using conceptually similar techniques .",
    "* hereafter t+10 ) on the other hand claimed from an analysis of gravitational lenses that a salpeter imf is preferred , with a possible systematic imf variation .",
    "we will return to these issues in later sections , and for now note that an assumed universal kroupa imf is a reasonable starting point .",
    "we found in paper i that the  value correlates with luminosity and stellar mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fdm_mass ] ) , a trend that could be the _ phenomenological _ cause of the fp tilt .",
    "we also examined the _ formational _ causes of the tilt in paper i ( section 6 ) , using toy models of galaxies in a cosmological context to verify that the expected scaling relations of dm haloes might naturally explain the  trends .",
    "we will develop this theme further in the following sections , and also begin studying the implications of the sfhs .    one basic sfh result is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : downsizing ] : the stellar ages and masses of the galaxies are correlated , providing another example of the well - known `` archaeological downsizing '' phenomenon wherein more massive systems form earliest .",
    "we plan to consider the physical reasons for this downsizing in a subsequent paper , comparing cosmologically - based models for sfhs and dm halo assemblies . here",
    "we will simply treat the sfhs as a given which we will attempt to correlate with dm properties , envisioning these as fundamental ingredients for constraining future theoretical models .      here",
    "we move beyond the fp analysis of paper i and examine in more detail the dm trends , including the connections with sfhs .",
    "we plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fdm_mass ] the empirical values for  versus stellar mass ; the two quantities are correlated albeit with substantial scatter and suggestions of non - monotonicity .",
    "we have also colour - coded the data points in fig .",
    "[ fig : fdm_mass ] by stellar _ age _ , and can see immediately that much of the scatter in might be explained by systematic correlations with sfhs . in particular , _ at a fixed mass the galaxies with the youngest stars are found to have on average the highest dm fractions_. this is a central result of our paper which we consider in more detail below .",
    "trends involving @xmath10 will be studied in a subsequent paper .",
    "we show two other projections of the three - dimensional space of age - mass - in figs .  [",
    "fig : downsizing ] and [ fig : fdm_age ] . the combination of -mass and age - mass correlations ( figs .",
    "[ fig : fdm_mass ] and [ fig : downsizing ] ) suggest that there could be an overall -age correlation",
    ". however , fig .",
    "[ fig : fdm_age ] shows that there is a net _ anti_-correlation between  and age , which implies that  couples more strongly to age than to mass ( we will revisit this issue in section  [ sec : over ] ) .    before analyzing these trends in more detail ,",
    "we consider that there is an important _ fourth _ parameter involved , the effective radius .",
    "this is because  is evaluated at , a variable parameter that has its own systematic dependencies .",
    "as we found in paper i and will revisit below , the well - known etg size - mass relation ( - ) can explain much of the -  trends as an `` aperture effect '' , without invoking any intrinsic variation in the dm properties .",
    "this is because the stellar  varies more quickly with mass than do the inner dm halo properties ( in @xmath1cdm ) , meaning that for a more massive galaxy , the larger encloses a higher fraction of the total dm .",
    "the next question is whether there is a link between  and age that could be driving the -age trends . as mentioned in section  [ sec : intro ] , the size - mass relation is thought to evolve strongly with time , such that etgs at a fixed mass are more compact at earlier times .",
    "this trend can be considered generically to include contributions both from size growth of existing galaxies , and from the birth of new galaxies with systematically larger sizes . as a consequence of the latter effect",
    ", we would expect the population of etgs at a fixed time ( e.g. @xmath15 ) to show a correlation between size and age at fixed mass , such that the older galaxies are smaller .",
    "this qualitative prediction has recently been confirmed by low-@xmath2 observations ( sb09 ; @xcite ) , and we now investigate it for our own etg sample .",
    "we plot  against age in fig .",
    "[ fig : re_age ] , where galaxies are colour - coded according to four fiducial stellar mass bins that we will use throughout the paper : @xmath16  10.3 , 10.8 , 11.2 , 11.6 for a kroupa imf ) .",
    "the overall galaxy distribution does not show any significant dependence of with , but for any given mass there is a clear anti - correlation ( particularly for the most massive galaxies ) , i.e. older galaxies have on average smaller effective radii .",
    "we quantify the size - age dependency by fitting a log - linear relation in each of the mass bins .",
    "the slopes range from @xmath17 to @xmath18 , where the normalization increases with mass in accordance with the typical   relation ( see e.g. paper i ) .",
    "these trends appear to be independent of the galaxy sub - type ( ellipticals versus s0s)which is a crucial point because one might otherwise speculate that the younger objects are s0s with systematically different properties than ellipticals .",
    "these size - age trends might be driven by higher densities of dm and gas at earlier epochs of galaxy formation ( see references in section  [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "however , as with the age - mass correlation , we will for now set aside a physical interpretation of the size - age correlation and simply consider it as a nuisance factor that must be treated appropriately in our later toy models of dm content .",
    "these size - age results are not meant to be universally applicable to etgs but are a characterization of this particular data - set as needed for our self - consistent galaxy toy models .",
    "the size - age trends clearly go in the right direction to explain the -age trends : older galaxies could exhibit lower  simply because their  values are smaller , so smaller volumes of their dm haloes are probed . in principle , one might be able to see directly from the data whether  is more directly coupled to age or to , and to this end we have highlighted the high- and low-  galaxies in fig .",
    "[ fig : re_age ] .",
    "however , it is not immediately obvious whether  or age is the stronger factor , probably because of the scatter in the data . instead ,",
    "in the next section we will adopt a model - dependent approach , attempting to make sense of the observed trends in the context of standard dm+galaxy models .    before continuing , in appendix  [ sec : app ]",
    "we carry out a number of cross - checks on the robustness of our basic -age result .",
    "first , comparing independent constraints from the literature we find some support for an -age anti - correlation .",
    "however , there may be disagreement in the _ residual _ -age trend after accounting for the -age relations ( which we examine further in the following sections ) .",
    "such differences illustrate the need for further in - depth study of this topic .",
    "we also check in appendix  [ sec : app ] the effects of our stellar populations modelling assumptions , finding that our main conclusions are fairly insensitive to these .    besides the systematic uncertainties ,",
    "there is the issue of the statistical errors being correlated , in the sense that an error in age correlates with an error in and produces an artificial -age anti - correlation ( see error ellipse in fig .",
    "[ fig : fdm_age ] ) . to gauge this effect",
    ", we have simulated mock data - sets with random errors applied to the ages , propagated these to errors on , and then regenerated the -age plot .",
    "the artificial trend generated by the errors turns out to change the slope by only @xmath19  gyr@xmath20 ( compared to the observed slope of @xmath21  gyr@xmath20 ) .",
    "we will continue in the rest of this paper to assume that our empirical results are correct , and go on to examine the implications for galaxy structure and formation .",
    "given the preceding inferred dm trends , we begin here with interpretations of the mass dependencies , constructing @xmath1cdm - based toy models in section  [ sec : lcdm1 ] .",
    "we consider dm density profiles in section  [ sec : profs ] , and comparisons to related literature results in section  [ sec : context ] .",
    "we now construct a series of toy models of galaxies including dm haloes based on @xmath1cdm theory , as previously done in @xcite and in paper i. with this approach we are not modelling individual galaxies but generating typical representatives in the space of mass and age .",
    "each model is spherically symmetric and is comprised of a stellar spheroid and a dm halo .",
    "the spheroid has a srsic density distribution with an @xmath22-index as described in paper i , and an --age dependence taken from the log - linear fits in fig .",
    "[ fig : re_age ] .",
    "the dm halo has an nfw density profile @xcite following a typical concentration - virial mass ( @xmath23-@xmath24 ) relation @xcite .",
    "we have also derived models based on a more recent estimate of @xmath25 @xcite , which predict lower central dm content , but only at the level of changing  by @xmath26 . ] .",
    "the dm halo is optionally `` adiabatically contracted '' , which is an approximate way to model the expected drag of dissipatively infalling baryons on the surrounding dm , producing a halo with a higher central dm density than in collisionless @xmath27-body simulations .",
    "the two ac recipes we use are the most common ones , from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b+86 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter g+04 ) , with the latter providing a weaker ( and probably more realistic ) effect .",
    "other recipes are also available ( e.g. @xcite ) , but a more important caveat is that the entire slow , smooth - infall ac scenario may not be correct for forming cosmological structures  particularly the etgs which may have experienced relatively violent , clumpy assembly histories .",
    "current high - resolution simulations do suggest that the standard ac models are not accurate in detail , and that the baryonic effects on dm haloes might be highly variable and stochastic @xcite . for simplicity , we will consider our ac and no - ac models as representing two extreme models of galaxy formation , where the baryons have alternatively strong or weak net impact on the dm halo ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    in order to match the galaxies to their haloes",
    ", we must relate their stellar masses to their total ( or virial ) halo masses .",
    "we can parameterize this connection by assuming the cosmological baryonic fraction , @xmath28 @xcite , is conserved within each halo .",
    "the stellar mass is then given by an efficiency of star formation @xmath29 , so that @xmath30 .",
    "we use a series of plausible values @xmath31 ( e.g. @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s+10 ) ) .",
    "we also adopt the kroupa imf as our fiducial choice but consider the impact of salpeter or chabrier imfs .",
    "our model has effectively three free `` parameters '' : , adiabatic contraction ( ac ) recipe and imf choice .",
    "[ fig : vcprofs ] shows an example of a series of galaxy toy models for fixed stellar halo masses , and varying ac assumptions .",
    "it can be seen that the dm content inside 1  varies most by changing from a no - ac model to an ac model .",
    "the choice between the b+86 and g+04 recipes makes only a small difference on these scales .",
    "this model may seem simple , but as far as we know _ it has never been applied to the fp before _ , except for the related study of s+10 as we discuss later .",
    "we now begin by deriving the predicted dm fraction within  as a function of mass , in bins of constant age ( i.e. fixing the  values for a given mass ) , and with a number of different assumptions on  and ac recipe .",

    "( although there are suspicions of salpeter not being a valid alternative : see section  [ sec : sample ] ) .    for any fixed imf",
    ", we see that it is a fairly generic expectation in a @xmath1cdm context for  to increase systematically with , and to produce a dm - driven tilt in the fp .",
    "the reason is the aperture effect mentioned earlier : the scale - lengths of galaxies stellar parts change more rapidly than for their haloes , causing the  region to encompass increasingly large amounts of dm .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the -  trends in fig .  [",
    "fig : fdm_re ] and by various fp analyses in the literature based on simulations of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "a similar point from an observational basis is made by fig .",
    "5 of @xcite , and we include their results for comparison in fig .  [",
    "fig : fdm_re ] ; here the absolute values of  can not be readily compared since their  values come from the @xmath32-band and should be systematically different from ours in the @xmath33-band , but their general trend with size seems comparable to ours .",
    "the role of  in more model - dependent dm scalings is considered further in section  [ sec : profs ] .",
    "systematic trends in  can affect the slope of -  in either direction , but the effect is fairly weak . even for a factor of 7 change in assumed halo mass ,  changes only by @xmath8  0.1 ; i.e. large changes in overall halo mass do not translate to large changes in central dm content . to cancel out the dm - induced tilt ,  would have to systematically increase with mass , which goes in the opposite direction to conventional findings , wherein the most massive systems have the highest virial @xmath34 . if the fp tilt turns out to _ not _ be driven by  trends ( as found in @xcite ) , then this would be inconsistent with vanilla @xmath1cdm expectations ( i.e. , where central dm densities scale slowly relative to the observed stellar densities ) .",
    "we next consider some interesting implications for dm density profiles with radius .",
    "it is notoriously difficult to determine the dm content in the centres of etgs , and scant few studies to - date have been able to compare the empirical dm properties to @xmath1cdm theory . t+09 and paper i ( fig .",
    "14 ) have found mean central densities for dm haloes that scale with mass roughly as expected for nfw haloes .",
    "here we add the finding that the dm content also scales ( to first order ) with galaxy size as expected .",
    "we will see in section  [ sec : over ] that much of the observed -age anti - correlation can be traced to the -age anti - correlation  implying that our @xmath1cdm toy models are at least roughly correct .",
    "this point is illustrated more clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhore ] , where for one example mass bin , the stellar mass has been subtracted from the total mass , and the residual dm content is quantified as the mean value within , .    by measuring the dm content of individual galaxies with similar masses at different radii , we are effectively able to map out a mean dm density profile over a factor of 3 in radius .",
    "this trick of studying composite profiles is formally valid only if the binned galaxies all have approximately the same dm profile  as might be the case for a no - ac nfw model .",
    "the condition is clearly violated for models that include ac since the contraction varies among the differently - sized galaxies .",
    "however , the impact of this non - homology is reasonably small as discussed further below , such that we can get an approximate idea of the dm slopes , as well as more firmly test the null hypothesis of a universal nfw profile _ total _ density profile in order to extrapolate the  measurements to .",
    "however , we have confirmed that using the alternative constant-@xmath34 profile yields similar results ( @xmath35 unchanged for salpeter imf , and _ steeper _ by @xmath36  0.10.2 for kroupa imf ) .",
    "a galaxy sample with direct mass constraints nearer to ( e.g. c+06 ; @xcite ) would be ideal for pursuing the density profile analysis more robustly .",
    "we have also checked that these results are not sensitive to the stellar populations models ( appendix  [ sec : modsys ] ) . ] .",
    "the first point to notice from fig .",
    "[ fig : rhore ] is that the data for  and  ( see fig .  [ fig : fdm_re ] ) have opposite trends versus , which turns out to be crucial evidence for cuspy dm haloes on scales of @xmath8  215  kpc . as  increases for a fixed galaxy mass and halo profile , the amount of enclosed dm and therefore  both increase . on the other hand ,",
    "the local dm density of a cuspy halo decreases with radius , so a larger  means a smaller .",
    "more quantitatively , we may consider a general power - law density scaling for the central dm halo , @xmath37 .",
    "for @xmath38 , @xmath39 and therefore @xmath40 .",
    "for an uncontracted nfw halo , @xmath41 at the smallest radii , but near  in our toy models , @xmath42  1.11.3 ( steeper for higher masses because of their larger radii ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "ac effectively makes the dm even cuspier , with @xmath42  1.61.8 for the g+04 recipe , and @xmath42  1.81.9 for b+86 ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : vcprofs ] ) .",
    "the effect of constructing composite profiles from non - universal haloes is for the apparent slopes to be steeper by @xmath43 .",
    "this offset can be subtracted from the observational results to estimate the true slopes ( see below ) , while more rigorous tests are made by constructing composite toy models for comparison to the data .",
    "our observational results for a kroupa imf are illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : rhore ] ( top ) .",
    "the vast majority of the data points in this fixed mass bin do appear to clump around a common dm mass profile , with a composite slope of @xmath44 ( so we may infer a true slope of @xmath45 ) .",
    "a small minority of galaxies may follow a shallower trend , with a residual trend of dm fraction versus age that is barely visible by the colourisation of the data points ( to be discussed in section  [ sec : over ] ) .",
    "the results for the other mass bins are similar , with @xmath462.1 , and suggestions of a shallower slope with increasing mass ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : densize ] ) , although it is hard to tell for sure since the exact slopes are sensitive to the details of the fitting procedure  1.82.2 , becoming shallower with increasing mass .",
    "this trend is driven mostly by the stellar density becoming shallower , and is affected little by ac . ] .",
    "we also construct nfw - based model predictions as in section  [ sec : lcdm1 ] and show them in fig .  [",
    "fig : rhore ] .",
    "the steep slope for the majority of the points , along with the shallower slope with increasing mass , turns out to correspond nicely to a range of nfw+ac models , with a minority of points consistent with uncontracted nfw haloes .",
    "the model interpretations are somewhat degenerate to systematic variations of  with ( e.g. s+10 suggest an anti - correlation , which would imply the intrinsic slopes are steeper than they appear ) .",
    "however , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhore ] , the  effects are fairly small , and overshadowed by our fitting uncertainties anyway .",
    "the -  relation is not a knock - down confirmation of @xmath1cdm but intriguingly it does seem to weigh against alternative models . if there is no dm , then of course we should have @xmath47 , although there might be a systematic error in the mass analysis , e.g. with the imf . in this more general case",
    "we expect @xmath48 , and the apparent  to be constant with age and in strong contradiction to the data .",
    "the same argument may apply to , and pose a challenge for , alternative gravity theories that seek to explain observational mass discrepancies at large galactic radii , usually in spiral galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to consider any of these theories in detail , but we will briefly comment on the most well studied case of modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ; e.g. ) . in this formalism , there is a characteristic acceleration scale @xmath49  cm  s@xmath50 , above which mass discrepancies should be weak or nonexistent . in the central regions of the etgs studied here , the accelerations are large @xmath51 and the dynamical mass should agree well with the inferred stellar mass .    our observed mass discrepancies , along with the striking  dependencies , would at first glance appear to rule out mond without dm in etgs , which might be related to similar results in galaxy groups and clusters ( e.g. ) . however , we can not make a definitive statement without carrying out a careful mondian analysis ( see also fig .  19 in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter g+01 ) ; preliminary findings in @xcite ; and forthcoming results in @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the systematic uncertainties in our  and  estimates must be taken into account , along with possible fine - tuning of the `` interpolation function '' between the newtonian and mondian regimes ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "if there are dm haloes with cored profiles ( e.g. @xcite ) , then  would still increase with , but  should be constant ( @xmath52 ) . again , using the wrong imf could contribute an @xmath48 effect , which in combination with a constant dm core could produce a shallower than @xmath48 trend  but experimenting with imf adjustments , we can not recover a constant - core trend .",
    "any of these scenarios could still be salvaged with epicycles , e.g. with systematic errors that correlate with galaxy size , but ockham s razor suggests the first conclusion should be to prefer a standard cuspy dm model .",
    "note that detailed dynamical models of individual galaxies have difficulty uniquely decomposing the stellar and dm mass profiles and thereby distinguishing between cored and cusped dm haloes ( cf .",
    "t+09 ; ( * ? ? ?",

    "this is clearly not correct in general since in the modern picture of `` downsizing '' , the star formation in massive galaxies largely precedes the dm assembly , and vice - versa in less massive systems ( e.g. fig .  5 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is beyond the scope of this paper to consider differential assembly histories at fixed final mass , so for now we will adopt our simple prescription as stated above .    to a good approximation , haloes of all masses and at all times `` collapse '' with a fixed concentration of @xmath74 ;",
    "the subsequent concentration evolution is basically mediated by the expansion of the universe .",

    "we then fit our @xmath1cdm toy models ( section  [ sec : lcdm1 ] ) to the  data . given a fixed imf and dm profile ( nfw with or without ac ) , the remaining free parameters are now  and @xmath78 .",
    "we fix  to be constant in each mass bin , and set it to a value that forces the average @xmath78 ( including all ages ) to approximately agree with the theoretically predicted mean value .",
    "note that for models with ac , the @xmath78 value denotes the `` original '' concentration after correcting the observations for ac .",

    "we find @xmath79 for the lowest mass bin , and @xmath80 for the others ; it is noteworthy that such a simple , plausible @xmath1cdm - motivated model can be constructed to agree with both central and global dm constraints for etgs .",
    "now considering the age dependencies , we see that there is a clear trend for older galaxies to have less concentrated haloes  an effect that is diametrically opposed to our assumed trend for star formation to mimic halo collapse .",
    "if taken at face value , these concentration results would imply that etgs on average formed their stars not long after their haloes collapsed ( @xmath81 versus @xmath82 ) , but the late - collapsing haloes tended to form their stars very early ( @xmath83 versus @xmath84 ) while the early - collapsing haloes formed their stars very late ( @xmath85 versus @xmath86)although these latter trends are more apparent for the low - mass galaxies .",
    "we are not aware of any physical mechanism that would produce such counterintuitive variations _ at a fixed mass _ , and we suspect that concentration effects do not explain the observed dm - age trends .",
    "these conclusions are similar when adopting a salpeter imf with no ac .      the next alternative for systematic differences in the dm profiles is that the radial profiles have been systematically affected by baryons in different ways .",
    "the simplest picture in this context is for ac strength to vary with age .",
    "we do not explore this effect in detail , but refer to fig .",
    "[ fig : lcdm_fdmage ] for a qualitative understanding . if the imf has a slightly higher mass normalization than kroupa ( or if the  values are somewhat lower than the range adopted so far ) , then the youngest galaxies are consistent with the b+86 ac recipe , with ac strength decreasing with age until the oldest galaxies have had no ac .",
    "variations in  would then play a minor role in the central dm trends . in principle , we could confirm this interpretation by examining the  radial profiles for different age bins , but the data are currently too noisy for this purpose .",
    "is there any theoretical reason to expect ac to correlate with stellar age in this way ? or more generally , since we do not directly confirm the ac models , why should the dm be preferentially shifted away from the centres of `` older '' galaxies , and towards the centres of `` younger '' galaxies , by baryonic effects ?",
    "one possibility concerns the smoothness of baryonic infall : the standard ac model is motivated by smooth gaseous dissipation , while clumpier collapse  both in the baryons and in the dm  is expected to diminish or even reverse the contraction because of `` feedback '' from dynamical friction ( e.g. @xcite ) .    alternatively",
    ", more direct baryonic feedback could occur via outflows from agns and supernovae , potentially puffing up the dm halo ( e.g. ) .",
    "the notion of feedback effects on dm haloes is becoming commonplace , but the puzzle here is how to explain a systematic trend with time .",
    "realistic simulations of galaxy formation including baryonic processes are only now becoming powerful enough to investigate such questions in detail .    one specific scenario worth special mention is the emerging paradigm of high-@xmath2 massive galaxy formation by cold streams of dm and baryons @xcite . the clumpiness of the infall in this picture could effectively bypass the contraction process ( as proposed by @xcite ) .",
    "these `` wild disk '' galaxies are though to initially form hot stellar disks and bulges in situ , and then evolve into low-@xmath2 ellipticals , s0s , and early - type spirals  whether by passive fading or by eventual merging @xcite .",
    "we would like to connect the dm - age trends for etgs with the impacts of physical processes in the cosmological context of galaxy formation . to begin doing so ,",
    "let us first consider even broader questions relating the different _ types _ of massive galaxies . as discussed in section  [ sec : context ] , our initial assessment of low-@xmath2 galaxies is that the early - types have haloes with ac , and the late - types without ac .",
    "this type difference is not simply an age difference since among the etgs , younger galaxies appear to have _ stronger _ ac .",
    "these observations raise an interesting cladistical question : if etgs are generally formed in the mergers of spirals per the conventional wisdom , do they have roughly the same central dm densities ?",
    "also , if the most massive etgs are assembled by dry mergers of smaller etgs , are their respective dm densities consistent with this picture ?    a related problem",
    "was raised long ago for the _ stellar _ densities of galaxies .",
    "it is well known that in the merger of collisionless systems , the phase space density @xmath87 can not be increased , but observationally the central stellar @xmath87 values of etgs are much higher than those of spirals @xcite .",
    "this puzzle was solved by taking into account the dissipational infall of gas during a merger , forming new stars in a high - density central starburst ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "returning to the dm issues , the 6d density @xmath87 is of course not the same as the 3d density @xmath88 , or 2d @xmath89 , but we will not carry out a rigorous analysis of @xmath87 here ( e.g. @xcite ) , but the results are very sensitive to how the dm dispersion @xmath90 is handled , and will require more careful analysis . ] . instead , noting that discrepancies involving @xmath87 tend to be associated with @xmath88 and @xmath89 problems , we will take a very simplified approach of conserving mass : the amount of central dm in a merger remnant should be roughly equal to the sum of the progenitors central dm ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the observed dm density differences between early- and late - types appear from figs .",
    "[ fig : densize ] and [ fig : surfden ] to be factors of @xmath8  5 . however , in this context the figures are difficult to interpret because the two galaxy types occupy an almost disjoint region of -  space .",
    "comparison of the small samples of overlapping objects in this space indicate the real density differences may only be @xmath8  2 on average .",
    "we illustrate the trends in a different way in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhom ] , where the mean densities are plotted against stellar masses , in bins of similar physical radius .",
    "the simplest expectation here for galaxy mergers is that the dm density within the same radius grows linearly with mass , which the figure shows is borne out remarkably well if considering the spirals as the progenitors of the etgs .",
    "the full story is more complicated , as the true etg progenitors are thought to have been high-@xmath2 gas - rich systems with dense dm haloes ( e.g. discussions in section  [ sec : con ] and in g+01 and t+09 ) .",
    "also , there are potential effects in the mergers that could raise or lower the densities relative to the linear relation .",
    "a detailed theoretical exploration of dm density changes in mergers would be a useful contribution at this point , using also the constraint that the etg haloes appear cuspier than those of the spirals .",
    "however , we can conclude that so far there does not appear to be an obvious problem in generating etg halo densities from late - type progenitors .    now returning to the dm trends with _ age _ in the etgs",
    ", progenitor bias seems an unlikely explanation .",
    "higher dm densities in the early progenitors would produce the _ opposite _ low-@xmath2 correlations to what we observe , and furthermore current observations of candidate high-@xmath2 progenitors indicate relatively _ low _ central dm content , similar to low-@xmath2 spirals @xcite .",
    "instead , the possibility then remains that halo contraction or expansion is a strong function of @xmath2 .",
    "the scenario would be for halo contraction to become more important for etgs that formed at later times , perhaps in a transition from the cold stream phenomenon discussed above , to a more merger - dominated evolution that produces stronger contraction .",
    "early , strong feedback might also play a role .",
    "an additional effect to consider is dissipationless merging of etgs : with repeated dry mergers , the initially segregated stellar and dm profiles should eventually converge to a well - mixed nfw - type profile for the _ total _ mass , implying a net migration of dm toward the galaxy s centre",
    ". one might surmise on this basis that older galaxies would have increased central dm content because of their longer post - star - formation period of merging .",
    "the simulations of @xcite highlighted the effect of  augmentation through dry merging .",
    "however , the main  driver here may be the aperture effect due to the merger - induced  growth ( as the results of @xcite suggest ) , rather than a significant evolution of the dm profile itself .",
    "after exhausting a litany of possibilities for dm properties to vary with age , we consider the alternative that our dm inferences are wrong because we have assumed a universal imf when estimating the stellar @xmath34 values .",
    "the implication would then be that the imf varies systematically with stellar age , in the sense that younger galaxies have a higher - mass imf : i.e. , they have more stellar mass for a given luminosity , so the high _ dynamical _ @xmath34 observations are due not to excess dm but to higher @xmath91 . in this context , when we couch the imf in terms of `` salpeter '' and `` kroupa '' , we will not literally mean the same detailed imf shape as those functions , but rather an equivalent overall  normalization .",
    "the subject of imf variations is highly controversial and unresolved : for a review see @xcite .",
    "there are theoretical reasons to expect lower - mass imfs for stellar populations that formed in the early universe @xcite , and observational suggestions for imfs to be lower - mass at higher @xmath2 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these ideas would fit in well with the imf - age trend we suggest above .",
    "all these results might further be consistent with suggestions that the imf becomes more top - heavy at higher sfrs @xcite , since sfrs should have generally been higher at earlier times .",
    "similarly , the more compact nature of the older etgs might imply higher gas densities in the star - forming epoch , which has also been suggested to produce more top - heavy imfs @xcite .",
    "to be more quantitative about the implied imf variations , we construct a simple ad hoc model as follows . first we derive an average -  trend based on the data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fdm_mass ] ) , and for each individual galaxy , solve for the  value that would agree with this trend ( given its individual  value ) .",
    "this value can be expressed relative to the observed salpeter - based value by a fraction @xmath92 ( cf .",

    "however , these authors did not allow for ac in their models , which may impact their conclusions .    as mentioned above",
    ", there are reasons to expect an imf - age trend for etgs qualitatively similar to our toy model interpretation .",
    "( further analysis would be required to check for problems involving fp twisting with redshift ; cf . .",
    ") now considering also late - types as relatively young , low - sfr , low - density systems , we would expect their imfs to be more bottom - heavy ( high ) .",
    "mergers of these systems to form the younger present - day etgs would then also be expected to result in bottom - heavy imfs , which is qualitatively consistent with the trend from fig .",
    "[ fig : imf0 ] , but might be in conflict with imf constraints in low-@xmath2 galaxy disks .",
    "we have continued an analysis begun in paper i of a large data - set of nearby early - type galaxies ( etgs ) , combining dynamics and stellar populations to constrain the central dm content . after having identified variations in dm as the main cause of the tilt of the fundamental plane",
    ", we have moved on to consider various scaling relations of the dm haloes , and connections to the star formation histories of the galaxies .",
    "our basic observational findings are that the central dm fraction within an effective radius  has a strong anti - correlation with stellar age , and that the galaxy sizes also have an age anti - correlation .",
    "we have constructed composite profiles of dm density with radius , finding that they are on average cuspy , with inferred density exponents of @xmath93 near .",
    "these profiles are steeper than literature findings for spiral galaxies , and the central dm densities of the early - types are denser overall , suggesting that gas - rich mergers would need to produce a net halo contraction .    to further interpret the data , we have generated a series of @xmath1cdm toy models , including variable contributions from adiabatic contraction ( ac ) .",
    "the results from comparisons of models to data are :    * models with ac fit well overall with a kroupa imf , while models without ac prefer a salpeter imf . *",
    "the size - age trends can explain _ part _ of the -age trends : older galaxies show less evidence for dm because their more compact stellar centres probe less volume of the dm halo . * the remaining -age trends are not easily explained by variations in halo mass or concentration , and suggest differences in baryonic effects on the dm , in the sense that younger galaxies have undergone ac while older galaxies have not . *",
    "an alternative scenario is for the imf to be less massive for older stellar populations .",
    "there is ample scope for future insights and improvements .",
    "we plan to further investigate the galaxies star formation histories in the context of theoretical mass assembly histories .",
    "environmental trends can be investigated , as these are expected to be important ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "forthcoming high - quality , homogeneous , multiwavelength large surveys of low - redshift etgs should also be able to refute , confirm or extend the trends presented here @xcite .",
    "finally , the gold standard for probing galaxy mass profiles is extended kinematics data along with detailed dynamical modelling  both to provide more leverage on the dm independently of the stellar mass , and to sift individual galaxies for the presence of a dm core or cusp ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "even if some of our current conclusions turn out to be completely wrong , we hope to have introduced a useful framework for interpreting mass results for large data sets of etgs over cosmic time .",
    "the dm constraints are part of a spectrum of clues that can ultimately be combined to pin down the modes of etg formation ( e.g. @xcite ) . other avenues with considerable promise include central rotation @xcite , extra light @xcite and orbital structure @xcite , as well as halo rotation @xcite and metallicity gradients @xcite , and globular cluster constraints @xcite .",

    "our derivation of  from estimates of  and  yields a number of cases where galaxies have an unphysical @xmath14 .",

    "; we consider systematics separately ) .",
    "the value of @xmath32 was found by c+06 to have a @xmath8  15% scatter .",
    "the net uncertainty in  is then @xmath8  23% , and the uncertainty on  varies from @xmath8  0.1 to @xmath8  0.2 for high to low  values .",
    "we begin by assuming some fraction of the galaxy sample have true @xmath99 , which we find is the lowest plausible value in a @xmath1cdm context ( section  [ sec : lcdm1 ] ) . using the uncertainties discussed above , we generate a random sample of  measurements and scale a histogram of their frequency to reproduce the number of @xmath14 observations while not exceeding any of the @xmath100 frequencies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : neg ] ) . for the chabrier and kroupa imfs",
    ", this scaling process implies that @xmath8  15% of the sample have @xmath99 . for the salpeter imf on the other hand ,",
    "it is difficult to find a scaling that reproduces the negative-  tail without violating the observed distribution to higher values ; the best fit has @xmath8  55% with @xmath99 .",
    "this difficulty with salpeter would be eased if a true @xmath101 is assumed for half the galaxies , if there were systematic errors at the level of @xmath8  15% , or if the random  measurement errors were actually at the level of @xmath8  25% , or were non - gaussian .",
    "we would not at present rule out any of these possibilities and so can not categorically exclude a universal salpeter imf . recalibrating our @xmath102 and @xmath56 estimates to external results (",
    "as discussed in paper i appendix a ) would on the other hand make the situation more problematic for salpeter by increasing the number of objects with @xmath14 .",
    "here we carry out various tests on the robustness of the dm - age trends found in section  [ sec : fdm_sfe ] . in section  [ sec : appfdm ] we compare our  results to other literature results , and in section  [ sec : larger ] we examine the implications of results at larger radii .",
    "we explore systematic effects in our stellar populations models in section  [ sec : modsys ] .",
    "we check here whether our results on central  and age are consistent with other results in the literature .",
    "first we consider the sdss - based analysis of sb09 .",
    "they estimated central dynamical and stellar masses for a large sample of etgs at @xmath103  0.10.2 using somewhat different techniques to ours in paper i. after correcting the galaxy luminosities to a common age , they found total  trends that depend systematically on age ( their fig .  2 ) .",
    "using the information in @xcite to convert these corrected luminosities to stellar masses , we convert their  values to @xmath104 and then to .",
    "it also appears that they assumed a chabrier imf , so we further convert their results to a kroupa imf for comparison with our default models and results .",
    "the results of this exercise are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sb09 ] : there are indications of an anti - correlation between  and age , particularly for the higher mass bins . for comparison ,",
    "our results are also plotted ; other than a 30% overall offset in  whose origin is unclear , the results are generally consistent .",
    "the sb09 data do suggest somewhat shallower correlations that might be explained by a pure -age effect ( as stated by these authors ) but they do not cover a large enough range in age to be sure .    @xcite carried out a different analysis of quiescent etgs in the sdss .",
    "they again analyzed the central dynamical and stellar masses separately , and mapped various stellar populations parameters on approximate slices of the fp defined by  and .",
    "although these results do imply a systematic correlation between size and age at fixed mass , if one considers a single -  grid - point , then one can control for size and mass dependencies and look for any residual correlations in the perpendicular direction of _ surface brightness_.    these authors found a negative correlation between age and surface brightness , which because dynamical mass is approximately constant implies that there is a positive correlation between age and overall .",
    "they mentioned that in a forthcoming paper they will find that stellar populations effects are not enough to explain this age-  correlation , which therefore implies a net positive age-  correlation .",
    "this result is _ opposite _ to the trend that we find for a residual negative age-  correlation after the age-  correlations are accounted for .",
    "it remains to be seen exactly how and why our results differ .",
    "@xcite fig .",
    "4 provides an intriguing compilation of comparisons between  and  at @xmath15 and @xmath105 for etgs from c+06 and @xcite .",
    "while there are many issues in making such a direct comparison between the two galaxy samples the apparent trend does agree qualitatively with our results , although we can not evaluate the potential residuals from a size - driven trend ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sb09 ] ) .    since @xcite among others emphasize the primary importance of  ( rather than ) in correlating with stellar populations parameters , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : fdmsig0 ] our results for -age in bins of constant .",
    "the trends are similar to those found in bins of constant .",
    "however , we do not use  in general in this paper because it is less straightforward to incorporate in the toy models , and because  depends on a dynamical mass determination that is intrinsically correlated with .",
    "next we consider dm conclusions from dynamical studies extending to large galactocentric radii , quantified as the  gradient parameter introduced in @xcite .",
    "the data - set of 25 galaxies is from paper i ( fig .",
    "c2 , with an update on ngc  4374 from napolitano et al .",
    ", in prep ) , where we confirmed that the gradient correlated well with  from the central regions .",
    "we show some of our toy model predictions from this paper in fig .",
    "[ fig : grad ] ( upper left panel ) . in the absence of any residual dm - age trends , the gradient is expected to decrease with age , since it is defined relative to the galaxy , which in turn decreases with age .    at first glance , the data appear to support this expectation , with the residuals unclear because of the scatter .",
    "however , closer examination of the data - sets plotted raises a red flag : the four `` young '' , dm - dominated galaxies are all well - known nearby massive group- and cluster - central ellipticals that are normally thought to have very old stellar populations ( averaged over ) , _ not _ with ages @xmath8  45 gyr ( ngc  1407 , m49 , m87 , ngc  5846 ; e.g. c+06 ; @xcite ) .",
    "it turns out that these galaxies were all fitted with an unrealistic super - solar metallicity ( @xmath106 ) which is probably a reflection of the fundamental age - metallicity degeneracy in stellar populations analyses .",
    "we re - ran our analysis with all the metallicities fixed to @xmath107 , which for the four problematic galaxies yielded more credible ages of 14  gyr , the age and results with fixed @xmath11 are _ not _ exactly the same as before .",
    "this is because our procedure does not involve a simple best fit , but rather a monte carlo approach using the median of a distribution of best - fit values : see paper i. ] .",
    "the revised @xmath34-gradient results are shown in the top right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : grad ] , where it now appears that the dm content may _ increase _ with age .",
    "the first thing to keep in mind when considering this apparent inconsistency with our main -age result is that the dm content within and within @xmath8  5   may very well _ not _ be tightly correlated . the central dm",
    "content may be less a reflection of the overall dm content and more closely related to the details of the baryonic - dm interplay at the centres of haloes .",
    "the main effect however appears to be small number statistics coupled with selection effects . in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : grad ] we show the  results for both metallicity assumptions .",
    "the stellar @xmath34 is not very sensitive to the age - metallicity degeneracy , and in fact is affected in a way that roughly parallels the overall -age trend : higher age and lower @xmath11 yield higher @xmath108 and lower .",
    "thus the general trend for our full sample is not qualitatively affected by changing @xmath11 , but quantitatively shifts to larger ages overall ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] ) .",
    "the subsample of galaxies that have large - radius data is not so fortunate . when fixing @xmath107 , their -age results buck the overall trend , just as seen from the large - radius results .",
    "this sample has only one `` young '' object ( @xmath109  7 gyr ) , and the old objects are dominated by systems like m87 which are known to reside at the centres of massive groups and clusters , and appear to comprise the high- tail of the overall distribution .",
    "such galaxies are some of the first targets of large - radius dynamical studies because of their rich supply of mass tracers such as globular clusters and planetary nebulae .",
    "the price to pay from selecting such systems is that they could provide a very biassed view of the universe  as now appears to be the case when considering central dm content .",
    "this selection effect may explain the curious dm halo mass - concentration trends found by n+09 , and demonstrates the importance of constructing an unbiassed galaxy sample .",
    "for now , the dm - age implications from large - radius tracers are totally inconclusive , and will require completion of a large systematic survey to make any progress . in the meantime ,",
    "valuable spot - checks could be provided by studying the large - radius dm content of a few galaxies that help drive the apparent -age relation , e.g. young dm - rich systems like ngc  3626 or old dm - poor ones like ngc  7454 .",
    "we next consider whether systematic uncertainties in our stellar populations modelling could be affecting our dm inferences .",
    "we have already explored this issue for the -mass relations in paper i ; here we consider -age .",
    "age and stellar  are both derived from the same models , and a positive error in age would correlate with a positive error in stellar which would produce a _ negative _ error in  and thus mimic an anti - correlated -age trend solely because of the correlated errors .    to see if such a systematic could account for our observational result , we experiment with different stellar populations assumptions , showing the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] .",
    "the only cases where the -age trend is appreciably different from our standard estimate is when we unrealistically fix @xmath106 ( green lines ) .",
    "given the problem identified in section  [ sec : larger ] where allowing the metallicity to vary freely can result in too many `` young '' galaxies , we consider in particular our results when we fix @xmath110 .",
    "the implications for  were shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : grad ] ( right panels ) and [ fig : models ] ( solid orange line ) , and we also show the overall -  trend in fig .  [",
    "fig : modrhodm ] .",
    "the results are similar to our standard model .    as a reminder , in paper i ( appendix a )",
    "we compared independent estimates of  and  to c+06 for galaxies in common .",
    "our  values for the same imf were @xmath8  20% lower , and our  values were higher ( by @xmath8  10% for the brighter galaxies and",
    "@xmath8  30% for the fainter galaxies ) . thus our  values are systematically higher , becoming more discrepant for fainter galaxies ( up to @xmath111 ) .",
    "the c+06 results on their own may imply consistency with no - ac models for the fainter galaxies , and strong ac for the brighter ones @xcite , which would be in better agreement with the results of n+09 .",
    "we have also checked the -age trends using a recalibration as discussed in paper i , and found that for the fainter galaxies , the anti - correlation becomes somewhat _",
    "steeper _ , so our basic -age result does not go away .",
    "an issue not discussed in paper i is the potential effect of agn emission on the observed galaxy colours and thus on the  and age inferences .",
    "the agn colours would generally mimic a stellar population of @xmath8  3  gyr age and skew the inferences toward younger ages and higher . matching the sdss dr4 etg catalogue with the agn catalogue of @xcite",
    ", we find that @xmath8  15% of the galaxies in our sample s mass range have strong agns ( type ii with strong [ o iii ] emission ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , based on the agn study of @xcite , we estimate that the contaminant light would account for only @xmath8  12% of the total light within , and would bias our results by at most 5% ."
