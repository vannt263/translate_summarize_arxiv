    "the idea that the universe is comprised of any number of extra dimensions , in addition to the three non - compact spatial dimensions that we observe , goes back all the way to the work of kaluza and klein in the 1920 s @xcite , where extra dimensions were first proposed as a manner in which one could unify particle interactions with gravity .",
    "since then , theories with extra dimensions have evolved from being a mathematical curiosity , albeit one with remarkable consequences for particle physics @xcite , to a theoretical necessity with the advent of string theory . since the famous anomalies cancellation calculation of green and schwarz @xcite",
    ", the challenge has remained for cosmologists and phenomenologists alike to account for the presence of extra dimensions in physics . from a pessimist s point of view",
    ", one might view these extra dimensions as an unwanted surplus that has to be swept under the rug at presently accessible energies . in its most unimaginative form",
    ", one could view this as the gist of the moduli problem . from an optimist s point of view however",
    ", one could view the requirement of extra dimensions for the consistency of string theory as a new window of opportunity , through which one might be able to resolve some of the outstanding problems of particle physics and cosmology .",
    "taken as an essential part of the radically new picture of space - time that string theory offers us , extra dimensions , with strings and branes of various dimensions propagating through them , could offer us a potentially non - anthropic explanation for the observed dimensionality of space - time @xcite .",
    "in addition to offering us potentially non - singular cosmologies @xcite , they could very well be at the heart of the resolution of the dark matter problem @xcite . recently",
    ", several alternative stringy cosmologies have emerged as possible successors to the standard big bang model of the universe , such as the pre - big bang model @xcite , brane / string gas cosmology @xcite , and the cyclic / ekpyrotic scenarios @xcite , all of which have the ultimate aim of becoming complete and testable models of the early universe .    a central question that arises in determining whether or not these models of the early universe reproduce observations is , how metric fluctuations in the presence of extra dimensions evolve in the backgrounds that these cosmologies propose .",
    "the importance of understanding this question can not be understated in the context of the abundance of available experimental data , against which we must compare our eventual predictions .",
    "for instance , in the ekpyrotic / cyclic scenario the effects of branes colliding in a 5-dimensional bulk are explored    key to the success of this program is being able to follow the evolution of metric fluctuations through the bounces of the extra dimension .",
    "the eventual goal of this is to be able to explain the observed inhomogeneities of the cosmic microwave background as being seeded by radion fluctuations generated through the motion of the branes towards each other , rather than through the quantum fluctuations of some putative inflaton field .",
    "similarly , in the context of the pre - big bang scenario , where an expanding and a contracting phase of the universe s evolution are naturally related to each other by the scale factor duality symmetry inherent to low energy effective string theory , a universe undergoing a big bang - big crunch transition is naturally implemented . in this context , the evolution of metric fluctuations through the bounce becomes a question of central importance in understanding the way the big bang phase of our universe s evolution happened the way it did . as it turns out ,",
    "although at first seemingly unrelated , an associated and as yet unexamined issue is how any tentative solution of the moduli problem will modify the spectrum of the metric fluctuations which we observe . given that the universe is likely to contain many extra dimensions whose shape and volume moduli are dynamical in the early universe , one might expect that the dynamics of these moduli fields will lead to a highly nontrivial modification of any initial pre - stabilization spectrum .",
    "it is the goal of this report to show that , in the context of a 5-d universe where an extra dimension undergoes non - singular bounces , or is en route to stabilization , the final spectrum for the bardeen potential corresponding to ( long wavelength ) fluctuations of the scale factor for the non - compact dimensions , is identical to the initial spectrum of the five - dimensional fluctuations ( in a sense which will be specified later ) .",
    "specifically , if we had an initial scale invariant spectrum for the five - dimensional fluctuations , we would end up with a scale invariant spectrum for the bardeen potential after the bounce , or after the transients of the stabilization had settled down .",
    "furthermore , we show that the variable corresponding to metric fluctuations of the compact dimensions decays , which corresponds to the stability of the radion degree of freedom to fluctuations in our non - singular setup .    one application of our work concerns the evolution of fluctuations in ekpyrotic / cyclic type models . in the context of a four space - time dimensional effective field theory toy model of this scenario",
    ", the dynamics of perturbations has been investigated in detail . the initial analyses @xcite yielded the result that a scale - invariant spectrum before the bounce transfers to a scale - invariant spectrum after the bounce .",
    "these analyses , however , were questioned in @xcite .",
    "a serious complicating factor turned out to be the fact that the proposed background evolution was singular , thus requiring the use of `` matching conditions '' ( such as those derived in @xcite in the context of an expanding cosmology undergoing a sudden phase transition ) to compute the post - bounce spectrum of fluctuations .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , there is a very sensitive dependence of the final result on the choice of the matching surface .",
    "independently , there has been recent work on the evolution of fluctuations through a nonsingular bounce in four space - time dimensional cosmologies , in which the bounce is constructed by adding extra terms to the standard lagrangian .",
    "these analyses @xcite yield results showing a sensitive dependence on the nature of the bounce .",
    "the bottom line of this work is that a correct analysis of fluctuations in the ekpyrotic / cyclic scenario needs to be done in a five space - time dimensional context , a context in which the nature of the bounce is unambiguous .",
    "a first important step in this direction was taken in @xcite , confirming the result that a scale - invariant spectrum passes through the bounce ( in the five - dimensional context , the bounce means that the radius of the extra spatial dimension bounces , not that the four space - time dimensional scale factor bounces ) without change in the spectral index .",
    "however , the analysis of @xcite was done in the context of a singular background and assuming specific matching conditions for fluctuations applied at a point when the perturbations in fact blow up .",
    "thus , the results are open to doubt . in this work ,",
    "we study the transfer of fluctuations through a cosmology in which two boundary branes approach each other and bounce without encountering a singularity ( see also @xcite for previous work done in the context of a particular nonsingular ekpyrotic - type bounce proposed in @xcite ) .",
    "we begin by introducing a non - singular bouncing model of a 5-dimensional universe where one dimension is compactified on a circle or an orbifold .",
    "as we shall see shortly in detail , our non - singular background is obtained by considering the effects of gas composed of massless string modes on the dynamics of space - time , in the context of a consistent low energy effective theory limit , or ` massless background ' , of string theory .",
    "we then set up the framework for studying cosmological perturbations in this model and study how these transfer through the various bounces that the extra dimension undertakes .",
    "although our setup is seemingly specific to string gas cosmology , the essence of our framework is that we have a non - singular bounce / stabilization mechanism that is affected by degrees of freedom that become massless at a certain point .",
    "hence , the hope is that the results obtained here can be generalized to other settings , an issue we will discuss in detail when we consider applications to different approaches to stringy cosmology .",
    "we now commence our paper with a few preliminaries .",
    "consider a five dimensional space - time with the topology of @xmath0 , described by the metric corresponds to cosmic time . ]",

    "the energy - momentum tensor for a string gas in this toroidally compactified background was derived in @xcite to which we refer the reader if any of what follows is unfamiliar .",
    "it was found to be @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the determinant of the metric , @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 being the inverse string tension ) and the subscripts @xmath16 refer to the momentum and winding quantum numbers of a closed string along the 5th dimension respectively , on which all of the subscripted quantities will depend .",
    "the density @xmath17 is the number density of the string gas with the metric dependence factored out ( @xmath18 ) , while @xmath19 is the energy of a single closed string in this background @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the center of mass momentum along the three non - compact directions , and @xmath22 is the number of right - moving string vibrational modes . for reasons made clear in @xcite and @xcite , string states that are massless at special symmetry points ( i.e. the self - dual radius ) should play a very distinguished role in any string gas cosmology ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "there are several reasons for this , among which are prominently the desire to obtain a viable late time phenomenology and a robust stabilization mechanism for the radion . however , the main motivation is that the low energy effective theory limits of string theory ( such as general relativity and dilaton gravity ) are also consistent backgrounds on which we can study the propagation of massless ( and only massless ) strings . for these reasons we do not further justify the focus on massless string modes , and refer the reader to @xcite for more details .",
    "for a general review of string gas cosmology , we refer the interested reader to @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "we wish to emphasize that the framework within which we chose to work assumes nothing other than the fact that nature is described by a string theory at high energies , and that the degrees of freedom that are likeliest to be excited ( namely massless string modes ) will be excited .",
    "the two particular geometries that we consider for the extra dimensions ( i.e. a toroidal geometry in this section and an orbifold geometry in the next section ) , are necessitated by the fact that they are the unique compact backgrounds on which one stays within the approximation of the low energy effective limit of string theory , when considering extra dimensions that are similar in size to the string scale .",
    "this is because in general , were the metric to depend on the extra dimension ( as is the case for warped extra dimensions ) , one will introduce curvatures that approach the string scale when the extra dimensions themselves approach the string scale , and hence the low energy approximation will break down .",
    "we discuss this point further in the next section .",
    "the particular states we are interested in are those for which @xmath23 . that these states are massless at the self - dual radius ( @xmath24 ) is easily checked from ( [ e ] ) .",
    "these states imply that ( [ b ] ) becomes @xmath25 we will see that this background stabilizes around the self - dual radius ( @xmath26 ) , whilst the non - compact directions persistently expand as they would in a radiation dominated universe .",
    "before we get to this , however , we wish to discuss a generalization of this background to the situation where the extra dimension is compactified on an orbifold .",
    "the consistency of the framework that we propose , namely that we remain within the low energy effective theory ( or massless background ) limit of string theory , requires the background we consider to satisfy the condition @xmath28",
    "\\ll \\frac{1}{\\alpha'}\\,.\\ ] ] that is , the ricci scalar should be considerably bounded from above by the string tension .",
    "this requirement translates into the statement that the metric should not change very much on the string scale , which ensures that this background remains a consistent background for the propagation of massless string modes .",
    "conversely , were one to consider backgrounds which do not satisfy ( [ approx ] ) , not only would the approximations made in deriving the low energy limit of string theory break down , one would also expect massive modes to be created @xcite . for our purposes",
    ", the requirement of ( [ approx ] ) means that were we to consider compactifications of the extra dimension on scales comparable to the self - dual radius , then there should be absolutely no dependence of the metric along the compactified direction .",
    "this is a remarkable feature of using a toroidal compactification : one can in fact study string scale processes without invalidating the approximations inherent in the low energy limit of string theory .",
    "it was shown in @xcite and @xcite that the background we are about to derive , does in fact satisfy ( [ approx ] ) throughout its dynamics .",
    "returning to the problem at hand , we see that since we are not allowed to consider metric dependencies along the extra dimension",
    "( by homogeneity and isotropy of the non - compact dimensions , the metric can then only depend on time ) , the components of the einstein tensor ( [ 00])-([55 ] ) are unchanged after orbifolding the extra dimension .",
    "the only place where orbifolding might make a difference is in the energy momentum tensor of the string gas .",
    "however , because the massless states that we have focused on are in the so - called untwisted sector @xcite ( in general , twisted states are localized at the orbifold fixed points ) , it turns out that there is no difference in the energy - momentum tensor either ( [ tt])-([aa ] ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the ` inheritance ' principle of orbifold theories @xcite , and permits us to use the framework just presented in either situation , provided we only use the modes that we have indicated and we do not consider any variations in any metric quantities along the extra dimension .",
    "however , there is a caveat to this in that two orbifold fixed planes are present , which might have matter confined to live on them .",
    "the requirement not to induce any metric variations along the extra dimension translates into , via the israel junction conditions @xcite , the condition ( among others ) @xmath29 \\propto 8\\pi g \\rho_{brane},\\ ] ] where @xmath30 $ ] is the jump of the derivative of the scale factor @xmath31 along the extra dimension , evaluated around either of the orbifold fixed planes .",
    "hence , we see that if we require there to be no dependence of the metric along the extra dimensions , then any matter localized on the branes must be sufficiently dilute to render the branes to behave as test branes .",
    "bearing all of this in mind , we can now proceed to derive the background solution within our framework .",
    "we first note from ( [ b ] ) that any form of matter which satisfies a radiative equation of state ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) for all times ( as opposed to our wound string states which become massless , hence radiative , only at the self - dual radius ) drops out of the driving term in the equation of motion for @xmath34 ( [ b ] ) .",
    "hence , we can safely consider a situation where we have a radiation gas in addition to our gas of wound strings , which dominates the evolution of the hubble factor @xmath35 for the non - compact dimensions through ( [ hc ] ) after the extra dimension has stabilized , or is close to stabilization .",
    "in fact , massless unwound closed string states ( gravitons : @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) can provide exactly such a bath . henceforth , it is natural to include such a bath in our setup .",
    "we do not consider this matter further , simply taking as a given in what follows that the scale factor @xmath31 for the non - compact dimensions expands at the background level as it would in a radiation dominated universe , that is @xmath38       the analytic approximation ( [ analyticb ] ) ( solid line ) is compared with the numeric solution of ( [ eom ] ) ( circles ) . ]",
    "let us go back to the equation of motion ( [ blah ] ) for @xmath39 , which reads @xmath40 where @xmath41 with @xmath42 is the center of mass momentum along the three large dimensions .",
    "introducing the characteristic time scale @xmath43 and defining the dimensionless time variable @xmath44 such that @xmath45 , we can simplify ( [ eomsubodh ] ) to @xmath46 where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath47 and we also introduced the free dimensionless parameter @xmath48 this equation can easily be integrated numerically , but it will turn out to be useful to have a simple analytic approximation .",
    "if we are close to the self - dual radius , that is @xmath49 with @xmath50 , we can expand the driving term in ( [ eom ] ) so that @xmath51 results .",
    "the general solution is given by @xmath52 with @xmath53 and @xmath54 constants .",
    "this solution may either describe the stabilization of the extra dimension or a series of non - singular bounces .",
    "is small . ]",
    "see fig.[fig : b_a_n ] for a comparison of the numeric solution of ( [ eom ] ) with the analytic one .",
    "since they are barely discernable we will use the analytic approximation in the following and switch freely between bounce / stabilization - language .",
    "we will first perturb the metric , focusing only on scalar metric perturbations . the most general scalar perturbation in `` generalized '' longitudinal gauge @xcite",

    "however , we can make an educated guess : if the universe underwent some phase of inflation in the three dimension before ( we will make this point more concrete in the next section ) , one should expect similar values for all metric perturbations ; hence we will set @xmath125 with some small @xmath126 . for simplicity , we will use @xmath127 for all @xmath128 . furthermore",
    ", since the long wavelength modes we are interested in should be frozen once they cross the hubble radius , we set @xmath129 the initial string density perturbation @xmath130 will be set to zero , because these massless modes just got produced .",
    "naturally , @xmath119 will get sourced by @xmath97 and @xmath96 .",
    "no conclusion in the following is sensitive to the chosen initial conditions , hence we chose the most simple ones above ( other ones were of course also tested ) .",
    "the only thing left to specify is the wave - number @xmath131 : we are interested in long wavelength modes , that is modes outside the hubble radius with small @xmath103 . in addition",
    ", we shall require @xmath132 , so that we can compare our results with ( [ analyticphi ] ) .",
    "with all initial conditions specified , we can use the analytic solution ( [ analyticb ] ) to solve ( [ eomgamma])-([eomrhoeta ] ) numerically .",
    "let us first compare @xmath133 for different values of @xmath103 , fig .",
    "[ fig : phi ] ( a)-(c ) : there @xmath105 is plotted both numerically ( grey ) and analytic ( black ) .",
    "we see that the analytic late time solution is approached pretty fast  in fact , the small difference at the beginning is not visible in this plot , but only if @xmath96 is plotted alone as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fields ] ( a ) .",
    "the visible decaying oscillation of @xmath105 is the decaying mode of @xmath97 form ( [ apprxgamma ] ) with frequency @xmath134 , which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fields ] ( b ) ( compare with fig .  [",
    "fig : phi ] ( b ) ) .",
    "in addition , there are strongly damped oscillations on top of the constant mode of @xmath96 , that carry the same frequency as @xmath135 , fig .",
    "[ fig : b ] . as mentioned before , these are not visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : phi ] but in fig .",
    "[ fig : fields ] ( a ) where @xmath96 is plotted alone .",
    "these oscillations are the impact of trapping the modulus @xmath39 , an impact that can safely be ignored in the long wavelength regime : if one decreases @xmath131 , all of these effects become less pronounced .    an other feature visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : phi ] is a bending of the lower curve in comparison to the analytic solution ( [ analyticphi ] ) .",
    "this bending is the beginning of an oscillation of @xmath96 and hence an expected feature , since the constant mode is actually the beginning of an oscillation with a very small frequency due to @xmath136 .",
    "all features are not sensitive to the initial values we choose for @xmath97 and @xmath96 .",
    "last but not least , @xmath119 is plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : fields ] ( c ) : it gets sourced quickly by @xmath97 and @xmath96 and oscillates with a nearly constant amplitude thereafter , with all frequencies entering . however , there is no mentionable back - reaction of @xmath119 on the metric perturbations .",
    "hence , one could give @xmath119 a non zero initial value without changing the evolution of @xmath97 and @xmath96 in any significant way .",
    "( a ) and ( b ) : @xmath39 over @xmath137 is plotted for @xmath138 , with the initial conditions given in section [ num ] .",

    "in the end , we are interested in the spectrum of @xmath105 .",
    "so far , there seems to be little to no impact of the transient stabilizing era of @xmath34 onto @xmath97 and @xmath96 .",
    "this translates directly to the spectrum , where @xmath105 should approach a horizontal line for small @xmath103 .",
    "this is indeed the case , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ( c ) , where the spectrum is evaluated at horizon crossing : the oscillations that are present for relatively large @xmath103 get damped once the long wavelength regime is approached .",
    "this is expected , because long wavelength modes enter the hubble radius later and henceforth , the decaying modes responsible for the oscillations in the spectrum get damped more .",
    "the frequency in the spectrum of @xmath105 is proportional to @xmath139 , in accordance with @xmath140 and equation ( [ analyticphi ] ) .",
    "note that no shift of the spectral index is induced , leaving the overall index unaltered . the oscillations in @xmath96 in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum](a ) are the main impact of the transient era of a dynamical @xmath34 .",
    "they are clearly negligible , because the tiny amplitude gets even smaller with decreasing @xmath103 .    to summarize",
    ", the main conclusion of our numerical study is that long wavelength metric perturbations quickly approach their asymptotic solution , leaving no trace of the many bounces @xmath34 experiences on its way to stabilization .",
    "more specifically , we have shown that the initial spectrum of the non - decaying mode of @xmath96 is preserved , i.e. equals the spectrum of @xmath96 at late times . at late times",
    ", the spectrum of @xmath96 equals the spectrum of the bardeen potential @xmath105 , the potential which is relevant for late time observations . speaking more loosely",
    ", we have shown that the initial pre - bounce spectrum of bulk perturbations is transferred to the late time cosmological perturbations without a change in the spectral index .",
    "@xmath113 is plotted for @xmath138 .",
    "this is the same plot as in fig.[fig : phi ] ( b ) , but with different initial conditions for @xmath39 : @xmath141 and @xmath142 are used instead of ( [ 63 ] ) and ( [ 64 ] ) .",
    "note that there is no discernable difference between this plot and fig.[fig : phi ] ( b ) . ]",
    "we saw in the previous section that there is no significant effect of trapping the modulus @xmath39 on the spectrum of long wavelength perturbations in the sense that the final spectrum of the bardeen potential @xmath143 equals the initial value of the non - decaying mode of the bulk perturbation @xmath82 .",
    "this comes about since the value of @xmath82 for small @xmath131 modes which have a wavelength larger than the hubble radius remains frozen during the phase of the trapping of @xmath39 , and since the final spectrum of @xmath82 coincides with the spectrum of @xmath143 .",
    "even though our result agrees with a `` naive '' intuition coming from the analysis of fluctuations in expanding four space - time dimensions , it could be viewed as an unexpected result : the `` naive '' intuition turned out to be wrong in the case of bouncing cosmologies in four space - time dimensions , for example in pre - big - bang models where it was shown @xcite that the growing mode of @xmath143 in the contracting phase couples almost exclusively to the decaying mode of @xmath143 in the expanding phase , leading to the result that there is a large change in the spectral index of the dominant mode between the contracting and the expanding phase .",
    "other analyses performed within the context of four - dimensional general relativity ( see @xcite and references therein ) yielded a similar result .",
    "it is now also generally accepted that the four space - time dimensional toy models which were proposed to describe the ekpyrotic / cyclic models have the same feature , namely that the dominant mode of @xmath143 in the contracting phase matches predominantly to the decaying mode of @xmath143 in the expanding phase ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our analysis , however , confirms the analysis of @xcite , which showed , in the context of a singular bounce , that in the case of a bounce of boundary branes in five space - time dimensions the spectrum of @xmath143 could be preserved .",
    "our result is an important step in constructing a viable alternative to standard scalar field - driven inflationary models ( next to the remarkable but highly nontrivial kklmmt construction , @xcite and follow - up papers ) in the context of cosmologies with extra dimensions .",
    "we will now outline two possible proposals which seem promising to us in that regard :    firstly , one could envisage a modification of the ekpyrotic / cyclic scenario . in the ekpyrotic proposal @xcite , a test brane moves slowly through the bulk towards the boundary brane of an orbifold ( the horava - witten @xcite setup ) . in the cyclic scenario @xcite , it is the two boundary branes that approach each other . in either case ,",
    "a scale - invariant spectrum of perturbations can be generated during the contracting phase given a suitable potential for the modulus field which describes the inter - brane distance @xcite . during the collision of the branes ( a singular event in the ekpyrotic / cyclic scenarios ) a hot universe",
    "is supposed to emerge on the boundary brane we live on today .",
    "our background construction can be viewed as a regularized version of the ekpyrotic / cyclic scenarios ( ekpyrotic in the context of a single bounce , cyclic in the case we consider the evolution until @xmath144 has stabilized ) .",
    "our work shows that in the context of such a regularized scenario , an initial scale - invariant spectrum could pass through the bounces and thus survive from the initial contracting phase to the final phase of expansion of our three spatial dimensions ( this scenario will be developed further in a follow - up paper ) . in our scenario ,",
    "the branes do not actually hit each other , but come to a halt as a consequence of the appearance of new massless modes that get produced explosively at a certain brane - separation ( that is at a certain value of @xmath34 ) .",
    "our results show that such dynamics does not spoil a scale invariant spectrum generated during the initial brane movement . in this framework",
    ", one can still reheat the universe , since the `` kinetic energy '' of the branes will get transferred to the stabilizing massless modes and other light modes which act like radiation on the brane ( corresponding to the radiation bath that we already included in our setup ) .",
    "secondly , an incorporation of inflation into brane / string gas cosmology will rely on the stabilization mechanism described in this article : if any mechanism of inflating three dimensions is found , the internal dimensions will most likely have to deflate in some way .",
    "for example , one could employ the idea of anisotropic inflation ( studied in the context of vacuum solutions of higher dimensional general relativity in @xcite and @xcite ) . once the internal dimensions get close to the self - dual radius , certain string modes become massless and get produced explosively along with a radiation bath , in close analogy to reheating after standard scalar field - driven inflation .",
    "these modes will then stabilize the internal dimensions , curing the graceful exit problem of anisotropic inflation , while the spectrum of fluctuations produced during inflation in the metric degrees of freedom remains unaltered .",
    "a concrete realization of this proposal is in preparation by the authors of this article .",
    "in this report , we studied how radion , matter and metric fluctuations interact in a universe that exhibits a transient stabilizing epoch of its extra dimension , which could also be viewed as a series of bounces of the extra dimension .",
    "we were primarily interested in the imprints of this epoch on the spectrum of the bardeen potentials , motivated by the hope of combining an earlier phase , generating a scale invariant spectrum ( e.g. in the framework of a modified ekpyrotic scenario , or via an incorporation of inflation within string gas cosmology ) , with a successful late time stabilizing mechanism , provided by a gas of massless string states .",
    "we found that the spectrum of long wavelength perturbations remains unaltered by this epoch , which has important consequences for various approaches to stringy models of the early universe .",
    "in particular , specific realizations of the ekpyrotic / cyclic scenario or an incorporation of inflation into string gas cosmology become possible  we provided two proposals in this report , but many variations are viable .    we would like to thank scott watson for helpful comments and discussions , and also andrei linde , diana battefeld and claudia de rahm for comments on the draft . t.b .",

    "in this appendix , we will provide arguments as to why no anisotropic stress arises in the setup of @xcite , which we examined at the perturbative level in this article . in the following @xmath145",
    "denote string world - sheet coordinates .    first note that our unperturbed background is undergoing frw expansion in the non - compact dimensions while the compact direction is stabilized at the self dual radius by a string gas . as a preliminary ,",
    "we wish to show that long wavelength perturbations of the metric do not affect the motion of strings to first order in the perturbation variables .",
    "we begin with the polyakov action for a closed string @xmath146 where we work in conformal gauge from the outset .",
    "consider now perturbations around the background : @xmath147 .",
    "it was shown in the appendix of @xcite how one can inherit the string spectrum and the constraint algebra provided the derivatives of the background metric @xmath148 ( i.e. the hubble factors ) are several orders of magnitude smaller than the string energy scales .",
    "we want to make sure that we stay within this regime while studying the dynamical compactification of the extra dimension .",
    "thus , when we consider the equations of motion for a closed string in this perturbed spacetime , we must neglect all derivatives of the unperturbed metric compared to the worldsheet derivatives of the string co - ordinates , as these will be of the order of the string scale whereas the metric derivatives are constrained to be much smaller @xcite .",
    "consider the equation of motion for a closed string @xmath149 from which follows @xmath150 now we expand @xmath151 as @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the solution to the unperturbed equation of motion @xmath154 , see appendix of @xcite .",
    "our perturbed equation of motion then becomes @xmath155 notice that there are two vastly different scales in the equation above : the worldsheet derivatives and the spacetime derivatives .",
    "if we imagine expanding @xmath156 in terms of fourier modes , the derivatives would bring down a factor of the 4-d wave - vector . realizing that we need to stay within the domain of validity of our setup , namely that we can not introduce fluctuations in the metric that would invalidate the conclusion in the appendix of @xcite concerning the string spectrum , we need these fluctuations to vanish on energy scales several orders of magnitude smaller than the string scale .",
    "this still allows for metric fluctuations that are considerably short distance in nature , but nevertheless above the string scale . with this in mind",
    ", we can neglect all the terms in ( [ perteom ] ) that are multiplied by derivatives of the metric perturbation , since these will be orders of magnitude smaller than the other ones .",
    "henceforth , we obtain the result @xmath157 that is , the string motion is unchanged by long wavelength perturbations .    ordinarily this would signal the end of any hopes to study perturbative physics ; this is not the case for us , since we are primarily interested in perturbing around a background which consists of a gas of such strings . as a result ,",
    "if we consider the perturbed energy - momentum tensor for such a gas , it will contain no anisotropic stress . to see this ,",
    "consider the off - diagonal spatial components which can be written as @xmath158 where @xmath159 and @xmath160 indicates an ensemble ( gas ) average .",
    "these components vanish , since we just determined that for individual strings @xmath161 , which means that there is no anisotropic stress to deal with in our setup .",

    "<S> in this report , we study within the context of general relativity with one extra dimension compactified either on a circle or an orbifold , how radion fluctuations interact with metric fluctuations in the three non - compact directions . </S>",
    "<S> the background is non - singular and can either describe an extra dimension on its way to stabilization , or immediately before and after a series of non - singular bounces . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the metric fluctuations transfer undisturbed through the bounces or through the transients of the pre - stabilization epoch . </S>",
    "<S> our background is obtained by considering the effects of a gas of massless string modes in the context of a consistent massless background ( or low energy effective theory ) limit of string theory . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss applications to various approaches to early universe cosmology , including the ekpyrotic / cyclic universe scenario and string gas cosmology . </S>"
