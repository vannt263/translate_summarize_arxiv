    "randomly crosslinked networks of polymer liquid crystal ( lcp ) materials ( liquid crystalline elastomers and gels ) have been a subject of substantial experimental and theoretical activity in recent years .",

    "three major factors determine the behavior of these remarkable materials : liquid crystalline symmetry breaking ; rubber elasticity coupled to the resulting anisotropy , producing a highly mobile principal axis ; and , finally , randomly placed ( and sometimes randomly oriented ) network crosslinks .",
    "random disorder introduced by these crosslinks encourages elastomers formed in the isotropic state to cool into polydomains , _",
    "i.e. _ highly non - uniform textures of their liquid crystalline phases .",
    "if the network is formed in the presence of an external field , or in a uniform monodomain low - temperature phase , the resulting elastomer remains macroscopically uniform .",
    "smectic elastomers ( refs .",
    "@xcite represent a few recent examples ) comprise liquid crystalline polymers crosslinked into a network which contains liquid crystalline groups ordered into a one - dimensional density wave , or a smectic state .",
    "one may consider either main chain or , more commonly , side - chain lcp s .",
    "the smectic order is typically obtained by forming the network in a smectic state ( _ e.g. _ by crosslinking at temperatures below the nematic ",
    "smectic-_a _ , or na , transition temperature @xmath1 in the melt ) .",
    "it can also be obtained by cooling a sample that has been prepared in the nematic state through the transition temperature @xmath2 , where we expect @xmath3 .",
    "the na transition in networks is expected to be qualitatively very different from the same transition in melts because of the presence of elastic strain degrees of freedom and the local effects of random crosslinks .    in the conventional na transition ,",
    "the degrees of freedom are the smectic order parameter @xmath4 and the director fluctuations @xmath5 .",

    "halperin , lubensky , and ma @xcite argued that the coupling to the fluctuating `` gauge '' field @xmath11 should induce a first order transition in type - i smectics ( and the analogous superconducting system ) . in type - i smectics",
    "the characteristic length for penetration of the director twist into the ordered smectic state is much smaller that the correlation length for the smectic order parameter , so that director fluctuations may be treated at a mean field level .",
    "type - ii smectics and superconductors , in which the gauge field fluctuations are correlated on length scales comparable or larger than that of the order parameter @xmath12 , require a more sophisticated analysis .",

    "toner @xcite has argued , on the basis of a dislocation - melting theory , that the transition should be continuous ; andereck and patton @xcite have calculated critical exponents within self - consistent perturbation theory ; and radzihovsky @xcite has performed a similar calculation for the analogous type - ii superconducting transition , demonstrating the existence of a fixed point not found in @xmath13-expansion of @xcite .    while our understanding of the na transition could be incomplete ,",
    "the nature of the smectic state is well - understood .",
    "the smectic one - dimensional density wave , of wave number @xmath14 , suffers the landau - peierls instability and the system exhibits quasi long ranged order ( with an algebraic decay of density correlations at long distances ) @xcite .",
    "the source of this instability is the goldstone modes corresponding to the arbitrary phase of the smectic density wave , whose long wavelength free energy is given by the landau - peierls elastic energy of a one - dimensional solid @xcite . in three dimensions",
    "this energy yields algebraic decay of correlations in the ordered state , analogous to systems with broken continuous symmetry in two dimensions .",
    "in contrast to a liquid crystalline melt , a liquid crystalline elastomer has an additional set of long - wavelength degrees of freedom : the elastic deformation @xmath15 , defined by the local network displacement , @xmath16 .",
    "smectic order couples to the elasticity through the crosslinks , and this coupling is manifested in two effects :    * crosslinks pin the smectic phase and break translational invariance .",
    "the mesogens are either incorporated into the polymer backbone ( main chain lcp s ) or tethered to the network ( side chain lcp s ) , and the stretching energy for relative translations between elastic displacements of the crosslinks @xmath17 along the direction of the smectic density wave and the layer displacement @xmath18 can be written phenomenologically as @xcite @xmath19 ^ 2 .",

    "this coupling restores the bragg peaks associated with smectic order @xcite . in section",

    "* however , in the special case where the nematic elastomer possesses _ soft elasticity _ ( see eq .  [ eq : csoft ] below ) , characteristic of spontaneously breaking the symmetry from the isotropic to nematic states @xcite , elastic strain fluctuations [ the phonons @xmath15 ] restore the hlm effect and the concomitant first order phase transition . *",
    "if the nematic state is field - induced rather than spontaneous ( _ i.e. _ the network has been formed to record the broken orientational symmetry ) , the corresponding network phonon modes are conventional and the type - i na transition should be continuous .",
    "we predict a tri - critical point in the crossover region between these two regimes . *",
    "the effect of disorder on the na transition is a simple renormalization of the transition temperature @xmath27 .",
    "the transition temperature _ increases _ because crosslinks localize the smectic phase variable and encourage order in the disordered phase . however , slightly below @xmath27 the smectic state crosses over to a ` glassy ' state characterized by replica  symmetry - breaking .",
    "* we emphasize that the typical nematic or smectic network is most likely to be ` hard ' , and that the ` soft ' case we discuss extensively here is , for most practical cases , a theoretical construct which provides a framework for understanding the implications of a smectic state coupled to an underlying elastic continuum .",
    "our description of the na transition in the network is mesoscopic because we treat the smectic and director degrees of freedom as smoothly varying fields while including the microscopic interaction of the crosslinks with the smectic order parameter .",
    "the calculation in this paper sets up the proper coarse - grained model with which to investigate the effects of disorder on the smectic network , which we discuss briefly here and in more detail in a forthcoming work .",
    "the coarse - grained nematic and smectic fields are defined on a length @xmath28 of order a correlation length for liquid - crystalline fluctuations , while the elastic strain field is coarse - grained on lengths down to the mesh size @xmath29 in the network , which may be larger than @xmath30 .",
    "these different lengthscales must be kept in mind throughout .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  ii we present a more detailed discussion of the two primary effects of the network - smectic couplings ; in section  iii we present the model free energy for the system ; in section  iv we sketch the integration of the elastic strain and director fluctuations and present an effective free energy for the smectic in the presence of disorder ; and we conclude in section  v. our primary results are the effective landau energies at the end of section  iv and the discussion in section  ii about the smectic - elastic couplings . our goal here is to understand the various terms in the hamiltonian describing the na transition , and identify the effects of disorder and rubber elasticity on the instability to the smectic state .",

    "let us focus on side - chain lcp s , fig .  1",
    ", since these constitute the most commonly synthesized liquid crystalline elastomers .",
    "the three constituents of the elastomer are flexible backbone monomers , crosslink groups , and mesogenic side - groups attached to the backbone with flexible spacers . in elastomers (",
    "as opposed to tough and brittle densely - crosslinked resins ) the volume fraction of crosslinks is much smaller than that of the backbone and mesogenic groups , typically less than a percent of the aggregate .",
    "hence we treat the environment of the mesogens as a uniform mesogen / backbone mixture with _ interspersed _ crosslink groups .",
    "= 3truein    it is reasonable to expect a steric repulsion between the mesogen and the crosslink which is enhanced relative to the steric repulsion between the backbone and the mesogen , simply because four chains come together at the crosslink .",
    "the presence of a flory-@xmath31 parameter between the mesogen and backbone groups contributes a similar effect . while there will also be an interaction with the local nematic order , since the mesogens may adopt an alignment dictated by the crosslink , we concentrate in this work on the effects of disorder on a smectic phase appearing out of a uniform conventional nematic state . hence , we model the crosslinks by a local random field which induces smectic order and fixes the smectic phase , leading to eq .",

    "the barrier for such an object to ` tunnel ' through a smectic smectic layer is a molecular characteristic of the material describing the degree of miscibility of backbone and the mesogenic side - groups , and is roughly of order @xmath37 , where @xmath31 is the the flory-@xmath31 parameter between mesogens and backbone , which includes both steric and energetic interactions .    introducing the continuum crosslink density @xmath38 , so that under an elastic distortion @xmath39 they distort by @xmath40 , we can transform ( [ eq : fxlsum ] ) to collective variables . after changing variables",

    "the characteristic moments are @xmath45  and @xmath46 .",
    "one should note , at this point , that a different situation emerges for a network formed in a deep uniform smectic phase : the polymer backbone in such a system is highly constrained between the smectic layers and , therefore , the crosslink distribution ( [ eq : pc ] ) has a positionally modulated kernel . this possibility will have a profound effect on the phase ordering in the smectic phase , but is not relevant for the na transition description we are concerned here . also , in a physical system crosslinks fluctuate about their mean positions @xcite , which broadens the kernel of eq.([eq : pc ] ) into a gaussian distribution with a width ( in real space ) proportional to the extent of the typical crosslink fluctuation .",
    "we ignore such fluctuation effects for now .",
    "the second effect of the network on the smectic phase is due to stretching the polymer backbone .",
    "this leads to a free energy cost for uniformly displacing the smectic phase relative to the elastic displacement , given by eq.([eq : new ] ) @xcite .",
    "whereas the contribution of the previous sub - section acts only at the crosslink position , the stretching effect influences the smectic phase all along the strand between crosslinks , and is coarse - grained at the mesh size or larger . to understand this in detail we first note the distinction between the smectic phase variable @xmath47 and the @xmath48-displacement @xmath49 of the center - of - mass of the @xmath50 smectic mesogen .",
    "the phase @xmath47 is a coarse - grained variable and the displacements @xmath51 are microscopic variables . to calculate the position of the smectic phase from a microscopic picture one must",
    ", in principle , average over all the positions of the mesogens . in an equilibrium smectic _ liquid _ the mesogens lie in a smectic potential given by , for example , a cosine modulation @xcite , but",
    "are not fixed in one trough of this potential : rather , they fluctuate back and forth over the barriers . in a strongly - ordered smectic state",
    "the activation over the barriers is very rare , while in a weak smectic state these fluctuations are quite common .",
    "the ` motion ' of the smectic phase thus corresponds to the average motion of the mesogens centers - of - mass .",
    "now consider an elastomer in a smectic state and imagine displacing the smectic phase while fixing the crosslink positions .",
    "for clarity we focus on a side - chain liquid crystalline network , but the argument applies to a main - chain network as well .",
    "the displacement of the smectic phase displaces the average positions @xmath51 of the mesogenic sidegroups .",
    "since these are tethered to the polymer backbone , this costs roughly the entropy of displacing the center - of - mass of a polymer chain a distance @xmath52 while keeping the endpoints ( _ i.e. _ crosslink positions ) fixed .",
    "a simple calculation leads to an energy per chain of @xmath53 , with @xmath54 the number of monomers of size @xmath55 between crosslinks .",
    "in addition to this elastic force , an individual mesogen feels a force due to the smectic potential @xcite . at zero temperature",
    "this potential enforces the separation of the smectic phase variable and the crosslink displacement , but at finite temperature this barrier may be overcome by hopping . by hopping we mean that the mesogen flips from one smectic trough to another , in such a way as to relax the strain .",
    "this allows the smectic phase variable to increase without bound while roughly localizing the mesogens centers - of - mass .",
    "hence a timescale @xmath56 separates liquid - like smectic behavior at long times from ` solid - like ' smectic behavior at short times , the latter characterized by the elastic modulus @xmath57 . for temperatures above the nematic - smectic transition temperature @xmath56",
    "is extremely small and we may ignore this elastic effect .",
    "however , as the network is cooled deep into the smectic state @xmath56 grows , and for all practical purposes we must include this term . since we are only concerned here with very weak smectic phases in this work , we leave further discussion of the interesting dynamics of a smectic network to another work .",

    "this term becomes very large and the expansion is only relevant for extremely small @xmath102 . at the point where the expansion becomes invalid",

    "thus , for small enough @xmath139 the transition is expected to be of first order .",

    "the _ only _ effect of disorder is to slightly increase the transition temperature , which is sensible because crosslink sites locally enhance the smectic order .",
    "our effective free energy assumes a replica - symmetric ground state . in the appendix",
    "we note that the replica - symmetric solution is stable for @xmath158 , while in the smectic state there is a crossover at small @xmath102 to a replica  non - symmetric state , which in this context refers to the effect of the smectic order on the background phonon spectrum .",
    "an analysis of the further effects of disorder on the low temperature state is beyond this scope of this work .",
    "we conclude by first discussing some experimental consequences and signatures of this work .",
    "the primary qualitative prediction concerns the order of the transition .",
    "the preparation of networks of varying degrees of ` softness ' ( which may be controlled by , for example , changing the degree of order which is frozen into the smectic state ) allow for tests of the predicted tricritical behavior between first- and second - order nematic ",
    "_ transitions , which may be probed by , for example , specific heat experiments .",
    "it would also be interesting to test the crossover to a ` glassy ' phase characterized by replica - symmetry breaking .",

    "a cornerstone of our treatment involves the coupling between the smectic phase variable and the elastic strain , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : new ] ) , which we have asserted to be a dynamic effect .",
    "a signature of this would be a characteristic timescale @xmath56 associated with hopping of mesogens over the smectic barrier . in strong smectic phases this timescale should be essentially infinite so that we may use eq .",
    "( [ eq : new ] ) , but it should be present in weak smectics and emerge in measurements of the complex rheological response function .      in this work we have examined the onset of the nematic ",
    "smectic - a transition in a smectic elastomer , and delineated two types of behavior ( summarized in the free energies , eqs .",
    "[ eq : flandboth ] ) .",
    "soft nematic elastomers should display a first order transition , due to the hlm effect induced by the spectrum of goldstone modes which are a combination of director and strain fluctuations .",
    "conventional ` hard ' elastomers , on the other hand , should have a continuous transition , with a tricritical point as the soft limit is approached .",
    "in performing our calculations we have assumed the system is in the type - i limit , so that a mean field treatment is valid .",
    "since director fluctuations have an additional mass due to the coupling to the elastic network , we believe this limit is safe for smectic elastomers . we have treated disorder within the replica formalism and found that , at the level of the onset of the transition , the only effect is to stabilize the smectic state .",
    "a preliminary analysis suggests that the effects of disorder are certainly important deep in the smectic state .",
    "hence a natural extension of this work concerns the nature of the low temperature phase .",
    "the effects of disorder are two - fold : ( 1 ) translational symmetry is broken and the smectic phase is locally pinned to the disorder , which should destroy the landau - peierls transition in favor of true long - range order of the smectic density wave ; and ( 2 ) disorder can be strong enough to destroy the long - range order itself . which , if either , of these effects wins out is an interesting question , analogous to the effects of disorder on other systems with continuous symmetry , such as the xy - model or flux lattices in superconductors .    a second , more speculative",
    ", result of our work is the suggestion that the coupling proposed previously to describe the energy penalty for sliding the smectic phase relative to the crosslinks , eq .",
    "( [ eq : new ] ) , is actually present only when one considers sufficiently short timescales ( which , practically , may still be of order of years ) .",
    "this leads to predictions of rheological effects , as well as possible glassy phases to ` freeze ' this term in , which we leave for the future .",
    "this interesting suggestion is based on the notion that the smectic layers are actually ` phantom ' layers , and their motion need not correspond with center - of - mass motion of the mesogens .",
    "we are grateful to d.  khmelnitskii , t.  lubensky , and m.  warner for helpful conversations .",
    "this work has been supported by unilever - plc ( emt ) and the epsrc ( pdo ) .",
    "in this appendix we sketch the steps to integrate the network phonon field @xmath15 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : zrep1 ] ) . recall first our coordinate system @xmath159 , as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : geometry ] ) .",
    "we begin with the energy governing the elastic degrees of freedom , eq .",
    "( [ eq : qualreplh ] ) , after integrating out the director degrees of freedom : @xmath160 where the matrix @xmath161 is given by @xmath162 where @xmath163 and the new renormalized elastic moduli are @xmath164 recall that @xmath165 is the deviation from an ideal soft nematic elastomer @xcite .    we first rescale @xmath129 , pulling out the determinant of @xmath166 , which leaves the following replica partition function : @xmath167 where @xmath168\\right\\}\\ ] ] note that the matrix @xmath169 becomes a differential operator in real space , with the square root defined with reference to the operator in fourier space .    to calculate @xmath170 we use the gaussian variational method ( gvm ) @xcite .",
    "since this method is well - known and is essentially the hartree approximation , we sketch the procedure and refer the reader to references @xcite for further discussion .",
    "we begin by assuming a trial hamiltonian , @xmath171 the free energy for the @xmath172 integration satisfies the inequality @xmath173 where the average is taken with the trial hamiltonian @xmath174 .",
    "the variational free energy @xmath175 , which must then be minimized over the matrix @xmath176 , is @xmath177 -\\gamma\\sum_{a , b}\\int\\!d^3\\!r      next we calculate the self - consistency conditions @xmath180 . for a replica - symmetric ansatz , @xmath181 ,",
    "the self - consistency conditions yield @xmath182 and @xmath183 in obtaining this relation we have assumed that the the smectic instability is satisfactorily described by a replica - symmetric ansatz @xmath184 .",
    "henceforth we discard free energies terms of higher than linear order than @xmath88 , which vanish in the @xmath185 limit .",
    "moreover , we expect that in the low temperature phase @xmath186 is replica - symmetric , and glassy behavior manifests itself in broken replica symmetry of the phase variable [ _ i.e. _ the layer spacing @xmath18 ] as in , for example , the @xmath188-model in a random field @xcite .",
    "next we identify the free energy using eq .",
    "( [ eq : replicatrick ] ) , and examine the stability of the nematic phase against uniform smectic order .",
    "hence we examine the stability of @xmath189 .",
    "the final result is : @xmath190    there are four @xmath126-integrals to perform : one ( @xmath191 ) from @xmath192 , which arises from director fluctuations and from the logarithm of the prefactor of the determinant of @xmath193 . these are identical , and exhibit a partial cancellation [ a factor of @xmath194 from the director fluctuations and a factor of @xmath195 from the determinant of @xmath193 ] ; two more integrals ( @xmath197 and @xmath198 ) emerge from @xmath199 , and one from ( @xmath200 ) @xmath201 , which enters in the exponential in @xmath202 .",
    "@xmath191 may be performed exactly and expanded to yield even powers of @xmath92 .",
    "we take @xmath197 to be the integral of the logarithm of the single diagonal of @xmath193 involving @xmath203 ( that is , @xmath204 ) .",
    "this has a contribution non - analytic in @xmath92 for @xmath205 , since in this case @xmath206 and the integrand in the @xmath115-integral is singular as @xmath207 .",
    "this yields the cubic term @xmath208 , as well as many terms even in @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath198 is then the logarithm of the determinant of the remaining @xmath209 sector of @xmath193 .",
    "this is also non - analytic in @xmath92 at @xmath85 , but yields terms of order @xmath210 , _ etc _ , which we ignore compared to the effect of @xmath211 contribution ( these terms can be shown to lead to subdominant terms for small @xmath139 ) .    the last integral , appearing in @xmath212 , must be handled with care .",
    "we are interested in expanding this integral for small @xmath92 for both the soft ( @xmath85 ) and hard ( @xmath144 ) cases . for @xmath213",
    "the integrand is singular as @xmath207 .",
    "this singularity yields a logarithmic contribution to the integral , so we write @xmath214 is an analytic function of @xmath92 . hence the term involving @xmath202 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fpsibig ] ) contributes a term in the energy proportional to @xmath215 , multiplied by an exponentially small prefactor .",
    "we find @xmath216 to be essentially the caill exponent @xcite , @xmath217 , where @xmath218 is a combination of rubber elastic constants .",
    "since @xmath216 may be of order @xmath219 , we ignore this term compared to the cubic term .",
    "if @xmath216 is sufficiently small we may include this term in a landau expansion , but we expect the exponentially small prefactor to render it negligible . in the case where @xmath139 is non - zero",
    "the integral is analytic and yields even powers of @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , the only qualitative effect of disorder is to _ increase _ the transition temperature .",
    "the final step of the calculation is to ensure stability of the replica - symmetric ansatz for the @xmath129 integral .",
    "this is done by examining the replicon mode , identified for the gvm as @xcite @xmath220 where @xmath103 is the eigenvalue of the most unstable fluctuation mode about the replica - symmetric solution given by ( @xmath221 ) .",
    "we note that this is actually the eigenvalue of the fluctuation mode of the @xmath222 limit version of the theory , where @xmath223 is the number of ` color ' components of the field @xmath129 , in which limit the gvm ( or hartree ) approximation becomes the exact saddle point integral @xcite . while @xmath103 is calculated in this limit , it may or may not apply to the physical case @xmath224 , but hopefully yields intuition about the correct behavior .    since @xmath225 in the high - temperature phase ( because @xmath158 ) , the replica - symmetric solution is stable as far as understanding the onset of the smectic transition .",
    "analysis reveals an @xmath226-divergence in @xmath227 . which indicates a critical temperature ( in the smectic state ) at which the disorder is relevant and we must consider replica  non - symmetric states .",
    "here @xmath226 is the system dimension . ignoring numerical factors , this ` glass ' transition temperature @xmath228",
    "is given by the temperature very slightly below the na transition at which the order parameter attains the value @xmath229 , given by @xmath230 where @xmath231 is a combination of rubber elastic constants .",
    "since @xmath229 is inversely proportional to the system dimension @xmath226 , the window within which the replica - symmetric solution holds is expected to be very small .",
    "thus , for understanding the properties of realistic systems , one must examine the properties of the disordered low temperature state within the framework of replica  symmetry - breaking ."
