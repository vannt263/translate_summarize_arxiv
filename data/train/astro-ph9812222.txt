    "the epoch of formation of elliptical galaxies remains a fundamental and controversial issue in cosmology . while observations show that at least some galaxies were already in place at redshifts @xmath1 ( dunlop et al .",
    "1996 ; franx et al .",
    "1997 ; dey et al .",
    "1998 ; hu et al . 1998 ) , other recent data ( zepf 1997 ; abraham et al . 1998 ; glazebrook et al . 1998 ; kauffman & charlot 1998 ) have been interpreted as indicative of a general formation epoch at @xmath2 . in hierarchical models of galaxy formation dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) ,",
    "elliptical galaxies arise from the merging at low redshift of intermediate mass disks ( e.g. kauffmann , charlot & white 1996 ; baugh , cole & frenk 1996 ) .",
    "in contrast , in isocurvature cdm ( peebles 1998 ) ( icdm ) , or warm dark matter ( colombi , dodelson & widrow 1995 ) ( wdm ) models , ellipticals are assembled at @xmath3 in a major single collapse event .",
    "zepf ( 1997 ) and barger et al .",
    "1998 have recently argued that such models can be rejected because they predict large numbers of very red galaxies at intermediate redshifts which are not seen in deep optical - infrared surveys .",
    "however , this conclusion maybe premature since , while detailed predictions ( e.g. baugh , cole & frenk 1996 ) have been made for hierarchical cdm models , only very simplistic models have been used to study the evolution of galaxies in icdm or wdm models . in particular the physically unrealistic ` one - zone ' model ( baade 1957 ; arimoto & yoshii 1987 ; matteucci & tornambe 1987 ) ( or monolithic model ) , in which elliptical galaxies are formed in a single @xmath4-yr starburst predicts very red colours at all intermediate redshifts ( zepf 1997 ; barger et al .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore a more realistic multi - zone chemo - dynamical single - collapse model for predicting the colours of high - redshift elliptical galaxies .",
    "we have used the chemo - dynamical code developed by friaa & terlevich ( 1998 ) to compute a single collapse multi - zone model in which a single massive dark halo hosts baryonic gas that will fall into the center of the dark potential and will subsequently form stars .",
    "the code assumes spherical symmetry and thus uses a 1d hydro - dynamical solver that calculates the hydro - dynamical evolution and radial behaviour of the ism and stars during the early collapse and evolution of the elliptical galaxy .",
    "the galaxy is divided into 100 zones from the core up to the tidal radius .",
    "we assume that the specific star formation rate ( sf ) follows a power - law function of gas density ( @xmath5 ) ; @xmath6 ( here @xmath7 gyr@xmath8 , @xmath9 is the initial average gas density inside the core radius of the dark halo , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the spatial and time coordinates respectively ) .",
    "we have also included inhibition of star formation by inefficient gas cooling and expanding gas .",
    "a characteristic feature of these models is that several episodes of inflow and outflow occur simultaneously at different radii ( friaa & terlevich 1998 ) . the detailed behaviour of these models of course depends on the precise parameters chosen .",
    "although we will show here results for specific cases , we believe that the critical feature is robust : the global star formation history in the galaxy naturally extends over a period of about 1 gyr .    using the resulting distribution of the gas flow , the equations of chemical evolution",
    "are then solved .",
    "once the structure of the ism and the chemical abundances in each of the 100 zones have been computed , we use the spectral - synthesis code developed by jimenez et al .",
    "( 1998 ; 1999 ) to compute the spectral energy distributions of the multi - zone model at different radii and ages .",
    "our models constitute a realistic family which successfully account for several observational properties of elliptical galaxies ( jimenez et al .",
    "1999 , in preparation ) : ( 1 ) the observed metallicity gradients are naturally reproduced  the core has super - solar metallicity and the outer regions have sub - solar metallicities ; ( 2 ) the [ @xmath12/fe ] ratio is supersolar in the core of the galaxy , and also when averaged over the whole galaxy ; ( 3 ) the observed positive mass - metallicity relation is reproduced ; ( 4 ) galactic winds from elliptical galaxies can explain the amount of iron in the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) of rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "the time scales for chemical enrichment are also consistent with the observations .",
    "for example , the high - metallicity core is formed quickly enough to explain the strong metal lines observed in @xmath13 qsos ( assuming that a young elliptical core hosts the qso event ) , and the icm is enriched rapidly enough to account for the lack of evolution of the icm fe abundance in rich galaxy clusters ( mushotzky & loewenstein 1997 ) up to @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , our multi - zone model does not display the extremely high luminosities ( @xmath15 up to @xmath16 l@xmath17 ) of the one - zone models , which have never been observed ( friaa & terlevich 1998 ) .",
    "furthermore the model reproduces the observed spectral ages of red elliptical galaxies found at intermediate redshifts ( dunlop et al .",
    "one of the firm predictions of our model is that star formation in elliptical galaxies lasts longer than @xmath18 years . in the top panel of fig .  1 we show the star formation rate in @xmath19 @xmath20 for three different galaxy masses . in general our",
    "elliptical galaxy model exhibits three star - formation stages : stage ( 1 ) during which the bulk of the stellar population is formed ( half of the present day stellar population inside 10 kpc is formed in 0.42 , 0.40 and 0.30 gyr for the galaxies with @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 m@xmath17 , respectively ) ; the duration of this stage is well traced by the early , major peak , in the evolution of the star formation rate ( see fig .  1 top panel ) ; stage ( 2 ) , which corresponds to a extended period of star formation in the core ( 2 - 3 gyr ) as a result of the inner cooling flow .",
    "this episode has more modest star - formation rates than stage ( 1 ) and explains the blue colours of our model and thus the absence of passively evolving elliptical galaxies in deep optical and near - infrared surveys as claimed by zepf ( 1997 ) and .",
    "finally , after stage ( 2 ) is finished , our model evolves _",
    "passively_. however , very massive galaxies retain the inner ( like e.g. cd galaxies in the center of clusters ) cooling flow until the present epoch , which results in the occurrence of subsequent low - level bursts of star formation . for the intermediate mass galaxy the sf peaks at about 100 @xmath19 @xmath20 .",
    "on the other hand , the most massive galaxies exhibit much higher maximum star - formation rates , typically several hundred @xmath24 .",
    "such a maximum star - formation rate is an order of magnitude smaller than that predicted by the one - zone model ( @xmath25 ) , and is comparable to the maximum sf rates inferred for massive galaxies at @xmath26 from sub - millimetre observations ( dunlop et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "a recognized strength of the one - zone model is that a relatively short - lived burst of star formation seems to be required to avoid substantial contamination of the stellar population by fe ejected into the ism by supernovae snia ( most of which explode after several @xmath18 years ) , which makes it hard to reproduce the observed super - solar [ @xmath12/fe ] abundances ( where the @xmath12 elements are : o , ne , mg , si , s , ar and ca ) in elliptical galaxies .",
    "conversely , a problem in the hierarchical picture is that , due to the extended period over which significant star formation occurs , the resulting models of elliptical galaxies struggle to exhibit super - solar @xmath27/fe@xmath28 $ ] ratios , but rather tend towards the solar ratio due to snia contamination of the ism . since our multi - zone model has a somewhat more extended period of star formation ( fig .  1 top panel )",
    "than the one - zone model , it might be expected that contamination by snia would also prevent the multi - zone models from reproducing the observed @xmath27/fe@xmath28 $ ] ratios .",
    "in fact this is not the case . in fig .",
    "1 ( bottom panel ) we show the time - evolution of @xmath27/fe@xmath28 $ ] for two different masses and two radii . as expected , the predicted @xmath29 $ ] ratios are initially very high due to the fact that sn ii s dominate the chemical enrichment in the early evolution of the galaxy .",
    "then , as later sni explosions enrich the ism with fe , the average @xmath30 $ ] of formed stars decreases , but the star formation is actually switched off early enough to fix the @xmath30 $ ] at super - solar values and it remains so until the present epoch .",
    "the reason for this is that the snia rate peaks during the late stage of continuing star formation ( the maximum of the snia rate occurs at 0.85 , 0.75 , and 1.8 gyr for the models with @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 m@xmath17 , respectively ) , and by that time most of the stellar mass of the galaxy has been formed ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "therefore , the resulting galaxies still exhibit super - solar @xmath27/fe@xmath28 $ ] ratios .",
    "the consequence of the relatively extended sf history in this model is that elliptical galaxies do not become extremely red .",
    "2 shows the redshift evolution of @xmath32 for three different galaxy masses and two alternative cosmological scenarios : an einstein - de sitter universe ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) and a vacuum - energy dominated universe ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) .",
    "these two example cosmologies have been chosen because they represent extreme cases of a young and an old universe . in both cases",
    "we have adopted a value for the hubble constant of 65 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 . in what follows",
    "we assume that all dark haloes collapse at a given redshift and then investigate whether , as the resulting galaxies evolve , they ever display observed optical - infrared colours redder than the limit considered by zepf ( 1997 ) for the monolithic model , which translates into @xmath37 . for simplicity two formation redshifts",
    "are considered : @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "note that at @xmath40 the observed colours of galaxies determined by aperture photometry are usually roughly equivalent to their integrated colours , i.e. including the whole visible radius .",
    "2 shows that , even assuming a formation redshift of @xmath41 , the multi - zone model never produces colours as red as @xmath42 .",
    "indeed it is only for the most massive galaxy model that a colour as red as @xmath43 is ever achieved , and that requires the assistance of a very high formation redshift in an old ( in this example @xmath44-dominated ) universe .",
    "thus , integrated within a radius of 10 kpc , the maximum @xmath32 colour predicted by our multi - zone models is typically @xmath45 , comparable with the observed colours of the reddest known ellipticals at @xmath46 .",
    "of course the maximum predicted colour is still bluer if a lower redshift of formation is assumed , and if @xmath47 , the maximum predicted colour peaks at @xmath48 between @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "it is thus clear that even if _ all _ elliptical galaxies were to start forming stars at @xmath38 , they would never become as red as the one - zone model would predict .",
    "there is one and only reason for this : the extended period of star formation in the multi - zone model .",
    "note that these blue colours are _ independent _ of the suite of spectrophotometric models chosen to compute them , since the effect of choosing different codes will be at the most 0.3 magnitudes ( see e.g. jimenez et al .",
    "1999 ) , totally irrelevant for the present discussion .",
    "in other words , small differences in rest frame colours have no effect in observed colours . a direct comparison with the observed data collected by zepf ( 1997 ) on the abundance of faint red galaxies is shown in fig .  3 .",
    "the top two panels show that the multi - zone model predicts _ zero _ galaxies with @xmath51 , in superb agreement with the observations .",
    "an even more robust prediction of the multi - zone model is that the space density of galaxies with @xmath52 ( two magnitudes below the colour cut - off chosen by zepf(1997 ) ) will be smaller than five galaxies per arcmin@xmath53 again in superb agreement with the data .",
    "finally , we consider the star - formation rates estimated from the single collapse multi - zone model in the context of the cosmological evolution of global star formation rate in the universe .",
    "several authors have recently attempted to determine the global level of star formation in the universe at redshifts higher than two ( pei & fall 1995 ; dunlop 1998 ; pettini et al .",
    "1998 ; hughes et al . 1998 ) ; the main uncertainty in this case is the precise impact of dust at high redshift . to predict the star - formation density contributed at high redshift by young ellipticals from the single collapse multi - zone model , we have assumed that the number density of massive ellipticals at high  redshift is the same as at the present  day ( terlevich & boyle 1993 ) , and that they all collapse at the same redshift .",
    "therefore we adopt a schechter luminosity function given by @xmath54 $ ] with @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 with the same power law extension for @xmath58 adopted in friaa & terlevich ( 1998 ) . integrating this luminosity function for galaxies brighter than @xmath59 ,",
    "it is possible to predict the global star - formation density of the universe at any redshift using our multi - zone models for different galaxy masses .",
    "4 shows , for an einstein - de sitter cosmology , and two different formation redshifts ( @xmath60 ; solid curve , and @xmath61 ; dashed curve ) , the predicted contribution of young ellipticals to the global star - formation density at high  redshift . for comparison , we also show several observational indicators of the cosmological evolution of star - formation density , derived from lyman - limit galaxies in the hdf ( pettini et al .",
    "1998 ) , from recent deep sub - millimetre surveys ( hughes et al . 1998 ) , from the cosmological evolution of luminosity density from radio  sources ( dunlop 1998 ) , and from the chemical evolution of metals in the universe ( pei & fall 1995 ) .",
    "4 demonstrates that our models do not conflict with the existing data , and other external indicators of star - formation density at high redshift .",
    "even galaxy formation redshifts as high as 6 appear perfectly consistent with the available data . note that we have used an extreme case in which _ all _ galaxies form at the same redshift .",
    "if elliptical galaxies form over a redshift range between 3 and 10 with a small fraction of them being formed at redshift higher than 6 , then there would be even room to form bulges of spirals at a high redshift .",
    "we conclude by re - emphasizing that the hierarchical picture and the multi - zone model considered here both predict a complete absence of objects with colours as red as @xmath62 in deep optical and near - infrared surveys ( unless , of course , the intrinsic colours of the galaxy in question are heavily distorted by dust ) .",
    "furthermore the multi - zone model does display some late episodes of low - level star formation that could account for the observed properties of some elliptical galaxies ( abraham et al .",
    "1998 ; glazebrook et al . 1998 ) in the hdf which appear to show evidence of some recent star - forming activity and it does not seem implausible that field and cluster ellipticals may follow a different evolutionary path .",
    "however , in the multi - zone model considered here , @xmath63% of the final stellar population of the final elliptical galaxy is formed during the first gyr of its evolution .",
    "this provides a natural explanation for the homogeneous properties displayed by present - day elliptical galaxies , without violating the colour limits derived by zepf ( 1997 ) at intermediate redshifts .",
    "the lack of very red galaxies at high redshifts is therefore not a strong test of hierarchical structure formation .",
    "better probes of such theories come either from the homogeneity of the colour  magnitude relation ( bower , kodama & terlevich 1998 ) , or from a direct counting of luminous galaxies at high redshifts . at present",
    ", there is some evidence that the galaxy population was not created in its entirety at very high redshifts ( kauffmann & charlot 1998 ) , but single - collapse models for the spheroidal population can not yet be ruled out ( e.g. totani & yoshii 1998 ) .",
    "larger complete samples with hst morphologies will be needed before we can claim to have observed merging at work in modifying the galaxy population .",
