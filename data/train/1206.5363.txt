    "graphene , a single atomic layer of graphite , has attracted a great amount of attention because of its fundamental interest and promising applications @xcite .",
    "one of the remarkable properties of pristine graphene is the linear dispersion relation of its electronic spectrum near the dirac point @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated theoretically that chemical adatoms , whether magnetic @xcite or nonmagnetic @xcite , adsorbed on graphene can induce resonant states in the vicinity of the dirac point energy , and these states may give rise to strong scattering of electrons in the graphene .",
    "however , to our knowledge , there has as yet been no direct experimental observation of these dirac point resonances .",
    "the presence of chemical adsorbates , atomic or molecular , on graphene strongly affects electronic properties and makes graphene - based devices suitable for chemical sensing @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the chemical potential of graphene electrons can be easily tuned by a gate voltage , and thus , the adsorbate ionization state can be externally controlled @xcite . using single and few - layer graphene films on top of a sio@xmath2 substrate",
    ", it has been demonstrated that a graphene field - effect transistor can switch between two dimensional electron and hole gases by changing the gate voltage @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that , using an electrochemically top - gated graphene transistor , even much higher electron and hole doping can be induced than by standard sio@xmath2 back - gating @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "an insulating state with large suppression of conductivity can be created in bilayer graphene field - effect transistors by using a top gate in addition to the global back gate @xcite . when an electric field was applied perpendicular to the bilayer , a gap of less than 10 mev at low temperatures @xcite and up to 0.25 ev at room temperature @xcite opened in the bilayer graphene , the size of the gap being tunable by the electric field .    on the other hand , according to density functional theory ( dft ) calculations , cobalt adatoms on graphene show the highest magnetic anisotropy energy relative to other @xmath1 transition metals adsorbed on graphene @xcite .",
    "thus , the co - graphene system has potential applications in magnetic data storage .",
    "recently , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) and spectroscopy measurements demonstrated that individual co atoms deposited onto back - gated graphene devices can be controllably ionized by application of a gate voltage or stm tip bias voltage @xcite .",
    "several different features were observed in the gate - dependence of the measured differential conductance .",
    "inelastic electron tunneling and hybrid electronic - vibrational states were suggested as possible explanations for some of these features .",
    "therefore , the effects of inelastic scattering of electrons should be included in any theoretical study whose objective is to reproduce these features of the calculated inelastic tunneling spectra @xcite .",
    "a different feature is related to a sharp peak in the spectrum which moves in the opposite direction in energy than the graphene dirac point energy in response to changes in the gate voltage .    in a previous theoretical study , using dft electronic structure calculations in a generalized gradient approximation for periodic systems , jacob and kotliar @xcite showed that a single co atom most likely adsorbs at the hollow site of a clean graphene sheet .",
    "they found that the coupling of the co @xmath1 levels to the graphene substrate and the dynamic correlations are strongly dependent on the orbital symmetry , temperature , distance of the co atom from the graphene sheet , and gate voltage .",
    "more recently , chan _",
    "@xcite investigated the gated co - graphene system in a supercell structure with periodic boundary conditions using the local density approximation ( lda)+__u _ _ method , with several values of the _ u _ parameter .",
    "the projected density of states was calculated for different _ u _ values and back gating treated qualitatively by lda+__u _",
    "_ calculations for different integer charge states of the sample per unit cell .",
    "an ionization effect for the co adatom was found as the charge state of the whole system was varied .",
    "no calculated stm current - voltage characteristics were reported , so the calculated local density of states ( ldos ) could not be compared with stm data .",
    "hence , the true ldos of the co - graphene system remains uncertain .",
    "note that experimental and theoretical studies of the interaction between co and graphene have shown charge - transfer to occur between the graphene and co , resulting in the graphene being electron doped @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to reproduce some resonance features seen in the stm experiment by means of dft calculations of the relaxed geometry and the extended hckel model of quantum chemistry @xcite for the electronic structure of co adatom on graphene with dft - based spin splitting parameters . to this end",
    ", we study resonant scattering of spin - up and spin - down electrons by the single co atom adsorbed on gated graphene for electron energies close to the dirac point . the electronic density of states for the co - graphene system is calculated and the dependence of the resonant states on the gate voltage is discussed .",
    "in addition , we investigate the differential conductance of electron tunneling through the co adatom as a function of sample bias and gate voltage which has not been addressed in the previous theories .",
    "our transport calculations show that the experimentally observed behavior of the previously unidentified s - peak in the stm differential conductance spectrum @xcite is consistent with this feature being due to tunneling between the stm tip and a cobalt - induced dirac point resonant state of the graphene , via a co @xmath1 orbital . in this study",
    ", we do not consider the kondo effect of co on graphene @xcite , because this is a many - body effect and outside of the scope of the present study .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the model hamiltonian of the infinite 2d graphene sheet with a single cobalt adatom . we show that the tight - binding hamiltonian for the system can be transformed into an effective graphene hamiltonian that includes the effect of the co adatom . in sec .",
    "iii , we derive an exact relation for the graphene green s function matrix elements in the presence of the adatom using @xmath3-matrix theory .",
    "the results for the spin- and gate - dependent @xmath3-matrix and the electronic density of states will be presented in sec .",
    "iv , where the adsorbate - induced resonance states are discussed .",
    "the effect of local rehybridization of the graphene from the @xmath4 to @xmath5 electronic structure on the dirac point resonances , that occurs when the co atom bonds covalently to the graphene , is also examined . in sec .",
    "v , we present a formalism suitable for studies of the gate - induced ionization of a single co adatom on graphene , seen in the experiment .",
    "we calculate the gate dependence of the differential conductance by means of the landauer - bttiker formalism based on the green s function technique , and the extended hckel theory and dft - based spin splitting parameters and compare the results with the stm measurements of brar _",
    "et al._@xcite . finally , in sec .",
    "vi we conclude this work with a general discussion of the results .",
    "our calculations are performed using _ ab initio _ geometry relaxation based on density functional theory for a co adsorbate on the honeycomb graphene lattice using the gaussian 09 software package together with the hseh1pbe hybrid function and the 6 - 311g(d ) gaussian basis set @xcite .",
    "such a relaxed geometry is expected to be accurate because the density functional theory on which this relaxation is based , has already been well optimized for carrying out accurate ground state total energy calculations .",
    "we found that the lowest - energy binding site is the h - site in which the adsorbate is positioned at height @xmath6  above the middle of a hexagon of the graphene , as shown in fig .",
    "the reason is that , the h - site has the largest number of neighboring c atoms , lowering the adsorption energy .",
    "the structure studied was a graphene disk consisting of 54 carbon atoms passivated at the edges with 18 hydrogen atoms and the co atom being bonded to the graphene at the center of the disk .",
    "all the atoms were allowed to relax freely .",
    "although a finite size cluster of carbon atoms was used in the calculations , the bond lengths between the co atom and its neighboring c atoms were well converged which indicates that 54 c atoms is large enough to model the graphene plane .",
    "the final relaxed structure obtained in this way is shown in fig .",
    "1 . from the figure ,",
    "it is clear that , there is no distortion out of plane of the graphene structure due to the co adsorbate .",
    "this is in agreement with the previous studies of co - graphene systems in periodic supercell structures @xcite .",
    "in addition , we found in - plane distortion of 0.01  in bond length between carbon atoms of central hexagon relative to their nearest neighbor carbon atoms in the graphene plane .",
    "the existence of an in - plane distortion equal to 0.023  in the periodic co - graphene supercell has also been reported by liu _ et al",

    " is the perpendicular distance between the co adsorbate and graphene plane , while @xmath7  is the distance between the adsorbate and stm tip which is directly above the co atom .",
    "the inset shows the top view of the co - graphene system .",
    "the hydrogen atoms at the edges of graphene are not shown here . ]",
    "we describe the present system by a tight - binding model hamiltonian derived from extended hckel theory in a basis of _ extended molecular orbitals _ ( emos ) which are linear combinations of the atomic valence orbitals of the adatom and the 2s , 2@xmath8 , and 2@xmath9 orbitals of the graphene carbon atoms .",

    ", we replace @xmath19 in the hamiltonian by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the electron energy @xcite .",

    "we neglect the small changes in @xmath30 due to the above mentioned in - plane distortion in the graphene geometry , induced by the co atom .",
    "we note that although eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) does not include the overlaps between the nearest neighbor @xmath22 orbitals of the carbon atoms _ explicitly _ , it is a widely used form of the hamiltonian that has been optimized to provide an accurate description of the graphene @xmath0-band states around the dirac point.@xcite we adopt it in the present work for that reason .",

    "note that the overlaps @xmath127 between the co atom and the @xmath22 orbitals of the carbon atoms to which the adsorbate bonds are included in the calculations .",

    "3 it is clear that the spin - down graphene states show a resonance at the energies close to the dirac point that is due to coupling between the graphene and the co @xmath58 orbital .",
    "this resonance is exactly positioned at the dirac point energy at the gate voltage for which @xmath92 , the gate induced shift in energy of the graphene orbitals relative to those of the co , is zero . for this gate voltage the spin - down co @xmath58 state",
    "coincides with the resonant graphene state that appears due to the presence of the co adatom .",
    "furthermore , because of the spin - splitting of the co @xmath1 orbitals , the peak energy of the spin - up co @xmath58 state is somewhat far ( i.e. , at approximately @xmath131 for @xmath107 ) from the dirac point energy and accordingly , only a relatively broad peak due to the spin - up co @xmath58 state appears in the spectrum .",
    "the co @xmath56 and @xmath61 orbitals are completely occupied for both spin states at the gate voltage for which @xmath107 .",
    "note that , the fermi energy @xmath132 is set at the dirac point of graphene , i.e. @xmath133 . in this study ,",
    "only the effect of positive @xmath92 is investigated .",
    "the reason for this will be explained in the next section . in both the graphene and co ldoss",
    "there is an energy shift with changing gate voltage .",
    "although , as we mentioned above , the energy level shift due to the gate voltage is only applied on the graphene plane , the co orbitals are also affected by this effect because , due to the non - zero overlap between the co and graphene atomic orbitals , the effective hopping energies between the carbon and the co orbitals depend on the on - site energies of the carbon orbitals @xcite . in the energy window ( @xmath134 ) that is shown in fig .",
    "3 , the gate voltage decreases the occupation of both spin - up and spin - down graphene states by shifting the electronic states above the fermi level @xmath132 , and hence the occupation of spin - down @xmath58 orbital is also decreased .",
    "this result can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "3 where @xmath92 increases from 0.0@xmath30 to 0.2@xmath30 to 0.4@xmath30 and 0.6@xmath30 and the dirac point of the graphene ( indicated by red arrows ) moves from zero energy to the values of 0.2@xmath30 , 0.4@xmath30 and 0.6@xmath30 , respectively . therefore",
    ", the co orbitals which are coupled to the graphene shift somewhat to the higher energies and the co @xmath58 orbital is gradually emptied of electrons .",
    "this result for co @xmath1 orbitals is in agreement with the recent dft calculations for gated co atom on graphene in supercells with periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , by comparing figs .",
    "3(a)-3(d ) it is clear that , with increasing @xmath92 , the amplitudes of the co @xmath58 and graphene @xmath10 density of states peaks decrease , the energy difference between the dirac point and the graphene resonance state position increases and both the co @xmath58 level and the graphene resonance state induced by co adatom are broadened .",
    "this indicates that the co @xmath58 orbital is coupled strongly to the @xmath0-orbitals of graphene and a gate voltage can ionize the co adatom through this orbital .",
    "this is in agreement with the work of liu _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite in which they reported that the hybridization between @xmath58 orbital of the @xmath1-transition - metal adatoms on graphene and @xmath10 orbitals of the graphene carbon atoms is strong and responsible for strong covalent bonding with graphene .",
    "by contrast , both the @xmath56 and @xmath61 orbitals are strongly localized and far from the dirac point , however , the @xmath56 orbital hybridizes more weakly than the @xmath61 orbital with the graphene states .",
    "note that , comparison of the work of liu _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite with the present results shows somewhat different coupling strengths of the co @xmath61 orbital with @xmath22 orbitals of the carbon atoms which may be attributed to the periodic nature of the structures ( @xmath135 co - graphene supercell ) studied in their calculations .",
    "it may also be relevant that density functional theory - based electronic structure calculations are known to have fundamental limitations that can strongly affect the results that they yield for the coupling between adsorbed atoms and graphene ; see section vii of ref . for a discussion and specific examples .",
    "in addition , the spin - up and spin - down co 4@xmath84 orbitals are far from the @xmath132 ; thus the occupation of these orbitals is zero at low gate voltages , although these orbitals hybridize strongly with the graphene states .",
    "this result is different than the results for periodic structures @xcite in which the co @xmath54 orbital is close to the dirac point energy and the effect of gating can ionize the co atom by occupying or unoccupying the @xmath54 orbitals .",
    "in addition , in the periodic structures , the dirac point resonances are broadened due to the presence of multiple adsorbed atoms on the graphene @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is evident that to better understand the features of adsorbate - induced dirac point resonances and to verify the veracity of the theoretical predictions , comprehensive experimental investigations would be very important .",
    "in this section , assuming coherent transport , we describe how the electronic differential conductance ( @xmath136 ) through a co atom adsorbed on a graphene plane can be calculated using the tight - binding hamiltonians described in the preceding sections and the landauer - bttiker formalism @xcite .",
    "the aim of this is to make a comparison with the stm differential conductance measurements in which the stm tip was held directly above the individual co adatoms deposited onto a back - gated graphene device at 4.2 k @xcite . to simulate the experimental condition",

    "each of the one - dimensional leads is decoupled from the others , thus , there is no hopping between different lead orbitals . according to the above description , the green s function of the co atom coupled to the graphene carbon atoms and the stm system can be written as @xmath147^{-1}\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath148 is a self - energy for an electron with spin @xmath13 and describes the coupling of the adsorbate to the stm tip",

    "the differential conductance is the most direct way to measure the energy - dependent ldos of a system . in the present system , the calculated differential conductance , @xmath161 vs. sample bias @xmath68 for different applied gate voltages",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "4 . note that , the sample bias , @xmath68 , means the voltage of the graphene with respect to the tip . in the present study ,",
    "the graphene remains at the zero potential and the tip is at negative voltages , similarly to the experiment .",
    "hence , when a negative voltage is applied to the tip , the sample bias is positive ( @xmath162 ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the gate - dependent @xmath163 spectra in the experiment , were measured at negative gate voltages .",
    "the measurements showed that , when the gate voltage moves to more negative values , the dirac point position shifts to positive energies [ see fig .",
    "2b in ref .",
    "this behavior is clearly equivalent to application of positive @xmath92 values as we have done in section iv and can be seen in fig .",
    "3 .    the calculated differential conductance @xmath163 shows a sharp peak at @xmath107 that comes from the co spin - down resonant state .",
    "the height of this peak decreases while the spectrum is broadened as the gate voltage is varied and @xmath109 increases .",
    "this effect is due to the nature of resonant states induced in the graphene near the dirac point by the presence of an adsorbate ; as can be seen in fig .",
    "3 these resonant states become narrower and stronger as the associated energy level of the co adsorbate approaches the dirac point energy , i.e. , @xmath164 .",
    "when @xmath109 increases , the cobalt orbital goes out of resonance with the graphene density of states peak in the vicinity of the dirac point and the sharp conductance peak is suppressed .    in the experiment of brar _",
    "@xcite , it has been demonstrated that the difference between the location of dirac point voltage ( marked @xmath165 in fig .",
    "2b of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , associated with the dirac point energy @xcite , and the peak in the differential conductance signal ( marked s in fig . 2a and 2b of ref . )",
    "increases as the magnitude of experimental gate voltage is increased .",
    "this enhancement in the difference between the dirac point energy and the energy of the s state with increasing the gate voltage is in good agreement with the result of fig .",
    "3 which shows that , although with increasing @xmath92 both the cobalt - induced resonance feature ( blue arrows ) and the dirac point energy ( red arrow ) in the ldos spectrum of fig .",
    "3 move in the same direction , the dirac point location moves more rapidly and the difference in energy between both locations ( red and blue arrows ) increases with @xmath92 .    the experimental data @xcite exhibits a sharp resonant peak s in the @xmath163 spectrum at low gate voltages in fig . 2a of ref . .",
    "with increasing absolute value of the gate voltage , the height of the peak decreases and the peak moves to lower sample bias .",
    "the sharp peak seen for @xmath107 in our model ( fig.4 ) , is similar to the observed resonant peak s in fig .",
    "2a of ref . at low gate voltages",
    "and evolves with gate voltage in a qualitatively similar way as well .",
    "the peaks in the @xmath163 spectra in fig.4 occur at the sample bias voltages at which the stm tip fermi energy crosses the peaks of the partial densities of states that are due to the co d @xmath58 state and the associated co - induced graphene resonant state that are seen in fig.3 a2-d2 .",
    "these density of states features in fig.3 a2-d2 _ and the peaks in @xmath163 spectra in fig.4 _ are strongest and narrowest when the energy of the co d @xmath58 state coincides with the graphene dirac point energy , which occurs for @xmath107 .",
    "the same is true of the dirac point resonance peak of the @xmath3-matrix as can be seen in fig.2 and its inset .",
    "the large increase in the intensity of the experimentally observed resonant peak s in fig .",
    "2a of ref .",
    "( with decreasing absolute value of the gate voltage ) also occurs as the s - peak energy approaches that of the graphene dirac point energy ( labelled @xmath166 ) in fig .",
    "2b of ref . .",
    "we conclude that the large increase in the intensity of the resonant peak s in fig .",
    "2a of ref .",
    "with decreasing absolute value of the gate voltage is the experimental stm signature of the strengthening and narrowing of dirac point resonance induced in the graphene by the co ( and of the associated co level as well ) as the co level crosses the graphene dirac point energy .",
    "thus we propose that stm is able to detect the presence of adsorbate - induced dirac point resonances in the graphene by monitoring the intensity of conductance peaks associated with orbitals of the adsorbate as those adsorbate levels cross the graphene dirac point with changing gate voltage .",
    "systematic experimental studies of adsorbate - induced dirac point resonances in graphene based on this finding would be of considerable interest since experimental studies of these resonances have , to our knowledge , not been reported previously despite the considerable theoretical interest@xcite in this topic .",
    "the gate dependence of @xmath163 also indicates that the value of @xmath92 determines the ionization state of the co atom , because by changing the value of @xmath92 , the co @xmath1 states can cross the fermi energy and accordingly the charge occupation in these states changes .",
    "therefore , the application of gate voltage enables tuning the charge - carrier density of graphene and hence the variation of co adatom ionization state .    in the present model ,",
    "the distance between the tip and the co atom is @xmath167=4  .",
    "therefore , the overlap and hence the direct coupling between the co atom and the tip is weak and that between the tip and the graphene is much weaker still .",
    "the reason is that , the sum of pt and co atomic radii is @xmath168  which is considerably less than @xmath167 which results in a small overlap between their atomic wave functions . in reality , the co levels couple the stm tip to the graphene to open a conductive channel for electron transport .",
    "since the coupling between the @xmath58-levels of adsorbate and the stm tip is weak the transport process for such levels is tunneling and the differential conductance spectra are quite similar to the @xmath58 resonance state ldos seen in fig .",
    "3 . from the extended hckel theory hopping parameters between the co atom and the pt atom",
    ", we found that the @xmath84-levels of both atoms hybridize more strongly than that the other levels .",
    "the hopping energy between @xmath84-levels is roughly one order of magnitude greater than the hopping energy between @xmath58-levels .",
    "note that , in this work because of the position of the co @xmath58-level relative to the graphene dirac point and also to the other levels such as co @xmath54-level , the @xmath58 level plays the main role in the tunneling transport through the cobalt atom at low values of the gate voltage .",
    "the curves are shifted by offsets of 0.05 @xmath169 with respect to each other . ]    finally , it should be mentioned that we also examined the electron transmission through the co adatom in the graphene - co - pt structure using the landauer theory and the lippmann - schwinger equation @xcite in which the emos included in the graphene were linear combinations of the atomic valence orbitals of the co atom and the @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 valence orbitals of graphene carbon atoms .",
    "the results , except with a small shift in the energy of the resonant states , were the same that we obtained based on the present method .",
    "this confirms that by the inclusion of just carbon @xmath22 orbitals in the graphene self - energy , we can obtain the same resonance feature in the conductance spectrum that we obtained based on the lippmann - schwinger approach .",
    "in this study , we have presented a tight - binding theory of the dirac point resonances due to a single co adatom on gated graphene based on the @xmath0-band tight - binding description of the graphene plane with nearest neighbor hopping energy @xmath30 and the extended hckel model of the adsorbate and the adsorbate - induced local @xmath5 rehybridization of the graphene . using the generalized effective hamiltonian @xcite for the relaxed geometry of co - graphene system based on @xmath170 @xmath171 density functional theory",
    ", we found a strong spin - dependent scattering resonance at the dirac point of graphene and a gate dependence of this resonance .",
    "this resonance arises from a hybridization of co atomic orbitals with graphene states and such resonances have been predicted for @xmath1 transition metals adsorbed on graphene @xcite .",
    "the energy position of the co atomic levels with respect to the graphene fermi energy determines the ionization state of the adsorbate . because of spin - splitting of co @xmath54 and @xmath1 orbitals , this ionization is different for spin - up and spin - down states .",
    "the results showed that , the co @xmath58 state can be emptied with electrons as the state shifts above the fermi energy through application of gate voltage , in agreement with the recent experiment @xcite .",
    "the change in the occupation of the co @xmath1 orbitals and hence in the ionization state of the adatom by application of gate voltage has also been predicted using dft - based calculations for periodic systems . @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we presented a formalism that we used to model the differential conductance measurements .",
    "our calculation shows that , when the co adatom states cross the dirac point , a sharp feature is induced in the @xmath163 spectrum which is consistent with experiment and has not been addressed theoretically , previously .",
    "the height , broadening and the position of this feature is strongly dependent on gate voltage . the agreement between this theoretical dependence and the experimentally observed behavior of the s - peak in the stm differential conductance spectrum @xcite",
    "allows us to attribute the s - peak to tunneling between the stm tip and a cobalt - induced dirac point resonant state of the graphene , via a co @xmath1 orbital .",
    "systematic experimental studies of adsorbate - induced dirac point resonances in graphene based on this finding would be of interest .",
    "our results also show the dirac point energy of graphene and the cobalt - induced resonance feature in the differential conductance spectrum to move in different ways when a gate voltage is applied .",
    "therefore the ionization state of co adatom can be tuned by application of a gate voltage which induces a change in the occupation of the co @xmath1 states . from the above findings regarding the @xmath3-matrix and the electronic density of states",
    "we can conclude that the co adatom on graphene has a strongly spin - polarized ldos especially at electron energies in the vicinity of the dirac point of graphene .",
    "this suggests that co adatoms on gated graphene may have possible applications in magnetic data storage and magnetic sensors and other applications which may be discovered .",
