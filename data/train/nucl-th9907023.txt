    "during the past few years , we have studied a number of nuclei around doubly magic @xmath5sn and @xmath6sn @xcite in terms of the shell model employing realistic effective interactions derived from the meson - theoretic bonn a nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath7 ) potential @xcite . in these studies",
    "we have considered nuclei with few valence particles or holes , their properties being of special interest for a stringent test of the basic ingredients of shell - model calculations .",
    "the aim of our work is to assess the ability of realistic effective interactions to provide a quantitative description of nuclear structure properties .",
    "this is in fact a key point to understand if the time has come to make the shell model a truly microscopic theory of nuclear structure .",
    "as is well known , the first step in this direction was taken more than thirty years ago by kuo and brown @xcite who derived an @xmath8-shell effective interaction from the hamada - johnston potential @xcite .",
    "later on , an effective interaction for the lead region was derived @xcite by kuo and herling ( kh ) from the same potential . since then , however , substantial progress has been made in both the development of high - quality @xmath7 potentials and the many - body methods for calculating the matrix elements of the effective interaction .    as regards the first point",
    ", modern potentials reproduce quite accurately all the known @xmath7 scattering data .",
    "a review of recent developments in the field of @xmath7 potentials is given in refs .",
    "we only recall here that two potentials which fit equally well the @xmath7 data up to the inelastic threshold may differ substantially in their off - shell behavior .",
    "thus , different @xmath7 potentials may produce somewhat different nuclear structure results .",
    "as for the second point , an accurate calculation of the brueckner @xmath4 matrix is now feasible while the so - called folded - diagram expansion yields a rigorous expression for the model - space effective interaction @xmath9 .",
    "the main aspects of the above derivation of @xmath9 are described in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "based on these improvements , a new generation of realistic effective interactions has become available , fostering renewed interest in realistic shell - model calculations .",
    "it is in this context that our recent studies of medium - mass nuclei are framed .",
    "the remarkably good agreement between theory and experiment obtained for these nuclei has challenged us to perform the same kind of realistic shell - model calculations for heavy - mass nuclei . in a previous work @xcite we considered the neutron hole isotopes @xmath10pb . here , we present the results of a companion study of the @xmath0 isotones , focusing attention on @xmath1po , @xmath2at , and @xmath3rn .",
    "these nuclei , with two to four protons in the @xmath11 shell , offer the opportunity to further test our realistic effective interactions in the lead region .",
    "the @xmath0 nuclei , as well as the lead isotopes , have long been the subject of both experimental and theoretical studies . from the experimental point of view",
    ", these stable or near - stable nuclei have been extensively investigated and a rather large amount of experimental data is available for them . on the other hand ,",
    "the good doubly magic character of @xmath12pb has motivated many shell - model calculations in this region . in all the calculations",
    "performed so far , however , phenomenological interactions have been used @xcite , the only notable exception being the pioneering work of mcgrory and kuo @xcite , where the kh interaction was employed .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give an outline of our calculations , including a brief review of the derivation of the effective interaction . in sec .",
    "iii we present the results obtained for binding energies , energy spectra and electromagnetic properties , comparing them with the experimental data .",
    "iv contains a discussion and a summary of our conclusions .",
    "we assume that @xmath12pb is a closed core and let the valence protons occupy the six single - particle ( sp ) orbits @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "we take the sp energies from the experimental spectrum of @xmath19bi @xcite .",
    "they are ( in mev ) : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , we use in the present calculation a realistic effective interaction derived from the bonn a free @xmath7 potential .",
    "let us now outline our derivation of @xmath9 .",
    "because of the strong repulsive core contained in the bonn a potential , which is a feature common to all modern @xmath7 potentials , the model - space @xmath4 matrix corresponding to the chosen @xmath26 must be calculated first .",
    "the @xmath4 matrix is defined @xcite by the integral equation :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 represents the @xmath7 potential , @xmath29 denotes the two - nucleon kinetic energy , and @xmath30 is an energy variable ( the so - called starting energy ) .",
    "the two - body pauli exclusion operator @xmath31 prevents double counting , namely the intermediate states allowed for @xmath4 must be outside of the chosen model space .",
    "thus the pauli operator @xmath31 is dependent on the model space , and so is the @xmath4 matrix .",
    "the operator @xmath31 is specified , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , by a set of three numbers @xmath32 each representing a shell - model orbital ( we number the orbits starting from the bottom of the oscillator well ; for instance , the orbit @xmath33 is denoted as orbit 4 and @xmath34 as orbit 16 ) .",
    "note that in eq.(1 ) the pauli exclusion operator @xmath31 is defined in terms of harmonic oscillator wave functions while plane - wave functions are employed for the intermediate states of the @xmath4 matrix .    since the valence - proton and -neutron orbits outside @xmath12pb are different , our @xmath31 operators for protons and for neutrons are different and consequently our @xmath4-matrix calculation is considerably more complicated than in the case when the two operators are the same . in the present calculation",
    "we have fixed @xmath35 for the neutron orbits , and @xmath36 for the proton orbits .",
    "our procedure for calculating the @xmath4 matrix is outlined below .",
    "we first calculate the free @xmath4 matrix @xmath37 in a proton - neutron representation , @xmath37 being defined by @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "note that @xmath37 does not contain the pauli exclusion operator and hence its calculation is relatively convenient .",
    "then we calculate the pauli correction term @xcite , @xmath40 where @xmath41 , separately for protons and for neutrons .",
    "finally the full @xmath4 matrix as defined by eq.(1 ) is obtained as @xmath42    for the harmonic oscillator parameter @xmath43 we use the value 6.88 mev , as obtained from the expression @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "note that in the present work we have chosen the value of @xmath46 so as to include three harmonic oscillator shells above the fermi level denoted by @xmath47 . in earlier works on light- and medium - mass nuclei ,",
    "@xmath46 was fixed by taking into account only two major shells above the @xmath47-th orbit .",
    "for instance , a common choice for @xmath8-shell calculations is @xmath46=10 with @xmath47=3 @xcite . for the @xmath0 isotones ,",
    "however , the present choice is more appropriate .",
    "in fact , these calculations as well as those for lead isotopes @xcite have led to a substantially better agreement with experiment when in the derivation of the effective interaction @xmath46 has been increased from two to three shells above the @xmath48-th orbit .    using the above @xmath4 matrix",
    "we then calculate the irreducible vertex function @xmath49-box , which is composed of irreducible valence - linked @xmath4-matrix diagrams through second order in @xmath4 .",
    "these are precisely the seven first- and second - order diagrams considered by shurpin _",
    "the effective interaction can be written in operator form as    @xmath50    where @xmath49 is the @xmath49-box , and the integral sign represents a generalized folding operation @xcite .",
    "@xmath51 is obtained from @xmath49 by removing terms of first order in the reaction matrix @xmath4 .",
    "after the @xmath49-box is calculated , the energy - independent @xmath9 is then obtained by summing up the folded - diagram series of eq.(5 ) to all orders using the lee - suzuki iteration method @xcite .",
    "this last step can be performed in an essentially exact way for a given @xmath49-box .",
    "once the effective interaction has been derived , the shell - model calculations are carried out employing the oxbash code @xcite .",
    "as regards the electromagnetic observables , we have calculated them by making use of effective operators @xcite which take into account core - polarization effects .",
    "more precisely , by using a diagrammatic description as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have only included first - order diagrams in @xmath4 .",
    "this implies that folded - diagram renormalizations are not necessary @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the nuclear magnetic properties may be significantly affected by mesonic exchange currents .",
    "an estimate of their contribution for nuclei in the vicinity of @xmath12pb has been given in refs .",
    "this amounts to renormalizing the gyromagnetic factor @xmath52 from the bare value of @xmath53 to @xmath54 and @xmath55 from @xmath56 to @xmath57 .",
    "we have made use of these values in our calculation of the effective @xmath58 operator .",
    "in this section the results of our calculations for the three nuclei @xmath1po , @xmath2at , and @xmath3rn are presented and compared with experiment .",
    "the energy spectra are presented separately for each isotone in the three following subsections . for @xmath1po a detailed comparison between calculated and observed spectroscopic factors",
    "is also reported .",
    "the last subsection is devoted to the discussion of the electromagnetic properties of all three nuclei .",
    "the calculated ground - state binding energies relative to @xmath12pb are compared with the observed values @xcite in table i. the mass excess value for @xmath19bi needed for absolute scaling of the sp levels was taken from @xcite . as regards the coulomb interaction between the valence protons , we have assumed that it gives a contribution proportional to the number of interacting proton pairs , namely @xmath59 ( @xmath60 is the number of valence protons ) .",
    "the strength @xmath61 has been taken to be 270 kev , which is the value of the matrix element of the coulomb force between two @xmath62 protons with @xmath63 .    from table",
    "i we see that a very good agreement with experiment is obtained for all three nuclei .",
    "in fact , the calculated binding energy for @xmath1po falls practically within the error bar , while the other two calculated values differ by less than 100 kev from the experimental ones .",
    "the experimental @xcite and theoretical spectra of @xmath1po are compared in fig . 1 . here",
    "all the calculated and experimental levels up to 3.3 mev are reported , while in the higher - energy region the negative - parity states have been excluded ( in the experimental spectrum we have also omitted three states without spin and parity assignment ) .",
    "the calculated states which are shown in fig",
    ". 1 are all the 44 states arising from the configurations @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 . in the energy region 3.5 - 4.5",
    "mev we find the eight negative - parity states of the @xmath71 configuration , but for them , as mentioned above , we have not tried to establish any correspondence with observed levels .",
    "in fact , in this energy interval negative - parity states have been observed which can not be described within our model space . as an example",
    ", we mention the @xmath72 and @xmath73 states , which can not be constructed in our model space , and the three @xmath74 levels observed at 3.43 , 3.70 , and 3.71 mev to which corresponds only one calculated @xmath74 state at 3.85 mev .",
    "these experimental `` extra '' levels arise from core excitations , and in some cases significant admixtures of these excitations and two - particle model - space states are likely to occur .    in fig .",
    "1 we see that the calculated spectrum is characterized by four groups of levels : the first one up to 1.6 mev , the second between 2.2 and 2.5 mev , the third between 2.7 and 3.3 mev , and the fourth above 3.8 mev .",
    "the five levels of the first group are dominated by the @xmath64 configuration , while the second group contains all the members of the @xmath65 multiplet , besides the @xmath75 state arising from the @xmath67 configuration .",
    "the other three states of this latter configuration together with all the states arising from the @xmath66 configuration are in the third group .",
    "all the states in these three groups , with few exceptions , are almost pure , the percentage of the dominant configuration ranging from 95 to 100% . only for the ground state and the @xmath76 and @xmath77 states the contribution coming from configurations other than the dominant one is particularly significant , the percentage of such configurations being 21 , 28 , and 16% , respectively .",
    "the 17 levels arising from the configurations @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 all lie in the energy interval 3.8 - 4.8 mev .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that for most of these states the wave functions are not quite pure . in particular , we find that a significant admixture of the three above configurations is present in the even @xmath78 states .    up to 3.3 mev excitation energy each state of a given @xmath79 in the calculated spectrum can be unambiguously associated with an observed level , the only exception being the @xmath77 state at 2.95 mev excitation energy . however ,",
    "two levels with no angular momentum and parity assignment have been observed at 2.66 and 2.87 mev , and in ref .",
    "@xcite it is suggested that the 2.87-kev @xmath80 ray measured in the @xmath19bi@xmath81po reaction is a good candidate for the @xmath82 transition .",
    "the experimental @xmath83 state at 2.39 mev , as well as the the @xmath84 and @xmath85 states at 2.91 and 3.11 mev , respectively , have no theoretical counterpart .",
    "in fact , the first one reflects the collective nature of the octupole @xmath86 state at 2.61 mev in @xmath12pb , while the other two levels arise from the neutron particle - hole configuration @xmath87 @xcite , and therefore can not be described within our model space .",
    "it should be noted that each of the two above @xmath84 and @xmath85 levels lies very close in energy to the state with the same @xmath88 originating from the @xmath66 configuration .",
    "therefore it can not be excluded , as we shall see when discussing the spectroscopic factors , that some mixing occurs between single - particle and core - excited states .    above 3.8 mev",
    "only 10 out of the 17 levels arising from the configurations @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 have been experimentally identified .",
    "for all of them , except the @xmath89 state at 4.55 mev , a correspondence with states predicted by the theory can be safely established . as for the @xmath89 state",
    ", it may be associated with either the @xmath90 or the @xmath91 calculated states , which lie at 4.48 and 4.52 mev excitation energy , respectively . in a very recent work @xcite the assignment",
    "@xmath92 has been proposed for the experimental level at 4.55 mev and a new level with @xmath93 has been identified at 4.54 mev .    as regards the quantitative agreement , we see from fig .",
    "1 that it is very satisfactory , the discrepancies between calculated and experimental excitation energies being less than 100 kev for most of the states . more precisely ,",
    "including the level at 2.87 mev ( identified as a @xmath94 state ) as well as the @xmath95 and @xmath92 of ref .",
    "@xcite , 37 observed levels have been associated with states predicted by the theory , and only for seven of them the experimental and calculated excitation energies differ by more than 100 kev .",
    "the rms deviation @xmath96 @xcite relative to these 37 levels is 87 kev .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath19bi@xmath97he,@xmath98po and @xmath19bi@xmath99he,@xmath100po reactions have been studied and the single - proton strengths of transitions to various excited levels in @xmath1po have been extracted from the measured cross sections .",
    "these observed strengths are compared with the calculated values in table ii , where we also list the experimental and theoretical excitation energies .",
    "the experimental uncertainties appearing in table ii are only statistical and the numbers in parentheses , which correspond to levels not fully resolved , were extracted by a peak fitting procedure ( see ref .",
    "the theoretical spectroscopic factor @xmath101 is defined as    @xmath102    where we assume that the ground state of @xmath19bi is a single @xmath62 proton outside the doubly magic @xmath12pb .",
    "the label @xmath103 specifies states of @xmath1po with the same @xmath88 .    from table",
    "ii we see that for almost all the states of the three low - lying multiplets the agreement between theory and experiment is very good .",
    "actually , a significant discrepancy exists only for the @xmath104 and the second @xmath74 state .",
    "however , it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that the level at 2.85 mev was an unresolved doublet with @xmath105 and @xmath86 , as it has been found later to be the case @xcite .",
    "thus the observed strength , 3.25 , attributed to the @xmath104 state has to be compared to the sum of the two calculated strengths relative to the @xmath104 and @xmath86 states , which are 2.30 and 0.69 , respectively . as for the @xmath74 state ,",
    "our calculation overestimates the experimental value .",
    "part of the single particle strength is contained in the first @xmath74 state , which , as mentioned above , is not predicted by the theory , being essentially a core - excited state .    in the region above 3.8 mev",
    "the values of the measured strengths ( @xmath106 and 3 ) are generally smaller than those relative to the states of the three low - lying multiplets . on the other hand ,",
    "as it was already pointed out at the beginning of this section , the calculated wave functions of several states in this region show a strong admixture of the configurations @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "thus , a comparison between theory and experiment may provide a test of the calculated percentages of the @xmath69 and @xmath70 configurations ( obviously , the contribution of the @xmath107 configuration is not determined directly from the measured strengths ) .",
    "it should also be noted that the experimental data do not allow to distinguish between @xmath108 and @xmath109 transfers .",
    "we have found , however , that a small component of the @xmath110 configuration is present only in the @xmath111 and @xmath91 states . from table",
    "ii we see to the observed strengths of the states above 3.8 mev are quite well reproduced by the theory .",
    "note that the level at 4.55 mev excited via @xmath112 transfer is likely to correspond to an unresolved doublet with @xmath95 and @xmath113 ( see discussion above ) . in this case",
    "the measured strength , 1.83 , should be interpreted as the sum of the calculated strengths 1.50 and 0.20 relative to the @xmath90 and @xmath91 states , respectively . in this connection , it should be pointed out that the observed strength of the level at 4.55 mev excited via @xmath114 transfer and assigned @xmath115 @xcite is also well reproduced by our calculation .",
    "the experimental @xcite and theoretical spectra of @xmath2at are compared in fig .",
    "2 , where all the observed levels up to 3.3 mev excitation energy are reported . in the calculated spectrum all the levels up to about 2.0 mev are included while in the higher - energy region only the states which can be associated to the observed ones are reported .",
    "for the sake of completeness all the calculated excitation energies up to 2.7 mev are listed in table iii .    from fig .",
    "2 we see that a one - to - one correspondence can be established between the experimental and calculated levels up to 1.5 mev , the only exception being the experimental @xmath116 level at 1.35 mev which can be associated to either the @xmath117 or @xmath118 calculated state .",
    "as regards the two observed levels with no firm spin assignment at 1.12 and 1.23 mev , we propose the assignment @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively .    above 1.5 mev many more levels than the observed ones are predicted by our calculations . in particular , in the energy interval 1.5 - 2.0 mev we find 12 levels , only three of them having the experimental counterpart .",
    "these three states have @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 and can be identified with the calculated states with the same angular momentum and parity at 1.82 , 1.97 , and 2.04 mev , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that we predict the existence of a lower - lying @xmath124 state at 1.85 mev .",
    "as regards the states above 2.0 mev , we identify the experimental @xmath125 level at 2.06 mev with the calculated one with @xmath126 at 2.11 mev , thus confirming the tentative assignment of ref .",
    "as far as the lowest @xmath127 state is concerned , the calculated energy is 2.78 mev , namely 300 kev higher than that of the observed one .",
    "however , this state , which was populated in a first - forbidden @xmath128 decay of the ground state of @xmath2rn @xcite , has been interpreted as a core - excited @xmath3rn @xmath129 state and , as such , is not expected to be adequately reproduced within our model space . in ref .",
    "@xcite the nature and assignment of the @xmath130 level at 2.65 mev was also discussed and it was suggested that it originates from a mixing of the two @xmath3rn @xmath131 and @xmath2at(gs ) @xmath132pb@xmath133 core - excited states .",
    "we may only mention here that up to 3.5 mev our calculations predict the existence of the three @xmath134 states reported in fig .",
    "2 and of no other @xmath127 aside the above mentioned one .",
    "the quantitative agreement between our results and experiment is very satisfactory .",
    "in fact , the discrepancies for the excitation energies are all in the order of few tens of kev , the only exception being the @xmath135 state , which comes about 170 kev below its experimental counterpart . excluding the @xmath127 state and the two levels at 1.35 and 2.65 mev , for which we have not attempted any identification ,",
    "the @xmath96 value is only 64 kev .",
    "it should be noted that all the ten levels arising from the @xmath136 configuration lie at an excitation energy smaller than 1.5 mev . in this energy region",
    "we also find the two seniority @xmath137 states of the @xmath138 and @xmath139 configurations .",
    "the latter states as well as the ground state contain , however , significant configuration mixing .",
    "in fact , the percentage of configurations other than the dominant one is 22% in the ground and @xmath140 states , reducing to 14% in the @xmath141 state . in all other levels up to 1.5 mev",
    "the percentage of the dominant configuration ranges from 90 to 98% . above 1.5 mev",
    "the negative - parity states are members of the multiplet @xmath142 , while all the positive - parity ones originate from the @xmath139 configuration , except the @xmath143 state , which arises from the @xmath144 configuration .",
    "all these states are essentially pure , the only exception being the @xmath145 state , which contains 38% of the @xmath146 configuration .",
    "rather little experimental information @xcite is presently available for @xmath3rn .",
    "up to about 4 mev only 22 excited states have been identified ( nine of them with unknown spin and parity ) , while our calculations predict a much higher level density . in particular , in the low - energy region ( up to 2.6 mev ) we find 27 states compared to 8 in the experimental spectrum .",
    "in this situation , any attempt to associate calculated states with experimental levels without assigned spin and parity may be misleading .",
    "therefore , in fig .",
    "3 we exclude such states in the experimental spectrum and report only those yrast and yrare calculated states which are candidates for the observed levels . for completeness , all the calculated excitation energies up to about 2.6 mev are listed in table iv . it should be mentioned that above 4 mev excitation energy several high - spin states have been observed . in fig .",
    "3 , however , we do not include these levels , since their description is likely to require that core - excited states be explicitly taken into account .    from fig .",
    "3 we see that the calculated spectrum reproduces very well the experimental one , the discrepancies being smaller than 100 kev for the energies of 9 out of the 13 states considered .",
    "the rms deviation @xmath96 is only 85 kev , in line with the values obtained for the two lighter isotones .    as regards the structure of the states , we find that the wave functions of the seven higher - lying levels are substantially pure .",
    "these states are members of the three multiplets @xmath147 ( @xmath148 ) , @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) , and @xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) , and the percentage of the dominant configuration is at least 95% .",
    "this is not the case for the lower - lying states , whose wave functions contain significant configuration mixing . in the first four excited states",
    "the percentage of the dominant configuration , @xmath147 , ranges from 71 to 76% while it becomes 55% in the ground state . as for the @xmath153 and @xmath104 states ,",
    "the percentages of the dominant configurations , @xmath149 and @xmath154 , are 80 and 82% , respectively .",
    "the effective operators needed for the calculation of electromagnetic observables have been derived as described in sec .",
    "ii .    in table",
    "v we compare the experimental magnetic moments in @xmath1po , @xmath2at and @xmath3rn @xcite with the calculated values .",
    "we see that the agreement is remarkably good in all cases .",
    "only two @xmath58 reduced transition probabilities are known in @xmath2at @xcite .",
    "they are compared with our theoretical results in table vii .",
    "we see that both the calculated and experimental values are extremely small .",
    "let us now come to the electric observables .",
    "in tables vi and vii we compare the calculated quadrupole moments and @xmath155 , @xmath156 transition rates with the experimental ones @xcite .",
    "the agreement is very good , the only discrepancy regarding the @xmath157 in @xmath1po .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that the experimental value was obtained by comparing the cross section @xmath158 measured in a @xmath1po study by inelastic scattering of deuterons with the corresponding one for @xmath159pb @xcite .",
    "as far as the quadrupole moments are concerned , 4 out of the 5 calculated values are within the error bars and the observed signs , when measured , are correctly reproduced .",
    "it is worth noting that our results do not differ significantly from those obtained using an effective proton charge @xmath160 , which is consistent with the values adopted by other authors @xcite .    as regards the @xmath161 s , they are all underestimated by our calculations .",
    "it is well known that enhanced @xmath156 transitions in nuclei in the lead region can be taken as a signature of mixing of the @xmath86 core excitation into the involved levels @xcite .",
    "we should note , however , that whereas our calculations fail to reproduce the @xmath161 values , a good description of the states involved in such transitions is obtained for the excitation energies as well as for the other electromagnetic properties .",
    "thus , these states are likely to contain very small components of octupole excitation which , however , are sufficient to largely enhance the @xmath156 transition rates . in particular , the @xmath156 transitions in @xmath2at and @xmath3rn , and the @xmath162 transition in @xmath1po correspond to the single - particle transition @xmath163 , which is expected to be very fast owing to the coupling between the @xmath164 orbital and the @xmath86 collective state @xcite .",
    "the @xmath165 transition in @xmath1po is instead of the type @xmath166 and is slowed down by spin flip .",
    "in this work , we have performed shell - model calculations for the @xmath0 isotones @xmath1po , @xmath2at , and @xmath3rn , employing an effective interaction derived from the bonn a nucleon - nucleon potential by means of a @xmath4-matrix folded - diagram method . as for the single - proton energies , we have taken them from the experimental spectrum of @xmath19bi .",
    "it should be stressed that , since we have also derived in a microscopic way the effective operators needed for the calculation of electromagnetic observables , no use has been made of any adjustable parameter .",
    "these calculations , as well as the previous ones on neutron hole pb isotopes @xcite , are the first in the @xmath12pb region where a modern realistic interaction has been used . as already mentioned in the introduction , the first attempt to employ in this region effective interactions derived from the free nucleon - nucleon potential dates back to the early 70s @xcite . in that work , however , the hamada - johnston @xmath7 potential was used and only the 3p-1h core - polarization diagram ( the so - called bubble ) was included in the calculation of the effective interaction .",
    "it should also be noted that to obtain good agreement with experiment for the @xmath167pb isotopes , the bubble was multiplied by the empirical factor 0.75 .",
    "as regards our calculations , we have obtained a very good description of both @xmath0 isotones and pb isotopes in a truly microscopic way .",
    "it can not be said , however , that our agreement with experiment is much better than that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this connection , we found it worthwhile to calculate the complete energy spectrum of @xmath1po up to 5 mev making use of the kh effective interaction .",
    "it turned out that the @xmath96 value relative to the 37 levels considered in sec .",
    "iii a is 116 kev , namely only about 30 kev larger than our value . on the other hand",
    ", it should be mentioned that a comparison between the results of the two calculations evidences more substantial differences .",
    "more precisely , the calculation with the kh interaction predicts some levels to lie 300 - 400 kev above those obtained with our effective interaction .",
    "we do not feel , however , that a detailed comparison between the two kinds of calculations is very meaningful .",
    "we consider as the main achievement of our studies of nuclei around @xmath12pb to have shown that effective interactions derived from the bonn a potential by means of a @xmath4-matrix folded - diagram approach lead to a quite accurate description of these nuclei .",
    "this outcome acquires more relevance when considered along with the results of our studies on nuclei with few valence particles or holes in the region of doubly magic @xmath5sn and @xmath6sn @xcite .",
    "in fact , the remarkable overall agreement with experiment obtained in all cases considered leads to the conclusion that the new generation of realistic effective interactions is quite adequate for nuclear structure calculations .",
    "actually , being focused on identical particle systems , our studies provide a stringent test of the isospin @xmath168 matrix elements of the effective interaction .",
    "a test of the @xmath169 matrix elements is of course equally important . in this connection",
    ", it may be mentioned that in earlier works @xcite it turned out that not enough attraction was provided by the calculated matrix elements of the @xmath169 effective interaction , which has a stronger dependence on the tensor force strength than the @xmath168 interaction .",
    "we should point out , however , that in a recent study @xcite of the doubly odd nucleus @xmath6sb we have obtained results which are as good as those regarding like nucleon systems . along the same lines we are currently studying other nuclei with both neutrons and protons outside closed shells .",
    "a main question relevant to microscopic nuclear structure calculations is the extent to which they depend on the @xmath7 potential used as input . we are currently trying to explore this problem .",
    "preliminary calculations indicate that different @xmath7 potentials produce somewhat different nuclear structure results @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has turned out that the best agreement with experiment is produced by the bonn a potential .    in conclusion , at the present stage of our investigation of the role of realistic effective interactions in complex nuclei , it is our belief that a truly microscopic description of nuclear structure properties is now within reach .",
