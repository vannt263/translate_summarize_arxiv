    "nematic elastomers are rubber - like solids made of a polymer network incorporating nematogenic molecules .",
    "one of the main features of these materials is their ability to accommodate macroscopic deformations at no energy cost . indeed , while the nematic mesogens are randomly oriented at high temperature , below a certain transition temperature they align to have their long axes roughly parallel and this alignment causes a spontaneous elastic deformation of the underlying polymer network . if @xmath0 represents the direction of the nematic alignment , the gradient of the induced spontaneous deformation is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a non - dimensional material parameter .",

    "this is an energy density studied in @xcite and can be considered as an `` ogden - type '' generalization of the classical `` neo - hookean '' expression originally proposed by bladon , terentjev and warner @xcite to model an incompressible nematic elastomer .",
    "this is obtained from ( [ inco_intro ] ) by setting @xmath14 and @xmath15 . passing to the energy stored by the system when this is free to adjust @xmath16 at fixed @xmath17 , we define @xmath18 this energy density is always nonnegative and it vanishes precisely when @xmath19 , for some @xmath0 .",
    "in other words , by left polar decomposition , the set of wells of @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 some experimental tests on samples of nematic elastomers show that these materials tend to develop microstructures . in the mathematical model presented above ,",
    "the formation of microstructures , which heavily influences the macroscopic material response , is encoded in the energy - wells structure , which makes the density non quasiconvex .",
    "in fact , minimization with respect to @xmath16 leads to a loss of stability of homogeneously deformed states with respect to configurations which exhibit shear bands and look like stripe domains . adopting a variational point of view ,",
    "one is then typically interested in the study of the free - energy functional @xmath22 , with @xmath23 a deformation , under the basic assumption that the observed microstructures correspond to minimizers or almost minimizers of @xmath24 .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that some appropriate dynamical models for nematic elastomers and the associated time - dependent evolutions may select , in the limit as the time goes to infinity , some minimizers of @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , the study of the existence of exact minimizers attempted in this paper is a natural first step before attempting the analysis of time - dependent models .    in this paper",
