    "figure [ spatial ] shows the position of the co emission compared to the h@xmath7 and far - uv maps .",
    "these maps were created by summing channels over the width of the emission line , centered on the three strongest co(1 - 0 ) peaks separately ( table 1 ) . the strongest emission line in panel a of figure [ grid ] originates primarily from gas at the very center of the bcg , coincident with the peak in the x - ray , fuv , optical , and h@xmath7 emission .",
    "this morphology matches sc04 , with peaks to the northeast and southwest of the nucleus .",
    "the emission line at + 400 km s@xmath20 appears to originate from slightly larger radii ( consistent in position with uv peaks ) , although the signal - to - noise is insufficient to firmly establish the morphology of this gas .",
    "the cold gas appears to trace the morphology of the warm gas in the central region , with several 12@xmath22 peaks coincident with the extended h@xmath7 and far - uv emission .",
    "however , while the _ integrated _ co(1 - 0 ) emission is detected with high ( @xmath233@xmath22 ) significance , figure [ spatial ] demonstrates that significantly deeper data is required to carefully map out the morphology of the cold gas .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the second panel of figure [ edge ] compares the molecular gas mass to the _ classical _ cooling rate , ( dm / dt)@xmath33  @xmath34 , which is based on the x - ray luminosity .",
    "estimates of dm / dt based on this formula are typically orders of magnitude higher than the observed cooling rate from x - ray spectroscopy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that m@xmath25 is correlated with the classically - derived x - ray cooling rate , but that there is much less molecular gas than inferred by reasonable estimates of the cooling time ( @xmath410@xmath2  yr ) . indeed , when the entire cool core of a1795 is considered , the amount of h@xmath5 detected is @xmath610% of the amount which should have cooled in a gyr .",
    "however , if only the strongly - cooling regions are considered ( i.e. those which exhibit far - uv and h@xmath7 emission ) this fraction increases to @xmath430% .",
    "that is , if the observed molecular gas cooled in situ over the past gyr , it represents @xmath430% of the _ local _ expected classical cooling flow .",
    "this large fraction suggests that , when the other cooling byproducts are included , there may not be a significant discrepancy between the classical cooling estimate and the total mass of cooling byproducts _ on small scales_.    the apparent balance between the cooling rate and the amount of cooling byproducts is further demonstrated in figure [ dmdt_lit ] .",
    "we compile estimates of the cooling rate based on x - ray and euv spectroscopy from the literature @xcite , and find a mean of 27@xmath35 m@xmath3 yr@xmath20 .",
    "the large uncertainty reflects the variety of methods used .",
    "we show , as an upper limit , the estimate of the classical cooling rate in regions with evidence for multiphase ( h@xmath7 , co ) gas . as an approximate correction for projection ,",
    "we model the x - ray spectrum in this region with a two - temperature plasma and calculate the cooling rate from the lower - temperature component . in @xcite , we calculate the central cooling time ( 0.9 gyr ) based on a deprojected x - ray spectrum of the central 20  kpc , assuming @xmath36 @xmath4 10@xmath27@xmath37(k/10 kev cm@xmath14)@xmath39@xmath37(kt/5 kev)@xmath20 gyr , and show that both the central region and the cooling filaments have orders of magnitude shorter cooling times than the surrounding icm . assuming this cooling time of 0.9 gyr , figure [ dmdt_lit ] shows that the total cooling rate of 18.1 m@xmath3 yr@xmath20 , inferred by young stars ( 10.4 @xmath0 2 m@xmath3 yr@xmath20 ; * ? ? ?",

    "these estimates confirm earlier work which showed that the h@xmath7-emitting gas does not contribute appreciably to the total mass of cooling byproducts in perseus @xcite .",
    "this cooling estimate necessarily hinges on our assumptions of a 0.9 gyr cooling time and conservative reddening of e(b - v ) = 0.15 ( 50% of observed balmer reddening ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we show in figure [ dmdt_lit ] the uncertainty due to allowing a range of cooling times from 0.5 gyr ( dense filaments ) to 2.5 gyr ( diffuse gas in central 60 kpc ) , and two separate star formation estimates including one with an implicit reddening correction @xcite and without @xcite .",
    "this good agreement between i ) the classical , l@xmath40-derived , cooling rate and the spectroscopic cooling rate _ in the densest regions of the icm _ , and ii ) the spectroscopic cooling estimates and the amount of cooling byproducts , suggests that the cooling flow problem may be much less drastic than previously thought in these dense regions .",
    "we present carma observations of the cool core of abell  1795 at co(1 - 0 ) .",
    "we find significant amounts of cold molecular gas at clustercentric radii of 0 kpc ( 3.9 @xmath0 0.4 @xmath110@xmath2 m@xmath3 ) and 30 kpc ( 2.9 @xmath0 0.4 @xmath110@xmath2 m@xmath3 ) , and place an upper limit on the h@xmath5 mass at 60 kpc ( @xmath60.9 @xmath110@xmath2 m@xmath3 ) , assuming a galactic value of x@xmath24 .",
    "these co(1 - 0 ) peaks are coincident in both position and velocity with the warm , ionized filaments and the brightest star - forming regions .",
    "the large amount of cold molecular gas at large radius along the cooling filament implies that the icm is able to cool efficiently far - removed from the effects of the agn . in light of these new observations",
    ", we compare the icm cooling estimates to the mass of cooling byproducts and find agreement in the central 10  kpc and along the rapidly - cooling filaments .",
    "furthermore , we find that in these dense regions the local classical cooling rate is in good agreement with both the spectroscopic cooling rate and the cooling rate implied by the cooling byproducts .",
    "these results suggest that the cooling flow problem , at least in this system , stems from a lack of observable cooling in the more diffuse ( off - filament ) regions at radii larger than @xmath4 10 kpc . in the near future",
