    "<S> in the present work we study gut coleman - weinberg inflation with a nonminimal coupling to gravity . in this kind of model one </S>",
    "<S> usually finds that either the nonminimal coupling to gravity is large @xmath0 or the inflaton self - coupling is unnaturally small @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the model is in agreement with the recent results from planck for natural values of the couplings .    </S>",
    "<S> inflation  @xcite has become the standard paradigm for the early universe , because it solves some outstanding problems present in the standard hot big - bang cosmology , such as the flatness and horizon problems , the problem of unwanted relics , such as magnetic monopoles , and produces the cosmological fluctuations for the formation of the structure that we observe today . </S>",
    "<S> the spectacular cmb data , first from the wmap satellite  @xcite and recently from planck  @xcite , have strengthen the inflationary idea , since the observations indicate an _ almost _ scale - free spectrum of gaussian adiabatic density fluctuations , just as predicted by simple models of inflation . however , inflation is not a theory yet , as we do nt know how to integrate it with ideas from particle physics .    </S>",
    "<S> the brout - englert - higgs mechanism  @xcite in the framework of the standard model breaks electroweak symmetry , gives masses to the charged fermions and the massive gauge bosons , and predicts the existence of the higgs boson . </S>",
    "<S> the recent lhc discovery of the higgs boson  @xcite completed the particle spectrum predicted by the standard model , and indicates for the first time that fundamental scalar particles exist in nature . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is a natural thing to assume that inflation is driven by the higgs boson . </S>",
    "<S> although the higgs potential is not suitable for a viable inflationary model , the presence of a higgs non - minimal coupling to gravity can change things to the better . </S>",
    "<S> a large value of the non - minimal coupling @xmath2 is required , and given the uncertainties in the top quark mass and the strong coupling constant the model is still allowed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> sadly , that large value of @xmath3 questions the validity of the scenario in the sm higgs inflation , as the inflationary scale exceeds the effective ultraviolet cut - off scale  @xcite .    as it was realized long ago </S>",
    "<S> , radiative corrections can be the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the coleman - weinberg mechanism can not work in the standard model due to the large value of the top yukawa coupling , but it can work in models beyond the standard model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is an interesting possibility given the higgs naturalness problem , in the following sense . </S>",
    "<S> if heavy particles are coupled to the higgs boson , like in gut models , then the higgs receives large radiative corrections that bring its mass close to the gut mass scale . </S>",
    "<S> supersymmetry at the tev scale can solve the problem , but given the severe experimental constraints on the masses of the superpartners , it was proposed recently the flatland scenario  @xcite , according to which electroweak symmetry is broken radiatively a la coleman - weinberg in the infrared region starting from a flat scalar potential in the ultraviolet region .    </S>",
    "<S> regarding inflation , the coleman - weinberg type of potential is a simple and well motivated one , since it naturally arises when loop corrections are taken into account , and it is typical for the new inflation scenario  @xcite where inflation takes place near the maximum . </S>",
    "<S> recently it has been studied in  @xcite in a b - l extension of the standard model , and a few years ago in  @xcite in a gut inflationary model . as shown in  @xcite in the context of the effective theory of inflation , cosmic microwave background together with large scale structure data </S>",
    "<S> prefer double - well inflaton potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the 2013 planck data confirmed this result , and not surprisingly the coleman - weinberg potential considered here belongs to this class , and succeeds to reproduce the @xmath4 value and the r bound from the 2013 planck release . </S>",
    "<S> however , in  @xcite the inflaton was minimally coupled to gravity . setting @xmath5 , although it is a popular choice , is often unacceptable as was pointed out in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> non - minimal couplings are generated by quantum corrections even if they are absent in the classical action  @xcite , and as a matter of fact the coupling is required if the scalar field theory is to be renormalizable in a classical gravitational background  @xcite . for early works on non - minimal </S>",
    "<S> inflation see for example  @xcite and references therein .    </S>",
    "<S> in the present brief report we imagine a scenario where inflation is driven by the scalar sector of some particle physics model beyond the standard model in which electroweak symmetry breaking takes place radiatively a la coleman and weinberg . since the scale of inflation is close to the gut scale </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a gut model rather than a low energy one , and we also allow for a non - vanishing non - minimal coupling , as required by the quantum corrections already needed to give rise to the coleman - weinberg type of the inflaton potential . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the model is viable as it is in agreement with the recent data from planck , and even more importantly for natural values of the parameters of the model .    </S>",
    "<S> we start defining the model by the action @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the non - minimal coupling and @xmath8 with a coleman - weinberg type of potential of the standard form  @xcite @xmath9 where a is related to the inflaton quartic self - coupling  @xcite , and m is the inflaton vacuum expectation value ( vev ) at the minimum , @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum energy density at the origin is given by the constant term @xmath11 so that @xmath12 , and the shape of the potential can be seen in figure  1 , and the inflaton mass is given by @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> at this point we stress the fact that the coleman - weinberg potential considered in the present work is the standard one obtained from one - loop corrections in minkowski spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> the one - loop corrections in de sitter spacetime ( which approximates an inflationary background ) lead to a very different effective potential as shown in  @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in summary , in this brief report we have considered a gut inflationary model where inflation is driven by the scalar sector of the model with a coleman - weinberg type of potential for the inflaton and a non - minimal coupling of the inflaton to gravity . </S>",
    "<S> as is known , at tree level the @xmath14 potential can not trigger electroweak symmetry breaking , and in addition the corresponding chaotic inflationary model @xmath15 is ruled out by the wmap and planck data . </S>",
    "<S> however , quantum loop corrections modify the inflaton potential and at the same time generate the non - minimal coupling term . the model is characterized by two dimensionless parameters , namely the non - minimal coupling @xmath7 and the inflaton quartic self - coupling @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the model leads to predictions in agreement with the 95 per cent cl contours in the r-@xmath4 plane for natural values of the parameters of the model , both for @xmath7 and @xmath16 of the order of @xmath17 . </S>"
