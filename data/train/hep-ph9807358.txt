    "parton distributions were first introduced by feynman as the phenomenological quantities describing the properties of the nucleon manifest in high - energy scattering@xcite .",
    "when a nucleon travels near the speed of light , it can be viewed as consisting of a beam of non - interacting partons that are massless and collinear .",
    "parton distributions are the densities of partons as a function of the fraction @xmath0 of the nucleon momentum they carry . with the advent of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) ,",
    "feynman s parton model , modulo logarithms , can be justified in a rigorous field theoretical approach @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , parton distributions can be expressed as the matrix elements of the bilocal light - ray operators in the ground state of the nucleon @xcite . only in the light - like gauge , @xmath1 , and light - cone quantization ,",
    "does their physical interpretation become apparent .",
    "when studying the physics of parton distributions themselves , one of course can no longer regard the nucleon as consisting of free partons .",
    "calculating these distributions requires a detailed knowledge of the nucleon wave function in quark and gluon degrees of freedom , and undoubtedly is one of the most challenging problems in nonperturbative qcd . at present , the only fundamental approach we know is the lattice qcd method @xcite . on the phenomenological side , however , the unpolarized parton distributions have been extracted with good precision from various high - energy scattering data taken in the last thirty years @xcite .",
    "the empirical parton distributions not only provide the necessary input for calculating high - energy scattering cross sections , e.g. , of top - quark production , but also contain valuable information about how the nucleon is made of its constituents .    recently , there has been much theoretical activity surrounding the so - called off - forward parton ( or non - forward , off - diagonal ) distributions ( ofpd s ) .",
    "the new distributions generalize those introduced by feynman : they characterize certain properties of the nucleon exhibited in a class of high - energy scattering ; they reflect the low - energy internal structure of the particle . however , there are also important differences between the off - forward and forward distributions .",
    "the ofpd s in general can not be regarded as particle densities , but rather their physical interpretation is given in terms of probability amplitude .",
    "as we shall see , they do have simple physical significance in light - cone coordinates ( or the infinite momentum frame ) .",
    "the most natural appearance of the ofpd s is in _ non - forward _ high - energy processes . as far as we know ,",
    "such processes were first considered by watanabe @xcite and by bartels and m. loewe @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a general virtual - photon compton scattering off a nucleon target was studied in operator product expansion ( ope ) , an integral representation of the amplitude was obtained , and the off - forward matrix elements of twist - two operators were defined .",
    "the study , however , mentioned little about physical motivations and the practicality of the process ; in particular , significance of the integral representation was obscure . in ref .",
    "@xcite , diffractive production of @xmath2 and photons was studied in perturbative qcd and the properties of the non - diagonal gluon ladder were investigated . however , no notion of an off - forward distribution of the nucleon target was apparent in the paper . following @xcite , a set of off - forward evolution kernels were presented by gribov , levin , and ryskin @xcite .",
    "these kernels were considered as those for the scattering amplitude .",
    "the role of off - forward distributions in hard diffractive processes had remained obscured in relatively recent studies . in ref .",
    "@xcite , diffractive electroproduction of @xmath3 was analyzed by ryskin in the small @xmath0 region .",
    "the production amplitude was related to the usual feynman gluon distribution .",
    "the off - forwardness was taken into account by a phenomenological form factor . in refs .",
    "@xcite , ryskin s analysis was generalized to light vector - meson production in which the meson structure is accounted for by the leading - twist light - cone wave function .",
    "to the author s knowledge , one of first examples of ofpd s was introduced by dittes et al .",
    "@xcite , and was called `` interpolating function . ''",
    "ironically , the main motivation for introducing such an object was not from studying any off - forward process ; rather , it was considered as an example of the physical quantities whose evolution kernel interpolates between the two well - known cases : the dglap and erbl evolutions @xcite .",
    "a serious study of the ofpd in a physical process was made by d. mller et al .",
    "@xcite in which they showed that it contributes to the general two virtual - photon compton scattering the same process considered earlier by watanabe .",
    "they also derived the evolution equations for the ofpd .",
    "note that in ref .",
    "@xcite a general off - forward amplitude ( or single - particle green s function ) was introduced in studying hadron helicity flip in hard scattering . however , because the correlation of two quark fields in the object is off the light cone , it does not have a simple parton interpretation as the ofpd s do .",
    "the recent wave of interest in the ofpd s was generated from two new developments .",
    "the first development is the recognition of the importance of the ofpd s in describing the internal structure of the nucleon @xcite . in studying the spin structure",
    ", it was found that the fractions of the nucleon spin carried by quarks and gluons can be determined by the form factors of the corresponding energy - momentum tensors .",
    "these form factors can be obtained from the moments of the ofpd s which were independently introduced in @xcite . in the same paper , deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs )",
    "was proposed as a practical means to measure the ofpd s . in dvcs ,",
    "a highly virtual photon scatters off a quark in a nucleon target , which then emits a real photon and returns to form a recoil nucleon .",
    "although the two - photon process studied earlier by watanabe and mller et al .",
    "contains dvcs as its special kinematic limit , the latter has important experimental advantages and a special theoretical status . indeed , dvcs is more delicate to treat theoretically because of an extra light - like vector among the external momenta .",
    "the second development is the realization that hard diffractive electroproduction of vector mesons requires the use of ofpd s @xcite .",
    "the first serious studies in this direction were made by radyushkin @xcite , hoodbhoy @xcite , and collins et al .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an off - forward gluon distribution - most important in the low @xmath0 region - was introduced and used to calculate vector meson production in deep - inelastic electron scattering .",
    "the result is free of the assumptions made in ref .",
    "@xcite about the dominance of the absorptive contribution and the use of the forward gluon distribution .",
    "hoodbhoy @xcite used the off - forward gluon distribution to calculate heavy quarkonium production investigated earlier by ryskin @xcite .",
    "he obtained a similar result as radyushkin s . in a comprehensive paper , collins , frankfurt , and",
    "strikman showed that a factorization theorem exists for general hard diffractive meson production in deep - inelastic scattering @xcite .",
    "the factorization theorem explicitly involves the ofpd s .",
    "recently , many works have been produced in studying off - forward parton distributions , deeply virtual compton scattering , and diffractive vector meson production .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to review these interesting developments . in section",
    "ii , off - forward distributions are introduced from different perspectives and various definitions in the literature are compared . in section iii , we make a digression to discuss the spin structure of the nucleon . the role of the ofpd s in this interesting subject is exposed . in section iv , we summarize our present knowledge about the ofpd s at hadron mass scales and their evolution to high - energy scales . in section",
    "v , we consider processes in which the ofpd s may actually be measured : deeply virtual compton scattering and hard diffractive vector - meson production .",
    "section vi contains the summary and outlook .",
    "since the off - forward distributions contain rich information about the nucleon structure , it is instructive to examine their definitions and interpretations from different angles . in this section",
    ", we will first introduce the off - forward distributions from the form factors of twist - two operators and then we explore their significance in light - cone coordinates .",
    "finally we compare the ofpd s with other equivalent definitions in the literature .      from the point view of the low - energy nucleon structure , it is perhaps most interesting to consider the off - forward distributions as the generating functions for the form factors of the so - called twist - two operators .",
    "recall that the matrix elements of the electromagnetic current in the equal momentum states are entirely determined by symmetry , whereas those in the unequal momentum states define the ( dirac and pauli ) form factors which contain such interesting information as charge radius and magnetic moment of the nucleon .",
    "the following tower of twist - two operators represents a generalization of the electromagnetic current @xmath4 where all indices are symmetrized and traceless ( indicated by @xmath5 ) and @xmath6 technically , these operators transform like @xmath7 under lorentz transformations .",
    "our interest in such operators is not accidental .",
    "they appear , for instance , in the operator production expansion of the two electromangetic currents in deep - inelastic scattering @xcite .",
    "thus although these generalized currents do not couple directly to any known fundamental interactions , they can nonetheless be studied indirectly in hard scattering processes .    since the operators for @xmath8 are not related to any symmetry in the qcd lagrangian",
    ", their matrix elements between the equal momentum states , @xmath9 contain valuable dynamical information about the internal structure of the nucleon . in this paper",
    ", we use the covariant normalization @xmath10 for the nucleon state .",
    "the @xmath11 dependence of the above matrix elements signifies the dependence on renormalization scale and scheme @xcite .",
    "the quark distribution @xmath12 introduced by feynman has a simple connection to the above matrix elements : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is chosen to have support in @xmath15 . for @xmath16 , @xmath12 is the just density of quarks which carry the @xmath0 fraction of the parent nucleon momentum .",
    "the density of antiquarks is customarily denoted as @xmath17 , which in the above notation is @xmath18 @xcite .    just like the form factors of the electromagnetic current ,",
    "additional information about nucleon structure can be found in the form factors of the twist - two operators when the matrix elements are taken between the states of unequal momenta .",
    "using lorentz symmetry and parity and time reversal invariance , one can write down all possible form factors of the spin-@xmath19 operator @xmath20 }         a_{qn,2i}(t ) \\delta^{\\mu_2}\\cdots \\delta^{\\mu_{2i+1 } }         \\overline{p}^{\\mu_{2i+2}}\\cdots        \\overline{p}^{\\mu_n ) }   \\nonumber \\\\       & &   + ~   { \\overline u}(p'){\\sigma^{(\\mu_1\\alpha }        i\\delta_\\alpha \\over 2m}u(p )    \\sum_{i=0}^{[{n-1\\over 2 } ] }       b_{qn,2i}(t ) \\delta^{\\mu_2}\\cdots \\delta^{\\mu_{2i+1 } }         \\overline{p}^{\\mu_{2i+2}}\\cdots      \\overline{p}^{\\mu_n ) } \\nonumber \\\\       & &   + ~ c_{qn}(t ) ~{\\rm mod}(n+1,2)~{1\\over m}\\bar u(p ' ) u(p )       \\delta^{(\\mu_1 } \\cdots \\delta^{\\mu_n ) } \\ ,   \\label{form}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the dirac spinors and @xmath23 is 1 when @xmath19 even , 0 when @xmath19 odd .",
    "the four - momentum transfer is denoted by @xmath24 and its invariant by @xmath25 .",
    "the average nucleon momentum @xmath26 is also a useful variable . for @xmath27 ,",
    "even or odd , there are @xmath28 form factors .",
    "@xmath29 is present only when @xmath19 is even .",
    "as the forward matrix elements @xmath30 , the above form factors can be used to define a new type of parton distributions _ off - forward distributions_. to accomplish this , we introduce a light - like vector @xmath31 , which is conjugate to @xmath32 in the sense that @xmath33 .",
    "write @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is another light - like vector .",
    "contracting both sides of eq .",
    "( [ form ] ) with @xmath37 , we have @xmath38 where @xmath39 }       a_{qn,2i}(t ) ( -2\\xi)^{2i } + { \\rm mod}(n+1,2)~ c_{qn}(t ) ( -2\\xi)^n \\ , \\nonumber \\\\     e_{qn } ( \\xi , t ) & = & \\sum_{i=0}^{[{n-1\\over 2 } ] }       b_{qn,2i}(t ) ( -2\\xi)^{2i } - { \\rm mod}(n+1,2)~ c_{qn}(t ) ( -2\\xi)^n \\ .   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have defined a new variable @xmath40 . clearly , the @xmath41 dependence of @xmath42 and @xmath43 helps to distinguish among the different form factors of the same operator .",
    "now one can introduce the off - forward parton distributions ( ofpd s ) @xmath44 and @xmath45 through their moments @xmath46 since all form factors are real , the new distributions are consequently real .",
    "moreover , because of time - reversal and hermiticity , they are _ even _ functions of @xmath41 . for simplicity ,",
    "we have not shown here the renormalization scale dependence .",
    "frequently we will also omit the @xmath47 dependence .",
    "the new distributions are more complicated than the feynman parton distributions because of their dependence on the momentum transfer @xmath48 . as such ,",
    "the ofpd s contain two more scalar variables besides the feynman variable @xmath0 .",
    "the variable @xmath47 is the usual @xmath47-channel invariant which is always present in a form factor .",
    "the @xmath41 variable is a natural product of marrying the concepts of the feynman distribution and form factor : the former requires the presence of a prefered momentum @xmath49 along which the partons are predominantly moving and the latter requires a four - momentum transfer @xmath48 ; @xmath41 is just a scalar product of the two momenta .",
    "some insights about the dependence of the ofpd s on these two extra variables will be offered later in section iv.a .    in qcd , there are five additional towers of twist - two operators besides that in eq .",
    "( [ o1 ] ) : @xmath50 the corresponding off - forward distributions can be labelled by @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the physical significance of parton distributions in high - energy processes is apparent only in light - cone coordinates and light - cone gauge . to see this , we sum up all the local twist - two operators into a light - cone bilocal operator and express the parton distributions in terms of the latter , @xmath61 the light - cone bilocal operator ( or light - ray operator ) arises frequently in hard scattering processes in which partons propagate along the light - cone .",
    "in fact , the taylor - expansion of this operator along the light - cone leads us immediately to the twist - two operators considered in the last subsection .",
    "the parton distributions are most naturally defined in terms of the matrix elements of the bilocal operator . in this context , the feynman @xmath0 is just the fourier variable of the light - cone distance .",
    "the lorentz structures in the second line in the above equation are independent and complete .    in ordinary coodinates ,",
    "the correlation of two quark fields in the light - ray operator is in both space and time . as such",
    ", the physical interpretation is quite complicated .",
    "however , in light - cone coordinates , the physical content of the bilocal operator becomes transparent . to see this ,",

    "[ fig1 ]    now we can look at the physical content of the off - forward distributions in the light - cone coordinates and gauge .",

    "( [ string ] ) , we have @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a volume factor .",
    "the distribution has different physical interpretations in the three different regions . in the region @xmath81 , it is the amplitude for taking a quark of momentum @xmath82 out of the nucleon , changing its momentum to @xmath83 , and inserting it back to form a recoiled nucleon . in the region @xmath84 , it is the amplitude for taking out a quark and antiquark pair with momentum @xmath85 . finally ,",
    "in the region @xmath86 , we have the same situation as in the first , except the quark is replaced by an antiquark .",

    "it is interesting from the point of view of parametrizing the momentum flow out of a hadron vertex in a @xmath41-independent way .",
    "however , the physics of a double distribution is equivalent to that of the corresponding off - forward distribution .",
    "one of the principal motivations for studying off - forward distributions is that they provide a new class of observables for the internal structure of the nucleon .",

    ", the approach has not yet been developed to a degree of sophistication so that one can reliably calculate fundamental observables with respectable precisions .",
    "therefore , any experimental information on the structure of the nucleon is valuable in helping to understand how nature constructed this particle of extreme importance to our existence .    since gell - mann and zweig s quark model",
    ", many nucleon models have been proposed to correlate the experimental data from low and high energy probes .",
    "although these models are not precisely qcd , they have been quite successful phenomenologically .",
    "however , the ultimate question confronting models is how the degrees of freedom used in them are related to those in qcd .",
    "this question is of high importance because experimental probes do not couple to model degrees of freedom . in practice ,",
    "simple assumptions have been used in comparing model predictions and data , e.g. , the constituent quarks are identified as qcd quarks at low - energy scales although a precise notation of the latter is unclear .",
    "these assumptions have been seriously challenged in 1987 when the european muon collaboration ( emc ) measured , with an unprecedented precision , the proton s spin - dependent structure function @xmath125 in polarized deep - inelastic scattering . combining their data with the hyperon beta decay rates , augmented with the assumption of the flavor su(3 ) symmetry , emc extracted the fraction of the nucleon spin carried in the spin of quarks : @xmath126 this result is in flat contradiction with the cherished quark model prediction @xmath127 .",

    "for instance , lattice qcd calculations have produced numbers close to the emc result @xcite , although the systematic effects of quenched approximation , finite lattice sizes , and large quark masses remain uncertain . despite these",
    ", more fundamental approaches have not yet offered a complete picture about the spin structure of the nucleon . as to the naive quark model prediction",
    ", the key question is what has been alluded to abovel : namely , whether the quark model result can be directly compared with the experimental data , or whether the constituent quarks are the same as the qcd quarks probed in high - energy scattering .",

    "more recently , progress has been made in attempting to understand how qcd builds up the nucleon spin .",
    "the progress potentially has an important impact on other theoretical studies , and ultimately on our basic knowledge of the internal structure of the nucleon . on the one hand",

    "the models are yet to be extended to including gluon degrees of freedom which are known to be important even at low energy scales .",
    "indeed , a vanishing helicity - flip gluon distribution at low - energy scales will remain zero at other scales because it has no mixing with any quark distribution .",
    "a number of rigorous constraints discussed in section iv.a can be helpful in modelling : apart from the special limits and @xmath261 moments , there exist useful upper bounds for the ofpd s .",
    "there have been many studies in perturbative evolution . at the leading - logarithmic level ,",
    "evolution equations now have been obtained for all leading - twist ofpd s . at",
    "next - to - leading order , one needs two - loop anomalous dimensions which exist only for the spin - independent non - singlet operators @xcite .",
    "calculations of additional two - loop anomalous dimensions will be needed as data on the ofpd s become available .",
    "recent works of mller and belitsky illustrate the power of exploiting the anomalous conformal symmetry to obtain these anomalous dimensions @xcite .",
    "numerical studies of evolution effects have just begun .",
    "qualitatively we can understand the evolution effects from its asymptotic behavior .",
    "quantitatively , one needs to establish high - precision , high - speed evolution codes which allow efficient data fitting in the future .",
    "the leading - order cross sections for dvcs and meson production can be found in the literature .",
    "for dvcs , the cross section has also been computed to the next - to - leading order in @xmath262 . a similar study for meson production",
    "can be made , and will be necessary once precision data become available .",
    "higher - twist effects are important at low @xmath263 and must be    investigated thoroughly . generally speaking , they are more complex to study than that in deep - inelastic scattering because of the extra photon or meson , and the extra soft scale @xmath47 .",
    "additional processes may be explored to probe the ofpd s , including ones in which the final state baryon may contain strange or heavy flavors .",
    "polarization observables need to be seriously investigated .",
    "a solid experimental confirmation of the scattering mechanisms involving the ofpd s is itself very significant .",
    "it involves testing scaling relations and selection rules .",
    "finally , we notice that the ofpd s are functions of multi - variables . as such",
    ", it would be difficult to get a complete picture of them in a short time period and in a single type of experiments .",
    "moreover , experimental cross sections can not be used to extract the distributions directly ; they usually involve integrals over parton momenta .",
    "therefore , it will be necessary to parametrize the ofpd s and fit the parameters to data . in finding appropriate ways to make parametrizations and fits",
    ", model studies will play important role , unless of course lattice calculations can make a significant breakthrough in the near future .    *",
    "note added : * after this paper was submitted for publication , the author has noticed some new works in the literature which are relevant to the subject of this paper . in ref .",
