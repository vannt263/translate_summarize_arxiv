    "multi - wavelength observations of nearby star - forming regions have shown that the vast majority of pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars are either accreting classical t tauri stars ( cttss ) with excess emission extending all the way from the near - ir to the millimeter or , more evolved , non - accreting , weak - line t tauri stars ( wttss ) with bare stellar photospheres .",
    "the fact that very few objects lacking near - ir excess show mid - ir or ( sub)millimeter excess emission implies that , once the inner disk dissipates , the entire primordial disk disappears very rapidly ( wolk @xmath8 walter 1996 ; andrews @xmath8 williams 2005,2007 ; cieza et al .",
    "the few objects that are caught in the short transition between typical cttss and disk - less wttss usually have optically thin or non - existent inner disks and optically thick outer disks ( i.e. , they have reduced opacity in the inner regions of the disk ) .",
    "the reduced opacity in the inner disk is the defining characteristic of the so called transition disks .",
    "the precise definitions of what constitutes a transition object found in the disk evolution literature are , however , far from homogeneous ( see evans et al .",
    "2009 for a detailed description of the transition disk nomenclature ) .",
    "transition disks have been defined as objects with no detectable near - ir excess , steep slopes in the mid - ir , and large far - ir excesses ( e.g. , muzerolle et al . 2006 , sicilia - aguilar et al .",
    "2006a ) this definition has been relaxed by some authors ( e.g. , brown et al .",
    "2007 , cieza et al . 2008 ) to include objects with small , but still detectable , near - ir excesses .",
    "transition disks have also been more broadly defined in terms of a significant decrement relative to the taurus median spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at any or all wavelengths ( e.g. , najita et al . 2007 ) .",
    "this broad definition is the closest one to the criteria we adopt to select our sample ( see   [ selection ] ) .",
    "even though , according to our definition , many transition disks have inner disks with non - zero opacity , we refer to their regions of low opacity as the  inner opacity hole . \"",
    "recent submillimeter studies provide dramatic support for the presence of inner opacity holes inferred from the sed modeling of transition disks .",
    "high resolution submillimeter continuum images of objects such as lkh@xmath9 330 ( brown et al .",
    "2008 ) and gm tau ( hughes et al . 2009 ) show sharp inner holes tens of au in radius and lend confidence to the standard interpretation of transition disk seds .    one of the most intriguing results from transition disk studies has been the great diversity of sed morphologies revealed by the _",
    "spitzer _ space telescope . in an attempt to describe distinct classes of transition disks ,",
    "several names have recently emerged in the literature ( evans et al .",
    "these new names include : anemic disks , flat disks , or homologously depleted disks to describe objects whose observed seds are significantly below the median of the ctts population at all ir wavelengths ( lada et al .",
    "2006 , currie et al .",
    "these new names also include cold disks , objects with little or no near - ir excesses whose seds raise very steeply in the mid - ir ( brown et al . 2007 ) , and pre - transitional disks , disks with evidence for an optically - thin gap separating optically - thick inner and outer disk components ( espaillat et al . 2008 ) .",
    "studying the diverse population of transition disks is key for understanding circumstellar disk evolution as much of the diversity of their sed morphologies is likely to arise from different physical processes dominating the evolution of different disks .",
    "disk evolution processes include : viscous accretion ( hartmann et al . 1998 ) , photoevaporation ( alexander et al . , 2006 ) , the magnetorotational instability ( chiang @xmath8 murray - clay , 2007 ) , grain growth and dust settling ( dominik @xmath8 dullemond , 2008 ) , planet formation ( lissauer , 2003 ; boss et al .",
    "2000 ) , and dynamical interactions between the disk and stellar or substellar companions ( artymowicz @xmath8 lubow , 1994 ) . understanding the relative importance of these physical processes in disk evolution and their connection to the different classes of transition disks is currently one of the main challenges of the disk evolution field .",
    "also , even though transition disks are rare , it is likely that all circumstellar disks go through a short transition disk stage ( as defined by their seds ) at some point of their evolution .",
    "this is so because observations show that an ir excess at a given wavelength is _ always _ accompanied by an excess at longer wavelengths ( the converse is not true as attested by the very existence of transition disks ) .",
    "this implies that , unless some disks manage to lose the near- , mid- and far - ir excess at _ exactly _ the same time , the near - ir excess _ always _",
    "dissipates before the mid - ir and far - ir excess do .",
    "since no known process is expected to remove the circumtellar dust at all radii simultaneously , it is reasonable to conclude that transition disks represent a common ( if not unavoidable ) phase in the evolution of a circumstellar disk .",
    "at least four different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the opacity holes of transition disks : giant planet formation , grain growth , photoevaporation , and tidal truncation in close binaries . however , since all these processes can in principle result in similar ir seds , additional observational constraints are necessary to distinguish among them .",
    "as discussed by najita et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , cieza ( 2008 ) , and alexander ( 2008 ) , disk masses , accretion rates , and multiplicity information are particularly useful to distinguish between the different mechanisms that are likely to produce the inner holes in transition disks .",
    "a vivid example of the need for these kind of data is the famous disk around coku tau/4 . since its sharp inner hole was discovered by _",
    "( forrest et al . 2004 ) , its origin has been a matter of great debate .",
    "the hole was initially modeled to be carved by a giant planet ( quillen et al .",
    "2004 ) , but najita et al .",
    "( 2007 ) argued that the low mass and low accretion rate of the coku tau/4 disk are more consistent with photoevaporation than with a planet formation scenario .",
    "more recently , coku tau/4 has has been shown to be a close binary star system with a 8 au projected separation , rendering its disk a circumbinary one ( ireland @xmath8 kraus 2008 ) .",
    "since the number of well characterized transition disks is still in the tens , most studies so far have focused on the modeling of individual objects such as tw hydra , ( calvet et al .",
    "2004 ) , gm aur and dm tau ( calvet et al . 2005 ) , lkh@xmath9 330 ( brown et al .",

    ", few studies have discussed the properties of transition disks as a group ( e.g. , najita et al .",
    "2007 ; cieza et al .",
    "these papers studied relatively small samples , suffer from different selection biases , and arrived , not too surprisingly , at very different conclusions .",
    "najita et al .",
    "( 2007 ) studied a sample of 12 transition objects in taurus and found that they have stellar accretion rates @xmath010 times lower and a median disk mass ( @xmath025 m@xmath2 ) that is @xmath04 times larger than the rest of the disks in taurus .",
    "they argue that most of the transition disks in their sample are consistent with the planet formation scenario .",
    "the disk masses found by najita et al .",
    "are in stark contrast to the results from the sma study of 26 transition disks from cieza et al .",
    "they observed mostly wttss disks and found that _ all _ of them have very low masses @xmath11 - 3 m@xmath2 suggesting that their inner holes were more likely due to photoevaporation , instead of the formation of jovian planets .",
    "this discrepancy can probably be traced back to the different sample selection criteria as najita et al .",
    "studied mostly cttss , while cieza et al .",
    "studied mostly wttss ( see   [ m_a_sec ] )",
    ". a much larger and unbiased sample of transition disks is needed to quantify the importance of multiplicity , photoevaporation , grain growth , and planet formation on the evolution of circumstellar disks .",
    "this paper is the first part of a series from an ongoing project aiming to characterize over 100 _ spitzer_-selected transition disks located in nearby star - forming regions .",
    "here we present millimeter wavelength photometry ( from the sma and the cso ) , high - resolution optical spectroscopy ( from the clay , cfht , and du pont telescopes ) , and adaptive optics near - infrared imaging ( from the vlt ) for a sample of 26 _ spitzer_-selected transition circumstellar disks located in the ophiuchus molecular cloud .",
    "we use these new ground - based data to estimate the disk mass , accretion rate , and multiplicity for each object in our sample in order to investigate the mechanisms potentially responsible for their inner opacity holes .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "our sample selection criteria are presented in   2 , while our observations and data reduction techniques are described in   3 .",
    "we present our results on disk masses , accretion rates , and multiplicity in   4 . in   5 , we discuss the properties of our transition disk sample and compare them to those of non - transition objects .",
    "we also discuss the likely origins of the inner holes of individual targets and the implications of our results for disk evolution .",
    "finally , a summary of our results and conclusions is presented in ",

    "these ysoc are objects with small or no near - ir excess ( see figure  [ sample_sel ] ) .",
    "the lack of a [ 3.6 ] - [ 4.5 ] color excess in our targets is inconsistent with an optically thick disk extending inward to the dust sublimation radius , and therefore indicates the presence of an inner opacity hole .",

    "( 2009 ) , this result can be understood in terms of the effect binaries have on circumstellar disks lifetimes via the tidal truncation of the _ outer _ disk .",
    "for instance , a binary system with a 30 au separation is expected to initially have individual disks that are @xmath010 - 15 au in radius .",
    "given that the viscous timescale is roughly proportional to the size of the disk , such small disks are likely to have very small accretion lifetimes , smaller than the age of the sample . for systems with binary separations",
    "much smaller than the size of a typical disk , the outer disk can survive in the form of a circumbinary disk , with a tidally truncated inner hole with a radius @xmath02@xmath20 the orbital separation ( artymowicz @xmath8 lubow , 1994 ) .",
    "such systems could be classified as transition disks based on their seds .",
    "we do not see an increased incidence of binaries with separations in the @xmath08 - 20 au range , the range where we are sensitive to companions that could in principle carve the inferred inner holes .",
    "in fact , the incidence of binaries in this separation range is lower for our transition disks than it is for the samples of both non - transition disks and disk - less stars .",
    "this suggests that stellar companions at 8 - 20 au separations are _ not _",
    "responsible for a large fraction of the transition disk population .",
    "given the size of our transition disk sample , however , this result carries little statistical weight , and should be considered only a hint . according to a ks test , the distribution of binaries separations of transition objects is indistinguishable from that of both non - transition disks ( p = 28@xmath10 ) and disk - less stars ( p = 12@xmath10 ) . on the other hand , the fact that 2 of our transition disk targets have previously known companions at sub - au separations suggests that circumbinary disks around very tight systems ( e.g. , r @xmath24 1 - 5 au ) could indeed represent an important component of the transition disk population .",
    "unfortunately , the presence of tight companions ( r @xmath24 8 au ) remains completely unconstrained for most of our sample .",
    "a complementary radial velocity survey to find the tightest companions is highly desirable to firmly establish the fraction of transition disks that could be accounted for by close binaries .",

    "2006 ) , extreme uv photons , originating in the stellar chromosphere , ionize and heat the circumstellar hydrogen .",
    "beyond some critical radius , the thermal velocity of the ionized hydrogen exceeds its escape velocity and the material is lost as a wind . at early stages in the evolution of the disk , the accretion rate across the disk dominates over the evaporation rate , and the disk undergoes standard viscous evolution . later on , as the accretion rate drops to the level of the photoevaporation rate , the outer disk is no longer able to resupply the inner disk with material , the inner disk drains on a viscous timescale , and an inner hole is formed .",
    "once an inner hole has formed , the entire disk dissipates very rapidly from the inside out as a consequence of the direct irradiation of the disk s inner edge . thus , transition disks created by photoevaporation are expected to have relatively low masses ( m@xmath60 @xmath1 @xmath61 ) and negligible accretion ( @xmath110@xmath62 m@xmath5yr@xmath6 ) .",

    "sharp inner holes could also arise from dynamical interactions between the disk and large bodies within it .",

    "coku tau/4 is perhaps the most extreme example of this scenario .",
    "it is a 8 au separation , equal - mass , binary system ( ireland & kraus , 2008 ) resulting on a @xmath46 value of @xmath02 . just like targets # 5 , 12 , and 19",
    ", coku tau/4 lacks accretion and has a very low disk mass ( najita et al .",
    "2007 ) , and is consequently also susceptible to photoevaporation .",
    "our vlt - ao observations reveal no stellar companion within @xmath08 au of targets # 5 , 12 , or 19 . however , target # 12 is already known to be very tight binary ( r @xmath24 1 au ) , and the presence of stellar ( or planetary mass ) companions remains completely unconstrained for targets # 5 and 19 .",
    "photoevaporation provides a natural mechanism for objects to transition from the primordial to the debris disk stage .",
    "once accretion stops , photoevaporation is capable of removing the remaining gas in a very short ( @xmath63 myr ) timescale ( alexander et al .",
    "2006 ) . as the gas in the disk photoevaporates",
    ", it is likely to carry with it the smallest grains present in the disk .",
    "what is left represents the initial conditions of a debris disk : a gas poor disk with large grains , planetesmals and/or planets .",
    "the very short photoevaporation timescale implies that some of the systems shown in figure  [ sed_non_acc ] could already be in a debris disk stage .",
    "in fact , the 4 non - accreting objects with l@xmath48/l@xmath35 @xmath1 10@xmath7 have properties that are indistinguishable from those of young debris disks like au mic and gj 182 ( liu et al .",
    "these 4 objects are # 12 , 20 , 23 , and 25 . these objects might have already formed planets or might be in a multiple system ( like target # 12 is ) . either way , most of the circumstellar gas and dust has already been depleted , and what we are currently observing could be the initial architectures of different debris systems , now subjected to processes such as dynamical interactions , the poynting  robertson effect and radiation pressure .",
    "the rest of the non accreting objects , # 5 , 9 , 13 , 19 , and 24 , have l@xmath48/l@xmath35 @xmath11 10@xmath7 and could be in the process of being photoevaporated .",
    "circumbinary disks are expected to be tidally truncated and have inner holes with a radius @xmath02@xmath20 the orbital separation ( artymowicz @xmath8 lubow , 1994 ) .",
    "it is believed that most pms stars are in multiple systems ( ratzka et al . 2005 ) with the same semi - major axis distribution as ms solar - type stars ( e.g. , a lognormal distribution centered at @xmath028 au ) . as a result ,",
    "@xmath030@xmath10 of all ophiuchus binaries are expected to have separations in the @xmath01 - 20 au range .",
    "_ if the primodial disk has survived in such systems _ , it is likely to be in the form of a circumbinary disk with tidally truncated inner holes up to 40 au in radius .",
    "these close binary systems could hence be classified as transition disks based on their ir seds .",
    "four of our targets have companions close enough to suspect they could be responsible for the observed hole , namely sources # 12 , 27 , 24 , and 23 , in increasing order of projected separation .",
    "source # 12 is a binary with a projected separation of @xmath00.6 au and @xmath64= 8.0 @xmath13 m , which implies the disk must be a circumbinary one .",
    "however , given the long @xmath45 wavelength and tightness of the binary system , it seems unlikely that the present size of the inner hole is directly connected to the presence of the stellar companion .",
    "source # 27 is triple system with projected separations of @xmath00.3 au and 41 au and @xmath45 = 4.5 @xmath13 m .",
    "the ir excess could originate at a circumbinary disk around the tight components of the system or at a circumstellar disk around the wide component .",
    "target # 24 is also a triple system with projected separations of @xmath07 and 105 au and @xmath45 = 5.8 @xmath13 m .",
    "the ir excess could also in principle originate at a circumbinary disk around the tight components of the system . however , a circumprimary disk around source # 24-a is an equally likely possibility .",
    "target # 23 is a @xmath00.19@xmath18 ( or 24 au ) separation binary with @xmath45 = 8.0 @xmath13 m .",
    "this object has a small 24 @xmath13 m excess , consistent with wien side of the emission from a cold outer disk .",
    "objects # 12 and 23 have a low disk masses ( @xmath65 1.7 m@xmath2 ) , negligible accretion , and l@xmath48/l@xmath35 @xmath1 10@xmath7 .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , they are likely to be in the debris disk stage , regardless of the origin of the inner hole .",
    "after target # 23 , the next tighter binary is source # 5 , with a projected separation of 0.54@xmath18 ( or 68 au ) .",
    "since this object has @xmath45 = 5.8 @xmath13 m , suggesting the presence of dust at @xmath241 au distances , it is very unlikely that the presence of its inner hole is related to the observed companion .",
    "since vlt - ao observations are clearly not sensitive to companions with separations @xmath24 8 au , a complementary radial velocity survey to find the tightest companions would be highly desirable to identify additional circumbinary disks within our sample .",
    "once primordial sub - micron dust grains grow into somewhat larger bodies ( r @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 ) , most of the solid mass ceases to interact with the stellar radiation , and the opacity function decreases dramatically .",
    "grain growth is a strong function of radius ; it is more efficient in the inner regions where the surface density is higher and the dynamical timescales are shorter , and hence can also produce opacity holes .",
    "idealized dust coagulation models ( i.e. , ignoring fragmentation and radial drift ) predict extremely efficient grain growth ( dullemond @xmath8 dominik , 2005 ) resulting in the depletion of all small grains in timescales of the order of 10@xmath69 yrs , which is clearly inconsistent with the observational constraints on the lifetime of circusmtellar dust . in reality , however , the persistence of small opacity - bearing grains depends on a complex balance between dust coagulation and fragmentation ( dominik @xmath8 dullemond , 2008 ) .    since grain growth affects only the dust and operates preferentially at smaller radii , a disk evolution dominated by grain growth",
    "is expected to result in an actively accreting disk with reduced opacity in the inner regions .",
    "all the accreting disks in our sample , whose seds are shown in figure  [ sed_acc ] , are thus in principle consistent with grain growth .",
    "objects with very strong accretion ( i.e. , @xmath25 10@xmath70 m@xmath5yr@xmath6 ) are especially good candidates for grain growth dominated disks as an opacity hole is likely to trigger the onset of the magneto - rotational instability and exacerbate accretion ( chiang @xmath8 murray - clay , 2007 ) . target # 14 , which is the extensively studied system doar 25 , is a prime example of this scenario .",
    "it has , by far , the highest disk mass in our sample ( @xmath038 m@xmath2 ) and one of the highest accretion rates ( @xmath010@xmath71 m@xmath5yr@xmath6 ) .",
    "this object has recently been imaged at high spatial resolution with the submillimeter array , and its sed and visibilities have been successfully reproduced with a simple model incorporating significant grain growth in its inner regions ( andrews et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "grain growth is considered the first step toward planet formation .",
    "unfortunately , the observational effects of grains growing into terrestrial planets are no different from those of growing into meter size objects . as a result",
    ", the observations presented herein place no constraints on how far along the planet formation process currently is , unless the planet becomes a giant planet , massive enough to dynamically open a gap in the disk .",
    "since theoretical models of the dynamical interactions of forming giant planets with the disk ( lin @xmath8 papaloizous 1979 , artymowicz @xmath8 lubow 1994 ) predict the formation of inner holes and gaps , planet formation quickly became one of the most exciting explanations proposed for the inner holes of transition disks ( calvet et al . 2002 , 2005 ; quillen et al .",
    "2004 ; dalessio et al . 2005 ; brown et .",
    "a planet massive enough to open a gap in the disk ( m @xmath250.1 - 0.5 m@xmath2 ) , is expected to divert most of the material accreting from the outer disk onto itself . as a result , in the presence of a jupiter mass planet",
    ", the accretion onto the star is expected to be reduced by a factor of 4 to 10 with respect to the accretion across the outer disk ( lubow @xmath8 d@xmath72angelo , 2006 ) .",
    "four of the accreting objects in our sample , targets # 11 , 21 , 31 , and 32 have @xmath46 @xmath11 0 , suggesting the presence of a sharp inner hole , and are thus excellent candidates for ongoing _ giant _ planet formation .",
    "source # 32 is a particularly good candidate to be currently forming a massive giant planet , as it has a high disk mass ( @xmath011 m@xmath2 ) and small accretion rate ( 10@xmath73 m@xmath5yr@xmath6 ) .",
    "sources # 11 , 21 , and 31 ( m@xmath34 @xmath1 1.5 m@xmath74 m@xmath38 @xmath010@xmath75 - 10@xmath76 m@xmath5yr@xmath6 ) , could have formed a massive giant planet in the recent past , as in their case most of the disk mass has already been depleted .",
    "since target # 21 has been observed with the lunar occultation technique , an equal - mass binary system can be ruled out for this system down to @xmath01 au ( simon et al .",
    "also , it has been proposed that companions with masses of the order of 10 m@xmath2 completely isolate the inner disk from the outer disk and halt the accretion onto the star ( lubow et al .",
    "if that is the case , accretion itself could be evidence _ against _ the presence of a close ( sub)stellar companion .",
    "that said , because a few accreting close binary systems are already known , such as dq tau ( carr et al .",
    "2001 ) and cs cha ( espaillat et al .",
    "2007 ) , it is clear that accretion does not rule out completely the presence of tight stellar companions .",
    "in addition to the mass of the companion , the eccentricity of the orbit , the viscosity and scale height of the disk are also important factors in determining whether or not gap - crossing streams can exist and allow the accretion onto the star to continue ( artymowicz @xmath8lubow 1996 ) .",
    "based on the discussion above , we divide our transition disk sample into the following  disk types \" :    _ a _ ) 13 grain growth - dominated disks ( accreting objects with @xmath9 @xmath24 0 ) .",
    "b _ ) 4 giant planet forming disks ( accreting objects with @xmath9 @xmath25 0 ) .",
    "c _ ) 5 photoevaporating disks ( non - accreting objects with disk mass @xmath1 2.5 m@xmath2 , but l@xmath48/l@xmath35",
    "@xmath11 10@xmath7 ) + _ d _ ) 4 debris disks ( non - accreting objects with disk mass @xmath1 2.5 m@xmath2 and l@xmath48/l@xmath35 @xmath1 10@xmath7 ) + _ e _ ) 4 circumbinary disks ( a binary tight enough to accommodate both components within the inferred inner hole ) .",
    "the total number of objects listed add up to 30 instead of 26 because 4 objects fall into two categories .",
    "sources # 12 and 23 are considered both debris disks and circumbinary disks . object # 24 has been classified as both a circumbinary disk and a photoevaporating disk , while object # 27 has been classified as both a circumbinary disk and a grain growth dominated disk .",
    "these last two objects are triple systems and their classification depends on whether the ir excess is associated with the tight components of the systems or with the wide components .    the  disk types \" for our targets are listed in table 3 .",
    "all of our objects should be considered to be _ candidates _ for the categories listed above .",
    "the current classification represents our best guess given the available data . only followup observations and detailed modeling",
    "will firmly establish the true nature of each object .",
    "an important caveat of this classification is the lack of constraints for most of the sample on stellar companions within @xmath24 8 au , a range where @xmath030@xmath10 of all stellar companions are expected to lay ( duquennoy @xmath8 mayor , 1991 ; ratzka et al .",
    "future radial velocity observations are very likely to increase the number of objects in the circumbinary disk category .    while it is tempting to speculate that the  disk types \" _ a _ through _ d _ represent an evolutionary sequence , starting with a  full disk \" ( i.e. , a  full disk \" that undergoes grain growth followed by giant planet formation , followed by photoevaporation leading to a debris or disk - less stage ) it is clear that not all disks follow this sequence .",
    "for instance , many of the grain growth dominated disks have disk masses that are 10 times smaller than some of the giant planet forming disks ( e.g. , targets # 1 , 15 , 16 , and 26 vs. # 32 ) .",
    "these former systems have very little mass left in the disk ( @xmath24 1 m@xmath2 ) and might never form giant planets .",
    "it it also clear that not all disks become transition disks in the same way .",
    "some objects become transition disks ( as defined by their seds ) while the total mass of the disk is very large ( e.g. , targets # 32 and 14 , m@xmath34 @xmath010 - 40 m@xmath2 ) , but other objects retain  full disks \" even when the disk mass is relatively small ( m@xmath34 @xmath02 m@xmath2 ) , such as roxr1 29 ( cieza et al . 2008 ) .",
    "since very little dust is needed to keep a disk optically thick at near and mid - ir wavelengths , it is expected that some objects will only become transition disks when their disk masses and accretion rates are low enough to become susceptible to photoevaporation ( i.e. , they will evolve directly from a  full disk \" to a photoevaporating disk followed by a debris or disk - less stage ) .",
    "we have obtained millimeter wavelength photometry , high - resolution optical spectroscopy , and adaptive optics near - infrared imaging for a sample of 34 _ spitzer_-selected yso candidates located in the ophiuchus molecular cloud .",
    "all our targets have seds consistent with circumstellar disks with inner opacity holes ( i.e. , transition disks ) . after removing one likely classical",
    "be star and seven likely agb stars we were left with a sample of 26 transition disks .",
    "we have used these data to estimate the disk mass , accretion rate , and multiplicity of each transition disk in our sample in order to investigate the mechanisms potentially responsible for their inner opacity holes : dynamical interaction with a stellar companion , photoevaporation , grain growth , and giant planet formation .",
    "we find that transition disks exhibit a wide range of masses , accretion rates , and sed morphologies .",
    "they clearly represent a heterogeneous group of objects , but overall , transition disks tend to have much lower masses and accretion rates than  full disks . \"",
    "eight of our targets are multiples : 6 are binaries and the other 2 are triple systems . in four cases ,",
    "the stellar companions are close enough to suspect they are responsible for the inferred inner holes .",
    "we do not see an increased incidence of binaries with separations in the @xmath08 - 20 au range , the range where we are sensitive to companions that could carve the inferred inner holes , suggesting companions at these separations are not responsible for a large fraction of the transition disk population .",
    "however , given the small size of the current sample this result should not be overinterpreted .",
    "a complementary radial velocity survey to find the tightest companions is highly desirable to firmly establish the fraction of transition disks that could be accounted for by very tight binaries .",
    "we find that 9 of our transition disk targets have low disk mass ( @xmath1 2.5 m@xmath2 ) and negligible accretion ( @xmath1 10@xmath3 m@xmath5yr@xmath6 ) , and are thus consistent with photoevaporating ( or photoevaporated ) disks .",
    "four of the non - accreting objects have fractional disk luminosities @xmath1 10@xmath7 and could already be in the debris disk stage .",
    "the remaining 17 objects are accreting .",
    "four of these accreting objects have seds suggesting the presence of sharp inner holes ( @xmath46 values @xmath25 0 ) , and thus are excellent candidates for harboring giant planets .",
    "the other 13 accreting objects have @xmath46 values @xmath24 0 , which suggest a more or less radially continuous disk .",
    "these systems could be forming terrestrial planets , but their planet formation stage remains unconstrained by current observations .    understanding transition disks is key to understanding disk evolution and planet formation .",
    "they are systems where important disk evolution processes such as grain growth , photevaporation , dynamical interactions and planet formation itself are clearly discernable . in the near future ,",
    "detailed studies of transition disks such as sources # 11 , 21 , 31 , and 32 , will very likely revolutionize our understanding of planet formation .",
    "in particular , the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) will have the resolution and sensitivity needed to image these transition disks , using both the continuum and molecular tracers , at @xmath01 - 3 au resolution .",
    "such exquisite observations will provide unprecedented observational constraints , much needed to distinguish among competing theories of planet formation .",
