    "the standard model has three free parameters in the bosonic sector : the electromagnetic coupling constant , @xmath5 , the mass of the z boson , @xmath6 , and the fermi coupling constant , @xmath2 .",
    "the theory becomes predictive when these and several other fundamental parameters have been determined experimentally . by progressively improving the precision of these parameters ,",
    "the theoretical predictions become increasingly precise and , in turn , the experimental measurements are increasingly sensitive to new physics beyond the standard model . therefore , on quite general grounds , it is important for each of the fundamental parameters of the standard model to be measured with the highest possible experimental precision .",
    "the fermi coupling constant is determined from the measurement of the positive muon lifetime , @xmath7 , through the relationship @xmath8 in order to avoid uncertainties in the capture rate of negative muons on the target nuclei , the more precise value of @xmath2  is derived from the positive muon lifetime . in this equation",
    "@xmath9 encapsulates the higher order qed and qcd corrections calculated in the fermi theory , in which the weak charged current is described by a contact interaction .",
    "this is discussed in detail by van ritbergen and stuart @xcite , who have computed the second - order qed corrections and reduced the theoretical uncertainty of the radiative corrections to 0.3 ppm .",
    "in contrast to the case for @xmath5 , @xmath2   is not afflicted with a hadronic uncertainty until 2-loops is reached , and consequently its influence is negligible .    among the other parameters in eq.[eq_gf ] ,",
    "the error on the muon mass , @xmath10 , contributes an uncertainty of 0.21 ppm to @xmath2 .",
    "the contribution from the uncertainty in the muon neutrino mass is negligible , assuming the mass limits implied by neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "the largest uncertainty in @xmath2  comes from the error on @xmath7 , which is 18 ppm in the 2006 review of particle properties @xcite , and recently reduced by a new measurement from the mulan experiment at psi to a precision of 11 ppm @xcite . in this paper , an initial measurement of @xmath7",
    "is presented from the fast experiment with a precision of 16 ppm .",
    "the final goal of fast is an uncertainty of 2 ppm in @xmath7 , which will determine @xmath2  to 1  ppm precision .",
    "the fast detector ( fig .  [ fig_fast_detector ] ) operates in the @xmath11m1 secondary beamline of the 590 mev proton cyclotron at the paul scherrer institute , which generates a 2 ma dc proton beam ( 100% duty cycle ) .",
    "the detector is a fast imaging target of @xmath12 pixels constructed from plastic scintillator bars of dimension @xmath13  mm@xmath14 .",
    "the target is read out by wavelength shifter fibres attached to hamamatsu h6568 - 10 position sensitive photomultipliers ( pspms ) .",
    "there are 96 pspms in total , each one viewing @xmath15 pixels .",
    "a dc @xmath16 beam of momentum 165 mev / c is stopped in the target and the decay times of each @xmath17  decay chain are registered .",
    "a wedge - shaped beam degrader ensures that the pion stopping positions are distributed uniformly through the target .",
    "a local copper beam collimator defines a beam aperture of @xmath18  mm@xmath19 and suppresses pion stops near the edges of the target .",
    "an array 16 finger counters ( z counters ) , each @xmath20   mm@xmath19 , measures the vertical position of the beam particle as it enters the target .    in order to reach the final goal of a 1 ppm measurement of @xmath2 ,",
    "fast must handle a factor 100 higher event rate than earlier muon lifetime experiments and , at the same time , reduce the systematic errors by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "the high rate is achieved by means of a highly granular and fast detector that can measure several muon decays in parallel .",
    "the imaging target ( fig.[fig_fast_detector ] ) essentially comprises a large number of replicated mini - detectors placed side - by - side , each one capable of making an independent and simultaneous measurement of a @xmath21  decay . with regards systematic uncertainties , the detector is designed to suppress several effects that limited previous experiments .",
    "firstly , pile - up effects are reduced by a fast , imaging detector . secondly ,",
    "possible gain shifts and additional event losses at the start of the muon decay period due to the higher counting rate are avoided by operating in a dc beam ( uniform counting rate ) .",
    "thirdly , muon spin polarisation systematics are highly suppressed by a ) using a @xmath16  beam ( spin 0 ) and tagging the @xmath22  transition , b ) applying range cuts that further suppress residual beam muons , c ) designing a uniform detector with large angular acceptance , and d ) providing an 80  g magnetic field across the target , which causes rapid precession of the muons so that any residual spin effects can be observed and measured .",
    "the pspm signals are passed through pre - amplifiers into custom - designed updating discriminators with dual - threshold differential ecl outputs .",
    "the low level ( ll ) threshold is satisfied by minimum ionizing particles , and the ll pulses are sent to the time - to - digital converters ( tdcs ) .",
    "the high level ( hl ) threshold is set to efficiently detect the large pulses from stopping pions or @xmath22  decays ( 4 mev muon kinetic energy ) , but to suppress minimum ionizing particles .",
    "the hl pulses are sent to the level 2 ( lv2 ) trigger .",
    "the time measurement is performed with 16 caen v767 128-channel multihit tdcs  @xcite .",
    "they provide a fast time stamp for each pspm pulse and then load the pixel address and time into memory .",
    "dual hit registers on each input channel of the tdcs ensure a short minimum time separation of 10 ns for two hits to be registered on the same channel , although a longer deadtime of up to several 100 ns occurs before a third hit can be registered on the same channel since the contents of the hit registers must first be written into the local event buffer .",
    "the tdcs are driven by an external 30 mhz rb atomic clock .",
    "this defines a precise so - called _ coarse _ tdc tick which is then divided by the delay locked loop of the tdc chip into 32 _ fine _ tdc ticks , each of 1.041667 ns .",
    "the time window of the tdcs is set to measure decays between -8  @xmath1s and + 22  @xmath1s relative to the pion stop time .",
    "the level 1 ( lv1 ) trigger defines an incident beam particle by a coincidence of three beam counters ( bc1 , bc2 and z ) with the accelerator rf signal .",
    "the leading edge of the lv1 trigger is determined by the machine rf pulse ( period @xmath2319  ns ) .",
    "the lv1 deadtime is 50 ns , implying that no further triggers are accepted in the two subsequent rf buckets .",
    "the lv2 trigger uses the hl data from the target to a ) reconstruct the pion stopping pixel and b ) identify the subsequent @xmath22  decay . having identified a prompt stopping beam pion , in - time with lv1 , the lv2 trigger is satisfied by a delayed second pulse  within a 15100 ns window  on any of the @xmath24 pixels centred on the pion stop pixel .",
    "the lv2 trigger then provides a selective trigger pulse for the tdcs subtended by a @xmath25 pixel array centred on the pion stop pixel .",
    "this serves to reduce the data bandwidth requirements of the data acquisition system ( daq ) since , on average , only 2.4 out of the 16 tdc modules are triggered per event .",
    "the @xmath26 and @xmath27 coordinates of the muon stop pixel are also sent to tdc data inputs for use in the subsequent event analysis .",
    "the experiment reads out only tdc data ; each 128  ch tdc has 96 ch devoted to target readout and 32  ch devoted to other data , including the pion stop coordinates .",
    "the lv2 trigger operates at up to 1  mhz trigger rate and can process multiple lv1 triggers in parallel , provided they are separated by at least 50  ns .",
    "the very high data rate of the fast detector makes it impractical to store all events for later analysis offline .",
    "not only would the disk space requirements be huge  about 7  tb / day  but the reading and reprocessing time for these events would far exceed the original time taken for their collection .",
    "the adopted solution is to carry out a full analysis of all data online , and to record approximately each hour a set of about 1200 separate muon lifetime histograms that contain all the information required for the lifetime measurement and for the study of systematic errors .",
    "in addition , a pre - scaled fraction of the raw events  of order 1% depending on the rate  are recorded for monitoring purposes and to study specific aspects of the systematic errors .",
    "a web - based online monitor program accumulates control histograms to verify the proper functioning of the detector and provides a warning if any distribution falls outside its pre - defined tolerance .",
    "the monitor program includes a software emulation of the lv2 trigger ( albeit with ll data ) and continuously verifies the correct functioning of the lv2 hardware trigger .",
    "the analysis procedure uses the muon coordinates given by lv2 and identifies any positron candidate emerging from the muon pixel in the -8 to 22  @xmath1s window .",
    "positron tracks are identified using a set of 512 mask topologies in a so - called @xmath28 _ superpixel _ matrix centred on the muon pixel .",
    "the mask topologies are chosen to be highly efficient for accepting true positrons from muon decays , while suppressing false positrons due to overlapping tracks from other beam particles or decays elsewhere in the target .",
    "the absolute positron time is taken as the average of all the positron pixels within the superpixel .",
    "the readout of the tdc s is done via pvic boards @xcite which provide an interface between the daq pcs and the 4 vme crates containing the tdc modules .",
    "the data are transferred at the full vme bandwidth limit of 20  mb / s per crate into 4 daq pcs . a gigabit ethernet switch and collector pc",
    "then build the events from the daq pcs into time slices and pass these slices in turn to a farm of event analyser pcs .",
    "the event analyser pcs process the events and write the histograms and other information to disk .",
    "the data were recorded in december 2006 at an average lv2 trigger rate of 30 khz .",
    "the muon lifetime histogram for the full data sample of @xmath29 events is shown in fig.[fig_lifetime]a , measured with the resolution of a fine tdc tick ( 1.041667  ns ) . the positron time is measured relative to the time of the beam particle as defined by the lv1 pulse ( which is synchronised with the accelerator rf time ) .",
    "the analysis allows one and only one positron candidate to be found in the -8 to 22  @xmath1s window ; events failing this criterion are rejected .",
    "events are also rejected if the pion stop position falls outside an @xmath26 range of pixels defined by the associated z counter ( this suppresses a small contamination of beam muons since their range is 21 pixels further than pions ) .",
    "after some additional geometrical and quality criteria are applied , 42% of the lv2-triggered events are accepted for inclusion in the lifetime histograms ( figs.[fig_lifetime ] ) .",
    "the appearance of muon decays at negative times involves the loss of the true positron and the gain of a fake positron .",
    "as seen in the insert of fig.[fig_lifetime]a , the fake positron background is structured with the accelerator rf period and dominated by incoming beam particles .",
    "the events with negative decay times allow a precise description to be obtained for the accidental background .",
    "the events with positive lifetime are used to perform the muon lifetime measurement .",
    "figure [ fig_lifetime]b shows the same data after rebinning by exactly the accelerator rf period ( `` rf rebinning '' ) , as described below , which eliminates the beam structure .",
    "a slight exponential behaviour can be seen in the background near the boundaries of the measurement window , as anticipated in the original study of systematic errors for the fast proposal @xcite .",
    "the increase in background around -8  @xmath1s is due to positrons from another pion that stops in the signal muon pixel _ before _ the early edge of the window , whereas the increase in background around + 22  @xmath1s is due to another pion that stops in the signal muon pixel ( thereby faking a positron ) but whose subsequent positron emerges _",
    "after _ the late edge of the window . in both cases",
    "the background grows as the edge of the window is approached .",
    "the measurement of the muon lifetime is performed in three steps .",
    "first , the beam period is obtained with high precision from the negative decay region in fig.[fig_lifetime]a .",
    "then , the lifetime histogram is rebinned using the measured beam period as the bin width ( fig.[fig_lifetime]b ) .",
    "finally a fit to the rebinned histogram is performed with the muon lifetime as one of the free parameters .",
    "the rebinning minimises the influence of the periodic background structure on the measurement of the lifetime",
    ". a systematic error due to this fit method is assessed by comparing the lifetime value obtained from the data without rebinning (  [ sec_fine_bin_fit ] ) .",
    "two different methods were used to obtain the beam period . in both cases , the decay interval from -7000 to -1000 tdc ticks was used , since this maximised the statistics while minimising the possible systematic uncertainties related to the exponential tail .",
    "the first method consists of folding the full interval into a single period .",
    "the dispersion of the points around the mean shape of the background is a minimum for the real beam period (  [ sec_fine_bin_fit ] ) .",
    "the second method uses the fourier transform of the data to determine the frequency with the highest power , which corresponds to the beam frequency .",
    "both methods agree and determine the beam period to be 18.960051 tdc ticks , with a precision of better than 1 ppm . since this does not correspond to an integer number of tdc ticks , the data are `` rf rebinned '' by dividing fractional tdc ticks into the two adjacent bins according to a linear sharing algorithm .",
    "a further periodicity is introduced in the data by a non - linearity of the tdcs .",
    "although the coarse ticks are perfectly paced by the 30  mhz rb atomic clock , the 32 fine ticks are determined by the tdc chip interpolation .",
    "this was found to have a non - linearity with an amplitude of 1 per mil , introducing periodicities of 16 and 32 ticks in the fit residuals .",
    "an identical tdc non - linearity was measured in both the beam data ( by folding the residuals with a period of 1 rb coarse clock tick ) and in laboratory measurements ( using random flat data ) .",
    "the positive region of the lifetime distribution in fig.[fig_lifetime]b is fitted with the function @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the electron time relative to the rf bucket of the beam pion , @xmath32 accounts for the tdc non - linearity , and the parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 describe the amplitude of each component .",
    "the first term represents the muon decay signal , the second term accounts for the small exponential rise of the background at the positive edge of the window , and the final term accounts for the flat , uncorrelated background .",
    "the free parameters of the fit are @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath7 .",
    "a binned maximum likelihood fit to the data is performed over the interval from 600 to 20000 tdc ticks .",
    "the lower limit is chosen to avoid the `` third hit '' tdc inefficiency at earlier times , and the upper limit avoids undue sensitivity to the rising background near the edge of the time window .",
    "the result for the lifetime is @xmath36 tdc ticks [ 2.197 083 ( 32 ) @xmath1s ] , with @xmath37 for 1020 degrees of freedom , corresponding to 40.1% probability .",
    "the residuals of the fit show no systematic trends versus decay time ( fig.[fig_residuals]a ) and are gaussian distributed , with the expected mean and width ( fig.[fig_residuals]b ) .",
    "the fitted signal fraction is 96.82% , while the positive exponential contribution is 0.02% and the flat background accounts for 3.15% .",
    "several further tests of the quality of the fit have been performed .",
    "the fourier transform of the residuals reveals no periodicities .",
    "furthermore , the fit has been separated into four regions to check the stability and quality in samples that are statistically independent .",
    "the four regions are 6003000 , 30006000 , 600010000 , and 1000020000 tdc ticks . within statistical errors ,",
    "the fitted lifetime is the same in all four regions , as is the fitted constant background term .",
    "as expected , the late decay region above 10000 ticks is most sensitive to the correct description of the background , while the early decays are essentially insensitive to background uncertainties .",
    "overall , no evidence has been found to suggest any problems with the quality of the fit .",
    "an alternative analysis has been carried out using the original lifetime histogram with a fine bin size of 1 tdc tick ( fig.[fig_lifetime]a ) .",
    "the data are fitted in two steps .",
    "first , a description of the shape of the background is obtained from the negative region .",
    "second , this description plus the decay exponential and some other small corrections are used to fit the data in the positive lifetime region .",
    "the systematic uncertainties of this analysis are somewhat larger than for the nominal fit with the rf rebinned data since a more precise description is required for the dc background structure and for the pulsed , positive exponential background at the end of the tdc window . nevertheless , this second analysis is important in order to check the consistency of the nominal fit and to assign a systematic error to the fit method .",
    "a precise description of the negative region is obtained by folding all the data from -7000 tdc ticks to -1000 tdc ticks into one single rf period .",
    "the folded data ( fig.[fig_spline]a ) clearly show the three components of the beam background : muons ( -15 tdc ticks ) , electrons ( -9 ticks ) and pions ( bump near -6 ticks ) .",
    "the different timings between the particles are due to their different times - of - flight from the production target .",
    "the structure is well - described using a spline with 150 knots .",
    "the negative decay region is then fitted by the sum of an exponential , a flat background and the spline , repeated with the measured rf frequency .",
    "the fit  a region of which is shown in fig.[fig_spline]b  has a @xmath38 for 5995 degrees of freedom .",
    "once the shape of the background is fixed using the negative region , the positive lifetime region is fitted using the function : @xmath39    where @xmath31 is the electron time relative to the beam pion , the parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 describe the amplitude of each component , @xmath40 is the correction due to the tdc non - linearity and @xmath41 describes the shape of the increasing beam pion background near the positive edge of the window .",
    "the free parameters of the fit are @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath7 .",
    "a binned maximum likelihood fit is performed to the data between 600 and 16000 tdc ticks .",
    "the fit region excludes longer - lived muons since they are most sensitive to uncertainties in the background description .",
    "the muon lifetime obtained with these fine binned data is 5.2 ppm below the nominal value obtained with the rf rebinned data .",
    "possible sources of systematic error have been identified and their influence on the lifetime has been evaluated in turn with the experimental data , as discussed below .    [ [ fit - method ] ] 1 .",
    "fit method : + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the stability of the measured lifetime is checked by varying the starting point and the end point of the fit over a large region .",

    "the influence of the algorithm for rf rebinning has been checked using three different methods : simple sharing , linear interpolation and quadratic interpolation .",
    "the observed difference between the measured lifetimes is below 0.1 ppm .",
    "the systematic error on the tdc non - linearity correction has been estimated using two different corrections , with different amplitudes and phases .",
    "no effect is observed on the fitted lifetime .",
    "the sensitivity to the phase of the periodic beam background has been estimated by varying this parameter over one full beam period .",
    "the associated systematic error is @xmath42 ppm .",
    "furthermore the central value of the period has been varied by @xmath43  ppm , which is far outside the range of experimental uncertainty .",
    "the influence in the measured lifetime is @xmath44 ppm .",
    "four different methods have been used to perform the fit to test if there is any sensitivity to the analytical method : minimise the @xmath45 , maximum the likelihood , minimise the kullback - leibler discrepancy and minimise the absolute value of the residuals .",
    "the various methods are sensitive to different features of the distribution .",
    "since no differences are found , we conclude that the fitted lifetime is insensitive to the analytical method .    finally ,",
    "in order to evaluate possible biases of the rebinned method , the results have been compared with an independent measurement using the fine binned data .",
    "the method used to obtain the lifetime from the fine binned histogram is described above .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig_systematics]a for bin sizes between 1 and 34 tdc ticks . to account for the difference in the lifetime measurement between the rf rebinned method and the fine - binned ( 1 tdc tick ) method ,",

    "the resultant lifetime distributions are sensitive to different systematic errors .",
    "a pion start time makes the distribution independent of the muon time and also sharpens the beam structure of the background events ; a muon start time makes the analysis less sensitive to the shape of the beam background .",
    "the difference of the fitted lifetime values for the two methods ( @xmath1 start minus nominal @xmath11 start ) is @xmath49 ppm and is taken as the associated systematic uncertainty .",

    "any sub - samples having lifetime measurements that are statistically incompatible ( @xmath503@xmath51 ) with the nominal lifetime measurement are then removed and a new lifetime determined from the remaining total sample .",

    "no systematic effects are observed except as a function of pspm ( fig.[fig_systematics]b ) .",
