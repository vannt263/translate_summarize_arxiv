    "<S> in fact , at relatively high temperatures the populations of the valence and conduction bands , which are typically quite small due to the large activation energy of n- and p - type dopants in diamond , should significantly increase@xcite and thus potentially lead to much higher electroluminescent rates .    </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the luminescence peaked at 738 nm of the negatively - charged silicon - vacancy ( siv@xmath0 ) center in diamond has long been studied in the range between cryogenic and room temperatures.@xcite those measurements revealed , along with a red shift and a widening of the zero - phonon line ( zpl ) with increasing temperatures , a quenching of the luminescence presumably due to the thermal activation of a non - radiative decay mode with an activation energy evaluated in ref .   of about 70 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the integrated signal seemed to reach a plateau beyond 250 k , placed at about 10%@xcite or 20%@xcite of the low temperature limit .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we report on the luminescence properties of siv^-^ color centers in diamond at temperatures from 293 k to 861 k. in this range , we observed a further reduction of the integrated luminescence ascribable to population transfer into a shelving state,@xcite facilitated by a transition channel with an activation energy of 180 mev . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , the decrease of the signal is only 50% of the room - temperature level at about 500 k and at about 700 k it reaches a value corresponding to 25% of that at 293 k. the intensity is still decreasing at further higher temperatures , although at a reduced rate . </S>",
    "<S> the quenching takes place along with a red - shift of the 738 nm peak up to 751 nm at 861 k , and with an increase of the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) from less than 6 nm at 293 k to more than 80 nm at 861 k , while the phonon side - band becomes progressively less important down to complete quenching at about 600 k.    we implanted 8 mev si - ions in an optical grade single crystal diamond of @xmath1 mm^3^ ( elementsix ( r ) ) . </S>",

    "<S> the irradiation fluence was evaluated to be @xmath4 cm^-2^. the implantation depth distribution , calculated with the monte carlo srim code,@xcite is peaked at 2.1 @xmath5 m , with a fwhm of 100 nm , thus the average volumetric density around the bragg peak is around @xmath6 cm^-3^. after irradiation , the sample presents a strong darkening due to the high density of defects induced by irradiation ( a photographic image of the implanted sample taken before annealing is shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> after annealing an almost complete recovery of the transparency of the sample was obtained , due to high temperature mobility of the defects , which favors both the recombination of the frenkel couples and the formation of the siv@xmath0 color centers.@xcite a fluorescence map acquired at 293 k is shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig3 ] shows the observed behavior of the integrated luminescence as a function of the excitation power at 293 k. the sublinear behavior of the luminescence with increasing power can be accounted for assuming @xmath30 at room temperature . from the fit of the data it results that @xmath31 mw . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq1 ] ) with @xmath12 and @xmath17 free parameters , which result to be @xmath32 mev and @xmath33 ( at the power @xmath34 mw ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a high value of @xmath17 can serve as a discriminator between different alternative models of the quenching mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> for instance , if one assumes the simplest possible mechanism based on three levels ( see appendix  [ 3level ] ) : the ground ( 1 ) and the excited level ( 2 ) at 1.68 ev , plus a third level ( 3 ) decaying to the ground state and placed 0.18 ev above the excited level , the results are not compatible with the experimental numerical values . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the form of the constant @xmath20 becomes @xmath35 , were @xmath36 is the rate constant between the @xmath37 and the @xmath38 state . here </S>",

    "<S> on the other hand , a shelving state ( 3 ) placed _ below _ the level 2 is assumed to explain the bounching behavior for large correlation times of siv@xmath0 centers as single photon emitters,@xcite and a higher energy state radiatively bounded to the shelving state is invoked to give account of the de - shelving observed at high excitation powers .    </S>",
    "<S> it is then more conceivable a scheme with a shelving state ( 3 ) and a fourth level ( 4 ) , radiatively connected with the shelving state , placed at 0.18 ev above the state ( 2 ) , as shown in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , being the transitions @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 optically forbidden . </S>",
    "<S> the inversion symmetry of the d@xmath46 point group implies indeed that the state functions of the siv@xmath0 have definite parity , giving a whole set of forbidden transitions of this kind.@xcite in this case , the constant @xmath20 assumes a quite complicated form , which simplifies , in the case that the rates @xmath47 and @xmath48 are much smaller than @xmath49 ( as in ref .  ) in the following one : @xmath50 .    assuming that @xmath51 and referring to the average values of @xmath49 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 reported in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> ( see table in the appendix  [ rateconst ] ) , we obtain @xmath52 . since the ratio @xmath53 is small compared with unity and given the fitted value of @xmath54 mw , the factor @xmath39 is approximately 0.32 and the product @xmath55 results @xmath56 , which has the correct order of magnitude .    </S>",
    "<S> the possible emission corresponding to the transition @xmath57 is governed by an equation of the kind @xmath58 which gives a negligible signal at room temperature and also at 800 k does not exceed 1% of the @xmath59 at room temperature .    in conclusion , we discovered that the integrated luminescence of the siv@xmath0 color center is still strong at temperatures as high as 500 k , with a fwhm which remains lower than 20 nm . </S>",
    "<S> we attributed such a relatively weak decrease of the fluorescence signal with increasing temperature to population transfer to a shelving state , enhanced by a transition channel with an activation energy of 180 mev . </S>",
    "<S> our findings provide distinct information on the optical properties of the siv@xmath0 , which may be relevant for developing light - emitting devices that operate at high temperatures , and encourage further investigations of color centers in diamond under such experimental conditions .    </S>",
