    "in conclusion , we present exact diagonalization studies of spin phase transitions of two electrons confined in nanowire quantum dots with highly tunable aspect ratio and external magnetic field . a configuration interaction theory based on a 3d parabolic model for such three dimensionally confining qds",
    "is developed , which provides generalized explicit formulation of the coulomb matrix elements and allows for straightforward implementation of direct diagonalization .",
    "the exact diagonalization study reveals fruitful features of spin st transitions with respect to the tunable geometric aspect ratio and applied magnetic field .    for disk - like qds",
    ", the st transition behaviors may be dominated by the spin zeeman , the direct - coulomb , and the exchange energies .",
    "the pronounced coulomb correlations are identified in rod - like qds with aspect ratio @xmath175 , which energetically favor singlet spin states and yield the always non - zero critical magnetic fields of st transitions .",
    "the developed theory is further employed to study spin phase diagram in the dimensional `` cross over '' regime from the 2d ( disk - like ) qds to finite 1d ( rod - like ) qds . in the 2d disk - like qd regime ,",
    "various distinctive spin phases are emerged under the conditions of appropriate lateral confinement strength and magnetic fields . in the rod - like qd regime , switching the st transitions is shown feasible by controlling both lateral and/or longitudinal confinement strength .",
