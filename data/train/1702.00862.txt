    "quantum hall measurements  @xcite in graphene  @xcite revealed the relativistic nature of its charge carriers and the gapless spectrum .",
    "long before the discovery of graphene , it was known that carriers in a conventional two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) tend to move along snake like paths when exposed to inhomogeneous magnetic fields , the so called _ snake states._@xcite similar effects were explored even earlier in the studies of electron propagation on the boundary of magnetic domains in metallic systems .",
    "@xcite experiments in non - planar 2deg@xcite and in systems with ferromagnetic stripe@xcite indirectly measured the effects of snake states on the longitudinal and the hall resistances . in graphene ,",
    "theoretical predictions of snake - state effects  @xcite were quickly followed by experiments which confirmed their existence .",
    "@xcite snake states in a hall bar geometry were previously studied in ref .   using a classical billiard model .",
    "a top - gate was used to create a @xmath0 junction along the main diagonal of the hall cross , and oscillations of the bend resistance were connected with electron guiding along the snake - like paths at the @xmath0 interface .    in this paper",
    "we study quantum transport of electrons in graphene hall bars surrounded with four side - gates ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_system ] ) .",
    "the gates modify the local electron density on the edges of the hall bar , and induce a local electric potential .",
    "if the system is placed in an external magnetic field , this edge potential guides the charge carriers along specific equipotential lines . for weak fields , these states move along the previously mentioned snake - like paths , while for stronger fields , we prefer to call them guided states .",
    "our main goal is to understand how this guiding occurs locally , and which paths the electron takes inside the system .",
    "our second goal is to predict the experimentally measurable effects of this guiding .",
    "we start by investigating how the side - gate potential modifies the dispersion relations of the electrons in each lead . by studying the current density profiles of the incoming and outgoing states in two representative leads , we are able to build a physical picture of electron transport in this inhomogeneous system .",
    "this picture , in combination with the landauer - bttiker formalism , allows us to analytically predict the quantization of the bend and hall resistances .",
    "the quantized resistance values match the ones that we obtain with our numerical , tight - binding method .",
    "although we choose one specific potential configuration , with asymmetrically biased side - gates , our results are equally extendable to other gate configurations , and possibly even to other geometries .",
    "( color online ) side - gated hall bar system .",
    "four leads are marked with numbers , and they all have approximately equal width ( @xmath1 nm , and @xmath2 nm , @xmath3 nm ) .",
    "horizontal leads have zigzag edges , while vertical leads have armchair edges , and all dangling bonds are removed .",
    "three lines @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 show the minimal distances from the system edge to three arbitrary points @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "these distances are used in eq .",
    "( [ eq_pot ] ) to calculate the gate potential of the @xmath10 lead at the corresponding points @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "the potential profiles inside the leads are depicted by the blue curves above the @xmath11 and below the @xmath12 lead ( black dashed lines mark the position of the zero potential ) . ]",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : system ] we describe our system and our numerical methods .",
    "section  [ sec_results ] is divided in four parts . in the first part ( [ subdispersion ] )",
    "we analyze the dispersion relations of the leads , and in the second ( [ submodes ] ) we show how guided states look in real space .",
    "a scheme for electron guiding is presented in the third part ( [ subguiding ] ) , and we use this scheme to analytically calculate the bend and the hall resistances in the last subsection ( [ sublb ] ) .",
    "our conclusions are given in sec .",

    "the studied system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_system ] , it is a graphene cross with four side gates ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) placed between four orthogonal leads . when biased , the gates create a local potential at the system edges , which decreases towards the interior of the system .",
    "we model the potential of a single side gate by a gaussian function @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the minimal distance from the present point to the system edge ( see fig .  [ fig_system ] ) .",
    "the width of the potential @xmath19 is set to 10 nm , so that potentials of neighbouring gates do not overlap .",
    "we use @xmath13 as a reference gate , and potentials of all other gates ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ) are set opposite to that of the @xmath13 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_system ] .    for our numerical calculations we use kwant , a software package for quantum transport simulations based on the tight - binding model.@xcite graphene",
    "is modeled in kwant using the tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the electron creation and annihilation operators , and @xmath23 is the value of the total gate potential ( @xmath24 ) on the @xmath25-th carbon atom . the hopping term @xmath26",
    "is defined using the electron hopping energy , and the peierls phase factor @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the vector potential .",
    "the vector potential in the horizontal leads is set using the landau gauge , and that in the vertical leads is .",
    "these two potentials are smoothly connected in the main scattering region using the procedure described in refs .  .",
    "first we study the dispersion relations ( presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_dispersions ] ) of the side - gated graphene leads .",
    "we compare three cases with different combinations of the side - gate potential and magnetic field .",
    "dispersion relations without magnetic field or external potential were extensively studied in refs .  , and therefore we do not present them here .",
    "dispersions for a nonzero potential and without magnetic field are shown in the first row in fig .",
    "[ fig_dispersions ] . in our previous work",
    "@xcite on quantum point contacts we investigated the dispersion relations of symmetrically gated leads , where the same gaussian potential as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq_pot ] ) was used . here , for zigzag leads , we focus on a narrow wave - vector range in close proximity of the two valleys ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "the potential on the edges determines the energy of the dispersionless bands . in case of a symmetric potential , as in the @xmath31 lead , dispersionless bands shift in energy to a value of @xmath32 . on the other hand , in asymmetrically gated @xmath10 lead , side - gates open a small energy gap between the two flat bands .",
    "the gap energy is determined by the lead width . in armchair leads ,",
    "the asymmetric potential in the @xmath11 lead preserves the electron - hole symmetry , while the symmetric potential in the @xmath12 lead moves the dirac point towards negative energies .    results for a nonzero magnetic field and no gate potential ( second row in fig .",
    "[ fig_dispersions ] ) are explained in ref .  .",
    "in this case , both armchair and zigzag leads show dispersionless surface states , appearing exactly at the energy of the landau levels ( lls ) . in this regime ,",
    "graphene exhibits specific quantization of the hall resistance , as it was measured in refs .  .",
    "the most relevant case for us is when both magnetic field and side - gate potential are present in the system ( third row in fig .",
    "[ fig_dispersions ] ) .",
    "first noticeable difference introduced by the side - gates is a twisting of the otherwise flat bands of the surface states ( compare the second and the third row in fig .",
    "[ fig_dispersions ] ) . as a consequence of this twisting",
    ", surface states become dispersed , and new states appear in the bulk . as we show below these states appear only in specific areas of the sample . in general the symmetry of the lead potential",
    "is reflected in the lead dispersion .",
    "we plot the potential profiles of each lead in the third row of fig .",
    "[ fig_dispersions ] ( gray areas ) to show this connection .",
    "asymmetrically gated leads ( the @xmath10 and the @xmath11 lead ) have asymmetric dispersions , while symmetrically gated leads ( the @xmath31 and the @xmath12 lead ) have symmetric dispersions",
    ". for symmetrically gated leads this connection can be explained in the following way : suppose we are interested in how the dispersion relation changes when , instead along the lead , we look in the opposite direction ( towards the system ) . to do this we have to invert the potential profile relative to the middle line of the lead . in the inverse space ( the space of wave vectors @xmath33 )",
    ", this view change is equivalent to inverting the dispersion relative to the axis ( all @xmath33 values go to @xmath34 , and the opposite ) .",
    "if the lead potential is symmetric , then this change of view has no effect . we would obtain the same potential and the same dispersion relation .",
    "in other words , the inverted dispersion is equal to the initial one .",
    "this is the case with the @xmath31 and the @xmath12 lead .    for asymmetrically gated leads ,",
    "this connection between the lead potential and the dispersion is not so straightforward .",
    "if magnetic field is sufficiently strong , the states moving along the opposite edges are completely separated .",
    "these opposite edge states then feel different potentials .",
    "for example , in the @xmath11 lead for zero potential , electron states with positive velocity ( and positive @xmath33 ) move along the left edge , while electrons with negative velocities ( and negative @xmath33 ) , move along the right edge . for holes , states with positive @xmath33 ( and negative velocities )",
    "move along the left edge , while states with negative @xmath33 ( and positive velocities ) move along the right edge . from this",
    "we see that states with positive @xmath33 always move along the left edge , while states with negative @xmath33 always move along the right edge .",
    "therefore , if we apply a potential on the left edge , it will only affect the states with positive @xmath33 , while if we only apply a potential on the right edge , it will only influence the states with negative @xmath33 .",
    "assuming that an electron state with positive @xmath33 is shifted in energy ( due to the side gate potential ) by some value @xmath35 , then electrons with negative @xmath33 are shifted by -@xmath35 , as well as hole states with the same negative @xmath33 . from here , we see that the dispersion is asymmetric @xmath36 . this explanation is similar with the one given in chapter iv in ref .  .",
    "before we proceed to the next part , we would like to stress one very important difference between armchair and zigzag leads .",
    "although the minimal band energies appear to be similar for all leads , they are not precisely equal .",
    "the minimal band energy in armchair leads is slightly smaller than in the zigzag leads .",
    "the red and orange lines in the last row in fig .  [ fig_dispersions ] show this small misalignment .",
    "this difference introduces additional complexity in the system , since a new mode can open in one lead , but electrons can not travel to the neighbouring lead , since there are no open states there . further below",
    ", we explain the importance of this misalignment in more detail .",

    "we focus on studying the evolution of the current profiles in each lead with increaseing fermi energy .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_guiding1](b ) , we present the current density profiles ( insets from 1 to @xmath42 on the right side of fig .",
    "[ fig_guiding1 ] ) for the incoming modes ( red circles in fig .",
    "[ fig_guiding1](a ) ) . as we previously mentioned , because of the potential symmetry , the dispersion relation is also symmetric .",
    "therefore the current density profiles for the outgoing modes can be obtained by inverting the profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_guiding1 ] along the middle line of the lead ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "we can differentiate two groups of outgoing states in figs  [ fig_guiding1](a ) and  [ fig_guiding1](b ) : ( 1 ) the normal edge states ( e.g.  states 1 , 4 , and 9 ) , and ( 2 ) the guided states ( e.g.  states @xmath46 , and @xmath42 ) which move along the specific equipotential lines . the electron kinetic energy along",
    "these equipotential lines match the energy of landau levels . for symmetric potential ,",
    "two of these equipotential lines appear on the system edges for each new appearing ll , and with increasing fermi energy these lines move towards the middle of the lead .",
    "if the applied potential is smaller than the energy difference between two neighbouring lls , then a pair of these equipotential lines appear simultaneously for each ll .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig_guiding1 ] , the energy difference between the @xmath10 ll and the @xmath11 ll is smaller than the applied side - gate potential . therefore , the equipotential lines for the @xmath10 and the @xmath11 ll coexist at higher fermi energies ( green and white lines in insets 8@xmath42 in fig .",
    "[ fig_guiding1](b ) ) .",
    "because of the symmetry of the side - gate potential , these equipotential lines always appear in pairs : the line on the right side correspond to guided electrons coming out of the lead , while the line on the left corresponds to guided electrons coming into the lead .",
    "each of these lines can accommodate two states coming from different valleys ( in armchair leads this is not so obvious , because there are no separate valleys , but in zigzag leads each guided state can be connected with a specific valley ) . for the zeroth ll ,",
    "the guided states are always centered on the equipotential line ( states going along the blue lines in insets 2 , and 3 in fig .",
    "[ fig_guiding1](b ) ) , while for higher lls there is significant broadening of the guided states ( states going along the green lines in insets @xmath46 , and @xmath42 in fig .",

    "in contrast to symmetrically gated leads , here for each ll there is only one equipotential line satisfying the condition . for each new ll",
    "this line appears first on the right edge , and moves towards the left edge as we increase the fermi energy ( see the blue lines in insets 16 in fig .  [ fig_guiding2](b ) ) . for the zeroth ll",

    "<S> quantum electron transport in side - gated graphene hall bars is investigated in the presence of quantizing external magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetric potential of four side - gates distorts the otherwise flat bands of the relativistic landau levels , and creates new propagating states in the landau spectrum ( i.e.  snake states ) . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of these new states leads to an interesting modification of the bend and hall resistances , with new quantizing plateaus appearing in close proximity of the landau levels . </S>",
    "<S> the electron guiding in this system can be understood by studying the current density profiles of the incoming and outgoing modes . from the fact that guided electrons </S>",
    "<S> fully transmit without any backscattering ( similarly to edge states ) , we are able to analytically predict the values of quantized resistances , and they match the resistance data we obtain with our numerical ( tight - binding ) method . </S>",
    "<S> these insights in the electron guiding will be useful in predicting the resistances for other side - gate configurations , and possibly in other system geometries , as long as there is no backscattering of the guided states . </S>"
