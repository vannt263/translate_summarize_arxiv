    "thus , the crs effectively move along with the waves with a bulk ( streaming ) velocity @xmath1 , which is much smaller than @xmath0 .",
    "since the cr pressure is high around the central agn and waves are excited in the direction of the cr pressure gradient ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the model we adopt in this study is basically the same as that in papers  i  iii . assuming that the cluster is spherically symmetric , the flow equations are @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 - n_e^2\\lambda(t ) + h_{\\rm st } + h_{\\rm coll}\\:,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath11   - \\gamma_{\\rm loss } + \\dot{s}_c \\:,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the gas density , @xmath13 is the gas velocity , @xmath14 is the gas pressure , @xmath15 is the cr pressure , @xmath16 is the magnetic pressure , @xmath17 is the gravitational acceleration , @xmath18 is the coefficient for thermal conduction , @xmath19 is the temperature , @xmath20 is the electron density , @xmath3 is the cooling function , @xmath21 is the heating by cr streaming , @xmath22 is the heating by coulomb and hadronic collisions , @xmath23 is the cr transport velocity , @xmath24 is the diffusion coefficient for crs averaged over the cr spectrum , @xmath25 is the energy loss by coulomb and hadronic collisions , and @xmath26 is the source term of crs .",
    "energy densities of the gas and the crs are respectively defined as @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the adiabatic indices for the icm and crs , respectively . for the latter ,",
    "we assume @xmath31 , because we found that the energy spectrum of the crs must be steep and most of the crs have low energies by comparing model predictions with radio observations ( papers  ii and  iii ) .",
    "since we later perform a perturbation analysis , we need to make the model simpler .",
    "we do not include thermal conduction and cr diffusion ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) .",
    "for the same reason , we assume a simple cooling function : @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "we also ignore the gradient of magnetic pressure ( @xmath35 ) in equation  ( [ eq : mom ] ) , because it is not dynamically important .      in our model , crs",
    "are accelerated by the central agn .",
    "the source term of the crs is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the energy injection rate from the agn .",
    "we assume that @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the parameter , and @xmath40 is the flow rate of the gas . in this model , accelerated crs are first carried by buoyant bubbles from the agn out to large distances @xcite .",
    "as the bubbles filled with the crs adiabatically rise , the crs may escape from the bubbles into the icm or they may be injected into the icm through the shredding of the bubbles by rayleigh - taylor and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities .",
    "thus , the crs are gradually injected into the icm as the buoyant bubbles rise . unless otherwise mentioned , we fixed the parameters at the values similar to the ones used in papers  i  iii ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43  kpc , and @xmath44  kpc ) , because they give results that are consistent with observations ( see later ) . in papers",
    "i and ii , we assumed that the crs are accelerated at the forward shock of a cocoon created through the agn activities .",
    "however , it may be more appropriate to assume that cr protons are accelerated around the central black hole and that agn jets or winds consist of the cr protons , especially when @xmath39 is large (   3.1 of paper  iii ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the cr transport velocity is given by @xmath45 in equation  ( [ eq : ec ] ) .",
    "the most simple idea is that @xmath1 is the alfvn velocity @xmath46 , because the crs are scattered by the alfvn waves and move with them .",
    "however , there have been debates about this issue .",
    "it has been indicated that @xmath1 may be much larger than @xmath46 , because in hot icm , alfvn waves may damp at small wave lengths via interactions with thermal protons . in this case , the sound velocity of the gas @xmath47 may be more plausible as the streaming velocity @xcite .",
    "however , there also have been indications that the deficit of the scattering at short wave lengths is overcome by other effects such as mirror scattering or wave cascading ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "if this is the case , the assumption of @xmath48 is appropriate .",
    "we consider the latter case ( @xmath49 ) in the following sections .",
    "we discuss the former case ( @xmath50 ) in appendix .    in this study , we investigate steady state solutions .",
    "therefore , we assume that the growth of the waves is balanced with non - linear wave damping . in other words ,",
    "the cr energy consumed to grow the waves is equal to the wave energy that is put into the icm through the wave damping .",
    "thus , the heating term of the cr streaming is given by @xmath51 note that @xmath52 and @xmath53 in our calculations .    in papers",
    "i and  ii , we studied the evolution of wave amplification . in those studies , we conservatively assumed that the balance between the wave growth and the damping is archived when the wave energy density reaches to that of the background magnetic fields , because some of non - linear damping mechanisms should be effective after that .",
    "as shown in paper  i ( its fig .",
    "3 ) , the time scale in which the growth and the damping is balanced is @xmath54  gyr . since it is less than the time scale of a cluster lifetime ( @xmath55  gyr )",
    ", the assumption of the balance in this study is justified . moreover , if the damping is very efficient , the saturation may be achieved even faster .",
    "for example , if the time scale of the damping is proportional to the inverse of the gyro frequency of cr particles ( e.g. non - linear landau damping ; @xcite ) , the saturated wave energy density is much smaller than that of the background magnetic fields .",
    "we ignore coulomb and hadronic collisions ( @xmath22=0 and @xmath56 ) in equations  ( [ eq : eg ] ) and  ( [ eq : ec ] ) , because they do not much affect the results as follows ( see also papers  i and  iii ) .",
    "the collisional heating term is given by @xmath57 , and the loss term is given by @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the coulomb loss rate and @xmath60 is the hadronic loss rate ( paper  iii ) . in paper  iii , we estimated that @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "in these estimations , we assumed that the cr momentum spectrum is given by a power low ( @xmath65 ) , and the index is @xmath66 .",
    "we chose @xmath66 because it is consistent with observations of radio mini - halos in clusters ( paper  iii ) .",
    "moreover , we assumed that the minimum momentum is @xmath67  mev , at which the effect of coulomb collision is maximum ( paper  iii ) .",
    "for these values , we have confirmed that @xmath68 and @xmath25 can be ignored for the results in the following sections .",
    "we note that the index could be as large as @xmath69 to be consistent with the observations when @xmath48 ( paper  iii ) .",

    "our model predicts that the diffuse emissions originate from the cr protons heating the cluster cores ( paper  iii ) .",
    "in particular , the observed radio profiles can be nicely reproduced by our model .",
    "recently , it has also been proposed that the cr electrons responsible for the radio emission have been accelerated by turbulence generated by the sloshing of the cool core gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "contrary to these models , our model does not require the sloshing because the cr protons are accelerated by the central agns .    while there is no direct relationship between the mini - halos and the sloshing in our model , an apparent relationship could be observed . in our model , mini - halos",
    "are associated with the agns that are active in cool cores .",
    "meanwhile , structures related to the sloshing ( e.g. cold fronts ) are often produced around the cool cores @xcite .",
    "moreover , in our model , the cr electrons responsible for the radio emission are created through the interaction between the cr protons and the target gas protons .",
    "thus , more electrons are created in denser gas , and brighter radio emission would be observed in denser cores or on the denser side of a cold front associated with the sloshing . of course , our model predicts that even clusters without sloshing can have the mini - halos . in the sloshing model",
    ", the morphology of the simulated mini - halos is complicated and depends on observing frequencies , because the sloshing is temporary and the cr acceleration occurs in the region where turbulence is developing @xcite .",
    "thus , the radio emission could be strong even not at the cluster centre .",
    "this is not generally true in our model . because the radio emission tends to be strong at the cluster centre where the gas and cr densities are the highest .",
    "on the other hand , we do not think that our model can explain mpc - scale radio halos that are often observed in merging clusters without cool cores , because agns are active in cool cores , and dense gas in cool cores is required to produce the cr electrons .",
    "those mpc - scale radio halos may be produced by electrons accelerated in turbulence in the icm @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the stability of cr heating in clusters .",
    "the crs are accelerated at the central agns , and heat the icm through cr streaming .",
    "first , we obtained steady state solutions of the icm and cr profiles so that they are consistent with observations .",
    "the solutions are obtained when the magnetic fields are strong enough and their association with the icm is relatively weak .",
    "then , we analysed the stability of the solutions analytically and numerically . for the analytic approach",
    ", we adopted a lagrangian stability analysis and found that there are no globally unstable modes .",
    "for the numerical approach , we followed the evolution of the solutions for 100  gyr and confirmed that the solutions are quite stable .",
    "these results , as well as the consistency with radio observations ( paper  iii ) , make the cr heating an attractive solution of the cooling flow problem .",
