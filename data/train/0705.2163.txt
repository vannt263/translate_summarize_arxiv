    "the role of the external environment on the electronic properties of semiconductor nanocrystals has been raising a wide interest .",
    "this is due to an enhanced control of the synthesis techniques that allows for an optimization of the nanocrystal optical performances . in particular",
    ", it has been shown that silicon nanocrystals synthesized in organic solutions have a strong photoluminescence in the blue spectral region , opening the route toward biomedical applications of water soluble silicon nanoparticles.@xcite from the theoretical side , few studies have been done on the influence of the external environment on the semiconductor nanocrystal properties .",
    "indeed , while isolated nanocrystals have been studied in the past using the independent particle approximation,@xcite the role of local field effects ( lfes ) has been analyzed within quantum mechanical schemes only recently and for small structures.@xcite    a mixture composed of nanocrystals embedded into a dielectric background is usually described using continuum dielectric models ( cms ) .",
    "such models are based on the assumption that a nanocrystal can be approximated as a continuum medium with a defined position independent static dielectric constant ( it can be either the bulk value or a size dependent function ) , that abruptly goes to the background dielectric constant at the nanocrystal surface .",
    "a basic assumption of cms is that going from the nanocrystal center to the external background , the dielectric constant has a sharp discontinuity across the surface . in the case of non interacting nanoparticles ,",
    "these models reduce to the maxwell - garnett equations@xcite coupled to the clausius - mossotti equation for including the surface polarization fields.@xcite recent studies have shown that cms are not always adequate to give a fair description of small nanoparticles .",
    "in fact , by looking at the local permittivity profiles , it emerges that close to the surface there is a `` dielectric dead layer , '' and the matching between the dielectric constant inside the structure with that of the background takes place within a finite length@xcite whose value has a primary importance in the technological applications of semiconductor nanocrystals .",
    "the reduction of the local dielectric constant near the surface is thus the principal cause of the reduction of screening in nanocrystals , whereas the contribution due to the opening of the band gap has a minor role.@xcite moreover , in small and not well shaped nanocrystals , both quantum effects@xcite and atomistic features@xcite become significant , implying that calculations of lfes within atomistic , quantum mechanical frameworks are definitely required . unfortunately , the computational cost of this operation rapidly explodes with the nanocrystal size because of the need of computing a large number of excited states .",
    "this is the main reason why first principles methods can be used only for very small nanocrystals in a size range that is often significantly below that of the experiments.@xcite a good compromise between accuracy and the possibility of studying nanocrystals comprising thousands of atoms is obtained by using a real space approach . in the case of dynamic response calculations ,",
    "time dependent density functional schemes based on a real space , real time approach are the most promising tools for calculating ab initio the optical properties of confined systems with a favorable time scaling.@xcite    our choice in this paper is to use a tight - binding method for determining the dielectric response of confined systems .",
    "it is important to stress here that the tight - binding method must be intended in the widest sense and that is the use of a localized basis set .",
    "the general framework described in sec .",
    "[ sec : framework ] and the explicit expressions derived for both the independent particle polarizability and the real space dielectric function can be used with any localized basis set , including the maximally localized wannier functions.@xcite although the explicit expressions we derived in this work are very general , the applications we have done to illustrate the theory are limited to the simplest version of the tight - binding method where the hamiltonian matrix elements are fitting parameters determined by the material bulk band structure .",
    "we present numerical results for the optical and the screening functions of both silicon and indium arsenide nanocrystals .",
    "the good agreement between our results and the experimental data on one side and the results of first principle calculations on the other gives an indication that the chosen route for describing the dielectric response at the nanoscale is very useful .",
    "an interesting comparison of the nanocrystal polarizability calculated using the full tight - binding approach and the one obtained using the clausius - mossotti equation gives important indications about the range of validity of the dielectric medium theories .",
    "in the following , the linear response theory is reviewed using a localized orbital basis set .",
    "our derivation is based on the framework successfully applied by hanke and sham to bulk semiconductors.@xcite the main difference consists in the fact that the theory is here developed for confined systems that , as such , do not have periodicity . as a consequence ,",
    "a different procedure for the calculation of the dielectric constant must be employed .",
    "we will show that , neglecting local fields , the standard expression for the nanocrystal dielectric constant within the independent particle random phase approximation ( rpa ) is retrieved.@xcite instead , an expression is obtained when local fields are taken into account .",
    "we refer to the first approximation ( neglect of local fields ) as rpa , and to the second approximation ( inclusion of local fields ) as rpa+lf .",
    "since the main point we wish to address in this paper concerns the role of lfes in both the optical response and in the screening , we neglect excitonic effects . besides , while several interesting studies of the excitonic effects in nanocrystals have been done in the past,@xcite systematic studies on the influence of lfes are still lacking .",
    "the interest in this field is also motivated by studies of semiconductor surfaces done in the past , which showed the important role played by lfes in that situation.@xcite      as mentioned before , the tight - binding method is a powerful tool for the study of confined systems . although modern computational facilities and parallel programming lead the calculations to be much more efficient than in the past , first principles studies of nanocrystals containing several thousand atoms are nowadays an almost impossible task .",
    "the situation gets even worst if one needs to study the optical response of a nanostructure with the inclusion of local fields , since a calculation of a large number of excited states has to be performed.@xcite the tight - binding method has all the advantages of a formulation in terms of localized atomic orbitals whose most important feature is the use of a relatively small basis set , which implies a massive sparsity of the relevant matrices . with appropriate algorithms for the storage , diagonalization , and inversion of a matrix ,",
    "it is possible to implement an extremely efficient computational tool .",
    "the starting point is , of course , the diagonalization of the single particle hamiltonian .",
    "the nanocrystal wave functions are written as a linear combination of localized atomic orbitals , @xmath0 here , @xmath1 labels the atomic orbital symmetry and @xmath2 s are the atomic coordinates in the nanostructure . the implementation that we use in our calculations is that built on the third - nearest - neighbor @xmath3 parametrization ( with @xmath4 ) which has been shown to give a good estimation of energy gaps and effective masses of both silicon and indium arsenide , the two materials that we have chosen for illustrating the theory.@xcite we neglect the spin - orbit interaction and assume that the basis set is composed by real functions . in any case , a generalization to include the spin - orbit interaction is straightforward .",

    ", we make a number of approximations that are strictly related to the parametrization we have used .",
    "the first approximation is the neglect of the overlap between atomic orbitals localized on different sites .",
    "the very small impact of this assumption has already been checked in the calculation of the optical absorption spectrum of both bulk@xcite and nanocrystalline silicon.@xcite in both the cases , the agreement between the theory and the experimental data was very good .",
    "the second approximation consists in neglecting the off - diagonal intrasite contributions due to atomic orbitals with a different symmetry ( terms with @xmath18 in the @xmath19 s ) .",
    "on this point , there has been a wide discussion in the literature concerning the necessity of introducing additional parameters to take into account these contributions.@xcite our experience in this matter is that , apart from the theoretical problem of the breaking of gauge invariance,@xcite using a parametrization with many neighbors ( i.e. , third - nearest - neighbor parametrization ) makes the off - diagonal intrasite contributions negligible.@xcite    the third , most important approximation is in the use of a unique function @xmath20 for each atomic site , calculated by averaging all the functions @xmath21 at a given site .",
    "with this approximation , we are neglecting the dependence on the atomic symmetry so that the tight - binding labels reduce to @xmath22 .",
    "the averaging is simply given by @xmath23 our calculations show that these sets of approximations do not introduce significant errors in the rpa dielectric functions . within rpa+lf instead , it can induce an error in the calculation of local fields that , according to the quantity one wish to study , can be either neglected or not .",
    "for instance , we shall see below that these approximations are responsible of a small difference in the screening when our results are compared with density functional theory results .",
    "nevertheless , it must be stressed that eq .",
    "( [ eq : aaverage ] ) yields a huge simplification , since it leads to a significant reduction of the size of the matrix to be inverted . in the case of the @xmath3 parametrization , the tight - binding polarizability matrix @xmath24 is reduced by a factor of @xmath25 .",
    "it is important to underline the role of the si - h interaction parameters .",

    "the immediate consequence of this behavior is that the reduction of the dielectric constant in a nanocrystal with respect to the bulk , observed not only theoretically@xcite but even experimentally,@xcite has to be ascribed to a surface effect@xcite which has a dominant weight with respect to the band gap blueshift contribution.@xcite it is therefore evident that the surface polarization plays a key role in the dielectric response of confined systems . within a real space view of the problem",

    "we have shown that since local fields contribute significantly to the optical and screening properties of semiconductor nanocrystals , the use of an atomistic quantum mechanical framework has become absolutely necessary for the study of nanosized structures .",
    "the present framework is flexible , allowing the study of both optical and screening properties .",
    "it is computationally light and it gives results comparable to more sophisticated _ ab initio _ methods with good agreement with experimental data .",
    "the method has been applied to the study of the optical and screening properties of both indirect gap ( silicon ) and direct gap ( inas ) nanocrystals , with results that can be useful for deeper analysis .",
    "moreover , by using the present framework , we demonstrate that the continuum dielectric model , almost always used to take into account local fields , is not adequate to study the electronic properties of very small nanocrystals .",
    "this research is supported by the italian government through the cofin - prin 2005 project and the s.co.p.e . project .",
    "all the calculations have been performed at cineca-``progetti supercalcolo 2006 '' and `` campus computational grid''-universit di napoli `` federico ii '' advanced computing facilities ."
