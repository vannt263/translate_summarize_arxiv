    "among the parent compounds of the fe - based superconductors , cafe@xmath3as@xmath3 manifests unique physical properties and has become a model system for understanding high-_t_@xmath4 superconductivity in fe - based superconductors.@xcite the magnetic and structural phase transitions are strongly coupled and first order with hysteresis of several degrees as seen in thermodynamic , transport , and microscopic measurements.@xcite also , cafe@xmath3as@xmath3 is the most pressure sensitive of the afe@xmath3as@xmath3 ( a = ba , sr , ca ) and 1111 compounds with its antiferromagnetic / orthorhombic ( afm / orth ) phase transition being initially suppressed by over 100  k per gpa and a then non - moment bearing , collapsed tetragonal ( ct ) phase being stabilized by @xmath50.4  gpa.@xcite    previous work shows that the phase transition temperatures and even ground state of cafe@xmath3as@xmath3 can be controlled and tuned by post - growth annealing and quenching of single crystal samples.@xcite crystals of cafe@xmath3as@xmath3 grown from sn - flux and quenched from 600@xmath6c manifest afm / orth phase transition at 170 k. on the other hand , we found that crystals grown from feas - rich solutions , quenched from higher temperature ( 960@xmath6c ) exhibit a transition to the ct phase below 100  k at ambient pressure .",
    "further , we found that , for the feas - flux grown samples , a process of post - growth annealing and quenching can be used as an additional control parameter to tune the ground state of cafe@xmath3as@xmath3 systematically , suppressing the afm / orth transition temperature from 170 k to @xmath5 100 k and then stabilizing an ambient pressure ct phase by changing _",
    "t_@xmath0 from 350@xmath6c to 800 and further to 960@xmath6c . time dependence of annealing effects was studied to establish annealing protocols and the _ t_-_t_@xmath0 phase diagram was constructed .",
    "it was found that the _ t_-_t_@xmath0 and the _",
    "t_-_p _ phase diagrams are similar , suggesting that the effect of annealing and quenching is similar to that of pressure.@xcite based on the tem results , which reveal nano - scale , low strain precipitates in the sample with _ t_@xmath0 = 500@xmath6c and a strain field in the sample with _",
    "t_@xmath0 = 960@xmath6c , it is likely that the annealing and quenching process controls how a small excess of feas is brought in and out of the cafe@xmath3as@xmath3 matrix and , as a result , the amount of stress and strain built up in the samples , mimicing the modest pressures needed to stabilize the ct phase .",
    "having mastered the control of feas grown cafe@xmath3as@xmath3 , we are able to tune the ground state of this system with the combination of chemical substitution , annealing / quenching and application of hydrostatic pressure.@xcite the combined effects of co - substitution and annealing / quenching on the physical properties of cafe@xmath3as@xmath3 were studied and a 3d phase diagram , with co concentration , _ x _ , and annealing / quenching temperature , _",
