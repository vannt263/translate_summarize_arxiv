    "most expositions of dual model focus on its possible use as a framework for quark confinement in nature [ 1 ] . rather than the confinement of color charges",
    ", we will here describe what one might call the phase transition in the dual yang - mills ( y - m ) theory at finite temperature @xmath0 .",
    "it is believed that the energy required grows linearly with the distance between the color charge and anticharge due to the formation of a color electric flux tube .",
    "the idea is that a charge or anticharge is a source or sink , respectively , of color electric flux , which is the analog of ordinary electric flux for the strong interactions .",
    "but unlike ordinary electric flux , the color electric flux is expelled from the vacuum and is trapped in a thin flux tube connecting the color charge and anticharge .",
    "this is very similar to the way that a superconductor expels magnetic flux and traps it in thin tubes called abrikosov - gorkov vortex lines .",
    "+ there is a general statement that the color confinement is supported by the idea that the vacuum of quantum y - m theory is realized by a condensate of monopole - antimonopole pairs [ 2 ] .",
    "in such a vacuum the interacting field between two colored sources located in @xmath1 and @xmath2 is squeezed into a tube whose energy @xmath3 .",
    "this is a complete dual analogy to the magnetic monopole confinement in the type ii superconductor .",
    "since there is no monopoles as classical solutions with finite energy in a pure y - m theory , it has been suggested by t hooft [ 3 ] to go into the abelian projection where the gauge group su(2 ) is broken by a suitable gauge condition to its ( may be maximal ) abelian subgroup u(1 ) .",
    "it is proposed that the interplay between a quark and antiquark is analogous to the interaction between a monopole and antimonopole in a superconductor .",
    "it is known that the topology of y - m @xmath4 manifold and that of its abelian subgroup @xmath5^{n-1}$ ] are different , and since any such gauge is singular , one might introduce the string by performing the singular gauge transformation with an abelian gauge field @xmath6 [ 4 ] @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the angle subtended by the closed space - like curve described by the string at any point @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is responsible for the magnetic flux inside the string , @xmath11 being the y - m coupling constant . here , a single string in the two - dimensional world sheet @xmath12 , is shown , for example .",
    "obviously , the abelian field - strength tensor @xmath13 transforms as @xmath14 where a new term ( the dirac strength string tensor ) @xmath15 is valid on the world sheet only [ 5 ] @xmath16 actually , a gauge group element , which transforms a generic @xmath4 connection onto the gauge fixing surface in the space of connections , is not regular everywhere in space - time .",
    "the projected ( or transformed ) connections contain topological singularities ( or defects ) .",
    "such a singular transformation ( [ e1 ] ) may form the worldline(s ) of magnetic monopoles . hence",
    ", this singularity leads to the monopole current @xmath17 .",
    "this is a natural way of the transformation from the y - m theory to a model dealing with abelian fields .",
    "a dual string is nothing other but a formal idealization of a magnetic flux tube in the equilibrium against the pressure of surrounding superfluid ( the scalar higgs - like field ) which it displaces [ 6,7 ] .",
    "the lattice results , e.g. , [ 8 ] give the promised picture that the monopole degrees of freedom can indeed form a condensate responsible for the confinement . by lattice simulations in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , it is observed that large monopole clustering covers the entire physical vacuum in the confinement phase , which is identified as a signal of monopole condensation being responsible for confinement .",
    "the expression for the static heavy quark potential , using an effective dual ginzburg - landau model [ 9 ] , has been presented in [ 10 ] . in the paper",
    "[ 11 ] , an analytic approximation to the dual field propagator without sources and in the presence of quark sources , and an expression for the static quark - antiquark potential were established .",
    "the aim of this paper is to consider the phase transition in the four - dimensional model based on the dual description of a long - distance y - m theory which shows some kind of confinement .",
    "we study the model of lagrangian where the fundamental variables are an octet of dual potentials coupled minimally to three octets of monopole ( higgs - like ) fields [ 12 ] .    in the scheme presented in this work",
    ", the flux distribution in the tubes formed between two heavy color charges is understood via the following statement : the abelian higgs - like monopoles are excluded from the string region while the abelian electric flux is squeezed into the string region .",
    "it is strongly believed to the possibility for a quark - antiquark pair to form a bound state at temperatures higher that the critical one , @xmath18 , i.e. , in the deconfinement state ( see , e.g. , [ 13 ] and the references therein ) .",
    "one of the aim of this article is to find the analytical criterium constraining the existence of bound states at @xmath19 .    in the model",
    "there are the dual gauge field @xmath20 and the scalar field @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ; @xmath23=1, ... ,8 is a color index ) which are relevant modes for infrared behaviour .",
    "the local coupling of the @xmath24-field to the @xmath25-field provides the mass of the dual field and , hence , a dual meissner effect .",
    "although @xmath26 is invariant under the local transformation of @xmath27 , @xmath28 is an @xmath29-gauge dependent object and does not appear in the real world alone ( @xmath30 is the number of colors and @xmath31 stands for the cartan superalgebra ) . the scope of commutation relations , two - point wightman functions and green s functions as well - defined distributions in the space @xmath32 of complex schwartz test functions on @xmath33 , the monopole- and dual gauge - field propagations , the asymptotic transverse behaviour of both the dual gauge field and the color - electric field , the analytic expression for the static potential can be found in [ 12 ]",
    "phase transitions in dual models are associated with a change in symmetry or more correctly these transitions are related with the breaking of symmetry . as a starting point we assume , for simplicity , that the model is characterized by the scalar order - parameter @xmath34 = @xmath35 for the scalar field @xmath36 identified in the dual model as the higgs - like field .",

    "we now move to a simple physical pattern : let us define the `` large '' and `` small '' systems .",
    "it is known that in classical mechanics , the stochastic processes in a dynamic `` small '' system are under the weak action of a `` large '' system .",

    "we observed that the flux tube can be produced abundantly when the phase transition emerges at the temperature @xmath162 , obeying the condition @xmath248 .",
    "we found that the phase transition temperature essentially depends on @xmath108 and the mass of the dual gauge field @xmath61 .",
    "the analytic criterion constraining the existence of a quark - antiquark bound state at @xmath19 is obtained ( see ( [ e9 ] ) and ( [ e100 ] ) ) .",
    "we find that the coulomb string tension for strongly interacting particles in deconfinement increases with @xmath228 , and at short distances the coulomb potential has the linear rising .",
    "it is observed [ 16 ] that in wide range of higher temperatures , @xmath249 the non - perturbative screening mass @xmath83 is rather constant for both the @xmath250 and @xmath173 cases , and this mass is defined by the leading order perturbative result @xmath251 .",
    "this means an essential role of @xmath252 and the existence of heavy quark - antiquark bound states at temperatures above the critical ones in the framework of the dual gauge theory .",
    "it is the only the question , whether this result can modify the standard picture of finite - temperature gauge theory relevant to understanding of the quark - hadron phase transition and existence of strong qcd effect in deconfinement state .",
