    "quantum entanglement shared by two parties enhances their capability to communicate . in principle , it allows them to convey quantum information reliably through a classical channel ( quantum teleportation @xcite ) , to double the amount of classical information transmittable through a classical channel ( quantum dense coding @xcite ) , or to prepare at a distance states from nonorthogonal bases for secure communication ( quantum key distribution @xcite ) .",
    "these entanglement - assisted communication schemes are extendible to an arbitrary number of parties sharing multipartite entanglement . for instance , a sender may transfer quantum information through classical channels to several receivers as reliably as allowed by optimal cloning ( telecloning @xcite ) , or the parties may share quantum ( or classical ) information retrievable only when all parties cooperate ( quantum secret sharing @xcite ) . a more recent proposal that exploits the multi - party quantum correlations of multipartite entangled states is the so - called byzantine agreement protocol @xcite . in general , the presence of entanglement is verified through the success of a quantum protocol that would fail otherwise ( e.g. , quantum teleportation ) .",
    "such an operational criterion is only sufficient for entanglement and failure does not necessarily rule out its presence . in an experimental realization , however , before running through an entire entanglement - based protocol , it is desirable first to confirm that the generation of sophisticated multi - party entangled states has succeeded .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a simple but unambiguous experimental test to check for a particular kind of genuinely multipartite entangled states , namely those described by continuous variables ( cv ) and produced with squeezed light and linear optics .",
    "work in the direction of generating tripartite cv entanglement has been carried out already by sending one half of a two - mode two - party entangled state through an extra beam splitter with a coherent state or a vacuum state at its second input port @xcite .",
    "the resulting three - mode state was a side product of the bell measurement for the teleportation of coherent states using a preshared symmetric two - mode squeezed state @xcite .",
    "its tripartite entanglement was not further investigated in that experiment . in another experiment ,",
    "reported recently @xcite , the two - mode state was asymmetric , corresponding to two independently squeezed states combined at an asymmetric @xmath0 beam splitter .",
    "the output three - mode state after an additional symmetric beam splitter was then similar to the states proposed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "quantum communication , or more general quantum information with cv has attracted a lot of interest due to the relative simplicity and high efficiency in the generation , manipulation , and detection of optical cv states .",
    "although recent results suggest that these assets of gaussian cv operations ( phase shifting , beam splitting , homodyne detections , phase - space displacements , squeezing ) are not extendible to more advanced quantum protocols such as entanglement distillation @xcite , the simple and efficient cv approach still seems promising for many tasks and might be suitable for others too when combined with discrete - variable ( dv ) strategies . on the other hand , potential linear - optics implementations of quantum protocols solely based on dv utilizing single photons are restricted by no - go results such as the impossibility of a complete distinction between the four bell states @xcite . in order to perform such a bell measurement near perfectly with linear optics",
    ", one has to employ complicated entangled states of many auxiliary photons @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a bell and also a ghz state analyzer can be easily constructed in the cv setting using only beam splitters and homodyne detectors @xcite .",
    "how may one now verify experimentally the presence of entanglement without implementing a full quantum protocol ?",
    "we are here particularly concerned about the experimental verification of genuinely multipartite entangled states where none of the parties is separable from the rest ( in terms of the separability properties of the total density matrix ) . in general , theoretical tests",
    "might be as well applicable to the experimental verification .",
    "for instance , the violation of inequalities imposed by local realism confirms the presence of entanglement . proving genuine multipartite entanglement",
    ", however , requires stronger violations @xcite than those determined by the commonly used mermin - klyshko @xmath1-party inequalities @xcite .",
    "moreover , in any case , violations of bell - type inequalities using gaussian cv entangled states with always positive wigner functions must rely on observables other than the quadratures ( i.e. , position and momentum ) .",
    "photon number parity may serve as an appropriate dichotomic variable to reveal the nonlocality of the cv entangled states @xcite .",
    "this applies to the two - party two - mode epr - like @xcite and to the @xmath1-party @xmath1-mode ghz - like cv states @xcite .",
    "such an approach , however , is not very feasible due to its need for detectors resolving large photon number .",
    "the negative partial transpose ( npt ) criterion @xcite is sufficient and necessary for the bipartite inseparability of @xmath2-dimensional , @xmath3-dimensional @xcite , and @xmath4 mode gaussian states @xcite .",
    "a complete experimental determination of the state in question would also enable an npt check .",
    "in general , any theoretical test is applicable when the experimentalist has full information about the quantum state after measurements on an ensemble of identically prepared states ( e.g. by quantum tomography @xcite ) .",
    "such a _ direct _ verification of entanglement via a complete state measurement is in general very demanding to the experimentalist , in particular when the state to be determined is a potentially multi - party entangled multi - mode state .",
    "the multi - party entanglement criteria that we will derive here do not rely on the assumption of gaussian states .",
    "however , the states commonly produced in the laboratory are indeed gaussian and the theoretical classification of different types of multipartite entanglement becomes simpler for gaussian states @xcite .",
    "since the entanglement properties of a multi - mode multi - party state are invariant under local phase - space displacements , the multi - mode states may have zero mean and their wigner function is of the form @xmath5^{-1 } \\xi^{t}\\right\\}\\;,\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the @xmath6-dimensional vector @xmath7 having the quadrature pairs of all @xmath1 modes as its components , @xmath8 and with the @xmath9 correlation matrix @xmath10 having as its elements the second moments symmetrized according to the weyl correspondence @xcite , @xmath11 & = & \\langle(\\hat\\xi_i\\hat\\xi_j+\\hat\\xi_j\\hat\\xi_i)/2\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int\\,w(\\xi)\\,\\xi_i \\xi_j\\ , d^{2n}\\xi\\nonumber\\\\ & = & v^{(n)}_{ij}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 for zero mean values .",

    "as for the direct verification of entanglement via a complete state measurement , for gaussian cv states , the complete measurement of an @xmath1-party @xmath1-mode quantum state is accomplished by determining the @xmath9 second - moment correlation matrix .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath21 independent entries taking into account the symmetry of the correlation matrix .",
    "kim et al .",
    "@xcite recently demonstrated how to determine all these entries in the two - party two - mode case using beam splitters and homodyne detectors .",
    "joint homodyne detections of the two modes yield the intermode correlations such as @xmath22 , @xmath23 , etc .",
    "determining the local intramode correlations such as @xmath24 is more subtle and requires additional beam splitters and homodyne detections ( or , alternatively , heterodyne detections ) .",
    "once the @xmath25 two - mode correlation matrix is known , the npt criterion can be applied as a sufficient and necessary condition for bipartite gaussian two - mode inseparability ( where npt corresponds to a sign change of all the momentum variables with positions unchanged @xcite ) . in fact , the entanglement can also be quantified for a given correlation matrix @xcite . for three - party three - mode",
    "gaussian states , one may pursue a similar strategy .",
    "after measuring the 21 independent entries of the correlation matrix ( for example , by extending kim et al.s scheme @xcite to the three - mode case ) , the sufficient and necessary criteria by giedke et al .",
    "@xcite can be applied .",
    "let us examine the separability properties of ( in particular , three - party three - mode ) gaussian states in more detail .",
    "the criteria by giedke et al .",
    "@xcite determine to which of five possible classes of fully and partially separable , and fully inseparable states a three - party three - mode gaussian state belongs . hence genuine tripartite entanglement if present can be unambiguously identified .",
    "the classification is mainly based on the npt criterion for cv states .",
    "transposition is a positive map that corresponds in phase space to a sign change of all momentum variables , @xmath26 @xcite . in terms of the correlation matrix",
    ", we have then @xmath27 .",
    "since transposition is not a completely positive map , its partial application to a subsystem only may yield an unphysical state when the subsystem was entangled to other subsystems . expressing partial transposition of a bipartite gaussian system by @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 means the block - diagonal matrix with the matrices @xmath30 and @xmath31 as diagonal ` entries ' , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are respectively @xmath9 and @xmath32 square matrices applicable to @xmath1 modes at @xmath33 s side and @xmath34 modes at @xmath35 s side ) , the condition that the partially transposed gaussian state described by @xmath36 is unphysical [ see eq .",
    "( [ nmodeuncert ] ) ] , @xmath37 , is sufficient for the inseparability between @xmath33 and @xmath35 @xcite . for gaussian states with @xmath38 and arbitrary @xmath34 ,",
    "this condition is sufficient and necessary @xcite .",
    "the simplest example where the condition is no longer necessary for inseparability involves two modes at each side , @xmath39 . in that case , states with positive partial transpose ( bound entangled gaussian states ) exist @xcite . for the general bipartite @xmath40 case ,",
    "there is also a sufficient and necessary condition : the correlation matrix @xmath41 corresponds to a separable state iff a pair of correlation matrices @xmath42 and @xmath43 exists such that @xmath44 . since it is in general hard to find such a pair of correlation matrices @xmath42 and @xmath43 for a separable state or to prove the non - existence of such a pair for an inseparable state , this criterion in not very practical .",
    "a more practical solution was provided in ref .",
    "the operational criteria there , computable and testable via a finite number of iterations , are entirely independent of the npt criterion .",
    "they rely on a nonlinear map between the correlation matrices rather than a linear one such as the partial transposition , and in contrast to the npt criterion , they witness also the inseparability of bound entangled states .",
    "thus , the separability problem for bipartite gaussian states with arbitrarily many modes at each side is completely solved . for three - party three - mode",
    "gaussian states , the only partially separable forms are those with a bipartite splitting of @xmath45 modes . hence already the npt criterion is sufficient and necessary .",
    "the classification of tripartite three - mode gaussian states @xcite , @xmath46 is solely based on the npt criterion , where @xmath47 denotes the partial transposition with respect to one mode @xmath48 . in classes 2 and 3 ,",
    "any permutation of modes ( @xmath49 ) must be considered .",
    "class 1 corresponds to the fully inseparable states .",
    "class 5 shall contain the fully separable states .",
    "for the fully separable gaussian states if described by @xmath50 , one - mode correlation matrices @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 exist such that @xmath54 .",
    "in general , fully separable quantum states can be written as a mixture of tripartite product states , @xmath55 . in class 2",
    ", we have the one - mode biseparable states , where only one particular mode is separable from the remaining pair of modes .",
    "this means in the gaussian case that only for one particular mode @xmath56 , @xmath57 with some two - mode correlation matrix @xmath58 and one - mode correlation matrix @xmath59 . in general , such a state can be written as @xmath60 for one mode @xmath56 .",
    "class 3 contains those states where two but not three bipartite splittings are possible , i.e. , two different modes @xmath56 and @xmath61 are separable from the remaining pair of modes ( two - mode biseparable states ) .",
    "the states of class 4 ( three - mode biseparable states ) can be written as a mixture of products between any mode 1 , 2 , or 3 and the remaining pair of modes , but not as a mixture of three - mode product states .",
    "obviously , classes 4 and 5 are not distinguishable via the npt criterion .",
    "an additional criterion for this distinction of class 4 and 5 gaussian states is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , deciding whether one - mode correlation matrices @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 exist such that @xmath54 . for the identification of genuinely tripartite entangled gaussian states ,",
    "only class 1 has to be distinguished from the rest .",
    "hence the npt criterion alone suffices .    what about more than three parties and modes ? even for only four parties and modes ,",
    "the separability issue becomes more subtle .",
    "the one - mode bipartite splittings , @xmath62 , can be tested and possibly ruled out via the npt criterion with respect to any mode @xmath63 . in the gaussian language , if @xmath64 for any @xmath63 , the state can not be written in the above form . since we consider here the bipartite splitting of @xmath65 modes , the npt condition is sufficient and necessary for gaussian states .",
    "however , also a state of the form @xmath66 leads to negative partial transpose with respect to any of the four modes when the two pairs ( @xmath67 ) and ( @xmath68 ) are each entangled .",
    "thus , npt with respect to any individual mode is necessary but not sufficient for genuine four - party entanglement .",
    "one has to consider also the partial transposition with respect to any pair of modes . for this @xmath2 mode case , however , we know that entangled gaussian states with positive partial transpose exist @xcite .",
    "but the npt criterion is still sufficient for the inseparability between any two pairs . as for a sufficient and necessary condition",
    ", one can use those from ref .",
    "@xcite . in any case , in order to confirm genuine four - party or even @xmath1-party entanglement , one has to rule out any possible partially separable form . in principle , this can be done by considering all possible bipartite splittings ( or groupings ) and applying either the npt criterion or the stronger operational criteria from ref .  @xcite . although a full theoretical characterization including criteria for entanglement classification has not been considered yet for more than three parties and modes , the presence of genuine multipartite entanglement can be confirmed , once the complete @xmath9 correlation matrix is given .    rather than detecting all the entries of the correlation matrix we are aiming here at a simple check based on only a few measurements , preferably efficient homodyne detections .",
    "even for larger numbers of parties , this check should remain simple .",
    "though it may not yield full information ( e.g. , the complete correlation matrix ) about the quantum state of interest , it should still unambiguously verify the presence of genuine multipartite entanglement .",
    "this check may prove the presence of entanglement _ indirectly _ through measurements after transforming the relevant state first into an appropriate form via linear optics .",
    "in the two - party two - mode case , the necessary separability condition for any cv state @xcite @xmath69 ^ 2\\rangle + \\langle[\\delta(\\hat{p}_1+\\hat{p}_2)]^2\\rangle \\geq 2\\,|\\langle[\\hat x,\\hat p ] \\rangle | \\;,\\ ] ] can be tested , for example , with a single beam splitter . the position and momentum variables @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( units - free with @xmath72 , @xmath73=i\\delta_{lk}/2 $ ] ) correspond to the quadratures of two electromagnetic modes , i.e. , the real and imaginary parts of the annihilation operators of the two modes : @xmath74 .",
    "the beam splitter provides the suitable quadrature combinations for the positions and momenta simultaneously detectable at the two output ports . without beam splitter , just by measuring first both positions and subtracting them electronically , and in a second step detecting both momenta and combining these electronically @xcite , a more direct test of the two - party condition is possible .",
    "however , instead of a simultaneous detection of the relevant combinations , it requires switching the two local oscillator phases from position to momentum measurements . for an ensemble of identically prepared states , this sequence of detections would still enable the application of the two - party condition .",
    "note that the violation of eq .",
    "( [ 2partycrit ] ) is only sufficient for inseparability , i.e. , there are ( even gaussian ) cv entangled states that satisfy eq .",
    "( [ 2partycrit ] ) .",
    "any gaussian cv state , however , can be transformed via local operations into a standard form and the presence of entanglement would then always yield a violation @xcite ( alternatively , one may modify the inequality and leave the gaussian state unchanged to obtain a sufficient and necessary condition @xcite ) .",
    "the point is that the entanglement of states already in this standard form ( such as two - mode squeezed states ) can , in principle , always ( for any nonzero squeezing ) be verified experimentally by checking eq .",
    "( [ 2partycrit ] ) . a full determination of the correlation matrix , including elements such as @xmath23 which do not appear in the expressions of eq .",

    ", it would also enable quantification of the entanglement @xcite .",
    "the combinations in condition eq .",
    "( [ 2partycrit ] ) are exactly those detected in a cv bell measurement of modes 1 and 2 @xcite . thus , the verification of non - maximum two - mode cv entanglement may rely on measurements of observables that are detected for the projection onto the maximally entangled cv basis of two modes .",
    "now we investigate the @xmath1-party @xmath1-mode case in that respect .",
    "let us introduce the maximally entangled states @xmath75 since @xmath76 and @xmath77 , they form a complete , @xmath78 and orthogonal , @xmath79 set of basis states for @xmath1 modes . in a `` cv ghz state analyzer '' ,",

    "inferring from the two - party case , we may conjecture that the @xmath1 quadrature combinations given by @xmath85 provide a sufficient set of observables for the verification of ( possibly genuine ) @xmath1-party entanglement .",
    "just as for two parties , the variances of these quantities could then also be determined by combining the results of direct @xmath86 and @xmath87 measurements electronically .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that conditions for genuine multipartite entanglement can be derived based on the above @xmath1 combinations and additional assumptions such as the purity and the total symmetry of the state in question .",
    "later we derive a set of @xmath88 conditions for those @xmath1 combinations sufficient for the presence of genuine multipartite entanglement .",
    "this set is well suited for the experimental confirmation of the genuine multi - party entanglement of cv ghz - type states .",
    "no extra assumptions about the state are needed in order to close the loophole of partial separability .",
    "first , we discuss now what the structure of simple experimental criteria for multipartite cv entanglement might be .",
    "let us consider three parties and modes . the goal is to extend the simple two - party two - mode entanglement check to a simple test for genuine three - party three - mode entanglement .",
    "the criteria are to be expressed in terms of the variances of quadrature linear combinations for the modes involved . defining @xmath89",
    "a fairly general ansatz is @xmath90 as a potential necessary condition for an at least partially separable state .",

    "in contrast , for the biased states ( those with only one squeezer , @xmath219 and @xmath220 , and those with @xmath1 equally squeezed states , @xmath174 ) , the total variances approach or even exceed the boundary 1 as the number of parties grows .",
    "the example of the states with @xmath1 equal squeezers also demonstrates that there are gaussian states which are indeed genuinely @xmath1-party entangled , but do not satisfy any of the conditions in eq .",
    "( [ npartycritfinal ] ) .",
    "it can be shown , however , taking into account the symmetry and purity of the whole family of @xmath1-mode states ( including those with @xmath1 equal squeezers ) that all these states are genuinely multi - party entangled for any nonzero squeezing @xcite .",
    "finally , we emphasize that one may use other conditions too for verifying the genuine multipartite entanglement of the cv ghz - type states .",
    "even a single condition might be again sufficient . for example ,",
    "consider the combinations @xmath221 and @xmath222 for three modes .",
    "we have @xmath223=0 $ ] , and indeed the ghz - type three - mode state becomes a simultaneous eigenstate of @xmath158 and @xmath159 in the limit of infinite squeezing , @xmath181 .",
    "the boundaries of the total variance for these combinations take on the value one when @xmath192 or @xmath190 , and the value two ( corresponding to the fully separable state ) when @xmath191 .",
    "hence @xmath224 is sufficient for genuine tripartite entanglement .",
    "the number of measurements required , however , remain the same as for the criteria above expressed by @xmath88 conditions . in any case",
    ", both quadratures of all modes must be detected and combined in an appropriate way .",
    "in summary , we proposed experimental criteria to detect genuine multipartite continuous - variable entanglement .",
    "these are expressed in terms of the variances of particular combinations of all the quadratures involved .",
    "the combinations are measurable with only a few simple homodyne detections . for gaussian states ,",
    "it is then not necessary to determine the entire correlation matrix in order to confirm the genuine multipartite entanglement .",
    "furthermore , the conditions here do not rely on the assumption of gaussian states .",
    "an experimental confirmation of the gaussian character of the state in question is therefore not needed either .",
    "finally , we examined the applicability of the conditions to a particular ghz - type class of genuinely multi - party entangled states .",
    "these states are of gaussian form , they are totally symmetric under exchange of modes , and they have zero cross correlations between the @xmath86 and the @xmath87 quadratures . if they are in addition unbiased between the @xmath86 and the @xmath87 quadratures , they always ( for any nonzero entanglement ) satisfy the conditions in terms of appropriately chosen linear combinations . in the limit of perfect entanglement ,",
    "the variances of the combinations tend to zero for the unbiased states and the conditions are perfectly met .    in an experiment , one normally has approximate a priori knowledge about the state to be analyzed . according to this a priori knowledge , one",
    "can then choose appropriate linear combinations to be measured .",
    "it would be desirable to know whether there is always , for any given multi - party multi - mode state , a single optimal condition to verify its genuine multipartite entanglement and how to constructively derive this condition .",
    "inferring from the results here , such a condition may always exist and the corresponding linear combinations must contain both quadratures of all modes with optimized coefficients @xmath91 and @xmath92 . a possible approach to this question is in terms of so - called entanglement witnesses @xcite .",
    "one may then interpret the inequalities for the total variances as quantum expectation values of hermitian operators which take on negative values when they witness some kind of partial inseparability .",
