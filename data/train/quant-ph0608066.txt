    "in 1981 , dicke proposed a concept of interaction - free measurement ( ifm ) @xcite .",
    "however , current discussion of ifm appears from the following problem stated by elitzur and vaidman : `` let us assume there is an object that absorbs a photon with strong interaction if the photon approaches the object closely enough .",
    "can we examine whether or not the object exists without its absorption ? ''",
    "the reason that we do not want to let the object absorb the photon is that it might lead to an explosion , for example .",
    "elitzur and vaidman themselves present a method of the ifm that is inspired by the mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "then a more refined one is proposed by kwiat _",
    "et al_. @xcite .",
    "an experiment of their ifm is reported in ref .",
    "the ifm finds wide application in quantum information processing ( the bell - basis measurement , quantum computation , and so on ) @xcite .    according to the ifm proposed by kwiat _",
    "et al_. , the absorbing object is put in the interferometer that consists of @xmath5 beam splitters , and we inject a photon into it to examine whether or not the object exists .",
    "the probability that we can find the object in the interferometer arrives at unity under the limit of @xmath6 in the case where the interaction between the object and the photon is strong enough and perfect .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the ifm of kwiat _ et al_. with imperfect interaction . in ordinary ifm ,",
    "the absorbing object is expected to absorb a photon with probability unity when the photon approaches the object closely enough . however , in this paper , we assume that the photon is absorbed with probability @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) and it passes by the object without being absorbed with probability @xmath2 when it approaches close to the object .",
    "we estimate the success probability @xmath3 of the ifm , namely the probability that we can find the object without the photon absorbed , under this assumption .",
    "this problem has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite already . in ref .",
    "@xcite , although a correct approximating equation of the success probability of the ifm with the imperfect interaction is derived , its derivation is wrong .",
    "hence , we give a right treatment of this problem in this paper .",

    "et al_. for the ifm . ]    in the rest of this section , we give a short review of the ifm proposed by kwiat _",

    "next , we consider the case where there is an object that absorbs the photon on the paths @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that the object is put on every path @xmath7 that comes from each beam splitter , and all of these @xmath5 objects are the same one .",

    "if the incident photon goes to the lower right port of @xmath8 , it has not passed through paths @xmath7 in the interferometer .    therefore , the probability that the photon goes to the lower right port of @xmath8 is equal to the product of the reflectivities of the beam splitters .",

    "if there is no absorbing object in the interferometer , the photon goes to the upper right port of @xmath7 , and ( 2 ) if there is the absorbing object in the interferometer , the photon goes to the lower right port of @xmath8 . furthermore , if we take large @xmath5 , we can set @xmath3 arbitrarily close to @xmath19 .",
