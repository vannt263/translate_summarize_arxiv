    "( 2004 ) , using different selection criteria .",
    "prior to the availability of the spitzer data , which we will demonstrate is crucial in the interpretation , chen & marzke used the nicmos and acs data alone and identified these objects as candidates for evolved galaxies with photometric redshifts @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "yan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) used the goods irac data to identify 17 hudf objects with extremely red acs to irac colors ( `` irac extremely red objects '' ) .",

    "the observed sed of hudf - jd1 rises smoothly longward of the j - band , in contrast to the hudf - jd2 sed which is almost flat in the @xmath48 region ( i.e. a blue @xmath49 color ) , followed by a significant break in between the @xmath14 and @xmath50 wavelengths ( i.e. a red @xmath51 color ) .",
    "we will argue below that this distinctive feature , seen only in hudf - j2 , is strong evidence for a high redshift galaxy ( @xmath52 ) .",

    "x - ray observations of the goods - s field ( the 1 msec x - ray survey ) with the chandra x - ray observatory ( giacconi et al .",
    "2002 ) shows hudf - jd1 to be coincident ( within 1 arcsec ) with a faint x - ray source ( d.  alexander , private communication , based on an extension of the faint supplemental x - ray catalog from alexander et al .",
    "hudf - jd2 , instead , has no significant x - ray detection , with @xmath43 upper limits of @xmath56 and @xmath57 erg  s@xmath26  @xmath58 in the soft ( 0.5 - 2  kev ) and hard ( 2 - 8  kev ) bands , respectively .",
    "for the remainder of this paper , we will concentrate on interpreting hudf - jd2 .",
    "images of hudf - jd2 from 0.44 to 8.0@xmath5 m are shown in figure 1 .",
    "we carefully remeasured photometry for hudf - jd2 in each imaging data set through a variety of apertures , and using different sky background estimates , paying close attention to the possible contaminating effects of nearby neighbors .",
    "there are three faint , blue objects , visible at wavelengths as short as the acs @xmath21band , located slightly more than 1 arcsec from the @xmath29band centroid of hudf - jd2 . for large photometric apertures , these neighbors will significantly affect measurements in the nicmos @xmath28band or in acs , but they have relatively small effects in the @xmath29 band and at longer wavelengths .",
    "we have masked circular regions with diameter 0.5 arcsec around each of these sources before measuring photometry in the nicmos and isaac images , and use a smaller aperture which excludes them in acs .",
    "a portion of the spectral energy distribution of hudf - jd2 which will feature prominently in our later discussion is the `` break '' seen between the @xmath14 and 3.6@xmath5 m irac bands . since the signal  to  noise ratio ( @xmath59 ) in the goods isaac @xmath14-band image is less than that in the nicmos @xmath29 or irac images , it is important to verify that this is not an artifact due to measurement error .",
    "here we use a deeper ( 14 hour exposure time ) vlt / isaac @xmath14 band image of the hudf ( labb et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we calibrated the photometric zeropoint of the deeper image to that of the goods @xmath14band data by comparing measurements for 8 galaxies common to the two images .",
    "photometry was then repeated on the deep @xmath14 image , and we found excellent agreement with the measurement from the goods images within the nominal photometric uncertainties of the two data sets . because of its higher @xmath59 , we use the @xmath14 measurements from the deeper image here .",
    "we measured the @xmath60 band magnitudes through circular apertures with diameters as large as 3 arcsec , and found that the photometric curve of growth converges by a diameter of 2 arcsec .",
    "we examined the dependence of aperture magnitudes on different prescriptions for sky subtraction ( concentric annuli or median of the data in a local region ) and found that for aperture diameters of @xmath61 and smaller , these did not affect the measurements at a level greater than our estimates for the photometric uncertainty due to background shot noise . for the @xmath60 photometry , we choose 2  aperture diameters as a trade - off between convergence on the total flux , net @xmath59 , and the effects of systematic uncertainty in the background subtraction .",
    "we also verified the large ",
    "aperture @xmath35 and @xmath62 colors by comparing them to measurements through a smaller ( 09 diameter ) aperture using versions of the nicmos images which were carefully convolved to match the psf of the isaac @xmath14 image using a kernel derived by fourier techniques .",
    "the small  aperture measurements have higher @xmath59 and are less subject to sky subtraction errors , and the results were in excellent agreement with the large  aperture values within the estimated uncertainties .",
    "final photometric errors were computed from the sky noise , including corrections for pixel correlations induced by the reduction process , and with an additional term representing shot noise uncertainty on the net sky background .",
    "photometry in the acs @xmath42 images was measured through 09  diameter apertures centered at the position of hudf - jd2 derived from the nicmos @xmath29band image , and uncertainties were estimated based on the background shot noise ( which is uncorrelated in the acs hudf data ) .",
    "the object is undetected ( with @xmath63 ) in all bands .",
    "the irac photometry was measured with sextractor using 4  diameter circular apertures , and transformed to total magnitudes using aperture corrections based on monte carlo simulations in which artificial images of compact galaxies ( half  light radii @xmath64 , appropriate for this object ) were added to the irac images after convolution by the appropriate psf and recovered by sextractor .",
    "the results were the same within the expected errors when using smaller ( 3diameter ) circular apertures or sextractor mag_auto measurements .",
    "the three faint galaxies close to hudf - jd2 lie within the aperture used for irac photometry .",
    "however , these are expected to be too blue to make any substantial contribution to our estimated irac magnitudes .",
    "the baseline irac photometric errors were estimated from the same simulations in order to take into account the statistical effects of crowding in the data .",
    "the errors from the simulations ranged from 0.06 to 0.11 magnitudes in the four channels . in practice",
    ", we set a floor to the irac errors of 0.10 magnitudes in channels 1 through 3 and 0.15 magnitudes in channel 4 to also account for remaining uncertainties in the irac photometric calibration .    hudf - jd2 is also detected in the 24@xmath5 m mips image , as illustrated in figure  2 .",
    "emission from the foreground spiral galaxy @xmath65 to the southeast makes it necessary to carefully deblend the two objects .",
    "we have done this in two independent ways , using two independent reductions of the mips image . in one case ,",
    "we fit point sources to the 24@xmath5 m data at positions defined by the presence of sources in the higher - resolution irac images .",
    "we calculate the photometric uncertainties by quadrature summation over the residuals after the point source fits are subtracted . in this way",
    ", we measure a 24@xmath5 m flux density of @xmath66jy .",
    "we also measured photometry through small circular apertures centered at the position of the irac counterpart to hudf - jd2 , applying corrections to total flux computed from an in - flight 24@xmath5 m psf available from the spitzer science center .",
    "the smallest aperture that we used ( 4  diameter ) minimizes contamination from the neighboring spiral , but requires the largest aperture correction ( a factor of 4.8 ) .",
    "this yielded a flux density of @xmath67jy , while larger apertures were brighter , indicating increasing contributions from the neighboring spiral .",
    "we adopt the psf - fitting flux , but increase the uncertainty estimate to 20% ( 10@xmath5jy ) to reflect the difficulty of deblending these sources and to encompass the range of values measured by the different techniques .",
    "the mips cataloging procedure will be presented in detail in chary et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the photometric data used to construct the spectral energy distribution discussed in the next section are presented in table 1 .",
    "the difference between the nicmos ( jh ) and irac ( 8@xmath5 m ) hudf - jd2 magnitudes in table 1 with those presented in yan et al ( 2004 ) is mainly due to using differently reduced nicmos images , removal of the three nearby faint sources and the bright foreground galaxy in the field of hudf - jd2 and different photometric procedure in the case of the irac data .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of hudf - jd2 is presented in figure 3 ; the acs measurements are shown as @xmath68 upper limits . the sed displays a significant change of slope between the measurements in the mid  infrared ( 3.6 - 8@xmath5 m ) wavelength range and those in the near  infrared ( 1.12.2@xmath5 m ) .",
    "this change of slope is punctuated by a `` break '' observed between the @xmath14 and 3.6@xmath5 m points mentioned earlier .",
    "the sed declines shortward of 1.6@xmath5 m and is undetected in the hudf acs images . at the longest wavelengths",
    ", there is another change of slope in the sed between the irac and mips bands , with an upturn at @xmath69 m ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "as we will show in the next section , the photometry of hudf - jd2 at wavelengths shorter than 8@xmath5 m can be modeled as emission from an evolved stellar population seen at @xmath70 .",
    "the main evidence for this is the observed @xmath71 m break which is interpreted as the @xmath72  balmer break from an established stellar population",
    ". we will also consider old or dust - reddened stellar population models at lower redshifts .",
    "these models are illustrated by the spectra overplotted in figure 3 . in any scenario ,",
    "the measured 24@xmath5 m flux density exceeds that predicted by the stellar population models alone by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "this , and the distinct change of sed slope between the irac and mips bands , strongly suggest that the 24@xmath5 m emission from hudf - jd2 results from a different physical mechanism than that which is responsible for the bulk of the light at wavelengths shorter than 8@xmath5 m . this may arise from warm dust , complex molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , or may be a highly dust - reddened continuum source .",
    "we will therefore separately model the data at @xmath73 m (  4.1 and 4.2 ) and at 24@xmath5 m (  4.3 ) .",
    "any solution must provide an acceptable explanation for the 24@xmath5 m flux without invalidating the fits obtained for shorter wavelengths .",
    "we now perform detailed modelling of the observed hudf - jd2 sed in the range @xmath73 m , over which the flux is dominated by stellar component .",
    "we used two evolutionary synthesis codes in order to model the observed sed : starburst99 ( sb99 : leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ; vzquez & leitherer 2004 ) , and bruzual & charlot models ( bc03 : bruzual & charlot 2003 ) .",
    "the sb99 code has recently been extended to follow stellar populations to ages @xmath745 gyrs ( vzquez & leitherer 2004 ) .",
    "sb99 only supplies instantaneous and continuous star formation modes . for the bc03 , we used models with exponentially decreasing star formation rates parameterized by a time scale @xmath75 .",
    "a model with @xmath76 is thus identical to the instantaneous star formation in the sb99 models .",
    "for all models we used a salpeter imf with a lower and upper mass cut - off at 0.1 and 100 m@xmath77 respectively .",
    "we searched for the best model fit to the observed data by simultaneously optimizing the parameters of redshift ( @xmath39 ) , extinction ( @xmath78 ) , starburst age ( @xmath79 ) and metallicity ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the continuous star formation mode in the sb99 models could not produce an sed even remotely resembling the observed one , and was not considered further . in the case of the bc03 models",
    "we also include the e - folding time scale for a decreasing star formation rate ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the best fit parameters were found through @xmath81 minimization ( with 2 degrees of freedom- 7 data points and 5 parameters to fit ) , where we allowed all possible combination of model parameters in the range ; @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 gyrs and four levels of metallicity @xmath80=0.004 , 0.008 , 0.02 and 0.05 . for the bc03 models we used @xmath75=0 , 100 , 200 , 300 , 400 , 600 , 800 and 1000 myrs .",
    "we used the madau ( 1995 ) prescription for the mean neutral hydrogen opacity of the igm , and modeled dust extinction as a foreground obscuration screen at the redshift of the galaxy using the obscuration law of calzetti et al .",
    "as we will see , however , the best ",
    "fitting models have little or no dust extinction , so the choice of prescription for the reddening makes little difference on the final results .",
    "the parameters of the best fit models using the two different evolutionary synthesis codes are summarized in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "the results are very similar for both the sb99 and bc03 models , and we plot the best fit result from bc03 in figure 3 , together with the observed photometry .    when fitting broad band colors , there are degeneracies between parameters such as age , metallicity , extinction , and redshift .",
    "however , with seven significant photometric detections plus four upper limits , we find that there are sufficient data to limit most of these degeneracies . in figure 4 , we plot ( as a grey scale ) the minimum @xmath85 as a function of redshift and extinction , after marginalizing over the other free parameters .",
    "the global @xmath85 minimum is marked by an asterisk at @xmath86 and 6.5 for the sb99 and bc03 models , respectively , and @xmath87 for both sets of models .",
    "the best fitting redshifts are comparable to those of the most distant galaxies now known , although we note that the region of acceptable @xmath85 values is skewed towards still larger redshifts .",
    "the parameters not explicitly shown in figures 4 , such as starburst age and metallicity , do not vary much over the region defined by the 95.4% confidence level . hence ,",
    "only a small number of parameter combinations actually produce good fits of the model sed , and the redshift turns out to be quite robustly constrained , as also shown through monte carlo simulations (  4.2 ) .",
    "the stellar mass of the best ",
    "fitting models lies in the range @xmath88 .",
    "this represents a remarkably large mass for a high redshift galaxy , and we consider its implications in some detail in  6 .",
    "the metallicity of hudf - jd2 is not strongly constrained by the modeling .",
    "this can be seen by the fact that the bc03 and sb99 models yield different values for the metallicity , although most other derived parameters are very similar ( table 2 ) .",
    "moreover , given the low metallicity ( @xmath89 ) predicted by the bc2003 model , no gas and a high mass ( @xmath90 m@xmath91 ) , the object will not lie on any known mass - metallicity relation . to further explore this ,",
    "we fix metallicity to a relatively high value of @xmath92 ( solar ) and perform the fit to optimise other parameters .",
    "the best - fit gives @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 myr and @xmath76 with @xmath96 .",
    "acceptable fits can also be found for @xmath97 myr combined with small amount of extinction ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "as the age becomes progressively younger ( @xmath99 myr ) , there is an increased need for higher extinction with @xmath85 becoming monotonically worse .",
    "this is further confirmed by our monte carlo simulation results presented in  4.2 .",
    "figure 4 suggests that a dusty galaxy at @xmath4 also provides a possible , although less likely , alternative fit to the data .",
    "the best - fit parameters corresponding to this model are also listed in table 2 , and the model is compared to the observed photometry in figure 3b . in order not to violate the very stringent acs detection limits , this dusty model must also be a post - starburst object , without ongoing star formation . a foreground dust screen obeying the calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) attenuation law can not adequately suppress the uv flux from active star formation while simultaneously matching the near - infrared and irac photometry , although we note that steeper uv extinction laws might be able to accomplish this .",
    "if the 24@xmath5 m flux from hudf - jd2 is due to the presence of active star formation and not an agn , then this may appear to contradict the `` post - starburst '' nature of the fit to the acs - through - irac sed .",
    "however , more complex models with a highly obscured starburst or active nucleus plus a more lightly obscured , non - star - forming host galaxy , could conceivably fit the data . table 2 also gives parameters for another alternative model , which represents an unreddened , passively evolving older stellar population at @xmath100 .",
    "this gives a still worse fit to the data , poorly matching the break from the near - infrared to irac photometry , and violating the optical non - detection limits in some acs bands .",
    "a similar model dominated by old stellar population was also used by yan et al ( 2004 ) , deriving the same redshift of @xmath101 for the hudf - jd2 .",
    "however , this substantially overpredicts the observed k - band flux of the object and seems very unlikely .      to test the stability of the parameter values from the model fitting , and to better understand the relative likelihoods of the high and low redshift interpretations of hudf - jd2 , we have carried out monte carlo simulations , simultaneously varying the fluxes in all bands under the assumption that their errors are normally distributed and uncorrelated .",
    "we generated 1000 realizations of the data and fit each using the bc03 models .",
    "the distribution of the fitted values defines a probability distribution for each parameter , and is a better assessment of the most likely values . in figure 5",
    "we show the probability distributions for the redshift , stellar mass , extinction , and formation redshift ( @xmath102 ) values .",
    "the @xmath102 is calculated from the estimated photometric redshift and the age of the stellar population ( @xmath79 ) in hudf - jd2 , using the cosmology adopted here .",
    "the redshift distribution shows the same behaviour depicted in figure 4 , with a median probability around @xmath103 but skewed to somewhat higher redshift .",
    "as before , a less prominent peak is evident at @xmath104 to 3 , corresponding to a dust  obscured solution . in each panel of figure 5 , the parameter histograms corresponding to the low  redshift ( @xmath105 ) and high  redshift ( @xmath106 ) solutions are shaded differently so that the properties of each family of solutions can be easily distinguished .",
    "the distribution for extinction is strongly peaked at @xmath107 , with a small number of high values corresponding to the low  redshift solutions .",
    "for the high  redshift solutions , the distribution of stellar mass peaks around @xmath108 m@xmath77 , as for the best fit model .",
    "the starburst age ( not shown in figure 5 ) is evenly spread between @xmath109 gyr , where the upper limit corresponds to the best - fit solution in the previous section .",
    "the e - folding time is confined to 0.0 and 100 myr , i.e. , short compared to the ages of the models , while the preferred metallicity is 0.004 - 0.008 .",
    "considering only the high - redshift ( @xmath11 ) solutions , 95% of the monte carlo realizations have @xmath110 while 53% have @xmath111 .",
    "14% of models exceed the age of the universe at their best  fitting photometric redshifts and hence , are unphysical .",
    "the relatively narrow distributions for key parameters show that the stellar population model fits are stable and are not greatly affected by the photometric uncertainties . in particular",
    ", the redshift is one of the more robust parameters .",
    "age and extinction vary only by small amounts , and most of the best - fitting models have relatively small amounts of ongoing star formation , i.e. , with age @xmath112",
    ". old stellar populations at @xmath113 do not fit the data well .",

    "we estimate the expected colors of hudf - jd2 when passively evolving the @xmath93 sed fit solution to @xmath167 , the average redshift of the `` distant , red galaxies '' ( drgs)- ( van dokkum et al 2003 ; toft et al .",
    "2005 ) and the upper redshift limit of the bzk selected objects ( daddi et al 2004 ) .",
    "we predict @xmath209 ; @xmath210 ; @xmath211 and @xmath212 for hudf - jd2 when evolved to @xmath213 .",
    "this agrees closely with the observed colors of the drgs , estimated as @xmath214 ; @xmath215 and @xmath216 ( labbe et al 2005 ) .",
    "moreover , given the predicted @xmath14-band magnitude , such evolved objects will be detected in the k20 or bzk surveys .",
    "hudf - jd2 might be seen as a progenitor to such galaxies , and a sign that at least a few objects may have formed quite large masses of stars `` monolithically '' at very early times , and evolved quiescently down to lower redshifts .",
    "even if the source did not collapse monolithically but arose from several sub - galactic components which subsequently coalesced , it seems such early phases should be visible with future large  aperture telescopes such as the thirty meter telescope and the james webb space telescope .",
    "the mere existence of objects with such large star formation rates at very high redshift would have important implications for the re - ionization of the intergalactic medium , and we discuss this further in a companion paper ( panagia et al .   in preparation ) .",

    "<S> this non - detection helps limit the solution in which the galaxy is a starburst or active galaxy at @xmath4 , but does not rule it out . if the high - redshift interpretation is correct , hudf - jd2 is an example of a galaxy that formed by a process strongly resembling traditional models of monolithic collapse , in a way which a very large mass of stars formed within a remarkably short period of time , at very high redshift . </S>"
