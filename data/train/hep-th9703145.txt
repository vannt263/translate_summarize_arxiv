    "the seiberg - witten ( sw ) solution of @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills theory with gauge group @xmath1 and @xmath2 flavors of fundamental quarks , @xmath3 , is based on assumptions about the spectrum of bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) states in this theory , specifically the charges of the particles which become massless at the singularities of the moduli space @xcite .",
    "these assumptions have been partially checked by several different methods . in the weak - coupling limit ,",
    "semiclassical and adiabatic arguments lead to a description of the dynamics of slow , heavy dyons in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics on the moduli space @xmath4 of monopoles of magnetic charge @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 index theory on @xmath4 provides information about the spectrum of this theory @xcite .",
    "in particular , the existence of dyons of charge @xmath7 in the case @xmath8 is demonstrated .",
    "however , at present these methods require explicit knowledge of the metric on @xmath4 and the connection on the index bundle of the dirac operator over @xmath4 .",
    "therefore they are currently limited to charges @xmath9 .",
    "arguments based on monodromy at the singularities and the existence of a curve of marginal stability separating weak and strong coupling regions in the moduli space @xcite confirm that the sw assumptions are the only consistent ones , but do not directly demonstrate the existence of the assumed dyon states .    recently , another approach has been developed based on the derivation of the sw description from the low - energy limit of type iib string theory @xcite .",
    "the ten - dimensional string theory is compactified on a calabi - yau manifold which is a @xmath10 fibration over @xmath11 .",
    "this @xmath11  with its standard complex coordinate @xmath12 will be denoted @xmath13 .",
    "the relevant bps states in this theory are associated with d - branes wrapped around nontrivial 3-cycles of the calabi - yau manifold .",
    "their masses are given by the volumes of the cycles as measured by the holomorphic 3-form .",
    "at finitely many  branch points \" in @xmath13  the @xmath10 fibers degenerate by the vanishing of a 2-sphere .",
    "the relevant 3-cycles are either @xmath14 , where the first factor is in the fiber and the second in the base , or @xmath15 .",
    "the latter can be viewed as a singular case of @xmath16 , where the endpoints of the interval @xmath17 in the base are two of the branch points at which the @xmath18 vanishes . in the low - energy limit",
    "this information about the homology is captured in the sw riemann surface , which is also a  fibration \" ( branched cover ) of @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath10 fibers are replaced by discrete sets of points which may be thought of as two endpoints of a diameter of each nontrivial @xmath18 in the @xmath10 .",
    "pairs of these points coincide , and sheets of the riemann surface cross , over the same branch points on @xmath13  where an @xmath18 vanished .",
    "bps saturated states are d - branes wrapped around minimal volume cycles in their homology classes .",
    "this requires that the @xmath18 be minimal , and then that the @xmath19 or @xmath17 be ( the image in @xmath13  of ) a closed or open geodesic in the sw riemann surface for a metric induced by the holomorphic 3-form .",
    "this ( flat ) metric turns out to be @xmath20 , with @xmath21 the meromorphic differential 1-form of the sw theory .",
    "the homology class of the geodesic determines the electric and magnetic charges of the bps dyon state in the supersymmetric gauge theory .",
    "( strictly speaking , an open curve defines a homology class only relative to its endpoints ; reference to the calabi - yau setting shows that the charges can be defined by the intersection numbers of the geodesic with a homology basis chosen to avoid the endpoints . )",
    "these geodesics have been computed by numerical integration of the geodesic differential equation for @xmath22 @xcite , @xmath23 @xcite , and in some examples from f - theory @xcite . in most cases",
    "the results confirm the expected bps spectrum .",
    "however , the expected @xmath7 states for @xmath8 were not found in @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of the method is its sensitivity to the 1-form @xmath24 itself , not just its periods .",
    "we assume in this paper that the 1-form suggested by the integrable systems approach to sw theory @xcite is the correct one .",
    "this has been partially confirmed by deriving it from string theory for @xmath22 @xcite and @xmath25 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will describe an analytic method of determining the geodesics based on the conformal mapping to the flat coordinates for the metric , which is just a classical schwarz - christoffel mapping .",
    "the geodesics of course map to straight lines . for @xmath26",
    "they can be determined exactly at both weak and strong coupling , and the transition can be understood as a change in convexity of the image of the mapping . for @xmath27",
    ", they can be described to a good approximation in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "the qualitative behavior of the geodesics is easily understood in this framework , including the typical spiral behavior around branch points .",
    "the presence of @xmath7 states for @xmath8 is also clear despite the approximate treatment , although their absence for @xmath25 is less so .",
    "the distinction between even and odd @xmath2 is due to the symmetry of the sw curve @xmath28 under @xmath29 in the even case .",
    "our discussion is restricted to the case of massless matter .",
    "the sw curve can be viewed as a branched cover of either the @xmath12 plane ( @xmath13 ) or the @xmath30 plane ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "because the form of @xmath24 is simpler and more uniform in @xmath2 when expressed in terms of @xmath30 , we will generally work in @xmath31 .",
    "however , it is the @xmath12 plane which plays the distinguished role as the base of the @xmath10 fibration in the derivation from string theory .",
    "thus , the geodesics should join the branch points in @xmath13 , even if they are viewed in projection on @xmath31 .",
    "( this probably explains the failure of @xcite to find the @xmath7 states . ) for @xmath22 we will be able to describe the relation between the projections of the geodesics onto the two planes quite precisely .",
    "in section 2 we review some conformal mapping techniques , namely the schwarz - christoffel mapping and the schwarz reflection principle .",
    "section 3 recaps the sw curves for various @xmath2 , their branch points in both the @xmath30 and @xmath12 planes , and the differentials @xmath24 .",
    "section 4 treats the cases of even @xmath2 .",
    "the schwarz - christoffel mapping gives a simple and exact description of the image of the @xmath30 plane for real values of the moduli space coordinate @xmath32 .",
    "for @xmath22 we describe the geodesics in both weak- and strong - coupling limits , and the transition between these .",
    "the explicit mapping between the @xmath30 and @xmath12 planes is also described .",
    "@xmath33 exhibits the new feature arising from the presence of matter : the opening of a  window \" between the right and left half @xmath30 planes . because of the positioning of the branch points",
    ", it is not exploited in this case , however .",
    "still , we make use of the exact solution of this case to draw lessons about the behavior of the geodesics in such regions which can be applied to the remaining cases with matter .",
    "section 5 discusses the cases @xmath27 .",
    "these differ in the positioning of the branch points in relation to the window .",
    "unfortunately we can not identify any convenient region of the left @xmath30 plane whose image is bounded by straight line segments to which the schwarz reflection principle applies .",
    "therefore our treatment of the geodesics is less complete .",
    "however , we can say enough about their behavior to argue for the presence of the @xmath7 dyon states for @xmath8 .",
    "section 6 contains some concluding remarks .",
    "as this paper was being completed , additional works appeared in which analytic methods for determining the geodesics were proposed @xcite .",
    "the metric @xmath34 induced by the sw differential on @xmath31   is flat ; one can go to flat coordinates @xmath35 by the conformal mapping @xmath36 or @xmath37 in all cases of interest here @xmath24 has the form @xmath38 exhibiting zeros and branch points at the various @xmath39 .",
    "such a conformal map is an example of a schwarz - christoffel mapping @xcite . in our cases",
    "we will always have @xmath40 , so that the map approaches the identity for large @xmath30 .",
    "the image of a straight line under such a map can be determined by writing @xmath41 as @xmath30 moves along the line , @xmath35 moves along a curve whose direction is locally given by @xmath42 , hence determined by the variation of the @xmath43 .",
    "if , in particular , the @xmath39 are all real and we ask for the image of the real axis , then @xmath42 is piecewise constant , changing by @xmath44 as @xmath30 passes @xmath39 from left to right .",
    "the image consists of straight line segments joining the images of the @xmath39 .",
    "the image of the upper half plane lies to the left of this polygonal path .",
    "we will apply these ideas to slightly more general regions , namely quadrants .",
    "we recall also the schwarz reflection principle @xcite .",
    "this describes the analytic continuation of a conformal mapping across a straight line segment in the domain whose image is also straight . in the above context , if @xmath30 passes from the upper to the lower half plane across a segment of the real axis , the image point passes from the image of the upper half plane into a region which is its reflection across the particular boundary segment which is crossed .",
    "the distinct regions resulting from reflection across different segments display the monodromy properties of the mapping around the branch points .",
    "the hyperelliptic curves describing @xmath0 susy @xmath1 qcd with @xmath2 flavors of massless matter are given by @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xmath48 is the dynamically generated scale and the moduli space is the complex @xmath32 plane . in the weak - coupling limit @xmath49 which will be our main concern we can take @xmath50 in all cases",
    ". we will always consider real positive values of @xmath32 .",
    "we will also set @xmath51 .",
    "the change of variables @xmath52\\ ] ] brings the curves to the standard hyperelliptic form @xmath53    the polynomial @xmath54 has , of course , two double zeros at @xmath55 . for @xmath2",
    "even , the perturbation @xmath56 is negative at each zero and therefore splits the double roots into two pairs of real roots given for large @xmath32 by @xmath57 with the two signs chosen independently .",
    "these two pairs of branch points in the @xmath30 plane are related by the symmetry under @xmath29 .",
    "this symmetry is absent for @xmath2 odd , and indeed the perturbation is then positive at @xmath58 , which therefore splits into a pair of _ complex _ branch points , @xmath59 while the positive root still splits as above .    within the framework of supersymmetric gauge theory ,",
    "the seiberg - witten differential @xmath24 is not determined within its cohomology class . however , both the integrable systems approach @xcite and the derivations via the low - energy limit of string theory @xcite suggest the specific representative @xmath60 for our curves in the weak - coupling limit we find @xmath61,\\ ] ] although we will choose the normalization @xmath62 note the pair of zeros on the imaginary axis at @xmath63 in addition to the branch points at the above zeros of @xmath64 .",
    "generically , a distance measured by the metric @xmath24 is of the same order as the coordinate distance in the @xmath30 plane , the basic scale being set by @xmath65 .",
    "however , distances are increased near branch points of @xmath24 , e.g. by @xmath66 factors , and decreased near its zeros",
    ".    we will also need the ( finite ) branch points in @xmath13 , the endpoints of the relevant geodesics .",
    "these are the points @xmath12 at which @xmath67 has fewer than the generic number of solutions for @xmath30 . for @xmath68",
    "this generic number is two , and by the @xmath69 symmetry the branch points must occur for @xmath70 when @xmath2 is even . for @xmath22",
    "we find @xmath71 or , at weak coupling , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "for @xmath33 we have simply @xmath74 .",
    "for @xmath25 the solution for @xmath30 is @xmath75.\\ ] ] the branch points are the roots of a cubic equation and for large @xmath32 are given by @xmath76    for @xmath8 the generic number of solutions for @xmath30 is three , and there are branch points at which generically pairs of these coincide .",
    "they are the zeros of the discriminant @xmath77 of the cubic @xmath78 namely @xmath79.\\ ] ] the branch points are at @xmath80 , corresponding to @xmath70 ; @xmath81 , corresponding to @xmath82 and @xmath70 ; and the roots of the quadratic , which are approximately @xmath83",
    "the sw curve for @xmath22 is @xmath85 , or @xmath86 , and the conformal mapping which flattens the metric on the @xmath30 plane is @xmath87 the double zero of @xmath88 at the origin causes the map to locally triple angles there , so the map is not one - to - one on the upper half - plane .",
    "therefore it is convenient to study the image of a quadrant instead .",
    "figure 1 shows the image of the first quadrant and some of its schwarz reflections representing the fourth quadrant for weak coupling , @xmath89 .",
    "( all figures in this paper show qualitative behavior correctly , but are not necessarily strictly to scale . )",
    "the image of the imaginary axis is a straight line thanks to the symmetric placement of the branch points , which causes the changes in the @xmath43 to cancel as @xmath30 moves down this axis . reflecting across the imaginary axis",
    ", we see that the images of the first and second quadrants overlap in a rectangle , which is the region covered twice in mapping the entire upper half - plane .",
    "the sides of this rectangle are the sw half - periods , @xmath90 ( vertical ) and @xmath91 ( horizontal ) .",
    "the geodesics we seek are straight lines from @xmath70 ( the image of both branch points in @xmath13 ) to one of its reflected images .",
    "such geodesics can meet the branch cut joining the branch points on the positive real axis at most once ( at an endpoint ) , corresponding to the magnetic charge , but by passing through many reflected regions may cross the rest of the positive real axis an arbitrary number of times , giving arbitrary electric charge . in the @xmath30 plane , these geodesics are somewhat singular : they leave @xmath70 , spiral around the cut until they reach one of its endpoints , and then retrace the same path backwards to @xmath70 . by the @xmath29 symmetry",
    "there are similar geodesics in the left half - plane , but none which cross the imaginary axis .",
    "a small change in the initial direction produces a geodesic which loops around the endpoint of the cut rather than terminating there , follows almost the same path backwards , turns around just short of @xmath70 and runs out to infinity .        due to the simplicity of this case we can trace the geodesics back to the  physical \" @xmath12 plane .",
    "introduce an intermediate @xmath92 plane by @xmath93 the map from @xmath30 to @xmath92 doubles angles to expand the right @xmath30 plane to the entire @xmath92 plane , sending the origin to the point @xmath94 and the branch cut to @xmath95 $ ] . the map from @xmath12 to @xmath92 is a standard joukowski transformation sending the exterior as well as the interior of the unit circle to the cut @xmath92 plane .",
    "the branch points @xmath96 in the @xmath12 plane lie in the exterior and interior of the circle , respectively .",
    "the @xmath97 geodesics which met the cut now cross this circle and indeed join @xmath98 with @xmath99 , while the @xmath100 geodesics are now closed curves with both endpoints at , say , @xmath98 , as expected for the gauge bosons .",
    "these mappings are illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "we can also study the conformal mapping of the @xmath30 plane in the strong - coupling case @xmath101 and understand the transition as @xmath32 crosses @xmath102 , where the curve of marginal stability meets the real axis .",
    "as @xmath32 decreases , the branch points on @xmath31  move toward the origin .",
    "when @xmath103 the inner pair of branch points meet there , and the homology cycle encircling this pair vanishes .",
    "as @xmath32 decreases further these points separate along the imaginary axis , leaving one branch point on each half axis at strong coupling . in this process",
    "the homology cycle dual to the vanishing cycle is shifted by half its picard - lefschetz monodromy around the singularity .",
    "figure 3 shows the image of the first quadrant in this case . due to the change in convexity of the image region ,",
    "the only straight lines from @xmath70 to an image point which remain in the region are now the vertical and horizontal lines",
    ". these would represent pure electric or magnetic charges if not for the change in the homology basis which occurs in passing the singular point @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "in fact they correspond to the weak coupling states @xmath104 .",
    "we have thus understood completely the representation of bps states by geodesics in this case .",
    "the two - flavor case is very similar .",
    "we treat only the weak - coupling limit .",
    "the curve still has the @xmath29 symmetry which leads to a symmetric placement of branch points in @xmath31  and puts both of the @xmath13  branch points at @xmath70 . the major change in the mapping , @xmath105 is that the double zero of @xmath88 at the origin has split into two zeros on the imaginary axis .",
    "figure 4 shows the resulting image of the first quadrant .",
    "the part of the imaginary axis between the origin and the new zero is mapped to a small  window \" which can be crossed from left to right , leading by reflection into an image of the second quadrant . however , the geodesics which start and end at @xmath70 can not take advantage of this possibility , and behave just as for @xmath22 , as expected .",
    "( a geodesic which starts at @xmath70 and passes through the window may spiral around @xmath70 but will eventually run out to infinity . )",
    "the existence of the window will persist in the odd @xmath2 cases which are not exactly solvable by our methods .",
    "its size is @xmath106 but the numerical coefficient grows with @xmath2 .",
    "( its size relative to the vertical segment in the @xmath35 plane which is the image of the branch cut is @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 in the cases @xmath23 respectively . ) therefore , let us study the qualitative behavior of other geodesics in the present case , to develop intuition which will apply more generally . a geodesic which crosses the cut at a very small angle",
    "will then pass through many reflected regions in the vertical direction , meaning that it spirals outward around the cut many times .",
    "if it misses the window it will run out to infinity .",
    "if it passes through the window it enters the left half - plane and spirals inward toward the cut there , eventually crossing that cut .",
    "it then begins spiraling outward and the behavior repeats .",
    "very small changes in the initial direction of the geodesic can make it pass through any desired point on the real axis , and hit or miss the window . increasing the angle at which the geodesic crosses the cut decreases the number of spirals and thus the electric charge . at weak coupling the cuts are well separated from each other and from other features such as zeros , so the local spiraling behavior around the cuts should occur in all cases independent of other global differences .",
    "when @xmath2 is odd we lose the @xmath29 symmetry .",
    "the branch points in @xmath31  form a real pair near @xmath65 and a complex conjugate pair near @xmath111 . at weak",
    "coupling the separation between the pairs is large while the splitting within each pair is small ( absolutely so for @xmath25 , relatively so for @xmath8 ) .",
    "the image of the imaginary axis under the conformal mapping is not exactly straight due to the imperfect cancellation between the @xmath112 contributions of the pairs of branch points , but this effect is small .",
    "more consequentially , the image of the line @xmath113 through the pair of complex branch points is not straight due to the @xmath112 contributions from the zeros on the imaginary axis and the distant pair of branch points .",
    "figure 5 shows the images of the first quadrant and a region in the second quadrant bounded by the real and imaginary axes and @xmath113 .",
    "the important feature is the placement of the branch points from @xmath13  in the image .",
    "one lies on the branch cut near @xmath65 , one very near ( @xmath114 ) the origin , and one very near ( @xmath115 ) ) the center of the cut near @xmath111 .",
    "although we can not use schwarz reflection for the lines that are not straight , it should be approximately valid where they are nearly so .",
    "further , the local spiral behavior of the geodesics near the branch points is universal .",
    "geodesics leaving the  positive \" branch point cross the homology generator encircling the cut , which contributes @xmath116 to the magnetic charge . to obtain a state with magnetic charge 2 ,",
    "such a geodesic would have to pass through the window , cross the cut near @xmath111 , and end at the  negative \" branch point .",
    "the positioning of the negative branch point very near the cut makes it quite hard to hit .",
    "it requires that the image of the geodesic be a nearly vertical line which passes through many reflected regions before crossing the window .",
    "however , it then enters the second ( or third ) quadrant and crosses the line @xmath113 far from the branch points , where the reflection principle does not apply .",
    "we conclude cautiously that there is no evidence for states of magnetic charge 2 in the one - flavor theory , although charges 0 and 1 exist .",
    "the placement of the branch points for @xmath8 is quite different , as shown in figure 6 .",
    "most branch points have two images in @xmath31  , and their locations are more generic in that they are not unnaturally close to branch cuts .",
    "this allows them to be connected by lines whose slopes are not unnaturally large .",
    "in addition to a variety of @xmath117 states , there are now geodesics which leave one of the branch points on the positive real axis , cross the cut there , pass through the ( larger ) window , cross the cut in the left half - plane and spiral around it until they end on a branch point there , crossing boundaries only where they are straight to a good approximation .",
    "therefore the existence of these geodesics seems reliable despite the approximation . in terms of the qualitative behavior of geodesics gleaned from the @xmath33 case , given that geodesics exist which cross both cuts , small perturbations suffice to make them pass through arbitrary points not too far away , including the desired branch endpoints .",
    "we have used simple conformal mapping techniques to determine the geodesics corresponding to the bps states of @xmath0 supersymmetric qcd with gauge group @xmath1 , exactly for even @xmath2 and approximately at weak coupling for odd @xmath2 .",
    "qualitative features of the geodesics such as the typical spiral behavior around branch cuts become transparent in this approach . the important changes as @xmath2",
    "is increased involve the placement of the branch points on @xmath13  relative to those on @xmath31 .",
    "the transition between weak and strong coupling involves a change in convexity of the image region , which obviously alters the set of straight lines which can connect boundary points .",
    "although we considered only real positive values of @xmath32 , for which the classical schwarz - christoffel mapping applies , even when @xmath32 is complex the convexity of the image region can only change upon crossing the curve of marginal stability .",
    "indeed , the arguments of @xcite concerning the spectrum outside and inside this curve could be directly rephrased as arguments about the behavior of the geodesics in these regions .    in our treatment",
    "it is quite clear that for @xmath26 the maximum magnetic charge of an elementary bps state is 1 . for @xmath2 odd",
    "the maximum charge is 2 .",
    "such states seem to exist for @xmath8 due to the  generic \" placement of the branch points , which allows them to be connected by straight lines without unnatural  fine - tuning \" . for @xmath25 , fine - tuning",
    "would be necessary to obtain such states but our approximations are not reliable for such fine - tuned lines .",
    "no such states are found in numerical studies @xcite .",
    "these methods should be applicable to @xmath0 theories with other gauge groups , possibly with massive matter .",
    "the main requirement is that there exist a region of the moduli space in which all branch points on @xmath31  are real , or nearly so .",
    "symmetries relating the branch points are also very useful .",
    "one may hope that with analytic understanding of the geodesic description of bps states will come an understanding of the relation between this description and that of @xmath6 index theory .",
