    "this article revisits an integral where the integrand takes the form of radical trigonometric functions . a general form of radical trigonometric integrands in the context of this article refers to @xmath2 or @xmath3 , for @xmath4 .",
    "the integral of these functions is expressed in terms of elliptic integral and are available in mathematical handbooks and tables of integrals .",
    "for example , the latter integral is given in section 2.5 ( see 2.576 ) of a famous mathematical handbook by gradstyen and ryzhik  @xcite .",
    "for a particular case of @xmath5 , after removing the constant factor , the integrand reduces to radical trigonometric functions @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , it seems that explicit expressions for the integral of these functions have not been specifically listed in any tables of integrals and handbooks , including , but not limited to ,  @xcite .",
    "the focus of this article is to consider the special case when @xmath6 , where several techniques of integration are discussed in a more detail . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first time when such a compilation for particular integrands is presented .",
    "the motivation of this article springs from an encounter from one of the coauthors in teaching calculus  2 course during the spring 2014 semester in nazarbayev university , astana , kazakhstan .",
    "particularly , the content of this article is related to the topic on the integral calculus of polar curves , and one of the examples is calculating the length of a cardioid .",
    "we adopt the calculus textbook written by anton , bivens and davis  @xcite where the polar curves are discussed in section 10.3 . another recommended textbook reading for this course is the one written by stewart  @xcite .",
    "an example [ example 4 , section 10.4 , page 692 ] from the latter textbook mentions that finding the length of cardioid @xmath7 can be evaluated by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator of the integrand by @xmath8 or alternatively , using the computer algebra system ( cas ) . yet , evaluating this integral by hand is apparently not so obvious to many students since they have to do further manipulation on the obtained expression .",
    "the screenshot of the example from stewart s textbook has been excerpted and displayed in figure  [ example ] .    after rationalizing the numerator and implementing the pythagorean trigonometric identity",
    ", the numerator simplifies to @xmath9 , but it has to be in absolute value form , instead of simply @xmath10 .",
    "this is a common mistake found among students since they may forget or tend to ignore the absolute value sign . from an instructor s perspective , it is imperative to remind the students to be aware of this fact .",
    "referring to bloom s taxonomy of learning domains  @xcite , the educational activity of this learning process is the _ cognitive domain_. the process covers _ knowledge _ , _ comprehension _ and _ application_. in this example , students possess the knowledge that any value of the square root must be non - negative and an absolute value of any quantity is always non - negative too .",
    "a comprehension of these facts is essential to conclude ( application of knowledge ) that the square root of a quantity squared is indeed equal to the absolute value of that quantity .",
    "referring to the revised bloom taxonomy  @xcite , a connection between learning activities and learning objectives can further be established .",
    "the knowledge dimension covers the _ factual _ and _ conceptual _ aspects . in this context",
    ", students must know the definition of an absolute value and be able to make an interrelationship between the property of a square root and the absolute value .",
    "the cognitive dimension includes _ remember , understand , apply _ aspects . possessing the knowledge of absolute value",
    ", it is crucial to investigate whether the students can retrieve this knowledge from their memory , whether they understand why absolute value has to be non - negative and whether they are able to simplify and conclude that @xmath11 .",
    "where the calculation details are omitted.,scaledwidth=99.0% ]    another educational aspect of the integral involving radical trigonometric functions is related to the _ synthesis _ skill of _ cognitive domain _ in bloom s taxonomy . in the revised bloom s taxonomy ,",
    "the educational content involves _ factual _ and _ conceptual _ aspects of the _ knowledge _ dimension , where students attempt to make interrelationships among the basic elements of trigonometric functions . the _ cognitive process _",
    "dimension covers _ remember , understand , apply _ and _ analyze _ aspects .",
    "when this example is posed to the classroom for the students to work on , it turns out that some excellent students come up with different techniques by manipulating the integrand expression .",
    "this shows that different students approach the problem distinctly , they attempt to integrate with the method which is most convenient to them . for instance , for some students , the technique of trigonometric substitution is a more comfortable approach , others implement a variable shift method to solve the problem successfully .",
    "thus , there are several ways by which students can approach the problem .    for many calculus instructors ,",
    "however , the interest in integration techniques has waned . with the introduction of cas ,",
    "many of them now give only cursory attention to such techniques .",
    "nevertheless , the methods of integration covered in this article are still interesting from educational perspective .",
    "they provide a valuable pedagogical tool to assist and improve the students learning skills , which are beneficial to both the instructors and the students themselves alike . in particular , by introducing several methods during class sessions , the techniques covered in this article become useful in the sense that it does not only expose the students to various techniques of integration but also makes them review and strengthen their knowledge of trigonometry and trigonometric functions . as can be observed later",
    ", this article recalls some important properties of trigonometric functions of sine , cosine and tangent as well as a significant application of trigonometric substitution in solving particular types of integration .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "the following section covers the integral of radical sine function @xmath0 .",
    "section  [ cosine ] briefly covers the integral of radical cosine function @xmath1 .",
    "several techniques of integration are covered and more detailed derivations are discussed in section  [ sine ] , including rationalizing numerator , combining trigonometric identities , twice trigonometric substitutions and variable shift methods .",
    "all of these methods require some variations of integrating absolute value function , which will be presented accordingly in the corresponding subsections .",
    "section  [ cardioid ] presents an application where the integrals of radical sine and cosine functions appear , particularly in calculating the length of a cardioid .",
    "the final section draws conclusions and provides remark to our discussion .",
    "this section deals with the integral of a radical sine function where the integrand takes the form @xmath0 .",
    "there are a number of methods to obtain the result , and four techniques are covered in this section .",
    "the first method is by rationalizing the numerator . from here",
    ", one may depart either to use the pythagorean identity or to employ a trigonometric substitution .",
    "the second method is by combining several trigonometric identities .",
    "we observe that double - angle formula and the identity relating @xmath12 and @xmath13 follow different paths of calculation and yet arrive at identical expression .",
    "the third technique is by implementing trigonometric substitutions two times , mainly using tangent function .",
    "finally , the fourth technique is conducted by shifting the variable by @xmath14 .",
    "two options can be developed from this path , where both of them alter the integral from radical sine function into radical cosine function .",
    "the four methods covered in this section are summarized in the following tree diagram .    [ .",

    "a similar solution can also be obtained using the trigonometric substitution of @xmath30 . differentiating with respect to @xmath31 , we get @xmath32 , where the positive and negative signs are related to the sign of @xmath33 .",

    "let @xmath18 be a function which has at most one root on each interval on which it is defined , and @xmath19 an antiderivative of @xmath18 that is zero at each root of @xmath18 ( such an antiderivative exists if and only if the condition on @xmath18 is satisfied ) , then @xmath36 \\ , f(x ) + c , \\label{av2}\\ ] ] where sgn@xmath37 is the sign function defined previously .",

    "writing @xmath38 and using the double - angle formula for @xmath12 : @xmath39 , the integral of the radical sine becomes @xmath40 where the last expression is quickly obtained after implementing  .",
    "a similar result will also be obtained if one employs another trigonometric identity that relates @xmath12 and @xmath15 . using the double - angle formula for @xmath12 at the numerator and the pythagorean trigonometric identity at the denominator , dividing both sides by @xmath41",
    ", we obtain @xmath42 thus , the integral of the radical sine function @xmath26 turns to @xmath43      a similar expression of the solution as that of the previous section can also be obtained by the trigonometric substitution @xmath44 .",
