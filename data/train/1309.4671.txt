    "a model to include gravity in the standart model extension ( sme ) @xcite is provided by a vector field @xmath0 , the so - called bumblebee field , which couples with the usual geometrical tensors through the action @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 inspite this model introduces the lorentz violation into the geometry @xcite , the geometrical tensors remain lorentz - invariants . this drawback can be overcame by means of the finsler geometry @xcite .",
    "a finsler geometry is an extension of the riemannian geometry where given a curve @xmath4\\rightarrow m$ ] , its arc length is given by @xcite    @xmath5    where , @xmath6 .",
    "the function @xmath7 is called the finsler principal function .",
    "note that the interval depends both on the position @xmath8 as on the direction @xmath9 .",
    "as in the riemannian case , it is possible to define a finsler metric by @xcite @xmath10    the finsler metric ( [ finslermetric ] ) is a symmetric and an anisotropic quadratic form on @xmath11 . differenting the metric yields the so - called cartan tensor @xmath12 from which it is possible to define a nonlinear connection by @xmath13 which decouples @xmath11 into @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the basis for the horizontal section @xmath16 and @xmath17 is a base for the vertical section @xmath18 .",
    "the compatible cartan connection is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20@xcite .",
    "following the approach proposed by pfeifer and wohlfarth @xcite , here we are concerned with only the lorentz violation effects on tensor fields defined on @xmath16 .",
    "the horizontal ricci curvature is defined as @xcite    @xmath21    and the scalar curvature @xmath22 .",
    "based in a previous work on the classical point particles lagrangians @xcite , kostelecky proposed a new finsler function of form @xcite    @xmath23    where @xmath24 the planck length scale @xmath25 provides a scale of length where the anisotropic effects have to be taken in account .",
    "kostelecky , russel and tso supposed @xmath26 and enhanced the @xmath27 tensor to be any symmetrical one @xcite .",
    "this geometry is so - called bipartite .",
    "the bipartite - finsler function yields the finsler metric @xcite    @xmath28    where , @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath30 , the relation between the finslerian and lorentzian volume element is given by @xmath31",
    "assuming the dynamics of the space - time is governed by an einstein - hilbert action then , @xmath32 it is possible to regain some interaction terms of the bumblebee model action ( [ bumblebeeactioninteraction ] ) .",
    "as a perspective we expect to obtain the dynamical terms of the bumblebee model and some other interaction terms as well .",
