    "the _ hst _ exposure times were chosen to probe intrinsic depths @xmath32 fainter than the hudf in the highest magnification regions of the lensed fields , but with significantly less time than blank field observations .",
    "the volumes probed at the highest magnifications are very small ( see coe , bradley , & zitrin 2015 ) , thus the program observes multiple clusters to improve the statistical likelihood of capturing the light from the faintest and most distant galaxies . while color , redshift , and other relative measures such as specific star - formation rates and emission - line equivalent widths are immune to errors in the magnification estimates , measurements of the intrinsic luminosities and sizes of individual objects depend directly on the inferred lensing magnifications .",

    "however , in reducing the observations for the first epoch of abell 2744 , we found that the final combined images were greatly enhanced when `` self - calibrated '' to remove the signature of trails in the darks and other detector - related sources of noise ( also ogaz , avila , & hilbert 2015 ) .",

    "strong magnification is predicted , each epoch of observations is constrained to a fixed hst roll angle with small dithers between exposures .",

    ", we used an inter - visit dither pattern that displaced any given two visits by @xmath153 _",
    "wfc3/ir _ pixel ( @xmath2 0.13 ) while still retaining overall compactness .",
    "this was achieved by generating 35 pseudo - random dither locations from a 2d sobol sequence covering a 6-pixel square . at the same time , pixel - phase dithering was achieved by modulating this 6 pixel pattern by a secondary 35-element 2d sobol sequence sampling over pixel phase .",
    "pairings of acs and wfc3 filters were carefully matched to visit - specific dither locations such that no filter had a pile - up of exposures in either absolute location or in pixel phase .",
    "the _ hst _ dithering within the frontier fields visits , comprising four half - orbit exposures per filter , used the standard wfc3/ir `` ir - dither - blob '' .",
    "this intra - visit dither pattern had several attractive features , including : good intra - visit subpixel phase sampling for _ wfc3/ir _ ; stepping across _ wfc3/ir _ `` blobs '' of reduced detector sensitivity ; and stepping across the _ acs / wfc _ ccd gap .",
    "this intra - visit dither pattern is also sufficient to reject cosmic ray impacts marring the four half - orbit _ acs _ exposures .",
