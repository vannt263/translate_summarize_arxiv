    "entanglement is one of the most remarkable features of quantum mechanics and has many practical applications in quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "however , realistic quantum systems are inevitably influenced by the surrounding environment , which always leads to decoherence of the quantum states . particularly , the thermal field is frequently discussed in this problem .",
    "a thermal field , which is emitted by a source in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath0 , is a highly chaotic field with minimal information about its mean value of the energy .",
    "however , such a chaotic field can entangle qubits that are prepared initially in a separable state  @xcite , lead to entangled states in the interaction of a single qubit in a pure state with a thermal field regardless of the temperature of the field and reduce the system to a mixed state when the field variables are traced over  @xcite .",
    "the influence of the thermal field strength on the atom - atom entanglement  @xcite and atom - field entanglement  @xcite have also been investigated .",

    "jin  @xcite suggested a scheme of teleporting a two - atom entangled state with a thermal cavity and the success probability can reach @xmath1 .    in this paper , we consider two isolated two - level atoms each interacting with a single - mode thermal cavity field .",
    "the effects of the atomic motion and the field - mode structure are considered at the same time . the atomic motion and the field - mode structure not only lead to nonlinear transient effects in the atomic population  @xcite , which are similar to self - induced transparency and adiabatic effects , but also give rise to the periodic evolution of the entropy squeezing  @xcite , the field entropy , the atomic inversion  @xcite and the entanglement  @xcite .",
    "other effects by regulating the field - mode structure parameters have also been observed , e.g. decreasing the squeezing in the two - photon jc model  @xcite , operating the entanglement and realizing the quantum gate operation  @xcite .",
    "the recent cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments which use an atomic beam passing along the axis of a rectangular or cylindrical cavity provide the feasibility of discussing the different field mode structures  @xcite .",
    "then , in the present work , we are interested in the effects of the atomic motion and the field - mode structure on the time evolution of the atomic state in thermal cavity field environment .",
    "we suppose the two atoms are initially prepared in one of the bell states , which is a maximal entangled pure state .",
    "the previous studies of maximally entangled states usually use entanglement , purity and energy to characterized the set of two - qubit states  @xcite . as the atom - field interacting process accompanied by exchanging excitations between atoms and fields ,",
    "the energy in the system is a direct influences on the entanglement and mixedness properties . on the other hand ,",
    "the initial pure state of the atomic qubits must be influenced by interacting with a thermal cavity environment , so the mixedness is an important characteristic in the process of entanglement evolution . as a result",
    ", we will investigate the time evolution of the entanglement , purity and energy via manipulating of the field - mode structure parameters , the strength of the thermal field and the detunings between atoms and thermal cavity fields .",

    "we propose the algebraic dynamical approach to derive the time evolution operator and the density operator based on the hamiltonian ( 1 ) .",
    "the key idea of the algebraic dynamical approach is introducing a canonical transformation operator that transforms the hamiltonian into a liner function in terms of a set of lie algebraic generators . according to algebraic dynamics , linear systems are integrable and solvable , then the time evolution operator and the density operator can be obtained easily . in the case of symmetric atom - field interaction ,",
    "the two subsystems are completely equivalent . for simplicity",

    "in this paper , we employed three parameters  entanglement , purity and energy to describe the information about two distant atoms which are initially prepared in bell state .",
    "our results showed that considering the atomic motion and the field - mode structure can lead to the periodic evolution of entanglement , purity and energy . with the increase of field - mode structure parameter @xmath31 , both their evolution periods and their amplitudes",
    "are decreased while their maximum values are unchanged . however",
    ", strong thermal field can reduce the peak values of entanglement , purity and energy of the atomic qubits and make the atomic state initially in a pure state to mixed states .",
    "meanwhile , in such a chaotic field , energy transfer between atoms and fields is more and more less with the increase of thermal field strength .",
    "in addition , large detuning is in favour of reducing their oscillation time and `` frozing '' the initial maximal entanglement state in the atomic subsystem .",
    "we also analyzed the possible state that the atomic qubits may evolves into . from the entanglement - purity - entanglement diagram we found that the disentanglement process for the atomic subsystem accompanies both by the excitation transferring from atomic subsystem to cavity field modes and the state converts from a pure state to mixed states .",
    "our number results showed that , when the atomic state is in the maximal entanglement state , it is in a pure state at the same time ; when the two atoms are separable , the atomic state is in a mixed state .",
    "however , in the atom - field interacting process , the state for atomic qubits can not evolve to the maximal entanglement mixed state .",
