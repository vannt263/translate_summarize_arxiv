    "since its introduction more than 100 years ago , brownian motion has remained a valuable and versatile tool to study a wide variety of physical systems . in recent years",
    "considerable efforts have been devoted to its extension and reliable implementation for relativistic systems  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been applied in the studies of heavy - quark ( hq ) diffusion in the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp )  @xcite , in order to evaluate transport properties of the medium produced in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions ( urhics ) ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) . since charm- and bottom - quark masses are much larger than the typical temperatures , as well as the constituent masses of the equilibrated medium , a separation of the hq relaxation time and collision time emerges  @xcite , thus justifying a soft - collision approximation to be accommodated by fokker - planck dynamics  @xcite . in practice , the fokker - planck equation is routinely realized by stochastic langevin processes  @xcite . however , it is known that the implementation of the langevin equation is not unique but depends on the realization of the stochastic integral , resulting in ( seemingly ) different fokker - planck equations , known as the `` ito - stratonovich dilemma ''  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the ambiguities in the langevin discretization scheme raise concerns on the asymptotic phase - space distribution of the relativistic brownian particles under consideration .",
    "the latter has been an issue of debate ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) but should be constrained by the long - time limit of equilibrium  @xcite , i.e. , by a `` detailed - balancing '' of the drag and diffusion terms of the underlying fokker - planck equation .",
    "the large collective flow of the medium created in urhics ( reaching collective velocities in excess of half the speed of light ) , and in particular subtle angular modulations thereof ( such as the elliptic flow ) , make a good understanding of differences in the realization of _ relativistic _ langevin simulations mandatory .",
    "in particular , the description of the phase - space distribution of a brownian particle ( the heavy quark ) , which is usually formulated in laboratory - frame coordinates , needs to manifestly recover the equilibrium limit given by the lorentz - invariant boltzmann - jttner distribution  @xcite .",
    "this is evident as the underlying fokker - planck equation is to yield a good approximation of the lorentz - covariant boltzmann equation  @xcite .",
    "this problem has been addressed , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite within the so - called ito realization , while pertinent fokker - planck equations following from different langevin prescriptions have been given in ref .",
    "more recently , a lorentz - covariant implementation of the langevin process has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite based on a relativistic fluctuation - dissipation theorem .    in the present work we pursue a slightly different approach .",
    "we start from a fokker - planck equation with transport coefficients obtained from an underlying microscopic theory , in the sense of an approximate treatment of the collision integral in the transport equation . after recovering the generalized relativistic einstein relation for these coefficients ,",
    "we discuss their implementation into different langevin realizations and verify their uniqueness in explicit examples , in particular including the case of expanding media .",
    "we also show how variations in the langevin coefficients induce modifications to the long - time limit ( equilibrium ) distribution of the brownian particle . for definiteness ,",
    "our numerical applications will be illustrated in the context of hq diffusion in an expanding qgp as formed in urhics .",
    "our article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_fp ] we introduce the fokker - planck equation as an approximate description of the boltzmann equation , and recall the general equilibrium condition constraining its drag and diffusion coefficients . in sec .",
    "[ sec_langevin ] we elaborate how langevin prescriptions emerge from the pertinent equilibrium conditions to ensure a uniform outcome of the fokker - planck framework , i.e. , how fokker - planck equations resulting from different langevin prescriptions take the same form in terms of universal drag and diffusion coefficients of an underlying microscopic theory . in sec .",
    "[ sec_num ] langevin prescriptions are illustrated with numerical calculations for different model systems for flowing media .",
    "we demonstrate that both pre- and post - point langevin schemes lead to the lorentz - invariant boltzmann - jttner distribution for test particles in the presence of collective flow as the long - time limit of the langevin process , if and only if the proper equilibrium condition is imposed .",
    "some variants of the realization of the stochastic langevin process and their consequences on the long - time limit are also discussed in this section .",

    "in addition , in statistical equilibrium , the particle flux has to vanish  @xcite : @xmath21 .",
    "together with the boltzmann - jttner distribution ( [ bj ] ) this yields a dissipation - fluctuation relation between drag and diffusion coefficient , @xmath22 this is the manifestation of the detailed - balance property of the collision - transition probabilities , which is due to the unitarity of the @xmath23-matrix of quantum - field theory and thus embodied in the collision integral of the underlying full boltzmann equation  @xcite .",

    "the phase - space distribution determined by the langevin equations ( [ lrule1 ] ) and ( [ lrule2 ] ) satisfies a fokker - planck equation , which can be found by calculating the average change of an arbitrary phase - space function with time  @xcite .",

    "second , the fokker - planck equation and the langevin equation are specified for a spatially homogeneous static medium ; neither of them is manifestly lorentz covariant .",

    "<S> we study the consequences of different realizations of diffusion processes in relativistic langevin simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we elaborate on the ito - stratonovich dilemma by showing how microscopically calculated transport coefficients as obtained from a boltzmann / fokker - planck equation can be implemented to lead to an unambiguous realization of the langevin process . </S>",
    "<S> pertinent examples within the pre - point ( ito ) and post - point ( hnggi - klimontovich ) langevin prescriptions are worked out explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> deviations from this implementation are shown to generate variants of the boltzmann distribution as the stationary ( equilibrium ) solutions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we explicitly verify how the lorentz invariance of the langevin process is maintained in the presence of an expanding medium , including the case of an `` elliptic flow '' transmitted to a brownian test particle . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly relevant for using heavy - flavor diffusion as a quantitative tool to diagnose transport properties of qcd matter as created in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions . </S>"
