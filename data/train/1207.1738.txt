    "in particular , fig .  [ fig:8](b ) demonstrates that the approximation remains accurate in the presence of the interactions too . on the other hand , figs .",
    "[ fig:8](c ) and ( d ) show that an increase in the number of atoms does not affect the agreement between the 1d and 3d simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig:9](a ) shows profiles of the 1d density , @xmath138 , for five different values of spin @xmath2 , in the presence of the confining harmonic - oscillator potential acting in the axial direction ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the smallest width of the profile is observed at largest @xmath2 , which is a result of the relatively weak pauli repulsion versus the attractive interactions , as a consequence of the lower spin degeneracy .",
    "figure  [ fig:9](b ) shows axial expansion of the trapped fermi gas with the increase of the strength of the transverse confinement ( @xmath144 ) . this trend is a consequence of the rapid enhancement of the pauli repulsion .",
    "typical 1d - density patterns for the gas trapped in the ol are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:10](a ) .",
    "note that the increase of the confinement strength leads to attenuation of the central peak and generation of new side peaks , which is consistent with the elongation of the gas observed in fig .",
    "fig:9(b ) .",
    "the lowering of the central peak is accompanied by the increase of the density between peaks , resulting in the reduction of their visibility .",
    "a similar behavior is observed in fig .",
    "[ fig:10](b ) , where the repulsive inter - atomic interaction makes the trapped state elongated along @xmath43 , resembling the elongation induced by the strengthening transverse confinement , and vice versa for the attractive interaction .",
    "figure  fig:11 shows the strong dependence of the 1d density profile @xmath138 on the ol s ( double ) period @xmath153 , for a fixed strength of the confinement potential .",
    "it is clear that the number of peaks in the 1d pattern is larger for smaller @xmath153 .",
    "the increase of @xmath153 entails disappearance of peripheral peaks at particular values of @xmath153 .",
    "the present 1d description makes it possible to identify these critical values .    to further analyze the ground state of the fermi gas in presence of the ol , we define the width of the trapped state , @xmath154 , as the size of the area with density @xmath155 .",
    "figure  [ fig:12 ] presents diagrams for characteristics of the ground state in the plane of the transverse and axial trapping frequencies , @xmath156 .",
    "the jumps observed in fig .  [ fig:12](a ) correspond to the emergence or disappearance of pairs of density peaks . since the wavelength is @xmath157 , the emergence or disappearance of the peak pair gives rise , respectively , to the increase or decrease of the width by @xmath158 .",
    "thus , the observed minimum width ( @xmath159 ) corresponds to the profile with five peaks , and the maximum width ( @xmath160 ) is represented by the profile with twenty three peaks .",
    "note that , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] , the density between peaks may be very small .",
    "further , we define that two peaks as being  connected \" if the minimum density between them is greater than @xmath161 .",
    "accordingly , fig .",
    "[ fig:12](b ) shows the number of peaks  disconnected \" from the central core .",
    "this characteristic is found by subtracting the number of the connecting links between the peaks , defined as said above , from the total number of the observed peaks ( excluding the central one ) .",
    "the diagram features four regions covered by similar colors , which correspond to four possible values of the number of isolated peaks , @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "these regions alternate with the variation of both @xmath144 and @xmath101 , demonstrating that the number of the isolated peaks may be maintained while varying the total number of the observed peaks .",
    "we have demonstrated that the 1d and 2d reductions of the 3d mean - field description of the degenerate fermi gas , based on the gaussian variational ansatz , provide very accurate results for the ground states of the gas in the disk- and cigar - shaped traps . the so derived reduced equations are useful , in particular , for modeling the bcs regime at low atomic density and large spatiotemporal variations of the external potential . for the 1d case ,",
    "the reduced equations provide results requiring the use of modest computational resources and allow one to quickly explore a vast volume of the parameter space . in the 2d case , the necessary simulation time is still significantly lower than what is necessary for the 3d simulations . for the spatially uniform ground states in both dimensions , we have studied the width of the fermi gas in the confinement dimensions , and the energy density as a function of the atomic density . in the 2d case",
    ", we have found that the energy density attains a maximum at a particular value of the atomic density , and the maximum shifts to lower values as the attractive interactions get stronger .",
    "while the analysis is approximate due to limitations of the model , it shows the correct dependence on the scattering length , confinement strength , and the phase - space degeneracy ( i.e. , the fermionic spin , @xmath2 ) .    for the gas trapped in the 2d ol ,",
    "the analysis predicts the number of visible peaks in the density profile as a function of the scattering length and confinement strength .",
    "it was concluded that small variations of the latter parameter produce significant changes in the size and distribution of the peaks . in the 1d setting including the axial ol , we have produced the phase diagrams for the fermi gas , varying the confinement parameters .",
    "discrete leaps in the diagrams correspond to the appearance and disappearance of a pair of peripheral peaks in the density profile .",
    "in fact , the number of peaks does not change in a wide range of the confinement parameters .    in general ,",
    "our model is able to include any type of the confinement and potential lattices in the 1d and 2d settings , making the description of the ground state quite simple . in particular , we considered the example of the hexagonal superlattice built as a superposition of two triangular lattices .",
    "the latter setting may be essential for modeling configurations relevant to solid - state physics .",
    "the same approach may be further applied to superlattices built of hexagonal ols , with the objective to emulate graphene - like superlattice . beyond the study of the ground states , it may be interesting to build quasi-2d modes with embedded vorticity , cf . ref . @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the reduced equations can be used to study the dynamics of the fermi gas under the action of external potentials slowly varying in time , similar to how it was done in bec models .",
    "finally , the same type of the description , including , if necessary , equations for the bose gas , may be used to predict the ground state and analyze the low - energy dynamics of fermi - fermi and bose - fermi mixtures .",
