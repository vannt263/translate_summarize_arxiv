    "recall that the boundary conditions @xmath46 correspond to omitting vertical transmission ( see @xcite ) .    in the absence of the disease ,",
    "the evolution of the population density follows the following simple ( chronological ) age - structured equation : @xmath47 where @xmath10 denotes the natural death rate while @xmath9 corresponds to the birth rate , that is assumed to be a constant influx .    with 350 million people",
    "chronically infected , the hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) pandemic is a global public health problem and constitutes one of the main cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma with a high rate of morbidity and mortality especially in south - east asia and sub - saharan africa struggling with a prevalence of hbsag ( hepatitis b surface antigens ) chronic carriers greater than 8@xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the class of hbv chronic carriers has a high risk of developing liver disease such as the one mentioned above .    in highly endemic areas the epidemiology of hbv exhibits two main features : a low average age at infection and a high prevalence of chronic carriers .",
    "according to numerous works ( see for instance @xcite and the references therein ) there is a rapid decline in the probability of developing the chronic carrier stage of the disease with respect to the age at infection . according edmunds et al @xcite , approximatively 90@xmath48 of children of less than 5 years old will become carriers if infected while about 10@xmath48 of adults will become carriers if infected .",
    "moreover this age - specific probability appears to be remarkably stable for a wide range of areas @xcite .",
    "hence the mathematical modelling of hbv infection requires to take into account this strong age - specific differential susceptibility of humans .    in such highly endemic areas ,",
    "these are two main routes for the infection of children : a vertical transmission from an infected mother to her infant , and an horizontal transmission through close contacts .    following who @xcite ,",
    "perinatal transmission is a much less important contributor to the carrier pool in africa ( we also refer to assumption 4.1 in @xcite for similar consideration for the chinese case or @xcite for the pakistanese case ) .",
    "moreover anfumbom et al.@xcite state that `` a low proportion of hbeag among hbsag - positive pregnant women with known hiv status could suggest low perinatal transmission of hbv for an endemic country like in cameroon '' ( see also @xcite ) . hence , as in the work of edmunds et al.@xcite , we shall focus , in this work , on horizontal transmission taking into account age - specific susceptibility .",
    "this differential susceptibility is a particularly important point for hbv infection .",
    "let us recall that according to cdc ( see also @xcite and the references therein ) about 90@xmath48 of children will remain chronically infected with hbv while 90@xmath48 of adults will develop acute infection and will completely recover from hbv infection . +",
    "hence the main feature of the above described models consists in the age - specific susceptibility dependence through function @xmath49 @xcite ( or @xmath50 ) .",
    "edmunds et al . in @xcite",
    "justifies the fact that `` the expected probability '' @xmath19 ( of developing the chronic carrier state given the age @xmath2 at infection in an exponential function of age @xmath2 ) is decreasing .",
    "more specifically according edmunds et al .",
    "in @xcite function @xmath51 takes the form @xmath52 for some suitable parameter set . in order to take into account",
    "this age - specific susceptibility dependence we will use in this work a simplest prototypical shape curve of the form @xmath53 for some @xmath54 $ ] and @xmath55 . note that this specific form will only be used to check some assumptions in order to apply our main perturbation result . based on the data of @xcite we estimate the above parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 using the least squares method to obtain the following function ( graphically closed to edmunds s ( * ? ? ?",

    "the dynamics for the chronic carriers is fully known from the dynamics of the reduced system because the @xmath82variables decouple from the @xmath83variable .    in order to understand the dynamics of the above problem - with @xmath84 , we will make use of the abstract results of magal in @xcite to derive a result about global asymptotic stability of the endemic equilibrium for small values of @xmath70 .",
