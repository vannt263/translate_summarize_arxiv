    "consider a text of @xmath6 words of an author with a vocabulary of @xmath20 words . here",
    "the words in the vocabulary correspond to the cells of the multinomial distribution and the existence of a limiting or approximating parent density is rather unrealistic . to a lesser extent",
    "this might be the case in biology , where cells correspond to species and @xmath6 is the number of individuals found in some ecological entity .",
    "an estimator that is consistent even if our key assumption does not hold , has been constructed in klaassen and mnatsakanov ( 2000 ) .",
    "however , it seems to have a logarithmic rate of convergence only .",
    "the rates of convergence of our grouping and kernel estimators will depend on the rate at which the assumed limiting parent density can be estimated .",

    "since the estimators studied here are based on smoothing of the cell frequencies an important open problem is the choice of the smoothing parameter . for the estimator based on grouping",
