    "the celebrated _ diffusion - limited aggregation _",
    "( in short , * dla * ) model is a probabilistic model where particles undergoing a certain diffusion stick together and form up into clusters .",
    "most commonly , the aggregate begins with a single particle at a fixed point , and in every iteration a new particle arrives via a brownian motion ( or some random walk ) starting from infinity and stops at the moment it hits the existing cluster , thus expanding it .",
    "this model was first introduced by witten and sander ( @xcite ) in 1981 , as a model which could be used to represent several physical phenomena related to systems where the principle mean of transport of particles is by diffusion .",
    "some examples of systems which appear to have dla - like behaviour are electro - deposition , mineral deposits , and dielectric breakdown systems .",
    "the most interesting settings for the dla model are naturally the two and three dimensional euclidean spaces ( or the grids @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) . in these spaces , determining some of the most basic properties of this model seem to be notoriously hard problems .",
    "for example , it is not known whether the rate of growth of the diameter of the aggregate is not @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number of particles and @xmath4 is the dimension , or whether or not the density of the cluster at time infinity is zero .",
    "it is conjectured by physicists that the answers to both these questions are positive .",
    "one of the only known facts about dla in euclidean space is the result of kesten , @xcite , who obtained the upper bound @xmath5 for the speed of growth of the diameter of the dla in @xmath6 .",
    "we would also like to mention a paper of barlow , pemantle and perkins ( @xcite ) in which the dla model on a tree is studied .",
    "roughly speaking , an analogous version of this model can be defined in any space where the notion of diffusion exists .",
    "if the poisson boundary consists of one point ( or , in other words , the definition of `` a particle released at infinity '' makes sense ) and the diffusion is recurrent , the growth process can be defined so that law of the location of a new particle is the harmonic measure of the existing aggregate with pole at infinity .",
    "if the diffusion is transient ( such as in the case of @xmath1 ) one can consider the harmonic measure with a pole far away from the aggregate , let the pole go to infinity and take limits ( i.e. , conditioning on a random walk coming from infinity to hit the cluster ) .",
    "another way to define the law of growth in settings where the diffusion is transient is to use the _ time - reversibility _ property of the random walk . according to this property , the harmonic measure of a set , with pole at infinity , is proportional to the so - called _ equilibrium measure _ associated to the set . for sets with sufficient smoothness properties , this measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the hausdorff measure on the boundary of the set and its density is proportional to the gradient , in the normal direction to the boundary , of the solution of the dirichlet problem with boundary conditions @xmath7 on the set and @xmath8 at infinity . from a probabilistic point of view , this density is roughly proportional to the probability that a particle released close to the boundary of the set reaches infinity before hitting the aggregate .",
    "fortunately , this definition also makes sense in settings where the poisson boundary consists of more than one point . a more detailed description of this will be given in the next section .",
    "our aim in this paper is to study a dla model defined on the _ hyperbolic plane _ , showing that in this case , the cluster at time infinity almost surely admits a positive upper density .",
    "our results suggest that in the hyperbolic setting the behavior of the aggregate is simpler to analyze than the euclidean one .",
    "however , simulations point that its geometry is still fairly complicated : it seems that the so - called `` rich - get - richer '' behavior takes place also in this setting and the aggregates look far from having a certain limit shape .",
    "our results may therefore be viewed as a modest attempt to rigorously study certain properties of a model whose complexity is somewhat similar to that of the euclidean dla .",
    "diffusion - limited growth on general riemannian manifolds and specifically on the hyperbolic plane was already considered in the physics literature , see @xcite ; the physical motivation for this study is that natural phenomena of dla - like behavior such as mineral dendrites , cell colonies and cancerous tumors usually grow on curved surfaces .    in our construction ,",
    "the particles will be metric balls of radius @xmath7 .",
    "we define @xmath9 to be a fixed point @xmath10 and recursively @xmath11 where the point @xmath12 ( thought of as the center of a disc - shaped particle ) will be picked from the set of points whose distance from @xmath13 is exactly @xmath14 ( which means exactly that the corresponding discs will be tangent to each other ) and will be distributed in this set proportionally to the probability of escape to infinity , described in the previous paragraph .",
    "we will also write @xmath15",
    ". the precise construction appears in the next section .    _ , width=340",
    "]    in a metric measure space @xmath16 whose diameter is infinite , we say that a locally - finite set @xmath17 has an _ upper density _ greater or equal to @xmath18 if there exists a point @xmath19 and a sequence @xmath20 such that @xmath21 as @xmath22 , such that @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a metric ball centered at @xmath25 with radius @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the measure defined on @xmath16 . we can use this definition in the hyperbolic plane , using the standard hyperbolic distance as a metric and the standard riemannian volume of a set as a measure .",
    "+   + our main theorem reads ,    [ mainthm ] the set @xmath28 almost surely has an upper density greater than @xmath18 , where @xmath29 is a universal constant .",
    "the reader may suspect that the above theorem follows from a general geometric fact about the hyperbolic plane and does not use any of the randomness in the model .",
    "alas , there is an example of a connected set which is a union of balls of radius 1 , whose convex hull is the entire plane , but whose upper density is zero . indeed , consider the following `` spiral '' set : take a point @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 is the tangent space at @xmath25 ) and consider the exponential map @xmath33 .",
    "define @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a unit vector in @xmath32 whose angle with @xmath36 is @xmath37 , @xmath38 is a geodesic ball of radius @xmath26 centered at @xmath25 and @xmath39 is an increasing function .",
    "it is not hard to verify that if the function @xmath39 goes to infinity fast enough , the set @xmath40 will have the properties described above .",
    "@xmath41 in the vaguest sense , the intuition behind the fact that the behavior of the dla model in the hyperbolic plane is different from the conjectured behavior in euclidean space is related to the rate of decay of the harmonic potential .",
    "consider two particles located at distance @xmath42 apart .",
    "the probability for two brownian paths released from the two particles to intersect at some point is exponentially decreasing with @xmath42 which , in turn , roughly means that when growing an aggregate from those two points simultaneously , these two aggregates will hardly interact .",
    "in particular , the new particles added to any two given `` arms '' of our aggregate will grow farther away from each other at linear speed .",
    "this means that the growth law of the aggregate is almost `` local '' in the sense that the subtree related to each new particle added to the aggregate will only ever be affected by its immediate neighborhood and , moreover , their interaction will decrease exponentially with time .",
    "the absence of long - range interactions will prevent the multi - scale phenomena , expected in the euclidean case , from occurring in our case .",
    "specifically , the geometry of the hyperbolic plane makes it much harder to isolate certain parts of the dla and disallowing them to grow further by creating _ fjords _ which are too narrow for particles to come through , which in turn means that the dla will locally keep growing at most of its parts and will eventually fill the whole space .",
    "let us now review the general plan of our proof , while trying to explain how the aforementioned properties of hyperbolic geometry come into play",
    ".    the main step of the proof will be to show that there exists a universal constant @xmath43 such that for any metric ball @xmath44 of radius @xmath45 , there is a probability of at least @xmath46 that the aggregate will intersect this ball , no matter how far the ball is from the starting point of the aggregate .",
    "the proof of this step relies heavily on the fact that the upper half - plane , @xmath47 , is isometric to @xmath48 via a conformal mapping ( using the so - called poincar metric ) . regarding our aggregate on the upper half plane and choosing the correct embedding ,",
    "this is easily reduced to showing that an aggregate which begins at the point @xmath49 reaches , with a non - negligible probability , any rectangle of the form @xmath50 \\times [ 1,2]$ ] where @xmath51 is a universal constant and @xmath52 is an arbitrarily small positive number .",
    "at this point , let us now try to further illustrate the difference between euclidean and hyperbolic geometry which we are going to exploit : in order for the aggregate to never reach the rectangle @xmath53 , it has to encompass @xmath53 , at least in the sense that @xmath53 will be contained in the convex hull of the aggregate before any point of the @xmath53 has a chance to be reached by it .",
    "in particular , the aggregate has to reach one of the lines @xmath54 .",
    "now , note that any geodesic line connecting the starting points with these two lines actually passes through @xmath53 .",
    "in other words , the rectangle @xmath53 acts as bottleneck which prevents the aggregate from encompassing it .",
    "it is easy to see that no analogous phenomenon takes place in the euclidean space .    as mentioned above , in the paper of barlow , pemantle and perkins ( @xcite ) , a diffusion - limited aggregation on an infinite regular tree",
    "is studied .",
    "the fact that the hyperbolic space has a tree - like structure may mislead the reader to think that the model studied in their paper is closely related to our model , and that the two are therefore expected to behave in the same way . while these two models are superficially similar and both called dla , their behavior is nevertheless quite different .",
    "remark that on the discrete tree , each connected component of the complement of a given subtree looks exactly the same .",
    "thus , the tree counterpart of our process would be defined such that the rate of growth of the aggregate is constant on all points of its boundary , regardless of its geometry . by definition",
    ", this aggregate will eventually fill the entire tree and it is not hard to see that it would do it in a rather uniform way .",
    "let us try to explain our strategy to formally establish the fact that @xmath53 is likely to be reached by the aggregate before one of the lines @xmath54 is reached",
    ".    the idea will be to establish bounds on the rate of growth of the minimum encompassing rectangle of the aggregate , hence the maximal @xmath12-coordinate of the aggregate at time @xmath55 , denoted by @xmath56 , and the maximal @xmath57-coordinate , denoted by @xmath58 ( see figure [ figdef ] below ) . in order to prove that the aggregate reaches the rectangle @xmath53 , it will be enough to show that @xmath56 does not grow much faster than @xmath58 .",
    "we will work with a continuous time @xmath59 , so that growth of the cluster is according to an exponential clock whose rate is proportional to the capacity , which ensures us that in small time intervals the expected rate of growth in different parts of the cluster is roughly independent ( this is defined in section 2 ) .",
    "two key geometric lemmas proven in section 3 will provide an upper bound for the rate of growth of @xmath56 and a lower bound for the rate of growth of @xmath58 .",
    "the former bound , whose proof uses the easy fact that in the half - plane model the @xmath57 coordinate of the center of metric circle of radius @xmath7 is proportional to its euclidean radius , roughly says that @xmath60 < c y(t)$ ] . according to the latter bound , which makes use of the conformal invariance , the probability of @xmath58 to multiply itself by a constant during a unit time interval is at least of the order @xmath61 , or in other words , roughly @xmath62 . here",
    "@xmath63 are universal constants .",
    "next , we note that ( very informally ) these bounds combined give @xmath64 one would expect that by integrating those two bounds it should be possible to attain an estimate of the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a positive constant which depends on the ratio @xmath67 , at least in expectation",
    ". however , it seems like the above bounds can not be pushed to give constants which would yield @xmath68 .    because of this , we have to do something a little more complicated .",
    "we define @xmath69 as the height of the cluster close to the edge where @xmath12 attains its maximum ( as in figure [ figdef ] below ) , and consider two difference cases : if @xmath69 is much smaller than @xmath58 , we get that @xmath70 is small enough so that the two bounds above can be integrated to attain that @xmath71 is negative . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath69 and @xmath58 are comparable , it turns out that we expect @xmath72 to decrease due to a completely different reason ( provided that it is not too small ) .",
    "we know that there is a non - negligible probability that the height of the cluster will grow rather rapidly close to its edge ( hence close to the place where @xmath56 is attained ) , and therefore @xmath58 can multiply itself by a constant within a constant amount of time .",
    "all of this is carried out in section 4 .",
    "once we have those two bounds , which can be combined into a unified bound on the ( expected ) rate of growth of @xmath73 the proof of the main step is just a matter of defining the correct martingale and using the optional stopping theorem .",
    "note , however , that the process @xmath72 can not actually be a super - martingale as we know that it is always positive , and it clearly does not converge . ideologically , this process should be regarded as a super - martingale reflecting at zero , and for such processes , the optional stopping theorem can not help ( it is not hard to see that brownian motion with a strong drift towards zero and reflection at zero can be almost surely stopped at arbitrarily large values with a stopping time of finite expectation ) . with a little extra work , we show that the process @xmath74 is also a super - martingale with reflection at zero and a strong enough drift , which turns out to be enough . in section 5 , we tie up the loose ends , showing how the main step can be used complete the proof .",

    "in this section we finally prove theorem [ mainthm ] . we begin with a lemma which",
    "roughly claims that the probability of the aggregate to intersect a any metric ball whose radius is large enough , is close to @xmath7 , no matter how far the ball is from the origin of the aggregate .",
    "the proof is a consequence of the tools developed in the previous section ; we show that by choosing a suitable embedding of the aggregate into the poincar half - plane , the question of intersecting a specific metric ball boils down to the fact that @xmath58 grows rapidly enough compared to @xmath56 .",
    "[ lemmain ] there exists a universal constant @xmath540 such that the following holds : given any time @xmath159 and any finite starting aggregate , @xmath157 , which started from a point @xmath30 , there exists a number @xmath541 such that for any point @xmath542 with @xmath543 one has , @xmath544    denote by @xmath545 the @xmath84-diameter of @xmath157 , and define @xmath546 for any two points @xmath75 , there is a ( unique up to orientation ) isometric embedding @xmath547 such that @xmath548 and @xmath549 for some @xmath550 .",
    "so given the starting point of the aggregate , @xmath25 , and an arbitrary point @xmath542 satisfying @xmath543 ( where @xmath42 is a constant whose value will be determined later on ) , we may therefore assume without loss of generality that @xmath551 and that @xmath552 . consider the metric ball , @xmath553 clearly , if @xmath45 is a large enough universal constant , this ball will contain a rectangle of the form @xmath554 \\times [ s , 2 s ] \\subset \\ph.\\ ] ] where @xmath555 is a universal constant whose value will be chosen later on ( see figure [ figlem ] for an illustration ) . also consider the stopping times , @xmath556 by the definition of @xmath557 we have @xmath558 , and thus by theorem [ mainsec4 ] we know that for all @xmath528 , @xmath559 < c + 0.9 \\ee[r(\\tau_i ) | a(t)].\\ ] ] for a universal constant @xmath51 , which implies that @xmath560 \\geq c_1 \\rightarrow \\ee[r(\\tau_{i+1 } ) | a(t ) ] \\leq 0.95 \\ee[r(\\tau_i ) | a(t)]\\ ] ] for @xmath561 .",
    "next , if @xmath562 , then necessarily by lemma [ ballslem ] it means that @xmath563 for a universal constant @xmath29 ( since almost surely only one particle is added at a time , and the increment in @xmath564 is not larger than a constant times @xmath500 ) .",
    "we deduce that @xmath565 = \\ee[r(\\tau_0 ) \\mathbf{1}_{r(\\tau_0 ) < 2 m } | a(t ) ] + \\ee[r(\\tau_0 ) \\mathbf{1}_{r(\\tau_0 ) \\geq 2 m } | a(t ) ] \\leq\\ ] ] @xmath566 for a universal constant @xmath567 .",

    "now , since the number @xmath557 does not depend on the point @xmath542 ( but only on the aggregate @xmath157 ) , by taking @xmath42 to be large enough , it is legitimate to assume that @xmath573 with this assumption , we get @xmath574 \\leq c_1,\\ ] ] and also by the definition @xmath575 , @xmath576 these two equations combined yield @xmath577",

    "the previous equation becomes @xmath579 on the other hand , another application of lemma [ ballslem ] with the fact that only one particle is added at a time almost surely , teaches us that @xmath580 for a universal constant @xmath581 , and by choosing that @xmath555 to be large enough we can assert that @xmath582 almost surely , without affecting the correctness of the above . using the last equation and the definition of @xmath53 , it is easy to check that we have the implication , @xmath583 in light of equation ( [ tauksmall ] ) , this finishes the proof .",
    "we are finally ready to prove the main theorem .",
    "+ _ proof of theorem [ mainthm ] _ + the main idea of the proof is to use the previous lemma iteratively , in order to prove that there exists a random sequence of radii @xmath584 such that @xmath585 almost surely and a random sequence of stopping times @xmath586 such that for all @xmath528 , almost surely @xmath587 where @xmath29 is a universal constant and @xmath10 is the starting point of the aggregate .",
    "this will clearly finish the proof , since it implies that with probability one there exists a sub - sequence of radii @xmath588 such that @xmath589 for a universal constant @xmath29 . + we build these sequences inductively .",
    "we begin with @xmath590 and @xmath591 .",
