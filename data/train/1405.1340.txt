    "in this article we investigate the existence of wandering fatou components for polynomial maps in two complex variables . a natural place to investigate",
    "the existence problem is the class of polynomial skew - products , as these maps lie on the boundary between one and two - dimensional dynamics .",
    "a skew - product is a map of the form @xmath0 if @xmath1 then the fiber @xmath2 is mapped to itself by the function @xmath3 . hence if @xmath4 is a polynomial , then there are no @xmath5-dimensional wandering fatou components in this fiber .    consider the case where @xmath6 , so that all nearby fibers are attracted to the @xmath7-fiber . in this case each one - dimensional fatou components of @xmath3 in the @xmath7-fiber is contained in a @xmath8-dimensional fatou component of @xmath9 .",
    "one naturally wonders if all nearby fatou components are eventually mapped onto one of these fattened ( pre-)periodic fatou components .",
    "indeed , it was shown in the phd thesis of lilov @xcite that this is the case , under the stronger assumption that the @xmath7-fiber is super - attracting , i.e. that @xmath10 . here",
    "we investigate whether his results also hold in the geometrically attracting case , i.e. when @xmath11 .",
    "lilov actually proved a much stronger result which implies the non - existence of wandering fatou components .",
    "we denote by @xmath12 the immediate basin of the superattracting fixed point @xmath7 .",
    "[ thm : lilov ] let @xmath13 , and let @xmath14 be an open one - dimensional disk lying in the @xmath15-fiber . then the forward orbit of @xmath14 must intersect one of the fattened fatou components of @xmath3 .",
    "an immediate corollary is that there are no wandering fatou components in the set @xmath16 .    in this paper",
    "we prove that theorem [ thm : lilov ] does not hold in the geometrically attracting case .",
    "more precisely , we study explicit maps of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are polynomials .",
    "[ thm : main ] there exist a triple @xmath21 and a vertical holomorphic disk @xmath22 whose forward orbit accumulates at a point @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a repelling fixed point in the julia set of @xmath19 .",
    "in particular it follows that the forward orbits of @xmath14 will never intersect the fattened fatou components of @xmath19 .    the disks @xmath14 will be fatou disks , i.e. the family @xmath25 is normal .",
    "however , we will also show in theorem [ thm : julia ] that the disks @xmath14 are completely contained in the julia set of the map @xmath9 .",
    "we note that were this note the case , then the existence of a wandering fatou component would follow immediately from our construction .    in the next section we provide background on polynomial skew - products with a super - attracting fiber . in section ( 3 )",

    "we show that , for a smaller class of maps , we can obtain much faster convergence of the koenigs - map . in section ( 5 )",
    "we use the convergence estimates to construct , again under additional assumptions , the vertical fatou disks mentioned in theorem [ thm : main ] . although the maps for which we prove theorem [ thm : main ] have to satisfy several serious assumptions , we give several explicit examples of such maps . in section ( 6 ) we show that , again under additional assumptions , the constructed vertical fatou disks lie entirely in the julia set , and",

    "the fatou components are well understood .",
    "it was proved in by sulivan @xcite that every fatou component is ( pre- ) periodic , and the periodic fatou components were classified earlier in the works of fatou , siegel and herman .    in two complex dimensions much less is known about fatou components .",
    "there has been considerable progress with respect to the classification of periodic fatou components , see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , the existence question for wandering fatou components remains almost untouched .",
    "only for a few specific cases , the non - existence of wandering fatou components is known , for example for polynomial automorphism that act hyperbolically on their julia sets , see @xcite , and for polynomial skew - products near a super - attracting invariant fiber .",
    "a skew - product is a map @xmath31 of the form @xmath32 the holomorphic dynamics of polynomial skew - products was first studied by heinemann in @xcite and by jonsson in @xcite .",
    "the topology of fatou components of skew products has been studied by roeder in @xcite .    since skew - products map vertical lines to vertical lines , often one - dimensional tools can be used to construct maps with specific dynamical behavior .",
    "for example in @xcite , dujardin used skew - products to construct a non - laminar green current , and in @xcite , boc - thaler , fornss and the first author constructed a fatou component with a punctured limit set . in both articles",
    "polynomial skew - products were used to construct holomorphic endomorphisms of @xmath33 with dynamical phenomena that were previously not known to occur . hence in order to study the existence of wandering fatou components for rational maps in two complex dimensions , it is worthwhile to first investigate whether wandering fatou components can occur for polynomial skew - products .    in his phd thesis lilov studied the dynamical behavior of polynomial skew - products near an invariant vertical fiber . since his results were not published elsewhere we will discuss lilov s results in a little more detail .",
    "let us assume that @xmath34 , and that @xmath35 , so that the orbits of all nearby fibers converge to the invariant fiber @xmath36",
    ".    let us further assume that @xmath37 is a polynomial in @xmath38 , so that @xmath39 in this case the dynamics in the invariant fiber given by the polynomial @xmath40 is very well understood .",
    "each fatou component @xmath41 of @xmath19 is ( pre-)periodic , and every periodic fatou component is either an attracting basin , a parabolic basin or a siegel disk . for each of these cases , and hence for any fatou component of @xmath19 , the following holds .    given a fatou component @xmath41 of @xmath19 , there exists a fatou component @xmath42 of @xmath9 for which @xmath43 .",
    "following lilov we will refer to the fatou components of @xmath9 that contain a fatou component of @xmath19 as a _ fattened _ fatou component .",
    "recall that the one - dimensional fatou component @xmath41 must at some point be mapped onto either an attracting basin , a parabolic basin , or a siegel disk . in his thesis lilov studies",
    "the geometry of the fattened fatou components in each of these three cases under the assumption that the horizontal dynamics is super - attracting , i.e. when @xmath44 .",
    "another important ingredient in the proof of theorem [ thm : lilov ] of lilov is the following .",
    "[ shrinkage ] there exist constants @xmath45 , @xmath46 such that if @xmath47 and @xmath48 is an arbitrary vertical disk of radius @xmath49 , then @xmath50 contains a disk @xmath51 of radius @xmath52 .",
    "applying this lemma repeatedly for the orbit of a vertical disk gives estimates from below for the radii of the images . on the other hand , by studying the geometry of the fattened fatou components lilov also obtains an upper bound on the largest possible vertical disk that can lie in the complement of the fattened fatou components , depending on the distance to the invariant vertical fiber .",
    "a combination of these two estimates then leads to the conclusion that the orbit of any vertical disk must intersect one of the fattened fatou components .",
    "since the fattened fatou components are ( pre- ) periodic , it follows that , in a neighborhood of the invariant fiber , all fatou components of @xmath9 are pre - periodic .",
    "the question we study here is whether the argument used by lilov can also be applied for the geometrically attracting case @xmath53 .",
    "we note that the estimate in lemma [ shrinkage ] is very rough .",
    "indeed , this estimate is relevant only when @xmath19 has a single critical point of order @xmath54 , and the @xmath55-coordinate of the vertical disk @xmath56 lies in a small neighborhood of this critical point . if this is not the case then much better estimates can be obtained .",
    "if the orbit of a vertical disk does not intersect the fattened fatou components then this orbit must converge to the julia set of @xmath19 .",
    "if a critical point of @xmath19 lies in the fatou set then the orbit of @xmath57 will eventually stay away from that critical point , and the estimates are much improved . on the other hand ,",
    "if a critical point lies in the julia set , then it can not be periodic , and the images @xmath58 , which must shrink , will usually be bounded away from that critical point . hence if the orbit of a vertical disk does not intersect one of the fattened fatou components then the radii of the images will shrink much more slowly than lemma [ shrinkage ] suggests .",
    "the above discussion leads to the main idea of this paper . in order to obtain a vertical disk whose orbit does not intersect the fattened fatou component",
    ", one must construct a skew product @xmath9 and a vertical disk @xmath14 whose orbit frequently returns very closely to the critical set .",
    "we show that this can indeed be achieved for a large class of maps .",
