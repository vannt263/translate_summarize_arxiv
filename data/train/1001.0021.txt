    "single - species bose - hubbard ( bh ) model is the bosonic generalization of the hubbard model , and was introduced originally to describe @xmath1he in porous media or disordered granular superconductors  @xcite . for hypercubic lattices in all dimensions @xmath0 , there are only two phases in this model : an incompressible mott insulator at commensurate ( integer ) fillings and a compressible superfluid phase otherwise",
    ". the superfluid phase is well described by weak - coupling theories , but the insulating phase is a strong - coupling phenomenon that only appears when the system is on a lattice .",
    "transition from the mott insulator to the superfluid phase occurs as the hopping , particle - particle interaction , or the chemical potential is varied  @xcite .",
    "it is the recent observation of this transition in effectively three-  @xcite , one-  @xcite , and two - dimensional  @xcite optical lattices , which has been considered one of the most remarkable achievements in the field of ultracold atomic gases , since it paved the way for studying other strongly correlated phases in similar setups .",
    "such lattices are created by the intersection of laser fields , and they are nondissipative periodic potential energy surfaces for the atoms .",
    "motivated by this success in experimentally simulating the single - species bh model with ultracold atomic bose gases loaded into optical lattices , there has been recently an intense theoretical activity in analyzing bh as well as fermi - hubbard type models  @xcite .",
    "for instance , in addition to the mott insulator and single - species superfluid phases , it has been predicted that the two - species bh model has at least two additional phases : an incompressible super - counter flow and a compressible paired superfluid phase  @xcite .",
    "our main interest here is in the latter phase , where a direct transition from the mott insulator to the paired superfluid phase ( superfluidity of composite bosons , i.e. bose - bose pairs ) has been predicted , when both species have integer fillings and the interspecies interaction is sufficiently large and attractive . given that the interspecies interactions can be fine tuned in ongoing experiments , e.g. with @xmath2k-@xmath3rb with mixtures  @xcite , via using feshbach resonances , we hope that some of our results could be tested with ultracold atomic systems .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the ground - state phase diagram of the two - species bh model with on - site boson - boson interactions in @xmath0-dimensional hypercubic lattices , including both the repulsive and attractive interspecies interaction , via a strong - coupling perturbation theory in the hopping .",
    "we carry the expansion out to third - order in the hopping , and perform a scaling analysis using the known critical behavior at the tip of the insulating lobes , which allows us to accurately predict the critical point , and the shape of the insulating lobes in the plane of the chemical potential and the hopping .",
    "this technique was previously used to discuss the phase diagram of the single - species bh model  @xcite , extended bh model  @xcite , and of the hardcore bh model with a superlattice  @xcite , and its results showed an excellent agreement with monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",

    ", we propose a chemical - potential extrapolation technique based on scaling theory to extrapolate our third - order power - series expansion into a functional form that is appropriate for the mott lobes , and use it to obtain typical ground - state phase diagrams .",
    "a brief summary of our conclusions is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "to describe bose - bose mixtures loaded into optical lattices , we consider the following two - species bh hamiltonian , @xmath4 where the pseudo - spin @xmath5 labels the trapped hyperfine states of a given species of bosons , or labels different types of bosons in a two - species mixture , @xmath6 is the tunneling ( or hopping ) matrix between sites @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is the boson creation ( annihilation ) and @xmath11 is the boson number operator at site @xmath7 , @xmath12 is the strength of the onsite boson - boson interaction between @xmath13 and @xmath14 components , and @xmath15 is the chemical potential . in this manuscript , we consider a @xmath0-dimensional hypercubic lattice with @xmath16 sites , for which we assume @xmath17 is a real symmetric matrix with elements @xmath18 for @xmath7 and @xmath8 nearest neighbors and @xmath19 otherwise .",
    "the lattice coordination number ( or the number of nearest neighbors ) for such lattices is @xmath20 .",
    "we take the intraspecies interactions to be repulsive ( @xmath21 ) , but discuss both repulsive and attractive interspecies interaction @xmath22 as long as @xmath23 .",
    "this guarantees the stability of the mixture against collapse when @xmath24 , and against phase separation when @xmath25 .",
    "however , when the interspecies interaction is sufficiently large and attractive , we note that instead of a direct transition from the mott insulator to a single particle superfluid phase , it is possible to have a transition from the mott insulator to a paired superfluid phase ( superfluidity of composite bosons , i.e. bose - bose pairs )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one needs to consider both possibilities , as discussed next .",
    "we use the many - body version of rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory in the kinetic energy term to perform the expansion ( in powers of @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) for the different energies needed to carry out our analysis .",
    "the strong - coupling expansion technique was previously used to discuss the phase diagram of the single - species bh model  @xcite , extended bh model  @xcite , and of the hardcore bh model with a superlattice  @xcite , and its results showed an excellent agreement with monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "motivated by the success of this technique with these models , here we apply it to the two - species bh model .    to determine the phase boundary separating the incompressible mott phase from the compressible superfluid phase within the strong - coupling expansion method",
    ", one needs the energy of the mott phase and of its ` defect ' states ( those states which have exactly one extra elementary particle or hole about the ground state ) as a function of @xmath26 and @xmath27 . at the point where the energy of the incompressible state becomes equal to its defect state ,",
    "the system becomes compressible , assuming that the compressibility approaches zero continuously at the phase boundary .",
    "here , we remark that this technique can not be used to calculate the phase boundary between two compressible phases .",
    "the perturbation theory is performed with respect to the ground state of the system when @xmath28 , and therefore we first need zeroth order wave functions of the mott phase and of its defect states . to zeroth order in @xmath26 and @xmath27 ,",
    "the mott insulator wave function can be written as , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is an integer number corresponding to the ground - state occupancy of the pseudo - spin @xmath13 bosons , @xmath31 is the thermal average , and @xmath32 is the vacuum state .",
    "on the other hand , the wave functions of the defect states are determined by degenerate perturbation theory .",
    "the reason for that lies in the fact that when exactly one extra elementary particle or hole is added to the mott phase , it could go to any of the @xmath16 lattice sites , since all of those states share the same energy when @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , the initial degeneracy of the defect states is of order @xmath16 .",
    "when the elementary excitations involve a single-@xmath13-particle ( exactly one extra pseudo - spin @xmath13 boson ) or a single-@xmath13-hole ( exactly one less pseudo - spin @xmath13 boson ) , this degeneracy is lifted at first order in @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the treatment for this case is very similar to the single - species bh model  @xcite , and the wave functions ( to zeroth order in @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) for the single-@xmath13-particle and single-@xmath13-hole defect states turn out to be @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the eigenvector of the hopping matrix @xmath17 with the highest eigenvalue ( which is @xmath35 with @xmath20 ) such that @xmath36 the normalization condition requires that @xmath37 .",
    "notice that we choose the highest eigenvalue of @xmath17 because the hopping matrix enters the hamiltonian as @xmath38 , and we ultimately want the lowest - energy states .",
    "however , when the elementary excitations involve two particles ( exactly one extra boson of each species ) or two holes ( exactly one less boson of each species ) , the degeneracy is lifted at second order in @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "such elementary excitations occur when @xmath22 is sufficiently large and attractive  @xcite , and the wave functions ( to zeroth order in @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) for the two - particle and two - hole defect states can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 turns out to be the eigenvector of the @xmath41 matrix with the highest eigenvalue ( which is @xmath42 with @xmath20 ) such that @xmath43 since the elementary excitations involve two particles or two holes , the degenerate defect states can not be connected by one hopping , but rather require two hoppings to be connected .",
    "therefore , one expects the degeneracy to be lifted at least at second order in @xmath26 and @xmath27 , as discussed next .",
    "next , we employ the many - body version of rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory in @xmath26 and @xmath27 with respect to the ground state of the system when @xmath28 , and calculate the energy of the mott phase and of its defect states . the energy of the mott state is obtained via nondegenerate perturbation theory , and to third order in @xmath26 and @xmath27 it is given by @xmath44 this is an extensive quantity , i.e. @xmath45 is proportional to the number of lattice sites @xmath16 .",

    "in this limit , the two - species bh model reduces to the bose - bose version of the falicov - kimball model  @xcite , the fermi - fermi version of which has been widely discussed in the condensed - matter literature and the fermi - bose version has just been studied  @xcite .",
    "it is known for such models that there is a tendency towards both phase separation and density wave order  @xcite , which requires a new calculation partially similar to that of ref .",
    "one can also examine how the momentum distribution changes with the hopping in the insulating phases  @xcite , which has direct relevance to ultracold atomic experiments .",
    "the author thanks anzi hu , l. mathey and j. k. freericks for discussions , and the scientific and technological research council of turkey ( tb@xmath142tak ) for financial support .",
    "recall that @xmath143 can not be greater than or equal to @xmath144 , otherwise the mixture would be unstable against collapse .",
    "in addition , see e.g. fig .  7 in  @xcite , where tebd calculations show in one dimension that @xmath145 is already sufficient for the mott insulator to paired superfluid transition .",
    "note that , unlike those of single - particle and single - hole excitations where @xmath146 is a constant when @xmath56 , in the case of two - particle and two - hole excitations , @xmath147 must be kept constant when @xmath56 . in this respect , eqs .",
