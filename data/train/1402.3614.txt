    "it is difficult to overstate the impact of the _ kepler _ mission on the observation and analysis of solar - like oscillations in main - sequence and subgiant stars . in a review from just a decade ago",
    ", @xcite highlighted the tentative detections of individual oscillation frequencies in just a few such stars from ground - based observations , and _ kepler _ was not even mentioned . despite funding issues that delayed the mission from an original deployment date in 2006 , _ kepler _ finally launched in march 2009 and operated almost flawlessly for more than 4 years , slightly exceeding its design lifetime @xcite .",
    "the archive of public data now includes nearly uninterrupted observations for many thousands of solar - type stars , including short - cadence data ( 58.85  s sampling , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for hundreds of these targets . in the span of a decade ,",
    "the study of solar - like oscillations has been transformed dramatically @xcite .    during the first 10 months of science operations , _ kepler _ performed a survey for solar - like oscillations in more than 2000 main - sequence and subgiant stars , yielding detections in more than 500 targets from the 1-month data sets .",
    "the initial analysis of this ensemble , using empirical scaling relations @xcite to generate estimates of radius and mass , suggested a significant departure from the mass distribution expected from galactic population synthesis models @xcite .",
    "subsequent analysis of the sample , using updated effective temperatures @xcite and a substantial grid - based modeling effort , led to more precise estimates of the radii and masses as well as information about the stellar ages @xcite .",
    "some of the brightest stars from the survey were subjected to a more detailed analysis , including spectroscopic follow - up to determine more precise atmospheric properties @xcite plus the identification and detailed modeling of dozens of oscillation frequencies in each star @xcite .",
    "these studies gave us a preview of what to expect from the subsequent phase of the mission .",
    "starting with quarter 5 ( q5 ) , _ kepler s _ short - cadence study of solar - like oscillations transitioned to a specific target phase , where extended observations began for a fixed sample of stars identified during the survey .",
    "the target list during this phase gave priority to stars showing oscillations with the highest signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , but it also retained the brightest main - sequence stars cooler than the sun , where the lower intrinsic oscillation amplitudes yielded relatively weak detections from the survey . from q5 through the end of the mission ( q17 ) , about 200 of the 512 available short - cadence targets were typically specified by the _",
    "kepler _ asteroseismic science consortium ( kasc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and about half of those were intended for the study of solar - like oscillations .",
    "just like the exoplanet side of the mission , the kasc team gradually improved the data reduction and analysis methods while additional data swelled the archive .",
    "never in the history of the field had such extended monitoring been possible at all , let alone for such a large sample of stars . as a consequence , the availability of reliable sets of input data for stellar modeling lagged well behind the continually expanding time - series for each star in the archive .",
    "this delay was primarily due to the challenge of coordinating the efforts of multiple teams , first to produce optimized light curves from the raw _ kepler _ data @xcite , then to fit the global oscillation properties and remove the stellar granulation background from the power spectra @xcite , and finally to extract and identify the individual oscillation frequencies using so - called `` peak - bagging '' techniques @xcite . also like the exoplanet program",
    ", ground - based follow up observations were difficult to obtain for the faintest targets , further limiting the number of stars for which detailed modeling was feasible .    even after reliable sets of observational constraints became available , an analogous effort was required to consolidate the results from many stellar modeling teams .",
    "initially this effort sought to define objective metrics of model quality , and to use the ensemble of results from different codes and methods to estimate the systematic uncertainties for a few specific targets @xcite . the first large sample to emerge from the survey made this `` boutique '' modeling approach impractical , and motivated the initial large - scale application of the asteroseismic modeling portal ( amp , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite presented a uniform analysis of 22 _ kepler _ targets observed for 1 month each during the survey phase , and compared detailed modeling from amp with empirical scaling relations and with results from several grid - based modeling methods that matched the global oscillation properties ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 , see below ) rather than the individual frequencies from peak - bagging .",
    "the results clearly demonstrated the improved level of precision that was possible from detailed modeling of the individual oscillation frequencies , particularly for stellar ages .    in this paper",
    "we present stellar modeling results from amp for the first large sample of _ kepler _ targets with extended observations during the specific target phase of the mission . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we describe the sample , which was drawn from the most recently published observations .",
    "we outline our stellar modeling approach in section  [ sec3 ] , including several improvements to the previous version of amp and using slightly customized procedures for different types of stars .",
    "we present the main results and initial applications in section  [ sec4 ] , and we discuss conclusions and future prospects in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "solar - like oscillations are stochastically excited and intrinsically damped by turbulent convection near the stellar surface @xcite . each oscillation mode",
    "is characterized by its radial order @xmath2 and spherical degree @xmath3 , and only the low - degree ( @xmath4 ) modes are generally detectable without spatial resolution across the surface .",
    "the consecutive radial orders define the average large separation @xmath5 , which reflects the mean stellar density @xcite .",
    "the power in each mode is governed by a roughly gaussian envelope with a maximum at frequency @xmath1 , which approximately scales with the acoustic cutoff frequency @xcite .",
    "these global oscillation properties are well - constrained , even in the relatively short time - series obtained during the _ kepler _ survey phase .",
    "longer observations improve the frequency precision and also reveal additional oscillation modes , with lower and higher radial orders , as the s / n improves in the wings of the gaussian envelope .",
    "this is the primary motivation for gathering extended observations : to maximize both the number and quality of asteroseismic constraints that are available for stellar modeling .",
    "@xcite published asteroseismic data sets for 61 main - sequence and subgiant stars observed by _",
    "kepler _ , based on an analysis of 9-month time - series .",
    "the data were collected during q5q7 ( 2010 mar 20 through 2010 dec 22 ) , archived on 2011 apr 23 , and the final sets of identified frequencies were published about one year later .",
    "most of these frequency sets came from maximum likelihood estimators @xcite with errors determined from the inverse of the hessian matrix , but frequencies for the f - like stars were obtained from a bayesian analysis with multinest @xcite and errors were estimated from the 68% credible interval .",
    "when asymmetric errors were provided , we adopted the mean of the two quoted values .",
    "no similar analysis of more extended data sets has yet been published , so we adopted this sample of 61 stars as our uniform source of asteroseismic constraints .",
    "in addition to the asteroseismic data , precise spectroscopic constraints on the effective temperature @xmath6 and metallicity [ m / h ] are also required for detailed stellar modeling . a uniform spectroscopic analysis of 93 solar - type _ kepler _ targets was published by @xcite , including 46 of the brightest stars in the @xcite  sample with magnitudes in the _ kepler _ bandpass @xmath79.8 .",
    "six of the 15 missing targets are also in this magnitude range : kic3735871 , 11772920 , 12317678 and 12508433 , as well as the two bright spectroscopic binaries kic8379927 and 9025370 .",
    "the remaining 9 stars fall in the magnitude range @xmath811.4 , and are difficult targets for high - resolution spectroscopy on all but the largest telescopes .",
    "are shown as dotted lines , with the position of the sun indicated by the @xmath9 symbol .",
    "stars similar to the sun are missing from the kasc sample because the data were sequestered by the _ kepler _ exoplanet team.[fig1 ] ]    recently , @xcite published spectroscopic constraints for a larger sample of 169 stars in the _ kepler _ field .",
    "the overlap with the @xcite sample only includes two additional stars ( kic11772920 and 12508433 ) for the low - precision rotfit results @xcite , while the high - precision ares+moog results @xcite contain fewer asteroseismic targets than are available in the @xcite  sample .",
    "considering that our goal is to produce a uniform analysis , we adopted the spectroscopic constraints from @xcite , limiting the available sample to 46 stars .",
    "four of these targets are evolved subgiants with too many mixed modes for successful automated modeling , so our final sample includes 42 stars .",
    "following @xcite , we adopted larger uncertainties on @xmath6 ( @xmath10  k , see figure  [ fig1 ] ) that fold in a systematic error of 59  k , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "for 12 stars with _ hipparcos _ parallaxes @xcite , we used the spectroscopic @xmath6 to obtain bolometric corrections from @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we adopted @xmath11 and used the extinction estimates from @xcite to derive luminosity constraints .",
    "the asteroseismic modeling portal ( amp , * ? ? ? * ) is a web - based interface to the stellar model - fitting pipeline described in detail by @xcite .",
    "the underlying science code uses a parallel genetic algorithm ( ga , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on xsede supercomputing resources to optimize the match between asteroseismic models produced by the aarhus stellar evolution code ( astec , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and adiabatic pulsation code ( adipls , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a given set of observational constraints . @xcite",
    "were the first to apply amp to a large sample of _ kepler _ targets , motivating several improvements to the physical inputs and fitting procedures that are described below .",
    "the version of amp that was used for the models presented by @xcite was configured to use the @xcite solar mixture with the opal 2005 equation of state ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the most recent opal opacities ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , supplemented by @xcite opacities at low temperatures .",
    "the updated version of amp uses the low - t opacities from @xcite .",
    "we have also updated the default nuclear reaction rates , replacing the @xcite rates with those from the nacre collaboration @xcite .",
    "convection is still described by the mixing - length theory from @xcite without overshoot , and we continue to include the effects of helium diffusion and settling as described by @xcite . to correct the model frequencies for so - called `` surface effects '' due to incomplete modeling of the near - surface layers , we use the empirical prescription of @xcite .",
    "we originally performed our analysis shortly after the publication of asteroseismic constraints by @xcite , using the updated physics described above but without modifying the fitting procedures .",
    "the approach used by @xcite simultaneously optimized the match between the models and two sets of constraints : [ 1 ] the individual oscillation frequencies and [ 2 ] the atmospheric parameters from spectroscopy .",
    "this procedure generally yielded stellar radii , masses and ages that were consistent with empirical scaling relations and grid - based modeling of the global oscillation properties ( @xmath0 and @xmath1)but with significantly improved precision .",
    "however , the optimal models for the 22 targets included six stars with an initial helium mass fraction @xmath12 significantly below the primordial value from standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( @xmath13 , * ? ? ? * ) , and four additional stars that were marginally below @xmath14 .",
    "the original motivation for including these sub - primordial values in the search was a recognition that there could be systematic errors in the determination of @xmath15 , but the source of the potential bias was not identified .",
    "our first attempts to fit the data described in section  [ sec2 ] using the same methods as @xcite were plagued by an even higher fraction of models with low initial helium , so we revised our procedures .      as part of a study of convective cores in two _ kepler _ targets ,",
    "amp was compared to several other fitting methods by @xcite .",
    "in addition to the individual frequencies and spectroscopic constraints , some of these methods also used sets of frequency ratios that eliminated the need to correct the model frequencies for surface effects @xcite . a comparison of the amp results with models that used the frequency ratios as additional constraints revealed systematic differences in the interior structure that were correlated with the initial helium abundance .",
    "we subsequently modified the amp optimization procedure to try to avoid this bias , by adopting the frequency ratios as additional constraints and by reducing the weight at higher frequency , where the surface correction is larger ( see details below ) .",
    "the ratios proposed by @xcite are constructed from individual frequency separations , including the large separations defined by @xmath16 and the small separations defined by @xmath17 these can be used to define one set of ratios that relates the small separation between modes of degree 0 and 2 to the large separation of @xmath18 modes at the same radial order : @xmath19 note that these ratios involve modes with all three degrees .",
    "another set of ratios only involves the small and large separations between modes of degree 0 and 1 : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are 5-frequency smoothed small separations defined by equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) in @xcite .",
    "this smoothing introduces correlations between the individual ratios that more than double the effective uncertainties , but it also shifts some weight from the center of the frequency range toward the edges where the s / n of the modes is lower . to account for these correlations without shifting weight toward the edges of the frequency range , we adopted 3@xmath23 uncorrelated uncertainties on all ratios from eq.([eq : r010 ] ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite noted that the ratios formed from the highest radial orders were typically unreliable due to large line - widths , and recommended that they be excluded from the set of constraints .",
    "we excluded all ratios that are centered on frequencies from the highest three radial orders .",
    "hereafter , we refer to the set of ratios @xmath24 as @xmath25 and the set of ratios @xmath26 and @xmath27 as @xmath28 .    although the frequency ratios help to discriminate between families of models that provide comparable matches to the other sets of constraints , the individual frequencies contain additional information that we would like to exploit .",
    "the primary difficulty is that the model frequencies need to be corrected for surface effects , and the commonly - used empirical correction @xcite appears to inject a bias in the determination of some stellar properties .",
    "what is the source of this bias , and how can we mitigate it ? essentially , @xcite  assumed that the differences between the observed and optimal model frequencies can be described by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the size of the correction at a reference frequency @xmath31 ( typically chosen to be @xmath1 ) , and the exponent @xmath32 is fixed at a solar - calibrated value near 4.9 .",
    "they demonstrated that this simple parametrization to provide a better match to the observations . by definition",
    ", the best model should have @xmath33 .",
    "the net effect of applying homology scaling to every model sampled by the ga is to decrease the dynamic range of the frequency @xmath34-space , so we omitted this term from our surface correction .",
    "] can adequately describe the frequency differences between the observations and models of several solar - type stars , including @xmath35  hyi and @xmath36  cen a and b. they cautioned that the value of the exponent depends on the number of radial orders considered for the solar calibration , varying from 4.45.25 when including 713 orders . to facilitate comparisons with previous work",
    ", we adopted the solar - calibrated value @xmath37 determined by @xcite .",
    "for mixed modes we scaled the surface correction by the mode inertia ratio , as described in @xcite .",
    "the actual solar surface effect appears more linear at high frequencies @xcite , so assuming any fixed exponent will tend to over - correct the highest - order modes ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this tendency appears to interact with intrinsic parameter correlations  in particular , the well - known correlation between mass and initial helium abundance in stellar models  to favor higher - mass low - helium models that fit the frequencies better while getting the interior structure wrong . including the frequency ratios as constraints favors the lower - mass higher - helium models , but it does not eliminate the bias caused by the high - frequency modes . to mitigate this bias ,",
    "we adopted an uncertainty for each frequency that is the quadratic sum of the statistical error and half the surface correction @xcite . in doing so",
    ", we are acknowledging that surface effects represent a systematic error in the models @xcite .",
    "we also imposed a penalty on models with @xmath38 , such that the spectroscopic quality metric ( see section  [ sec3.3 ] ) was inflated by 1 for every 0.01 that @xmath15 fell below @xmath14 .",
    "although this does not explicitly rule out low - helium solutions , it does require that they provide a substantially better match to the other sets of constraints to be considered superior . without a precise constraint on the luminosity and/or radius ,",
    "this approach is required even to recover accurate solar properties from sun - as - a - star helioseismic data @xcite .",
    "frequencies and those of the amp model ( connected points ) are reasonably well represented by the empirical correction ( dashed line ) with amplitude @xmath30 at the reference frequency @xmath31 , but it substantially overestimates the correction at high frequencies.[fig2 ] ]          @xcite categorized their sample of 61 asteroseismic targets into three classes , based on the appearance of the oscillation modes in an chelle diagram @xcite . dividing the frequency spectrum into segments having width equal to the large separation and then stacking them vertically , modes with the same spherical degree form approximately vertical ridges for _ simple stars _ like the sun ( see figure  [ fig3 ] ) . significantly hotter main - sequence stars have larger intrinsic line - widths , blurring the individual modes and complicating the identification of mode geometry ( _ f - like stars _ ) .",
    "finally , the @xmath18 ridge in subgiants can be disrupted when buoyancy modes in the evolved stellar core couple with pressure modes in the envelope , creating an avoided crossing @xcite that leads to deviations from the regular frequency spacing ( _ mixed - mode stars _ ) .",
    "this final category is usually unambiguous , but there is no clear dividing line between the first two .",
    "@xcite suggested a boundary between the simple and f - like stars at an effective temperature near 6400  k or a line - width at maximum mode height around 4  @xmath39hz ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we adopted a slightly different convention based on whether or not the @xmath40 and @xmath41 ridges in the chelle diagram are cleanly separated .",
    "this led us to treat 5 stars as f - like that were identified as simple by @xcite : kic3632418 , 7206837 , 8228742 , 9139163 and 10162436 .",
    "in addition , kic3424541 ( originally classified as f - like ) and kic10018963 ( classified as simple by @xcite ) both show evidence of avoided crossings , so we treated them as mixed - mode stars .    the use of frequency ratios as additional constraints for asteroseismic model - fitting can improve the uniqueness of the solution , but the ratios can not all be used for certain types of stars . for simple stars ,",
    "the large and small spacings can be measured cleanly , and the underlying assumption that the frequencies are all pure p - modes is justified . in this case ,",
    "amp attempts to match four sets of observational constraints simultaneously : [ 1 ] the individual oscillation frequencies , with uncertainties inflated in proportion to the surface correction , [ 2 ] the ratios @xmath28 with 3@xmath23 uncorrelated statistical uncertainties , [ 3 ] the ratios @xmath25 with errors propagated from the quoted frequency uncertainties , and [ 4 ] the spectroscopic and other constraints , such as a luminosity or interferometric radius . a normalized @xmath34 is calculated for each of these sets of constraints : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the sets of @xmath45 observed and calculated quantities , and @xmath46 are the associated uncertainties .",
    "the ga then attempts to minimize the average of the @xmath34 values for the adopted sets of constraints , so future updates to amp will preserve the individual @xmath34 values for subsequent error analysis . ] .",
    "this approach recognizes that each oscillation frequency is not completely independent , but it uses the information content in several different ways to create metrics that can be traded off against each other and/or against the spectroscopic constraints .",
    "these procedures must be modified slightly for f - like and mixed - mode stars . in f - like stars ,",
    "large line - widths make the measurement of @xmath40 and @xmath41 frequencies more difficult .",
    "consequently , the small spacings @xmath47 are compromised and the ratios @xmath25 are unreliable . in this case ,",
    "set [ 3 ] above is excluded from consideration , and the ga uses the average @xmath34 for the remaining three sets of constraints . for mixed - mode stars ,",
    "the @xmath18 frequencies are not pure p - modes , so the theoretical insensitivity of the ratios @xmath28 to the near - surface layers is no longer valid and they lose their utility .",
    "this is not limited to the modes that are immediately adjacent to an avoided crossing  several radial orders on either side are generally perturbed , depending on the strength of the mode coupling @xcite .",
    "in addition , note that the ratios @xmath25 in eq.([eq : r02 ] ) depend on the large separations @xmath48 , which are also contaminated by mixed modes .",

    "a common feature in many of these diagrams is a divergence between the observations ( blue points ) and the surface corrected model frequencies ( solid red points ) , which appear to curve off towards the left at higher frequencies .",

    "thus , the primary constraints from the individual frequencies are concentrated at low frequency , while the ratios capture the information content of the higher frequencies ( excluding the highest three radial orders , see section  [ sec3.2 ] ) . forcing a better fit to the high frequency modes , under the current approach to the surface correction",

    "our previous approach to uncertainty estimation using singular value decomposition ( svd ) is no longer appropriate for several reasons .",
    "first , svd assumes that the observables are independent .",
    "this was reasonable when we were only fitting the individual frequencies and spectroscopic constraints .",
    "now that we also fit the frequency ratios @xmath25 and @xmath28 ( see section  [ sec3.2 ] ) , some of the observables are no longer independent and svd can not be used .",
    "second , even if we do not include the frequency ratios as constraints , the svd method determines the uncertainties from the local shape of the @xmath34 surface .",
    "such an analysis fails to capture the uncertainties due to non - uniqueness of the optimal solution , yielding errors that are too optimistic for practical purposes . finally , the metric used by the ga for optimization , which defines the local shape of the @xmath34 surface , is a composite of normalized @xmath34 values from several distinct sets of observables , making it difficult to interpret in a statistically robust manner .",
    "we can use the ensemble of models sampled by the ga to provide a more conservative and global estimate of the uncertainties . during an amp run ,",
    "the parameter values and average @xmath34 metric are recorded for each trial model that is compared to the observations .",
    "the nature of the fitting process ensures that each trial model is a much better match to the observations than a random model in the search space .",
    "for each stellar evolution track generated by amp , the age is optimized internally using a binary decision tree to match the observed large separation .",
    "in addition , the final age is interpolated between time steps on the track to match the lowest observed radial mode , and the empirical surface correction of @xcite is applied to improve the match to higher frequency modes . in effect , the ga is producing the best possible match to the observations given the four fixed parameters @xmath329 for each trial model .",
    "as a consequence , we need to use a subset of the full ensemble of ga models if we want a reasonable estimate of the uncertainties from the limited information that is available .",
    "to determine the number of ga trial models that we should include in our uncertainty estimation procedure , we initially attempted to match the observational error on [ m / h ] ( 0.09  dex , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as outlined briefly in section  [ sec4.1 ] , we ranked the unique trial models by their average @xmath34 value and assigned each one a relative likelihood using eq.([eq : l ] ) .",
    "this allowed us to calculate a likelihood - weighted mean and standard deviation for each adjustable model parameter , including @xmath301 and @xmath15 to generate an uncertainty on the initial composition @xmath304_{\\rm i}$ ] as we gradually included more models in the mean .",
    "we only had access to the initial value of @xmath305 , which increases at the surface over time as helium diffusion and settling operates in the models , so this only provided a first estimate of the appropriate number of models to include . the resulting uncertainty on @xmath304_{\\rm i}$ ] for our example star kic6116048 is shown in the left panel of figure  [ figa1 ] as a function of the number of models included in the likelihood - weighted mean .",
    "uncertainties on the other properties of the optimal models can only be determined after a cut on the number of models has been adopted .",
    "the cut establishes the uncertainties on the adjustable parameters @xmath330 as well as the covariance matrix around the optimal solution .",
    "this allows us to calculate a set of models that define the 1@xmath23 error ellipse , and then use half the range of values for any other property ( such as @xmath304_{\\rm s}$ ] , @xmath6 , or @xmath298 ) within the 1@xmath23 models to define an uncertainty for these non - adjustable parameters . for kic6116048",
    ", we determined that by including the best @xmath30825,000 models in the likelihood - weighted mean , the resulting uncertainty on the surface composition @xmath304_{\\rm s}$ ] ( not shown in figure  [ figa1 ] ) was comparable to the observational error on [ m / h ] . using this same cut , the full range of model values for @xmath6 within the 1@xmath23 models spanned 290  k , yielding an error estimate of @xmath331145  k ( see center panel of figure  [ figa1 ] ) .",
    "we repeated the analysis procedure with a cut at one - half and one - quarter of this number of models ( vertical dashed lines in the left panel of figure  [ figa1 ] ) until the resulting uncertainty on the model @xmath6 was below the error on the observed @xmath6 ( 84  k , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "by interpolating the number of models required to reproduce the observed @xmath6 error , we defined the appropriate cut that was then used to estimate the final uncertainties on all model properties .",
    "the center panel of figure  [ figa1 ] shows the uncertainty on the model @xmath6 for the three cuts indicated in the left panel . when the 7370 best models sampled by the ga ( vertical dotted line ) were used to calculate the likelihood - weighted mean and standard deviation for each of the adjustable model parameters , the uncertainty on the model @xmath6 from the resulting 1@xmath23 models was equal to the observational error of 84  k ( horizontal dotted line ) .",
    "the range of radii within this same set of 1@xmath23 models define the radius uncertainty of 0.0094  @xmath332 ( right panel of figure  [ figa1 ] ) . as noted in section  [ sec4.1 ] , the above procedure yields inherently conservative uncertainty estimates because it assumes that the asteroseismic data do not contribute to the determination of @xmath6 in the final solution .",
    "this assumption is certainly not valid for the surface composition , even ignoring the complications from diffusion , which explains why the final uncertainty on @xmath304_{\\rm i}$ ] is well below the observational error on [ m / h ] .",
    "we repeated the above procedure for each star in our sample to yield the final set of uncertainties , which appear in table  [ tab1 ] ."
