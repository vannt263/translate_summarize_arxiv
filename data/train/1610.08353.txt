    "the section can be considered as a field of slopes @xmath16 , i.e. as a distribution of @xmath1-dimensional planes in the space @xmath15 .",
    "we shall say that a manifold @xmath17 is imbedded into the field @xmath16 , if @xmath18",
    ".    given @xmath19 , to find the strong minimum of the functional @xmath20 over @xmath21-manifolds @xmath22 defined in @xmath0 subject to the boundary conditions @xmath23 .",
    "the natural necessary condition of minimum of the functional is the non - negativity of the second variation ( @xcite - @xcite ) .",
    "thorough investigation of the second variation for multiple integral is due to a.clebsch .",
    "he studied dirichlet functional    @xmath24 dt^i.\\ ] ]    the symbol `` hat '' over a function ( say , @xmath25 ) means that into all its arguments one substitutes the extremal @xmath26 . by using ideas of many - dimensional riccati techniques",
    "clebsch presupposed the existence of solution to partial differential riccati - type equation .",
    "now we know that it is the many - dimensional counterpart of the condition of absence of the conjugate points . using this solution he transforms variables and reduces the functional to its principal part , that is to the quadratic form from the converted first derivatives of desired functions .",
    "hence , he almost proved the weak local minimum of the functional .",
    "it seems that clebsch had in mind that for multiple integral it is valid the direct similarity of legendre condition : the non - negativity of the second variation follows the non - negativity of the principal part of the quadratic form , defined on all @xmath27-matrices @xmath28    in the work of j.hadamard  @xmath29 , which was published half a century after the work of clebsch , it was shown that it is not truly .",
    "hadamard clarified that the quadratic form of principal members is not obliged to be non - negative on the set of all matrices .",
    "he finds the following necessary condition of non - negativity of the second variation .    .",
    "let the functional    ^2 f = _",
    "v dt^i [ 5 ] be non - negative for @xmath30 that satisfies to boundary condition    @xmath31    then for all values of @xmath32 , the quadratic form @xmath33 takes non - negative values on all @xmath27-matrices of the form @xmath34 ( that is on all matrices of rank one ) .",
    "the theorem can be reformulated as follows : the biquadratic form @xmath35 is non - negative for all values @xmath32 and @xmath36 .",
    "the gap between necessary and sufficient conditions was essentially diminished by van hove  @xcite . at the end of 40-th years",
    "he proved that the natural amplification of the hadamard - legendre condition :      the idea of the van hove s proof is as follows .",
    "firstly , we freeze coefficients .",
    "that means that arguments @xmath37 in coefficients of the quadratic form standing under the sign of the integral  ( [ 5 ] ) are fixed .",
    "( this does not affect on needed estimations because one can chose as the domain of integration an arbitrary small neighbourhood of the given point ) . secondly .",
    "we apply to the functional obtained ( that has constant coefficients ) the fourier transformation and then use the parseval equality .",
    "the proof provides an explanation of the fact  why the hadamard - legendre condition uses only matrices of the rank one .",
    "the operator of differentiation transits under the fourier transform into the operator of multiplication by independent variable . if the fourier - image of the function @xmath38 is @xmath39 , then the fourier - image of its derivative @xmath40 will be @xmath41 . as a result ,",
    "in the integrand of the parseval equality arises biquadratic form and the inequality ( [ 6 ] ) assures the positivity of the variation .",
    "the condition  ( [ 6 ] ) relates to the notion of hyperbolicity of non - linear euler systems for non - stationary processes .",
    "it provides the correctness of cauchy problem for systems with the same coefficients under higher derivatives  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath42 the set of matrices of the rank 1 .    considering candidates for extension of functional like that of  ( [ 1 ] )",
    ", it will be interesting to use the space @xmath43  functions of bounded variation on the space @xmath44 .",
    "let @xmath45 .",
    "we will consider @xmath46 in the sense of distributions as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 .",
    "such extensions was used in the theory of minimal surfaces and in plasticity theory ( see , for example , @xmath49 ) .",
    "the function @xmath50 is the function of bounded variation if @xmath51    the following claim is evident :    let @xmath52 is open and @xmath53 converges in @xmath54 to a function @xmath50 .",
    "then @xmath55    the space @xmath56 is the banach - space with the norm @xmath57    let us note that @xmath43 contains characteristic functions @xmath58 of open bounded sets @xmath59 with smooth boundaries",
    ". indeed , denote by @xmath60 the @xmath61-dimensional measure of the boundary of the set @xmath62 .",
    "then @xmath63    hence , @xmath56 contains discontinuous functions and thus using of this class of functions would need additional restrictions on growth of integrand @xmath50 . using the discontinuous variations would give much more simple proof of the maximum principle .",
    "but we prefer to restrict ourselves only by the assumption of the strong minimum that is achieved on a separate trajectory .    to prove the main theorem of the work it will be sufficient to consider the extension of f that is obtained by adding to @xmath64 the following rather narrow space of piece - wise linear functions @xmath65 . let the domain @xmath66 in the space @xmath67 be bounded by a polyhedron @xmath68 .",
    "let @xmath69 be the simplicial division of @xmath68 .",
    "the space @xmath65 consists of continuous piece - wise linear functions @xmath70 with the support in @xmath71 and with values in one - dimensional space @xmath72 . the value of the integral f equals to sum of its values over all simplexes .",
    "it is clear that such functions can be approximated by smooth ones in @xmath21-metric .",
    "it is sufficient to smooth out angles between any two adjacent simplexes using cylindrical surface with the generator parallel to its intersection , and then smoothly to seam these cylinders .    in the construction of weyl @xmath73 , it is used the trace of the product of matrices as a scalar product .",
    "so , the part of pontryagin s function @xmath74 will play    @xmath75 .",
    "other forms of the scalar products ( scalar products in spaces of external degrees ) give another forms of weierstrass functions that was introduced and used in the work ( @xcite ) .",

    "thus the scalar product of @xmath79  the solution to the equation @xmath80 and the solution of the variational equation @xmath78 remains constant .",
    "indeed ,    [ q^i_(x)^]= q^i _ ( x)^- q^i _ ( x)^=0 [ 12 ]    the immediate sequence of @xmath81 is the following lemma :    let @xmath82 be an optimal solution and @xmath83 be the solution of weyl s canonical system @xmath76 .",

    "what follows , all measures ( volume , length and so on ) will be given without regard for the constant thickness @xmath93 .    the external normal vector to @xmath97 in the plane @xmath67 is @xmath88 .",

    "the main face @xmath116 , having the constant slope , tends to zero in @xmath117-metric ; its equation is @xmath118 .",
    "now we have one more argument in favour of using rank one matrices .",

    "it remains the integral along the moving face @xmath140 .",
    "-_p ( ) dt^i_n-1 .",
    "[ 15 ] the sign `` minus '' is due to the fact that the orientation of the face @xmath140 which is induced by the face @xmath120 is opposite to the orientation that was induced by the face @xmath116 . as it is usual for variational equations the value of @xmath151",
    "is calculated relative to the fixed values of @xmath5 .",
