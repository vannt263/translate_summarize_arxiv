    "a large fraction of the final state in hadron - hadron , electron - hadron ( both high @xmath0 and low @xmath0 , the latter also being referred to as photon - hadron ) , and electron - positron collisions consists of high energy jets .",
    "these jets have an extended structure which can be studied experimentally and theoretically .",
    "a possible measure of this structure is the jet shape or jet profile , which depends on variables like transverse energy and rapidity of the jets , the jet algorithm , and the extension of jets .",
    "the jet shape measure is the function @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the transverse energy of the jet and @xmath8 is its rapidity with @xmath9 , its azimuthal angle , integrated out .",
    "this function @xmath10 measures the fractional @xmath7 profile , i.e.  given a jet sample with transverse energy @xmath7 defined with a cone radius @xmath11 , @xmath6 is the average fraction of the jet s transverse energy that lies inside an inner cone with radius @xmath12 .",
    "+ this jet shape @xmath10 for the special value @xmath13 has been measured for the first time in @xmath2 collisions at @xmath14 = 630 gev by the ua1 collaboration @xcite at the @xmath15 collider .",
    "more detailed measurements of @xmath10 in @xmath2 collisions at @xmath14 = 1800 gev at the tevatron have been performed with the collider detector cdf @xcite . here , the dependences of the jet shape @xmath10 on the transverse energy @xmath7 and on @xmath16 were studied for jets produced in the central region @xcite and compared with theoretical calculations .",
    "the measured jets at cdf have sufficiently high @xmath7 of order 100 gev , so that one can assume that gluon emission effects are much more important than long - distance fragmentation processes or soft interactions with `` spectator '' partons in determining the jet shape function @xmath6 .",
    "this means that at sufficiently high energies , the shape of the jet should be calculable by perturbative qcd alone ignoring fragmentation effects and other soft interactions .",
    "such calculations of @xmath10 based on @xmath3 finite - order perturbative qcd for @xmath2 collisions were first performed by ellis , kunszt and soper ( eks ) @xcite and the results were compared to the cdf data @xcite .",
    "+ the production of high transverse energy jets by quasi - real photons on protons ( low @xmath0 @xmath1 scattering ) has some similarity to jet production in @xmath2 collisions .",
    "as is well known , two mechanisms contribute to the photoproduction of jets at large transverse energy .",
    "the photon can either interact directly or via its quark and gluon content , the resolved contribution , with the partons originating from the proton .",
    "the resolved photoproduction dominates at hera for lower @xmath7 and positive rapidities @xmath8 ( we assign @xmath17 in the direction of the incoming proton ) . near the maximum of the rapidity distribution @xmath18 ,",
    "the resolved and direct parts become comparable at @xmath19 gev . due to the dominance of the resolved component ,",
    "jet shapes in low @xmath0 @xmath1 collisions should be rather similar to jet shapes in @xmath2 jet production .",
    "next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd calculations of jet shapes at hera for the resolved component have been presented some time ago @xcite . their similarity to jet shapes in @xmath2 collisions has been studied in @xcite showing that due to a simple scaling behavior jet shapes for different c.m .",
    "energies and reactions can be correlated .",
    "this scaling behavior was used by the h1 collaboration to compare jet profiles as measured in @xmath4 reactions @xcite with the jet profiles obtained from @xmath2 data @xcite .",
    "+ recently , the zeus collaboration presented their first results for jet shape functions @xmath10 in @xmath1 collisions @xcite .",
    "they studied jet shapes @xmath6 in inclusive single - jet and dijet photoproduction for jets with @xmath20 gev , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 as a function of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and the inner cone radius @xmath16 .",
    "these measurements show that @xmath10 changes appreciably with @xmath8 and @xmath7 for fixed @xmath16 . in this work",
    "we shall calculate @xmath10 for the experimental conditions of the zeus measurements in nlo including direct and resolved contributions to find out whether the behavior of @xmath10 with varying @xmath8 and @xmath7 found by zeus can be explained by fixed - order perturbative calculations .",
    "in particular we shall investigate how the merging of partons in relation to the merging procedure in the experimental analysis can be exploited to obtain a satisfactory description of the experimental results . with the same attitude we shall investigate jet shapes in @xmath2 collisions at the tevatron and compare our results with measurements of cdf @xcite and d0 @xcite in different rapidity and transverse energy regions .",
    "+ the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss in detail the merging procedure in the theoretical calculations and in the experimental analysis of low @xmath0 @xmath1 collisions . in section 3",
    "we compare our numerical results with the recent zeus data .",
    "the @xmath2 jet shapes are considered in section 4 .",
    "the results of the calculation and the comparison with cdf and d0 data are given .",
    "section 5 summarizes our results and ends with some concluding remarks .",
    "we consider positrons with energy @xmath23 gev colliding with protons of energy @xmath24 gev .",
    "the photon emission is described by the weizscker - williams equivalent photon approximation with a formula as in @xcite with @xmath25 gev@xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the fraction of the initial positron energy transferred to the photon , in accordance with the conditions of the zeus measurements @xcite . for the resolved contribution",
    "we need the parton densities of the photon . we take them from the work of glck , reya , and vogt @xcite converted to the @xmath29 scheme .",
    "the parton distributions of the proton are taken from cteq4 m in the @xmath29 scheme @xcite .",
    "both are nlo parametrizations .",
    "the details of these structure functions are not essential , since @xmath10 is a ratio of cross sections . for @xmath30",
    "we employ the one - loop formula with @xmath31 and with @xmath32 taken from the proton density @xmath33 mev ) .",
    "we decided on the one - loop expression for @xmath34 since the jet shape is calculated only to lowest non - trivial order @xmath35 .",
    "the renormalization scale @xmath36 is set equal to the factorization scales and is put equal to @xmath7 . + for calculating the jet profile @xmath10 we need a jet definition .",
    "we adopt the cone algorithm of the snowmass convention @xcite . according to this definition",
    "a jet is defined as transverse energy @xmath7 deposited in a cone of radius @xmath11 in the rapidity - azimuthal angle plane .",
    "the jet axis is determined from @xmath37 @xmath38 with the transverse energy calculated from @xmath39 a parton with kinematic variables @xmath40 is included in the jet if the condition @xmath41 is satisfied .",
    "since we have only up to three partons in the final state , not more than two partons can be combined into one jet .",
    "since the jet shape @xmath10 is fully determined from the @xmath42 parton transition cross section we have the situation that the final state consists either of three or of two jets , where one of the jets resulted from the recombination out of two partons in the 3-parton final state .",
    "+ as is well known this jet definition has two problems : double counting and merging .",
    "the condition ( 4 ) is equivalent to @xmath43 i.e.  if the parton angles of partons @xmath44 and @xmath45 satisfy this condition , they are counted as one combined jet with transverse energy @xmath46 , but not as two smaller jets with energies @xmath47 and @xmath48 . for the case that @xmath49 which occurs , for example , for @xmath50 , the two partons @xmath44 and @xmath45 might with some justification count also as separate jets .",
    "therefore one has the choice to count only the combined jet @xmath51 and @xmath52 or to count @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 as separate jets which would contribute to the inclusive single - jet cross section .",
    "we follow eks @xcite and count only the combined jet in this case . this way we avoid any double counting of jets . in practice",
    "it is found , however , that the jet shape @xmath10 is unaffected by the double counting issue of jet recombination except at @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "+ the issue of merging is much more severe . it is related to the problem whether the cone algorithm used in the theoretical nlo calculation matches the jet definition in the experimental analysis .",
    "this problem can not be solved easily since in the experimental measurement of @xmath10 one starts with the observation of hadrons which are recombined into protojets with a cone algorithm similar to the snowmass definition .",
    "these protojets are recombined further until the conditions of the algorithm which include merging of overlapping cones are satisfied .",
    "the details of the algorithm used by the zeus collaboration will be described later .",
    "it is clear , however , that without further investigations it is not possible to decide that cone algorithms used for three parton final states match the cone algorithms used in the recombination of final state hadrons in the zeus analysis .",
    "+ the theoretical jet algorithm we are using will merge two partons into a single jet whenever the condition ( 5 ) is satisfied .",
    "this includes also the configuration when two partons with equal transverse energy @xmath50 are just @xmath56 apart . in the calculation",
    "this is counted as one jet of transverse energy @xmath7 with a cone centered between the two partons .",
    "this means that for this case the @xmath7 of the jet is distributed at the edge at the cone and not in the vicinity of the center .",
    "whether such a configuration will be counted as a single jet also in the experimental analysis will , of course , depend on the details of the jet algorithm used in the experiment .",
    "this problem was recognized by eks @xcite when they calculated jet shapes @xmath10 for @xmath2 collisions and compared them with the cdf data @xcite . to simulate the merging and other conditions of the cdf cone algorithm in a simple way they added the extra constraint , that two partons , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , when separated by more than @xmath57 , i.e.  when @xmath58 are no longer merged into a single jet . with this additional constraint the fraction of @xmath7 near the edge of the cone",
    "is reduced .",
    "eks also found that @xmath59 describes the jet shape @xmath10 as a function of @xmath16 for @xmath60 gev jets as measured by cdf very well .",
    "this means that for simulating the cdf cone algorithm the @xmath5 constraint with @xmath59 should be introduced on the parton level . of course , this value for @xmath5 accounts only for the ideal situation of high @xmath7 jets at cdf with very small fragmentation , underlying event , and other effects , which might distort the relation of the cdf cone algorithm to the algorithm employed on the parton level . from this",
    "we conclude that the jet merging in the cdf analysis can be simulated on the parton level with the parameter @xmath57 which reduces the merging of partons at the cone edge . for @xmath61 gev jets @xmath62 . for lower @xmath7",
    "s we expect additional broadening of the jets which we might simulate with @xmath5 values slightly larger than @xmath63 .",
    "therefore we consider @xmath5 a parameter which is not fixed completely and depends on the kinematical parameters of the final state jets .",
    "before we decide which @xmath5 values should be assumed for the photoproduction of jets at hera we shall describe the jet algorithm employed in the zeus analysis .      in the zeus jet search and the measurement of the jet shape",
    "@xmath10 @xcite a cone algorithm @xcite is used to construct jets on the basis of the energy depositions in the uranium - scintillator calorimeter ( cal ) cells in both data and simulated events and also from the final state hadrons in the simulated events .",
    "whether hadrons or cal cells are considered is not essential .",
    "the following steps are taken to construct jets .",
    "cal cells are considered with their @xmath8 and @xmath9 determined from the unit vectors joining the vertex of the interaction and the geometric centers of the cells . in the first step , each cal cell with a transverse energy above 0.3 gev is considered as a seed for the search .",
    "these seeds are combined if their distance in @xmath64 space @xmath65 . the cone radius @xmath22 is drawn around each seed and the cal cells within that cone are combined to form a cluster .",
    "the axis of the cluster is defined according to the snowmass conventions @xcite .",
    "this yields @xmath66 and @xmath67 which follow from the transverse energy weighted mean pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle of all the cal cells belonging to this cluster ( see ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) ) . a new cone of radius @xmath22",
    "is then drawn around the axis of the resulting cluster .",
    "all cells with their geometric center inside the cone are used to recalculate a new cluster axis .",
    "the procedure is iterated until the content of the cluster is stable .",
    "up to this point the algorithm is very similar to the jet definition at the parton level which we use to produce our predictions for comparison with the experimental data .",
    "of course , with only three partons in the final state , the procedure is much simpler .",
    "iterations are not needed and the possibilities for merging are very limited , since maximally only two partons can be merged . + the difference to the theoretical algorithm occurs in the treatment of overlapping clusters . in the zeus analysis",
    "two clusters are merged when the common transverse energy exceeds 75% of the total transverse energy of the cluster with the smallest transverse energy .",
    "otherwise two different clusters are formed and the overlapping cells are assigned to the nearest cluster . finally a cluster is called a jet if the corrected @xmath7 exceeds 14 gev . concerning the rapidity only jets with @xmath8 in the range @xmath68 are selected .",
    "+ we emphasize that in this experimental procedure of defining jets there are several steps that have no analogy in the theoretical jet definition with only three partons in the final state .",
    "first , in the experimental definition iterations are needed to define stable clusters .",
    "second , there is the merging of two clusters depending on the shared energy . in the theoretical definition",
    "there is neither an iteration nor shared energy .",
    "the latter would only occur in a theoretical analysis with at least four partons in the final state , i.e. if we went to one order higher in the qcd calculation .",
    "in this case we have nnlo two - jet , nlo three - jet , or lo four - jet production . in @xmath69 , where there is only nlo two - jet and lo",
    "three - jet production , merging of partons occurs only once , so that iterations and overlapping cones do not arise .",
    "+ the energy sharing and merging of overlapping clusters in the zeus analysis is the same procedure as used by the cdf collaboration to define jets in @xmath2 collisions . in both measurements ,",
    "jets are constructed with the choice @xmath70 .",
    "therefore we expect that the jet definition in the zeus analysis corresponds to @xmath71 in the merging of partons for the theoretical jet algorithm at least for the ideal case of large @xmath7 and/or jet production in the backward direction . for negative @xmath8",
    "s the jet production is a superposition of nearly equal contributions from direct and resolved production with @xmath72 ( @xmath73 is the fraction of the initial positron energy transferred to the photon ) . in this region",
    "there is little disturbance of the jets through additional interaction with the remnants . in the region",
    "@xmath74 the measured transverse energy flow around the jet axis is described reasonably well without extra multiple interactions included in the monte carlo @xcite .",
    "this is already the case for rather low @xmath7 but improves the larger the @xmath7 is . of course",
    ", the introduction of the @xmath5 parameter into the theoretical jet definition can only be a phenomenological device to model the much more involved experimental jet definition .",
    "+ further information on @xmath5 can be gained from a study of experimental and theoretical jet definitions for photoproduction @xcite .",
    "in this study inclusive dijet cross sections d@xmath75d@xmath76 with @xmath77 gev and @xmath78 for direct and resolved photoproduction as a function of the average pseudorapidity of two observed jets @xmath79 were compared for three jet definitions denoted eucell , pucell and ktclus .",
    "the first two definitions are cone algorithms whereas ktclus is a cluster algorithm .",
    "pucell is identical to the jet definition described above .",
    "ktclus is equivalent to the cone algorithm with @xmath80 .",
    "the inclusive dijet cross sections vary with the jet definitions .",
    "eucell corresponds to @xmath5 = 2 and yields the largest cross sections .",
    "calculations with the herwig monte carlo @xcite reveal that the cross sections with pucell are larger ( almost equal ) compared to the ktclus cross section for resolved ( direct ) production .",
    "the resolved ( direct ) cross sections are again defined with the @xmath81 @xmath82 cut . by comparing with the eucell @xmath83 cross section we conclude that the resolved pucell cross section corresponds to a cross section which we would obtain in the nlo calculation with @xmath84 .",
    "this is consistent with recent measurements of these dijet cross section with different jet definitions @xcite .",
    "here for the enriched resolved @xmath85 sample @xmath86 the cross section for pucell is approximately 30% larger than the ktclus cross section .",
    "both cross sections have appreciable errors , so that definite conclusions about equivalent @xmath5 values are difficult to obtain",
    ". furthermore for the measurement of jet shapes only inclusive single jets are considered so that it is not justified to read off the exact values for @xmath5 from the dijet analysis described above .",
    "however , we are confident that for the pucell algorithm @xmath87 must be assumed when applied to the calculation of jet shapes where the resolved component is dominant . from earlier calculations @xcite we know that @xmath10 depends sensitively on @xmath5 .",
    "the larger @xmath5 is the broader the jets are .",
    "+ the jet shapes for the reaction @xmath88 have been measured for jets with @xmath89 gev integrated over four non - overlapping @xmath8 regions @xmath90 , and @xmath91 and are presented also in four @xmath7 regions @xmath92 and @xmath93 integrated always over the same @xmath8 interval @xmath68",
    ". it would not be reasonable to insist that the jet shapes @xmath10 for these different @xmath8 and @xmath7 regions should be calculated always with the same @xmath5 parameter .",
    "we expect @xmath62 for the @xmath8 interval @xmath94 where direct and resolved production contribute in nearly equal amounts and it is known that single - jet production in this region is dominated by @xmath95 . away from the backward",
    "( direct ) region we expect increasingly broader jets the more we approach the forward direction @xmath96 .",
    "we know from earlier investigations that the single inclusive jet cross section as a function of @xmath8 for @xmath97 as measured by zeus @xcite does not agree with the nlo prediction in the region @xmath98 @xcite , the experimental cross sections are larger than the theoretical ones .",
    "this excess of the cross section from @xmath98 could be simulated in the pythia monte carlo @xcite by adding multiple interactions .",
    "these multiple interactions , which apply only to resolved processes , consist of interactions between partons in the proton and photon remnants calculated as lo processes and generated in addition to the primary hard scattering .",
    "these multiple interactions lead to an energy flow outside the core of the jet due to a possible underlying event . in @xcite",
    "it was found that these multiple interaction effects on the jet shapes are small in the region @xmath99 , but increase gradually with @xmath8 in the region @xmath100 , where an improved description of the data is obtained . in our nlo calculation",
    "we shall describe this excess of energy outside of the core of the jet with a gradual increase of @xmath5 towards @xmath101 .",
    "as already introduced in section 1 , for a sample of jets of transverse energy @xmath7 , defined with a cone radius @xmath11 , the jet shape @xmath6 is the average fraction of the jet s transverse energy that lies inside an inner cone with radius @xmath12 , which is concentric with the jet defining cone . then the quantity @xmath102 stands for the fraction of @xmath7 that lies in the cone segment between @xmath16 and @xmath11",
    "this is given , up to higher order terms in @xmath34 , by @xmath103 where the integral in the numerator is performed over the cone segment between @xmath16 and @xmath11 .",

    "the integration does not include the collinear singularities which are at @xmath105 .",

    "furthermore @xmath10 depends sensitively on @xmath5 .",
    "the jets become broader with increasing @xmath5 . neither @xmath5 = 2 nor @xmath5 = 1.4 agree with the data in the four @xmath8 regions . however , this is to be expected according to the discussion in the previous section .",
    "in the first @xmath8 interval , @xmath112 , the data are very well accounted for with @xmath5 = 1.3 , which is the value we anticipated for the ideal situation with no extra broadening due to multiple interaction effects with the remnants . with increasing @xmath8 the value of @xmath5 must be increased monotonically up to @xmath5 = 1.8 in the fourth @xmath8 interval , @xmath110 . due to the additional broadening from multiple scattering effects towards @xmath113 we expect this increase of @xmath5 with increasing @xmath8 .",

    "thus @xmath5 increases with decreasing @xmath7 as we expect it from the comparison with the zeus data .",

    "[ plot9 ] looks very similar to that in fig .",
    "[ plot4 ] for the zeus data . here also the variation of @xmath5 with @xmath7 was small @xmath134 similar to @xmath135 for the cdf data ) .",
    "last year the d0 collaboration at the tevatron presented their jet shape data @xcite covering a similar kinematic range as cdf .",
    "their data were used to populate four non - overlapping jet @xmath7 ranges of 45 - 70 , 70 - 105 , 105 - 140 , and greater than 140 gev .",
    "the jets were analyzed in a central region @xmath136 and a forward region @xmath137 . in the forward region",
    "the data were collected only in the first two @xmath7 bins . in the experimental analysis jets",
    "were reconstructed using a fixed cone algorithm with @xmath22 .",
    "the preclusters were constructed using the snowmass jet direction definitions in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "after a stable jet center was found , the jet direction was redefined using the d0 jet direction definition @xmath138 @xmath139 where the jet polar angle @xmath140 this definition of the jet direction differs from the commonly used snowmass definition given in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) above .",
    "+ the merging of overlapping jets was done similarly as in the cdf and zeus analyses .",
    "two jets were merged into one jet if more than 50% of the @xmath7 of the jet with the smaller @xmath7 was contained in the overlap region .",
    "if less than 50% of the @xmath7 was contained in the overlap region , the jets were split into two distinct jets , where the energy in the overlap region was assigned to the nearest jet .",
    "+ after this procedure the jet directions were recalculated with the d0 conventions described above .",
    "so the main difference in the d0 cone algorithm is the definition of the jet direction .",
    "this influences both the data and the theoretical predictions for the jet shape .",
    "it was found , however , that the measured jet shapes hardly change , when instead of the d0 definition for the jet direction the snowmass definition was used . in the central region",
    "@xmath141 the change of @xmath10 was @xmath142 at most ( for the inner subcone ) and not more than 4% for jets in the forward region @xmath143 @xcite .",
    "however , on the theoretical side the jet shapes using the two jet definitions were much more different .",
    "in particular the forward produced jets are much wider with the d0 definition than with the snowmass definition .",
    "furthermore the corresponding theoretical jet shapes did not agree at all with the experimental data .",
    "thus , whereas the experimental data are relatively insensitive to the choice of jet direction definition , the theoretical predictions vary appreciably .",
    "this latter point was studied further by glover and kosower @xcite .",
    "they showed that d0 s jet direction definition is not as perturbatively stable as the snowmass definition .",
    "therefore they concluded that the d0 recombination scheme should not be applied for the purpose of making a quantitative comparison with fixed order perturbation theory .",
    "since the difference of the measured jet shapes between the two schemes of jet direction definition is so small , we shall in the following assume that the data of d0 @xcite are obtained with the snowmass definition and shall compare them with our prediction obtained with this algorithm .",
    "+ our results for @xmath10 as a function of @xmath16 are plotted in fig .  [ plot10 ] ,    ( 13,8.7 )    ( 13,5 )    separated into the four @xmath7 bins and for @xmath144 . the curves in fig .",
    "[ plot10 ] are for fixed @xmath5 = 1.4 and @xmath5 = 2.0 and for an optimized @xmath5 ( full curve ) to produce the best fit to the d0 data .",
    "the fitted @xmath5 s vary between 1.5 ( lowest @xmath7 bin ) to 1.2 for the @xmath145 gev measurements .",
    "so @xmath5 decreases with increasing @xmath7 and @xmath5 = 1.3 for the second largest bin agrees quite well with the @xmath5 obtained for the cdf data in the same @xmath7 range .",
    "we observe again , that the variation of @xmath5 is small , @xmath146 = 0.3 similar to our result obtained from the comparison with the cdf data .",
    "+ the same plots for jet production in the forward direction , @xmath147 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ plot11 ] .",
    "here we have only two @xmath7 intervals .",
    "the fitted @xmath5 is @xmath5 = 1.5 in both @xmath7 bins , but @xmath5 = 1.4 also gives a reasonably good description .",
    "+ if we fix @xmath16 = 0.5 , the corresponding @xmath10 as a function of @xmath7 is seen in fig .",
    "[ plot12 ]    ( 13,8.7 )    for the case of the central jets .",
    "we see that a slight change of @xmath5 is needed to reproduce the data similar to the result from fig .",
    "[ plot9 ] . for the d0 data",
    "this is even more convincing than for the cdf data since the range of @xmath7 , where experimental data exist , is now larger .",
    "+ from this comparison of jet shapes measured in @xmath2 collisions at @xmath14 = 1.8 tev we conclude that we obtain a quantitative description of the data when we consider a varying parameter @xmath5 which decreases as a function of @xmath7 and is equal to @xmath5 = 1.3 for @xmath7 = 100 gev jets .",
    "the variation of @xmath5 , needed to explain the measurements in the considered @xmath7 range , is rather small , @xmath148 in agreement with the findings for jets produced in @xmath4 collision at @xmath14 = 300 gev .",
    "+ so far we have not mentioned that our theoretical predictions depend on the choice of the renormalization and factorization scales which we have set equal to @xmath7 . since the jet profile @xmath102 as given in ( 8) is a lo prediction , i.e. is @xmath108 , the dependence on the scales is stronger than in a genuine nlo result which includes corrections @xmath149 .",
    "according to ( 8) the quantity @xmath102 is a ratio of cross sections .",
    "therefore we expect that the dependence on the factorization scale cancels to a large extent and @xmath102 depends essentially only on the renormalization scale @xmath36 .",
    "when @xmath36 is decreased , @xmath34 increases , so that @xmath102 increases , i.e.  the jets become broader . in principle",
    "we could repeat the analysis by varying @xmath36 in the interval @xmath150 as is usually done .",
    "however , such a variation of @xmath36 has very little influence on @xmath116 for @xmath151 @xcite . for @xmath152",
    "the change of @xmath116 is noticeable .",
    "thus the fits to the data might even improve in this range of @xmath16 , when @xmath5 and @xmath36 are optimized simultaneously .",
    "this would not change the trend of the @xmath5 variation with decreasing @xmath7 . only the optimized @xmath5 values would change slightly .",
    "furthermore , for small @xmath152 , the jet shape @xmath116 is not predicted very well , since in the region @xmath153 higher order corrections become more and more important .",
    "the change of @xmath10 with @xmath5 occurs also for large @xmath16 , where the predictions are more reliable and the data have smaller errors . from this",
    "we conclude that the @xmath5 values deduced from the data should not be very sensitive to the choice of the renormalization scale .",
    "the same conclusion can be drawn concerning our choice of the one - loop formula for @xmath34 versus the two - loop formula fixing the @xmath32 value through the parton distribution of the proton .",
    "making other choices is just equivalent to small changes of the renormalization scale .",
    "we have calculated jet shapes in photoproduction superimposing direct and resolved contributions and in @xmath2 collisions in next - to - leading order of perturbation theory .",
    "the dependences of the jet shapes on transverse energy , rapidity , and inner cone extension were compared with recent data from zeus at hera and from cdf and d0 at the tevatron .",
    "the numerical results were obtained using the snowmass cone algorithm yielding good agreement with the data , if the problem of merging overlapping jets and additional jet broadening effects are taken into account by varying the parameter @xmath5 as a function of transverse energy and rapidity . the optimal values and variations of @xmath5 with @xmath7",
    "were found to be rather similar in low @xmath0 @xmath1 and in @xmath2 collisions .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that the convex shape of the jet profile rapidity distribution in photoproduction is due to the direct photon contribution .",
