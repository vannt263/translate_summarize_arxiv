    "the red rectangle ( hd 44179 ) is a nearby ( 710 pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) post - asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star .",
    "the post - agb phase is a relatively short - lived phase ( 10@xmath110@xmath2 years ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the post - main - sequence evolution of stars with @xmath3 during which the central star sheds its dusty circumstellar shell .",
    "the red rectangle is known to contain a central binary system @xcite .",
    "its close distance and rare evolutionary status makes the red rectangle a host for many phenomena not observed elsewhere in the galaxy .",
    "it is for instance the only stellar source exhibiting the extended red emission ( ere ; * ? ? ?",
    "the red rectangle is also known to show a complex circumstellar chemistry . using the infrared space observatory ( iso )",
    "@xcite showed that both silicates and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) are present in the nebula .",
    "the oxygen - rich silicates are thought to be located in the circumbinary disk , while the carbon - rich pahs are found in the significantly less dense bipolar outflows .",
    "the spectrometers onboard iso lacked the resolution to confirm this theory , but ground - based observations @xcite support the idea that the pahs are predominantly present in the outflow .",
    "imaging obtained with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) shows that the outflows have an inhomogeneous structure , probably reflecting variations in the density @xcite .",
    "these different densities may give rise to a variation in dust condensates in the outflows .",
    "we observed the northern outflow with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) onboard the spitzer space telescope to look for compositional variations in the dust .",
    "although ground - based observations do have better spatial resolution , they lack the sensitivity of the irs .",
    "we performed irs high resolution spectroscopy on three positions in the outflow of the red rectangle .",
    "the positions were chosen in the northern outflow , about 30@xmath4 away from the central star ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pos ] ) .",
    "observations were done in irs staring mode , with integration times of 62.92 seconds for the short high ( sh ) observations and 58.72 seconds for the long high ( lh ) observations . in this work",
    "we will only discuss the sh data , since substantial calibration difficulties with the lh data still exist .",
    "the s10.5 standard pipeline data were reduced using smart @xcite , with the remark that extended source calibration is still primitive .",
    "[ fig : pos ] shows the full slit spectral extractions of each of the six positions , for the sh module .",
    "the spectra are incredibly rich , with significant variations between the different pointings .",
    "shortwards of 13 @xmath0 m the spectra are dominated by out - of - plane ( oop ) bending modes of the pahs @xcite .",
    "longwards of 13 @xmath0 m broad emission bands dominate the spectrum , hereafter referred to as the mir bands .",
    "they are comparable in strength to the oops , or in some cases even stronger .",
    "it was a surprise to see these bands , as there is no sign of similar spectral structure in the iso spectroscopy @xcite , nor do we see such bands anywhere else .",
    "the carrier is unknown .",
    "the mir bands have some peculiar properties .",
    "first of all , the bands are very strong compared to the oop bending modes in pahs , thus making an identification with pah - like species virtually impossible . longwards of 13 @xmath0 m pahs do show spectral features like the pah plateau @xcite but these resonances are weak compared to the oops .",
    "additional properties suggest that the carrier of the bands is a solid state condensate : the resonances are very wide , and the peak positions are shifting from position to position , perhaps due to a change in grain properties or composition .",
    "the bands are very strong compared to the continuum .",
    "not many dust components are known to show resonances in this wavelength range .",
    "we found that besides pahs no materials normally found in carbon - rich environments show resonances with the properties described above . on the other hand ,",
    "some oxygen - rich components are known to have resonances somewhere in the 13 - 20 @xmath0 m range , which are detected in some astrophysical environments .",
    "a 19.5 @xmath0 m feature seen around agb stars has been assigned to magnesium - iron - oxides @xcite , and in red giants features at 13 and 17 @xmath0 m are possibly to be due to spinels @xcite .",
    "trend analysis in a large number of iso spectra shows that the observed features are always found at the same wavelengths and are relatively narrow @xcite , they do not show the large variety of peak positions observed in the outflow of the red rectangle .",
    "it turns out that ( mg , fe)o provides a good identification for the features , especially longwards of 17 @xmath0 m .",
    "a variation in fe - content explains the shift in peak position . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ident ] , it is clear from interpolation that the strong 17.5 @xmath0 m feature observed in one of the nods of position a can be explained with a material slightly more mg - rich than mg@xmath5fe@xmath6o . in the right hand panel ,",
    "sub slit extractions in position b show that the fe - content of the ( mg , fe)o causes the resonance to shift in peak position . the broad feature between 1316",
    "@xmath0 m remains unidentified , but seems to correlate with the longer wavelength ( 1820 @xmath0 m ) feature in peak position shift ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ident ] ) , and could therefore perhaps be explained by oxide - rich composite grains .",
    "other components could include spinel or silicates , which could cause a shift to shorter wavelengths for the pure oxide feature .",
    "the rich variety of features longwards of 13 @xmath0 m seen in the outflow of the red rectangle is possibly carried by simple oxides , and composite grains containing those oxides .",
    "the presence of such oxygen - rich species in the carbon - rich outflow is rather surprising .",
    "explanations may include that these oxides are relicts from an earlier mass loss phase , when the outflow was still oxygen - rich .",
    "alternatively the presence of these oxides may be caused by erosion from the oxygen - rich circumbinary disk .",
    "the variations in the composition of the oxides with position in the outflow is rather unusual , given that virtually all sources showing resonances which have previously been identified with magnesium - iron - oxides or spinel , do not show any variation in peak position from source to source , or within sources @xcite .",
    "it is not trivial to connect these resonances to the ones currently observed in the red rectangle .",
    "further observations of the outflow in the low resolution mode of irs are required to gain further insights in the distribution and the carriers of the broad mir bands .",
