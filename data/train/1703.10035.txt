    "the point group symmetry around the impurity ta atom remained the same as around the original zr atom , but the number of non - equivalent positions increased .",
    "the calculated efg at the ta probe atom -8.4@xmath4710@xmath75 v / m@xmath48 is in excellent agreement with two mutually similar efg values from measured pac spectra ( 8.2 and 8.48@xmath4710@xmath75 v / m@xmath48 , corresponding to @xmath38(0)= 72.9 and 76 mrad / s , respectively ) .",
    "the fact that the corresponding calculated asymmetry parameter is zero , enables us to assign the 76 mrad / s component to zrni@xmath0 and thus definitely confirm the presence of this phase in our stoichiometric sample .",
