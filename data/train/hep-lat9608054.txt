    "projection @xmath23 is close to 1 , and , accordingly , @xmath16 dominates the action , i.e. , @xmath24 = @xmath25 within 9% .",
    "furthermore , we find that @xmath26 behaves more like a parameteter than a dynamical variable and factorizes in expectation values , e.g. , @xmath27 = @xmath28 and @xmath29 = @xmath30 within 0.2% and 3% , respectively .",
    "these results suggest that @xmath13 fields can be treated as beeing essentially random , and maqcd , the effective abelian theory after maximal abelian projection , is basically compact qed with effective coupling @xmath31 .",
    "a interesting feature of ma projection , named `` abelian dominance '' , is that abelian wilson loops @xmath32 reproduce the fundamental su(2 ) string tension  @xcite .",
    "abelian dominance is essentially an empirical observation .",
    "operationally , one may define abelian dominance ( ad ) as the property that large - scale properties of qcd are reproduced by operators @xmath33 , constructed exclusively from the abelian phases @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "we distinguish between two versions :    * : the operators @xmath33 are obtained by using ( after ma projection ) rescaled , diagonal links , @xmath34 $ ] , in the place of full su(2 ) links . * : a suitable _ ansatz _ must be devised for constructing the abelian operators .        for an @xmath35 wilson loop in the fundamental representation , @xmath36 = @xmath37 ,",

    "carrying out the free-@xmath13 intregration as remarked in sec .",
    "i , we find @xmath41 since the two expectation values differ by a perimeter ( @xmath42 ) term only , they generate the same string tension .",
    "thus , according to the weak version of abelian dominance , the abelian operator @xmath43 in this case should be the singly - charged abelian wilson loop , @xmath44 .        indeed , from fig .",
    "[ perc ] one sees that eq .",
    "( [ pol1 ] ) is a good approximation in ma projection and , not surprisingly , very bad in f12 projection .",
    "notice that @xmath45 can also be thought of as a fundamental - representation wilson loop constructed from rescaled , diagonal su(2 ) links @xmath46 = tr(@xmath47 $ ] ) .",
    "thus , with respect to ad for fundamental repr . sources    1 .",
    "the difference between @xmath26 @xmath48 1 and @xmath26 = 1 is not essential , i.e. , maqcd can be regarded as a `` diagonal su(2 ) '' theory .",
    "2 .   there is no distinction between weak and strong versions ; both are satisfied .",
    "abelian dominance for adjoint sources ( quarks ) requires that the adjoint `` string tension '' @xmath49 can be extracted from some abelian correlator @xmath50 . for the strong version of ad ,",
    "this operator is the adjoint wilson loop from diagonal su(2 ) links  @xcite @xmath51 as realized by greensite and coworkers  @xcite , the persistence of casimir scaling ( @xmath52 ) in mc simulations , and the associated failure to unambigously verify screening for the potential between adjoint sources ( @xcite and references therein ) presents a challenge for abelian dominance : if maqcd is a `` diagonal su(2 ) '' theory , there is no way for two @xmath53 ( neutral ) components of the adjoint source to interact via neutral `` photons '' , let alone form an abelian flux tube .",
    "one would therefore expect the adjoint string tension to vanish , rather than casimir scale .",
    "indeed , if maqcd is close to cqed , the doubly - charged abelian loop in eq .",
    "( [ strong ] ) is expected to have an area law falloff itself  @xcite and , therefore , for large loops @xmath54 , and the coresponding potential vanishes .",
    "this is verified numerically ( fig .",
    "[ test ] and  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the _ strong version of ad for adjoint sources fails _  @xcite . to see whether the weak version can be satisfied",
    "we decompose the full adjoint wilson loop @xmath55 into neutral ( @xmath56 ) and charged ( @xmath4 ) parts @xmath57 integrating over @xmath13 as before ( see  @xcite for details ) @xmath58 where @xmath59=@xmath60 , @xmath61=1@xmath62 .",
    "thus , without off - diagonal gluons ( @xmath26=1 ) @xmath63 , while with `` static '' off - diagonal gluons ( @xmath26 @xmath64 1 , but fixed ) one gets @xmath65 .",
    "however , although this greatly improves eq .",
    "( [ strong ] ) , as seen in fig .",
    "[ test ] , it is not enough for generating an area law for @xmath66 : off - diagonal gluons are required dynamically ( i.e. , @xmath18 can not be ignored ) . on the other hand ,",
    "for the operator @xmath67 one finds  @xcite @xmath68 this is the adjoint analog of eq .",
    "( [ pol1 ] ) ; it is seen  @xcite to be a very good approximation in ma projection ( only ) .",
    "a characteristic difference between @xmath69 and @xmath70 on one hand , and @xmath71 on the other , is that in the former case the free @xmath13-integration leads to expressions without @xmath72 terms , whereas in the latter such terms appear , with large degeneracy factors [ c.f .",
    "( [ exp_sq ] ) ] .",
    "since @xmath73 relies on ignoring @xmath74 terms , our approximations seem inconsistent in the case of @xmath66 , which may explain the failure of generating an area law for @xmath66 on the basis of these approximations . numerically ( 200 measurements on @xmath75 and 350 on @xmath20 lattices at @xmath21 ) we find that @xmath76 , @xmath66 and @xmath77 have within 10% same creutz ratios ( fig .",
    "[ test ] ) . this may be explained by using gauge invariance of the energy eigenstates in the spectral decomposition , suggesting that doubly - charged abelian wilson loops @xmath78 should be the relevant operators for testing _",
