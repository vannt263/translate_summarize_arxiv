    "determining whether properties of the ground or thermal state of a coupled quantum many - body system can be efficiently simulated on a computer is a central question in many - body physics .",
    "consider a spin lattice model that is unitarily equivalent to a lattice of uncoupled spins ; in such a model , the spectrum and the behaviour of simple correlation functions can be solved analytically .",
    "however , such simplicity can belie an underlying complexity , as the calculation of more general observables on the thermal state of this system can be computationally intractable .",
    "for example , one might want to simulate the outcomes of a sequence of local ( single - spin ) measurements on a subset of spins ; such measurements are used to reveal `` hidden '' order such as long - range entanglement  @xcite .",
    "although numerical techniques such as monte carlo methods  @xcite may be efficient in some instances , one can also devise models for which the outcomes of such measurements performs a quantum computation  @xcite for which no classical simulation algorithm is expected to be efficient .",
    "little is known about how to characterize the classical simulation complexity of such general observables , even in the simplest models .    here , we provide a remarkable example of a solvable model wherein the efficiency of simulating general observables of the thermal state undergoes a transition , separating the model s parameter space into two distinct regions .",
    "in one region , at high temperatures , we present an explicit algorithm that can efficiently simulate the outcome of any local adaptive measurement sequence . in the other region , we prove ( based on standard complexity assumptions ) that no such efficient simulation algorithm exists . remarkably , there is _ no _ phase transition in this model , classical or quantum , that could serve to demarcate these two regions .    specifically , we make use of the _ cluster state _ model of measurement - based quantum computation ( mbqc )  @xcite , wherein a fixed resource state is subjected to local measurements  @xcite .",
    "we consider a spin - lattice model for which the unperturbed ground state is a cluster state but which is subject to both thermal noise and a uniform external field .",
    "we introduce a method for efficient classical simulation of local measurements on sufficiently high - temperature equilibrium states of this model .",

    "the model we consider is the cluster state hamiltonian  @xcite with the addition of a local magnetic field in the @xmath0-direction .",
    "a cluster state is a highly entangled state of two - level systems on a lattice @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "it can be characterized as the unique @xmath2 eigenstate of a set of commuting operators @xmath3 , where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is the pauli @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) operator at site @xmath8 and where @xmath9 denotes that @xmath10 is connected to @xmath8 by a bond in the lattice @xmath1 .",
    "the cluster state hamiltonian  @xcite is a model of interacting spins with @xmath11 for which the cluster state is the unique ground state , and which possesses an energy gap of @xmath12 between the ground and first excited states .",
    "we will consider a modified hamiltonian with a local @xmath7 field at each site : @xmath13 for @xmath14 . with this parameterization , the ground state energy gap of the hamiltonian is @xmath12 for all values of @xmath15 .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 quantifies the relative strength of the local magnetic field term .",
    "for @xmath16 we recover the cluster state hamiltonian , while for @xmath17 the spins are uncoupled and the ground state is a product state .",
    "the thermal state of this model can be found straightforwardly for any strength of external field and temperature @xmath18 because the system is unitarily equivalent to a lattice of uncoupled spins  @xcite , as follows .",
    "the controlled - phase gate @xmath19 can be applied to any bond in the lattice ; because of its symmetry , it does not depend on which qubit is the control and which is the target .",
    "also , as the gate is diagonal in the @xmath7-basis , its action on different bonds all commute with each other .",
    "therefore , we can define the unitary @xmath20 which is given by the product of controlled - phase gates on all bonds of the lattice .",
    "this unitary operator decouples the system , as @xmath21 for all @xmath22 .",
    "we can therefore express the transformed hamiltonian as @xmath23 i.e. , as a sum over single spin observables .",
    "note that @xmath20 is a non - local unitary that creates entanglement , so that the ground state of @xmath24 can be highly entangled even though @xmath24 is unitarily equivalent to a model of uncoupled spins .",
    "note that this solution does not imply that mbqc can be efficiently simulated for any value of @xmath15 or @xmath18 , because the statistics of measurement outcomes may still be hard to calculate .",

    "the model is unitarily equivalent to uncoupled spins , and so there are no phase transitions , quantum or classical .",
    "specifically , in the thermodynamic limit , the free energy per site is analytic for the full range of @xmath18 and @xmath15 . despite this , we now demonstrate that this system exhibits a transition in its usefulness as a resource for universal mbqc .",
    "first , we demonstrate that above a certain finite temperature it is possible to efficiently classically simulate any attempt at mbqc .",
    "we label this region of the parameter space of the model ` region @xmath32 ' .",
    "second , we demonstrate that for @xmath15 and @xmath18 below some specific thresholds , the thermal state is a universal resource for mbqc ; this is denoted ` region @xmath33 ' .",

    "we conclude that it is not possible to perform mbqc on the states @xmath29 in the regime of temperature in which this simulation succeeds .",
    "the first step in our simulation algorithm is to represent the state @xmath29 as a _ projected entangled pair state _ ( peps )  @xcite ; a class of states that generalizes the well - known valence bond solids  @xcite . in a peps representation ,",
    "as indicated in figure  [ fig : pepspercolation](a ) for a square lattice , a set of @xmath40 virtual quantum systems ( we restrict ourselves to considering virtual qubits ) is associated with each site @xmath8 of the lattice , where @xmath40 is the number of bonds emanating from site @xmath8 .",
    "for every pair of sites @xmath8 and @xmath10 connected by a bond , we can identify two virtual qubits ( one at site @xmath8 and one at site @xmath10 ) which we associate to this bond .",

    ", the cluster state has a simple peps representation  @xcite corresponding to the choice of isometry @xmath46 at each site , with @xmath40 zeros ( ones ) in @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , and the states @xmath49 and @xmath50 forming a basis for the resulting qubit at each site .    in our simulation algorithm",
    ", we follow  @xcite and choose more general states for the pairs of virtual qubits on a bond , allowing us to describe thermal states of our cluster hamiltonian , both with and without the local field term .",
    "the zero - field thermal state @xmath51 is obtained as a peps if we choose @xmath52 on every bond , and @xmath53 at every site  @xcite . for @xmath54 ,",
    "the bond states are pure and maximally entangled , and the resulting peps is the cluster state . for @xmath55 ,",
    "the bond states are maximally mixed , corresponding to infinite temperature . to obtain @xmath51 ,",
    "the parameters @xmath56 are chosen such that @xmath57 where the product is taken over the bonds emanating from a particular site ; for simplicity , we choose all @xmath56 to be equal .",
    "the case of non - zero @xmath15 is handled by a slightly more general ansatz for the bond states , as follows @xmath58 the details of how to choose @xmath59 and @xmath60 to reproduce @xmath29 is described in appendix  [ sec : appb ] .",
    "the second step of the algorithm is to decompose the states @xmath41 as an ensemble of states , such that the elements of the ensemble are product states with high probability .",
    "every two - qubit state has a decomposition of the form  @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a pure entangled state , @xmath63 is a pure product state , @xmath64 , @xmath65 are probabilities , and the probability of getting a product state @xmath66 is maximal over all possible decompositions . following  @xcite , we find that for @xmath67 the state @xmath62 is simply the two - qubit cluster state , and that @xmath68 as expected , high temperatures yield small values for @xmath64 and an ensemble that is largely made up of product states . for the case of general @xmath15",
    "this decomposition is readily performed numerically .",
    "our key insight for simulating mbqc on a thermal peps state is that , armed with a decomposition such as eq .",
    "( [ eqn : bsa ] ) , one can efficiently generate instances of an ensemble that gives the state @xmath29 .",
    "if the temperature is sufficiently high , the members of this ensemble can be efficiently stored and manipulated in a classical computer .",
    "we outline the simulation algorithm here ; full details are given in appendix  [ app : sampling ] .    on a given run of the simulation",
    ", the state for each bond is chosen to be either the pure two - qubit entangled state @xmath62 or one of the product states @xmath69 ) , conditional on performing this measurement and successfully obtaining the outcome associated with @xmath70 .",
    "[ fig : pepspercolation ] illustrates this sampling . for sufficiently small @xmath64 ,",
    "percolation theory tells us that the lattice decomposes into disconnected clusters with entanglement only within a cluster , and not between clusters .",
    "specifically , if @xmath64 is smaller than the critical bond percolation probability @xmath71 for the lattice , then we expect all the clusters will be sufficiently small to store and simulate efficiently on a classical computer .",
    "we now provide an explicit bound on the classical computing resources required to execute our simulation algorithm .",
    "specifically , we prove that if @xmath72 , then the total simulation cost is bounded by a polynomial in @xmath34 .    in our simulation",
    ", each run yields a lattice with some entangled and some product - state bonds .",
    "we identify regions ",
    "`` clusters ''  that are connected by entangled bonds .",
    "distinct clusters are therefore in a product state , and can be stored and simulated separately . for cluster @xmath73 of size",
    "@xmath74 , a direct simulation would have a cost proportional to @xmath75 .",
    "because there are at most @xmath34 clusters , the total cost of classically simulating a measurement sequence on the state @xmath29 is bounded above by @xmath76 for each round of the simulation .",
    "we expect that for sufficiently high temperatures @xmath64 will become very small and the resulting clusters will be small enough to simulate efficiently . to confirm this expectation , we invoke results from percolation theory  @xcite to bound @xmath74 .",
    "the essential idea is that , if @xmath64 is smaller than the critical bond percolation probability @xmath71 for the lattice , then all the clusters will be `` small enough '' to simulate efficiently . specifically , if @xmath77 , then the mean cluster size @xmath78 does not depend on @xmath34 .",
    "in addition , the largest cluster size is almost surely of size @xmath79 with standard deviation @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "now imagine we reserve @xmath34 classical registers , each of @xmath81 classical bits for some constants @xmath82 and @xmath83 , and use each register to store the state of one of the @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) distinct clusters .",
    "this allows us to store , with @xmath82 bit precision , the quantum state of any cluster for which @xmath86 , and to simulate local measurements on it efficiently .",
    "as the largest cluster is almost surely of this size , the total simulation cost is bounded by a polynomial in @xmath34 .",
    "note that while this analysis shows efficient classical simulatability is possible , it is certainly not optimal  more precise estimates would require considering the distribution of cluster sizes .      with this analysis , we can now lower bound the critical temperature above which our simulation algorithm succeeds . in the case of @xmath16 , we can first compute the critical value of @xmath87 , and relate this to a critical temperature via @xmath88 for some well known lattices we find that @xmath89 is 0.813@xmath12 ( honeycomb ) , 1.6921@xmath12 ( square ) , 7.1617@xmath12 ( triangular ) , 13.1@xmath12 ( cubic ) . for @xmath90 , we resort to numerical methods ( see appendix  [ sec : appb ] ) and again find a critical temperature .",
    "as expected , this temperature becomes zero at @xmath91 , when the ground state is a product state .",

    "we note that improved lower bounds of this critical temperature can be obtained by allowing the value of @xmath56 to vary from bond to bond .",

    "the black dashed curve represents the separability criteria of  @xcite ; above this curve , the peps description of the thermal state is separable along any bipartite division of the cubic lattice given by a plane.,width=312 ]",
    "we now demonstrate that , for the ` cold and weak field ' region in parameter space , the thermal state of ( [ eq : clusterlocalz ] ) is a universal resource for mbqc on an appropriate lattice .",
    "specifically , we use the error thresholds of  @xcite , together with a local filtering method , to prove the existence of a finite region of parameter space for which the thermal state of ( [ eq : clusterlocalz ] ) is a universal resource for mbqc given ideal single - qubit measurements .",

    "for @xmath108 the measurement disentangles the qubits in @xmath107 from the rest of the cluster state , leaving them in the state @xmath49 .",
    "we then randomly flip each qubit in @xmath107 , such that they are described by the completely mixed state .",
    "we also apply a @xmath7 gate to all neighbouring qubits to those that have been flipped into the state @xmath50 .",
    "the effect of this further processing is to prepare a @xmath16 thermal cluster state for which complete dephasing has been applied qubits in @xmath107 .",
    "we then discard the measurement record and the result is a thermal cluster state on the entire lattice @xmath1 for which each qubit has been passed through an effective dephasing channel @xmath109 , with @xmath110 .",
    "this is just the same state as the @xmath16 thermal state with @xmath18 chosen such that @xmath111 .",
    "thus , a thermal @xmath112 state can be converted by local measurements into an ideal cluster state subjected to dephasing noise . with this fact",
    ", we use the results of  @xcite , which demonstrate that mbqc can proceed using the cluster state on a body - centred cubic ( bcc ) lattice with dephasing noise up to @xmath113 .",
    "this bound defines a region at low @xmath18 and @xmath15 wherein every state is useful for mbqc given ideal measurements .",

    ".    however , these results may be too conservative .",
    "consider the @xmath112 ground state , and apply the local filtering measurement .",
    "again , the effect of this measurement is to disentangle some qubits from the lattice , and leave the remaining qubits in a cluster state .",
    "one can then investigate whether the resulting subset @xmath102 contains a cluster of neighbouring sites that spans the lattice @xmath1 .",
    "this will occur with certainty if the success probability @xmath115 is above the site percolation threshold , @xmath116 .",
    "so if @xmath117 , then the resulting cluster state on @xmath102 is a universal resource for mbqc  @xcite .",
    "this lower bound ( valid only at @xmath96 ) is much larger than the conservative lower bound on the critical value of @xmath15 obtained via the dephasing argument above .",
    "a similar question can be asked of the thermal cluster state ; however , the results of  @xcite do not directly apply because it is not clear how to convert the thermal cluster state on the irregular set @xmath102 into the bcc lattice for which error thresholds are known .",
    "( a direct conversion using the methods of  @xcite would require performing local @xmath6 measurements , which do not commute with the noise . ) as a result it is not clear that mbqc can in fact be performed .",
    "nevertheless , fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] shows the region q for which the success probability of the filtering operation is greater than the site percolation threshold @xmath117 , with a resulting temperature @xmath118 less than the critical temperature for universal mbqc .",
    "an alternative approach would be to apply the error correction procedure of  @xcite which corrects the effects of both finite temperature and qubit loss errors .",
    "the performance of this scheme in a three dimensional cluster is currently unknown , however it may yield better performance than the strategies described above in some regions of parameter space .",
    "we have shown that the thermal equilibrium states of eq .",
    "( [ eq : clusterlocalz ] ) undergo a transition in their usefulness for mbqc , from a region of parameter space where every state is a universal resource , to one where every state is efficiently classically simulatable . in spite of this dramatic change in computational power , these states do not exhibit any corresponding phase transition .",
    "we conclude by contrasting our results with some related work .",
    "first , in a similar model with a transverse rather than longitudinal local field , the system _ does _ exhibit a zero - temperature phase transition at sufficiently high field strength , and correlation functions can be identified which characterize a phase for which a set of mbqc gates can be performed over arbitrary ranges  @xcite .",
    "thus , a transition in computational power coincides with a quantum phase transition in this model .",
    "second , non - analytic behaviour in long - range entanglement quantities such as localizable entanglement  @xcite does not necessarily indicate a phase transition . in our model , for @xmath119 , the localizable entanglement in the ground state",
    "is precisely equal to 1 ebit at all length scales , and at @xmath17 it is equal to zero ( because the state is a product state ) .",
    "there is no analytic function fulfilling these requirements , and so the localizable entanglement is a non - analytic function of @xmath15 , indicating a sharp transition somewhere in the interval @xmath120 .",
    "again , we emphasize that there is no quantum phase transition at any value of @xmath15 in this model , and so we have an example of a system where a non - analyticity in the localizable entanglement length does _ not _ identify an underlying quantum phase transition .",
    "this in contrast to the situation for a large number of models discussed in the literature  @xcite including the cluster hamiltonian with a local @xmath6 field  @xcite .",
