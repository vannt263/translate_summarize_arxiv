    "in the simple example of low energy effective field theory for nucleon - nucleon scattering it was demonstrated that the cut - off theory can reproduce the scattering amplitude calculated using subtractively renormalised ( using off mass - shell subtractions ) theory up to the order of accuracy of the considered approximation , the difference between two amplitudes being of higher order ( in small expansion parameter ) .",
    "this simple example serves as a demonstration of some more general considerations about cut - off field theories formulated below .",
    "using chiral power counting originally developed by weinberg one can find the potential up to any desired order . then to remove divergences one can impose cut - off regularization .",
    "the cut - off regularization destroys chiral and gauge symmetries and to restore them it is necessary to include additional terms into the lagrangian ( and consequently into the potential ) . cut - off dependence of the physical quantities can be removed systematically by including additional terms in the lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the power - law divergences , which caused higher order operators to be involved in the renormalization of the diagrams obtained by iterating the low order potential , now emerge as powers of the cut - off parameter .",
    "as far as cut - off should be taken of the order of masses of particles which were integrated out , it should be clear that cut - off regularization does not respect power counting and it seems that imposing this regularization will destroy the whole machinery . ( the problem can not be solved by imposing a small cut - off as cut - off regularized",
    "integrals contain inverse powers of cut - off parameters as well ) .",
    "however the large factors which seem to threaten power counting can be absorbed by redefining the couplings already included into the potential @xcite .",
    "fitting the parameters of the cut - off theory one can reproduce the results of the subtractively renormalised theory up to the order of accuracy determined by approximation made in the potential .",
    "the results of cut - off theory are as reliable as the ones of subtractively renormalised theory , the error being of the order of terms neglected in the potential .",
    "as far as the cut - off is of the order of the mass of lightest particle which was integrated out the higher order ( in momenta ) cut - off dependent corrections are suppressed by powers of this parameter . by increasing the cut - off parameter one could make the mentioned corrections smaller but for large cut - off it would be problematic to include the positive powers of the cut - off parameter in to a redefinition of the coupling constants .",
    "so , the equivalence between subtractively renormalized and cut - off theories can be achieved only for the cut - off of the order of the mass of lightest particle which was integrated out .",
    "the results of two approaches are expected to deviate significantly beyond the range of validity of the power counting .",
    "although the difference between two expressions is of higher order it becomes large for the momenta for which the power counting breaks down in subtractively renormalised theory .",
    "the range of validity of power counting depends on normalisation condition .",
    "hence the range of the equivalence i.e. the range of the momenta for which the difference between results of two approaches is small is determined by the choice of normalisation condition in subtractively renormalised theory as well as by the choice of the value of cut - off parameter in cut - off theory .",
    "choosing optimal conditions one can claim that two approaches lead to equivalent results for the range of the momenta ( energy ) for which the power counting is at work .",
    "one should conclude that the doubts about consistency and systematic character of cut - off theories @xcite are ungrounded .",
    "so the reasonable success of the cut - off chiral perturbation theory originally started with work @xcite should not be a surprise . although the cut - off theory is technically a little complicated it has a great advantage in that one can determine amplitudes from equations .",
    "note that there are no self - contained equations for subtractively renormalised amplitudes in these non - renormalizable ( in the traditional sense ) effective field theories and one instead has to sum up renormalised diagrams .",
