    "present day chemical synthesis methods allow for the creation of colloidal particles of various sizes , types , and shapes @xcite .",
    "the behavior of these tailored particles in suspensions mimics that of atoms at favorable length and time scales , thus providing model systems for testing basic theoretical concepts , which even permit direct visualizations of thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "in addition colloidal particles offer very rich perspectives for potential application , e.g. , in the context of optically active materials @xcite .",
    "colloidal particles of intermediate wettability usually adsorb at fluid - fluid interfaces .",
    "this configuration is extremely stable against thermal fluctuations due to the very large free energy of adsorption for micron - size particles .",
    "this can be used , for example , to stabilize emulsions @xcite .",
    "such effectively two - dimensional colloidal systems have also been used to successfully test @xcite the kosterlitz - thouless  @xcite scenario for 2d - melting , which is very difficult to capture in atomic systems .",
    "the presence of an interface affects effective interactions between colloidal particles considerably as compared to those for colloids in bulk solution .",
    "examples for these interface induced effective interactions include capillary forces or effective dipole - dipole repulsive forces at water - air interfaces  @xcite .",
    "whereas the gravity induced former ones do not play a role for colloids with a size below a micron , the latter ones explain the emergence of 2d - crystal structures  @xcite for laterally confined systems . however , there are experimental evidences  @xcite supporting the occurrence of attractive forces between equally charged particles at interfaces , with a range exceeding by far the range of van der waals attraction .",
    "the observed attraction was originally attributed to flotation - like capillary forces decaying proportional to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the distance between the particles @xcite . however",
    ", this explanation was found to be unsatisfactory  @xcite , because for a mechanically isolated system , composed of the particles and the interface , one rather obtains an attractive behavior @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the effective capillary attraction can not overcome the direct dipole - dipole repulsion @xmath4 , unless the screening length in water is comparable with the size of the particles . in this case",
    "a total effective interaction potential exhibits a shallow minimum with a depth of several @xmath5  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been suggested that the finite curvature and the pinning of the interface might be important for generating a long - ranged attraction @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , in the experiment reported in ref .",
    "@xcite the particles were trapped at the surface of a droplet pinned to a solid plate , but this aspect was neglected in the theoretical analysis put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown  @xcite that finite curvature and pinning indeed have profound effects on the trapping potential of a colloid as compared to the case of a flat and unbounded interface .",
    "in addition , general expressions have been obtained for the free energy of the system in the case of an arbitrary external pressure field acting on the droplet surface . in the present analysis",
    "we use those results in order to calculate the effective pair potential for particles subjected to external radial forces ( see fig .",

    "these particles are subjected to radial external forces @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , where @xmath11 is the unit vector normal to the spherical cap - like surface of the droplet in the reference configuration . in ref .  @xcite it has been shown that under these conditions the particles can be well approximated by capillary monopoles , which in turn are determined exclusively by the external forces .",
    "this implies that the sizes of the particles and the contact angles at their surfaces are irrelevant .",
    "the dashed lines on the surface of the cap of the sphere with origin @xmath12 and radius @xmath13 are the points with spherical coordinates @xmath14 , @xmath15 , with @xmath16 fixed .",

    "two curves meet : one is the intersection of the plane @xmath22 through the origin @xmath12 with the spherical cap ( dashed line ) , the other is the intersection of the spherical cap with the plane through @xmath12 spanned by @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( long red arrow ) ; @xmath20 is the angle formed by the vectors tangential to these two curves .",
    "[ fig : system_sketch ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    we consider @xmath23 spherical particles floating at the surface of a sessile , non - volatile droplet , the surface of which meets the planar substrate at a contact angle @xmath0 . with no external forces acting on the particles",
    "the shape of the droplet remains that of an undeformed spherical cap of radius @xmath13 and the immersions of the particles into the liquid forming the droplet are determined by the contact angles at each of the particle surfaces  @xcite .",
    "( due to the partial immersion of the colloidal particles and the volume constraint of the liquid , the radius @xmath13 of the spherical cap with colloids is larger than that of the corresponding droplet without colloids . )",
    "we call this the reference configuration .",
    "we place the origin of the reference system at the geometrical center of a sphere formed by completing the unperturbed droplet shape to a full sphere , and choose the outward normal of the exposed substrate surface as the positive @xmath24direction .",
    "we parametrize the positions of the particles by the radial distances @xmath25 and by the solid angles @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the solid angle used to parameterize the droplet surface ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : system_sketch ] ) . in the reference configuration",
    "the particles float freely at the surface of the droplet , because in this case there is no preferred angular configuration of the particles . in the presence of radial external forces @xmath28 ( e.g. , generated by optical tweezers ) acting on each of the particles the droplet deforms such that those forces are balanced by the radial components of the corresponding capillary forces . however , the tangential capillary forces acting on the particles are in general unbalanced which leads to effective interactions between the particles . in terms of the free energy",
    "this means that in this case the total free energy depends on the angular configuration of the particles .",
    "previously it has been shown  @xcite that the influence of a single colloidal particle on the surface of a sessile droplet can be described in terms of a capillary monopole determined by the external radial force acting on the particle .",
    "the results of this approximate , linearized theory agree very well with the corresponding results of the numerical minimization of the full , non - gaussian surface free energy . therefore in the following we describe the particles in terms of capillary monopoles , so that the particle sizes and contact angles at their surfaces remain intrinsic parameters which do not enter the analysis explicitly .",
    "accordingly , we study the droplet under the action of radial external pointlike forces of magnitudes @xmath29 giving rise to an external pressure @xmath30 with @xmath31 as dirac s angular delta function .",
    "we consider the case that the deformations @xmath32 of the droplet surface @xmath33 due to the external pressure @xmath34 are small .",
    "for this to hold , the condition  @xcite @xmath35 , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the tension of the droplet surface , might not be sufficient , because the forces on individual particles , even if they are small , might add up to a large total external force ( and thus might lead to a large deformation ) ; therefore we impose the more stringent condition @xmath38 .",
    "if this condition holds , @xmath39 can be regarded as a small parameter .",
    "( in the one - particle case this reduces to @xmath40 as introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand one has to keep in mind that the forces @xmath29 can not be stronger than the maximal capillary forces , which lead to the extraction of the individual particles from the surface , and which are of the order of @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the characteristic size of the particle @xmath43 .",
    "the resulting shape of the droplet can be determined by minimizing a free energy functional under the constraint of a fixed liquid volume , which leads to the young - laplace equation relating the curvature of the droplet surface to the pressure difference across the interface  @xcite .",
    "this equation depends also on the mechanism fixing the lateral position of the droplet at the substrate . in the following",
    "we shall use the subscript @xmath44 in order to distinguish between the cases of a free contact line with a fixed center of mass ( @xmath45 ) and of a pinned contact line with a free center of mass ( @xmath46 ; in this case the center of mass can be free because the balance of forces is already guaranteed by the pinning of the contact line ) .",
