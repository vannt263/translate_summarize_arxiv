    "the achievement of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in a trapped gas of @xmath1cr atoms by the stuttgart group @xcite is the first instance of a condensate with large dipole - dipole interactions . in comparison to alkali atoms , which have a maximum magnetic dipole moment of @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the bohr magneton )",
    ", chromium atoms possess an anomalously large magnetic dipole moment of @xmath4 .",
    "the long - range part of the interaction between two dipoles separated by @xmath5 , and aligned by an external field along a unit vector @xmath6 ( in this paper we shall always assume the dipoles are aligned by an external field ) , is given by @xmath7 where the coupling @xmath8 depends on the square of the dipole moment .",
    "chromium atoms also have shorter range isotropic interactions which are asymptotically of the van der waals - type and so fall off as @xmath9 . at ultra - low temperatures",
    "the de broglie wavelength of the atoms is much larger than the range of the isotropic interactions which can consequently be handled within perturbation theory by using the usual delta - function pseudo - potential @xcite @xmath10 characterized solely by the @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath11 .",
    "a measure of the strength of the long - range dipole - dipole interaction relative to the s - wave scattering energy is given by the dimensionless quantity @xmath12 for @xmath13rb one finds @xmath14 , and na has @xmath15 . taking the @xmath0-wave scattering length of @xmath1cr to be @xmath16 @xcite , one obtains @xmath17 . in a further significant development ,",
    "the stuttgart group has also studied feshbach scattering resonances between @xmath1cr atoms @xcite .",
    "this means that the magnitude and sign of @xmath11 , and thus also the value of @xmath18 , can be controlled .",
    "the principal effect of the anisotropy of the dipole - dipole interactions upon a stationary , trapped , condensate will be to distort its aspect ratio so that it is elongated along the direction of the external field @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of purely isotropic interactions , for which the aspect ratio of the condensate matches that of the trap . by adopting an elongated aspect ratio along the direction of polarization ,",
    "the condensate achieves a lower energy by placing more dipoles end - to - end in which configuration they are attractive , and reducing the number of repulsive side - by - side interactions .",
    "when @xmath18 exceeds a certain value , which in general depends on the aspect ratio the trap as well as the total number of atoms @xmath19 , mean - field theory predicts that the condensate becomes unstable to collapse @xcite .",
    "the partially attractive nature of the dipole - dipole interaction is also responsible for introducing a curious ` roton ' minimum @xcite into the bogoliubov excitation spectrum of a uniform dipolar bec , reminiscent of that found in the excitation spectrum of liquid helium ii .",
    "it is possible that this roton minimum is indicative of an instability towards the formation of a density wave @xcite .",
    "the fact that the interaction between dipoles aligned by an external field along the axis of symmetry of a cylindrical trap are on average repulsive in an oblate ( pancake shaped ) bec , but , conversely , are on average attractive in a prolate ( cigar shaped ) bec , means that the sign of the dipolar mean - field energy can be controlled via the aspect ratio of the trap . in this paper",
    "we are interested in calculating the effect that this change of aspect ratio of the trap has upon the vortex state in a trapped dipolar bec .",
    "the case of a vortex in a trapped bec with repulsive short - range interactions , as described by eq.([eq : deltafninteraction ] ) with @xmath20 , has been extensively studied both theoretically , e.g.  @xcite , and experimentally , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "attractive short - range interactions have , on the other hand , received comparatively less attention , although a rotating bec with attractive interactions is of considerable fundamental interest @xcite .",
    "in particular , when the interactions are attractive it is intuitively plausible that vortex formation will be suppressed because it is energetically expensive to form the vortex core since this requires moving atoms from the centre of the bec where they interact with many other atoms and placing them on the edges where the interact with fewer @xcite .",
    "instead , it has been proposed that the angular momentum might be preferentially absorbed into other types of excitation , such as centre of mass motion or shape oscillations , which cause much less disturbance to the condensate density profile and internal correlations @xcite .",
    "we also note that a recent theoretical study of a two - dimensional bec with purely attractive short - range interactions found a new class of vortices in the form of bright ring solitons @xcite .",
    "when it comes to dipolar interactions , which are partly attractive , partly repulsive , one might therefore anticipate rotational properties similar to those of standard becs with either attractive or repulsive interactions , depending upon whether the dipolar bec is prolate or oblate , respectively .",
    "the latest experiments on chromium @xcite have detected the first evidence of dipolar interactions upon the dynamics of a bec by observing the ballistic expansion of the bec when the trap is switched off .",
    "the results are in good agreement with theoretical predictions @xcite giving us some confidence in the theory of dipolar becs which has been built up over the last six years . in the following",
    "we will discuss a vortex in a rotating dipolar bec in the thomas - fermi ( hydrodynamic ) regime , which is defined as being when the quantum zero - point kinetic energy due to the confinement by the trap is negligible in comparison to the trapping and interaction energies .",
    "this is the relevant regime when there are a large number of atoms .",
    "we shall make extensive use of the exact results for dipolar becs in the thomas - fermi limit reported in references @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the key insight of those papers was that the dipolar mean - field potential that the atomic dipoles feel , and which is non - local , i.e. depends on the entire atom distribution , can be expressed in terms of derivatives of a scalar potential that is a solution of the poisson equation with the dipolar density as a source .",
    "in other words , this scalar potential is formally equivalent to the electrostatic potential one would get if the density distribution were not one of dipoles but of charges , and thus standard mathematical techniques known from electrostatics can be applied .",
    "three recent theory papers @xcite have dealt with the structure of vortex lattices in dipolar becs , but our aim here is to investigate the differences between dipolar and non - dipolar condensates in the case of a single vortex",
    ". our main concern will be the calculation of the critical rotation frequency @xmath21 necessary to make a single vortex energetically favorable over the ground state .",
    "note that reference @xcite also deals with the single vortex case , but their focus was somewhat different .",
    "one of their principle results was that in the case of dipolar interactions plus _ attractive _ contact interactions ( negative scattering length ) the vortices develop a ` craterlike ' structure which is probably connected with the density wave instability mentioned above . we shall come back to this point in section [ sec : energyfunctional ] , however we shall not explicitly consider negative scattering lengths here because we wish to use some exact results that only hold in the thomas - fermi limit .",
    "a dipolar bec with attractive short - range interactions is unstable to collapse in the thomas - fermi limit and so we limit ourselves to @xmath20 .",
    "consider a condensate at @xmath22 with a wave function @xmath23 normalized to the total number of atoms @xmath24 .",
    "the general form of @xmath23 when there is one singly quantized vortex present can be expressed in cylindrical coordinates @xmath25 as @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "this state carries an angular momentum @xmath27 . in",
    "a frame rotating at angular velocity @xmath28 about the z - axis the energy of the condensate becomes @xmath29 , where the angular momentum @xmath30 and energy @xmath31 are those pertaining to the laboratory frame .",
    "however , creating a vortex costs energy . denoting the energy of the bec in its ground state without any vortex ( @xmath32 ) by @xmath33 and the extra energy needed to make a single vortex by @xmath34",
    ", we can write the energy of the vortex state in the rotating frame as @xmath35 thus we see that for a bec at equilibrium in a trap rotating at angular velocity @xmath28 the vortex state becomes energetically favorable when @xmath28 exceeds a critical rotational velocity @xmath36 to obtain @xmath21 we thus need to evaluate the extra energy associated with the formation of the vortex . the total energy functional for a trapped dipolar bec can be written as @xmath37 where , in terms of the condensate wave function @xmath23 , @xmath38 is the kinetic energy , and @xmath39 \\label{eq : trapdefn}\\ ] ] is the energy due to the harmonic trap @xmath40 $ ] , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the ratio of the trap frequencies .",
    "note that in this paper we shall assume that both the trap and the condensate are cylindrically symmetric about the @xmath43 direction , so in particular @xmath44 , and the external field responsible for aligning the dipoles is along the @xmath43 axis .",
    "the total mean - field interaction energy can to a good approximation @xcite be written as the sum of two parts .",
    "the first is due to the isotropic short - range interactions which give rise to pure s - wave scattering @xmath45 and the second is due to dipole - dipole interactions @xmath46 the long - range and anisotropic nature of the dipole - dipole interaction , @xmath47 , makes the calculation of @xmath48 a non - trivial exercise .",
    "however , in the thomas - fermi regime some exact results ( within mean - field theory ) are available .",
    "in particular , an exact solution of the vortex - free thomas - fermi problem for a dipolar bec in a harmonic trap yields a density profile which is an inverted parabola @xcite .",
    "this solution is similar to the familiar non - dipolar case @xcite , except that the aspect ratio of the cloud in the dipolar case is no longer identical to that of the trap but is stretched along the direction of the polarizing field , as mentioned above . by applying scaling transformations to this exact solution one can also describe the lowest energy collective excitations of the condensate @xcite , as well as the expansion dynamics when the trap is turned off . in the thomas - fermi regime",
    "the critical ratio of the dipolar and @xmath0-wave interactions above which instabilities occur is @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of these instabilities is indicated by the appearance of imaginary frequencies for the collective excitations .",
    "another particularly novel instability in a trapped dipolar bec , which originates from the long - range nature of the interatomic interactions , is the appearance of a local minimum in the mean - field potential _ outside _ the condensate when @xmath50 .",
    "this stimulates the formation of a ` saturn - ring ' around the condensate as atoms tunnel into the minimum @xcite .    as explained at length in references @xcite and @xcite , the dipole - dipole interaction can be re - expressed so as to take advantage of the large technical machinery that exists to deal with electrostatic interactions . in general one can write @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the non - local dipolar mean - field potential @xmath53 for dipoles aligned along @xmath43 this dipolar mean - field potential can in turn be expressed in terms of a fictious electrostatic potential @xmath54 @xmath55 which is obtained from the `` charge '' distribution @xmath56 in the usual way @xmath57 where , of course , @xmath56 and @xmath54 satisfy poisson s equation @xmath58 .",
    "this formulation of the problem allows us to immediately identify some generic features of dipolar gases .",
    "for example , if @xmath56 and hence @xmath54 are uniform along the polarization direction ( @xmath43 ) then the non - local part of the dipolar interaction vanishes because of the @xmath59 operator . a very prolate pencil - like condensate , i.e. one which has @xmath60 will therefore be largely unaffected by the non - local part of the interaction except perhaps at the very ends of the condensate if the density profile has a large curvature there .",
    "thus , in the very prolate ( or entirely homogenous ) case the contribution of dipolar interactions to the mean - field potential reduces to that of the local term @xmath61 whose effect is then simply to modify the magnitude of the local mean - field potential arising from the pure @xmath0-wave interactions . a related example to",
    "a very prolate bec is a bec with a generic smooth outer density profile but which is , however , penetrated by a pencil - like vortex or vortices : the dipolar potential would be expected to peak around the ends of each vortex where the density profile is rapidly changing in the @xmath62-direction .",
    "one might conjecture that the curious ` craterlike ' density profile around the ends of vortices in dipolar becs that has recently been seen in simulations @xcite is connected to this effect .",
    "let us consider the case of a parabolic density profile of the form @xmath63 as stated above , a parabolic density profile is an exact solution of the hydrodynamic equations for a non - rotating bec in the thomas - fermi limit even in the presence of dipolar interactions . here",
    "the subscript `` bg '' stands for `` background '' , i.e. for a condensate without a vortex but on top of which we will superimpose a vortex later on .",
    "one finds that the dipolar mean - field potential inside a condensate with the parabolic density profile ( [ eq : nbg ] ) is given by @xcite @xmath64 .",

    "the function @xmath73 upon which @xmath74 depends is itself dependent upon whether the condensate density profile is prolate , in which case @xmath75 or oblate @xmath76 the value of the aspect ratio @xmath66 is given by the solution of a transcendental equation @xcite @xmath77 + \\left ( \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{dd}}-1 \\right ) \\left(\\kappa^{2}-\\gamma^{2}\\right )   = 0 .",
    "\\label{eq : transcendental}\\ ] ] note that according to eq .",
    "( [ phiddinside ] ) , the dipolar mean - field potential @xmath78 is in general saddle - shaped @xcite , and thus inherits the anisotropic partially attractive / partially repulsive character of the dipolar interactions .",
    "the saddle shaped mean - field potential causes an elongation of the bec along the polarization direction which can be viewed as type of magnetostriction .",
    "this is illustrated for five different trap aspect ratios in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappaall ] . the total energy ( @xmath79 ) associated with the vortex - free thomas - fermi solution ( [ eq : nbg ] ) can be calculated to be @xcite @xmath80 .",

    "having now summarized what is already known concerning the mean - field potential inside a non - rotating dipolar bec , let us turn to the form of the density profile of a rotating bec with a vortex .",
    "we shall adopt the following variational ansatz for the density profile of an @xmath19-atom condensate with a single vortex @xmath81 where we have observed that the ansatz can be written as the sum of two terms : the background thomas - fermi parabolic profile @xmath82 as already given in equation ( [ eq : nbg ] ) and the vortex profile @xmath83 @xmath84 ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) assumes that the vortex , whose core size is parameterized by @xmath85 , is superimposed on a background parabolic density profile with radii @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "note that the variational ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) has the correct @xmath88 dependence of the density as @xmath89 ( with @xmath90 ) , which it must have in order to satisfy the gross - pitaevskii equation for a vortex of @xmath91 circulation quanta @xcite .",
    "it has also got the correct asymptotic form ( in terms of even powers of @xmath92 ) that the solution must have for @xmath93 .",
    "the central density @xmath94 is fixed by normalization to be @xmath95 \\bigg )   \\label{eq : centraldensity}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 is the ratio of the vortex core size to the transverse radius of the bec .",
    "we proceed by minimizing @xmath97 as a function of the three variational parameters @xmath98 , @xmath87 and @xmath85 .",
    "the terms @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 can all be calculated analytically in a straightforward albeit laborious manner .",
    "the results are presented in appendix a. to evaluate the dipole - dipole energy functional we begin from equation ( [ eq : edd1 ] ) and substitute in the density ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz2 ] ) @xmath102 noting that the two cross terms between the vortex and background densities are identical , i.e.  the integral is invariant under exchange of the coordinates @xmath5 and @xmath103 , the dipolar energy functional can be written @xmath104 we shall now restrict ourselves to situations where the size of the vortex core is much smaller than the radius of the condensate , i.e.  @xmath105 .",
    "this is consistent with the spirit of the thomas - fermi approximation for the background parabolic envelope , and should hold for condensates containing a large number of atoms , providing the system does not become very prolate .",
    "to this end we shall drop the vortex - vortex part of the dipolar energy functional since this has an extra factor of @xmath106 in comparison to the cross term .",
    "the remaining two terms can be expressed as @xmath107 the first term is just the dipolar energy of the condensate without a vortex , whilst the second gives the dipolar ` interaction ' between the vortex and the background density profile .",
    "both terms have been reduced to single integrals of their respective density profiles over the known quadratic function @xmath108 , as given by equation ( [ phiddinside ] ) , which is the mean - field potential due to the background inverted parabola density profile .",
    "these integrals can therefore be evaluated relatively easily and the results are given in the appendix .",
    "to illustrate the oblate case we shall consider 150,000 @xmath1cr atoms in a trap having frequencies @xmath109 rad / s , @xmath110 rad / s , so that @xmath111 .",
    "the harmonic oscillator length of the trap along the x - direction is then @xmath112 m . we numerically minimize the total energy functional @xmath97 with respect to \\{@xmath85 , @xmath113 , @xmath66 } using the _ mathematica _ routine _ nminimize_. in order to bring out the dependence of the various quantities upon the relative strength of the two types of interactions ( @xmath0-wave and dipolar ) we plot the results as a function of the @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath11 , since this quantity can be controlled in an experiment @xcite . as @xmath114",
    "the dipolar interactions dominate , whereas when @xmath115 the dipolar interactions become insignificant .",
    "the magnitude of the magnetic dipole interaction is here assumed to be fixed at the appropriate value for @xmath1cr , namely @xmath116 .",
    "note that in the case of dipoles induced by electric fields one has @xmath117 @xcite , where @xmath118 is the polarizability and @xmath31 is the electric field strength , so the size of the electric dipolar interaction can be directly controlled via the magnitude of @xmath31 .",
    "in fact the magnitude of even magnetic dipolar interactions can be controlled independently of the @xmath0-wave interactions by rotating the magnetic field @xcite , but we presume that the experimentally easiest option is to use a feshbach resonance to adjust @xmath119 since only the magnitude of the magnetic field needs to be tuned .    in all the calculations depicted in the following figures we limited the minimum value of the scattering length to be @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the bohr radius , corresponding to @xmath122 .",
    "this is because as @xmath114 the approximation we made in the calculation of the energy functional that @xmath123 be small begins to breakdown ( see figures [ fig : betapic1 ] and [ fig : betapic1pro ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in the thomas - fermi approximation used here collapse instabilities can occur when @xmath124 .",
    "indeed , as mentioned previously , because of these collapse instabilities one can argue that the thomas - fermi regime does not exist when @xmath124 , see @xcite .",

    "we now turn to the case of a prolate trap for which the dipolar interactions are predominantly attractive .",

    "the effect that @xmath21 is decreased in an oblate trap and increased in a prolate trap is the main result of this paper .",
    "let us see if we can interpret this physically .",
    "the value of @xmath21 shown in figures [ fig : omegacrit ] and [ fig : omegacritpro ] for the purely @xmath0-wave interactions ( dashed curve ) agrees very well with the analytic formula valid in the thomas - fermi limit @xcite @xmath132 this is derived by integrating the kinetic energy density @xmath133 , arising from the superfluid flow @xmath134 around the vortex , over the profile of the condensate .",
    "the lower limit of the integral is set by the vortex core size which is given by the healing length @xmath135 @xmath136 the relevant density appearing in this expression is taken to be the density at the centre of the trap @xmath94 in the absence of a vortex , which in the thomas - fermi limit is given by @xmath137 in the thomas - fermi regime the radii of a condensate with @xmath0-wave interactions obey @xcite @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "combining all these quantities together one finds that as @xmath114 the critical rotation frequency diverges as @xmath141 , although , of course , eventually the neglected quantum pressure term will prevent this divergence .",
    "now consider the dipolar case .",
    "a formula for @xmath21 closely resembling ( [ eq : lundhsol ] ) should still apply . indeed , the inverted - parabola thomas - fermi density profile is common to both the @xmath0-wave and dipolar cases and it is this that gives rise to the specific 5/2 and 0.67 numerical factors appearing in ( [ eq : lundhsol ] ) .",
    "the one difference we might expect concerns the lower limit of the integration which is set by the vortex core size . in the presence of dipolar interactions we can no longer assert that the core size is solely determined by @xmath135 since this makes no reference to dipolar interactions .",
    "indeed , we might expect that as the scattering length vanishes it is replaced by an equivalent length scale set by the dipolar interactions of the form @xmath142 .",
    "however , expression ( [ eq : lundhsol ] ) only has logarithmic accuracy @xcite and is relatively insensitive to the lower cutoff @xmath135 of the kinetic energy integral appearing inside the logarithm . the dominant change in ( [ eq : lundhsol ] ) due to the presence of dipolar interactions is therefore likely to be in the radial size @xmath98 .",
    "this makes one wonder whether the same expression ( [ eq : lundhsol ] ) for @xmath21 approximately holds for dipolar becs if the radius @xmath98 is modified to include the effect of the dipole - dipole interactions but the changes in the healing length are ignored ?",
    "the answer to this question is yes @xcite as we shall now show .",
    "the thomas - fermi radii of a vortex - free bec cylindrically symmetric in the @xmath143 plane ( dipoles aligned along @xmath62 ) with both contact and dipolar interactions are @xcite @xmath144^{1/5 } \\label{eq : rxsol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath145",

    "( [ fig : santosapprox ] ) we compare the value of @xmath21 calculated by the energy minimization method presented in section [ sec : results ] with the value of @xmath21 obtained from the explicit expression ( [ eq : lundhsol ] ) where @xmath98 is given by ( [ eq : rxsol ] ) .",
    "the agreement is strikingly good , with the exception of very small @xmath119 in the prolate case .",
    "in fact , in view of the closeness of the match one is tempted to conclude that whilst the long - range dipolar interactions strongly influence the boundary of the condensate and hence the large scales represented by @xmath98 , the shorter range van der waals interactions which set the scale for @xmath119 and hence @xmath135 continue to dominate the shorter range physics setting the size of the vortex core , except when @xmath119 becomes very small indeed .",
    "we have seen in previous sections that for a dipolar bec in a rotating prolate trap , the formation of a vortex is increasingly energetically suppressed as the dipolar interactions grow in strength .",
    "indeed , once @xmath146 the vortex would be impossible to realize , in a harmonic trap at least , because the trap can no longer counteract the centrifugal force and the bec would fly apart ( neglecting , of course , the intriguing possibility that the attractive nature of the mean - field interactions might be capable of holding the condensate together for rotational frequencies @xmath28 greater than @xmath147 ) .",
    "the question then arises , how does a prolate dipolar bec rotate ?",
    "one possibility is for the condensate to generate other types of excitation that carry angular momentum , such as quadrupole shape oscillations which have an azimuthal angular momentum projection @xmath148 . in the frame of reference rotating with the trap a quadrupole oscillation appears as a stationary distortion of the density profile in the @xmath143 plane @xcite and it is generated through a dynamical instability which has a threshold frequency @xmath149 that in the pure @xmath0-wave case is typically considerably higher than @xmath21 ( in the case of an axisymmetric trap @xmath150 ) .",
    "dynamical instabilities corresponding to shape oscillations play an important role in the _ dynamics _ of how a vortex actually enters the condensate , a subject we have not touched upon since we have only considered the energetics rather than the dynamics of vortex formation . in the case of pure @xmath0-wave condensates",
    "it is an experimental fact @xcite that in order to generate vortices the trap must be rotated at a frequency considerably exceeding the condition of energetic stability given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : lundhsol ] ) and instead corresponding closely to @xmath149 .",
    "the dynamical instability of a rotating dipolar bec to shape oscillations has recently been investigated @xcite , and it was found that dipolar interactions always lower the threshold rotational frequency @xmath149 at which the dynamical instability occurs , in both the prolate _ and _ oblate cases . it is interesting to note that in the pure @xmath0-wave case the threshold frequency for the instability is _ independent _ of interaction strength ( even though the instability relies on the existence of two - body interactions @xcite ) but , conversely , in the dipolar case is strongly affected by the magnitude of the interactions ( but perhaps , based on the discussion of section [ sec : analyticsol ] , the effect of dipolar interactions is simply through the degree to which these change the shape and aspect ratio of the condensate ) .",
    "one might tentatively conjecture , therefore , that as the critical rotation frequency for energetic favorability of the vortex state goes up , and the critical rotation frequency for the dynamical instability towards shape oscillations goes down , shape oscillations will be formed that will not go on to form vortices .",
    "let us now also briefly consider another possibility , namely oscillations of the centre of mass ( cm ) . in a harmonic trap cm oscillations decouple from internal excitations provided the interactions are pairwise , and therefore take place at the trap frequency .",
    "like low - lying shape oscillations , cm oscillations also preserve the parabolic density profile and so might be energetically preferable to a vortex in the presence of attractive interactions . consider a bec executing a cm oscillation of the form @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the position of centre of mass of the bec , which behaves like a classical particle of mass @xmath153 with potential energy @xmath154 .",
    "this circular motion has an angular momentum @xmath155 , with the actual value of @xmath156 being determined by the radius @xmath157 .",
    "note that ( [ eq : com ] ) describes dynamics obeying the superfluid irrotationality condition ( @xmath158 ) as may be verified by observing that the wave function which is an exact solution of the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation describing this type of motion is of the form @xcite",
    "@xmath159   \\exp \\left\\{\\mathrm{i } \\alpha(t)[x - a(t)/2]/\\hbar\\right\\ }   \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\exp \\left\\{\\mathrm{i } \\beta(t )   [ y - b(t)/2]/\\hbar\\right\\}\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\psi_{0}(x - a(t),y - b(t),z)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath160 is a stationary state satisfying the time - independent gross - pitaevskii equation , and the parameters @xmath161 obey @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 , @xmath165 .    the energy associated with the type of cm oscillations given by ( [ eq : com ] ) is @xmath166 . in order to make a comparison between the energy of the vortex state and the cm motion we set @xmath167 , so that the two have the same angular momentum .",
    "then @xmath168 , i.e. the radius of motion is equal to the trap oscillator length , and so @xmath169 . noting that the ground state energy , @xmath33 , is the same for both the vortex and cm motion , we can therefore compare @xmath170 with @xmath171 . in order to be competitive with a vortex ,",
    "cm motion with @xmath167 would therefore require @xmath172 , but this is exactly the rotational speeds for which the harmonic trap no longer confines the atoms and so we surmise that cm motion is not energetically favorable over a vortex state in a harmonic trap .",
    "this does not preclude , however , that centre of mass motion takes place in preference to other types motion for angular momenta @xmath173 .",
    "also , perhaps centre of mass motion can be favored in non - harmonic traps .",
    "the question of how quantum fluids rotate is a fascinating one .",
    "the versatility of atomic becs means that this problem can now be studied in systems with repulsive or attractive interactions , as well as the case of dipole - dipole interactions which are partially repulsive partially attractive and long range . in this paper",
    "we have used an approach based on an analogy to electrostatics that allows the explicit calculation of the anisotropic mean - field potential inside a dipolar bec .",
    "this approach gives quite general insight and in particular shows that the long - range part of the interaction is especially important in places where the density profile has a large curvature in the direction of polarization , such as the ends of vortices .",
    "numerical minimization of the total energy functional calculated by this method in the thomas - fermi regime indicates that , in comparison to the case of pure @xmath0-wave contact interactions , dipolar interactions lower the critical rotation frequency @xmath21 of a bec necessary to make a vortex energetically favorable in an oblate trap and raise the critical rotation frequency in a prolate trap .",
    "the same results can also be accurately reproduced using the analytic formula eq .",
    "( [ eq : lundhsol ] ) well known in the usual case of @xmath0-wave contact interactions providing the modification of the radius @xmath98 of the bec due to dipolar interactions is accounted for using eq .",
    "( [ eq : rxsol ] ) .",
    "the analytic formula allows one to attribute the principal change in @xmath21 caused by the dipolar interactions to changes in @xmath98 , i.e. large scale changes in the overall shape of the condensate , rather than changes on the much smaller scale of the healing length which determines the size of the vortex core . finally , we have also discussed angular momentum carrying shape oscillations as well as centre of mass oscillations as competitors to vortices in rotating prolate dipolar becs , and tentatively conclude that under certain circumstances shape oscillations such as the quadrupole oscillation may be preferred .",
    "we would like to thank s.  giovanazzi and a.m.  martin for many discussions .",
    "we are indebted to j.m.f .",
    "gunn for first suggesting to us the problem discussed in this paper and to l. santos for proposing we try the explicit solution described in sec [ sec : analyticsol ] .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge financial support from the engineering and physical sciences research council ( epsrc ) of the uk in the form of a postdoctoral fellowship in theoretical physics as well as qip - irc postdoctoral funding ( d.od . ) and from the royal society ( c.e . ) .",
    "in this appendix we write down the explicit expressions for the functionals giving the kinetic , trapping , @xmath0-wave scattering , and dipolar interaction energy of the condensate , as defined by equations ( [ eq : kedefn ] ) , ( [ eq : trapdefn ] ) , ( [ eq : swdefn ] ) , and ( [ eq : edd1 ] ) , respectively . beginning with the kinetic energy , we first note that in cylindrical coordinates the gradient is given by @xmath174 which acts upon the wave function given by the square root of the density ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) @xmath175 the phase @xmath176 accounts for the superflow around the vortex in the usual way , viz .",
    "@xmath177 @xcite . however , the thomas - fermi approximation corresponds to neglecting the kinetic energy arising from the curvature of the slowly varying condensate background envelope @xmath178 .",
    "we shall consequently drop all terms which originate from the gradient of this term . on the other hand , it is essential to retain the terms arising from the gradient of the vortex part of the wave function @xmath179 which varies rapidly in the @xmath180 direction , as well as the superflow term . under these approximations",
