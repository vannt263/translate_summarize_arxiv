    "type ib / c supernovae ( sne ) enjoyed a broadening in interest over the last few years since their compact progenitors ( helium or carbon stars ) are ideal for detecting the signatures of a central engine .",
    "such an engine is expected in the collapsar model ( woosley 1993 ; macfadyen , woosley & heger 2001 ) , the currently popular model for long - duration @xmath6-ray bursts ( grbs ) . in this model",
    ", the engine ( a rotating and accreting black hole ) provides the dominant source of explosive power .",
    "the absence of an extensive hydrogen envelope in the progenitor star may allow the jets from the central engine to propagate to the surface and subsequently power bursts of @xmath6-rays .    separately , the type ic sn1998bw ( galama et al . 1998 ) found in the localization region of grb980425 ( pian et al .",
    "2000 ) ignited interest in `` hypernovae '' .",
    "regardless of the controversy over the association of sn1998bw with grb980425 , or equivalently , the controversy over the relation of the extremely underluminous grb980425 to the cosmological grbs , one fact is not in dispute : _",
    "sn1998bw is a most interesting sn . _",
    "first , the sn exhibited the broadest absorption lines to date , about 60,000 km sec@xmath5 ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 ; woosley , eastman &  schmidt 1999 ) .",
    "second , modeling of the optical spectra and lightcurves suggested a large energy release , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the sn energy release in units of @xmath13 erg .",
    "finally , and most relevant to the issue of grb connection , the sn was the brightest radio sn at early times ; robust equipartition arguments led to an inferred energy of @xmath14 erg in ejecta with relativistic velocities , @xmath15 few ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1998 , hereafter k98 ) . until sn1998bw",
    ", no other sn showed hints of such an abundance of relativistic ejecta .",
    "tan , matzner &  mckee ( 2001 ) explain the relativistic ejecta as resulting from an energetic shock as it speeds up the steep density gradient of the progenitor .",
    "the @xmath6-ray and radio emission would then arise in the forward shock .    from the perspective of a grb",
    " sn connection , what matters most is the presence of relativistic ejecta .",
    "@xmath6-ray emission traces ultra - relativistic ejecta , but as was dramatically demonstrated by sn1998bw , the radio serves as an equally good proxy for relativistic ejecta with the added advantage that the emission is not beamed .",
    "given this , we began a systematic program of investigating at radio wavelengths all ib / c sne with features similar to sn1998bw : a hypernova or broad optical lines .",
    "y. hirose discovered in m74 ( distance , @xmath16mpc ; smartt et al .",
    "2002 ) on 2002 , jan .",
    "29.40 ut ( see nakano 2002 ) .",
    "mazzali et al .",
    "( 2002 ) inferred an explosion date of 2002 , jan .",
    "@xmath17 ut . attracted by the broad spectral features ( e.g. kinugasa et al . 2002 ; meikle et al .",
    "2002 ) we began observing the sn at the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "we observed starting on 2002 , february 1.03 ut . and detected a radio source coincident with the optical position at @xmath18(j2000)= , @xmath19(j2000)= , with a 1-@xmath20 uncertainty of 0.1 arcsec in each coordinate ( berger et al .",
    "2002a ) . a log of the monitoring observations and the resulting lightcurves can be found in tab .",
    "[ tab : obs ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : lcs ] , respectively .",
    "the peak radio luminosity of , @xmath21 erg sec@xmath5 hz@xmath5 , is a factor of 20 lower than the typical ib / c sne ( weiler et al .",
    "1998 ) , and @xmath22 times lower than sn1998bw ( k98 ) .",
    "the time at which the radio emission peaks at 5 ghz is @xmath23 day , which may be compared with 10 days for sn1998bw ( k98 ) , and 1030 days for the typical ib / c sne ( weiler et al . 1998 ; chevalier 1998 , hereafter c98 ) .",
    "the spectral index between 1.43 and 4.86 ghz , @xmath24 , changes from @xmath25 before day 6 , to @xmath26 at @xmath27 days ( @xmath28 ) , while @xmath29 holds steady at a value of @xmath30 .",
    "this indicates that the spectral peak , @xmath31 , is initially located between 1.43 and 4.86 ghz , and decreases with time .",
    "this peak could be due to synchrotron self - absorption ( ssa ) or ( predominantly ) free - free absorption ( ffa ) arising in the circumstellar medium ( csm ) .",
    "regardless of the dominant source of opacity , the emission for frequencies @xmath32 is from optically - thin synchrotron emission .",
    "massive stars lose matter via strong stellar winds throughout their life and as a result their csm is inhomogeneous with density , @xmath33 . here , @xmath34 is the distance from the star , @xmath35 is the rate of mass loss , and @xmath36 is the wind speed , which is comparable to the escape velocity from the star .",
    "the progenitors of type ii sne are giant stars which have low @xmath37 km s@xmath5 .",
    "consequently the csm is dense and this explains why the ffa model has provided good fits to type ii sne ( e.g. weiler , panagia &  montes 2001 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the progenitors of type ib and ic sne are compact helium and carbon stars which have high escape velocities and therefore fast winds @xmath38 km sec@xmath5 .",
    "thus , _ a priori _ , the csm density is not expected to be high .",
    "c98 reviews the modeling of radio lightcurves of ib / c sne and concludes that there is little need to invoke free - free absorption .",
    "however , synchrotron self absorption is an inescapable source of opacity and must be included in the modeling of type ib / c sne ( c98 ; k98 ) .",
    "low frequency observations provide the simplest way to discriminate between the two models . in the ssa model ,",
    "the peak frequency is identified with the synchrotron - self absorption frequency , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 . in the ffa model ,",
    "the free - free optical depth is unity at the peak frequency , @xmath41 and @xmath42 decreases exponentially .",
    "lacking the requisite discriminatory low frequency data we consider both models .      before performing a detailed analysis , we derive some general constraints using the well - established equipartition arguments ( readhead 1994 ; k98 ) .",
    "the energy of a synchrotron source with flux density , @xmath43 , can be expressed in terms of the equipartition energy density , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , @xmath46 @xmath47as , and @xmath48 erg .    at about day 7 , @xmath49 mjy ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lcs ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath50 @xmath47as , or @xmath51 cm .",
    "the resulting equipartition energy is @xmath52 erg , the magnetic field is @xmath53 g , and the average velocity of the ejecta is @xmath54 as inferred above .",
    "we note that any other source of opacity ( e.g. free - free absorption ) would serve to increase @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum from a source with power - law electron distribution , @xmath58 for @xmath59 (  [ sec : general ] ) is @xmath60 where the optical depth at frequency @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 and @xmath63 see li &  chevalier ( 1999 ; hereafter lc99 ) . here",
    "@xmath64 ( see rybicki & lightman 1979 ) , and @xmath65 is the characteristic synchrotron frequency of electrons with @xmath66",
    ". the subscript zero indicates quantities at a reference frequency which we set to 1 ghz .",
    "finally , @xmath39 is defined by the equation @xmath67 .",
    "the evolution of the synchrotron emission depends on a number of parameters .",
    "following c98 , we assume that @xmath68 , and the fraction of energy in electrons ( @xmath69 ) and magnetic fields ( @xmath70 ) in the post - shock region remain constant with time ; unless otherwise stated , @xmath71 .",
    "the evolution of the synchrotron spectrum is sensitive to the expansion radius of the forward shock front , @xmath72 , which is related to the density structure of the shocked ejecta and that of the csm .",
    "we allow for these hydrodynamic uncertainties by letting @xmath73 and @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the time days since the sn explosion . in the model adopted here ,",
    "both these indices depend on @xmath76 and @xmath68 .",
    "it can be shown that the temporal index of the optically thin flux , @xmath77 .",
    "the synchrotron characteristic frequency , @xmath65 , is particularly useful for inferring the csm density , and we parametrize it as @xmath78ghz where @xmath79 ghz . for typical values of @xmath76 , and @xmath80 , @xmath81 .    with these scalings and eqs .",
    "[ eqn : syn][eqn : f ] we carry a least - squares fit to the data . given the lack of early optically - thick data ( i.e.  1.43 ghz ) it is not surprising that our least - squares analysis allows a broad range of values for @xmath82 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lcs ] we plot fits spanning the minimum @xmath83 : @xmath84 ( corresponding to @xmath85 , respectively and 21 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "we note that for other ib / c sne @xmath82 range from @xmath86 to @xmath87 ( c98 ; lc99 ) .",
    "the fits , in conjunction with eqs .",
    "1315 of lc99 allow us to trace the evolution of the size of the expanding blastwave ( @xmath88 ) , the total ( magnetic+electrons ) energy ( @xmath89 ) , and the electron density ( @xmath90 ) in the shock ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] ) .",
    "we find that for @xmath91 , @xmath92 i.e. the blastwave decelerates .",
    "however , @xmath93 provides the expected @xmath94 . adopting this physically reasonable model , we obtain : @xmath95 , @xmath96 @xmath47jy , and @xmath97 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] we note that the early shock velocity is high , @xmath98 , regardless of the choice of @xmath82 , and close to that derived from the simple equipartition arguments (  [ sec : robust ] ) .    a simple extrapolation of our model , with a cooling break between the radio and x - ray bands ( as expected from the value of @xmath99 inferred in  [ sec : robust ] ) yields an x - ray flux comparable to the measurement by xmm - newton on 2002 , feb 3 , @xmath100 erg @xmath101 sec@xmath5 ( rodriguez pascual et al . 2002 ; soria & kong 2002 ) .",
    "in addition , the hardness ratio of the x - ray emission is consistent at the @xmath102 level with @xmath97 inferred from the radio data . thus x - ray emission due to other mechanisms ( e.g. thermal brehmsstrahlung ) must be quite small .",
    "the mass loss rate of the progenitor star is estimated from @xmath88 and @xmath90 , @xmath103 m@xmath3 yr@xmath5 , where the compression factor is @xmath104 , the nucleon - to - electron ratio is taken to be 2 and @xmath105 km sec@xmath5 .",
    "knowing @xmath106 and our assumed @xmath69 we find @xmath107hz and thus @xmath108 yr@xmath5  similar to that inferred for sn  1998bw ( lc99 ) .",
    "there are two consistency checks .",
    "first , with this @xmath109 , free - free absorption is negligible .",
    "second , the kinetic energy of the swept - up material is @xmath110 erg  consistent with our estimate of the equipartition energy and @xmath69 .",
    "the results of  [ sec : ssa ] can be tied in to a fairly simple hydrodynamic model .",
    "matzner & mckee ( 1999 ) show that for the progenitors of ib / c sne ( compact stars with radiative envelopes ) the ejecta post - explosion density profile can be described by power laws at low and high velocities , separated by a break velocity , @xmath111 km sec@xmath5 ; where the mass of the ejecta is @xmath112 .",
    "we use @xmath113 and @xmath114 for ( mazzali et al .",
    "2002 ) . at @xmath115 ,",
    "the density profile is given by @xmath116 g @xmath117 .",
    "this profile extends until radiative losses become important when the shock front breaks out of the star .",
    "32 of matzner & mckee ( 1999 ) this happens for @xmath118 ( assuming a typical 1 r@xmath3 radius for the progenitor star ) .",
    "thus , the outflow can become relativistic .    using the self - similar solution of chevalier ( 1982 )",
    "the velocity of the outer shock radius , @xmath119 , ( assuming a @xmath120 csm ) is @xmath121 where @xmath122 .",
    "the shock velocity , @xmath123 is insensitive to the circumstellar wind density . thus , we find that the velocities inferred from the radio observations of can be naturally accounted for by the outer supernova ejecta .",
    "the energy above some velocity @xmath124 is @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the velocity in units of @xmath127 . for the preferred sn 2002ap parameters , @xmath128 erg .",
    "there is therefore plenty of energy in the high velocity ejecta to account for the observed radio emission .",
    "indeed , given the over - abundance of @xmath129 relative to the energy inferred from the radio emission , we wonder how secure the are the estimates of @xmath12 and @xmath130 of mazzali et al . ( 2002 ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath12 and @xmath130 are derived from early time optical observations and are certainly subject to asymmetries in the explosion . for sn  1998bw , the asymmetric model of hflich ,",
    "wheeler & wang ( 1999 ) yielded @xmath131 , an order of magnitude smaller than that obtained from symmetrical models ( e.g. iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "interstellar scattering and scintillation ( iss ) is expected for radio sne ( see k98 ) .",
    "indeed , the perceptible random deviations from the model curves ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lcs ] ) , which account for the high @xmath132 could arise from iss .",
    "we compute the iss variability , specifically the modulation index ( the ratio of the rms to the mean ) of the observed flux , using the iss model of goodman ( 1997 ) . along the direction to using the galactic free electron model of taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) we find a scattering measure , @xmath133 m@xmath134 kpc and the distance to the scattering screen of @xmath135 kpc .    for radio sne",
    "there are two basic regimes of interest separated by the so - called transition frequency , @xmath136 .",
    "for @xmath137 , the _ weak scattering _ regime , the modulation index is @xmath138 [ for @xmath139 smaller than the fresnel size , @xmath140 @xmath47as ] and @xmath141 otherwise . for @xmath142 , the _ strong ( refractive ) scattering _ regime , @xmath143 [ for @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the fresnel size at @xmath136 ] , and @xmath147 otherwise .",
    "for  we find @xmath148 ghz . from fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] the source angular diameter , over the period 520 days , is @xmath149 @xmath47as , from which we estimate the following values : @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 .",
    "we estimate the actual modulation index empirically by adding @xmath153 in quadrature to each measurement error so that the reduced @xmath132 is unity .",
    "here @xmath154 is the model flux described in  [ sec : ssa ] .",
    "we find @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 , in good agreement with the theoretical estimates .",
    "this provides an independent confirmation of the size , and hence expansion velocity of the ejecta .",
    "in this model , the spectrum is parametrized as ( chevalier 1984 ; weiler et al .",
    "1986 ) : @xmath158 where @xmath159 ghz .",
    "we find an acceptable fit ( @xmath160 for @xmath161 degrees of freedom ) yielding : @xmath162 mjy , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and @xmath166 . with these parameters and eq .",
    "16 of weiler et al .",
    "1986 ) we find @xmath167 m@xmath3 yr@xmath5 for @xmath105 km sec@xmath5 .    in this model , one day after the explosion @xmath168 ghz , and @xmath169 mjy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lcs ] ) .",
    "the unabsorbed flux at the peak of the synchrotron spectrum is @xmath170 mjy ( note @xmath171 in the ffa model ) for which @xmath172 cm . thus @xmath173 , which corresponds to @xmath174 if relativistic effects are taken into account ( r. sari priv .",
    "comm . ) . alternatively ,",
    "if we fix the expansion velocity to the optical value , @xmath175 km sec@xmath5 ( mazzali et al . 2002 ) , we find a brightness temperature , @xmath176 k  clearly in excess of the equipartition temperature , again necessitating a high bulk lorentz factor , @xmath177 .",
    "thus , even if @xmath178 ( in which case free - free opacity would not be necessary in the first place ) , the ffa model requires truly relativistic ejecta , or alternatively a large departure from equipartition , resulting in @xmath179 erg ( for @xmath180 instead of @xmath181 ) .",
    "clearly , the energy requirement would increase by many orders of magnitude if @xmath182 .",
    "the type ic sn1998bw , likely associated with grb980425 , was peculiar in two ways .",
    "it exhibited broad photospheric absorption lines , and exceedingly strong radio emission at early times .",
    "the latter was interpreted to arise from relativistic ( @xmath15 few ) ejecta of total energy @xmath183 erg .",
    "these two peculiarities made sense in that the simple theory suggested that broad photospheric features are a reliable indicator of relativistic ejecta , a necessary condition for @xmath6-ray emission .",
    "the type ic sn2002ap elicited much interest because it too displayed similar broad lines .",
    "however , from our radio observations we estimate the energy in relativistic electrons and magnetic fields to be quite modest : @xmath184 ergs in ejecta with a velocity @xmath0 . in view of this , the absence of @xmath6-rays from is not surprising ( hurley et al .",
    "both the energy and speed of the ejecta can be accounted for in the standard hydrodynamical model .",
    "we thus conclude that broad photospheric lines are not good predictors of relativistic ejecta .    separately , the broad photospheric features led modelers to conclude that was a hypernova with an explosion energy of @xmath185 erg ( mazzali et al .",
    "2002 ) . however , the radio observations paint a different picture .",
    "the low @xmath186 make an ordinary type ib / c sn ( or perhaps even a low energy event ;  [ sec : general ] ) . we also draw attention to the significant role played by asymmetries in forming the optical lines which , when not properly accounted for can lead to discrepant estimates ( cf .  the large variations in the estimated sn energy release for sn1998bw ; see hflich , wheeler & wang 1999 ; iwamoto et al .",
    "thus , we wonder how reliable are the inferred @xmath12 and @xmath130 values . along the same vein",
    ", we note that kawabata et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggest , based on spectro - polarimetric observations , a jet with a speed of @xmath187 and carrying @xmath188 erg .",
    "such a jet , regardless of geometry , would have produced copious radio emission .",
    "we end with three conclusions .",
    "first , at least from the perspective of relativisic ejecta , was an ordinary ib / c sn . second , broad photospheric lines appear not to be a good proxy for either an hypernova origin or @xmath6-ray emission .",
    "third , radio observations offer a practical and accurate proxy for relativistic ejecta .    dale frail was involved in various aspects of this project and we are grateful for his help and encouragement .",
