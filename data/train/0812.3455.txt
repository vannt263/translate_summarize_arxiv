    "the supernova remnant g296.5 + 10.0 was observed using the australia telescope compact array at 1.4 ghz with an angular resolution of 30 arcseconds .",
    "signals from the dual linear polarized feeds were combined to produce images of the remnant in linear polarisation .",
    "the rotation measure synthesis method ( brentjens & de bruyn , 2005 ) was employed to obtain an rm spectrum at each pixel in the image ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the 104 mhz bandwidth was split into 13 @xmath0 8 mhz spectral channels , giving sufficient coverage in @xmath1@xmath2 to remove any n@xmath3 ambiguities in the rm values .",
    "x - ray data in the energy range 0.12.4 kev were taken from the rosat archive , via nasa s skyview .",
    "these complimentary data allow us to estimate the electron density in the remnant .",
    "in order to disentangle the electron density ( n@xmath4 ) and line - of - sight magnetic field ( @xmath5@xmath6 ) we measured the x - ray intensity at every point in the rosat image , after regridding and smoothing them to match the atca image . rm is defined as the integral of n@xmath4 and @xmath5@xmath6 along the line of sight .",
    "the thermal x - ray surface brightness , s@xmath7 , is proportional to n@xmath4@xmath2 .",
    "therefore if rm and s@xmath7@xmath8 are correlated , the faraday rotation is occurring within the thermal plasma ( matsui et al .",
    "a plot of rm vs. s@xmath7@xmath8 ( figure 2 ) shows that there is no clear correlation between rm and s@xmath7@xmath8 in the remnant , which means that the rms originate from the ism / halo along the line - of - sight .",
    "therefore the rm variations across the remnant may reflect the structure of the magnetised interstellar medium ( haverkorn et al .",
    "2004 ) and the smooth component may tell us about the overall magnetic field morphology within the remnant ( ransom et al .",
    "this will form the basis of our further analysis of these data .",
    "the following analytical steps will be taken : ( 1 ) modelling of the rm structure across the remnant to determine the large - scale structure and morphology of the magnetic field ( i.e. linear , spiral , toroidal ) in the remnant ( 2 ) analysis of smaller - scale rm variations across the remnant , to probe the turbulent scale - sizes in the ism and galactic halo ."
