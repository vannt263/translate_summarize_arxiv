    "a large good - walker component is expected , as in the ads / cft approach the main contribution to shadowing corrections comes from elastic scattering and diffractive production .",
    "* the pomeron self - interaction should be small ( of the order of @xmath7 in ads / cft correspondence ) , and much smaller than the vertex of interaction of the pomeron with a hadron , which is of the order of @xmath5 . *",
    "the last requirement follows from the natural matching with perturbative qcd : where the only vertex that contributes is the triple pomeron vertex .",
    "in our approach diffractive dissociation is taken into account in the framework of a two channel model , which we developed in @xcite .",
    "this enables us to express all the relevant cross sections , @xmath8,@xmath9,@xmath10,@xmath11 and the forward elastic slope @xmath12 in terms of three basic amplitudes @xmath13(s , b ) , @xmath14(s , b ) , @xmath15(s , b ) and a mixing parameter @xmath16 . satisfying the unitarity constraints we can parametrize the scattering amplitudes in the following simple form : @xmath17 our parametrization of the opacities",
    "@xmath18 will be discussed later .",
    "a deficiency of the good - walker approach is that it only accounts for diffraction in the region of small mass .      to calculate the contribution of produced large mass in diffraction dissociation , it is necessary to sum diagrams which contain pomeron - pomeron interactions .",
