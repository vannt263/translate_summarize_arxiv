    "this makes the analytical solution of the maxwell - bloch equations a challenging task . from classical considerations , it is possible to see that the polarization @xmath7 of a medium can be expressed as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the rabi frequency of the j - th field ( of frequency @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 is the dipole matrix element of the corresponding transition , @xmath12 is the density of the atomic medium and @xmath13 is the single - particle interaction hamiltonian .",

    "analogously , a photon of @xmath52 can not penetrate into the cavity if a @xmath195 photon is already there .",
    "the effects of the cavity dissipation and the atomic decay can be considered adding the term @xmath208 , where @xmath209 is the decay rate of the cavity and @xmath38 is the atomic decay rate as in section  [ doubleeit ] . if we consider @xmath210 , however , their effects are to give a small linewidth to each eigenvalue , in any case insufficient to create suitable conditions for transitions to the doubly excited manifold",
    ". the external driving term induces transitions between the two levels in which the system has been effectively reduced . from the optical bloch equations for a field interacting with a two - level atom ( with a decay rate small compared to the rabi frequency of the interaction ) in stationary conditions ,",
    "the population of the excited state of the atom is expected to reach @xmath211 ( the subscripts @xmath212 state the number of excitations in the ground and excited states ) . in our case , it is easy to prove that @xmath213 plays the role of a rabi frequency for the interaction between the external field and the cavity+atom system , whose ground and excited states are labeled as @xmath214 and @xmath215 . for the coupling between @xmath216 and @xmath217 , with @xmath218 ( weak pump regime ) and the parameters in fig .",

    ", we assumed the single - atom interaction .",
    "let us consider a case in which a number of atoms are present in the cavity .",
    "this could happen because , experimentally , we do not have a perfect control of the number of atoms that cross the cavity .",
    "it has been shown in  @xcite indeed that having more than a single atom in the cavity has the effect to introduce a large number of other energy levels that accumulate near the zero energy axis .",
    "this makes the photon blockade less effective .",
    "if we analyze our specific system , we see that the hamiltonian itself acquires a _ collective operator _ structure . in general ,",
    "atomic operators such as @xmath223 are replaced by @xmath224 , with @xmath56 labeling the @xmath12 particles inside the cavity .",
    "the injection of a photon into the cavity couples @xmath225 to@xmath226 where we introduced the collective states : @xmath227 with @xmath228 being a singly excited symmetric dicke state . to check the possibility for a photon blockade we have to seek the eigenvalues in the doubly excited manifold .",
    "let us consider the simple case of @xmath229 .",
    "the manifold with a single excitation is now composed of five bare states while they were three for the single atom case and there is an energy equal to @xmath230 ( @xmath231 ) if a photon from @xmath194 ( @xmath194 ) has excited the cavity field .",
    "transitions to the singly excited manifold are possible . if we consider the doubly - excited subspace , we find eigenenergies suitable for a resonant transition that ruins the blockade effect .",
    "this behaviour can be verified for the cases of @xmath232 and we conjecture that this feature is present for an arbitrary @xmath12 . to bypass this problem , we introduce a single photon detuning in the transitions @xmath23 , @xmath24 , while keeping the two - photon resonance .",
    "this implies the introduction of @xmath233 in the hamiltonian .",
    "if @xmath234 these terms take account of the detuning of the dressed states off the cavity resonance : it shifts the energies in the doubly excited manifold and restores the blockade . the absence of resonant energies for @xmath229 , @xmath235 and @xmath236 is shown in fig .  [ h11con1atomo ] * ( b)*. we have extended this investigation up to the case of @xmath237 .",
    "these results , obtained for values of the involved parameters achievable by current technology  @xcite , are in agreement with the analysis in  @xcite .",
    "we now introduce a quantum interference effect that explains the inhibition of transitions to highly excited states ( the low values for @xmath238 can not be explained just by the detuning from resonance  @xcite ) . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the case of a single atom inside the cavity .",
    "if the external fields shine together the cavity , they simultaneously try to excite the cavity field but , as long as one photon is fed into the cavity , there is no possibility for a second one to leak .",
    "we assume @xmath239 and we include the two eigenstates , @xmath221 and @xmath240 , that in fig .",
    "[ h11con1atomo ] ( * a * ) are the nearest to the zero energy axis .",
    "this permits to estimate the blockade effect from a different perspective .",
    "the resulting effective five - level model is in fig .",
    "[ interferenza ] . taking a value of @xmath241 ,",
    "the splitting of @xmath221 and @xmath240 from the resonance becomes symmetric ( as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ h11con1atomo ] * ( a ) * , even for @xmath242 , @xmath243 ) and we take it to be @xmath244 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian , in the basis composed of @xmath245 can be easily written for the couplings shown in fig .",
    "[ interferenza ] and its application to a state of the form @xmath246 leads to a schrdinger equation that can be recast in a set of five differential equations for the coefficients @xmath247 @xmath248 .",
    "we expect that the approximation of two - level system , consequence of the photon blockade , has to be good , so that the populations of states @xmath249 should remain very small .",
    "numerical integration of these equations confirms our expectations and we get @xmath250 .",
    "we thus neglect these terms and we find a simple analytical solution that results in rabi oscillations of the populations of states @xmath251 , @xmath200 , @xmath252 with the frequency @xmath253 , that matches the analogous parameter from @xmath238 .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ results ] .",
    "[ ht ]    the amplitudes of oscillation for @xmath254 and @xmath255 are @xmath256 , and they oscillate in phase ( absolutely indistinguishable in the plot ) .",

    "the calculation of @xmath257 and @xmath258 leads to : @xmath259 with @xmath260 .",
    "if we measure the state of the atom , as it exits from the cavity , and we find @xmath39 , the cavity modes are projected onto an entangled state with adjustable coefficients . even if we have just roughly outlined the problem , this certainly deserves a further analysis .",
    "this result seems to be promising in the perspective of quantum state engineering , in particular because no single - atom addressing is required .",
    "the main result of this work is the discussion of the quantized picture of a model for double - eit  @xcite .",
    "our approach is based on a full hamiltonian method that simplifies the problem of a many - level atomic system interacting with some electromagnetic fields .",
    "the results obtained have been confirmed by a dressed state approach .",
    "here , we have shown the cross - phase modulation of two interacting fields .",
    "we suggested the pr : yso crystal as a candidate to embody the model .",
    "the success of the quantization step has led us to investigate two particular problems in the context of quantum state engineering : the generation of entangled coherent states of light and a bi - chromatic photon blockade in cqed . in the former case ,",
    "a scheme for the inference of the non - classicality of the generated state has been briefly discussed , including the effects of losses by the detection apparatus .    for the photon blockade",
    ", we discussed the main features for the control of the population of two cavity field modes . considering a flux of atoms crossing a bi - modal cavity , we have shown the effectiveness of the blockade effect even when more than a single atom is present in the cavity . with respect to a solid state system ( as pr : yso ) placed into the cavity ,",
    "the examined set - up is more suitable for the realization of photon blockade because it overcomes a series of severe restrictions that in a multi - atom system are imposed because of the high - dispersion limit  @xcite .",
