    "the naive non - relativistic quark model@xcite tells us that a meson contains a quark and an anti - quark while a baryon is composed of three valence quarks .",
    "however , it is also noted that the exotic hybrid , glueball and multi - quark states are not excluded by the @xmath8 quark model . until now",
    "no any meson or baryon has been confirmed as an exotic state even though several resonances are considered to be exotic , namely have different component - structure from regular hadrons .",
    "there is not any principle to forbid their existence , and in fact the discussion about the exotic states has never stopped .",
    "for example the exotic structure of @xmath9 and @xmath10 is still under intense dispute @xcite .",
    "since the conventional @xmath11 structure can not well fit experimental data of certain modes@xcite , some authors proposed that they may be molecular states made of two color - singlet mesons or tetraquarks composed of a color - anti - triplet diquark and a color - triplet anti - diquark @xcite , .",
    "recently , a series of charmonium - like resonances have successively been experimentally observed , such as @xmath12@xcite , @xmath13@xcite , @xmath14@xcite , @xmath15@xcite and several bottomoniun - like states are also discovered by the belle and babar collaborations , such as @xmath7 and @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "it is noted that there is almost no room in the regular representations of @xmath17 to accommodate those newly observed resonances .",
    "especially these particles @xmath18 , @xmath7 and @xmath16 with non - zero charge can not be understood in the conventional @xmath19 structure if they are real resonances @xcite .",
    "concretely the mass of @xmath20 is between the mass of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , so it should have one b ( quark ) and one @xmath23 ( anti - quark ) but it by no means is a bottomonium because of its electric charge .",
    "apparently if it is verified to be a resonance it should be a multi - quark state , namely a molecular state or tetraquark should be the preferred choice since they are the simplest extension beyond the regular @xmath19 structure .",

    "the resonance @xmath25 was considered as a @xmath26 molecular state@xcite .",
    "whether two heavy mesons can form a molecular state has not been thoroughly investigated in those works@xcite .",
    "thus in this work we will try to study the question in the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) approach where the relativistic corrections are automatically included . besides the bound states of two pseudoscalars we also explore the bound states which contain one or two vectors . for the aim we need to deduce corresponding bs equations . since in this work",

    "we only deduce the bs equation for the bound state with @xmath32 because it should be the lightest molecular state and more favorable in the nature . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the lorentz structures of the others are very complicated and will be explored in our later works .",
    "when we solve the bs equations for these molecular states , two approximations are needed : the ladder approximation and instantaneous approximation . in general",
    "the energy exchange between the constituents is small compared to @xmath33 which characterizes the binding energy scale of the constituent mesons , so that the instantaneous approximation is applicable .",
    "the simple ladder approximation has been employed all along in the history , but recently some works suggest that the cross - ladder should be included@xcite . since our goal is to study the possibility of formation of molecular states instead of making precise theoretical predictions on the spectra we will still use the simple ladder approximation to gain our qualitative conclusion .    after this introduction",
    "we derive the bs equations for the @xmath30 and @xmath29 molecular states . then in section iii we present our numerical results of the binding energies along with explicitly displaying all input parameters .",

    "that is : if the eigenvalue of the bound state obtained by solving the bs equation is negative , namely the total mass of the system is lower than the sum of the masses of the two constituents , such a system is considered as a bound state , i.e. a hadronic molecule which may exist in the nature .",
    "now let us solve the bs equations .",
    "since the function @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 only depends on the norm of the three - momentum we may first integrate over the azimuthal angle of the function in ( [ 3-dim - bs1 ] ) , ( [ 3-dim - bs2 ] ) or ( [ 3-dim - bs3 ] ) @xmath101 to obtain a new form @xmath102 , then the bs equation turns into a one - dimension integral equation @xmath103 take ordered @xmath104 discrete values and the gap between two adjacent values be @xmath105 , then @xmath106 matrix @xmath107 .",
    "the scalar equation of @xmath107 would determine the @xmath104 eigenvalues @xmath108 and the smallest one should correspond to the binding energy of the ground state . in our calculation",
    "we take @xmath109 and the first discrete value of @xmath110 gev and the largest @xmath111 is @xmath112 gev .    in our calculation",
    "we need to determine the values of the parameters @xmath62 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 . by fitting the data of the decay",
    "processes where the couplings @xmath115 and@xmath116 are concerned , the authors of ref.@xcite obtained the cutoff parameter @xmath62 which can vary from 1gev to 4gev .",
    "their strategy was to fit the measured decay widths in terms of the theoretically derived formulas with @xmath62 , thus they obtained the rather wide range for @xmath62 .",
    "indeed such a wide range reduces our theoretical prediction power . instead , in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors suggested a relation : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the mass of the exchanged meson , @xmath119 is a number of @xmath120 and @xmath121 mev i.e. @xmath122gev for exchanging @xmath64 or @xmath65 . since there are uncertainties on @xmath62 we will choose @xmath123 gev , @xmath124 gev and @xmath125 gev to calculate the eigenvalues and compare the results .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath126 are fixed by fitting data @xcite .",
    "considering the flavor @xmath8 symmetry and heavy quark spin symmetry we believe that @xmath127 should be a not - bad approximation .",
    "instead of setting @xmath128 , we also let @xmath129 take various values from 2 to 4 to investigate dependence of the eigenvalues on those coupling constants .",
    "the masses of the concerned constituent mesons are directly taken from the databook @xcite as : @xmath130 gev , @xmath131 gev , @xmath132 gev and @xmath133 gev .",
    "it is noted that in those tables there are many places symbolized by @xmath134 which means such bound states can not exist because either the bs equation with the corresponding parameters has no solution at all , or the derived eigen - energy is not negative , namely the mass of the supposed - to - be bound state is larger than the sum of the two constituent mesons .",
    "we calculate the eigenvalues of these bound states of @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 respectively .",
    "apparently when the parameters @xmath62 and @xmath141(@xmath142 ) are reasonable , the corresponding bs equation is solvable . for the bound states of isospin @xmath2",
    "we can obtain the ground eigenvalues ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : decay1 ] ) .",
    "it implies that the two heavy mesons can form an isospin-0 molecular state by exchanging light mesons .",
    "however for @xmath3 we can not obtain eigenvalues which are below the threshold with the same parameters .",
    "the reason is that the contributions of exchanging @xmath64 and @xmath143 nearly cancel each other in the kernel @xmath144 .    .",
    "the eigenvalues of the ground molecular states ( @xmath2 ) when only @xmath64 and @xmath65 are exchanged between the constituents [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the above numerical results show that one can not obtain an @xmath3 bound state which is composed of two heavy mesons . the reason is the contributions from exchanges of @xmath64 and @xmath65 cancel each other for the quantum number @xmath3 , and the small coupling constant @xmath145 determines that including the @xmath5 contribution can not make a substantial change to the kernel .",
    "let us take another angle to look at this issue . with the understanding , now let us deliberately enhance the contribution of @xmath5 by enlarging its coupling with pseudoscalar and vector mesons .",
    "namely , we investigate to what value the coupling constant @xmath145 reaches , the two heavy mesons can form a molecular state .",
    "we notice that as the coupling constant @xmath146 the eigenvalues for @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 meet the criterion for forming stable molecular states and the results are shown in tab.[tab : decay5 ] . moreover , as we set the coupling constant @xmath150 and @xmath124 we can also obtain the mass of 3.864 gev for @xmath151 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that when we set @xmath124 gev and @xmath146 the mass of the bound state @xmath152 is 10.56 gev which is close to the mass of the newly observed narrow - structure resonance @xmath7 [ @xmath153 mev ] .",
    "in this work we study the possibility of two heavy mesons forming a hadronic molecule .",
    "we employ the bs framework to approach this goal because it may include the relativistic corrections automatically . in ref .",
    "@xcite the bs equation for the bound state of two pseudoscalar mesons was deduced whereas in this work we derive the bs equations of the bound states composed of one vector and one pseudoscalar with @xmath154 and the bound states composed of two vectors with @xmath32 .",
    "our numerical results indicate that when the parameters are within reasonable ranges two mesons indeed can form an @xmath2 molecular state but can not form an @xmath3 molecular state because the contribution of @xmath4meson is small , thus we conclude that the newly observed @xmath7 prefers a tetraquark structure or at most has a tiny fraction of the molecular state of @xmath155 .",
    "by contrast , if the coupling constant @xmath145 is enhanced by several times an @xmath3 molecular state might be formed .",
    "for example when we set @xmath124 gev and @xmath146 the mass of the @xmath3 bound state @xmath139 is 10.56 gev which is close to the mass of the newly observed narrow - structure resonance @xmath7 .",
    "therefore our qualitative conclusion is that either the observed @xmath7 is not a molecular state or the coupling of @xmath4meson with the pseudoscalar and vector mesons is several times larger than that given in the hhchpt .    since the parameters are fixed in various experiments and can span a relatively large range we can not expect all the numerical results which depend on the parameters , to be very accurate .",
    "the goal of this work is to study the possibility of two heavy mesons can form a molecular state .",
    "our results , even not accurate , have obvious qualitative significance .    in a recent work , ali et al .",
    "@xcite propose the tetraquark interpretation of the charged bottomonium - like states @xmath156 and @xmath157 , and find that with this ansatz their estimates on the production and decay fit the data well , thus they claim that the tetraquark interpretation is supported by the experimental measurments .",
    "this is consistent with our conclusion that the tetraquark structure of @xmath156 is preferred .",
    "definitely , further theoretical and experimental works are badly needed for gaining better understanding of the exotic structures of the heavy mesons .",
    "we thank dr . w. wang for drawing our attention to their work @xcite and we are glad to notice that the same conclusion is reached from completely different angles .",

    "<S> whether molecular states indeed exist in nature has been disputed for a long time . </S>",
    "<S> several new resonances have been observed in the recent experiments and they seem to be of exotic structures and some of them have been proposed to be molecular states . </S>",
    "<S> the very recent observation of @xmath0 mev ] and @xmath1 mev ] encourages the interpretation of multi - quark states . in the beter - salpeter ( bs ) approach , we study the possibility if two heavy mesons can form a molecular state by exchanging light mesons . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that two heavy mesons can form an isospin singlet ( @xmath2 ) bound state but can not form an isospin triplet ( @xmath3 ) when the contribution of @xmath4 exchange is reasonably small , i.e. as the coupling of @xmath5 with mesons @xmath6 takes the value given in previous literatures . </S>",
    "<S> thus we conclude that the newly observed @xmath7 should not be a molecular state , but a tetraquark state instead , at most , the fraction of the molecular state in the physical resonance @xmath7 is tiny . </S>"
