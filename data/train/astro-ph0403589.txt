    "angular momentum transport plays an essential role in accretion disks of cataclysmic variables .",
    "two mechanisms have been proposed so far : one is the turbulent viscosity as adopted in the standard accretion disk model of @xcite and the other is the direct dissipation by tidal spiral shocks on the accretion disk as first demonstrated by @xcite . the turbulent viscosity is a local physical process while the tidal spiral shocks have a global structure on the accretion disk .",
    "therefore , we have a chance to observe a global spiral shock structure when they play an essential role in the angular momentum transport of the accretion disk .",
    "such an observational evidence first came from the doppler maps of the dwarf nova ip peg outburst ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have long believed that tidal spiral structures can be detected even in orbital light curves of cataclysmic variables if the spiral patterns are prominent .",
    "at last we find such an evidence of spiral patterns on the accretion disk from the orbital light curves of v1494  aquilae .",
    "v1494  aquilae ( nova aquilae 1999 no.2 ) was discovered by a. pereira on 1999 december 1.785 ut at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it reached the visual maximum brightness of @xmath2 on dec 3.4 ut ( @xmath3jd 2,451,515.9@xmath4 ) and decayed at the rate of @xmath5 days and @xmath6 days @xcite .",
    "early phase spectra were taken by @xcite and @xcite , which show p - cyg profiles of hydrogen balmer lines with a blueshifted component of 1020 km  s@xmath7 and 1200 km  s@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "thus , v1494  aql has been classified as a fast nova . @xcite",
    "have summarized overall development of the v1494  aql light curve until autumn of 2003 ( for about 3 years ) .",
    "detailed spectral features have been reported by @xcite .",
    "a short - term periodic modulation was first reported by @xcite , who found 0.03 mag variations with a period of 0.0627 days from their 2000 june observation .",
    "@xcite analyzed 31 nights of ccd photometry during 2000 june - august and suggested a periodicity of 0.13467(2 ) days .",
    "the full amplitude of the variation in the @xmath8-band increased from 0.03 mag in june to 0.07 mag in august .",
    "their folded light curve shows a double - wave structure with a shallower dip at phase 0.5 , with about half the amplitude of the main periodicity .",
    "@xcite reported , based on unfiltered and @xmath8-band ccd photometry obtained on 12 nights during 2001 june - july , a robust change in the shape and amplitude of the 0.13467 days period .",
    "it had an eclipse shape with depth about 0.5 mag . a second shallow eclipse ( about 0.1 mag deep ) at phase 0.5",
    "can be seen .",
    "@xcite refined , based on @xmath9-band photometry during june and september of 2002 , the orbital period of 0.1346141(5 ) days .",
    "they pointed out that the orbital light curve is quite unusual in the sense that it is not similar to ordinary cataclysmic variables with a hot spot on the accretion disk .",
    "@xcite made a multicolor photometry and concluded that the eclipse depth is deeper in longer wave lengths ( deeper in @xmath10-band than in @xmath9-band ) .",
    "@xcite further discussed that such an eclipsing characteristic ( deeper in longer wave lengths ) can not be explained by the accretion disk or the irradiation effect of the companion because these two light sources have the opposite nature ( deeper in short wave lengths ) .",
    "thus , they suggested , as a model of v1494  aql orbital light curve , a self eclipsing accretion column in a magnetic polar .",
    "@xcite provided a time - development of the orbital light curves among 2001 november - december , 2002 august , and 2003 june .",
    "it sometimes shows a triple - wave structure as well as a double - wave structure .",
    "kato et al . suggested that some structures ( probably on the accretion disk ) fixed in the binary rotational frame are responsible for the orbital light curve because of the stability of out - of - eclipse light curve patterns .",
    "very recently , @xcite pointed out that a close companion to v1494  aql ( located @xmath11 southwest ) is brighter than v1494  aql itself in the very late phase of the outburst .",
    "they corrected the brightness of the orbital light curve and found that the depth of the eclipse is about twice deeper in magnitudes than before correction .",
    "the depth of the primary eclipse of v1494  aql has become deeper as the nova decayed .",
    "such a feature was also observed in the recurrent nova ci  aql 2000 outburst ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which the irradiation of the accretion disk plays an essential role @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect the accretion disk in v1494  aql is also responsible for the unusual wavy structure of the orbital light curve . in this letter",
    ", we model the orbital light curve .",
    "almost the same orbital light curve model as in the supersoft x - ray sources is adopted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which includes the irradiation effects of the accretion disk and of the companion .",
    "in addition , we assume two - armed spiral structures on the accretion disk to reproduce a triple - wave structure outside eclipse . in ",
    "2 , our numerical model for v1494  aql is briefly introduced and summarized .",
    "the numerical results are given in  3 .",
    "discussion follows in  4 .",
    "our binary model is illustrated in figure [ v1494_figure_late_i785 ] , which consists of a @xmath12 main - sequence star ( ms ) filling its roche lobe , a @xmath13 white dwarf ( wd ) , and a disk around the wd .",
    "the mass of the wd is roughly estimated from the decline rate of the decay phase ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , details of which will be published elsewhere .",
    "the mass of the companion is estimated from the mass - period relation for cataclysmic variables ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". a circular orbit is assumed .",
    "its ephemeris has recently been refined by @xcite .",
    "we use this ephemeris , i.e. , @xmath14 at eclipse minima .",
    "we also assume that the surfaces of the wd , the ms companion , and the accretion disk emit photons as a blackbody at a local temperature which varies with position . for the basic structure of the accretion disk , we assume an axi - symmetric structure with the size and thickness of @xmath15 and @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the outer edge of the accretion disk , @xmath18 is the effective radius of the inner critical roche lobe for the wd component , @xmath19 is the height of the surface from the equatorial plane , and @xmath20 is the distance on the equatorial plane from the center of the wd . here",
    ", we adopt @xmath21 .",
    "we obtain our modeled two - armed spiral structures by multiplying @xmath19 with @xmath22 , as defined below : @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 we further have a slope at the disk edge defined by @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "the above various disk parameters are assumed to be @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 for the disk shape of figure [ v1494_figure_late_i785 ] . here ,",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 specify the amplitudes of two spirals so that @xmath36 means just an anti - symmetric structure of spirals with the same height , @xmath37 determines the inverse of the pitch angle of logarithmic spirals , @xmath38 is the position angle of the spirals against the binary components , @xmath39 denotes the width of the spiral pattern and represents the height of the spiral against the thickness of the disk together with @xmath34 and @xmath35 , i.e. , @xmath40 at the edge of the disk for the disk shape of figure [ v1494_figure_late_i785 ] . in our light curve model",
    ", we mainly change four parameters , i.e. , the disk thickness ( @xmath41 ) , the inverse of the pitch angle of spirals ( @xmath37 ) , the position angle ( @xmath38 ) , and the heights of two spirals ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the other parameters that specify the disk shape are all fixed to be the above values .",
    "these parameters are roughly determined to mimic the results of 3d simulation model of accretion disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the luminosity of the wd is assumed to be @xmath43 because we do not know the exact wd luminosity at the time of observation .",
    "the disk and the companion star are strongly irradiated by the hot wd .",
    "the surfaces of the wd , the disk , and the companion star are divided into many patches as shown in figure [ v1494_figure_late_i785 ] . here",
    "we assume that each patch emits photons as a blackbody ( with a single temperature ) .",
    "each patch of the disk or of the companion is irradiated by visible ( front side ) patches of the hot wd .",
    "the total luminosity of the irradiated disk and companion is calculated by summing up the contributions from all patches .",
    "the irradiation efficiency is the same as that of @xcite , i.e. , 50% of the irradiated energy is emitted by photon but the residual 50% is converted into thermal energy of gas .",
    "the accretion luminosity of the disk is also numerically included , although its contribution to the optical light is much smaller than that of the irradiation effect ( see discussion of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the numerical method adopted here was fully described in @xcite .",
    "the inclination angle ( @xmath44 ) of the binary is a free parameter that is determined from our light curve fitting .",
    "the original temperature of the companion star is assumed to be 3,000 k , but the shape of the orbital light curve is hardly changed even if we take 2,000 k or 4,000 k for the original temperature of the ms companion .",
    "the adopted system parameters are summarized in table [ system_parameters_v1494_aql ] .",
    "the best fit model is plotted in figure [ vmag_wd1000m03_quiescence_kiss ] by a thick solid line .",
    "the orbital modulations of v1494  aql have been reported by several groups . here , we adopt data of two groups @xcite to fit with our modeled light curves .",
    "kato et al.s ( square ) data have been corrected by using kiss et al.s ( circle ) data , because kato et al.s original data include the light from the close companion .",
    "we have changed five parameters ( @xmath41 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath42 , @xmath44 ) independently and calculated the total of @xmath45 orbital light curves .",
    "it takes about 6 hours to calculate one orbital light curve on a @xmath46 ghz pentium 4 processor , because the surface patch elements are @xmath47 for the companion surface , @xmath48 ( up and down sides ) ) for the disk , and @xmath49 for the wd , and the total of 129 steps for one orbital period .",
    "we have used 5 cpus , so that it took the total computation time of about 1600 hours , i.e. , @xmath505 cpus .",
    "we have found , by the least square method , the best fit model for out - of - eclipse ( orbital phase @xmath51 ) , i.e. , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath29 , @xmath55 .",
    "for the best fit model , we increase the number of patches for the disk up to @xmath56 ( up and down sides ) ) in order to calculate a rather smooth light curve .",
    "such a high quality light curve is shown in figure [ vmag_wd1000m03_quiescence_kiss ] .",
    "the triple - wave structure of out - of - eclipse orbital light curve is reasonably and naturally reproduced with our spiral shock pattern model .",
    "both the thickness of the accretion disk and the pitch angle of spirals adopted here are roughly consistent with the 3d simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the present results strongly support the two - armed spiral pattern on the accretion disk .",
    "we hope a spectroscopic confirmation of this spiral pattern by doppler maps for v1494  aql .",
    "the orbital light curve varies from night to night as shown in figure 3 of @xcite .",
    "such a scatter is also clearly shown in the present figures 2 and 3 for kiss et al.s ( 2004 ) data . to reproduce this variation ,",
    "we have changed parameter @xmath34 and @xmath35 independently ( see fig .",
    "[ vmag_wd1000m03_quiescence_kiss_2 ] ) .",
    "the variation appears in orbital phase of @xmath57 and the upper and lower bounds for these variations can be well reproduced by the models of @xmath58 , @xmath59 for the upper bound , and @xmath60 , @xmath61 for the lower bound . here ,",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 represent the height of the spiral arm in the rear and front side on the disk of figure [ v1494_figure_late_i785 ] , respectively .",
    "the other parameters are the same as those in figures [ v1494_figure_late_i785 ] and [ vmag_wd1000m03_quiescence_kiss ] .",
    "it is remarkable that the peak at orbital phase @xmath62 is rather stable and never disappears .",
    "this is consistent with the robustness of the period for the out - of - eclipse shape as emphasized by @xcite .",
    "@xcite discussed the main light source for the wavy structures of the out - of - eclipse orbital light curve .",
    "they argued , as a light source , ( 1 ) accretion disk , ( 2 ) ellipsoidal shape of the companion , ( 3 ) reflection ( irradiation ) effect of the companion by the hot white dwarf , ( 4 ) intermediate polar activity , and ( 5 ) polar activity self - eclipsed by the accretion column .",
    "they rejected possibilities ( 1)-(4 ) and suggested a viable model of polar activity .",
    "their reasons rejecting possibilities ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) are reasonable but not for possibilities ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) as discussed below .",
    "@xcite rejected the possibility of accretion disk by pointing out two reasons : ( i ) the maximum duration of the eclipse of the disk limited by the roche lobe size and it can not exceed a quarter of the orbital phase while the overall duration of the eclipse is as large as 0.45 of the orbital period .",
    "( ii ) the peak of light emission of the accretion disk lies in the blue region of the spectrum , so that the amplitude of the eclipse should increase as the wavelength becomes shorter ( `` as the wave length is increased '' in their text is mistaken ) .",
    "however , they observed the opposite trend : the amplitude in the red region is much more deeper than in the visual region .",
    "as for the first conjecture ( i ) , based on the accretion disk model together with the irradiation effects of the disk and the companion , we have already constructed the orbital light curves that match well the observational data .",
    "second , we should be careful with the above statement ( ii ) because the depth of the primary eclipse varies from night to night as seen in figure 3 of @xcite and its depth changes as large as @xmath63 between different periods of the observations as shown in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "pavlenko et al.s ( 2003 ) @xmath8 and @xmath10 light curves are not simultaneous ones but taken in different periods ( @xmath8 is earlier than @xmath10 ) . the @xmath9 light curve is reconstructed from barsukova & goranskii s ( 2003 ) data .",
    "they also rejected possibility ( 3 ) based on the same statement as ( ii ) discussed above .",
    "however , their multi - color results may simply suggest the fact that the eclipse depth varies from period ( night ) to period ( night )",
    ". therefore , we can not conclude statement ( ii ) only from the different depths at the different periods .    for the assumed wd luminosity of @xmath64 , the distance modulus",
    "is obtained to be @xmath65 and the corresponding distance is estimated to be @xmath66 kpc ( see table [ system_parameters_v1494_aql ] ) . however",
    ", this does not mean the real distance to v1494  aql because we do not know the real luminosity of @xmath67 at the time of the two observations .",
    "for instance , if we adopt @xmath68 , the shape of the orbital light curve hardly changes but the distance modulus becomes @xmath69 and @xmath70 kpc .",
