    "however , to further increase the coherence times of these qubits for manipulation of their quantum states , one must find ways to reduce the amount of noise intrinsic to the qubit , as well as noise introduced by the readout process itself .",

    "this switching generates quasiparticles , and thus such readout approach is limited by the subsequent decoherence .",
    "more recently dispersive readout schemes have been developed such that the qubit is coupled to a resonator , and the state of the qubit is detected as a shift in the resonance frequency of the resonator . as a result , the readout process requires only lower input biases and hence minimizes the generation of quasiparticles .",
    "furthermore , the resonator also acts as a narrow - band filter which shields the qubit from broadband noise .",

    "the qubit is coupled to the squid inductor , and the flux state of the qubit is detected as a shift in the resonance frequency of the resonator by means of magnitude and/or phase measurements .",
    "our approach differs from other resonant - type experiments in two main ways .",
    "first , our qubit and readout circuit were fabricated on the same chip from niobium , whereas the implementations in @xcite-@xcite were aluminum - based .",

    "when the external magnetic flux threading the qubit loop is biased near half a flux quantum , the two lowest energy states correspond to oppositely circulating persistent currents in the qubit loop .",
    "the induced flux of the persistent current ( and hence the state of the qubit ) is detected by a squid magnetometer which surrounds the qubit .    in the resonant readout scheme",

    "finally , it should be mentioned that while operating the resonant readout in the linear regime keeps the input bias low and reduces the level of decoherence on the qubit , the readout operated in the nonlinear regime has the advantage of being used as a bifurcation amplifier @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the bias frequency @xmath116 can be chosen within the bistable region of the nonlinear spectrum such that the system has two stable solutions corresponding to different voltages .",
