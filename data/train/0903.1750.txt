    "since a large aggregate of dust grains embedded in a plasma can attain virtually all known states of matter @xcite , the ability of optical tracking of individual grain trajectories has made these systems particularly attractive for studying transport properties and emergent complex behavior in soft materials .    in a number of recent dusty plasmas experiments anomalous properties , like non - gaussian displacement distributions and anomalous diffusion ,",
    "have been observed .",
    "yet it is not clear whether this behavior derives from non - equilibrium physics due to external forcing of the grain aggregate , or whether critical fluctuations @xcite and anomalous transport may emerge in aggregates subject exclusively to statically screened coulomb forces and independent stochastic forcing and friction due to collisions with the background neutral gas .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the latter is possible , and that non - gaussian statistics does not have to arise from particular non - equilibrium physics .",
    "so far few molecular - dynamics ( md ) or langevin - dynamics ( ld ) simulations of dust transport have been able to reproduce the anomalous results observed in experiments , although subdiffusion on short time scales have recently been reported for a bidispersive disordered assembley of yukawa particles @xcite .",
    "here we adopt the terminology employed in @xcite , where md refers to simulation of an aggregate of particles interacting via yukawa forces and ld refers to a system that in addition is subject to stochastic forcing and friction represented by a langevin thermostat .",
    "the latter represents a heat bath which should allow the system to relax to thermodynamic equilibrium with the neutral gas .    under ground - based laboratory conditions dust grains levitate in electrostatic sheaths , which give rise to plasma anisotropy and supra - thermal ion flows that may act as external forcing .",
    "such experiments are referred to as two - dimensional ( 2d or quasi-2d ) due to the fact that vertical motion of particles is severely restricted ( monolayers ) and/or particles are vertically aligned due to the ion flow .",
    "dust transport under such conditions has been extensively studied both in laboratory @xcite and simulations @xcite .",
    "anomalous transport exhibiting gaussian @xcite as well as non - gaussian @xcite statistics has been reported for both 2d and quasi-2d cases .    in this paper",
    "we show that a model that includes only yukawa interaction between particles , an externally imposed confining potential , and stochastic heating and dissipation from neutrals , is able to demonstrate emergence of non - gaussian statistical features associated with observed cooperative particle hopping @xcite and vortical flow patterns @xcite .",
    "the simulations also reveal some features for which we report the experimental footprint here for the first time - the development of humps on the displacement probability distribution function ( pdf ) corresponding to integer multiples of the mean inter - grain distance @xmath4 .",
    "we study quasi-2d systems with varying ",
    "stiffness \" , with particular attention paid to the transition in transport characteristics from time scales @xmath6 to @xmath5 , where @xmath2 is the characteristic time for a dust grain to diffuse a distance @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath7 . for this purpose",
    "we analyze data from ground - based laboratory experiments ( quasi-2d ) and perform molecular dynamics simulations in quasi-2d and 2d over a range of states , from pure crystal to liquid with particular focus on soft ( viscoelastic or hexatic ) states at the transition between crystal and liquid .    by examining and contrasting these data ,",
    "the following picture emerges : the shape of the position displacement distribution @xmath8 $ ] is gaussian for times shorter than the grain - grain collision time @xmath9 . on these short time",
    "scales the grain motion is ballistic , and the displacement divided by @xmath10 can be interpreted as the instantaneous grain velocity .",
    "hence the gaussian displacement pdf reflects the maxwellian velocity distribution resulting from the gaussian stochastic heating term . on scales",
    "@xmath11 the pdf develops a leptokurtic shape . for stiffer systems , as @xmath10 approaches @xmath2 humps develop on the tail of the pdf at displacements @xmath0 corresponding to integer multiples of @xmath4 .",
    "these humps signify that on these time scales the grain hopping in the imperfect hexagonal lattice influences the statistical transport characteristics . on even longer time scales ,",
    "the kurtosis of the pdfs approach that of a gaussian , indicating that multiple hoppings may represent a sequence of independent transport events @xcite .    in softer systems the picture on intermediate and longer time scales is different .",
    "the humps due to hopping are masked by the emergence of large - scale vortical motions , and the pdfs on the hydrodynamical time - scales reflect these vortex motions .",
    "an interesting observation is that gaussian statistics characterizes both the solidified crystalline state and the pure liquid state .",
    "non - gaussian statistics appears when the crystal is sufficiently soft to allow development of defects and particle hopping , but sufficiently stiff to restrict free diffusion on scales larger that @xmath4 .",
    "it appears on spatial displacement scales from a fraction of @xmath4 and at least up to those scales where elasticity dominates over viscosity .",
    "the fact that gaussian statistics and normal transport is restored in the purely liquid phase , indicates that the anomalous characteristics are associated with critical fluctuations in the form of a scale - free hierarchy of vortices @xcite .",
    "the vortices emerge from the stochastic forcing only if the lattice resides in a soft , viscoelastic transitional state between crystal and liquid .",
    "we also discuss the possible physical origin of non - gaussian displacement distributions and anomalous transport , and show how these feature derive naturally from a single - particle langevin equation with a non - linear drift ( friction ) term modeling the collective effects of dust - dust interaction .",

    "moreover , we have shown that this complex dynamics emerges from stochastic forcing and dissipation provided by the collisions with the neutral gas , and that no other plasma effects than the static debye screening are required .    from the experiments and the langevin dynamics simulations we observe that gaussian displacement distributions are restricted to the following cases : ( i ) on time scales less than the collision time @xmath9 in all systems , ( ii ) on all time scales for systems that are so stiff that no hopping takes place ( pure crystal ) , ( iii ) on all time scales for systems where no caging occurs ( pure liquid or gas ) , ( iiii ) for time scales longer than @xmath2 in soft systems .    a result that seems to be robust for both stiff and soft states ,",

    "this feature is usually interpreted as a signature of intermittency - a spikyness in the flow - field which gives rise to more leptokurtic pdfs of the displacements on the small scales .",
    "note that intermittency does not prevail to spatial scales less than @xmath4 . a simple way to model this intermittency feature is via the single - partice stochastic equation ( [ langevin3 ] ) , and the associated linear fokker - planck equation ( [ fp ] ) , with a non - linear drift term given by eq .",

    "@xcite it is pointed out that the dust monolayer should be perceived as a viscoelastic medium , where the elastic properties dominate on the smaller scales .",

    "one future goal would be to perform experiments and simulations on sufficiently large spatial and temporal scales to characterize the transport associated with homogeneous , turbulent flow in such systems . with such extensive simulations one could clarify , for instance , if energy will cascade to vortices on infinitely large scales in an infinite system , or if there is an upper limit to the vortex size related to the characteristic length over which elasticity dominates over viscosity .",
