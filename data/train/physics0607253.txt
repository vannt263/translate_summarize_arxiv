    "an important part of the visual system of vertebrate animals are the neural connections between the eye and the brain . at an initial stage of ontogenesis",
    "the ganglion cells of the retina have random synaptic contacts with the tectum , a part of the brain which plays an important role in processing optical information . in the adult animal , however , neighboring retinal cells project onto neighboring cells of the tectum ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "further examples of these so - called _ retinotopic _ projections are established between the retina and the corpus geniculatum laterale as well as the visual cortex , respectively @xcite .",
    "this conservation of neighborhood relations is also realized in many other neural connections between different cell sheets .",
    "for instance , the formation of ordered projections between the mechanical receptors in the skin and the somatosensorial cortex is called somatotopy .",
    "an even more abstract topological projection arises when the spatially resolved detection of similar frequencies in the ear are projected onto neighboring cells of the auditorial cortex .",
    "a further notable neural map in the auditory system was discovered in the brain of the owl , where neighboring cells of the _ nucleus mesencephalicus lateralis dorsalis _ ( mld )",
    "are excited by neighboring space areas , i.e.  every space point is represented by a small zone of the mld @xcite .",
    "the variety of examples suggest that there must be some underlying general mechanism for rearranging the initially disordered synaptic contacts into topological projections .",
    "+ in the early 1940s , sperry performed a series of pioneering experiments in the visual system of frogs and goldfish @xcite .",
    "fish and amphibians can regenerate axonal tracts in their central nervous system , in contrast to mammals , birds and reptiles .",
    "sperry crushed the optical nerve and found that retinal axons reestablished the previous retinotopically ordered pattern of connections in the tectum .",
    "then in the early 1960s sperry presented his chemoaffinity hypothesis which proposed that the retinotectal map is set up on the basis of chemical markers carried by the cells @xcite .",
    "however , experiments over several decades have shown that the formation of retinotectal maps can not be explained by this gradient matching alone @xcite .",
    "+     in the course of ontogenesis originally disordered mappings between retina and tectum evolve into ordered projections.,width=415 ]    the group of von der malsburg suggested that these ontogenetic processes result from self - organization .",
    "the basic notion in their theory is the following : once a fibre has already grown from the retina to the tectum , the fibre moves along by strengthening its contacts in some parts of its ramification and by weakening them in others .",
    "it is assumed that these modifications are governed by two contradictory rules @xcite : on the one hand , synaptic contacts on neighboring tectal cells stemming from fibres of the same retinal region support each other to be strengthened . on the other hand ,",
    "the contacts starting from one retinal cell or ending at one tectal cell compete with each other . in the case",
    "that retina and tectum are treated as one - dimensional discrete cell arrays , extensive computer simulations have shown that a system based on these ideas of cooperativity and competition establishes , indeed , retinotopy as the final configuration @xcite .",
    "this finding was confirmed by a detailed analytical treatment of hussler and von der malsburg @xcite where the self - organized formation of the synaptic connections between retina and tectum is described by an appropriate system of ordinary differential equations . applying the methods of synergetics @xcite for one - dimensional discrete cell arrays",
    ", they succeeded in classifying the possible retinotopic projections and to discuss the criteria which determine their emergence .",
    "the more complicated case of continuously distributed cells on a spherical shell was partially discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . + it is the purpose of this paper to follow the outline of ref .",
    "@xcite and generalize the original approach by elaborating a model for the self - organized formation of retinotopic projections which is _ independent _ of the special geometry and dimension of the cell sheets .",
    "there are three essential reasons which motivate this more general approach .",
    "first , neurons usually do not establish 1-dimensional arrays but 2- or 3-dimensional networks .",
    "hence the 1-dimensional model of hussler and von der malsburg can only serve as a simplistic approximation of the real situation .",
    "secondly , we want to include cell sheets of different extent , which is a more realistic assumption than neural sheets with the same number of cells .",
    "the third reason is that a general model is able to reveal what is generic , i.e.  what is independent of the special geometry of the problem .",
    "thus , here we generalize the hussler equations to continuous manifolds of arbitrary geometry . by doing so",
    ", we proceed in a phenomenological manner and relegate a microscopic derivation of the underlying equations to future research .",
    "+ it should be emphasized that our main objective is not the biological modelling of retinotopy . instead of that our considerations are devoted to the analysis of the dynamics of the nonlinear hussler equations by using mathematical methods from nonlinear dynamics and synergetics .",
    "for the more biological aspects of retinotopy and the vast progress in modelling various retinotopically ordered projections during the last twenty years we refer the reader to the reviews  @xcite .",
    "+ in section [ secmo ] we present the general framework of our model and introduce the equations of evolution for the connection weights between retina and tectum .",
    "we then perform in section [ secli ] a linear stability analysis for the equations of evolution around the stationary uniform state and discuss under which circumstances an instability arises . in section [ nonli ]",
    "we apply the methods of synergetics , and elaborate within a nonlinear analysis that the adiabatic elimination of the fast evolving degrees of freedom leads to effective equations of evolution for the slow evolving order parameters .",
    "they approximately describe the dynamics near the instability where an increase of the uniform growth rate of new synapses onto the tectum beyond a critical value converts an initially disordered mapping into a retinotopic projection .",
    "finally , section  [ summary ] and [ outlook ] provide a summary and an outlook .",
    "in this section we summarize the basic assumptions of our general model .",
    "we start with representing retina ( @xmath0 ) and tectum ( @xmath1 ) by general manifolds @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . in the framework of an embedding of these manifolds in an euclidean space of dimension @xmath4 ,",
    "the coordinates @xmath5 , @xmath6 of the corresponding cells can be represented by @xmath7 in the following we need measures of distance , i.e.  metrics @xmath8 , @xmath9 on the manifolds .",
    "the intrinsic coordinates of the @xmath10-dimensional manifolds @xmath3 , @xmath2 are denoted by @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the vectors ( [ xtxr ] ) of the euclidean embedding space can be parametrized according to @xmath13 , @xmath14 . with the covariant metric tensors @xmath15 the line elements on the manifolds",
    "are given by @xmath16 the geodetic distances between two points of the manifolds read @xmath17 we define a measure for the magnitudes of the manifolds by @xmath18 where we integrate over all elements of @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "we characterize the neural connectivity within each manifold @xmath2 , @xmath3 by cooperativity functions @xmath19 , @xmath20 . in lack of any theory for the cooperativity functions we regard them as time - independent , given properties of the manifolds which are only limited by certain global plausible constraints .",
    "we assume that the cooperativity functions are positive @xmath21 that they are symmetric with respect to their arguments @xmath22 and that they fulfill the normalization conditions @xmath23 furthermore , it is neurophysiologically reasonable to assume that the cooperativity functions @xmath19 , @xmath24 are larger when the distance between the points @xmath25 and @xmath26 is smaller .",
    "this condition of monotonically decreasing cooperativity functions can be written as @xmath27      the neural connections between retina and tectum are described by a connection weight @xmath28 for every ordered pair @xmath29 with @xmath30 . in this paper we are interested in the temporal evolution of the connection weight @xmath28 which is essentially determined by the given cooperativity functions @xmath19 , @xmath20 of the manifolds @xmath2 , @xmath3 . to this end",
    "we generalize a former ansatz of hussler and von der malsburg @xcite and assume that the evolution is governed by the following system of ordinary differential equations @xcite : @xmath31 \\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{w(t , r)}{2m_r}\\hspace*{1mm}\\int\\ ! dr'\\left [ \\alpha+w(t , r ' ) \\,\\int\\ ! dt ' \\ , \\int\\ !",

    "therefore , this cooperative contribution is integrated with respect to @xmath37 , @xmath38 and added to the uniform growth rate @xmath32 to yield the total growth rate ( [ gro ] ) between @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "apart from this cooperative term in the equations of evolution ( [ hausb ] ) , the remaining terms describe competitive processes .",
    "the second term accounts for the fact that growth rates between @xmath33 and @xmath38 compete with the connections between @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( see figure [ fig2]b ) .",

    "we obtain equations for the mode amplitudes of the unstable and stable modes , respectively . in the vicinity of the instability point the system generates a time - scale hierarchy , i.e.  the stable modes evolve on a faster time - scale than the unstable modes .",
    "this leads to the _ slaving principle _ of synergetics : the stable modes are enslaved by the unstable modes . in the literature",
    "this enslaving @xmath170 is usually achieved by invoking an adiabatic elimination of the stable modes , which amounts to solving the equation @xmath171 .",
    "however , the mathematically correct approach for determining the center manifold @xmath172 is to determine it from the corresponding evolution equations for the stable modes @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that only for real eigenvalues this approach leads to the same result obtained by the approximation @xmath171 .",
    "thus , it is possible to reduce the original high - dimensional system to a low - dimensional one which only contains the unstable amplitudes .",
    "the general form of the resulting order parameter equations ( [ ope ] ) is independent of the geometry of the problem .",
    "it contains typically a linear , a quadratic and a cubic term of the order parameters . as a general feature of synergetics , the coefficients ( [ ope ] ) , ( [ bb ] ) consist of two parts , one stemming from the order parameters themselves and the other representing the influence of the center manifold on the order parameter dynamics .",
    "+ our results can be interpreted as an example for the validity of the circular causality chain of synergetics , which is illustrated in figure  [ zirkaus ] . on the one hand",
    ", the order parameters , i.e.  the few amplitudes @xmath173 of the slowly evolving linear unstable modes @xmath174 , enslave the dynamics of the many stable mode amplitudes @xmath175 of the fast evolving stable modes @xmath176 through the center manifold . on the other hand ,",
    "the center manifold of the stable amplitudes acts back on the order parameter equations .",
    "the order parameter equations ( [ ope])([bb ] ) represent the central new result of this paper , and in the forthcoming publication @xcite they will serve as the starting point to analyze in detail the self - organization in cell arrays of different geometries . to this end",
    "we assume that the manifolds are characterized by spatial homogeneity and isotropy , i.e.  neither a point nor a direction is preferred to another , respectively .",
    "this additional assumption requires the manifolds to have a constant curvature and their metric turns out to be the stationary robertson - walker metric of general relativity @xcite .",
    "we therefore have to discuss the three different cases where the curvature of the manifolds is positive , vanishes , or is negative .",
    "this corresponds to modelling retina and tectum by the sphere , the plane , or the pseudosphere . + a further intriguing problem concerns the question under what circumstances non - retinotopic modes become unstable and destroy the retinotopic order .",
    "one could imagine that some types of pathological development in animals corresponds to this case .",
    "+ as already mentioned , lacking any theory for the cooperativity functions , we have regarded them as time - independent given properties of the manifolds .",
    "they are determined by the lateral connections between the cells of retina and tectum , respectively @xcite .",
    "but neither a reason for their time - independence nor a detailed discussion of their precise mathematical form is available . to fill this gap",
    "it will be necessary to elaborate a self - consistent theory of the cooperativity functions .",
    "+ our generalized hussler equations are fully deterministic . in real systems , however , there are always fluctuations . to take into account such unpredictable small variations a stochastic force has to be added to the deterministic part of the equation .",
    "such fluctuations are known to play an important role , especially in the vicinity of instability points @xcite .",
    "+ finally , delayed processes could be included in our considerations .",
    "synergetic concepts have been successfully applied to time - delayed dynamical systems in refs .",
    "@xcite . in neurophysiological systems delays occur due to the finite propagation velocity of nerve signals @xcite as well as the finite duration of physiological processes such as the change of synaptic connection weights .",
    "thus , it would be also worthwhile to expand the investigations to time - delayed hussler equations .",
