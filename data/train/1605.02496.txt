    "during last decade , due to experimental data of the belle , babar , lhcb , d0 and bes collaborations , which provided valuable information on the so - called exotic hadron states , this branch of high energy physics demonstrates a rapid growth .",
    "the exotic hadrons , i.e. ones that can not be embraced by the spectroscopy of the known hadrons as @xmath11 or @xmath12 bound states , may serve as a laboratory for testing the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd)- the existing theory of strong interactions , as well as various phenomenological models built of on its basis .",
    "an existence of the exotic hadrons does not contradict the fundamental principles of this theory .",
    "though relevant problems attracted an interest of physicists from first years of the parton model and , later qcd , only recently these ideas found their experimental confirmation .",
    "the discovery of the charmonium - like resonance @xmath13 by the belle collaboration @xcite was the first brick laid on footing of the house , which now exists as xyz family of the exotic states .",
    "the observation made by the belle was later reexamined and confirmed by other collaborations @xcite .",
    "produced in the @xmath14 meson decays or in the @xmath15 collisions , observed in the @xmath16 annihilation or in the two - photon fusion , exotic states remain on the focus of the main experimental collaborations , which collected wide data base on the processes of interest .",
    "a considerable progress was made in the theoretical understanding of the features of the exotic states , as well .",
    "if experiments are devoted to measuring of the masses , and decay widths , to identifying the spins and parities of the exotic states , theoretical works are concentrated on studies of their internal quark - gluon structure , on new models and methods suggested for their exploration ( for details of theoretical and experimental studies see , the reviews @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the charmonium - like resonances of the xyz family contain , as it is evident from their names , a @xmath17 component .",
    "therefore , efforts were done to explain the new resonances as excitations of the ordinary @xmath18 charmonium . indeed ,",
    "some of new particles allow such interpretation , and are really excited @xmath18 states .",
    "but the essential part of the relevant experimental data can not be included into the exited charmonium scheme , and hence for their exploration unconventional quark - gluon configurations are needed .",
    "for this purpose , various models with different quark - gluon structures were supposed .",
    "the tetraquark model of the exotic states , i.e. the model that considers exotics as the four - quark particles , is among mostly employed ones .",
    "it is worth to note that this approach led to significant achievements in describing of the processes with the exotic states , in predicting their masses , decay widths and quantum numbers .",
    "there are some alternatives to compose from the four quarks an exotic state within the tetraquark model .",
    "in fact , the four constituent quarks may group into a diquark and an antidiquark to form the exotic state with required quantum numbers .",
    "this model is known as the diquark - antidiquark model . in the meson molecule picture",
    "the quarks are collected into two conventional mesons , and the exotic particle appears as loosely - bound molecule state .",
    "there are other opportunities to organize the exotic states from the four quarks , as well as alternative models , for an example , the hybrid models detailed presentation of which is beyond the scope of the present work .    in the tetraquark model",
    "the maximal number of the quark flavors in the xyz states does not exceed three .",
    "but there are not any fundamental laws in qcd forbidding the existence of the exotic states built of four quarks of distinct flavors .",
    "namely such exotic states recently became the objects of comprehensive theoretical investigations .",
    "but before going into details of these studies , we have to make some comments on the experimental situation formed around one of such particles .",
    "strictly speaking , all present theoretical activity was inspired by the d0 collaboration s report , where an evidence for existence of the exotic state @xmath19 was announced @xcite .",
    "based on analysis of @xmath20 collision data at @xmath21 collected at the fermilab tevatron collider , the collaboration reported on evidence of a narrow resonance @xmath19 in the consecutive decays @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 . from the decay channel @xmath26 it is easy to conclude that the state @xmath19 consists of valence @xmath27 and @xmath28 quarks .",
    "the mass of this state is equal to @xmath29 , and decay width is estimated as @xmath30 .",
    "the d0 assigned to this particle the quantum numbers @xmath31 , but did not exclude also a possible version @xmath32 .",
    "few days later the lhcb collaboration presented preliminary results of their analysis of @xmath15 collision data at energies @xmath33 and @xmath34 collected at cern @xcite .",
    "the lhcb collaboration could not confirm the existence of the resonance structure in the @xmath35 invariant mass distribution at the energies less than @xmath36 .",
    "in other words , situation with the exotic state @xmath37 , supposedly built of four different quark flavors is controversial and necessitates further experimental studies .",
    "the exotic state dubbed @xmath37 deserves to be searched for by other collaborations , and maybe , in other hadronic processes .",
    "namely these unclear circumstances surrounding the @xmath19 resonance make relevant theoretical studies even more important than just after the information on its existence .",
    "first suggestions concerning the diquark - antidiquark or meson molecule model for organization of the new state were made in ref .",
    "calculations performed until now covered only some topics of the @xmath19 physics .",
    "they include mainly computation of the mass , decay constant of @xmath19 ; a few works were devoted to calculation of the width of the @xmath22 decay , as well .",
    "it should be emphasized that the diquark - antidiquark model with @xmath31 prevails among approaches used to explain parameters of the @xmath37 state .",
    "thus , in ref .",
    "@xcite we accepted for this state the diquark - antidiquark structure @xmath4[\\bar{b}\\bar{d}]$ ] with the quantum numbers @xmath38 , and calculated its mass @xmath39 and decay constant ( i.e. the meson - current coupling ) @xmath40 .",
    "our prediction for @xmath39 agrees with the mass of the @xmath19 resonance found by the d0 collaboration . in the framework of the diquark - antidiquark model",
    "some parameters of @xmath19 were also analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where an alternative choice for the diquark - antidiquark type interpolating current was realized .",
    "the values for @xmath41 obtained in these works agree with each other , and are consistent with the experimental data of d0 collaboration .    employing the same @xmath42 structure and interpolating current as in our previous work , in ref .",
    "@xcite we computed the width of the @xmath43 decay channel .",
    "we applied qcd sum rule on the light - cone supplemented by the soft - meson approximation ( see , ref .",
    "agaev:2016dev ) : our result for @xmath44 describes correctly the experimental data .",
    "the width of the decay channels @xmath45 was also calculated in refs .",
    "dias:2016dme , wang:2016wkj using the three - point qcd sum rule approach . in these works",
    "authors found a very nice agreement between the theoretical predictions for @xmath46 and the data .",
    "the @xmath19 can also be considered as a meson molecule ; namely this picture was realized in refs .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath37 was treating as the @xmath47 bound state .",
    "it is worth to note that , in accordance with ref .",
    "@xcite , the mass of such molecule - like state was found equal to @xmath48 .",
    "a charmed partner of the @xmath42 state , i.e. the @xmath49 structure built of the valence @xmath50 and @xmath28 quarks and possessing the quantum numbers @xmath51 was analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here , we computed the mass , decay constant and width of the decays @xmath52 and @xmath53 considering @xmath5[\\bar{c}\\bar{d}]$ ] as the diquark - antidiquark state and employing two forms for the interpolating currents .",
    "the questions of quark - antiquark organization of @xmath42 and its partners were also addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the contradictory information by the d0 and lhcb collaborations concerning existence of the @xmath42 state resulted in an appearance of interesting theoretical works devoted to analysis of the @xmath42 physics , where its structure and spectroscopic parameters , production mechanisms were investigated . for details and further explanations",
    "we refer to original papers he:2016yhd , jin:2016cpv , stancu:2016sfd , burns:2016gvy , tang:2016pcf , guo:2016nhb , lu:2016zhe , esposito:2016itg , albaladejo:2016eps , ali:2016gdg .    in the present work we explore the strong vertices",
    "@xmath54 and @xmath55 , and calculate the couplings @xmath6 and @xmath7 by employing the qcd light - cone sum rule ( lcsr ) approach , which is one of the powerful nonperturbative methods in hadron physics enabling us to evaluate parameters of the particles and processes @xcite . within this approach one expresses the relevant correlation functions as convolution integrals of the perturbatively calculable coefficients and non - local matrix elements , which are the distribution amplitudes ( das ) of the particles under consideration .",
    "it is worth noting , that expansion in terms of non - local matrix elements cures shortcomings of the local expansion used in the conventional qcd sum rules .",
    "strictly speaking , the light cone expansion was already applied for investigation of the exotic states .",
    "indeed , in order to study strong vertices involving the exotic states , and calculate corresponding couplings and decay widths in refs .",
    "@xcite we applied a technique of the light cone calculations and obtained very good results , which agree with available experimental data and predictions of other theoretical works .",
    "but because of the differences in the quark contents of the conventional and exotic mesons , in those works we had to supply the light cone expansion by the soft - meson approximation ; the latter reduces the light cone expansion to the expansion in terms of local matrix elements weakening effects and advantages of the lcsr .    in the present work",
    "we employ the full version of the lcsr method in computation of the strong vertex composed of the exotic particles .",
    "this method previously was applied to analyze numerous vertices of conventional mesons and baryons , and calculate corresponding couplings , form factors .",
    "here we are able to cite only some of the works devoted to this interesting topic of hadron physics @xcite noting among them ref .",

    ", the present work is the first attempt to investigate the strong vertex of tetraquarks by employing the full version of qcd lcsr method . therefore , it is instructive to reveal possible technical problems hidden behind such kind of calculations , and elaborate schemes and methods to evade them",
