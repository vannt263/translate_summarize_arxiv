    "many approaches have been made to characterize the clustering of galaxies , especially over the past decade as better and deeper redshift surveys have become available ( cf . , borgani 1995 ; strauss & willick 1995 , for comprehensive reviews ) . the two - point correlation function and its fourier transform , the power spectrum ,",
    "the long popular methods for describing the clustering of galaxies , are complete statistical descriptions of the density field only if the phases of the fourier modes of the density field are random . indeed ,",
    "simple inflationary models predict these random phases ; if this condition holds , the one - point probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the density field @xmath10 is gaussian .",
    "as perturbations grow by gravitational instability , an initially gaussian distribution remains gaussian as long as the fluctuations remain in the linear regime .",
    "however , once non - linear effects become important , the distribution deviates from its initial gaussian state , and one needs higher order statistics to characterize the density field .    for a zero - mean gaussian distribution all reduced moments ( cumulants ) of the pdf are zero except the variance ( @xmath11 ) , hence non - zero skewness @xmath12 , kurtosis @xmath13 , and higher order cumulants are measures of the deviation of the distribution from a gaussian . in this paper , we only consider the first two lowest order effects , the skewness and the kurtosis .",
    "these @xmath9th - order cumulants are equal to the volume averaged correlation functions , @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and so forth . here",
    "the volume @xmath18 over which the @xmath19 are averaged is defined by the smoothing scale of the density field @xmath20 .    the assumption of scale invariance by balian & schaeffer ( 1988 , 1989 ) , @xmath21 yields the scaling relation , @xmath22 where the @xmath23 are independent of scale .",
    "the scale invariance of @xmath23 and the scaling relation ( [ eq : scaling ] ) are in fact predicted by perturbation theory in the mildly non - linear regime , under the two assumptions of gaussian initial conditions and growth of conditions via gravitational instability ( fry 1984ab , bernardeau 1992 ) .",
    "thus one can test the scale - invariance model by measuring the dependence of @xmath23 on smoothing scale , although it can be difficult in practice to rule out non - gaussian models ( fry & scherrer 1994 ; bouchet _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) .    calculation of @xmath23 from gravitational instability invokes @xmath24th order perturbation theory .",
    "bernardeau ( 1994b ) presents a method for calculating @xmath23 for top - hat filters ; the results are : @xmath25 and @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the spectral slope of the power spectrum ; a pure power - law spectrum is assumed .",
    "the expressions above are for @xmath28 ; while the @xmath23 are sensitive to the slope of the power spectrum , the dependence on @xmath29 is quite weak ( bouchet _ et al . _  1992 ; 1995 )",
    "these , and the corresponding results for a gaussian filter have been confirmed with @xmath9-body simulations ( juszkiewicz , bouchet , & colombi 1993 ; bernardeau 1994b ; okas _ et al . _  1995",
    "; juszkiewicz _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) . on the observational side ,",
    "calculations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 have been done for the cfa ( huchra _ et al . _  1983 ) and ssrs ( da costa _ et al . _",
    "1991 ) catalogs by gaztaaga ( 1992 ) and fry & gaztaaga ( 1994 ) , and on the _ iras _  1.2 jy sample ( fisher _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) by bouchet _",
    "et al . _  ( 1993 , hereafter b93 ) .",
    "calculations of higher order angular moments have been done for the lick galaxy counts ( szapudi , szalay , & boschan 1992 ) , _ iras _  galaxies ( meiksin , szapudi , & szalay 1992 ) , the apm galaxy survey ( gaztaaga 1994 , 1995 ; szapudi _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) , and the edsgc ( szapudi , meiksin , & nichol 1996 ) .",
    "for optically selected galaxies , gaztaaga ( 1992 ) found that @xmath30 up to a smoothing scale of @xmath31 22 @xmath3 mpc , which is slightly higher than the value found by b93 for the _ iras _  sample : @xmath32 .",
    "the standard technique to measure @xmath0 and @xmath1 from observational data involves calculation of the moments of the count probability distribution function ( cpdf ) , while the cpdf is the distribution function of the discretely sampled galaxy distribution . ]",
    "(   [ sec : moments ] ) , which in turn is determined via counts in cells .",
    "the high - order moments of the cpdf are of course weighted heavily by its high density tail . regions of such high density are rare , so these moments are highly sensitive to the presence or absence of a few clusters ( colombi , bouchet , & schaeffer 1994 , 1995 ; szapudi & szalay 1996 ) .",
    "also , in a finite volume , there is always a densest region , and thus the cpdf goes to zero for higher densities .",
    "not taking this finite - volume effect into account will cause the clustering amplitudes to be systematically underestimated .",
    "the cpdf asymptotes to an exponential at high densities , especially in the strongly non - linear regime ( balian & schaeffer 1989 ) ; one can thus extrapolate the observed cpdf to arbitrarily high densities .",
    "thus one can obtain unbiased estimates of the high - order moments , _ if the volume is large and dense enough to reach this asymptotic regime , to allow the exponential to be fit _",
    "( fry & gaztaaga 1994 ; colombi _ et al . _  1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "this exponential asymptotic behaviour is not expected for the weak regime , making it difficult to correct for finite - volume effects ( cf . , the discussion in b93 ) .",
    "finally , the tail of the distribution is also affected by _",
    "finite - sampling _ effects ; it can be underestimated if the cpdf is determined from too few spheres ( szapudi & colombi 1996 ) .",
    "however , as we shall see , skewness and kurtosis affect the entire cpdf , not just the tails . in particular , skewness causes the mode of the distribution ( the region where the measured cpdf is most robust ) to shift from the mean .",
    "this motivates us to develop a new method to measure the @xmath23 from the cpdf , less sensitive to finite volume effects , by fitting the entire cpdf to a functional form .",
    "there are several approaches to calculating the evolution of the pdf of @xmath20 from gaussian initial conditions , using the zeldovich ( 1970 ) approximation ( kofman _ et al .",
    "_  1994 ) or eulerian perturbation theory ( bernardeau 1992 ; bernardeau & kofman 1995 ; colombi _ et al._1997 ) . the so - called edgeworth expansion , which provides a convenient parametric form to account for small deviations from gaussianity , gives an excellent fit to the pdf of @xmath20 in @xmath9-body models for small @xmath33 ( juszkiewicz _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) . in this paper , we take the edgeworth expansion convolved with a poisson distribution as our model , and perform a maximum likelihood fit with respect to the free parameters @xmath23 to the observed cpdf of the _ iras _  1.2 jy survey from b93 .",
    "we expect this method to be more robust than direct calculation of the moments , since it depends more on the overall shape of the distribution function than on the high - density tail region .",
    "although there are several applications of the edgeworth expansion to measure non - gaussian statistics of the density field in the literature ( scherrer & bertschinger 1991 ; amendola 1994 ; juszkiewicz _ et al._1995 ) , it has not yet been applied to observational data .",
    "we check the validity of our technique by applying it to _ iras _  mock catalogs taken from @xmath9-body simulations , and compare the results with the predicted value of @xmath0 and @xmath1 from perturbation theory , and with values measured from the moments of the pdf .    in  2",
    "we give a brief account of the moments method , and describe our model based on the edgeworth expansion .",
    "we test this method with @xmath9-body simulations in  3 . in  4 , we apply our method to the _ iras _  1.2 jy cpdf and compare our results with those of the moments method and perturbation theory .",
    "we summarize our results in  5 .",
    "the cpdf @xmath34 is defined as the fraction of randomly positioned spheres of radius @xmath35 containing exactly @xmath9 galaxies for a given volume - limited galaxy sample . here",
    "we use the cpdf of _ iras _  galaxies from 10 volume - limited subsamples as calculated by b93 ( see their table 1 ) .",
    "we place @xmath36 random points in each subsample and count the number of galaxies in concentric spheres of different radii @xmath35 , from each point , considering only those spheres that are completely included within the subsamples ( see b93 for details ) .",

    "these calculations were done by b93 for the _ iras _  redshift survey , and it was found that the scaling relation ( equation  [ eq : scaling ] ) indeed holds very well ( see figure  8 of b93 ) .",
    "a fit of the data to @xmath42 , gives @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where scale invariance predicts @xmath45 ( equation  [ eq : scaling ] ) .",
    "all calculations are done in redshift space , but the @xmath23 are quite insensitive to redshift space distortions , at least on mildly non - linear scales ( bouchet _ et al._1992 ; lahav _ et al . _  1993 ; fry & gaztaaga 1994 ; hivon _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) . as mentioned in the previous section , no correction for finite - volume or finite - sampling effects",
    "have been carried out for these data .",
    "the primordial density fluctuations are assumed to be gaussian distributed , and as these fluctuations grow by gravitational instability , the pdf of @xmath20 deviates away from its initial gaussian form , generating non - zero higher order moments . to the extent that the deviations from a gaussian are small",
    ", it makes sense to write the pdf as an expansion around a gaussian .",
    "the edgeworth expansion is a rigorous way to do this , as described by juszkiewicz _",
    "et al . _  ( 1995 ) .",
    "we expand the pdf , here denoted by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , in terms of a gaussian @xmath49 and its derivatives .",

    "@xmath52 therefore the first few coefficients of equation  ( [ eq : gram - charlier ] ) are given by : @xmath53 where the @xmath54 are the normalized cumulants defined in equation  ( [ eq : scaling ] ) .",
    "a reordering of the terms of the gram - charlier series gives a proper asymptotic expansion in @xmath33 , the edgeworth series : @xmath55 \\sigma^2 + { \\cal o}(\\sigma^3 ) \\right\\}.       \\label{eq : fullew}\\ ] ]      equation  ( [ eq : fullew ] ) is a model for the underlying density distribution from which the galaxies are sampled , but it does not yet account for the discreteness of the galaxies .",
    "due to the finite number of galaxies in each sample , the observed cpdf is subject to poisson noise , and we take this effect into account by convolving the edgeworth expansion with a poisson distribution ( cf . , coles & jones 1991 ) .",
    "we define the density contrast as @xmath56 .",
    "let us rewrite the edgeworth expansion to third order ( second order in @xmath33 ) as a function of @xmath20 , @xmath57 \\sigma^2           \\right\\}.                          \\label{eq : edelta3}\\ ] ] the expectation value of @xmath58 at a given value of @xmath35 is given by the convolution of equation  ( [ eq : edelta3 ] ) with a poisson distribution , @xmath59 where the poisson distribution is @xmath60 the conditional probability of finding @xmath9 points in a sphere when the true overdensity in that sphere is @xmath61 .",
    "the edgeworth expansion is not positive definite ; moreover , for values of @xmath33 approaching unity , it shows unphysical oscillations ( juszkiewicz _ et al . _  1995",
    "; ueda & yokoyama 1996 ) .",
    "however , when we convolve it with a poisson distribution , the edgeworth expansion becomes much better behaved .",
    "figure  [ fig : underlying ] illustrates this with the observed cpdf for a volume - limited sample of _ iras_galaxies ( points ) .",
    "the cpdf is normalized to the total number of spheres which fill the volume , @xmath62 ( equation  [ eq : m - def ] ) , and the error bars are given by poisson statistics , i.e. , the square root of the value of the cpdf .",
    "the solid curve is the best fit of the model in equation  ( [ eq : convolve ] ) ( using the method described below ) , while the dashed curve shows the underlying edgeworth expansion ( equation  [ eq : edelta3 ] ) with the same values of @xmath33 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 .",
    "the dashed line goes negative and oscillates around the cpdf , while the solid line traces it nearly perfectly .",
    "this example has @xmath63 .",
    "the dotted line is the result of performing a fit of the edgeworth expansion with no poisson noise term included .",
    "not surprisingly , the @xmath33 is overestimated , and the model gives a very poor fit .",
    "thus for the sparse _ iras _  data we use in this paper , the poisson noise term is absolutely essential in our model for the cpdf .",
    "note that the edgeworth expansion is no longer valid for @xmath64 , and thus the example in figure  [ fig : underlying ] represents the smallest scales on which we will apply it .",
    "the observed cpdf , @xmath58 , and the model , @xmath65 , are defined to be the _ probability _ that a sphere of size @xmath35 contains @xmath9 points .",
    "when we assume that a total of @xmath62 spheres are placed randomly within the volume , then the _ number _ of spheres that contain exactly @xmath9 points is @xmath66 ; we similarly define @xmath67 .",
    "we would like @xmath62 to represent the number of _ statistically independent _ spheres , in order to allow us to define error bars on the observed @xmath58 , but it is not clear _ a priori _ how to measure this .",
    "the number of spheres thrown within the volume , @xmath36 , is clearly an overestimate for @xmath62 , due to severe overlap between spheres may in fact be too _ small _ a number of spheres to avoid finite - sampling effects in the tails of the distribution ; cf .",

    ". however , we argue below that the edgeworth method is insensitive to such biases in the tail . ] .",
    "one possibility , which is used to define errorbars in figures  [ fig : underlying ] and [ fig:4datafits ] , is to take @xmath68 the ratio of the volumes of the sample and the sphere , and accordingly @xmath69 , are not integers . ]",
    "; here @xmath70 is the radius of the subsample , and @xmath71 is the solid angle it subtends .",
    "however , gaztaaga & yokoyama ( 1993 ) show ( as we confirm in   [ sec : errors ] ) that this is an underestimate , and suggest multiplying equation  ( [ eq : m - def ] ) by @xmath72 ( which is much larger than unity on large scales ) . this issue is further discussed in szapudi & colombi ( 1996 ) and szapudi _",
    "_  ( 1996 ) .",
    "we do not have a rigorous solution to this problem .",
    "our approach for the present paper is to use the value of @xmath62 given by equation  ( [ eq : m - def ] ) , demonstrate directly that it is an underestimate , and , in the following subsection , suggest an empirical rescaling to allow us to define error bars on measured quantities .",
    "as explained above , we throw @xmath36 spheres in each volume to measure @xmath58 .",
    "this is multiplied by @xmath62 , which is several orders of magnitude lower than @xmath36 , to obtain @xmath73 .",
    "we assume that this _ number _ of spheres @xmath73 is poissonian distributed around the true value @xmath74 , so the likelihood of each observed data point @xmath73 is given by the poisson distribution .",
    "we assume that the values of @xmath69 are statistically independent ( we will see in the following subsection that these assumptions appear to be violated , but that we can make a heuristic fix to the likelihood ) .",
    "we therefore can express the likelihood function of the observed cpdf as the product of these quantities over @xmath9 , @xmath75 in practice , the product extends only over those values of @xmath9 for which @xmath76 , as the poisson model breaks down beyond that .",
    "nevertheless , we will see that in many cases the best fitting curve continues to trace the cpdf reasonably well even when @xmath77 ( cf .",
    "the right - hand panels of figure  [ fig:4datafits ] ) . we have assumed a poisson distribution in @xmath73 ; if we had assumed a gaussian distribution , our likelihood function could be expressed in terms of @xmath78 . here , the quantity corresponding to @xmath78 is then : @xmath79 ,         \\label{eq : chisquared}\\ ] ] and we minimize this quantity instead of maximizing @xmath80 ( equation  [ eq : likelihood ] ) .",
    "we use powell s method ( press _ et al._1992 ) to minimize @xmath81 with respect to @xmath82 ; indeed , we do fits to first order ( i.e. , gaussian ) , second order ( including the term proportional to @xmath83 ) and third order in the edgeworth expansion ( equation  [ eq : edelta3 ] ) , although we focus mainly on the third - order fit in this paper . to avoid having the code settle into a local minimum , we start the search with reasonable values of the parameters , i.e. , those we calculate by the moments method . in most cases",
    "this converges to a fair estimate of the parameters , but in some cases , especially on large scales , where the higher order correlations are intrinsically weak , or when the volume of the subsample is very large and hence the density of the galaxies are small , calculating the moments yields negative quantities of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "when this happens , we set the initial values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 to zero instead , and minimize @xmath81 again .",
    "maximum likelihood fits of first , second and third order to the _ iras_cpdf s for representative values of @xmath70 and @xmath35 are given in table  2 ; those with asterisks are plotted in figure  [ fig:4datafits ] .",
    "the left panels of the figure give @xmath73 on a linear scale to show the fit around the peak clearly .",
    "the right panels are log plots to show the tail region in detail .",
    "the error bars are again given by poisson statistics as in figure  [ fig : underlying ] .",
    "the solid line is the first order ( gaussian ) fit , and the dotted line and the short dashed line represent second and third order fits respectively .",
    "the second and third order fits are a remarkable improvement over the initial set of parameters obtained by the moments method , represented by the long dashed lines .",
    "the third order fits , with the term proportional to @xmath84 included , are an improvement over the second order fits . note in particular that the third - order fits follow the observed cpdf even into the region where @xmath85 , which is not even included in the fitting procedure . on the other hand , quite interestingly , the third order model with the parameters given by the moments method ( long dashes ) usually does the best job of fitting the high - density tail of the cpdf , although this fit is poor at intermediate to low @xmath20 .",
    "this again reflects the sensitivity of the moments method to the tails of the distribution . as the volume of the subsample increases , going downward in the figure , the gaussian fit becomes a better approximation to the observed cpdf .",
    "indeed , for the bottom - most panel with a subsample of volume 176 @xmath3 mpcand a smoothing length of 31.54 @xmath3 mpc , the first , second , and third order fits are barely distinguishable .",
    "this is a result of two effects .",
    "first , the larger the subsample is , the sparser the sample becomes , and therefore the poisson noise dominates the cpdf , swamping the higher order correlations .",
    "second , the larger the smoothing scale , the weaker the higher order correlations become , because clustering is weaker at larger scales .",
    "therefore in either of these cases , the accuracies of the higher order correlation terms , @xmath0 and especially @xmath1 , drop appreciably , and the error bars we derive for these quantities in the next section are therefore quite large .",
    "we determine errors on the parameters from the inverse of the hessian matrix of the likelihood function .",
    "close to the minimum , we expect the likelihood function to be well approximated by a quadratic form , @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the vector of parameters , and @xmath88 is the value of this vector at the minimum value of @xmath89",
    ". here @xmath90 , the hessian matrix , is the second derivative matrix of @xmath81 .",
    "since the form of the likelihood function is given , the hessian matrix is known to us .",
    "the covariance matrix is then obtained by @xmath91 \\equiv 2\\,{\\bf d}^{-1}\\ ] ] and @xmath92 are the @xmath93 confidence intervals of the parameters @xmath94 .",
    "the values of the errors derived in this way are of course critically dependent on the value of @xmath62 assumed .",
    "the third - order model fits the points in figures  [ fig : underlying ] and [ fig:4datafits ] much too well , given the poisson errors shown , suggesting that our value of @xmath62 is underestimated .",
    "we can quantify this with a @xmath78 statistic : @xmath95 where poisson error bars are assumed , and the sum is over only the @xmath96 values of @xmath9 for which @xmath97 ( such that the correspondence between the poisson distribution , and the gaussian distribution assumed in equation  ( [ eq : chi2 ] ) , is valid ) .",
    "this quantity is less than the number of degrees of freedom @xmath98 by factors of as much as ten . as we discussed in the previous subsection ,",
    "it is not clear how to set @xmath62 _ a priori _ , and consequently the errors on @xmath58 and parameters derived from it ( cf .",
    ", the exhaustive discussion in szapudi & colombi 1996 for the strongly non - linear regime ; there does not yet exist a complete theory for the errors in the weakly nonlinear regime ) .",
    "we find that the gaztaaga & yokoyama ( 1993 ) suggestion of multiplying @xmath62 by @xmath72 does not bring @xmath99 to unity , although it does go in the right direction .",
    "our approach is an empirical one : we _ scale _ our errors of @xmath69 to force @xmath100 ; equivalently , we multiply the errors in @xmath33 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 derived above by @xmath101 .",
    "this is done _ a posteriori _ , and so does not affect the best - fit values of the parameters , but it does of course have a strong effect on the derived errors .",
    "this is not a statistically rigorous procedure , but we will justify these errors empirically in the next section .",
    "the @xmath102 errors determined in this way are included in table  2 .",
    "table  2 includes the values of @xmath89 for each fit ; these have been scaled by the factor @xmath99 .",
    "this way one can quantify the goodness of fit of the curves seen in figure  [ fig:4datafits ] by comparing the relative likelihoods .",
    "the lower the value of @xmath81 , the better the fit becomes for given values of @xmath70 and @xmath35 ; a difference of unity is significant at the 1@xmath103 level .",
    "these values of @xmath81 are not comparable across subsamples or smoothing scales , since in each case the input cpdf is different .",
    "to check the validity of our method , we generate _ iras _  mock catalogs from the @xmath9-body simulations of protogeros & weinberg ( 1997 ) , kindly given to us by d. weinberg .",
    "these assume an initial power spectrum @xmath104 , and @xmath105 , and are evolved forward to the point when @xmath106 , the rms fluctuation amplitude within an 8 @xmath3 mpc  sphere , is equal to 0.8 .",

    "we compute the cpdf for these samples with tophat filters of the same radii as are used in the real universe , and fit these to our edgeworth model exactly as was done above .",

    "we conclude that our method gives unbiased estimates of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , while the moments method is systematically biased low for sparse samples by finite - volume effects , which can not easily be corrected for .",
    "the last test we perform on @xmath9-body simulations is to check the estimation of our error bars , via the method explained in ",
    "[ sec : errors ] . for several specific values of sample size @xmath70 and smoothing scale @xmath35",
    ", we draw a series of 50 mock catalogs randomly from the simulation , compute @xmath69 for each , and fit them to find @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and their estimated errors , in each case .",
    "we found in every case that the mean of the estimated errors agreed with the standard deviation of the individual values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 to within 10% , implying that the error estimates are correct in the mean .",
    "of course , this only works when we scale @xmath81 by the ratio of @xmath78 to the number of degrees of freedom , as discussed in   [ sec : errors ] ; if we do not do this , our errors are overestimated by factors of 2 or 3 .",
    "however , we emphasize here that our error estimation is not done in a rigorous way ; our approach in ",
    "[ sec : errors ] is empirical at best , and further tests of our errors with simulations with a variety of power spectra are needed to justify these errors fully .",
    "table 2 shows that the best - fit values of @xmath33 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are often considerably different from those found by the moments method .",
    "figure  [ fig : lsigma ] shows @xmath121 versus the smoothing scale @xmath35 , for the values found in the third order edgeworth expansion fit .",
    "the upper panel shows all cases separately , with different symbols representing different sample sizes and lines connecting the points found within each subsample .",
    "as the size @xmath70 of the subsample increases , @xmath122 grows for any given @xmath35 ; more luminous galaxies show stronger clustering than do less luminous galaxies ( b93 ) .",
    "this luminosity effect agrees well with that of the moments method quantified in b93 .",
    "however , within each subsample the values trace a power law reasonably well , as does the weighted average given by the squares in the lower panel .",
    "the dotted line in the lower panel is a least square fit to a power law .",
    "the average of the slopes at each value of @xmath70 is @xmath123 , crossing unity at an average value of @xmath124 , while the moments method ( triangles in the lower panel ) yields @xmath125 ( b93 ) .",
    "this is quite reassuring , considering the sensitivity of @xmath33 to the order of the fit ( table  2 ) .",
    "the large error bar in @xmath126 is due to its sensitivity on luminosity .",
    "the weighted average values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 found by fitting the third order edgeworth expansion are summarized in tables  3 ( averaging at a given sample size @xmath70 ) and 4 ( averaging at a given scale @xmath35 ) , and are plotted in figures  [ fig : rs3 ] , [ fig : ls3 ] , and [ fig : ls4 ] .",
    "note that our likelihood method gives meaningful error bars on the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , enabling us to perform a weighted average of our determinations on different scales and from different subsamples , assuming that they are independent of scale .",
    "the figures also show results for the moments method .",
    "they are systematically lower than the edgeworth results , due to finite - volume effects . as with the @xmath9-body tests",
    "described in the previous subsection , we found that on these large scales , the cpdf never reached the asymptotic form that would allow us to correct for these effects ( compare with fry & gaztaaga 1994 , who did perform this correction , but only on scales below 10@xmath127mpc ) .",
    "error bars for values determined from the moments method can be calculated ( szapudi & colombi 1996 ) , but are quite complicated . following b93 , we use the standard deviation of determinations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as our error bar for the moments method , including only positive values .",
    "the edgeworth approximation yields values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( open squares in figures  [ fig : rs3 ] , [ fig : ls3 ] , and [ fig : ls4 ] ) which show no statistically significant dependence on @xmath70 or @xmath35 , consistent with the scale - invariant hypothesis ( cf . , discussion below ) . without finite - volume corrections ,",
    "this scale - invariance is not apparent from the moments results .",
    "this is not an issue with the edgeworth method ; it is quite insensitive to the tail of the cpdf , and thus no correction for finite - volume effects is needed .",
    "we find a global average of @xmath128 , which is appreciably larger than the value @xmath129 found in b93 .",
    "this is consistent with the bias in the moments method we found in   [ sec : nbodytest ] ; we showed there that the edgeworth method is unbiased , and we therefore believe that our determination of @xmath130 for _ iras _  galaxies supersedes that of b93 .",
    "our results are in better agreement with the moments methods results for _ iras_from fry & gaztaaga ( 1994 ) , which found @xmath131 , in the range 3 - 10@xmath127mpc , and meiksin _",
    "et al._(1992 ) from the angular distribution of _ iras _  galaxies ( @xmath132 in the range 4 - 10@xmath127mpc ) to be identical ( cf .",
    ", bernardeau 1995 ) . ] .",
    "our result uses the third - order edgeworth expansion ; if we use the second - order expansion , we find @xmath133 , which is consistent with the value from the third order fit . in both cases ,",
    "the average is dominated by the point with the smallest errors , @xmath134 at 8@xmath127mpc .    given the estimated errors on @xmath0 for each value of @xmath70 and @xmath35",
    ", we can do an _ a posteriori _ test of the hypothesis that @xmath0 is independent of sample , by computing the @xmath78-like statistic : @xmath135 where the sum is over all different values of @xmath70 and @xmath35 .",
    "we find that @xmath136 exceeds the number of measurements of @xmath0 by a factor of two .",
    "this is due to several effects : cosmic variance , the approximation we have made that the errors in @xmath0 determined at different scales from the same data are statistically independent , and possible real scale - dependence of @xmath0 caused by higher - order effects ( cf . , colombi _ et al . _  1996",
    "our final error bar should reflect this increased scatter , and so we multiply the error on @xmath137 by @xmath138 , yielding @xmath139 .",
    "it would be interesting to separate out these effects with a @xmath140 simulation , in which these higher - order effects should be more important ( colombi _ et al . _",
    "1996 ) ; this is work for the future .",
    "figure  [ fig : ls4 ] shows the determination of @xmath1 as a function of scale . for scales larger than @xmath141 , @xmath1 becomes very uncertain , with large error bars .",
    "however , the weighted average values of @xmath1 in the bottom panel stay close to the total average value of @xmath142 , with error bars overlapping that value at all scales .",
    "we carried out the @xmath78 test of equation  ( [ eq : s3chi2 ] ) for @xmath1 as well , finding @xmath143 again .",
    "we thus also multiply our quoted error on @xmath144 by 1.4 , yielding @xmath145 .",
    "this again is larger than , albeit statistically consistent with , the moments method results of @xmath146 ( b93 ) , and is in agreement with meiksin _",
    "_  ( 1992 ) and fry & gaztaaga ( 1994 ) , quoted above .",
    "gaztaaga ( 1992 ) used the moments method to find @xmath147 for optically selected galaxies .",
    "gaztaaga ( 1992 ) and b93 claim that the lower value of @xmath0 for _ iras _  galaxies can be attributed to the underrepresentation of _ iras _  galaxies in dense cluster cores ( cf . , strauss _",
    "et al . _",
    "1992 ) . as a test of this , b93 gave extra weight to the _ iras _",
    "clusters to match the overdensities seen in optically selected galaxies ; they found the @xmath23 to be quite sensitive to this : @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "this demonstrates the high sensitivity of the moments method to dense clusters ; the moments are heavily weighted by the tail of the cpdf , and this effect is even more important for @xmath1 than for @xmath0 .",
    "this sensitivity is very dangerous , given the fact that the tail is generally hard to measure with accuracy , as we have seen .",
    "we have fit the edgeworth model to the cpdf of these cluster - boosted counts , and found @xmath150 , @xmath151 , within 2 standard deviations of the unboosted results above .",
    "this is as expected ; boosting the clusters only affects the cpdf in the tail , and therefore this has only a small effect on our fits .    one might argue that this result is misleading ; if our edgeworth model is a good fit to the full cpdf before the cluster - boosting , it _ can not _ be a good fit afterwards , because the tail has changed dramatically , even though it had very little effect on the rest of the cpdf .",
    "clearly , the moments method and our method can not agree in both cases , independent of issues of finite volume effects . with our method , @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "are determined from a fit to that part of the cpdf that is close to mean density , and therefore is not highly non - linear , while the moments method is quite sensitive to the non - linear tail .",
    "thus our method can measure @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the weakly nonlinear regime , even when strong clustering is present .    the effective power - law index for _ iras _  galaxies is @xmath152 ( fisher _ et al . _",
    "1993 ) , which would predict that @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "why do our results differ from these values ? if the _",
    "iras_galaxy distribution were biased with respect to the underlying mass , one would expect that the skewness and kurtosis would be systematically affected . the linear bias model , @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the observed galaxy density field and @xmath157 is the underlying mass density contrast , predicts @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "however , as fry & gaztaaga ( 1993 ) point out , we can not consider high - order correlations without also considering the possibility of high - order bias ( gaztaaga & frieman 1994 ; juszkiewicz _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) : @xmath160 this leads to : @xmath161 thus without external information on the detailed form of the biasing relation , we can not make a direct comparison of our results with those from perturbation theory .",
    "we have measured the count probability distribution function via the counts - in - cells method for 10 volume limited subsamples of the _ iras_1.2 jy redshift survey , exactly as in b93 .",
    "there are various approaches to measure the skewness @xmath0 and kurtosis @xmath1 of the probability distribution function of the underlying density field .",
    "b93 calculated these quantities for this sample using the moments method .",
    "they found scale invariance of @xmath0 to @xmath162 @xmath3 mpc , with an average value of @xmath32 .",
    "however , the moments method is very sensitive to the high density tail of the cpdf , making the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 sensitive to finite - volume and finite - sampling effects .",
    "these effects can be corrected for ( fry & gaztaaga 1994 ; colombi _ et al . _  1995",
    "; szapudi & colombi 1996 ; szapudi _ et al . _",
    "1996 ) , at least in the strongly non - linear regime with dense sampling .",
    "we work here with a very sparse redshift survey in the weakly non - linear region ( @xmath163 ) , and find that the cpdf never properly reaches the asymptotic limit that allows one to correct for finite - volume effects .",
    "we propose a method less sensitive to the tails of the cpdf , a maximum likelihood fit of the edgeworth expansion convolved with a poissonian , to the observed cpdf .",
    "the edgeworth expansion is valid only in the weakly nonlinear regime ( @xmath164 ) ; unlike the moments method , it can not be applied on very small scales .",
    "we have tested our method with _ iras _  mock catalogs extracted from @xmath9-body simulations ; we find that the derived values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are consistent with the analytic predictions from perturbation theory , as well as from the moments method as derived from densely sampled @xmath9-body points .",
    "moreover , our estimated errors are consistent with the scatter in @xmath0 and @xmath1 seen in multiple realizations of the sample .",
    "the results from the moments method in these sparse mock catalogs are systematically biased low , especially on large scales , due to finite - volume effects . hence we conclude that the edgeworth approximation is much more reliable and robust than is the moments method , especially in sparse samples and in the weakly non - linear regime , where there is no simple method to correct for these effects .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are found to be @xmath165 and @xmath6 , significantly higher than the results of b93 , but consistent with meiksin _",
    "et al . _  ( 1992 ) and fry & gaztaaga ( 1994 ) .",
    "these results are quite insensitive to the fact that _ iras _  galaxies are underrepresented in cluster cores .",
    "both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are independent of scale within the errors from 5 @xmath3mpc to 50 @xmath3mpc .",
    "we have shown that the data are consistent with the scale - invariant hypothesis .",
    "it would be very interesting to compare these results with those from various specific models with non - gaussian initial conditions , to see at what level we might be able to rule them out .",
    "application of the edgeworth approximation to optical samples should be interesting , especially since previous work has shown discrepancies with the _ iras _  sample , attributed to the underrepresentation of _ iras _  galaxies in clusters .",
    "also interesting would be to apply this technique to angular surveys such as the apm galaxy sample , where we could carry this technique out to appreciably higher order .",
    "we also look forward to applying this technique on the spectroscopic and photometric data of the sloan digital sky survey ( cf . , gunn & weinberg 1995 ) , which will allow us to probe appreciably larger spatial scales .",
    "there is also further work to be done on the method itself .",
    "our understanding of the errors and covariances in the cpdf , and therefore the errors in our derived parameters , is poor , and thus our final errors are not rigorously justified . as we have seen in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , the @xmath78 test ( equation  [ eq : s3chi2 ] ) suggests that our method of obtaining error bars can hide interesting higher order effects . in particular , without good _ a priori _ errors , we can not do a proper test of goodness of fit of our model . further analytical work in this direction",
    "is needed , together with more extensive tests with simulations over a wider range of conditions .",
