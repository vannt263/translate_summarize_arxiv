    "one of the most significant discovery in the string theory is the ads / cft correspondence @xcite which relates a weakly coupled gravity theory in @xmath1-dimensional ads spacetime to a strongly coupled conformal field theory living on the @xmath2-dimensional boundary .",
    "it is widely believed now that the ads / cft correspondence could provide a new means of studying the strongly interacting condensed matter systems in which the perturbative methods are no longer valid .",
    "thus , this holographic method is expected to give us some insights into the nature of the pairing mechanism in the high temperature superconductors which fall outside of the scope of current theories of superconductivity . in the pioneering papers @xcite ,",
    "it was suggested that the spontaneous @xmath3 symmetry breaking happened in the bulk black holes can be used to build gravitational duals of the transition from normal state to superconducting state in the boundary theory .",
    "this dual model consists of a system with a black hole and a charged scalar field , in which the black hole admits scalar hair at temperature @xmath4 smaller than a critical temperature @xmath5 .",
    "the appearance of a hairy ads black hole means the formation of the scalar condensation in the boundary cft , which indicates that the expectation value of charged operators undergoes the u(1 ) symmetry breaking and then the phase transition is occurred .",
    "it was argued that this phase transition belongs to the second order . due its potential applications to the condensed matter physics ,",
    "holographic superconductors in the various theories of gravity have been investigated in the recent years @xcite .",
    "recently , franco _",
    "@xcite investigated the general models of holographic superconductors in which the spontaneous breaking of a global u(1 ) symmetry occurs via the stckelberg mechanism .",
    "they found that both the order of the phase transition and the critical exponents for the second phase transition can be tuned by the parameters defined in the models .",
    "these generalized holographic superconductor models have also been extended recently to the gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite and born - infeld electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the properties of holographic superconductors depend on the coupling between the scalar field and the electromagnetic field .",
    "theoretically , the general form of the action with more couplings can be expressed as @xmath6,\\label{act2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are arbitrary functions of the corresponding variables , @xmath10 is the lagrangian for other matter fields . obviously , the nonlinear functions @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 provide the more non - minimal couplings among fields and the background spacetime . these new couplings",
    "modify the usual klein - gordon equation and einstein - maxwell equation so that the motion equations for the scalar field and electromagnet filed are no longer generally the second - order differential equations , which may changes the properties of holographic superconductors in the ads spacetime .",
    "recently , f. aprile _ et al . _",
    "@xcite considered a special case of the action ( [ act2 ] ) in which the system contains the couplings among a scalar field , electromagnetic field and the cosmological constant so that the action has a form @xmath11.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] they studied the properties of holographic superconductors and found that some aspects of the quantum critical behavior strongly depend on the choice of couplings @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "another interesting case is that the scalar field in the action ( [ act2 ] ) is kinetically coupling with einstein s tensor .",
    "sushkov found @xcite that the equation of motion for the scalar field can be reduced to second - order differential equation in this model , which means that the theory is a  good \" dynamical theory from the point of view of physics .",
    "the applications of this model to the cosmology has been done extensively in @xcite .",
    "it is found that in cosmology the problem of graceful exit from inflation with such a coupling has a natural solution without any fine - tuned potential .",
    "the dynamical behaviors and hawking radiation of a scalar field coupling to einstein s tensor in the background of a black hole spacetime have been studied in @xcite .",
    "it was showed that this coupling changes the stability of the black hole and enhances hawking radiation of the black hole .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to investigate the properties of holographic superconductors in the models in which a charged scalar field is kinetically coupling to einstein s tensor and probe the effects of such a coupling on physical quantities and on the dynamics of the phase transition .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we will study the scalar condensation and the phase transitions for a general class of the holographic superconductor models via the stckelberg mechanism as the charged scalar field is kinetically coupling to einstein s tensor . in sec .",
    "iii , we will probe the effects of the coupling parameter and other model parameters on the conductivity of the charged condensates .",
    "finally , we will conclude in the last section of our main results .",
    "we will consider the action of the scalar field coupling to the einstein s tensor @xmath15 in the ads background @xmath16,\\label{acts}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the coupling parameter .",
    "as in @xcite , re - scaling the charged scalar field @xmath19 with real @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and then the action ( [ acts ] ) can be re - written in a stckelberg form @xmath22,\\label{acts1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the gauge symmetry @xmath23 together with @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the generalized stckelberg lagrangian action in the non - minimal derivative coupling theory can be expressed as @xmath25.\\label{acts2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath26 is a function of @xmath20 , which is take as @xmath27 with the model parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xcite . in the probe limit ,",
    "the backreactions on the background metric from the matter field is negligible .",
    "here we adopt to such a limit so that we can neglect the influence of the coupling terms contained the factor @xmath31 in the action ( [ acts2 ] ) on the metric for simplicity .",
    "one of the most simple ads black hole is the planar schwarzschild ads black hole which can be described by a metric @xmath32 with @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the radius of ads and @xmath35 is the mass of black hole .",
    "the hawking temperature is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the event horizon of the black hole .",
    "the einstein s tensor @xmath15 in the schwarzschild ads black hole ( [ m1 ] ) has a form @xmath38 substituting eqs .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) and ( [ ein2 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ acts2 ] ) and taking the ansatz @xmath39 we can find that the equations of motion for the complex scalar field @xmath20 and electrical scalar potential @xmath40 can be written as @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively . here",
    "a prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath43 and we use the gauge freedom to fix @xmath44 .",
    "obviously , the presence of the coupling factor @xmath18 decreases the effective mass @xmath45 of the scalar field and increases the current of the electric field .",
    "this means that the coupling term will change the properties of holographic superconductors in the schwarzschild ads black hole . in order to solve the nonlinear equations ( [ emo1 ] ) and ( [ emo2 ] ) numerically , we need to seek the boundary condition for @xmath46 and @xmath20 near the black hole horizon @xmath47 and at the asymptotic ads boundary @xmath48 .",
    "the regularity condition at the horizon gives the boundary conditions @xmath49 and @xmath50 . at the asymptotic ads boundary @xmath48 , the scalar filed @xmath20 and the electric potential @xmath46 can be approximated as @xmath51 and @xmath52 with @xmath53 in the dual field theory , the constants @xmath54 and @xmath55 are interpreted as the chemical potential and charge density respectively . the coefficients @xmath56 and @xmath57 correspond to the vacuum expectation values of the condensate operators",
    "@xmath58 respectively .",
    "since both of the falloffs are normalizable for @xmath20 , one can impose the boundary condition that either @xmath56 or @xmath57 vanishes , which ensures that the theory is stable in the asymptotic ads region @xcite .",
    "the choices of the boundary condition @xmath59 or @xmath60 will not affect qualitatively our results .",
    "thus , we here set @xmath59 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 for convenience . in doing so",
    ", we can investigate the properties of the scalar condensate @xmath63 for fixed charge density by solving the equations of motion ( [ emo1 ] ) and ( [ emo2 ] ) numerically .",
    "let us now to study how the phase transition depends on the coupling parameter @xmath18 and the model coefficients @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the @xmath64 . in fig . 1 , we present the influence of the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath30 on the phase transition for fixed @xmath65 .",
    "we find that the coupling parameter @xmath18 and the model parameters @xmath30 have obvious different effects on the critical temperature . in the case",
    "@xmath66 , we find that only the second - order phase transition happens in the formation of scalar hair and the critical temperature does not depend on the coefficient @xmath30 .",
    "these properties of holographic superconductors are similar to that in the case in which the scalar field is not coupling with einstein s tensor .",
    "however , with the increase of the coupling parameter @xmath18 , the critical temperature decreases , which means that the coupling between the scalar field and einstein s tensor makes the formation of the scalar condensate more hardly .",
    "this property of the coupling parameter @xmath18 has not been observed elsewhere . for the @xmath67 ,",
    "it was argued that for the case @xmath68 the behavior of the scalar condensate means that the phase transition changes from the second order to the first order .",
