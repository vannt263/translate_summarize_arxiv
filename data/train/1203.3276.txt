    "supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite is one of the most promising candidates of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . in susy",
    ", the gauge couplings can unify at a high scale , which leads to a successful realization of grand unified theories .",
    "also , it can solve the gauge hierarchy problem and yield a dark matter candidate to explain the 23% of the energy density of the universe .",
    "however , the flavor sector of the minimal supersymmetric standard model can cause trouble due to the fact that susy breaking terms can induce large flavor changing neutral currents .",
    "the experimental constraints on flavor changing neutral currents require flavor degeneracy of the susy particles , especially for the first and second generations , if susy particles are lighter than around 2 - 3 tev  @xcite .    in order to solve the flavor problem",
    ", the simplest assumption is that the squark and slepton masses are unified , flavor diagonal , and degenerate in the mass basis of quarks and leptons .",
    "the minimal version of this picture is the minimal supergravity framework ( msugra )  @xcite , which is described by 4 parameters and a sign : the universal scalar mass , @xmath4 , the universal gaugino mass , @xmath5 , the universal triliner coupling , @xmath6 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs fields , @xmath7 , and the sign of the higgs mixing term , @xmath8 , in the superpotential .",
    "these parameters are specified at the grand unified scale @xmath9 . in this model , however , the renormalization group equation splits the third generation from the other two because of the large top yukawa coupling .",
    "the cabbibo - kobayashi - masukawa matrix then allows this model to have observable flavor violation involving the third generation , e.g. , the branching ratio of @xmath10 .    in the leptonic sector",
    ", the neutrino oscillation data suggest that we also have a neutrino mixing matrix , the maki - nakagawa - sakata - pontecorvo matrix  @xcite .",
    "the light neutrino masses are usually generated via the seesaw mechanism , involving heavy majorana masses for right - handed neutrinos , which are introduced as additions to the sm quarks and leptons .",
    "the precise seesaw formula for the light neutrino mass matrix with three generations is given by  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the dirac neutrino mass matrix and @xmath13 is the majorana matrix , which consists of three right - handed neutrinos ( @xmath14 ) that have masses at the scale @xmath15 corresponding to a new ( local ) @xmath16 symmetry .",
    "the neutrino mixing angles in such schemes would arise as a joint effect from two sources : ( i ) mixings among the right - handed neutrinos present in @xmath13 and ( ii ) mixings among different generations present in the dirac mass matrix @xmath12 .",
    "the ( physical ) neutrino oscillation angles will also receive contributions from mixings among the charged leptons .",
    "the neutrino flavor mixings induced by the seesaw mechanism ( as needed by oscillation data ) can generate lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) effects . within the sm ,",
    "extended minimally to accommodate the seesaw mechanism , such effects are extremely small in any process due to a power suppression factor @xmath17 , as required by the decoupling theorem . however , this situation is quite different if there is low energy susy .",
    "the suppression factor for lfv effects then becomes much weaker , taking the value @xmath18 .",
    "this can lead to observable lfv effects at low energies , as noted in a number of papers  @xcite .",
    "the main difference is that , with low energy susy , lfv can be induced in the slepton sector , which can then be transferred ( through one loop diagrams involving the exchange of gauginos ) to the leptons suppressed only by a factor @xmath18 .",
    "the experimental evidence for neutrino oscillation is thus a strong indicator that there might very well be lfv , assuming the validity of low energy susy .",
    "searches for lfv processes such as @xmath19 and/or @xmath20 can therefore be an important source of information on the @xmath14 mixings in @xmath13 and/or family mixings in @xmath12 .",
    "motivated by this natural occurrence of lfv due to neutrino oscillation , in this paper , we study the prospect of discovering lfv in the slepton sector at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) using mass reconstruction techniques .",
    "we do not use any particular scenario to generate the lfv in the leptonic sector .",
    "instead , we use a bottom up approach so that this study can be applied to any model of lfv .    at the lhc",
    ", the squarks and gluinos should be produced from the proton - proton collisions in any susy model if the masses of these colored objects are @xmath21 .",
    "these colored objects decay via a cascade process ultimately into the lightest susy particle , which is the lightest neutralino ( @xmath22 ) in this paper .",
    "we consider the well motivated scenario where r - parity is conserved , so that the @xmath22 is stable and can be the dark matter candidate . at the detector ,",
    "the @xmath22 escapes detection and forms missing energy . in order to be able to see the lfv from the cascade decays",
    ", the cascade decay chain must contain sleptons .",
    "this happens in a large class of susy models where the squarks and gluinos decay into @xmath1 or the lightest chargino , @xmath23 , by emitting quarks ( jets ) .",
    "the @xmath1 and the @xmath23 then decay into sleptons and leptons .",
    "the sleptons eventually decay into leptons and the @xmath22 .",
    "the entire decay process is : @xmath24 it is possible that @xmath23 may be produced instead of @xmath1 , in which case @xmath23 decays into @xmath25 via charged slepton or sneutrino production .    in the msugra framework ,",
    "the first two generation sleptons , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , are highly degenerate without lfv effects .",
    "however , introducing some lfv effects causes a mass splitting between these susy particles .",
    "if these particles are accessible at the lhc , then measuring this mass splitting can help to probe the lfv  @xcite .",
    "however , the first two generation sleptons are very difficult to probe by direct production at the lhc . additionally , for larger @xmath7 , the staus are much lighter compared to the first two generation sleptons .",
    "thus , the branching ratio into these heavier sleptons from other susy particles is very small .",
    "we propose a new technique in this paper that only depends on a mass measurement of the lightest slepton .",
    "our final state of interest contains at least two hadronically decaying taus , @xmath28 , plus missing transverse energy , @xmath29 . using the @xmath30 signal , it has been shown in various studies  @xcite that the @xmath0 invariant mass distribution , @xmath31 , involving opposite sign ( os)@xmath32like sign ( ls ) combinations of the two taus shows a clear endpoint or peak , which is a function of the lighter stau mass and the two lightest neutralino masses . in particular",
    ", it is also shown that using kinematic observables ( such as various invariant mass distributions of the jets and taus as well as the @xmath33 distribution of the taus ) , one can solve for the gluino , squark , lighter stau , and lightest neutralino masses in various susy models  @xcite .",
    "since the masses are reconstructed from the observables , this technique is very general and can be applied to any generic susy model .",
    "since the slepton - neutralino and slepton - chargino interactions carry the information of lfv , we investigate one of the major cascade decay chains involving the sleptons . as we have discussed above , in non - lfv scenarios , the final states contain only taus when staus are the lighter of sleptons , and the @xmath31 distribution shows a clear endpoint and peak .",
    "however , when lfv is present , we can have the decay modes @xmath34 and/or @xmath35 .",
    "the authors of @xcite proposed a search for the lfv signal in an excess in os @xmath8-@xmath28 over os @xmath36-@xmath28 events .",
    "their analysis assumed no lfv decays in the @xmath36-@xmath28 channels . in this paper , we propose a complementary method using a `` transfer '' function , which can be used for the @xmath8-@xmath28 and @xmath36-@xmath28 lfv channels simultaneously .",
    "( see sec .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ origin ] we discuss further the origins of lfv terms in susy , as well as our particular implementation of such lfv terms for this study . in sec .",
    "[ massdetermination ] we show `` measurements '' of the susy masses using non - lfv decays . measuring these susy masses is a crucial step in estimating the non - lfv background . in sec .",
    "[ lfvsearch ] we propose a technique to estimate this background and extract the effects of lfv .",
    "this technique is based upon the hadronic tau pair signal that is common to both the lfv and non - lfv case .",
    "we report the feasibility of detecting the lfv component at the lhc .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ conclu ] .",
    "lfv effects can be generated by the neutrino seesaw mechanism in susy as follows . at the grand unified scale",
    "we have the msugra boundary condition and thus , there is no flavor violation anywhere except in the yukawa couplings .",
    "it should be noted that in the absence of neutrino masses , there is only one leptonic yukawa matrix , @xmath37 , for the charged leptons , which can be diagonalized at @xmath9 and which will remain diagonal to the weak scale .",
    "thus , it would not induce any flavor violation in the slepton sector in msugra models . however , to satisfy the neutrino mixing data , the right - handed neutrinos have masses of order @xmath15 , which is lower than @xmath9 .",
    "these right - handed neutrino masses must be @xmath38 . in the momentum regime @xmath39 where the @xmath14 fields are active",
    ", the soft masses of the sleptons will feel the effects of lfv in the neutrino yukawa sector through the renormalization group evolution . at the scale @xmath15 ,",
    "the slepton mass matrix is no longer universal in flavor , and this nonuniversality will remain down to the weak scale .    since we are interested in the phenomenological aspects of such lfv at the lhc , we simply introduce a term which causes lfv by hand within the charged slepton mass matrix . the charged slepton mass matrix is a @xmath40 matrix and is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 represents the @xmath43 matrix for the soft masses for left sleptons , @xmath44 represents the @xmath43 matrix for the soft masses for right sleptons , and @xmath45 represents the @xmath43 diagonal matrix with elements @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the trilinear soft mass term and @xmath48 is the diagonal charged lepton mass ( @xmath49 ) for generation @xmath50 . in msugra , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the effects of lfv can be produced when off - diagonal elements in @xmath53 are present . during the diagonalization of this mass matrix ( which puts us in the mass eigenstate basis of sleptons ) ,",
    "if there is no such off - diagonal lfv element in @xmath53 , then the mass eigenstates are states of pure flavors .",
    "however , the off - diagonal lfv element causes the mass eigenstates to become mixtures of different flavors .",
    "these mixed - flavor mass eigenstates naturally act sometimes as one flavor , and sometimes as another .    consequently",
    ", if the second lightest neutralino , @xmath1 , is produced at the lhc from the cascade decays of squarks , then it can decay to @xmath54 , @xmath55 , or @xmath56 final states , plus @xmath29 due to the undetectable lightest neutralino , @xmath22 . on the other hand ,",
    "when lfv producing off - diagonal elements are introduced , the final states from the @xmath1 decay can also have @xmath57 , @xmath58 , or @xmath59 final states plus @xmath29 .",
    "if , for example , the @xmath60 element [ which is the same as the @xmath61 element ] of any or all of the @xmath62 are nonzero then @xmath57 final states plus @xmath29 will appear in the lfv @xmath1 decay . in this paper , we study lfv by introducing a nonzero value of the @xmath60 element of the @xmath44 matrix",
    ". this new element also will allow the @xmath19 decay and therefore is constrained , i.e. , @xmath63  @xcite .",
    "we will define @xmath64_{23}}{\\left[{\\mathcal{m } } ^2_{rr}\\right]_{33}}\\ ] ] to quantify the amount of lfv .",
    "this quantity will enter into the lfv decay modes of neutralinos and sleptons at the lhc and @xmath19 amplitude .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we see that the lfv and non - lfv decay channels both involve the @xmath65 , @xmath22 , and @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , for lfv which is not too large to introduce appreciable change in the stau mass , it is possible to reconstruct the @xmath2 invariant mass distribution , @xmath66 , whose endpoint will coincide with the end point of the @xmath31 distribution .",
    "however , the @xmath66 distribution can also be present even when there is non - lfv , due to the leptonic tau decay , @xmath67 .",
    "this is a major background to the lfv signal .",
    "thus , in order to understand the lfv signal at the lhc , we must first be able to estimate this background . in order to do this",
    ", we must measure the masses of the susy particles involved in both the lfv and non - lfv signals as accurately as possible .",
    "thus , in this section we demonstrate the technique used to determine the susy particle masses involved in the lfv decay chain , which we will discuss in sec .",
    "[ lfvsearch ] .",
    "specifically , we will determine the @xmath65 , @xmath22 , and @xmath1 masses .",
    "since the subsystem @xmath1-@xmath65-@xmath22 involves the decay chain that is essential for the study of lfv at the lhc , we need to produce this subsystem in the cascade decays of @xmath68 , @xmath69 that can occur as follows : @xmath70 the signal of this decay chain at the lhc is characterized by high energy jets ( from the squark decays ) , a pair of oppositely charged tau leptons , and a large missing energy signal ( from the lightest neutralino , which escapes detection ) .",
    "we need to determine the @xmath71 and @xmath65 masses from this chain .    in order to determine the masses",
    ", we choose a model in msugra  @xcite , generate the mass spectrum for that model using  @xcite , simulate lhc collision events at @xmath72 using  @xcite , and model the detector response with  @xcite .",
    "although the model point is excluded by the lhc experiments , we choose @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 as a benchmark point for a comparison with our previous study for the coannihilation case  @xcite .",
    "the relevant masses @xmath71 and @xmath65 at this benchmark point are shown in table  [ tab : massbenchmark ] .",
    "we stress that the technique presented here can be used for any susy model point with heavier susy masses as long as the @xmath1-@xmath65-@xmath22 subsystem is present in the cascade decay chains of susy particles .",
    "as stated above , our benchmark point has already been ruled out at the lhc , since @xmath78  @xcite . however , since the @xmath68 and @xmath69 masses set the cross section of susy production in the analysis , we can go to any other point of the parameter space with larger @xmath68 and @xmath69 masses .",
    "these larger masses do not change the presence of the @xmath1-@xmath65-@xmath22 subsystem of interest .",
    "thus , by scaling the luminosity by the cross section times the branching ratio of @xmath68 and @xmath69 into @xmath1 , we can achieve the same degree of accuracies for determining the @xmath71 and @xmath65 masses or the amount of lfv .",
    "for this parameter space point @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "however , we can change these branching ratios by changing the wino - bino content of the lightest two neutralinos .",
    "for instance , by departing from the gaugino mass unification scheme in msugra , we can find a model where the @xmath1 is almost entirely bino - like . in this case ,",
    "@xmath81 , increasing the overall branching ratio of squarks into our decay chain of interest by a factor of about three .",
    "thus , the luminosity requirement in the analysis of the @xmath82 chain is dictated by @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the production cross section of @xmath82 and @xmath69 at the lhc , @xmath85 is the acceptance for the jets plus @xmath29 system , and @xmath86 is acceptance for the @xmath54 system . now , as the @xmath82 and @xmath69 masses increase , @xmath84 will go down .",
    "however , @xmath85 and @xmath86 can be maintained the same ( by adjusting the cuts ) .",
    "thus , to achieve the same result for a different @xmath87 , the analysis technique remains the same ; only a different amount of luminosity is needed .",
    "our benchmark point described above ( and shown in table  [ tab : massbenchmark ] ) has an overall production cross section of @xmath88 pb according to our  simulation .",
    "if we choose a model point that has a similar decay chain scenario and that has not already been ruled out , we can estimate how much more luminosity would be required as compared to our benchmark .",
    "for example , another msugra point ( with @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 ) has larger squark and gluino masses , yet still has the @xmath54 system of interest .",
    "this point has a cross section of @xmath91 pb .",
    "thus , we would naively expect to require a factor of 70 more luminosity than we present here . as suggested above , the acceptances may also change . however , we can alter the cuts to maintain the luminosity requirement .",
    "we have shown a similar luminosity scaling behavior in a previous analysis  @xcite    .relevant mass spectrum for our chosen msugra benchmark point : @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "all masses are in gev .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we investigated the possibility of finding evidence of lfv using a new technique , called a `` transfer function , '' along with mass reconstruction techniques at the lhc .",
    "we constructed the @xmath0 and @xmath2 invariant mass distributions .",
    "we used the transfer function to convert the @xmath0 mass distribution into the non - lfv @xmath2 mass distribution , @xmath92 .",
    "the subtraction of the non - lfv @xmath2 distribution from the regular @xmath2 distribution left us with the lfv signal distribution , @xmath93 .    for our benchmark model ( @xmath94 ) ,",
    "shown in table  [ tab : massbenchmark ] , we needed @xmath95 to observe a @xmath96 lfv signal for the case where @xmath97 .",
    "one can probe ( at the @xmath96 level ) @xmath98 with a luminosity of @xmath99 for the parameter space discussed so far .",
    "however , these luminosity requirements are highly model dependent .",
    "if one goes to any other model point where @xmath1 decays into @xmath100 , our analysis still applies . the luminosity requirement can be scaled by @xmath101 .",
    "one can reduce the requirement of luminosity with a reduction in the systematic uncertainty of the tau energy scale at the lhc experiments .",
    "lastly , we emphasize here that we have developed a new technique that can probe a lfv effect in this complex final state at the lhc .",
    "this technique will be equally effective to probe lfv in other susy models with a similar decay chain as a final state .",
