    "in 2013 the icecube neutrino observatory published observational evidence for the existence of extraterrestrial high - energy neutrinos ( @xcite ) .",
    "this evidence was obtained through a ` hese ' analysis of the first two years of data taken with the 79 and 86 string icecube detector .",
    "the addition of a third year of data resulted in the evidence evolving to a 5 @xmath11 discovery of these extraterrestrial neutrinos ( @xcite ) .",
    "icecube s 3-year hese analysis uncovered a total of 37 extraterrestrial neutrino candidates with deposited energy in the range of 30 tev to 2 pev .",
    "the null hypothesis that all of these 37 events are from an atmospheric background was rejected at the @xmath12 level of confidence . employing a series of likelihood - based tests ,",
    "the icecube collaboration found no significant evidence against an isotropic distribution for the hese neutrino candidates . with the discovery of extraterrestrial neutrinos",
    ", icecube has open a new window through which to view the high - energy universe . due to their importance , these 37 candidate neutrino events have been interpreted within a range of galactic and extra - galactic scenarios ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "neutrino emission from high - energy astrophysical sources capable of accelerating protons to relativistic energies has long been predicted .",
    "the neutrinos arise from the decay of charged mesons created in the interactions of the relativistic protons with either ambient gas ( p - p ) or ambient radiation ( p-@xmath0 ) . if the 20 tev @xmath13 2 pev extraterrestrial neutrinos detected by icecube were indeed created this way , then their existence implies the existence of astrophysical objects capable of accelerating protons to energies of at least o(10 ) to o(100 ) pev .",
    "the decay of neutral mesons created in the same interactions of the relativistic protons produce @xmath0-rays .",
    "while the p - p interactions produce a smooth power law distribution for the resultant neutrinos and @xmath0-ray fluxes , the p-@xmath0 interactions usually produce a peaked distribution for the resultant neutrinos and @xmath0-ray photons , with the peak and spread of these distributions strongly dependent upon the nature of the ` target ' photon population ( mcke et al .",
    "( 2000a , b ) ) .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of the typical neutrino and @xmath0-ray energy , @xmath14 , also depends upon the characteristics of the target photons , with a ratio of @xmath15 expected for a synchrotron radiation target and @xmath16 for a thermal radiation target distribution .",
    "regardless of whether the interaction is synchrotron p-@xmath0 or thermal p-@xmath0 , the @xmath17s tev @xmath0-rays associated with the @xmath18 tev neutrino candidates considered in this study are believed to quickly cascade down to @xmath19 gev energies due to the photon opacity of the emission region ( @xcite ) .",
    "assuming that the opacity of the neutrino@xmath20-ray emission region is large enough to facilitate the transformation of the initial tev photons down to gev energies while not being so large as to absorb the @xmath0-ray flux entirely , a search for the neutrino sources can be made with the",
    "_ fermi_-lat detector .",
    "the lat detector onboard the _ fermi _ satellite , described in detail by @xcite , is a pair - conversion telescope , sensitive to a photon energy range from below 20 mev to above 300 gev . with a large field of view , @xmath21 sr , improved angular resolution , 68% containment angle of @xmath22@xmath2 at 1 gev , and large effective area , @xmath23 @xmath24 on axis for 10 gev photons , _",
    "fermi_-lat provides an order of magnitude improvement in performance compared to its _ egret _ predecessor . since 2008",
    "august 4 , the vast majority of data taken by _",
    "fermi _ has been performed in _ all - sky - survey _ mode , whereby the _",
    "fermi_-lat detector points away from the earth and rocks north and south of its orbital plane , on subsequent orbits .",
    "this rocking motion , coupled with _",
    "s large effective area , allows _",
    "fermi _ to scan the entire @xmath0-ray sky every two orbits , or approximately every three hours .",
    "this observational characteristic affords us , for the first time , continuous monitoring of the high - energy @xmath0-ray sky and thus has important implications for the study of transient events .",
    "in addition to this , coupling _",
    "fermi_-lat s continual scanning of the sky with a long mission lifetime allows us to construct a deep exposure of the @xmath0-ray sky .",
    "icecube classifies events by the pattern of the cherenkov light seen in the detector array ; _ track _ events are those where the presence of a high - energy muon has produced a distinctive visible track of light while _ shower _ events are those where the cherenkov light , from the particle shower initiated when the neutrino interacts , is observed only in aggregate .",
    "the angular resolution for events containing visible muon tracks is much better ( @xmath25@xmath2 ) than for those that do not ( @xmath26@xmath2 ( @xcite ) . for equal neutrino fluxes of all flavours , events with tracks",
    "make up only 20% of interactions ( @xcite ) .",
    "eight of the 37 hese neutrino candidate events were classified as track events , 28 as shower events and one event was formed by two coincident cosmic - ray muon events . although there are fewer track events , the angular resolution of the track events is comparable with that of the _ fermi_-lat detector for @xmath27 gev photons which facilitates associating the track - like events of icecube s hese analysis with known _",
    "fermi_-lat detected @xmath27 gev @xmath0-ray sources .    an important product of _",
    "fermi_-lat s continual scanning of the sky is the @xmath0-ray catalogues that it periodically produces such as the one and two year point source catalogues ( 1fgl ( @xcite ) and 2fgl ( @xcite ) ) , or the second active galaxies catalogues ( 2lac ( @xcite ) ) .",
    "fermi_-lat collaboration recently released their first high - energy catalog ( 1fhl ) , which lists all @xmath28 gev sources from the first three years of _",
    "fermi_-lat observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite looked for astrophysical counterparts to the @xmath29 tev hese neutrino candidates in three @xmath0-ray catalogues including the 1fhl catalogue .",
    "padovani & resconi placed their highest priority on the tevcat catalogue which reaches the tev regime .",
    "unsurprisingly , given that the neutrino sample of their study was dominated by shower events ( 83% ) with an average median angular error of @xmath30@xmath2 , they found a large amount of spatial correlation between the catalogues and their neutrino candidates . to therefore determine the plausibility of the association between the tev emitting coincident objects , they had identified , and the neutrino candidates , padovani & resconi compared the @xmath0-ray spectral energy density of the object with the neutrino flux per event at the specific energy of the relevant neutrino and assessed whether a simple extrapolation plausibly connected the @xmath0-rays with the neutrino . around",
    "10  % of the tevcat counterparts passed this energy diagnostic .",
    "for the counterparts which were listed only in the 1fhl catalogue , padovani & resconi decided there was too big a gap between the source s highest detected @xmath0-ray energy and the neutrino energy to make a sensible link .",
    "padovani & resconi found no spatial correlation between the 1fhl catalogue and the median angular error radius of the three track - like events in their neutrino sample , although they did note that the 2fgl source pks 0723 - 008 is correlated with neutrino candidate # 5 and that the 1fhl source 4c@xmath31 and the 2fgl source pks",
    "0823 - 321 were just outside the median angular errors of candidates # 13 and # 3 respectively .    in what could be considered the inverse cross - correlation ,",
    "the icecube collaboration have recently performed a likelihood search for cumulative neutrino emission from a large sample of of 2lac sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "the neutrino sample used was a muon - track sample from the years 2009 - 2011 containing over 300,000 events with a median angular resolution of 1@xmath2 at 1 tev and 0.5@xmath2 at 100 tev .",
    "in the southern hemisphere the sample is dominated by muons from air showers and in the upgoing region the majority of events come from atmospheric muon neutrinos .",
    "this was accounted for in the likelihood analysis through the background probability distribution function .",
    "the study found no significant correlation and concluded that 2lac blazars are not responsible for the majority of the diffuse astrophysical neutrinos reported in @xcite .",
    "thus , there is currently , no clear association between the icecube extraterrestrial neutrino candidates and @xmath0-ray sources and as padovani & resconi remarked , this strongly motivates more tev photon observations .",
    "if it is the case , as mentioned above , that the @xmath17s tev @xmath0-rays quickly cascade down to @xmath19 gev energies then the @xmath0-ray counterparts of the neutrino sources may be revealed through a close analysis of _ fermi_-lat observations .",
    "here , rather than cross - correlating against precompiled catalogues , we use the deep exposure of the first 70 months of _ fermi_-lat operation to search for gev counterparts to the track events of icecube s 3-year hese analysis .",
    "such an analysis , while sensitive to catalogued sources , also allows us to search for faint @xmath0-ray sources not present in the existing _ fermi _ catalogues and , in the absence of evidence for a source , determine upper limits for the associated @xmath0-ray flux .",
    "also the 70 month _",
    "fermi_-lat data set contains the 3 year time period covered by the icecube hese search which allows our analysis to be sensitive to the possibility that the neutrinos were produced during the flare of a normally faint source .",
    "all neutrino candidates with a track - like topology are investigated , with the exception of event # 28 , which displays evidence of a cosmic ray induced air shower in the icetop detector accompanying the neutrino candidate , thus suggesting it is part of the atmospheric background .",
    "each of the remaining neutrino candidates are considered independently . in section 2",
    ", we describe the _",
    "fermi_-lat observations and data analysis routines employed during our study .",
    "section 3 touches on the gev properties of the new @xmath0-ray point sources discovered during our study , with section 4 briefly discussing possible interpretations of the non - detection of gev emission spatially co - incident with the origin of the neutrino candidates considered .",
    "the data used in this study comprise all _ fermi_-lat event and spacecraft data taken during the first 70 months of _ fermi_-lat operation , from 2008 august 4 to 2014 june 4 , which equates to a mission elapsed time ( met ) interval of 239557417 to 423589417 . all source @xmath0-ray events - ray ( see @xcite for details of event classification ) . ] , in the @xmath32 gev energy range , within a 5@xmath2 radius of interest ( roi ) centered on the right ascension and declination of the origin of hese track - like events were considered . in accordance with the pass7_rep criteria , a zenith cut of 100@xmath2",
    "was applied to the data to remove any cosmic ray induced @xmath0-rays from the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the good time intervals were generated by applying a filter expression of `` ( data_qual@xmath331 ) & & ( lat_config@xmath331 ) & & abs(rock_angle)@xmath34 52 '' to the data .",
    "a summary of the analysis criteria is given in table [ analysis ] .",
    ".summary of the criteria utilised in this analysis . [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     [ indexdetails ]",
    "of all extraterrestrial neutrino candidates considered in this study , only event # 5 has a @xmath0-ray point source within the median angular error of the track reconstruction , with the bl lac object pks 0723 - 008 located @xmath35@xmath2 from # 5 s origin .",
    "however , monte carlo simulations revealed the probability that a 2lac source is positionally coincident with event # 5 to be @xmath3% , suggesting that this positional coincidence is merely a chance event .",
    "in addition to the high probability that a 2lac source is positionally coincident with a single track - like neutrino event , there are no distinguishing characteristics in the @xmath1 gev @xmath0-ray properties , when compared to the other bl lac objects in the 2lac catalogue , to suggest pks 0723 - 008 is a source of neutrinos .",
    "for example , while the 50-day binned lightcurve shown in figure 8 , reveals periods of increased @xmath0-ray flux @xmath36 times greater than the 70-month average , these flare periods do not coincide with the detection of neutrino event # 5 .",
    "indeed , during the 50 day period in which the neutrino candidate was observed , no significant @xmath1 gev @xmath0-ray emission was observed from pks 0723 - 008 .",
    "likewise , while pks 0723 - 008 does appear to have a fairly hard spectrum , there is no evidence that pks 0723 - 008 is a source of vhe photons .",
    "so in summary the combination of the insignificant spatial coincidence and the the observed @xmath0-ray properties suggest that pks 0723 - 008 is not the source of the # 5 neutrino candidate .",
    "therefore , this study has found the origin of the hese track events to be @xmath0-ray dark in the @xmath1 gev energy range .",
    "a possible explanation for the non - detection of @xmath1 gev @xmath0-ray emission spatially coincident with the observed neutrino events is that the diffuse neutrino flux observed by icecube is the aggregate of a very large number of faint neutrino sources which , correspondingly , are faint @xmath0-ray sources .",
    "icecube s own point source limits ( @xcite ) mean that a diffuse astrophysical flux at the level of @xmath37 gev @xmath6 s@xmath7 sr@xmath7 , as reported in ( @xcite ) , must be distributed over at least o(50 ) sources . in order to be able",
    "to relate the neutrino flux from an individual source to a corresponding photon flux at gev energies requires detailed modelling which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however we note that typical models ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) relating a source s photon and neutrino bolometric luminosities , would suggest that a photon flux , at the level of the upper limits presented in table 2 , is associated with an @xmath38 neutrino flux at least an order of magnitude below the current icecube point source limits .",
    "thus , if the tev photons associated with the neutral mesons are able to quickly cascade down to the gev energies considered in this dedicated analysis of _ fermi_-lat observations _ and _ if the typical relationships between the neutrino and photon bolometric luminosities hold , then our photon limits suggest that the diffuse neutrino flux observed by icecube is drawn from the aggregate of at least o(500 ) sources .",
    "alternative explanations could be that the assumption of efficient cascade of tev photons to gev energies is not valid , or that the gev emission is absorbed after leaving the neutrino source or that the neutrino candidates we have studied are in fact residual atmospheric background events .",
    "we briefly touch on each of these possibilities below .",
    "\\(i ) the ratio of the neutrino and @xmath0-ray energies produced through the decay of @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 mesons is close to unity , such that the @xmath42 tev neutrinos considered in this study should be accompanied by @xmath0-rays of a similiar energy .",
    "these tev photons are believed to quickly cascade down to @xmath34100 gev energies due to the photon opacity of the emission region ( @xcite ) . in the context of the emission region",
    "s @xmath0-ray opacity , the @xmath0-ray non - detection of the neutrino sources of our study can be interpreted as being due to the opacity being either too small or too large .",
    "if the opacity is too low , the tev @xmath0-rays are able to freely escape and thus the @xmath0-ray flux is not able to cascade down to the photon energy range considered in this study .",
    "likewise , if the opacity is too high , the tev @xmath0-ray flux would quickly be processed to energies well below the photon energy range considered in this study .",
    "observations with the future cherenkov telescope array or hawc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) would shed light onto the former possibility , while detailed multi - wavelength studies would be needed to investigate the latter possibility .",
    "\\(ii ) in parallel to the effects of internal absorption , the lack of @xmath0-ray emission associated with the hese track events could be the result of photon absorption external to the neutrino source .",
    "this attentuation primarily occurs through the process of photon - photon pair production ( @xmath43 e@xmath44e@xmath45 ) . for @xmath0-rays ,",
    "the photon field primarily responsible for this photon - photon attentuation is the extragalactic background light ( ebl ; e.g @xcite ) .",
    "a study undertaken by the hess collaboration found that the intensity of the ebl , at near - infrared / optical wavelengths , is close to the lower limit given by the integrated light of resolved galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , the _ fermi_-lat collaboration extended this study using @xmath46 gev data from the first 46 months of _ fermi_-lat operation , and drew a similiar conclusion ( @xcite ) .",
    "importantly , the _",
    "fermi_-lat collaboration also defined a critical photon energy , @xmath47 , below which @xmath48% of the @xmath0-ray photons are absorbed by the ebl .",
    "the lowest @xmath47 they derived was @xmath49 gev for @xmath0-ray sources in the redshift range @xmath50 .",
    "as such , while invoking @xmath51 absorption by the ebl as the primary reason for the @xmath0-ray non - detection can account for the lack of @xmath52 gev flux , it can not solely explain the lack of @xmath53 gev flux .",
    "\\(iii ) finally , we note that icecube s hese analysis claimed the discovery of extraterrestrial neutrinos at a @xmath54 confidence level , with 37 candidate neutrino events detected relative to an expected background of @xmath55 cosmic ray muon events and @xmath56 atmospheric neutrinos . as such ,",
    "anywhere between a quarter and two - thirds of the neutrino candidates detected are expected to be background events from cosmic rays interacting with the earth s atmosphere .",
    "these background events are expected to concentrate at lower energies ( see figure 2 of @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the residual atmospheric background contamination was reduced by only considering the @xmath57 tev neutrino candidates in their correlation studies . applying an @xmath57 tev cut to the track events of our study",
    "removes 3 neutrino candidates , events # 8 , # 18 and # 37 .",
    "a closer inspection of the background atmospheric rates expected in the @xmath58 tev energy range and declination bands of these removed events , as shown by supplemental figure 5 of @xcite , reveals an expected background of 1 - 2 events in the 10 @xmath2 declination band around events # 8 and # 18 and around 1 event in the 10 @xmath2 declination band around event # 37 , making it rather likely that these neutrino candidates have an atmospheric origin .",
    "however , inspecting the expected background rates for the @xmath57 tev neutrino candidates in their respective energy and declination band reveals a smaller number of expected background atmospheric events , ranging from @xmath59 to @xmath60 . in particular for event # 13 , which has a deposited energy of @xmath61 tev and a northern hemisphere origin , @xmath62 background events are expected in its declination band during the 988 day icecube livetime of the 3 year hese analysis ( see supplemental figure 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "this means that , while a contribution from the residual atmospheric background contamination could explain some of the non - detections of possible @xmath0-ray counterparts to the hese track events , particularly at lower energies , it can not explain all of them .",
    "the angular resolution of a @xmath63 gev photon detected by the _",
    "fermi_-lat detector is comparable to the median angular error of icecube s hese neutrino candidates detected as track - type events . as such , associating the track - like events of icecube s hese analysis with known _",
    "fermi_-lat detected @xmath27 gev sources is simplified greatly when compared to trying to find counterparts to icecube s shower - like events .",
    "motivated by this , we analysed 70 months of _",
    "fermi_-lat observations to search for @xmath1 gev emission spatially coincident with the origin of icecube s hese track events . with the exception of event # 5 , no @xmath27",
    "gev emission spatially coincident with the origin of the neutrino events was found .",
    "for these events , 95% confidence level upper limits were calculated .",
    "event # 5 is the only hese track - like event that has a @xmath0-ray point source within the median error of its origin , with pks 0723 - 008 being separated from the origin by @xmath35@xmath2 .",
    "a monte carlo study found that the probability of such a spatial coincidence occuring by chance is relatively high , with it occuring in 37% of the cases we simulated .",
    "as such , an insignificant spatial coincidence , combined with the observed @xmath0-ray properties , suggests that pks 0723 - 008 is not the source of the # 5 neutrino candidate .",
    "the study undertaken here has been conducted on the assumption that the intrinsic tev photons associated with the neutral mesons are able to quickly cascade down to gev energies without being absorbed entirely .",
    "we note that , if this assumption is incorrect , and the tev photons are able to freely escape from the source , observations with ground - based arrays such as hess , veritas and cta are required to search for the @xmath0-ray counterparts to icecube s neutrino events . however , if the production of these neutrinos is due to transient events , the survey nature of hawc observations would be required .",
    "these observations are strongly encouraged .",
    "this work was undertaken with the financial support of durham university and the marsden fund council of new zealand , and has made use of public _ fermi _ data obtained from the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) , provided by nasa s goddard space flight center .",
    "this work has also made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , caltech , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
    "we thank the _",
    "fermi_-lat collaboration for the quality of the data and analysis tools that were used in this study .",
    "finally we thank the referee for her / his comments and suggestions that have improved the quality and clarity of this paper .",
