    "the physics potential of a photon collider  @xcite is very rich and complementary to the physics program of the and hadron - hadron colliders .",
    "it is an ideal place to study the mechanism of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) and the properties of the higgs - boson .    in paper",
    "@xcite we performed a realistic simulation of the standard model ( sm ) higgs - boson production at the photon collider for @xmath0 and @xmath1 decay channels , for higgs - boson masses above 150  gev . from the combined analysis of @xmath0 and @xmath1 invariant mass distributions the @xmath2 partial width of the higgs boson , , can be measured with an accuracy of 3 to 8% and the phase of @xmath3 amplitude , , with an accuracy between 30 and 100  mrad . in paper",
    "@xcite we extended this analysis to the generalised standard model - like scenario @xmath4 of the two higgs doublet model ii , 2hdm(ii ) , with and without cp - violation . in case of the solution @xmath4 with a weak cp violation via @xmath5 mixing",
    ", the mixing angle @xmath6 can be constrained to about 100  mrad for low values of @xmath7 .",
    "we found that for a general 2hdm  ( ii ) with cp violation , only the combined analysis of lhc , lc and photon collider measurements allows for the precise determination of higgs - boson couplings and of cp - violating @xmath5 mixing angle @xcite .    in this paper",
    "our aim is to establish cp - property of the higgs - boson in a generic model with a direct cp - violation .",
    "the measurement of the higgs - boson properties at the photon collider at tesla is studied in detail for masses between 200 and 350  gev , using realistic luminosity spectra and detector simulation .",
    "the model with generic , cp - violating higgs - boson couplings to vector bosons @xcite leads to different angular distributions for a scalar- and pseudoscalar - type of couplings . from a combined analysis of invariant mass distributions and angular distributions of the @xmath0 and @xmath8 decay - products",
    "the cp - parity of the observed higgs state can be determined independently on a production mechanism @xcite .",
    "results given in this paper supersede results presented in the second part of our earlier work  @xcite .",
    "following the analysis described in @xcite we consider a generic model with a direct cp violation , with tensor couplings of a higgs boson , @xmath9 , to @xmath8 and @xmath10 given by : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the 4-momenta of the vector bosons .",
    "contributions to gauge couplings with @xmath14 have a structure of the cp - even sm higgs boson coupling , , give the angular distributions similar to that of the sm higgs boson and therefore we will not consider this case separately . ] whereas the ones with @xmath15 correspond to a general cp - odd coupling for the spin-0 boson . coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be written as : @xmath16 the couplings of the standard model higgs boson are reproduced for @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( i.e. @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) . below we will limit ourselves to @xmath21 and @xmath22 region , corresponding to small deviation from the standard model coupling .",
    "however , we do not make any assumptions concerning higgs - boson couplings to fermions and we allow for deviations from sm predictions in and .",
    "therefore our results do not depend on the assumed higgs - boson production mechanism and our approach can be considered as model - independent . to simplify the analysis",
    ", we only assume that the @xmath23 branching ratios to @xmath10 and @xmath8 are the same as in the standard model .",
    "no substantial deviations in the @xmath10 and @xmath8 branching ratios are expected unless higgs - boson yukawa couplings to up- or down - type fermions become very large .",
    "possible small deviation in the branching ratios are equivalent to  variation .",
    "here we consider the higgs boson decays to gauge bosons .",
    "the angular distributions of the secondary @xmath10 and @xmath8 decay products turn out to be very sensitive to the cp properties of the higgs - boson @xcite .",
    "angular variables which can be used in the analysis are defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : ang_def ] .    to test cp - properties of the higgs - bosons the distributions of the polar angles @xmath24 and @xmath25 as well as the @xmath26 distribution , where @xmath26 is the angle between two @xmath27- or two @xmath28-decay planes , are used . here",
    "we propose to consider , instead of two - dimensional distribution in ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) the distribution in a new variable , defined as @xmath31 the @xmath32-variable corresponds to the ratio of the angular distributions expected for the decay of a scalar and a pseudoscalar ( in a limit @xmath33 ) @xcite .",
    "it proves to be very useful and complementary to @xmath26 variable .    the angular distributions in @xmath26 and @xmath32 , expected for a scalar ( @xmath34 ) and a pseudoscalar ( @xmath35 ) higgs decays , ,",
    "are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : ang_exp ] .",
    "they clearly distinguish between decays of scalar ( @xmath36 ) and pseudoscalar ( @xmath37 ) higgs .",
    "for the scalar higgs the distributions are almost flat in both @xmath26 and @xmath32 .",
    "for the pseudoscalar case these two distributions have totally different character . from the measurement of one or other , or both of these distributions it s possible to establish the cp properties of the higgs boson , even without taking into account the production mechanism .",
    "note , that the theoretical distribution of the higgs decay - angle @xmath38 is expected to be flat both for scalar and pseudoscalar higgses , as this is characteristic to spin 0 particle .",
    "however , the measured @xmath38 distributions for @xmath36 and @xmath37 decays can differ due to the different acceptance corrections and interference with a non - resonant background .",
    "therefore , in the observed @xmath38 distributions , as well as reconstructed  invariant mass distributions for @xmath10 and @xmath8 decays , some sensitivity to the higgs - boson couplings can show up .",
    "our analysis uses the compaz parametrisation @xcite of the realistic luminosity spectra for a photon collider at tesla .",
    "we assume that the centre - of - mass energy of colliding electron beams , @xmath39 , is optimised for the production of a higgs boson with a given mass .",
    "all results presented in this paper were obtained for an integrated luminosity corresponding to one year of the photon collider running .",
    "the total photon - photon luminosity increases from about 600  fb@xmath40 for @xmath41  gev ( optimal beam energy choice for @xmath42  gev ) to about 1000  fb@xmath40 for @xmath43  gev ( @xmath44  gev ) .",
    "measurement of the angular distributions has been studied using the samples of @xmath8 events generated with the pythia  @xcite and simdet  @xcite programs , as described in @xcite .",
    "the resolutions of the reconstructed decay angles @xmath45 and @xmath46 , for the scalar higgs - boson with mass of 300  gev ( primary electron - beam energy of 209  gev ) are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : ang_res ] for the leptonic and hadronic @xmath27 decays .",
    "a very good resolution is obtained for all considered distributions , nevertheless the measured angular distributions are strongly affected by the selection cuts used in the analysis . because of the cut on the lepton and jet angles , applied to preserve a good mass resolution ( see @xcite for more details ) , we observe a significant loss of the selection efficiency for the events with lepton or jet emitted along the beam direction .",
    "also the durham jet algorithm used in the event reconstruction imposes constraints on the angular separation between leptons and jets .",
    "both effects result in a highly non - uniform angular acceptance .",
    "the obtained selection efficiencies for @xmath47 events , as a function of the angle @xmath26 , are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : acc_300_705 ] .",
    "additional cuts on the reconstructed @xmath8 invariant - mass have been introduced to optimise the signal measurement : for higgs boson mass of 300  gev the accepted mass range lies between 286 and 312  gev . the efficiencies for @xmath8 events coming from decays of scalar , pseudoscalar higgs and non - resonant background are compared .",
    "the polar - angle distributions differ among these three classes of events , therefore significantly different acceptances are obtained .",
    "understanding of this effect is crucial , as it can mimic a pseudoscalar type of distribution .",
    "for the first time such effect is taken into account in the analysis of the considered process .    in the following analysis ,",
    "the reconstructed @xmath26 values range from 0 to @xmath48 , since we are not able to distinguish between quark and antiquark jet .",
    "for arbitrary values of model parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 we calculate the expected angular and invariant mass distributions for @xmath8 and @xmath0 events by convoluting the corresponding cross - section formula with the analytic photon - energy spectra compaz  @xcite . to take into account detector effects , we convolute this further with the function parameterising the invariant - mass resolution and the acceptance function containing the angular- and jet - selection cuts . for the measurement of the event distributions in @xmath26 and @xmath32",
    "we introduce the additional cuts on the reconstructed @xmath8 invariant mass ( for @xmath8 events ) or on the reconstructed @xmath0 invariant mass as well as on the higgs - decay angle @xmath38 ( for @xmath0 events ) .",
    "the cuts were optimised for the smallest relative error in the signal cross - section measurement .    the expected precision in the measurements of the @xmath26- and of the @xmath32-distributions , for @xmath47 events and @xmath51 events is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : histzz ] and [ fig : histww ] , respectively .",
    "calculations were performed for the primary electron - beam energy of 152.5  gev and the higgs - boson mass of 200  gev .",
    "the results are compared with the expectation of the generic model with @xmath18 ( as in sm ) and @xmath52 . for better comparison of the shape of distributions , results for pseudoscalar higgs - boson couplings ( @xmath52 )",
    "are normalised to the standard model expectations .",
    "we see , that even after taking into account beam spectra , detector effects , selection cuts and background influence , the differences between shapes of the angular distributions for the scalar and pseudoscalar couplings are still significant . therefore we should be able to constrain higgs - boson couplings from the shape of the distributions , even if the overall normalisation related to the higgs - boson production mechanism is not known .",
    "for the standard - model higgs - boson decays to @xmath8 , about 675 higgs - boson events and 145 non - resonant background events are expected after all selection cuts , in the selected mass window from 180 to 210  gev . for the @xmath53 channel about 8000 signal events",
    "are expected , compared to about 170  000 background events . in both cases",
    "a statistical precision of the signal measurement is similar .",
    "however , due to overwhelming background contribution , the @xmath53 analysis is much more dependent on systematic uncertainties .",
    "each of the considered angular distributions discussed above can be fitted with model expectations , given in terms of the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 describing higgs - boson couplings to gauge bosons , parameters  and  describing the production mechanism , and an overall normalisation .",
    "statistical errors in the determination of @xmath50 , resulting from fits to the different distributions for @xmath8 events , are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : zzcomp ] . the remaining model parameters , except for the normalisation ,",
    "are fixed to the standard model values . out of the three",
    "considered angular distributions , parameter @xmath32 turns out to be the most sensitive to the angle @xmath50 describing the cp - violation in the higgs - boson couplings .",
    "surprisingly , the smallest error is obtained from the fit to the invariant mass distribution .",
    "this is because , due to the different selection efficiencies for the scalar and pseudoscalar decays and also to interference effects , the relative normalisation of the higgs - boson signal to the non - resonant background depends on the angle @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , we include the invariant mass distributions for @xmath10 and @xmath8 decays in the combined fit .",
    "when all parameters are allowed to vary in such a fit , the invariant - mass distributions constrain mainly the   and .",
    "we calculate the expected statistical errors on the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 , from the combined fit to angular distributions measured for @xmath8 and @xmath0 decays , and to the invariant mass distributions .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] .",
    "the two photon width of the higgs boson , , the phase and normalisations of both samples are allowed to vary in the fit , so the results are independent to the production mechanism .",
    "one observes that for low higgs - boson masses below 250  gev , better constrains are obtained from the measurement of @xmath0 events , whereas for masses above 300  gev smaller errors are obtained from the measurement of @xmath8 events .",
    "the error on @xmath50 expected from the combined fit is below 50  mrad in the whole considered mass range .",
    "the corresponding error on @xmath49 is about 0.05 .",
    "an opportunity of measuring the higgs - boson properties at the photon collider at tesla has been studied in detail for masses between 200 and 350  gev , using realistic luminosity spectra and detector simulation .",
    "we considered measurement of the invariant mass distributions and the various angular distributions .",
    "a new variable is proposed to describe the polar angle distributions of the secondary @xmath0 and @xmath54-decay products .",
    "event reconstruction and selection procedure result in acceptance corrections which are highly non - uniform and depend on the higgs boson cp properties .",
