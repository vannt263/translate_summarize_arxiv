    "the  mission @xcite has revolutionized the study of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows .",
    "the mission , which relies upon training sensitive x - ray and optical telescopes on new grbs as rapidly as possible , has resulted in the accurate positioning of grb afterglows on a timescale of minutes . especially for long grbs ,",
    "this rapid localization has proven highly effective at identifying afterglows for study at other wavelengths . already , in about 2 years of operation ,  has localized more than twice as many grb afterglows than had been localized in the eight years preceding  @xcite .",
    "however ,  alone can not address all the important issues in grb research .",
    "one of the most important grb parameters is the redshift of a burst .",
    "knowledge of the redshift is not only crucial for determining the luminosity and other physical parameters of the burst , but also permits optimization of ground - based observations .",
    "for example a determination of the redshift for high - redshift grbs requires large telescopes with infra - red sensitivity , because the lyman absorption edge gets shifted beyond the long wavelength end of the -uvot sensitivity for redshifts above 5 @xcite .",
    "grbs fade rapidly and only spectroscopy can provide reliable redshifts .",
    "therefore , to search for redshifts as high as grb050904 ( z=6.29 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or even to the unexplored @xmath8 range , requires telescopes in the 8 - 10 m class making observations within the first night or two of the swift discovery . as listed in this paper ,",
    "about 6% of all -observed grbs with spectroscopic redshift have redshift z@xmath95 .",
    "observing time on such large , world - class telescopes is an extremely precious commodity .",
    "currently the limited number of target of opportunity programs must triggered based on very limited information in order to spectroscopically observe the many discovered  grb afterglow . while nearly all promptly observed  long grbs can be localized by the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , only about 34% are detected by the uv / optical telescope ( uvot ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus observers looking for high redshift bursts can filter the approximately 100 grbs found by  each year , by using the criterion : an afterglow is detected by the xrt , but not detected by the uvot .",
    "unfortunately this criterion alone only reduces the rate of high - z candidates by about 1/3 , leaving about 67 grbs to be observed per year .",
    "moreover , many other factors , e.g. reddening , can result in suppression of afterglow emission in the uvot sensitivity range ( see roming et al .",
    "2006 for a discussion ) .",
    "of course large telescope observers can wait to see if any of the smaller robotic telescopes can select candidates based on the broad - band photometric studies conducted by these telescopes .",
    "often the cost of doing this is to lose several hours waiting for the results of these small telescope studies to be reduced and transmitted , and to be subject to the vagaries of weather and other observing constraints on the ground .",
    "also grb afterglows decay rapidly .",
    "every hour of waiting reduces the chances of obtaining an optical and/or nir spectrum of the afterglow and therefore significantly decreases the chances of measuring the redshift of the burst from a spectrum .    to see whether swift xrt data alone can help to provide very early information , we conducted a study of all 55   swift long grb afterglows with known redshifts by november 2006 . on a timescale of one or two hours after the initial xrt detection of a new grb , the xrt telemeters information to the ground from which many properties of the burst can be determined , including accurate positions , x - ray flux and x - ray spectral information .",
    "the swift team has been routinely analyzing these data , and reporting them to the world via the grb coordinates network ( gcn ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it has been found that the typical afterglow can be fit with a simple power law model spectrum plus the effects of a variable amount of absorbing material ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "this absorbing material can be located either in our galaxy , in the host galaxy of the grb , or in intervening gas clouds . as shown on a theoretical basis by @xcite , extinction in grbs",
    "is expected .",
    "recently @xcite presented the results of high - resolution optical spectroscopy of the interstellar medium of grb host galaxies of  grb afterglows .",
    "for low redshift bursts , in the observer s rest - frame , the effects of local , and intervening absorption appear at roughly similar energies , and thus the effects are intermixed . for high redshift bursts , the absorbing material in the host galaxy will incur a substantial redshift .",
    "the result is that the energy band of the swift xrt is shifted to higher energies in the grb rest frame , making it difficult to detect x - ray absorption . without prior knowledge of the redshift , x - ray observations result in measurements of nh that are systematically low compared to the actual absorbing column in the host galaxy .",
    "thus if we take the apparent absorption column density @xmath1 , using the photo - electric cross - section as given by @xcite , in the observer s rest - frame , and subtract off the known absorption column density in our galaxy ( @xmath10 as given by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the residual @xmath11 will reflect the redshifted column density either in the source or in the intervening line - of - sight .",
    "if this residual column density appears high , then it is very likely that the grb is close , because distant grb absorption effects are overwhelmed by the redshift effect .",
    "of course if the column density is low , we can not tell whether the grb is near - with low intrinsic absorption - or far - with either low intrinsic absorption or redshifted high absorption .",
    "a similar method has also been proposed to estimate the redshifts of high - redshift quasars @xcite .",
    "we present the values for absorption measured in the first orbit of data for all 55   swift grbs with known spectroscopic redshifts ( section 2 ) .",
    "the x - ray data are typically available 1 - 2 hours after the detection of the burst , except for those few bursts for which observing constraints prevent  from slewing immediately .",
    "the relation we are proposing is not a functional prediction ( i.e. we do not suggest that grb redshift is derivable from xrt absorption ) , but instead we argue that we can predict the maximum redshift of an afterglow on the basis of the excess absorption @xmath6 . in section 3",
    "we present the results .",
    "finally , in section 4 we present our conclusion .    throughout the paper spectral index @xmath12",
    "is defined as @xmath13 .",
    "all errors are 1@xmath14 unless stated otherwise .",
    "table[grb_list ] lists all 55   long grbs with reported spectroscopic redshifts ( up to 2006 november ) which were observed by",
    ". we did not include short bursts since they most likely have different physical processes than the long bursts .",
    "furthermore , short burst have typically been detected at relatively low redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even though @xcite suggested that the short grb 060121 is possibly at z@xmath94.5 .",
    "we limit our sample to those bursts with spectroscopic redshifts only , because these are the most reliable redshift measurements .",
    "other methods such as photometric redshifts are less certain because a drop - out in bluer filters can also be caused by strong dust reddening .",
    "the xrt data were reduced by the _ xrtpipeline _ software version 0.10.4 which is part of the heasoft version 6.1.1 . for xrt photon counting mode data ( pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , source photons were selected by _",

    "we used the standard response matrix swxpc0to12_20010101v008.rmf for the pc mode data and swxwt0to2_20010101v008.rmf for the wt data .",
    "note : these are standard reduction techniques as used in the first xrt refined analysis gcn circular from  bursts .",
    "table[grb_list ] lists the redshift , galactic absorption column density @xmath10 , @xmath0 , the intrinsic column density @xmath17 at the redshift of the burst , x - ray energy spectral slope @xmath12 , @xmath18 of the power law fit with the absorption column density as a free parameter ( @xmath19 ) and fixed to the galactic value as given by @xcite , detection flag for the  uvot , and the reference for the spectroscopic redshift measurement . in cases where the free - fit absorption column density @xmath1 is within the errors consistent with the galactic value , we set @xmath6=0 .",
    "the left panel of figure[z_delta_nh ] compares redshift versus @xmath6 .",
    "the dotted lines at z=2.30 and @xmath20 @xmath3 are the medians in z and @xmath6 .",
    "these lines are used as cutoff lines to separate between low and high - redshift and low and high excess absorption groups in a @xmath21 contingency table2 contingency tables .",
    "a 2@xmath222 contingency table is a statistical tool that compares a property of two groups , such as in the present example : low- and high - redshift bursts with or without significant additional absorption above the galactic column density .",
    "the way this method works is the following : assume a number of low redshift bursts @xmath23 , with @xmath24 of them having low and @xmath25 having high column densities in excess of the galactic value .",
    "the ratio of low to high absorption column objects is then @xmath26 . for the high - redshift bursts the numbers are @xmath27 with @xmath28 representing the number of bursts with low excess absorption column densities and @xmath29 representing high excess absorption column densities . if the ratio of low to high absorption bursts in high - redshift bursts is the same as among low - redshift bursts , the number of high - redshift bursts with high absorption column densities is @xmath30 .",
    "the 2x2 contingency table compares the number of objects in each cell to the expected number under this assumption , and can be used to calculate the probability that the deviation from the expected number of objects is just random . ] .",
    "the results of grouping these data by these cutoff lines are given in table[2x2tab ] .",
    "we can immediately see that bursts with high excess absorption column densities @xmath6 will most likely be at low redshifts while afterglows with small @xmath6 are most likely at high redshifts . from the @xmath21 contingency table",
    "a probability of only p=0.0011 ( using a two - tailed fisher exact probability test ) that this result is random can be calculated .",
    "another statistical test to check whether the relation is purely random is the spearman rank order test . a spearman rank order test results in a correlation coefficient @xmath31 with a student s t - test @xmath32 and a probability p@xmath33 of a random distribution .",
    "the right panel of figure[z_delta_nh ] displays the above results as @xmath34 vs. @xmath35 .",
    "we use this diagram to conservatively draw a line along the envelope of the @xmath34 vs. @xmath35 distribution of the bursts , including the errors , in order to determine maximum redshift of a burst with respect to its excess absorption @xmath6 .",
    "this line is displayed as the dashed line in the right panel of figure[z_delta_nh ] and can be described as :    @xmath36    with @xmath6 in units of @xmath37 @xmath3 . from this equation",
    "we can limit the maximum expected redshift based on the excess absorption .",
    "note that this equation does not estimate the redshift of a burst .",
    "the equation only predicts the maximum redshift of a burst . as examples ,",
    "the redshift of a burst with an excess absorption @xmath38 @xmath3 is expected not to exceed z=2.1 , @xmath39 @xmath3 has z@xmath43.4 , and @xmath40 has z@xmath45 .",
    "also note that the number of bursts with redshifts z@xmath92.3 ( the median redshift ) and no excess absorption detected , so the free - fit absorption column density @xmath41 is consistent with the galactic value , is three times as high as the number of bursts with no excess absorption and a redshift z@xmath42.3 . in case we do not detect excess absorption in a burst ,",
    "most - likely this will be a burst with a redshift z@xmath92.3 .",
    "our findings of an observational relation between the excess absorption column density @xmath6 and redshift is due purely to an observational artefact : we only detect any excess absorption in high - redshift bursts which have a very large intrinsic column density , as shown in figure[z_nh ] . the dashed line at the lower boundary of the @xmath17 - z distribution displays the maximum redshift at which an intrinsic column density can be detected in the xrt energy window .",
    "our main result is that there is a clear anti - correlation between absorption column density in excess of the galactic value @xmath42 and redshift .",
    "this relation can be used to limit the range of possible redshifts .",
    "grbs for which early x - ray spectra are consistent with the galactic absorption column density are most - likely at higher redshifts ( @xmath43 ) , although a few examples of low - redshift grbs also fall into this category",
    ". however , grbs with a significant excess column density of @xmath44 @xmath3 are exclusively at redshifts z@xmath42.0 .",
    "the strong correlation we find between redshift and intrinsic @xmath45 is an observational artefact .",
    "we can only detect an intrinsic absorber if the absorption column density is large enough to affect the observable energy range .",
    "for a z=4 burst the low energy cutoff of the detector at 0.3 kev is at 1.5 kev in the rest frame of the burst . in order to detect any significant additional absorption in the observed energy window above the galactic value the intrinsic ( redshifted ) absorption has to be in the order of at least @xmath46 @xmath3 , as shown in figure[z_nh ] .",
    "there are a few points one should be cautious about : 1 ) our study is biased towards afterglows which have spectroscopic redshifts and are therefore detectable at optical and/or nir wavelengths . as a result , we 2 )",
    "may miss afterglows in galaxies seen edge - on .",
    "these afterglows would suffer from significant absorption columns on the order of several times @xmath47 @xmath3 as is commonly observed in e.g. seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "3 ) some of the early xrt wt mode data are not well - fitted by a single absorbed power law model , e.g. grbs 060614 and 060729 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) .",
    "these grbs display dramatic changes in their x - ray spectra within minutes and the spectrum can not be modelled by one single power law . in some cases",
    "the spectra require multi - component spectral models as it is the case for grb 060729 @xcite .",
    "the immediate application of our column density - redshift relation is to optimize ground - based optical and nir follow up observations .",
    "we plan to include the redshift limit information in future xrt refined analysis gcns .",
    "photometric redshifts can also be calculated on the basis of uvot data ( vanden berk et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we tested our x - ray method with bursts that have uvot photometric redshifts , but no spectroscopic redshifts and found that the results agree with each other .",
    "the advantage , however , of using the -xrt data instead of the uvot data to estimate a maximum redshift is that -xrt data are typically processed faster at the nasa  data center than the uvot data .",
    "this is due to the larger data volume of the uvot compared to the xrt data .",
    "therefore a redshift prediction can be given faster on the basis of the xrt data than on the uvot data .",
    "this will give ground - based observers at large telescopes a tool to decide which spectrograph to use - an optical spectrograph for the low - redshift bursts and a nir spectrograph for the high - redshift bursts and will optimize the use of large ground - based telescopes .",
    "note , however , that the purpose of this paper is not to discourage observers from obtaining spectra of bursts with predicted low redshifts .",
    "each spectroscopic redshift - low or high redshift - is important , because it enables us to determine physical parameters of the burst such as the isotropic energy or the break times in the light curve .",
    "therefore we encourage ground - based observers to continue to obtain spectra of afterglows whenever possible .",
    "the larger the number of bursts with spectroscopic redshifts the better our understanding of the physics of grbs will be .",
    "we would like to thank all observers at ground - based optical telescopes for their effort to obtain redshifts of the  afterglows .",
    "we would also like to thank sergio campana for discussion related to the xrt calibration , cheryl hurkett for sending us a draft of her paper on grb 050505 , and abe falcone for various discussions on the determination of the absorption column densities .",
    "in particular we want to thank eric feigelson for various discussions on statistics , and our referee johan fynbo for a fast and detailed referee s report that significantly improved the paper .",
