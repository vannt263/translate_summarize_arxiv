    "the unified model of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) explains the most basic observed properties of agns in terms of toroids of dust and gas , whose orientations to our line of sight determine the observed characteristics of these objects .",
    "the infrared spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of agns betray the presence of dust in their nuclei .",
    "some insight into the properties and distribution of the dust has been gained from observations and modeling of the 9.7  @xmath0 m silicate feature @xcite and the 3.4  @xmath0 m hydrocarbon absorption band @xcite .",
    "notable findings include differences in the spectral profile of the 10  @xmath0 m silicate feature between galaxies with differing amounts of obscuration @xcite , and evidence that the toroids are rather small , only a few parsecs in diameter at 10 microns @xcite . at shorter wavelengths",
    "many agns are known to have nuclear point sources , whose angular extents are diffraction - limited ( e.g. , at @xmath10.1  resolution as viewed in the @xmath2-band ) .    the dust close to an agn is generally expected to be accompanied by large quantities of molecular gas @xcite , so it might be assumed that medium or high resolution infrared spectroscopy would result in the detection of molecular absorption lines there .",
    "surprisingly , probably the easiest interstellar infrared molecular band to detect in absorption , the co fundamental ( @xmath3=1 - 0 ) band , whose most prominent lines are located at 4.5 - 5.0  @xmath0 m , has not yet been found toward the nucleus of the prototypical and nearby ( 14.4mpc , 1=  72  pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) seyfert 2 galaxy , ngc  1068 , at both 120  km  s@xmath4 resolution @xcite and at 20  km  s@xmath4 resolution @xcite .",
    "emission _ from molecular hydrogen in portions of the central few parsecs @xcite is the only direct evidence for gas phase molecules there .",
    "a clumpy torus was first suggested by @xcite to account for dust surviving close to agns and has been invoked by @xcite to explain the behavior of the silicate feature with orientation and the spectral breadth of the far - infrared emission .",
    "the model is supported in some specific cases by fits to the sed of an agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in ngc  1068 the presence of prominent dust absorption bands both to longer and shorter wavelengths than the co fundamental band suggest that some co absorption ought to be present . in galactic dense cloud material , a silicate optical depth of 0.4",
    ", the value found by @xcite toward the nucleus of ngc  1068 , implies an h@xmath5 column density of 0.7  @xmath6  10@xmath7  @xmath8 and a co column density of 1.0  @xmath6  10@xmath9  @xmath8 @xcite , which should be easily detectable in the fundamental band . toward the diffuse cloud in front of cyg ob2 no .",
    "12 , which has @xmath10 mag , the 10  @xmath0 m silicate absorption is of comparable strength to that in ngc  1068 and the 3.4  @xmath0 m absorption band , generally assumed to arise from stretching of c - h bonds in solid - state hydrocarbons @xcite , is considerably weaker than that band in ngc  1068 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless several ( narrow ) lines in the co fundamental band have optical depths of  0.3 @xcite .",
    "one way for co to be present but difficult to detect is if the co lines are so broad that they blend together , so that individual lines can not be seen . using different methods @xcite and @xcite",
    "have each estimated the mass of the nuclear black hole in ngc  1068 to be @xmath12  @xmath6  10@xmath11  m@xmath12 .",
    "the dimension of the outer of the torus - like clouds observed by @xcite and recently re - observed by @xcite using mid - infrared interferometry is 2  pc .",
    "together these values imply an orbital speed of 225  km  s@xmath4 , slightly less than half the spacing of lines in the co fundamental band .",
    "thus , if absorbing co is located at the outer edge of the torus , each co transition would produce an absorption 450  km  s@xmath4 wide , which is comparable to the co line spacing . in that case and assuming that the co rotational states are thermalized to at least a few hundred kelvins , the @xmath13 band spectrum would show a broad and shallow depression covering most of the band and would not be easily detectable in previous data sets .",
    "any co orbiting considerably farther from the nucleus , however , should be readily detectable in individual lines , if present with sufficient column density .",
    "for example , gas orbiting at a radius of 10  pc would produce lines with full widths at zero intensity ( fwzis ) of @xmath1200  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the high signal - to - noise ratio attainable in the @xmath13 band for ngc  1068 , has allowed us to conduct a new and more sensitive search for co absorption against the @xmath13 band continuum at the nucleus of this galaxy .",
    "we also have obtained a 3 - 4  @xmath0 m spectrum of the nucleus in very good seeing and with high enough s / n to begin to discern the spatial distribution of the 3.4  @xmath0 m feature within 0.4  ( 30  pc ) of the nucleus . in the galaxy this band , due to the c - h stretch in ethyl and methyl groups attached to hydrocarbons , is observed only in diffuse clouds @xcite .",
    "recent observations of the spatial behavior of the 9.7  @xmath0 m silicate feature toward agns have provided some information on the dust distribution in the central few tens of parsecs @xcite , in several cases revealing extended dusty structures perhaps associated with material fueling the central engine @xcite .",
    "@xcite have found stronger evidence for fueling of the ngc  1068 agn , based on high angular resolution observations of h@xmath5 line emission within the central few arc - seconds .",
    "more detailed observations of the 3.4  @xmath0 m band and a more sensitive search for co absorption promise a complementary view of the material in the center of ngc  1068 .",
    "the 35  @xmath0 m region also includes a number of high - excitation forbidden emission lines .",
    "coronal \" lines in agns have been a subject of interest during the last few decades for several reasons .",
    "first , their high ionization energies ( @xmath14100 ev ) imply that they must be excited by shocks and/or hard photons from the agn , with negligible contribution from hot stars .",
    "if the possible sources of excitation can be disentangled , for example through observation of the locations at which various lines arise , the line strengths and ratios may yield valuable information on the nature of the agn continuum in otherwise inaccessible regions of the uv / x - ray spectrum .",
    "second , if they are emitted in the inner regions of the narrow line region ( nlr ) , or even associated with the putative torus of the unified model , they can be used indirectly to study those structures .",
    "third , the widths , profiles and wavelength shifts of the lines may map extreme conditions such as shocks and outflows in regions close to the central engine , which may be spatially resolvable in nearby agns .",
    "optical spectroscopy from _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) has provided detailed information on the morphology of the emission line regions and complex velocity fields of the ionized gas associated with radio structures close to the agns ( for ngc  1068 see * ? ? ?",
    "although efforts have been made to understand the infrared spectra of agns , because of the lack of high spatial resolution information on a well - defined sample , a consensus on the location and origin of the infrared coronal lines has not yet been reached . in this respect ,",
    "ngc  1068 is a useful laboratory because of the prominent coronal line spectrum that it displays at optical , near - infrared and mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "whereas the prominent coronal lines in the optical are largely from fe , the 1.02.5  @xmath0 m region includes several other species , notably si , ca and al , and the 3.05.0  @xmath0 m range includes lines from al , si , ar , and na .    the new 35  @xmath0 m observations and their reduction are outlined in  [ obs ] , and the strengths , distributions and profiles of the emission lines and molecular and solid state absorption features are described in  [ emission ] and  [ absorption ] , respectively .",
    "comparisons with previous observations are mostly found in ",

    "the new measurements of these lines put significant constraints on the size of the high - ionization line emitting region . the detected [ si ix ] flux in the uist slit is about 3.5 times smaller than that reported by @xcite using the infrared space observatpry ( iso ) with a 14  @xmath6 20  aperture , and three times smaller than that reported by @xcite , who used a 4.4  slit width",
    "however , assuming that the [ siix ] line - emitting region through which our observations have sliced is roughly circularly symmetric , the total flux in the [ siix ] region is @xmath15.3  @xmath30  w  m@xmath31 , in agreement with the flux measured by iso and , within the uncertainties , with that by marconi et al . using adaptive optics imaging @xcite fund a rather clumpy distribution of the [ sivii ] 2.48  @xmath0 m line emission extended over @xmath11 but one that does not prefer any particular position angle , so the assumption of circular symmetry , while likely incorrect in detail , should allow a reasonable estimate of total line flux .",
    "following the same line of reasoning , the [ alvi ] line , which has a very similar flux distribution along the uist slit as [ siix ] ( see figure  [ fig : siix ] ) , would have a total flux of 1.6@xmath32  w  m@xmath31 .",
    "the total fluxes in the [ arvi ] , and [ navii ] lines would be 9  @xmath6  10@xmath33  w  m@xmath31 and 4  @xmath6  10@xmath33  w  m@xmath31 , respectively .",
    "@xcite found a 1.7 times higher flux for the [ arvi ] line , suggesting that the distribution of this ion , which possesses the lowest ionization energy of the four detected , is somewhat more extended than [ siix ] or possesses a large and very faint halo . @xcite and @xcite found that the [ sivi ] and [ sivii ] lines ( with ionization energies of 167  ev and 205  ev , respectively ) each have halos extending to a radius of 70  pc ( 1.0 ) , but they do not provide the relative contributions of the core and halo .    the absence of hydrogen 5@xmath344 recombination line emission is another noteworthy aspect of the 3 - 5  @xmath0 m spectrum in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] . the br  @xmath16 line emission detected by @xcite from the circum - nuclear ring of h  ii regions at a radius of 15 - 16  has 12 orders of magnitude lower surface brightness than that seen at the nucleus by @xcite .",
    "thus the weakness of the recombination line emission in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] is not likely to be due to subtraction of bright line emission in the offset beam , located 12  north of the nucleus , just inside the ring . @xcite",
    "have mapped the br  @xmath16 line emission in the vicinity of the nucleus at high angular resolution and have kindly made their data available to us .",
    "our limit for the br  @xmath17 flux in the central 0.2  @xmath61.0of @xmath228  @xmath610@xmath35  w  m@xmath31 is 75 times the br  @xmath16 line flux in the same aperture . assuming case b conditions this limit corresponds to an upper limit on the reddening of 3.5 mag between the wavelengths of the two lines , and , for a @xmath36@xmath37 dependence for the extinction , a visual extinction of no more than @xmath160 mag to the br  @xmath16 line - emitting region .",
    "the optical depth of the 3.4  @xmath0 m feature reported here is in good agreement with the values measured by @xcite and @xcite in larger apertures , but disagrees with values about twice as high reported by @xcite and @xcite . as the bulk of the continuum emission comes from the central point source , the differences with @xcite and @xcite are difficult to account for in terms of positional variations . in the case of the former paper , incorrect location of the short wavelength continuum may be responsible for the discrepancy , but this does not seem to be the explanation for the @xcite result . neither we , nor any other of the above observers have detected the nuclear 3.3  @xmath0 m ( pah ) emission feature reported by @xcite .",
    "it is possible that some of the features that they see are spurious , perhaps resulting from incorrect cancellation of strong telluric lines present in the 3.253.45  @xmath0 m interval .",
    "@xcite and @xcite searched for lines of the co fundamental at resolutions of 250  km  s@xmath4 and 120  km  s@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the latter authors set a 3@xmath23 upper limit of 7% of the continuum for the depths of individual co lines .",
    "in the 4.57 - 4.77  @xmath0 m portion of the current spectrum , obtained at 150  km  s@xmath4 resolution and also devoid of co lines , the signal - to - noise ratio on the continuum is about three times higher .",
    "thus , the limits both on individual lines separated from one another ( i.e. , with widths less than @xmath1500  km  s@xmath4 ) and on a broad depression due to blended co lines are significantly more stringent than those of @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite reported the detection toward the nucleus of ngc  1068 of a narrow absorption feature at 4.69  @xmath0 m , which they attributed to solid co. our spectrum shows no such feature , to a limiting absorption depth of a few percent of the continuum .",
    "one of the most important questions concerning coronal lines in agn is the excitation mechanism that drives their emission . here",
    "we discuss whether photoionization or shock ionization can account for the locations and strengths of the coronal line emission in ngc  1068 .",
    "a summary is provided at the end of this section .",
    "@xcite carried out a number of illustrative photoionization simulations in an effort to identify the optimal conditions and locations in which the coronal lines form around agn .",
    "assuming ultraviolet radiation from the central engine as the only excitation mechanism and plane - parallel , constant density slabs of gas , they determined the distances from the ionizing source in which the lines are emitted as a function of density .",
    "they provide line equivalent widths in the density - distance plane , indicating where the bulk of the emission occurs for each line , and allowing rough comparisons between observed and predicted emission line flux ratios .",
    "the [ alvi ] , [ ar vi ] and [ siix ] lines observed here are included in their calculations .",
    "their figures assume an ionizing ultraviolet continuum similar to that of a typical seyfert galaxy with @xmath38 ergs@xmath4 , but distances scale as @xmath39 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite estimate ionizing luminosities 12 orders of magnitude higher in ngc  1068 .    in the discussion",
    "below we assume an ionizing luminosity of 10@xmath40  ergs@xmath4 , which implies locations and dimensions of the emission regions are five times larger than those shown by @xcite , if all other parameters remain constant .",
    "the model then predicts that the distance and density for peak [ siix ] line emission cover 1.5100  pc and 10@xmath4110@xmath42  @xmath29 , respectively ( with the largest distances corresponding to the lowest densities ) .",
    "the observed distance of 20 pc ( 0.3 ) from the nucleus to the peak line emission corresponds to @xmath43@xmath110@xmath44  @xmath29 ) .",
    "if the actual peak is closer to the agn than observed but obscured by dust , then higher density gas would be required .    for the [ alvi ] and [ arvi ] lines",
    "the adjusted @xcite models predict distances to the peak of roughly 15400  pc for the same density range .",
    "although the spatial distribution of the [ arvi ] line flux is less precise than the other lines , it appears to be similar to that of the other two lines , with a peak at the same location .",
    "clearly the observation that the offset from the agn to the peaks of these lines of with widely varying excitations are the same is incompatible with an ionized medium of uniform density , unless the extinction is highly non - uniform across the nucleus .",
    "the current observations can be roughly reconciled with a slab of density several times 10@xmath44  @xmath29 if there is increasing extinction of the coronal line emission closer to agn , of sufficient strength to mask the true peak of the [ siix ] line emission .",
    "if the coronal line emission region is symmetrically distributed to the north and south of the agn , the extinction would need increase further to the south of the agn in order to block the line emission there from view .",
    "evidence for higher extinction to the south is in fact widespread ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "a rough lower limit to the additional extinction required to the south based on the assumption of a symmetric distribution of coronal line emission is two magnitudes at 3.93  @xmath0 m , which corresponds to approximately 70 visual magnitudes .",
    "if the highly non - uniform extinction postulated above is not present , only a density distribution of ionized gas strongly peaked 20  pc north of the agn could result in photoionization producing the observed maximum line emission from all of these ions at the same location .",
    "the calculations of @xcite also indicate that for these ions the regions of significant coronal line emission can extend to much larger distances ( @xmath1100  pc ) if gas densities decrease gradually with distance from the agn .",
    "the near agreement of our estimates of the total flux from the [ siix ] and [ arvi ] lines with measurements made by others in much larger apertures , imply that the ionized gas density must drop steeply at distance greater than @xmath150  pc from the agn .",
    "evidence supporting shock ionization in the narrow line regions of agns abounds @xcite . in the case of ngc  1068",
    ", @xcite found that 1.5  north of the nucleus [ fe vii ] is enhanced at the location of the radio jet .",
    "they interpreted this as evidence of interaction between the jet and the surrounding medium .",
    "the radio jet proceeds outward from the nucleus for an angular distance of several arc - seconds , first nearly due north and then at position angle 35  degrees @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite have studied the influence of the radio jet on the kinematics of [ o  iii ]  @xmath454959,5007 .",
    "they observed an increase in the radial velocity roughly proportional to distance from the nucleus followed by a linear decrease beyond @xmath1100  pc ( 1.4 ) and concluded that the magnitudes of these changes were so large that the neither can the jet be the sole driving force nor can gravity be the sole decelerating mechanism ( frictional forces must be significant ) .",
    "however , in the case of that line the deceleration occurs well outside of the region where we observe the higher excitation 35  @xmath0 m coronal lines .    the line emission reported here",
    "originates in ionized regions much closer to the nucleus than those observed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , evidence for shock excitation of the coronal lines is also readily apparent when one compares the 5  ghz image in fig .  1 of @xcite with our data .",
    "assuming , as they and @xcite have inferred , that source s1 is coincident with the agn , and hence with the infrared continuum peak , the peaks of [ siix ] and [ alvi ] line emission at 0.3  north are coincident with the bright radio knot c , where the jet bends to the northeast .",
    "this is highly suggestive of an interaction between the jet and gas in the nlr .",
    "also suggestive of an interaction at this location is a bright knot of h@xmath46 2.12  @xmath0 m line emission found by @xcite connecting two streamers of line emission , one of which they interpret as feeding the innermost few parsecs .",
    "the velocity profiles of the of [ siix ] line along the spatial direction , shown in figure  [ fig : velocity ] , also appear to support a jet - nlr interaction . at 0.2@xmath47 north ,",
    "a prominent blue shoulder is evident in the line profile .",
    "that structure also appears to be present 0.4  north , but it weakens significantly at 0.6 .",
    "the shoulder at 0.20.4  could be associated with ionized gas accelerated toward us by the interaction of the jet with the ambient gas near knot c. the line profile variations are somewhat reminiscent of the behavior of the [ fevii ]  @xmath366087 line reported by @xcite , but the latter is at a much larger distance north of the agn and , also unlike the infrared lines , far from where that line has its peak intensity .",
    "if shocks are the dominant excitation mechanism for these coronal lines at radio knot c , then it seems likely that some of the remaining [ siix ] and [ alvi ] line flux outside of that knot originates in other localized regions and is associated with other radio knots .",
    "the knot labeled `` ne '' in fig .  1 of @xcite , located 0.4@xmath47 to the ne of knot `` c '' and not included in our slit , is a possible candidate for some of this missing line flux . however , judging from the large extent over which [ sivii ] was observed by @xcite , we do not think that shocks totally dominate over photoionization , and expect that some contribution of the latter is present , perhaps even at radio knot c.      the infrared coronal line emission peaks 20  pc to the north of the agn for ions of a wide range of excitation , and extends to 50  pc in the highly excited [ siix ] line and presumably at least as far in the other lines .",
    "to the south there is no clear detection of any of the 35  @xmath0 m lines . increased extinction to the south",
    "can account for the north - south asymmetry , regardless of the line excitation mechanism .",
    "however , photoionization by the agn producing peaks at equal northern distances from the agn for such a large range of excitations requires a highly asymmetric gas distribution and/or a highly asymmetric distribution of obscuring dust to the north .",
    "this explanation appears contrived .",
    "evidence for collisional excitation of these lines is more compelling ; it consists of the spatial coincidence between radio knot c ( where the jet changes direction ) , a prominent knot of h@xmath46 line emission , and the emission peaks of all of the 35  @xmath0 m coronal lines .",
    "the presence at the same location of a localized prominent high velocity blue - shifted shoulder on the [ siix ] line provides further support .",
    "higher angular resolution studies of the coronal line emission would allow a more detailed comparison with the morphology of the radio emission .",
    "in his subsection we discuss that portion of the interstellar medium producing the hydrocarbon and silicate absorption features at 3.4  @xmath0 m and 9.7  @xmath0 m , but little or no absorption by gaseous co at 4.55.0  @xmath0 m .",
    "our discussion makes use of the silicate absorption feature as reported by @xcite ; its similar behavior across the nucleus as the 3.4  @xmath0 m feature provides a strong clue as to the nature of the interstellar medium .",
    "the subsection on co examines a number of possible explanations for its absence , and results in a similar conclusion regarding the ism .",
    "a summary is provided at the end of this section .",
    "it is important to note that in the direction along the ( ns ) slit the continuum source was partially resolved at ukirt and therefore we are assured that it has a characteristic dimension of a few tens of parsecs .",
    "thus the bulk of the material producing the 3.4  @xmath0 m absorption feature and not producing co absorption lies 10  pc or more from the central engine .",
    "dust and gas in the central few parsecs can only be a minor contributor to the present spectrum and our arguments as to the nature of the interstellar medium therefore apply to the more extended region and not to the  core \" or the innermost region of the torus observed via interferometry .",
    "the spectral profile of the 3.4  @xmath0 m feature is well characterized in the current data .",
    "overall the profile is smooth , showing only the two principal sub - features seen in galactic sources , those at 3.420  @xmath0 m and 3.485  @xmath0 m .",
    "the profile in ngc  1068 contains no evidence of a distinct 3.385  @xmath0 m sub - feature , which is sometimes present in galactic sources and sometimes blended with the 3.420  @xmath0 m feature @xcite .",
    "the data also reveal that the depth of the 3.4  @xmath0 m feature has a similar north - south variation across the nucleus as the 9.7  @xmath0 m silicate absorption ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chsil ] ) .",
    "both features are at maximum depth on and just to the south of the nucleus .",
    "the similarity is also quantitative ; the fractional increase in the depth of each feature at its maximum compared to the depth at adjacent locations is @xmath140 percent .",
    "_ this indicates that the carriers of the features are significantly mixed . _",
    "the compactness and nuclear location of the region of enhanced 3.4  @xmath0 m and silicate extinction suggests that the extra absorption to the south occurs quite close to the nucleus . in the silicate feature",
    "the weaker off - nuclear absorption extends over 2  to the north and south . because the 3  @xmath0 m continuum source is much more compact , the depth of the 3.4  @xmath0 m feature",
    "could not be measured more than 0.4  distant from the nucleus . the lower level and",
    "more extended silicate feature largely arises in a circumnuclear region of much larger dimensions than the torus - like structures seen with mid - ir interferometry .",
    "it may be associated with material in the disk of the host galaxy , which crosses the line of sight south of the nucleus .",
    "the distinction between these two regions is not necessarily sharp @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the optical depths of the 3.4  @xmath0 m and silicate features at the infrared continuum peak of ngc  1068 is 0.19  @xmath15  0.02 . in the galaxy",
    "the silicate feature is found in both diffuse and dense interstellar clouds , whereas the hydrocarbon feature is found only in diffuse clouds . in diffuse clouds",
    "far from the galactic center the ratio of optical depths of the two features can be derived from their optical depths relative to @xmath48 , @xmath48/@xmath49  @xmath50  18.5 @xcite and @xmath48/@xmath51  @xmath50  250 @xcite , yielding @xmath52@xmath53@xmath49  =  0.07  @xmath15  0.01 , a value roughly forty percent of that measured in ngc  1068 . toward the galactic center , where @xmath48  @xmath50  30  mag ) , the value of @xmath52/@xmath49 averaged over sources observed by both @xcite and @xcite is 0.064  @xmath15  0.017 , the same as the above value to within the uncertainties .",
    "the ratio _ in just the diffuse gas on the galactic center sightline _ may be estimated as follows .",
    "@xcite find @xmath48/@xmath52  =  156  @xmath1516 and @xcite find @xmath49  = 3.6  @xmath15  0.3 .",
    "however , one - third of the visual extinction to the galactic center is believed to occur in dense clouds , located mostly in intervening spiral arms @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , for values of @xmath48@xmath2212  mag the ratio of visual extinction to silicate optical depth is the same in dense clouds as in diffuse clouds , and thus we associate those 10  mag of dense cloud visual extinction with a silicate optical depth of 0.54 .",
    "this gives @xmath52/@xmath49  @xmath50  0.23/3.06  =  0.075 for galactic center diffuse clouds , again far less than the ratio toward the nucleus of ngc  1068 .",
    "even if half of the silicate optical depth toward the galactic center arises in the dense clouds in the galactic disk , the above ratio would only be 0.15 , less than the value in ngc  1068 .",
    "clearly then , the 3.4  @xmath0 m absorption in ngc  1068 is unusually strong relative to the silicate absorption .",
    "this can not be explained away by placing the 3.4  @xmath0 m absorber in a more remote location than the silicate feature , because even in galactic diffuse clouds the optical depth of 0.08 observed in ngc  1068 , corresponds to a silicate optical depth @xmath541 , significantly larger than is observed .",
    "the high ratio could be the result of the silicate absorption being significantly filled in , as might arise if thermal emission close to the agn were absorbed in the cooler outer portions of the source .",
    "because such filling in would be much less for the 3.4  @xmath0 m feature , the similar variation in optical depths of the features across the nucleus tends to argue that this is not the entire explanation , however . as suggested by @xcite ,",
    "the high ratio could be explained , at least in part , by the typical continuum surface at 3.4  @xmath0 m lying interior to the typical surface at 9.7  @xmath0 m such that the added pathlength , unobservable at 9.7  @xmath0 m , contains a significant fraction of the observed column density of the 3.4  @xmath0 m absorber .",
    "the result also could be a consequence of either unusual elemental abundances or the chemistry of the dust in the vicinity of the agn .",
    "the co fundamental band has been searched for previously without success in ngc  1068 at spectral resolutions ranging from 20  km  s@xmath4 to 250  km  s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the current data , obtained at 150  km  s@xmath4 resolution , significantly tightens the limit on absorption by co in the warm and presumably rapidly moving gas just outside of the 35  @xmath0 m continuum - emitting dust , whose fwhm along the ionization cones is @xmath120  pc . in its lack of detectable co in this band ngc  1068 is similar to the five other type 2 seyferts studied by @xcite , although the limits on co absorption in those galaxies are considerably less strict .",
    "we consider three possible explanations for the lack of strong co absorption lines toward the agn in ngc  1068 : ( 1 ) the molecules are distributed among many rotational states ; ( 2 ) the molecules reside in a clumpy obscuring medium ; and ( 3 ) there is a paucity of  dense cloud \" molecular gas in front of the agn .",
    "to explain the non - detection of transitions of co , oh and h@xmath46co lines from low rotational levels towards the highly obscured nucleus of cygnus  a at radio wavelengths , it has been pointed out that at the temperatures of the nuclear clouds the lowest rotational levels may contain only a small fraction of the molecules @xcite .",
    "for example , in lte at 300  k roughly twenty rotational levels of co have populations within a factor of ten of that of the most populated level , whereas at 25  k only the six lowest levels are so highly populated .",
    "it also has been suggested by these authors that under some circumstances a strong and compact nuclear radio source could redistribute the rotational level populations in the surrounding gas , further weakening the strengths of lines from the low rotational levels .",
    "@xcite find this explanation unlikely , however , because the 19% of their sources in which high - excitation oh lines are detected also show absorption from the ground state transition .    in the case of ngc  1068 ,",
    "whose 35  @xmath0 m continuum - emitting dust , and presumably the gas associated with this dust , are at temperatures of several hundred kelvins , the lte fractional populations in the low lying levels normally observed at radio and millimeter wavelengths would be much less than in galactic dense clouds .",
    "this can not be the explanation for the non - detection of the co fundamental band lines , however , as the @xmath13 band spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] encompasses lines with a wide range of lower state energies ( corresponding to @xmath26  =  130 in the case of the p branch ) .",
    "the second possibility is that , although there is a large amount of molecular material along the line of sight to the nuclear continuum source , it is concentrated into clumps that cover only a small fraction of the source .",
    "each individual clump produces deep co lines but as most of the continuum source is unobscured , the net effect is much weaker co absorption .",
    "such small cloud volume filling factors have been invoked in order to explain the mid - infrared observational properties of seyfert  1 and seyfert  2 galaxies in the unified model ( in particular the lack of silicate emission in the former and the broad spectral range of the far - infrared continuum ; * ? ? ?",
    "small filling factors for toroids surrounding agns are also predicted by the hydrodynamic simulations of @xcite .",
    "if the detectability of co absorption is related to the cloud filling factor , then for similar total extinction co should be detected in objects with smooth obscuration ( i.e. , covering the entire nuclear continuum source ) , but not in those with clumpy obscuration .",
    "@xcite propose that clumpy and smooth obscuration in agn can be separated on the basis of the strength of the 10 and 18  @xmath0 m silicate features .",
    "strong co absorption , in gas that is warm and presumably close to the nuclear source , has been detected in several agn - hosting ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) @xcite , whose silicate features would classify their dust distribution as smooth , whereas in the single seyfert 2 ulirg whose spectrum would classify it as clumpy , only a weak co band has been tentatively detected @xcite .",
    "this may suggest that the strength of the molecular absorption in agn is indeed governed by the clumpiness of the obscuring medium , but a stringent test of this hypothesis will require a larger sample of objects spanning a wide range of dust geometries .",
    "nevertheless , the presence in ngc  1068 of the 3.4  @xmath0 m feature , whose spatial behavior suggests that much of it arises in the same gas as much of the silicate feature , close to the agn , raises immediate complications with the clumpy model .",
    "that model has the dust and gas local to the agn residing in dense clouds with a small filling factor , so that the silicate absorption , which is strong in each clump , is both diluted and filled in by emission @xcite .",
    "the co absorption lines would also be diluted by this arrangement , apparently to undetectability in the case of ngc  1068 .",
    "however , the absence of the 3.4  @xmath0 m band in galactic dense molecular clouds suggests that in ngc  1068 the carrier of that band would not reside in such clumps , and thus that a second , more diffuse medium is needed for it ( ignoring , for the moment the evidence that the carriers of the two dust features are mixed ) .",
    "the diffuse material could , for example , be a low - density interclump medium .",
    "however , the 3.4  @xmath0 m band in galactic diffuse clouds is invariably accompanied by a silicate absorption feature .",
    "as pointed out earlier , the previously estimated value of @xmath52/@xmath49 in the diffuse interstellar medium toward the galactic center , when applied to ngc  1068 , implies that most or all of silicate absorption in ngc  1068 must arise in that material carrying the 3.4  @xmath0 m band .    the by now almost inevitable solution to these problems is the third explanation : at 313  @xmath0 m essentially all of the absorbing material in the line of sight has the chemical characteristics of galactic diffuse clouds . in this explanation",
    "clumpy absorbing material is not needed to account for the lack of detectable co , because in diffuse clouds co is mostly dissociated , comprising only one percent of the carbon .",
    "diffuse clouds do have large molecular components , with h@xmath5 accounting for typically half of the hydrogen ; thus h@xmath5 should be available to provide the line emission observed by @xcite .",
    "the dust grains in diffuse clouds are comprised of a refractory component responsible for the 3.4  @xmath0 m feature and a silicate component .",
    "gas densities in galactic diffuse clouds are 101000  @xmath29 .",
    "densities in the inner few tens of parsecs of ngc  1068 might be greater than this .",
    "however , at distances of only a few tens of parsecs from a luminous agn it may well be possible that somewhat denser gas also has the above characteristics .",
    "as discussed earlier , in the galaxy fairly tight relationships have been found between the visual extinction in the diffuse ism and the depth of the 3.4  @xmath0 m feature @xcite for sightlines to the galactic center and to local diffuse clouds .",
    "here we employ the former relationship , @xmath48/@xmath52  =  150 . using it we estimate a typical visual extinction of 12  mag to the 3.4  @xmath0 m continuum - emitting region , implying for a normal gas - to - dust ratio that @xmath55(h )  =  2.3  @xmath6  10@xmath7  @xmath8 .",
    "then , assuming that , as in galactic diffuse clouds , one percent of the carbon is in co , and also ( conservatively ) that the typical continuum surface at 3.4  @xmath0 m and 4.7  @xmath0 m are at the same depth , @xmath55(co )  =  6  @xmath6  10@xmath56  @xmath8 , which is consistent with the upper limit of @xmath57  10@xmath28  @xmath8 set by these observations .",
    "the above column density of hydrogen is much less than the column density that attenuates our view of the central engine , @xmath55(h )  @xmath14  10@xmath58  @xmath8 @xcite , but much of that gas must be interior to the dust that is emitting the observed 35  @xmath0 m continuum .",
    "we have found that the 3.4  @xmath0 m hydrocarbon and 9.7  @xmath0 m silicate bands have spatial variations that are similar across the central 0.2  @xmath6  0.8  arcsecond of ngc  1068 and that only a small fraction of interstellar carbon in this region can be in the form of co. the first finding indicates that the carriers of the 3.4  @xmath0 m and 9.7  @xmath0 m bands are largely mixed and that significant fractions of each are located in material very close to the nucleus . in the galaxy both features are present in diffuse interstellar clouds , but the 3.4  @xmath0 m band is _ only _ observed there .",
    "the fraction of co in diffuse clouds is small and our observed upper limit in ngc  1068 is consistent with such a location .",
    "measurable co absorption would be present if even a modest fraction of the silicate absorption arose in fully molecular material .",
    "the straightforward conclusion is that _ the 3 - 13  @xmath0 m absorption spectrum of ngc  1068 is produced in material chemically similar to the galactic diffuse interstellar medium . _",
    "we reiterate the significance of the lack of detection of co and its incompatibility with models employing clumps of _ dense molecular _ material , even if such material near an agn is capable of producing the 3.4  @xmath0 m feature .",
    "if the filling factor of such fully molecular clumps were low enough to  dilute \" the co band to non - detection , as observed , similar dilutions would occur for the silicate and 3.4  @xmath0 m absorptions , contradicting the observations .",
    "the adaptive optics measurements of @xcite show that nuclear thermal infrared continuum arises in part from numerous clumps covering a few tens of parsecs .",
    "if the source of the 3 - 13  @xmath0 m continuum is dominated by such clumps , then absorbing material could either be located on surfaces of the clumps or be more continuously distributed in front of them . however , if a significant portion of the continuum is emitted by an extended component , the present observations constrain the degree of clumpiness in the absorbing material . in that case a low , e.g. @xmath220.1 , filling factor for the absorbing clumps probably would be inconsistent with the observed strength of the 3.4  @xmath0 m feature , as it would imply , e.g. , @xmath59(3.4  @xmath0 m )  @xmath14  0.8 in the clumps . the maximum observed optical depth of the feature is 0.5 , in the deeply buried ulirg iras  08572 + 3915 @xcite .",
    "the observations reported here bear largely on two important issues : ( 1 ) the ionization mechanism for the high excitation coronal line emission close to the agn ; and ( 2 ) the nature of the dusty environment absorbing the infrared continuum of the agn . regarding the ionized gas , the evidence appears to both favor collisional excitation of the bulk of the coronal line emission and , in view of the spatial coincidences of the various lines , argue against photoionization . regarding the absorbing material , the simplest explanation is that it has much more of the characteristics of diffuse clouds than dense clouds ( clumped or unclumped ) .",
    "the strength of the hydrocarbon feature argues against it being distributed in front of the sources of the continuum with a very low filling factor relative to them . because elsewhere it has always been found that silicate dust is always present where a 3.4  @xmath0 m absorption is observed",
    ", one can conclude that if the latter is not so distributed then neither is the former .",
    "finally , it should be noted that in ngc  1068 the extended source of the 35  @xmath0 m continuum radiation has a characteristic north - south dimension of @xmath120  pc , indicating that the bulk of the continuum emission occurs at distances of @xmath110  pc or more from the central engine .",
    "this distance is much greater than that estimated under the assumption that the temperature of the dust is determined principally by the luminosity of the agn and its distance .",
    "using an agn luminosity of 1.5  @xmath6  10@xmath60  l@xmath12 @xcite , dust grains heated by isotropic radiation from the agn to the observed 35  @xmath0 m color temperatures of @xmath1500  k would lie only @xmath11  pc from the agn .",
    "@xcite has suggested that transient heating of small grains could be responsible for the high temperatures .",
    "we speculate that at least in the north - south direction mechanical heating of the dust and gas , perhaps from the agn jets , could also be important .",

    "<S> together with the broadened line profiles observed near that location , this suggests that shock - ionization is the dominant excitation mechanism of the coronal lines . </S>",
    "<S> the depth of the 3.4  @xmath0 m hydrocarbon absorption is maximum at and just south of the continuum peak , similar to the 10  @xmath0 m silicate absorption . that and the similar and rapid variations of the optical depths of both features across the nucleus suggest that substantial portions of both arise in a dusty environment just in front of the continuum source(s ) . </S>",
    "<S> a new and tighter limit is set on the column density of co. although clumpy models of the dust screen might explain the shallowness of the silicate feature , the presence of the 3.4  @xmath0 m feature and the absence of co are strongly reminiscent of galactic diffuse cloud environments and a consistent explanation for them and the observed silicate feature is found if all three phenomena occur in such an environment , existing as close as 10  pc to the central engine . </S>"
