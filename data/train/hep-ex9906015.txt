    "in the standard model the tau lepton and the tau neutrino form the third generation weak doublet of leptons .",
    "most observations are consistent with zero mass for each of the three types of neutrino , and with the conservation of lepton number for each of @xmath29 separately .",
    "these suppositions , however , should be tested , especially in the light of recent indications @xcite of oscillations among the neutrino species .    there are model dependent limits on the possible values of the tau neutrino mass . the superkamiokande experiment @xcite measures the ratio of rates for @xmath30 and @xmath31 from decay products of particles produced in cosmic ray collisions in the atmosphere .",
    "the deficit in the @xmath30 rate , along with its dependence upon neutrino zenith angle and energy , can be interpreted as due to oscillation of the @xmath30 to @xmath32 with a maximal amplitude ( @xmath33 ) and a frequency determined by @xmath34 ev@xmath35 at 90% confidence .",
    "this would imply , if the @xmath32 mass were much larger than the @xmath30 mass , that @xmath36    astrophysical observations and cosmological theory limit the energy density of the universe , thus restricting the sum of _ stable _ neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "this leads to the limit @xmath37 this limit not only depends on @xmath32 being stable , but also varies with the value of the hubble constant and other inputs .",
    "the possible effects of the tau neutrino on big - bang nucleosynthesis lead to either a low mass @xmath32 or to a decaying @xmath32 at higher mass @xcite : @xmath38 the width of the excluded region increases with the lifetime of the @xmath32 and also depends on the assumed abundance of light elements .    the standard model relations among the @xmath39 and @xmath40 masses and lifetimes and some @xmath39 branching fractions @xcite imply @xmath41    the popular see - saw mechanism for generating neutrino masses @xcite postulates the relation @xmath42 this would imply rather weak limits on the @xmath32 mass : @xmath43 @xmath44    the model dependences in all of these limits on the @xmath32 mass argue for a more direct measurement .",
    "the observation of the decay of accelerator produced taus along with measurements of the energy and momentum of the detectable daughter products ( all but the @xmath32 ) can constrain the possible values for @xmath45 , especially in cases when the effective mass of the detected particles is close to @xmath46 . because the cross section for @xmath47 production is up to 15% of the total @xmath48 annihilation cross section ,",
    "an electron - positron collider is a natural choice for the source of taus .",
    "one looks for a hadronic decay mode with only one neutrino in the final state .",
    "most of the previous measurements ( see table [ tlimits ] ) have been made with the higher multiplicity decay modes in which the effective mass of the hadrons is more likely to be close to the kinematic limit @xmath46 with the maximum sensitivity to @xmath45 .",
    "all such decay modes are strongly phase - space suppressed , however , and the branching fractions are very low .",
    "an alternative strategy , which we use in the present measurement , is to pick a decay mode with a lower hadron multiplicity but with a much larger branching fraction .",
    "although the four - pion decay , @xmath49 , relative to the five - pion decay , produces a smaller proportion of events in which the effective hadronic mass is close to @xmath46 , the branching fraction is 4.2% , as compared to @xmath50 for the higher multiplicity modes .",
    "the experiment was performed using the cornell electron - positron storage ring and the cleo ii detector , described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "charged particle tracks were reconstructed in three nested cylindrical drift chambers in a solenoid field of 1.5 tesla . the mean - squared resolution in momentum transverse to the beam was @xmath51 .",
    "photon and electron showers were detected over 98% of @xmath52 steradians in an array of 7800 csi scintillation counters with an energy resolution of @xmath53 ( @xmath54 in gev ) in the central region of polar angle , @xmath55 .",
    "ionization , time of flight , and shower energy aided in lepton identification .",
    "the data used in the present analysis were from 4.75 fb@xmath56 of accumulated luminosity , two thirds at 10.58 gev and one third at 10.52 gev @xmath48 center of mass energies .",
    "this corresponds to 4.3 million @xmath47 pairs produced .",
    "we determined event selection criteria using monte carlo simulated signal and background data samples .",
    "we selected the one - versus - three track topology with zero net charge , that is , events containing a three - charged - track tau decay candidate tagged by a single - prong decay in the opposite hemisphere .",
    "tracks were accepted in the polar angle range @xmath57 .",
    "the three signal tracks each had to have @xmath58 and had to fail electron identification criteria @xcite .",
    "the tag track had to have momentum greater than @xmath59 and had to be consistent with one of four possible decay modes : @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 or the charge conjugates .",
    "this resulted in a data sample of @xmath64 thousand tagged three - prong tau decay candidates .",
    "on the three - prong side each event was required to have a @xmath65 , defined as two csi calorimeter showers in the polar angle range @xmath66 , not matched to charged tracks , with lateral shower profiles consistent with photons , and with effective mass in the range @xmath67 mev .",
    "the @xmath65 in the decay of the @xmath68 in the @xmath69 tag channel also had to satisfy these requirements , along with @xmath70 mev for each photon and @xmath71 gev .",
    "non - photon calorimeter showers can make false @xmath65 candidates .",
    "these typically originate from nuclear interactions of the charged pions in the csi crystals producing secondaries isolated from any charged track .",
    "if several @xmath65 candidates were found on the three - prong side of an event , we kept only the one with the highest energy .",
    "we rejected events with an extra shower of more than 300 mev or , if photon - like in lateral shower shape , of more than 100 mev .",
    "the @xmath65 selection cuts reduced the data sample to 31,305 events .    in order to minimize background from the two - photon process ,",
    "for example @xmath72 with the final @xmath73 and @xmath74 escaping detection at small angles to the beam , we rejected events in which the net event momentum transverse to the beam was less than 150 mev .",
    "the final data set included 29,058 events .    no particle identification information was used on the charged particles .",
    "that is , decay modes in which a @xmath75 substitutes for a @xmath76 were considered part of the @xmath77 signal .",
    "these modes contributed about 5% of the signal ( see table [ tmodes ] ) .",
    "the four - pion final state includes @xmath78 , at 3% of the total .",
    "the bulk of the signal is @xmath49 ( and charge conjugate ) . in about 53% of the events",
    "there is a @xmath79 combination ( fig .",
    "[ fomega ] ) with a mass consistent with the @xmath80 ( there are two possibilities per event ) . the two - pion mass spectra ( fig .",
    "[ ftwopi ] ) for events with no @xmath80 show @xmath81 peaks in @xmath82 ( @xmath83 per event ) , @xmath84 ( 17% per event ) , and @xmath85 ( @xmath86 per event ) . the overall four - pion mass spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ ffourpi ] ) has a broad maximum around 1.2 to 1.4 gev for the @xmath87 events , and a peak at 1.4 gev for the rest of the events .",
    "there is no obvious resonance structure in @xmath88 , although the two four - pion spectra fit well each to a sum of @xmath89 , and @xmath90 with adjustable relative amplitudes and phases .",
    "conservation of energy and momentum imply that @xmath91 the beam energy @xmath92 and the energy @xmath93 and effective mass @xmath94 of the hadronic ( four - pion ) system are measured in each event , and @xmath95 mev is known @xcite .",
    "thus if we fix @xmath45 , for each allowed value of the scaled hadronic mass @xmath96 there is a range of kinematically allowed values of the scaled hadronic energy @xmath97 , where the limits are obtained by taking the last term to be at its @xmath98 limits .",
    "figure  [ fxy ] shows the distribution of the data in @xmath99 and the boundary curves for two values of @xmath45 .",
    "even though there is background outside the kinematically allowed region , it is clear that the two - dimensional distribution of the data is sensitive to the value of @xmath45 .",
    "more precisely , the likelihood of the observed @xmath99 event distribution , including background , plotted for various assumed @xmath45 values , can give information on which @xmath45 values are consistent with experiment .",
    "we define the likelihood for an individual event observed at @xmath100 as the probability density @xmath101 of observing such an event assuming @xmath45 to be the neutrino mass .",
    "@xmath101 contains terms for signal and backgrounds .",
    "the likelihood for the entire data sample is then the product of the event likelihoods : @xmath102 _ signal likelihood . _",
    "we first discuss the signal contribution to the single - event probability density @xmath101 .",
    "it can be expressed as the product of the spectral function ( decay probability density ) @xmath103 and detection efficiency @xmath104 at the true @xmath99 , convolved with the experimental resolution function @xmath105 derived from data for that event : @xmath106 for convenience we have expressed @xmath107 in terms of the spectral function for @xmath108 and a weight function that takes account of the dependence of @xmath103 on @xmath45 . the weight function @xmath109 is determined from the known effect of a non - zero neutrino mass on the phase space and the kinematic boundary .",
    "it is zero outside the allowed region",
    ".    the spectral function @xmath110 is obtained by adjusting a physics motivated 14-parameter function @xcite to match distributions in the simulated data and the real data over the range @xmath111 , where we have verified by monte carlo that the choice of @xmath103 does not bias the determination of @xmath45 .",
    "the function so determined is then used in the entire @xmath112 range .",
    "it includes adjustable amplitudes and phases for @xmath113 and for @xmath114 in all charge combinations .",
    "the @xmath113 and @xmath114 mass spectra are each a superposition of @xmath115 , and @xmath90 resonances .",
    "the masses and widths of the resonances are fixed .",
    "we adjust the parameters by comparing distributions in simulated data , including the effects of detector acceptance and resolution , and in real data with estimated tau and non - tau backgrounds subtracted .",
    "figures  [ ftwopi ] and [ ffourpi ] illustrate the goodness of the fit .",
    "we compute the resolution function @xmath105 separately for each event .",
    "the scale of the spreading in @xmath116 and @xmath117 , including @xmath99 correlation , is obtained by propagating the resolution error matrices from the individual track and shower fits .",
    "we obtain a parametrized non - gaussian shape from monte carlo .",
    "the width and shape lead to distributions that match data for the reconstructed mass of @xmath118 , and @xmath119 .",
    "the projected distributions of r.m.s .",
    "resolutions in hadronic mass and energy peak at 11 and 17 mev in the region near the kinematic endpoint . by using the resolution function appropriate for each event instead of an averaged one",
    ", we diminish the effect of fluctuations from poorly measured events near the kinematic boundary .",
    "we evaluate the integral for each event by monte carlo , using a geant @xcite simulation of physical processes in the cleo detector .",
    "that is , we first generate about 1 million simulated signal events using the koralb event generator@xcite , tagged @xmath49 , according to the distribution @xmath110 .",
    "then for each observed real event @xmath120 and for each assumed value of @xmath45 we form the following sum over all the monte carlo events that contribute : @xmath121 we take account of the efficiency factor @xmath104 by omitting the monte carlo events that are not detected by the simulated cleo detector or recognized by the event selection criteria .",
    "the monte carlo integration technique enables us to include in @xmath122 the effect of initial state radiation , @xmath123 .",
    "radiative events have a lower effective @xmath92 causing them to be produced with lower apparent @xmath124 .",
    "some of them can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fxy ] below the lower no - radiation kinematic limit .",
    "the monte carlo also includes the appropriate number of events from the @xmath125 and @xmath75-for-@xmath76 substitution modes ( see table [ tmodes ] ) .",
    "_ background likelihood .",
    "_ we distinguish three types of significant background : ( a ) events from the two - photon process that are not eliminated by our transverse momentum cut , ( b ) @xmath47 events that do not contain our signal modes , and ( c ) non-@xmath39 hadronic events from @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "the two - photon events , such as @xmath128 in which the hadronic state has enough transverse momentum to be accepted , form a background at low scaled hadron energy @xmath124 that is difficult to model reliably .",
    "since this kinematic region is insensitive to @xmath45 , the best strategy is to eliminate it from the likelihood fit .",
    "the detector efficiency is also less accurately modeled at low @xmath129 and low @xmath124 , so we restrict the fit to @xmath129@xmath1300.7 ,  @xmath124@xmath1300.7 . within this region the two - photon background can be neglected , and the detailed choice of boundary has no influence on the @xmath45 limit .",
    "the cut reduces the number of data events used in the fit to 16,577 .",
    "tau decays of higher or lower multiplicity can masquerade as our signal mode if particles escape undetected and/or secondaries in the csi crystal array are misinterpreted as photons from a @xmath65 .",
    "we evaluate these and other mis - reconstruction effects by monte carlo simulation of the response of the cleo detector to 12 million @xmath47 events generated with the known branching fractions . of the accepted data events in the fit region , 7.3% are from tau background .",
    "they are mainly @xmath131 with a spurious @xmath65 .",
    "although most hadronic @xmath126 annihilation events are rejected by our one - versus - three charged track criterion , some of them can survive .",
    "the @xmath132 contamination in our data sample was evaluated by a 36-million event monte carlo simulation using the lund@xcite generator .",
    "the simulation has been extensively tuned to produce results that agree with experiment . in particular , we have verified the agreement between data and monte carlo for the events satisfying the one - versus - three topology but having a tag with an energy that could not come from @xmath39 decay , and for the events that have @xmath129 values well above the kinematic limit for the signal @xmath39 mode .",
    "the @xmath132 background accounts for 3.1% of the accepted data events in the fit region .",
    "the calculation of the background contribution @xmath133 to the individual event likelihood is similar to the calculation of @xmath122 .",
    "however , since the expected background event distribution ( the analog of @xmath134 ) can be expressed only in terms of observed @xmath135 , it is not appropriate to integrate over the experimental resolution function ; its effect is already contained in the distribution . as the distribution is not an analytic function , but a collection of simulated events with a rather smooth distribution , we approximate the value of @xmath136 for the @xmath120-th data event by the number ( appropriately weighted ) of @xmath47 and @xmath132 background monte carlo events per unit area in the @xmath99 vicinity of @xmath135 .",
    "this @xmath133 is of course independent of @xmath45 .",
    "we sum the signal and background likelihoods for each event and take the product over all events in the region @xmath137 , @xmath138 to form the net likelihood @xmath139 .",
    "this is repeated for a range of assumed @xmath45 values to obtain @xmath140 .",
    "( as used in ref .",
    "@xcite ) is not used here because the large number of events in the fit region of this work is insensitive to the neutrino mass scale in question . ]",
    "the overall normalization of @xmath140 is arbitrary .",
    "figure  [ flvsm](a ) shows the likelihood as a function of assumed neutrino mass .",
    "the integral under the curve beyond 22 mev is 5% of the total . before interpreting this as a 95% upper limit on @xmath45 , however , we have to consider systematic uncertainties that could affect the limit .",
    "the cleo charged particle momentum measurement scale is uncertain by about 0.05% , and the @xmath65 energy scale is uncertain by 0.25% .",
    "this shows up as a potential mismatch between monte carlo and data , resulting in a distortion in @xmath140 .",
    "variations in scale of these magnitudes cause a shift of 5.0 mev in the 95% limit , when the two effects are combined in quadrature .",
    "the four - pion spectral function @xmath103 was determined by varying the contributions of the @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath90 to match the data below @xmath143 , then extrapolating into the region @xmath144 sensitive to @xmath45 . )",
    ", we would get a ( biased ) 95% limit of 17 mev for @xmath45 .",
    "this is significant in that it represents the lowest limit one could _ a priori _ expect to obtain with the given statistical accuracy and background , assuming @xmath108 . ]",
    "the resulting likelihood function ( fig .",
    "[ flvsm ] ) is sensitive mainly to the parameters describing the @xmath90 .",
    "if we vary the amplitude within the experimental accuracy of our matching and the @xmath90 mass and width within their experimental errors , we can raise the 95% likelihood limit by 4 mev .",
    "the effects of other systematic uncertainties have been similarly evaluated .",
    "the resulting shifts of the 95% limit on @xmath45 are listed in table [ tsyserr ] .",
    "assuming that the various effects are independent , we combine the limit shifts in quadrature to get a net systematic shift of 6.4 mev . following the practice in reports of previous experiments on @xmath45 limits , we add this shift linearly to the raw limit from fig .",
    "[ flvsm ] : @xmath145 an important difference between this measurement and @xmath32 mass limits from previous @xmath48 experiments is the size of the event sample used .",
    "we observe 543 events in the sensitive portion of the kinematically allowed region , @xmath146 .",
    "this and the fact that we include background in the fit lead to a limit that has little sensitivity to chance fluctuations in the population of individual events near the endpoint .",
    "although this experiment has its own statistical and systematic uncertainties that prevent a significant improvement in the limit value , the analysis is quite complementary to previous low statistics experiments and confirms their conclusions .",
    "both this measurement and the previous cleo measurement @xcite using @xmath147 show a broad likelihood maximum near the higher end of the allowed range of the tau neutrino mass .",
    "since such a behavior is not unlikely even if @xmath108 ( as verified by monte carlo experiments ) , we do not regard it as significant .",
    "it does imply , however , that combining the results of the two cleo measurements to make a joint likelihood curve does not significantly improve the mass limit .",
