    "the stars observed in the universe tend to cluster in huge self - gravitating systems , being the galaxies among the most noticeable and studied of them .",
    "galaxies can be described by models whose mass is distributed symmetrically about an axis to a finite distance of it i.e. , the galaxy radius .",
    "particularly useful models are those restricted to a plane or thin disk , since for many galaxies like the milky way its height is small compared to its radius . for galaxies in general , the average time between collisions or individual meetings ( mean collision time ) is greater than the system s life time .",
    "many of the current models take newton s law as their field equations @xcite .",
    "however , many models have been developed recently under general relativity @xcite , being one of the main motivations for including corrections made by general relativity the actual incompatibility between the rotation curves of theoretical models and the ones observed .",
    "the post - newtonian approximation introduces general relativity through a series over the speed @xmath0 . for minkowski s background metric , the first post - newtonian corrections ( 1pn )",
    "are included taking the terms @xmath1 where the upper index denotes the order of the power of @xmath0 of the term . using harmonic coordinates ,",
    "the 1pn order potentials are defined as @xmath2 henceforth we consider only the stationary case , so the explicit time - dependent terms along with the potential vector @xmath3 disappear in all equations .",
    "the stationary field equations in the 1pn approximation are @xmath4 where , in the classical limit , potential @xmath5 vanishes and @xmath6 tends to the newtonian potential @xmath7 . whereas that @xmath8 \\label{ecmovimiento1pn}\\ ] ] is the stationary equation of motion .",
    "a complete statistical description is achieved by knowing the distribution function ( df ) of the system .",
    "the df satisfies a continuity equation in the phase space called the boltzmann equation . in the 1pn approximation , the collisionless boltzmann equation ( cbe ) for a many identical particles system",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath9 according to jeans theorem @xcite , the solution of colissionless boltzmann equation is any function of the integrals of motion .",
    "now , it is easy to verify that two isolated integrals a 1pn system with axial symmetry are given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 which can be interpreted as the 1pn generalizations of energy and the @xmath13 component of angular momentum , respectively .",
    "in addition , the df must satisfy the condition of self - consistently generating the macroscopic mean values . in the post - newtonian approximation , the following components of the energy - momentum tensor are need , @xmath14 therefore , in the post - newtonian approximation , self - consistent equilibrium models are defined by two scalar potentials , @xmath6 and @xmath5 , together with a df that satisfies 1pn cbe and relations ( [ t000 ] ) - ( [ t002 ] ) generating self - consistenly the 1pn components of the energy - momentum tensor . in this paper",
    "we present a method to obtain post - newtonian axially symmetric equilibrium models .",
    "the method uses thin disk models , allowing to solve the two differential equations with the hunter s method @xcite , as shown in the next section .",
    "the solution of the field equations is obtained considering equations in vacuum , in which case , the energy - momentum tensor vanishes and the content of matter is expressed as a boundary condition on the fields in the disk , as shown below .",
    "finally , in section [ s_apli_mod ] the first axially symmetric models in the 1pn approximation are presented .",
    "for thin disks of finite radius the components of the energy - momentum tensor can be written as @xmath15 for @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the dirac delta function , and being zero for @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the field equations reduce to two laplace equations for the fields @xmath6 and @xmath5 . it is demanded that the fields are even functions of @xmath13 @xmath19 and therefore , that the first derivatives with respect to @xmath13 are odd functions of @xmath13 .    using gauss theorem with ( [ t000-sigma ] ) and ( [ tii02-sigma ] ) gives ,",
    "@xmath20 the problem is defined with the following boundary conditions : fields vanish at infinity , and at @xmath21 its derivatives depend on the energy - momentum tensor components according to ( [ sigma - phi ] ) and ( [ sigma - psi ] ) for @xmath22 and vanishing for @xmath18 .",
    "applying hunter s method to each of the 1pn field equations , one can obtain exact analytical expressions for the potentials .",
    "the hunter s method consists on obtaining solutions of the laplace equation in oblate spheroidal coordinates .",
    "the oblate coordinates are related to the cylindrical by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the disk is placed at @xmath26 , where , @xmath27 .    following hunter @xcite , the general solution of each laplace equation satisfying previous boundary conditions",
    "can be written as @xmath28 for the @xmath6 potential , and @xmath29 for the @xmath5 potential , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the constants required for each model , @xmath32 are the legendre polynomials and @xmath33 are legendre functions of second kind . note that when using classical models , the expression for @xmath6 can be written taking constants of the form @xmath34 where the @xmath35 constants define the newtonian potential @xmath7 and the constants @xmath36 define the correction @xmath37 . so that taking the limit @xmath38 , @xmath39 is reduced to the newtonian part only .",
    "the corresponding expressions for @xmath40 and @xmath41 in oblate coordinates are @xmath42 accordingly , @xmath40 can also be writen as the sum of a newtonian part and a post - newtonian correction : @xmath43 .",
    "in order to obtain self - consistent models of axially symmetric thin disks in equilibrium , it is used a df of the form @xmath44 , which is zero for @xmath18 .",
    "the df reproduces @xmath40 and @xmath41 through the equations @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the integral of motion defined by ( [ ec_ene ] ) . as in the newtonian case",
    ", one could define a relative energy and a relative potential as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a constant that is chosen so that @xmath49 and @xmath50 are always positive , i.e. , such that @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "the method to obtain self - consistent post - newtonian models is to take ( [ relacion - f - sigma ] ) with ( [ sigma1 ] ) as the first fundamental equation and ( [ relacion - f - sigma ] ) with ( [ sigma1 ] ) as the second fundamental equation . in accordance with the order of magnitude of the approach",
    ", the second fundamental equation is solved using the newtonian terms and then the first fundamental equation is solved using the terms up to 1pn order .",
    "finally , note that for the second fundamental equation , the constants can be obtained directly by @xmath53 where the integral depends on the particular model . on the other hand , in the first fundamental equation",
    ", the constants also appear on the right side of the equation ( hence , it is necessary to obtain the constants differently for each model ) and , in general , we can not use an explicit expression as done above .",
    "however , it is found that for all models treated it is finally possible to obtain expressions analog to ( [ alphas_despejadas ] ) for the first fundamental equation , see ( [ d0 ] ) - ( [ d4 ] ) and ( [ consphi1pn - kalnajs2 ] ) - ( [ consphi1pn - kalnajs2b ] ) .",
    "the df in the 1pn approximation presents the same functional dependence on the integrals of motion that in the newtonian models , that is , one uses the same df but now with the 1pn energy and angular momentum .",
    "of course , this is for the sake of correspondence with the newtonian limit .",
    "note that the correspondence principle must be satisfied by both the df and its integrals .",
    "it is possible to obtain alternative expressions for @xmath40 and @xmath41 considering in particular the case where the df depends on a linear combination of energy and angular momentum called jacobi s integral , @xmath54 .",
    "jacobi s integral is interpreted classically as the energy measured from a frame of reference rotating with angular speed @xmath55 @xcite . in terms of the relative energy ( [ ec_ene_lz_pn ] )",
    ", we can write jacobi s integral as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the 1pn relative - effective potential evaluated in @xmath58 , defined by @xmath59 the jacobi s integral takes values between zero and @xmath60 , with @xmath61 now , given that @xmath62 , the relation ( [ relacion - f - sigma ] ) can be written as @xmath63 then , by using the expression @xmath64 the second fundamental equation can be written as @xmath65 with @xmath66 given by ( [ sigma1 ] ) with @xmath67 .    finally , the circular speed necessary for the rotation curve can be obtained considering ( [ ecmovimiento1pn ] ) for circular orbits . in that case",
    ", the circular speed is equal to @xmath68 and perpendicular to the gradient of the field @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the 1pn equation of motion ( [ ecmovimiento1pn ] ) reduces to @xmath69_{z=0 } = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r } \\left [ \\phi + \\frac{2 \\phi^{2 } + \\psi}{c^{2 } } \\right]_{z=0}.\\ ] ] then , in accordance with the 1pn order of approximation , the expression for the circular speed is @xmath70 note that in the limit @xmath71 , the previous expression reduces to that of newtonian theory @xmath72 .",
    "we will now apply the previous formalism to the family of generalized kalnajs disks ( gkd ) introduced by gonzlez and reina in @xcite .",
    "this family is characterized by mass densities of the form @xmath73 where the index @xmath74 of the model is any positive integer .",
    "the potential @xmath75 is given by ( [ phi1 ] ) by taking the newtonian limit in ( [ constantesa ] ) and using @xmath76 for @xmath77 , and @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "the first disk of the family , the disk with @xmath80 , is the well known kalnajs disk @xcite , with the mass distribution @xmath81 then , as was shown by kalnajs @xcite , the df depends on the jacobi s integral as @xmath82^{-1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 .",
    "now , for the kalnajs disk it holds that @xmath84 , so that the disk spins like a rigid body .    inserting expressions ( [ dens - kalnajs1 ] ) and ( [ df - kalnajs1 ] ) into the second fundamental equation ( [ relacion - f - sigma - j ] ) , and integrating the df , one easily obtains the following system of equations @xmath85 likewise , for the first fundamental equation we have @xmath86 where @xmath87}{864 \\pi m g}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "therefore , we have a system of linear equations with an upper triangular matrix for the constants of each potential , @xmath5 and @xmath37 .    solving for the constants explicitly",
    ", we obtain @xmath88 which defines the potential @xmath5 , and the correction @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "hence we can get all the parameters of interest , in particular , we observed that the mass correction , @xmath89 , is negligible compared with the classical mass @xmath66 .",
    "in contrast , the 1pn rotation curve obtained with ( [ circular - velocity ] ) , is visibly separated from the newtonian one from a certain radius , the difference being maximum at the edge of the disk ( see fig . [ gkd1 ] ) , where the difference between both reaches @xmath90 approximately .",
    "those have been obtained with the typical values of a galaxy such as the milky way .",
    "the procedure for the second disk is pretty much the same that for the first one .",
    "again , the df has a simple form when written as a function of jacobi s integral , @xmath93 for a mean circular speed @xmath94 .",
    "this df could be easily integrated to self - consistently obtain the mass density of the model , which also can be obtained from ( [ dens - kalnajs ] ) with @xmath95 , @xmath96 the associated gravitational potential is given by the newtonian limit @xmath7 of ( [ phi1 ] ) with ( [ c2n ] ) and @xmath95 .",
    "again , we replace the newtonian terms into the second fundamental equation ( [ relacion - f - sigma - j ] ) to obtain : @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 multiplying ( [ ecfundamental2-kalnajs2 ] ) with a legendre polynomial , integrating with respect to @xmath100 , and using the orthogonality properties of the legendre polynomials we get @xmath101 we also could have used the expression ( [ alphas_despejadas ] ) .    after rearranging the terms ,",
    "the first fundamental equation can be written as @xmath102 - b_{2n } q_{2n}(0 ) p_{2n}(\\eta ) - \\hat{c}_{2n } \\eta^{2n } \\ } = 0 , \\label{ecfundamental1-kalnajs2}\\ ] ] where , @xmath103 integrating and using orthogonality relations , the constants @xmath36 are given by @xmath104 for @xmath105 , and @xmath106 , \\label{consphi1pn - kalnajs2b}\\ ] ] which defines the correction @xmath37 to the newtonian potential .",
    "the mass densities and rotation curves are plotted at figure [ gkd2 ] , note that the rotation curve is not only cuantitative , but cualitatively different , presenting its maximum value more closely to the center of the disk and going upwards at the border .",
    "this is due to the fact that the 1pn curve includes more terms than the newtonian one ."
