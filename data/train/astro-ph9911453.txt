    "optically to date phase - resolved observations of the crab pulsar have been restricted to rudimentary 2-d or single pixel photometers , with variable temporal accuracy .",
    "successes worthy of note include the detection of an unpulsed component by peterson et al .",
    "( 1978 ) , and strong polarisation behaviour as a function of phase - most especially for this same unpulsed component ( smith et al . 1988 ) .",
    "true characterisation of this interesting feature requires multi - band high speed 2-d photometry at @xmath3sec resolution , allowing for the acquisition of accurate phase - resolved photometry .",
    "we outline an analysis of such observations made of the crab pulsar using the triffid high speed photometer ( golden & shearer , 1999 ) .",
    "the triffid camera incorporating a mama detector was used to observe the crab pulsar over 5 nights in january 1996 on the 6 m telescope in the russian caucasus . using the jodrell crab ephemeris ( lyne & pritchard , 1996 ) ,",
    "photons within specific phase regions were selected to produce a sequence of phase - resolved images over the pulsar s light curve .",
    "figure 1 shows such a sequence , and confirms the reported constant emission . via standard image reduction techniques ,",
    "the relative fluxes per light curve component per colour band were determined , and normalized to archival integrated estimates ( percival et al .",
    "flux components per colour band are plotted in figure 1 , and a weighted least squares fit to the unpulsed components indicate a power - law exponent of -0.6 @xmath2 0.4 , the reference integrated photometry contributing most of the associated error .",
    "we have resolved constant emission from the ` off ' phase of the crab light curve .",
    "phenomenologically , the emission is nonthermal and _ steeper _ than that observed for the peaks , although similar to that of the bridge component . whether it is directly related to the latter , or is",
    "a consequence of magnetospheric scattering is not clear .",
    "further observations of this & the vela pulsar may show evidence for a similar unpulsed component of emission , which as yet remains inexplicable in terms of contemporary high energy emission theory ."
