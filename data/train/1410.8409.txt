    "for decades , market participants have attempted to detect potential trends in asset price fluctuations on exchange markets . in systematic trading ,",
    "trend following ( tf ) strategies that generate buy or sell signals to adjust their market exposure according to past price variations , were developed to profit from trends at various time horizons @xcite . while its actual profitability is highly controversial @xcite , trend following remains a widely used strategy among professional asset managers . since many traders search for the same profit opportunities , the expected ( net ) gains are small , especially at short times , and are subject to stochastic fluctuations . in order to enhance profit and reduce risk , fund managers build diversified portfolios , aiming to decorrelate constituent tf strategies as much as possible .",
    "our goal is to show that this conventional approach leads to suboptimal portfolios . in particular , we illustrate that inter - asset correlations , if accounted for properly , facilitate trend detection and thus significantly improve the risk - adjusted portfolio return .    in a previous work , we considered a linear tf strategy applied to an asset with auto - correlated returns @xcite .",
    "this model relies on the ability of market participants to assess market auto - correlation or , equivalently , the excess variance .",
    "an explicit persistence in asset returns was introduced in order to study trend following from a risk - reward perspective .",
    "modeling price persistence by adding a stochastic trend term to a gaussian market model , we derived analytical formulas for the mean and variance of the strategy profit - and - losses ( p&l )",
    ". given market transaction costs , we were able , for instance , to compute a threshold in auto - correlation below which trend follower has no hope to realize profit in real market conditions .",
    "fund managers often use such criteria to select a set of assets / markets that are of interest for trend following trading .",
    "many examples of tf strategies applied to stock markets , foreign exchange markets , and commodities were reported @xcite . in the financial industry ,",
    "diversified funds apply tf strategies to a large number of assets with hope to benefit from the so - called diversification effect @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the model from @xcite to the multivariate case , in which explicit stochastic trends and an inter - asset covariance structure are introduced .",
    "in particular , we study how correlations in the market trends affect the portfolio risk - reward profile . in other words , while asset returns may exhibit a given covariance structure , their trend component may have a different one",
    ". we aim at solving a portfolio optimization problem taking into account the trend following nature of the trading strategies .",
    "our goal is to show that failure to account for trend correlations ( i.e. , only using asset returns covariance ) leads to suboptimal risk - adjusted portfolio return .",
    "starting from the seminal work of markowitz @xcite , modern portfolio theory @xcite brought numerous optimization techniques to the asset allocation problem @xcite .",
    "the initial problem markowitz considered was to find portfolio weights , i.e. , amount of capital allocated to each asset , maximizing a portfolio mean - variance objective given expected market returns and covariance structure .",
    "the markowitz model relies on the ability of market participants to assess expected return and provides a way to incorporate asset covariance into the investment process . in our approach , the asset expected return is substituted by the expected excess variance ( or auto - correlation ) that characterizes market trends @xcite .",
    "we solve the problem of static allocation of dynamic strategies by specifying the correlation structure of trend and noise components of asset price fluctuations . as another approach to the dynamic allocation problem ,",
    "one often considers a sequence of static portfolios in the so - called multi - period markowitz framework @xcite .",
    "we choose simple modeling assumptions from @xcite in an effort to derive an exact solution to the problem :    \\(i ) applying a tf strategy implicitly assumes persistence in price variations .",
    "we model price variations as a stochastic trend plus a white noise .",
    "\\(ii ) real markets exhibit inter - asset ( or cross ) correlations @xcite .",
    "we introduce separately the correlation in trends and the correlation in noises .",
    "for instance , two assets can exhibit similar long - term trends and be negatively correlated on the short term .    under these assumptions , we find that the static allocation problem in which an optimal weight is assigned to each asset , leads to suboptimal risk - adjusted return",
    ". even if the correlations in trend and noise are equal , the application of a classical markowitz approach to tf strategies is suboptimal .",
    "we then formulate a dynamic allocation framework that leads to an improved risk - adjusted return of the portfolio .",
    "our approach to dynamic allocation consists in correcting each strategy signal by a linear combination of other strategy signals .",
    "this cross - correcting term can be seen as a lead - lag correction @xcite .",
    "we show that the allocation problem for @xmath0 dynamic strategies can be reduced to solving a static markowitz problem for a set of @xmath1 virtual assets with explicitly derived expected returns and covariance structure .",
    "we deduce the simple rule of thumb : for two assets @xmath2 and @xmath3 , given their respective strategy signals @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and cross - correlation @xmath6 between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , one should adjust the exposure of the @xmath2-th signal proportionally to @xmath7 and the exposure of the @xmath3-th signal proportionally to @xmath8 .",
    "for instance , if both signals are positive , then an increase in cross - correlation reduces exposure though the cross - correcting term .",
    "as the cross - correction for the @xmath2-th asset is directly proportional to a linear combination of the @xmath3-th asset past returns , we refer to it as a lead - lag term @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : general ] , we introduce the standard mathematical tools to solve the portfolio allocation problem . in sec .",
    "[ sec : two ] , we study in detail the two - asset portfolio problem while sec .",
    "[ sec : factor ] extends to the case of multiple assets with identical correlations ( e.g. , a sector of the market ) .",
    "we quantify the improvement in terms of the expected sharpe ratio ( or risk - adjusted return ) of the portfolio and the sharpe gain compared to a static allocation scheme .",
    "conclusion section summarizes the main results , while technical derivations are reported in appendices .",
    "we first introduce a mathematical market model for @xmath0 assets and describe linear trend following strategies .",
    "we then present the dynamic portfolio allocation based on a linear combination of strategy signals . in this frame , we derive mean and variance of portfolio returns , formulate the optimal allocation problem , and show its reduction to a standard static allocation problem for @xmath1 virtual assets .",
    "we assume that the return @xmath9 of the @xmath3-th asset at time @xmath10 has two contributions : an instantaneous fluctuation ( noise ) @xmath11 , and a stochastic trend which in general is given as a linear combination of random fluctuations @xmath12 , @xmath13 where the matrix @xmath14 describes the stochastic trend of the @xmath3-th asset , while @xmath15 and @xmath16 are two sets of independent gaussian variables with mean zero and the following covariance structure : @xmath17 where @xmath18 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 otherwise . here",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the covariance matrices that describe inter - asset correlations of noises @xmath11 and of stochastic trend components @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "this yields the covariance matrix of gaussian asset returns to be @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the matrix transposition . for each asset ,",
    "the stochastic trend induces auto - correlations due to a linear combination of exogenous random variables @xmath23 which are independent from short - time noises @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , the structure of these _ auto - correlations _ ( which is described by the matrix @xmath14 ) is considered to be independent from _ inter - asset correlations _ ( which are described by matrices @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) . in particular , the covariance matrices @xmath21 and @xmath22 do not depend on time . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the presence of auto - correlations makes tf strategies profitable even for assets with zero mean returns . in other words ,",
    "we consider asset auto - correlations as the origin of profitability of tf strategies .",
    "although the whole analysis can be performed for nonzero mean returns , it is convenient to impose @xmath26 in order to accentuate the gain of the tf strategy over a simple buy - and - hold strategy ( which is profitless in this case ) .      the incremental profit - and - loss of a tf portfolio ( i.e. , the total return of the portfolio at time @xmath10 ) is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the position of the tf strategy on the @xmath3-th asset at time @xmath29 . in a conventional setting ,",
    "the position @xmath28 is determined from earlier returns @xmath30 , ... , @xmath31 of the @xmath3-th asset . in this paper",
    ", we will show that this conventional choice is suboptimal due to inter - asset corrections . to overcome this limitation",
    ", we introduce the position @xmath28 as a weighted linear combination of the signals from all assets : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the signal from the @xmath34-th asset , with weights @xmath35 to be determined .",
    "note that the weights are considered to be time - independent , in coherence with the earlier assumption of time - independent inter - asset correlations .",
    "the incremental p&l of the portfolio becomes @xmath36 where @xmath35 can be interpreted as the weight of the @xmath34-th signal onto the position of @xmath3-th asset .",
    "the particular case of diagonal weights ( when @xmath37 for @xmath38 ) corresponds to a portfolio of @xmath0 tf strategies with weights @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , the standard portfolio allocation problem is included in our framework , in which the diagonal weight @xmath39 represents the amount of capital allocated to the @xmath3-th asset . in general ,",
    "non - diagonal terms allow one to benefit from inter - asset correlations to enhance the profitability of the tf portfolio .",
    "following @xcite , we consider a tf strategy whose signal is determined by a _ linear",
    "_ combination of earlier returns ( e.g. , an exponential moving average , see below ) : @xmath40 so that @xmath41 with given matrices @xmath42 .    using the gaussian character of the model , we compute in [ sec : mean_var ] the mean and variance of this incremental profit - and - loss of a portfolio with @xmath0 assets : @xmath43 where @xmath44 the structural separation between auto - correlations and inter - asset corrections from eq .",
    "( [ eq : c ] ) is also reflected in these formulas .",
    "once the mean and variance of the incremental p&l are derived in the form ( [ eq : mean_var ] ) , the dynamic allocation problem for a portfolio of trend following strategies is reduced to the standard optimization problem for a portfolio composed of @xmath1 `` virtual '' assets ( indexed by a double index @xmath45 ) whose means are @xmath46 and the covariance is @xmath47 .",
    "one can therefore search for the weights @xmath35 that optimize the chosen criterion ( e.g. , to minimize variance under a fixed expected return for the markowitz theory ) . in this work ,",

    "what follows , we consider the symmetric weights so that there remain @xmath57 unknown weights , with the same number of equations . for instance",
    ", one needs to solve @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 equations for a portfolio with two , three and four assets , respectively .",
    "note also that any solution of the above optimization problem is defined up to a multiplicative factor . in fact , the squared sharpe ratio in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sharpe ] ) is invariant under multiplication of weights @xmath35 by any nonzero constant . as a consequence",

    "( [ eq : optim_equations ] ) depends on two covariance matrices @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( inter - asset correlations ) , matrices @xmath14 ( asset auto - correlations ) , and matrices @xmath61 ( signals of tf strategies ) .",
    "once all these matrices are specified , the optimization problem can be solved numerically .",
    "however , it is impossible in practice to infer such a large number of parameters from market data , as well as to understand their influences on the optimal weights .",
