    "ever since it was shown , that almost all galaxies have a central super - massive black hole ( kormendy & richstone 1995 , faber et al . 1997 ) , it has become of renewed interest to understand the life - cycle of black holes .",
    "is it driven by accretion from an accretion disk ( shakura 1972 , shakura & sunyaev 1973 , novikov & thorne 1973 ) , mergers with other black holes ( hughes & blandford 2003 ) , an alternating sequence of the two ( berti & volonteri 2008 ) , eating stars whole , spin - down driving a relativistic jet , or some other not yet understood process ?",
    "early statistics have already showed that existing black holes are active in the sense to have an accretion disk shine prominently only a small fraction of the time , of order one percent or so .    on the other hand , digging deep with observations in the radio regime shows that even very quiet black holes are all active in the sense of showing compact radio emission . very long baseline ( usually intercontinental )",
    "radio interferometry ( vlbi ) shows that in all cases , when the data are sufficiently deep , the activity is driving a relativistic jet ( chini et al .",
    "1989 * * , * * nagar et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 , 2002 , 2005 , falcke et al .",
    "this emission is strong , when the jet happens to point in our direction , and so is strongly enhanced by relativistic boosting . and",
    "yet , the power is far sub - eddington in many such cases .",
    "therefore it is hard to accept that accretion could provide the power . for jets pointing elsewhere these cases",
    "populate the low end of the radio luminosity function ( windhorst et al .",
    "1984 , 1985 , 1990 , perez - fournon & biermann 1984 ) . in such cases",
    "spin - down almost certainly powers the activity ( blandford 1976 ) .",
    "there are several proposals on the ways of interpreting the compact radio emission , some with emission from the disk itself , and some with emission from a relativistic jet .",
    "since we can directly observe a relativistic jet in some cases , we follow occam s razor , and adopt the point of view , that all such cases have the same mechanism .",
    "therefore we interpret the compact radio emission as arising from a relativistic jet in all cases ( falcke , malkan & biermann 1995 ; falcke & biermann 1995 ; falcke 1996 ; falcke & biermann 1996 ; falcke & biermann 1999 ; markoff , falcke & fender 2001 ; yuan , markoff & falcke 2002a ; yuan et al .",

    "it had been noted early on , that the low radio frequency spectrum suggested a low energy cutoff in the electron energy distribution , such as would naturally occur from the decay of charged pions , created in hadronic collisions ( falcke et al .",
    "1995a , 1995b , 1996 , * *  * * gopal - krishna et al .",
    "the site to do this would be the inner accretion disks in a low accretion mode , when the disk turns into a very hot advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) . for a dimensionless spin - parameter @xmath1 the temperature reaches to relativistic levels ( mahadevan 1998 ) , and the thermal collisions become hadronic , giving rise to pion production . as a consequence such radio spectra suggest that the spin is high .",
    "however , in the case , that the jets start purely electrodynamically , as poynting flux jets , the charged pion production would be in the shocks around stars or compact clouds entering the jets sideways ( e.g. , gamma rays from cloud penetration at the base of agn jets , araudo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) ) .",
    "as almost all otherwise quiescent super - massive black holes are active in such a sense , it implies that they maintain their spin at a high level , compatible with the suggestion of blandford ( 1976 ) , that the decay time of the black hole magnetic fields is very long ; this is feasible as long as the power output used to drive the jet is a small fraction of the energy reservoir , the rotation of the black hole .",
    "the power output estimated by whysong & antonucci ( 2003 ) for the radio galaxies m87 (= ngc4486 = vir a ) and ngc5128 ( = cen a ) suggests that indeed the power output by the jets is of order @xmath2 of the limiting eddington luminosity , or even less , allowing a long life time .",
    "this limit implies that no matter is supplied from the disk to the jet at all , which means that the jet starts as a poynting flux dominated jet ( sikora et al .",
    "armitage & natarajan ( 1999 ) confirmed that a fully rotating black hole can power a poynting flux dominated jet for the very long lifetime of agns .",
    "thus it is of tantamount importance to understand , which process allows the super - massive black holes to attain such a high spin state .    due to accretion ,",
    "black holes spin up to the maximal spin limit , even in the absence of initial rotation ( bardeen 1970 ) .",
    "for the maximally spinning ( extreme ) kerr black holes the efficiency of accreted rest mass conversion into outgoing electromagnetic radiation is @xmath3 .",
    "a refined accretion model , assuming a geometrically thin , but optically thick steady state accretion disk ( composed of rotating plasma with high opacity ) was introduced by shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) and novikov & thorne ( 1973 ) .",
    "this model takes into account the additional effect of the photons emitted from the disk and captured by the black hole , modifying both the energy and angular momentum transport from the disk into the black hole ( page & thorne 1974 )",
    ". therefore the spin evolution and mass growth of black holes is slightly changed as compared to bardeen s model .",
    "the spin limit is reduced to @xmath4 ( compared to @xmath5 in the bardeen approach ) for an electron scattering atmosphere ; also the conversion efficiency diminishes to @xmath6 ( thorne 1974 ) .",
    "the black holes with radiating accretion disks leading to photon capture are referred to as _ canonical black holes _ , while the accretion disk is discussed in the framework of a _ hydrodynamic _ model with _ steady - state accretion_.    in _ magnetohydrodynamic _ ( mhd ) models , magnetic stresses in the disk modify the dynamics of the accretion disk .",
    "the study of mhd accretion flows for various magnetosphere models lead to a modified energy and angular momentum transport ( camenzind 1986 , 1987 , takahashi et al .",
    "1990 , nitta , takahashi & tomimatsu 1991 , hirotani et al .",
    "blandford & znajek ( 1977 ) have found a mechanism ( bz ) of extracting both energy and angular momentum from the rotating black hole via open poloidal magnetic field lines emanating from its event horizon ( such that the total magnetic flux over the horizon vanishes ) . in another configuration of",
    "closed poloidal magnetic field lines , also emanating from the event horizon , but anchored in the disk , the energy and angular momentum are exchanged between the rapidly rotating black hole and the slowly rotating disk ( li 2000 , wang , xiao & lei 2002 ) .",
    "the bz mechanism is nowadays regarded as a possible source of powering jets in agn s and gamma - rray bursts ( grb s ) , where the angular momentum is carried away by outflowing jets .",
    "jets existing in symbiosis with accretion disks and black holes represent an efficient mechanism for extracting energy and angular momentum from the disk and black hole . based on blandford & knigl ( 1979 ) arguments , falcke & biermann ( 1996 ) developed a simple model where the plasma jet emanating from the inner region of the disk forms a _ symbiotic _ system with the disk and the black hole .",
    "this model , in conjunction with the bz mechanism describes the rest mass , angular momentum and energy transport between the black hole and its environment in the presence of magnetic field and jets .",
    "focusing on the role of jets ( by switching off the magnetic field ) this symbiotic model was discussed in detail by donea & biermann ( 1996 ) . an alternative model for launching relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) from an accreting kerr black hole by converting the accretion disc energy into jet energy ,",
    "was recently advanced by duan ( 2010 ) .",
    "_ composite _ models of accretion disks involve a radial transition between a shakura - sunyaev disk on the outside to an adaf on the inside . in an adaf the heat generated via viscosity is advected inward rather than radiated away .",
    "some composite models apply a geometrically thick and optically thin hot corona ( mannheim et al .",
    "1995 ) positioned between the marginally stable orbit and the inner edge of the geometrically thin and optically thick accretion disk , lying at a few gravitational radii ( thorne & price 1975 , shapiro , lightman & eardley 1976 ) . in composite models",
    "the soft and hard components of the broad band x - ray spectra of galactic black holes were attributed to the thermal radiation of the accretion disk and the emission mechanism in the corona , respectively . in another type of composite models",
    "the corona lies above and under the accretion disk and the soft photons arriving from the disk produce a hard emission via their inverse comptonization by the thermally hot electrons in the corona ( liang & price 1977 ) . in both configurations the soft photon flux of the disk and , in turn , the photon capture effect on the mass - energy growth of the black hole are reduced",
    ". the spin evolution and its limiting value are therefore closer to the predictions of bardeen than for canonical black holes .",
    "we picture the evolution of an activity event of a black hole as follows .",
    "two galaxies interact and feed low angular momentum material into the centers ( toomre & toomre 1972 ) . in case",
    "both have a central black hole , these black holes merge , and typically produce a merged black hole with relatively high spin , of order @xmath7 ( berti & volonteri 2008 ) .",
    "then accretion near maximum levels pushes up the spin to near maximum ( bardeen 1970 ) , and establishes a maximal magnetic field , and a jet , initially weak .",
    "when accretion slows down , the jet becomes strong , and the emission from the inner disk dies away . in the following long phase the black hole powers the jet from its rotational energy alone . in the present work we study _ the evolution of the spin and mass _ of the black hole coexisting in _ a symbiotic system with a radiatively truncated accretion disk , a pair of jets , and a magnetosphere _ containing both open and closed field line regions . as no matter is supplied from the disk to the poynting flux dominated jet , its effect appears only in the suppression of the radiation from the accretion disk in its innermost region . for simplicity",
    ", we do not include possible contributions of hard photons radiated away by a hot corona , neither the adaf mechanism .",
    "an ionization instability may also influence the lifetime cycle and overall complexity in the supermassive black hole environment ( janiuk & czerny 2011 ) . despite the simplifications , we present the most complete symbiotic model up to date , and we employ it for the study of spin and mass evolution .    in section 2 we briefly review the elements of the symbiotic model . in section 3",
    "we discuss the structure equations of the disk , as derived from conservation laws and give a detailed presentation on the effects of the magnetic fields with coexisting open and closed field line topologies .",
    "we also discuss the effects on the radial profiles of the flux emitted by the disk and write up a generic flux formula .",

    "the topology of the black hole magnetosphere consists of open and closed flux lines .",
    "open flux lines emanate from the event horizon or the disk and extend to infinity forming a jet , whereas closed ones connect the horizon and the accretion disk ( macdonald & thorne 1982 ) .",
    "open field lines also could emanate from the outer disk region , outside the maximal extension of the closed line region ( uzdensky 2005 ) .",

    "our approximation constitutes a subset of their configurations , and one of their results is that the configuration connecting black hole and disk is more important for thin disks and does not transfer significant amounts of angular momentum .",
    "however , since we argue for a radiative inner edge of the accretion disk to be possibly far outside the inner - most stable orbit , a direct comparison is difficult .",
    "the open field line topology emanating from the horizon provides the basic idea for the blandford - znajek ( bz ) mechanism , which describes how rotational energy and angular momentum can be extracted electromagnetically from the spinning hole and transported to large distances in the form of a poynting flux jet ( blandford & znajek , znajek 1977 , hirose et al .",

    "we assume the maximally efficient bz mechanism , which implies that at the event horizon @xmath86 .    the magnetic field at the horizon",
    "is given by the history of accretion to the black hole ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) .",

    "( [ b2h ] ) to hold in our model .",
    "this approximation was also found in considerations by krolik ( 1999 ) to be generally valid .",
    "in addition to the parameters @xmath88 and @xmath85 of the open magnetic field , we introduce the opening angle @xmath89 of the cone separating open and closed field lines in each hemisphere .",
    "the open magnetic field lines emanate from the horizon for @xmath90 , whereas the closed ones connect the horizon to the disk between @xmath89 and the equatorial plane . the maximal extension of the closed magnetic field on the disk is at @xmath91 , outside which another open field line system begins .",
    "we sketch this configuration on fig .",
    "[ bhm ] .        for the closed magnetic field , wang , xiao & lei ( 2002 ) employed the power law distribution @xmath92 , @xmath93 given by blandford ( 1976 ) and defined the poloidal component @xmath94 on the disk as @xmath95they assumed that the pressures due to the magnetic field and infalling matter are in balance at the inner edge of the disk ( @xmath46 ) and the ratio @xmath96 varies from @xmath97 to @xmath98 for @xmath99 .",
    "as the closed field lines connect the event horizon to the accretion disk , the rotating black hole exerts a magnetic torque on the disk , provided the flux lines are frozen into the plasma ( ideal mhd condition ) . this torque transfers angular momentum and energy from the black hole to the disk ( @xmath100 is assumed ) , modifying the global energy and angular momentum balance ( li 2000 , 2003 ) .    in the mhd simulations of hirose",
    "et al . ( 2004 ) these magnetic field configurations were found to be uncommon , connecting the black hole horizon to the disk .",
    "however , since we include a radiative cutoff of the inner disk , inspired by observations , our configuration is not readily compared to theirs . also , we have the additional free parameter of a maximum latitude @xmath101 of magnetic field lines connecting , which allows the black hole to be stronger or weaker in its effect on the jet than given by the current accretion rate as considered in hirose et al . ( 2004 ) .",
    "simulations of such configurations would be very useful , when the black hole has acquired already its maximal magnetic field , and then the accretion rate dips below its earlier rate ; then the newly accreted field is weaker , and the separatrix between disk connection and jet configuration could be different , resulting in a different @xmath89 .    by solving numerically the grad - shafranov ( gs ) equation , uzdensky ( 2005 )",
    "studied the topology of a stationary axisymmetric force - free degenerate magnetosphere of a kerr black hole with closed field lines between the event horizon and a thin , keplerian , infinitely conducting accretion disk .",

    "this is a modified counterpart of the blandford power law given by eq .",
    "( [ bdbh ] ) , with qualitative agreement for the power @xmath104 ( modulo a scaling factor ) .",
    "the uzdensky ( 2005 ) solution of the gs equation determines the radial extension of the field lines anchored in the disk as a function of the spin . in the limit of slow rotation",
    "the size of the magnetically connected inner part of the disk decreases with the increasing black hole spin .",
    "we stress here that the model we adapt ( based on the blandford power law ) also predicts this shrinking of the closed magnetic field region with increasing spin , as illustrated on fig .",
    "[ r_max ] .",
    "uzdensky did not include any magnetic field lines running from the black hole to infinity , and so in our language his @xmath105 .",
    "our model includes the jet , and hence the open magnetic field lines emanating from the horizon , thus @xmath89 is a free parameter .",
    "uzdensky solves a different problem , the one for a jet - less black hole , and so it is not immediately obvious how to directly use his results for the more general setup we discuss .",
    "therefore the application of the blandford power law for the ratio @xmath106 seems to us to be the most straightforward way to compare the effect of the truncation of the radiation on the spin evolution with previous results .",
    "numerical simulations of rotating black holes with a magnetosphere and a thin accretion disk produced realistic jet profiles which have a complicated double layer structure with an inner gas pressure - driven and an outer magnetically driven jet ( mizuno et al .",
    "2006 ) . for the magnetically driven jets",
    "the open field lines may be connected to the disk , without touching the event horizon .",
    "these magnetohydrodynamic mechanisms dissipate energy and pump angular momentum from the disk into the jet .",
    "the black hole spin evolution is driven by spin - down to drive the jet and independently by spin - up by accretion from the disk .    with a non - zero @xmath107-velocity component @xmath108 , the plasma forms a jet extracting rest mass , angular momentum and energy from the disk .",
    "the loss of matter by the jets is specified by the parameter@xmath109where @xmath110 ( vanishing in our model ) and @xmath111 is the rate of the rest mass flow into the jet ( falcke & biermann 1995 ) . as the geometry is reflection symmetric with respect to the equatorial plane , @xmath112",
    "is composed of two equal contributions , of the upstream and downstream jets .",
    "the balance equations for mass , angular momentum and energy in the presence of the jets were derived in donea & biermann ( 1996 ) , with parameters @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( the cut - off radius of the radiating disk ) describing the global properties of the jet .",
    "we adopt the simplified approach as in falcke & biermann ( 1995 ) .",
    "the differential rotation of the orbiting plasma winds up the radial magnetic field lines acting as a dynamo which generates a poloidal magnetic field .",
    "the latter produces a vertical poynting flux jet , containing negligible baryonic matter .",
    "the jet being in a poynting flux limit implies @xmath115 .",
    "this assumption decouples the energy and angular momentum transport in the jet from the accretion disk properties .",
    "almost all supermassive black holes show signs of relativistic jets ( perez - fournon & biermann 1984 , chini et al .",

    "2000 , 2001 , 2002 , 2005 ) , exhibiting compact radio emission and extreme variability in this emission ( the explanation of this variability needing relativistic motion ) .",
    "the jet activity is correlated with the high spin .",
    "should this really be true for the vast majority of otherwise quiescent black holes , this would be consistent with the hypothesis , that these black holes are in a high spin state .",
    "theoretical estimates are consistent with assuming that the intrinsic poynting flux of a black hole in a high spin state is of order of @xmath2 of the eddington luminosity ( armitage & natarian 1999 ) , also consistent with the data on some nearby radio galaxies , cyg a , m87 and cen a ( whysong & antonucci 2003 ) .",
    "this low value implies that the lifetime of activity in this state is about the hubble time . in other worlds",
    "the spin - down due to the jet is inefficient , the jet driving can be maintained for extremely long times , independently of any accretion .",
    "this low backreaction is the main reason we will not include the jet contribution in the balance equations .",
    "there is observational evidence from the source grs1915 + 105 ( fender et al .",
    "2003 , eikenberry 1998 ) that the innermost region of the disk does not radiate when the jet is strong .",
    "we will therefore assume that unless in the exterior luminous part of the disk , where energy is dissipated , below a certain radius @xmath114 the disk does not radiate .",
    "thus all energy and angular momentum from this region is transported into the black hole , hence powering up the jet .",
    "the jet is not connected to the disk directly , but only to the black hole , allowing it to start as a pure poynting flux .",
    "baryonic matter is added into the jet only later , far up from the black hole by intersecting clouds , stars , stellar winds and from shear and boundary instabilities ( araudo et al .",
    "this model allows the early lorentz factor of the jet flow to be very high , as recently suggested by various observations ( see e.g. ghisellini & tavecchio 2008 ) .    in abramowicz",
    "et al . ( 1978 ) the equipotential surfaces in the absence of magnetic fields were employed to derive the thickness of the disk near the inner edge .",
    "it was shown that a non - radiating disk can no longer be described as geometrically thin , its pressure becomes important for the radial disk structure , and the inner edge is pushed in the region between the marginally stable and the marginally bound circular orbits .",
    "for schwarzschild black hole the marginally stable orbit is at @xmath116 , while the innermost bound circular orbit is at @xmath117 . with increasing black hole spin the marginally stable orbit approaches the horizon , the marginally bound orbit being trapped in between , their difference becoming very small .",
    "we also argue that all angular momentum of the accretion disk goes into the black hole from the interior zone , independent of whether the disk is thick or thin , either by direct accretion or via the torques of the closed magnetic field lines and the details of this transfer do not matter in a quasi - stationary situation . in particular , the exact location of the exact inner edge of the disk ( below @xmath114 ) does not influence the angular momentum transport towards the black hole ; all goes in .",

    "these spin limits are given in table r_jet_theta_max .",
    "for @xmath251 and @xmath120 they tend to be identical , indicating that the photon capture from the regions closer to the horizon is more important . with increasing @xmath89 we strengthen the effects due to the bz process and decrease the spin limits , also indicated by the numbers of table [ theta_max ] .",
    "for wider solid angle of the open field lines the mass evolution are steeper .",
    "nonetheless , the mass evolution curves with increasing @xmath252 are approaching the evolution profile of the canonical black hole because the increase of the radiative truncation radius compensates the effect of the bz mechanism . for higher",
    "radii @xmath114 the mass evolution curves are also steeper .",
    "the efficiency @xmath253 shown in table [ r_jet_theta_max ] is slightly decreasing for higher values of @xmath89 as more and more rotational energy is extracted by the bz process .",
    "the trends characterizing the pure symbiotic model are also present where the increasing radiative truncation radius causes in the value of @xmath253 a mild increase .",
    "thus in symbiotic models combined with black hole magnetosphere we can produce conversion efficiencies higher than those obtained for the canonical black holes if the angle @xmath89 is small enough . for greater boundary angles , such as @xmath254 ,",
    "the canonical black holes are still more efficient in the mass - to - radiation conversion mechanism .",
    "the truncation effect here is not so important , though @xmath253 can be increased somewhat by applying greater values for @xmath114 .",
    "in this paper we explored a black hole - accretion disk - magnetosphere - jet symbiotic model , consistent with the observations on the accretion disk and on jet .",
    "the thin , steady - state accretion disk feeds the black hole in both angular momentum and mass .",
    "observations of the source grs1915 + 105 indicate that the innermost region of the disk does not radiate when the jet is powerful .",
    "( the initial lorentz factors of jet flows can be very large , of order @xmath255 . )",
    "hence we assume no radiation below a certain radius , as opposed to the exterior luminous part of the disk .",
    "the surplus of energy and angular momentum transported via accretion into the black hole can be regarded as a source of the strong jet .",
    "the jet is driven purely electromagnetically by the black hole rotation .",
    "we assumed that the jet starts as a poynting flux , carrying no baryonic matter , which is added into the jet only far up from the black hole by intersecting clouds , stars , stellar winds and from shear and boundary instabilities .",
    "thus , there is no direct connection between the disk and jet in this model , in agreement with observations on the long lifetime of jets . due to the extremely long lifetime of a relativistic jet and its related inefficient spin - down",
    ", we could neglect the backreaction of the jet onto the black hole .",
    "the magnetosphere consists of an open magnetic field region with field lines emanating from the polar regions of the black hole , exhibiting the blandford - znajek mechanism , responsible for powering the jets in agn s and grb s ; a closed magnetic field region with field lines emanating from the horizon under a polar angle @xmath256 and anchored to the disk , thus exerting a torque on it ; and finally an exterior open magnetic field line configuration , extending from @xmath257 ( the radius where the closed field lines emanating at @xmath89 are anchored ) , with no direct coupling to the black hole .    under these assumptions",
    "we have studied the spin evolution of the black hole in its symbiosis with the accretion disk , jet and the black hole magnetosphere .",
    "the topology of the magnetic field has by far the most prominent role : it drastically modifies the number of the captured photons and in turn the spin evolution of the black hole . while for open field line topology the limiting values of the spin parameter and the conversion efficiency",
    "are slightly decreased as compared to the values derived for canonical black holes , the inclusion of the closed magnetic field configuration lowers the spin limit considerably , from @xmath258 to @xmath259 .",
    "this happens in spite of the size of the closed magnetic field shrinking with increasing spin .",
    "thus the topological properties of the magnetic field strongly correlate with the spin limit .    therefore , assuming that observations suggest that spins larger than 0.95 are common we confirm hirose et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and mckinney ( 2005 ) that the magnetic field configuration strongly connecting black hole and disk should be uncommon .",
    "therefore observations on black hole spins could favour or disfavour the existence ( or the coupling to the disk ) of the closed magnetic field line region .",
    "in particular , a high black hole spin , as would be inferred from the low energy cutoff of the electron energy distribution in the low radio frequency spectrum of the jet indirectly forbids the existence of such a closed magnetic field .    as for the jet contribution",
    ", we find that narrow opening angles led to larger spin limits , than for canonical black holes .",
    "the radiative truncation of the disk suggested by the presence of the jet further increases the spin limit .",
    "we conclude that collimated jets slightly increase both the spins and the efficiency .",
