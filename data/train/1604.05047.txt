    "this paper is about denotational semantics of ( a fragment of ) linear logic .",
    "the focus is on ( denotational ) static and dynamic semantics , i.e. respectively _ semantics of proofs _ and _ semantics of proofs and their cut - elimination_. denotational semantics were introduced by scott @xcite as mathematical models for programming languages . through the proofs - as - programs correspondence , it is equivalent to study semantics of programs and semantics of proofs , and the current paper will focus on a fragment of linear logic .",
    "denotational semantics are data - driven semantics , i.e. their focus is on data and data types .",
    "a program then corresponds to a function that maps some input data to some output data .",
    "this view of _ programs as functions _",
    "is however arguably too coarse , as it models only the _ what _ ( a program computes ) and not the _ how _ ( the program computes ) .",
    "consider a program @xmath0 and an input data @xmath1 , and the result @xmath2 that @xmath0 outputs when given @xmath1 as input .",
    "denotational semantics will represent both @xmath3  @xmath0 given input @xmath1  and @xmath2  the result of @xmath0 s computation given input @xmath1  by the same object , i.e. @xmath4 .",
    "dynamic semantics try to provide mathematical models that capture also _ how _ programs compute .",
    "formally a dynamic semantic will be such that @xmath5 , but will provide an interpretation to the computation as well , i.e. there exists an operation @xmath6 in the model such that @xmath7 .",
    "this paper presents a functor mapping the interpretations of multiplicative linear logic ( ) proofs in dynamic semantics to the interpretations of proofs in denotational semantics .",
    "intuitively , one can understand this functor as taking a dynamic semantics and collapsing the interpretation of execution to an equality .",
    "more precisely , we show how this collapse can be performed in a way that preserves _ quantitative information_. formally , the functor is defined as the antisymmetric tensor algebra construction .",
    "since the paper is concerned with semantics of a fragment of linear logic , we will now speak of proofs rather than programs and of cut - elimination rather than program execution .",
    "however , the reader should make a note to herself that , through the curry - howard correspondence , proof - theoretic and computer science terminologies are interchangeable .",
    "[ [ static - semantics . ] ] static semantics .",
    "static semantics are denotational models that _ do not account for _ the dynamics , i.e.  the interpretation of a proof in a static model should be an invariant of the cut - elimination .",
    "a well - studied static semantics for linear logic is the so - called _ relational model _ where formulas @xmath8 are interpreted as sets @xmath9 and proofs of the linear implication @xmath10 are interpreted as binary relations on @xmath11 .",
    "another example of static semantics considered in this paper is girard s coherence spaces , which can be defined categorically as a tight double - glueing construction @xcite applied to the relational model .",
    "_ quantitative _ denotational semantics are those which capture quantifiable properties of the programs it represents , such as time , space , and resource consumption .",
    "that is , quantitative semantics are denotational models of computation that mirror more information than the so - called _ qualitative _ models , e.g. the relational model , coherence spaces .",
    "origins of this approach can be traced back to girard s work on functor models for lambda - calculus @xcite  that inspired linear logic @xcite  which exhibited for the first time a decomposition of the semantic interpretation of lambda - terms as taylor series .",
    "quantitative semantics has also provided static semantics for various algebraic extensions of lambda calculus such as probabilistic lambda calculi @xcite . by considering a refinement of the relational model , laird _",
    "@xcite provided a uniform account of several static models accounting for quantitative notions .",
    "finally , some quantitative generalisations of coherence space semantics have been considered , namely probabilistic @xcite and quantum coherence spaces @xcite . however , no uniform account of those has yet appeared in the literature .",
    "[ [ dynamic - semantics . ] ] dynamic semantics .",
    "we regroup under this terminology those semantics that do not solely account for proofs but also for their _ dynamics _ , e.g. game semantics and various _ geometry of interaction _ ( goi ) constructions . formally",
    ", the interpretation of a proof of @xmath10 cut with a proof of @xmath1 will differ from the interpretation of the cut - free proof of @xmath2 obtained by cut - elimination .",
    "although different models and techniques regrouped under this name may differ on certain aspects , their interpretation of programs / proofs is quite similar @xcite . on the technical level",
    ", we will work in this paper with the author s _ interaction graphs _ construction .",
    "these models include all of girard s geometry of interaction ( goi ) models @xcite , and provide a far - reaching generalisation of those .",
    "indeed , interaction graphs should be understood as a quantitative variant of geometry of interaction . moreover , since goi models are strongly related to game semantics ( even more so when we restrict to as it done in this paper ) , interaction graphs can be thought of as a quantitative generalisation of those as well .",
    "interaction graphs thus provide a natural framework to deal with quantitative dynamic interpretations with great generality .",
    "one should note that goi models differ from those of game semantics by how the formulas are interpreted .",
    "game semantics start with interpretations of formulas ( games ) and then define the interpretations of proofs . on the contrary , and though proof interpretations are the same , goi constructions define the interpretation of formulas from the `` untyped '' interpretation of proofs",
    ". categorically , the latter construction is realised by a ( tight ) double - glueing construction @xcite defined from a notion of orthogonality between morphisms .    [",

    "the first contribution of this paper is the definition of the categorical foundations of the interaction graphs constructions through the introduction of _",
    "triskells_. this categorical apparatus is of interest in itself as it generalises both the bicategory of spans and the categories of matrices and arrays over a semiring .",
    "furthermore , unlike in the work of laird _ et al .",
    "_ , our definition is performed internally to the underlying category and does not refer to external objects .",
    "this opens the way to defining even wider generalisations based on the replacement of the underlying category of sets with e.g. any topos .    secondly , we shed light onto a new relationship between dynamic and denotational semantics .",
    "this relationship is not only shown to hold for _ qualitative semantics _ , but also for _ quantitative semantics_. this provides formal grounds to the claim that the author s interaction graphs construction should be understood as a quantitative version of dynamic semantics ",
    "goi and game semantics .",
    "though not the first work bridging dynamic and static semantics @xcite , the technique used here is novel and is the first to be applied to quantitative models .    finally , we describe how this functor not only preserves the interpretation of proofs but also maps _",
    "orthogonalities_. i.e.  we show how this functor lifts to a map from the double - glueing constructions considered in interaction graphs and the double - glueing construction of coherence spaces .",
    "in particular , the specific model detailed in the first paper by the author @xcite is shown to map to `` strict '' probabilistic coherence spaces .",
    "this correspondence , although confined to specific cases when considering categories of relations , can be lifted to a much more general correspondence when considering the generalisation of weighted relations provided by triskells .",
    "we end the paper by sketching a very general construction of _ quantitative coherence spaces _ suggested by the previous sections .",

    "the first section introduces the notion of _ triskell _ in a category .",
    "triskells are generalisations of spans that will account for the quantitative aspects available in the interaction graphs constructions .",
    "the category of triskells will then ( section ) be shown to have the structure of a _ traced monoidal category _ , i.e.  it has the structure to define a goi interpretation of proofs .",
    "we also show how triskells can be mapped to weighted relations in the sense of laird _ et al .",
    "these two results show that the category of triskells can accomodate both quantitative goi and quantitative static semantics .",
    "the monoidal products interpreting the linear logic tensor in these two kinds of models are not the same however .",
    "we thus introduce ( ) an endofunctor which maps one monoidal product to the other .",
    "this functor thus maps the interpretation of a proof of in ( quantitative ) dynamic models to the interpretation of the same proof in ( quantitative ) denotational models .",
    "finally , we study in the double - glueing construction of goi and show that it relates to the coherence space double - glueing through the functor just exhibited .",
    "this result is however quite specific as it is based upon the notion of determinant and trace of matrices .",
    "we thus end this paper by defining a notion of determinant and trace of triskells , allowing for the definition of both quantitative goi models and quantitative coherence space semantics in a very general setting    [ [ acknowledgements . ] ] acknowledgements .",

    "for this , we define a congruence on the set of triskells over @xmath191 as follows : two triskells @xmath12 and @xmath73 are equivalent if and only if there exists two `` zero triskells '' @xmath192 and @xmath193 and a triskell @xmath194 such that @xmath195 and @xmath196 . here",

    "notice moreover that this congruence is contained into the equivalence defined from the contracting functor @xmath121 , i.e. the equivalence defined by @xmath204 if and only if @xmath205 .",
    "this implies that the functor @xmath121 is well - defined on the quotient category @xmath203 , as two equivalent triskells in @xmath126 have the same image through @xmath121 .",
    "lastly , one easily checks that this quotient is compatible with the monoidal structure , i.e. @xmath206 is a monoidal category .",

    "a consequence of is the fact that a proof s interpretation in the dynamic models is mapped , through @xmath170 , to the interpretation of the same proof in the relational model , modulo the fact that we are working with a continuous semiring ( or a ring when considering only finite sets as objects ) .",
    "more importantly , this last theorem [ fock_trik_monoidal ] extends this result when one considers triskells instead relations .",
    "i.e. a proof s interpretation in the interaction graphs model for a monoid @xmath18 is mapped through @xmath175 to the interpretation of the same proof in the triskells denotational model for the monoid @xmath209 ( modulo the simple quotient considered above ) .",
    "we will now show how this result actually extends to the double - glueing constructions .",
    "in this section , we start discussing the image of the double - glueing construction considered in interaction graphs .",
    "first , we limit our discussion to the subcategory of @xmath210 where all objects are finite sets .",
    "a further restriction will be that @xmath18 is chosen as a subring of the complex numbers @xmath211 .",
    "these constraints are quite strong but they were introduced by the author @xcite to obtain a combinatorial version of girard s hyperfinite geometry of interaction @xcite .    in this particular case , we can define in the category of relations both the ( normalised ) trace  i.e.  the mean of diagonal coefficients  and the determinant of matrices .",

    "this second restriction implies that the operations interpreting multiplicative linear logic will not create weights greater than @xmath162 @xcite , i.e. the fact that @xmath213 $ ] is not a subring ( i.e. not closed under addition ) will not induce incoherences in the model.$ ] .",
    "this is clear for the disjoint union used to interpret the tensor product , it is proved for the trace in earlier works @xcite . ]",
    "these restrictions still provide an adequate framework for defining the combinatorial variant of girard s hyperfinite model @xcite and probabilistic coherent spaces .",
    "girard s hyperfinite goi uses the fuglede - kadison determinant @xmath214 @xcite , a ( positive-)real - valued determinant which corresponds , in finite dimensions , to the absolute value of the usual determinant ( to the power @xmath215 ) .",
    "this determinant is used to define the orthogonality considered in girard s goi models , i.e. two matrices @xmath8 are ( det-)orthogonal , noted @xmath216 , when @xmath217 , i.e.  when @xmath218 .",
    "the trace , on the other hand , can be used to define ( a variant of ) the orthogonality considered in probabilistic / quantum coherence spaces , i.e. two matrices @xmath8 are ( trace-)orthogonal , denoted @xmath219 , when @xmath2200,1[$ ] . and",
    "@xmath162 which are here forbidden .",
    "this slight change however do not impact the result , i.e. we still define from this orthogonality a model of multiplicative linear logic . ]",

    "this result , while interesting on its own , can be generalised if one works with triskells instead of relations .",
    "the reason triskells provide a better framework is that we will be able to get rid of the restrictions we imposed in this section .",
    "indeed , we asked for objects to be restricted to finite sets : the reason for this is that dealing with infinite sets implies dealing with infinite sums .",
    "thus infinite sets force us out of the usual domain of definition of matrix determinants .",
    "the second restriction , i.e. that the weight object is a subring of the complex numbers , is also linked to the definition of the determinant .",
    "indeed , the definition of a determinant for matrices over arbitrary semirings is quite involved and has no clear solution @xcite .",
    "lastly , the condition on the norm comes from the very definition of girard s model : execution can not be defined in general when the norm is greater than @xmath162 @xcite .",
    "we will now show how one can define a much more general and satisfying correspondence when dealing with triskells .",
    "such a generalisation will provide many more models since there are fewer restrictions on the weight object @xmath18 .",
    "this is done by introducing notions of determinant and trace of a triskell that generalise the usual definition for complex matrices .",
    "we ask but one thing about these extensions , namely that they map the determinant to the trace through @xmath175 .",
    "that is , we ensure that a generalisation of holds .",
    "the remark above motivates a definition of determinant and trace in the categories of triskells .",
    "this can be done in a coherent way , namely such that the equivalent of holds .",
    "note also that the trace satisfies the property that @xmath223 , and will be used to define a notion of quantitative coherent spaces in @xmath126 .",

    ", the identity map on complex numbers allows one to recover the usual determinant and trace of matrices .",
    "although the trace defined as it is above can be used to deal with matrices over infinite sets , the determinant considered there can not , as one needs to define infinite products for the expression to make sense . given a monoid @xmath233 , we define the extended monoid @xmath234 by adding an absorbing element @xmath235 , i.e. @xmath236 for all @xmath237 .",
