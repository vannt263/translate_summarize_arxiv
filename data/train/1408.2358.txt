    "the last 15 years have seen a significant series of developments in quantum theory , stemming from the realization by bender and co - authors that a class of non - hermitian hamiltonians possess real spectra under the parity - time ( @xmath0 ) symmetry condition , where parity - time means spatial reflection and time reversal , @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this mathematical discovery has initiated numerous studies of open systems with balanced gain and loss even though the generality of this construction is under discussion @xcite .",

    "unexpected instabilities were also identified at the level of @xmath0-symmetric lattices and nonlinear modes were identified in few - site oligomers , as well as in full lattice settings both in 1d  @xcite and even in 2d  @xcite .",
    "extensions of @xmath0-symmetric considerations in the setting of active media ( of unequal gain and loss ) have also recently been proposed  @xcite .    motivated by the linear oscillator problems associated with ( linear ) electrical  @xcite and mechanical  @xcite @xmath0-symmetric experiments ,",
    "klein - gordon field - theoretic generalizations with a @xmath0-symmetric defect have been proposed and the collective variable method has been developed to describe kink dynamics in the system @xcite ; see also for a detailed discussion  @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that standing kinks in such models are stable if they are centered at the loss side of the defect @xcite and standing breather may exist only if centered exactly at the interface between gain and loss regions @xcite .",
    "a natural question arises what happens with the moving klein - gordon solitary waves when they interact with the spatially localized @xmath0-symmetric defect .",
    "interaction of solitary waves with local inhomogeneities of media has been attracting attention of researchers for the last two decades .",

    "it was shown that the incident high - amplitude solitons ( or even linear wavepackets  @xcite ) can excite a mode localized on the @xmath0-symmetric defect . by exciting the localized mode of a large amplitude",
    ", it is possible to perform phase - sensitive control of soliton scattering and amplification or damping of the localized mode .",

    "kinks of the integrable sg equation do not bear internal modes @xcite .",
    "when a kink hits an impurity in a conservative model , a part of its energy is trapped towards the excitation of the impurity mode @xcite and another fraction leads to the emission of radiation bursts @xcite .",
    "a merger of a colliding kink and antikink into a breather is possible in a non - integrable system when energy loss to radiation and/or excitation of the kink s internal modes is sufficiently large @xcite .",

    "conversion of an oscillation mode into a kink - antikink pair has been observed via abrupt distortions of the on - site potential in time or in space @xcite . the recent work of  @xcite illustrated that such an evolution is also possible when the breather is subject to gain e.g. on the gain side of a @xmath0-symmetric medium .",
    "interaction of moving solitons with @xmath0-symmetric defects in the realm of the klein - gordon field , to the best of our knowledge , has not been studied previously , in part , arguably , since @xmath0-symmetric field theories is a very recent theme of research . in this paper",
    ", we aim to reveal the principal physical effects observed during the interaction of sg kinks and breathers with a @xmath0-symmetric defect with balanced gain and loss .",
    "in particular , a kink approaching the @xmath0-symmetric defect from the gain side is always transmitted , while from the loss side it may be reflected or transmitted depending on its energy .",
    "this suggests an asymmetric effective dynamics which is identified by means of an explicitly solvable collective coordinate approach .",
    "we also illustrate how this effective collective dynamics can be modified by the presence of the repulsion from an another kink or of the attraction by an antikink . on the other hand , for the breather the dynamics",
    "is sensitively dependent on both the characteristics of the breather and those of the defect , potentially exhibiting either gain or loss of energy for the coherent structure ( the former possibly even featuring the breakup of the breather into a kink and an anti - kink waveforms ) .",

    "[ fig9](b ) both kink and antikink have @xmath143 nevertheless , they _ both _",
    "pass through the defect .",
    "two reasons can be given to explain this effect and they both are related to the fact that the kink and antikink form a breather to pass through the defect . in sec .",
    "[ sec : breather ] it was shown that the breather can gain energy from the @xmath0-symmetric defect , depending on the phase , and this is the first reason .",
    "the second reason is that the breather translational degree of freedom is only weakly affected by the perturbation considered in this study .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] where we contrast the dynamics of breathers and kinks with initial velocities equal to 0.1 , 0.2 and 0.3 in the case of homogeneous loss @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "the breather initial frequency is @xmath124 .",
    "it can be seen that the kink trajectories ( smooth lines ) show that kink propagation velocity gradually decreases , while breather trajectories ( wavy lines ) demonstrate almost constant propagation velocities .",
    "hence , this suggests that while breathers are topologically robust , breathers are more efficient in weathering lossy media and in overcoming barriers imposed by dissipative perturbations . this is a feature that is especially useful in the realm of @xmath0-symmetric perturbations / defects .     and @xmath148",
    ". the breather initial frequency is @xmath124 .",
    "the kink trajectories ( smooth lines ) show that kink propagation velocity gradually decreases , while breather trajectories ( wavy lines ) demonstrate almost constant propagation velocities , i.e. , minimal impact in the breather translation by the presence of the dissipative perturbation.,width=377 ]",
    "interaction of sg kinks ( and multi - kinks ) as well as breathers with a @xmath0-symmetric defect bearing balanced regions of positive and negative dissipation of energy was investigated analytically ( wherever possible ) and numerically in the present work .",
    "it was demonstrated that a kink coming from the gain side always passes through the defect and restores its initial velocity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the only effect of the interaction with the defect is a phase shift associated with the kink position .",
    "however , for the kink approaching the defect from the opposite side , there exist two different scenarios , depending on the kink initial velocity @xmath22 . for @xmath143 , where @xmath89 is a threshold value of the velocity",
    ", the kink does not have enough energy to pass through the defect and it is trapped by the lossy side of the defect ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) , while for @xmath144 it is able to overcome the relevant barrier .",
    "if two well - separated kinks approach the defect from the lossy side with the velocities less than @xmath89 , then one of them can pass through the defect while another one will be either trapped by the lossy region or reflected back ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , i.e. , their pairwise repulsion may modify the collisional outcome with the defect .",
    "the breather - defect interaction is more interesting since the breather can split into subkinks depending on its parameters and also on the amplitude of the defect .",
    "depending on the breather initial phase , its total energy can be increased or decreased after the interaction with the defect ( see fig .  [ fig6 ] and fig .  [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the kinetic energy of the moving breather is a periodic function of time and space with sharp maxima at the points where the subkinks collide .",
    "the type of perturbation considered in the present work is more prominent for large @xmath105 .",
    "change in the breather phase changes the location of the subkink collision points with respect to the maxima of the gain and loss regions thus affecting the overall result of the interaction between the breather and the defect ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "a well - separated kink and antikink pair moving toward the lossy side of the defect with @xmath143 , may enable _ both _ coherent structures to potentially pass through the defect [ see fig .",
    "[ fig9](b ) ] .",
    "this happens because the kink and antikink form a breather that can gain energy from the defect and whose propagation velocity is less affected by the dissipative term than the propagation velocity of the constituent kink or antikink ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath0-symmetric defects give new opportunities in the manipulation with the soliton dynamics in the sine - gordon equation and related field theories .",
    "numerous future directions open up as a result of the present considerations .",
    "one such is to consider other klein - gordon field theories in the presence of @xmath0-symmetric defects , such as , e.g. , the @xmath3 model .",
    "the latter is especially interesting due to the presence of internal modes in the kink dynamics which may have a nontrivial impact on the observed phenomenology .",
    "another relevant consideration is that of higher dimensionality .",
    "examining radial kinks as well as breathers in the higher dimensional versions of the sine - gordon model is a theme that has attracted recent interest  @xcite , including the formation of breathers as a result of the interaction of the kinks with a radial domain boundary . developing @xmath0-symmetric variants of the 2d sine - gordon and examining the corresponding dynamics is still an open problem .",
    "finally , comparison of the present features with corresponding bright and dark soliton interactions with @xmath0-symmetric defects within the realm of the focusing and defocusing respectively @xmath0-symmetric nonlinear schrdinger equation would also be a theme of relevance to future studies , especially since the latter is the principal field of optical applications of @xmath0-symmetric models .",
