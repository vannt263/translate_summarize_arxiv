    "during the last decade , the relationship between quantum phase transitions and entanglement has become an important research domain @xcite .",
    "although it is natural to expect some deep changes in the ground state of a system at a transition point , the real problem is to measure these variations or , in other words , to characterize the quantum state structure . in most cases ,",
    "the study of an order parameter or the behavior of correlation functions is sufficient to detect and analyze a phase transition but one may wonder whether more ",
    "intrinsic \" measures could be helpful . following pioneering works in one - dimensional spin models @xcite",
    ", many studies have been devoted to this problem ( see ref .   for a review ) , but only a few allow for an exact solution in the thermodynamic limit which is a key ingredient to characterize a phase transition .",
    "the goal of this paper is to propose a class of simple , fully connected ( collective ) models in which ground - state entanglement properties can be studied in details .",
    "these models , in which degrees of freedom ( spins 1/2 ) mutually interact , can be seen as generalizations of the lipkin - meshkov - glick model @xcite for which most entanglement features are now well known @xcite .",
    "the main reason for introducing these collective systems is that they not only allow us to study a second - order phase transition as in the lipkin - meshkov - glick model , but also allow the study of first - order transitions . as surprising as it may seem , although `` collective '' may be thought to lead to a pure mean - field behavior , we will see that the is deeply entangled .",
    "furthermore , although it might be naively expected that entanglement measures will simply display jumps at first - order transitions , we will show that this does not hold for one of the models , the spectral properties of which show some similarities with those of a system exhibiting a second - order transition .",
    "the study of these collective systems is also motivated by the fact that they are much simpler to analyze than their nearest - neighbor counterparts on a finite - dimensional lattice .",
    "indeed , most entanglement measures rely on a multi - partition of the microscopic degrees of freedom . for instance , the concurrence @xcite is obtained by separating a system of @xmath0 spins into two parts ( of sizes @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) , the rnyi entropy is obtained by splitting it into two parts of arbitrary sizes ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) , a tri - partition is required to compute the negativity @xcite of a mixed state , etc .",
    "thus , the main problem often consists of computing reduced density matrices for a given partition . in the models studied below , this crucial step can be achieved since the original spin problem can be mapped onto a quadratic bosonic hamiltonian .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ sec : models_qpt ] , we introduce a family of models and compute their low - energy spectrum ( ground - state energy and gap ) .",
    "this allows us to determine their phase diagram and characterize the quantum phase transitions .",
    "analytical expressions are obtained in the thermodynamical limit and compared with exact diagonalization results . in sec .",
    "[ sec : entanglement_measures ] , we discuss the ground - state entanglement by focusing on three different measures  : the concurrence , the rnyi entropy , and the negativity , which rely on a one - mode , two - mode , and three - mode description of the bosonic hamiltonian , respectively . once again",
    ", exact results in the thermodynamical limit are compared to numerical data for a representative set of parameters .",
    "we consider a system made of @xmath0 spins 1/2 whose hamiltonian reads @xmath5.\\ ] ] in the above equation , @xmath6 are total spin operators along the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 direction , with @xmath10 being the usual pauli matrix at site @xmath11 and @xmath12 denotes the maximum spin value .",
    "this class of models is defined by the non - negative integer parameters @xmath13 . in what follows",
    ", we shall refer to a model with given values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 as the @xmath16 model .    without loss of generality",
    ", we shall restrict ourselves to @xmath17 .",
    "we furthermore exclude the trivial case @xmath18 , since it describes a large spin in a magnetic field , and only displays a crossover , but no quantum phase transition .",
    "the @xmath19 model is a collective version of the transverse - field ising model , known as the lipkin - meshkov - glick model @xcite .",
    "the @xmath20 models are multispin generalizations of such a model .",
    "the @xmath21 model can be seen as a collective version of the quantum compass model @xcite .",
    "note that , in two dimensions , the latter is dual to the xu - moore model @xcite , but the collective version of the xu - moore model , namely , the @xmath22 model , is not dual to the @xmath21 model ( in fact , as will be seen below , the latter two models have rather different properties ) .    as we shall see , all models under consideration exhibit a quantum phase transition when the control parameter @xmath23 $ ] is varied .",
    "this quantum phase transition occurs at @xmath24 , provided one imposes @xmath25 to take the following value @xcite : @xmath26 these values can be found easily ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : sub : sub : gse ] for details ) .    finally , let us note that all hamiltonians preserve the magnitude of the total spin , _ i.  e. _ , @xmath27=0 $ ] .",
    "when @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is even , the hamiltonian furthermore has a spin - flip symmetry since it commutes with @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "physically , the quantum phase transition stems from the competition between the ferromagnetic @xmath14-spin interaction in the @xmath30 direction and the ferromagnetic @xmath15-spin interaction in the @xmath9 direction if @xmath31 , or magnetic field in the @xmath9 direction if @xmath32 .",
    "a numerical study provides an idea about the phase transitions of the various models .",
    "such a study can be performed for rather large number of spins since , as already mentioned , the hamiltonians commute with @xmath33 . the collective and ferromagnetic nature of the interactions implies that one can focus on the maximum spin sector @xmath12 ( of dimension @xmath34 ) where the ground state is found . the energies per spin @xmath35 of six different models",
    "are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_n16 ] and [ fig : spectrum_n256 ] , for @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively . from the evolution of the full spectra between these two figures",
    ", one can infer the behavior of the various models in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "the @xmath19 model displays a collapse of levels onto the ground state , at the transition point @xmath24 , but the ground - state energy displays no cusp . from these features ,",
    "the quantum phase transition is likely to be of second order .",
    "all other models ( except the @xmath21 model ) have avoided level crossings , which tend to become true level crossings in the thermodynamical limit . in particular , the ground - state energy has a cusp , and the transition is of first order .",
    "note that , in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_n256 ] , the darker regions are those where one finds many levels ( which are finite - size precursors of singularities in the density of states in the thermodynamical limit ) .",
    "but , contrary to what happens for the @xmath19 model @xcite , these regions do not touch the ground - state energy at the transition .",
    "this is , however , not true for the @xmath21 model , which displays both a collapse of levels onto the ground state as well as a cusp in the ground - state energy . from the second feature ,",
    "one concludes that the transition is first order , although the first feature is reminiscent of a second - order quantum phase transition .",
    "let us stress that the @xmath21 model is trivially integrable at the transition point , since its hamiltonian reads @xmath38 , where @xmath39 .",
    "this additional symmetry ( @xmath40=0 $ ] ) is responsible for the presence of non - avoided level crossings at the transition point , even at finite @xmath0 .",
    "actually , all these models are exactly solvable , but not in such a trivial way @xcite .",
    "it is this variety of behaviors displayed by the different models that motivates the study of entanglement measures and their sensitivity to the characteristics of the quantum phase transition . before turning to this ,",
    "we shall , however , provide analytical results for the low - energy spectrum , which will allow us to introduce the basic techniques needed to perform analytical computations of entanglement measures .",
