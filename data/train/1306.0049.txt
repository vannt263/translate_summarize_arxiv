    "radiation and/or magnetic fields , relativity , and resistivity play crucial roles in a number of high - energy astrophysical phenomena , such as black - hole accretion - disks , jets , disk winds , pulsar winds , magnetar flares , core collapse supernovae , and gamma - ray bursts .",
    "for example , the geometrically thick disk is supported by the radiation pressure , which dominates the total pressure , in the case of near- or super - critical accretion rate .",
    "the radiation force is thought to accelerate the matter , producing jets or winds .",
    "in contrast , the radiation drag reduces the velocity of the relativistic outflow .",
    "the magnetic field lines enhanced in the inner part of the accretion disks launch jets / outflows @xcite . the magnetorotational instability ( mri )",
    "is thought to be origin of the disk viscosity , by which the angular momentum is transported outward @xcite .",
    "the resistivity would cause conversion from the magnetic energy to the energy of the matter through the magnetic reconnection . also , the resistivity might influence the evolution and/or saturation of mri in the disks .    a global structure of the accretion disks and outflows",
    "is investigated by radiation hydrodynamics ( rhd ) simulations @xcite , magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) simulations @xcite , and radiation - mhd ( rmhd ) simulations @xcite .",
    "especially , @xcite showed high - velocity jets , which is magnetically collimated , are powered by the radiation force .",
    "also rmhd simulations of local patch of the disk are performed @xcite .",
    "although such works were great successful , they should extent to relativistic simulations .",
    "many approximate methods have been proposed to solve the radiation transfer , since the computational cost for rigorous method is too expensive to perform . in the flux - limited diffusion ( fld )",
    "approximation , a zeroth moment equation of the radiation transfer equation is solved to update the radiation energy density .",
    "the radiation flux as well as the radiation stress tensor is given based on the gradient of the radiation energy density .",
    "the fld is a quite useful technique and gives appropriate radiation fields within the optically thick regime , but it does not always give precise radiation fields in the regime where the optical depth is around unity or less ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast to the fld approximation , both zeroth and first moment equations are solved in the eddington approximation . however , this method is somewhat problematic for anisotropic radiation fields , since the eddington tensor is evaluated by assuming the isotropic radiation fields . additionally , the speed of light is effectively reduced in this method . although the variable eddington tensor method proposed by @xcite is known to give better results , it is so complex and expensive .",
    "one of the reasonable method is so - called m-1 closure , in which the eddington tensor is obtained as a function of the radiation energy density and radiation flux @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy of radiation fields is approximately taken into consideration , and the radiation propagates with speed of light in an optically thin medium .",
    "the m-1 closure is adopted to non - relativistic radiation hydrodynamic code , and recently to general relativistic ( gr ) code @xcite .",
    "another truncated moment formalism of radiation fields in optically thick and thin limits was proposed by @xcite .",
    "relativistic rmhd or rhd simulations were recently initiated .",
    "@xcite first proposed a numerical scheme of gr - rmhd , in which the eddington approximation is employed .",
    "@xcite adopted a general relativistic rmhd code to the bondi - hoyle accretion on to the black holes . however , in their works , the explicit integration method is employed even for the gas - radiation interaction . in the relativistic phenomena , the dynamical timescale as well as the timescale , that the characteristic wave passes the system , could be comparable to the light crossing time .",
    "thus , although the numerical timestep becomes slightly short via the explicit treatment of the propagating radiation , the computational cost does not increase so much .",
    "in contrast , if the absorption / scattering opacity is so large , the timescale of gas - radiation interaction could be much shorter than the other timescales , making the computation to be time consuming .",
    "in the non - relativistic rhd / rmhd simulations , such a difficulty is avoided by that the gas - radiation interaction terms are implicitly solved .",
    "we should employ such an implicit treatment in the relativistic code @xcite .    for resistive simulations ,",
    "the magnetic energy dissipation should be implicitly solved to relax the courant - friedrichs - lewy condition in the regime of a large magnetic reynolds number . here",
    "note that including the resistivity is a lot more complicated in the relativistic mhd than in the non - relativistic mhd , since we have to solve four additional equations for calculating the time evolution of the electric fields and charge density .",
    "the numerical treatment of relativistic mhd simulations with resistivity were developed by authors @xcite .",
    "the relativistic resistive rmhd simulations are challenging task .",
    "in the present paper , we propose an explicit - implicit scheme for solving special relativistic rmhd ( sr - rmhd ) and special relativistic resistive rmhd ( sr - r2mhd ) equations . here , the radiation fields in the observer frame are used and we solve zeroth and first moment equations with the m-1 method . since the m-1 closure is constructed for the radiation energy momentum tensor to be covariant ,",
    "the lorentz transformation for the radiation fields is unnecessary in our procedure .",
    "our scheme ensures a conservation of total energy and momentum ( matter , magnetic field , and radiation ) .",
    "an advection of magnetofluids and the radiation is explicitly solved , and the gas - radiation interaction as well as the magnetic energy dissipation via the resistivity is implicitly treated .",
    "note that , although we propose sr code in the present study , the extension to the gr version would be straightforward except for the m-1 closure .",
    "the procedure of the m-1 closure in gr code is shown in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in   [ method ] , we introduce argument equations for sr - rmhd and sr - r2mhd . the numerical scheme is explained in ",

    "by the procedures so far , the advection terms are already solved , and the gas - radiation interaction ( equation [ [ eq : dsource ] ] ) remains only .",
    "hence , we obtain two of the conserved variables at the next timestep , @xmath113 and @xmath114 . in addition , although gas - radiation interaction changes energy and momentum for the gas and radiation , total energy and momentum of radiation magnetofluids in a local grid are conserved .",

    "although the radiation energy is transported up to merely @xmath367 for eddington model , the leftward radiation penetrates to @xmath368 for m-1 model .",
    "since the speed of light is effectively reduced to @xmath352 as we have discussed above , the leftward radiation flux suddenly decreases via the enhanced absorption for the eddington model .",
    "therefore , in the m-1 model , the profile of the radiation energy density is smooth , the radiation energy density is enhanced even at the range of @xmath369 .",
    "the leftward radiation flux in the upstream region induces the leftward radiation force ( bottom panel ) , which works to decrease the velocity .",
    "hence , the velocity ( density ) starts to decrease ( increase ) at @xmath368 for m-1 model and @xmath367 for eddington model ( see top and second panels ) .",
    "the bottom panel clearly shows that the pressure gradient force is weaker than the radiation force .",
    "here we note that , in contrast with rhdst1 , the precursor strongly affects on the upstream gas since a radiation energy much exceeds a gas energy density in the present test .",
    "lastly , we perform a sr - r2mhd simulation of a relativistic magnetic reconnection . recently , some authors have studied the relativistic magnetic reconnection without radiation by assuming uniform resistivity model @xcite and a spatially localized resistivity model @xcite .",

    "are symmetric and the vector components are anti - symmetric .",
    "the free boundary conditions are applied at the other boundaries .",
    "we assume an isothermal and uniform gas , @xmath376 and @xmath377 in a whole domain at the initial state .",

    "a blue line denotes a position at which there is a steep jump on @xmath395 in the first quadrant .    due to an enhancement of the electric resistivity at the origin ,",
    "magnetic field lines start to reconnect and the gas is evacuated as outflows in the @xmath396-directions . since we adopt a spatially localized resistivity model , four slow shocks attached to the diffusion region form ( one of them is indicated by a blue curve ) @xcite .",
    "this indicates that a fast petschek type magnetic reconnection is realized even though the radiation field is fulfilled .",
    "we can see that the radiation energy density is confined in exhausts of outflows .",
    "the photons suffer from numerous scattering , since the system is very optically thick for scattering .",
    "thus , the radiation flows together with matter via advection , and @xmath34 is almost parallel to velocity fields .",
    "this implies that the reconnection region is very brightly observed for downstream observers ( on @xmath70-axis ) . on the other hand",

    "this figure clearly shows that the electromagnetic force accelerates the gas and the pressure gradient force is negligible .",
    "the matter is decelerated by the radiation force .",
    "such a deceleration is caused by the radiation drag ( @xmath398 ) which becomes non - negligible compared with the radiation flux force ( @xmath399 ) , when @xmath400 . in the present problem , the condition of @xmath400 is moderately realised since the large optical thickness reduces the radiation flux .",
    "the typical value of @xmath401 is around unity . in the present problem ,",
    "the radiation drag is also non - negligible compared with the electromagnetic force . here , we recover a light speed @xmath247 to avoid misunderstanding .",
    "the ratio of the radiation drag to the electromagnetic force is @xmath402 , where we assume a mildly relativistic plasma and estimate the radiation drag and the electromagnetic force as @xmath403 and @xmath404 with @xmath291 being a typical length of the current sheet for the order estimation .",
    "such a ratio is rewritten as @xmath405 , where @xmath406 is the magnetic energy density and @xmath407 is the optical depth of the current sheet .",
    "it implies that the radiation drag tends to play an important role for magnetic reconnection in the high density and high velocity plasma . in our simulations",
    ", we have @xmath408 by assuming @xmath409 and @xmath410 . due to the radiation drag ,",
    "the outflow four velocity is about 10% slower with the radiation field than without the radiation field in our parameter set .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mrxrate ] , we show a time evolution of reconnection rate , which is here defined by @xmath411 ( @xmath70- and @xmath221-components of the electric fields are null by definition ) .",
    "solid and dashed curves are results with and without solving radiation field , respectively . due to an enhancement of the localized resistivity ,",
    "magnetic field lines start to reconnect and amplitude of electric field rapidly increases by dissipating the magnetic energy .",
    "after @xmath412 , quasi steady state is realized and the reconnection rate roughly becomes constant .",
    "the reconnection rate at the steady state is about 10% smaller with the radiation field than without the radiation field .",
    "it is understood as below .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the radiation drag force slows down the outflow velocity .",
    "then , the inflow velocity in the quasi steady state ( downward and upward component of the velocity in the regions of @xmath413 and @xmath414 ) is also reduced .",
    "thus , the @xmath397-component of the electric fields , [ @xmath415 , decreases , inducing the reduction of the magnetic reconnection rate .",
    "although we show the results for one parameter set , the reconnection rate as well as the outflow velocity , would depend on initial parameters .",

    "we developed a special relativistic radiation - magnetohydrodynamic ( sr - rmhd ) code , in which the m-1 closure method is employed and a source term for gas - radiation interaction is implicitly and iteratively integrated .",
    "we also extend our sr - rmhd code to a special relativistic resistive radiation - mhd ( sr - r2mhd ) code , which includes electric resistivity .",
    "our sr - rmhd code successfully solves some of test problems , i.e. , shock tube problems of mhd / radiation - hd and propagating radiation , and we demonstrate the radiation drag effect in relativistic petschek type magnetic reconnection by sr - r2mhd code .    since our code use radiation fields only in the observer s frame , we straightforwardly compute @xmath35 from @xmath33 and @xmath34 through the m-1 closure method without the lorentz transformation .",
    "in contrast , the lorentz transformation is inevitable for the eddington approximation . by virtue of m-1 closure method , anisotropic propagation of radiation",
    "is solved and the propagating speed of the radiation is @xmath247 in the optically thin media .",
    "the eddington approximation as well as flux - limited diffusion approximation is problematic for such anisotropy .",
    "in addition , the speed of light is reduced to be @xmath265 for the eddington approximation .    in our code , all of advection terms are explicitly integrated by setting the timestep to be a fraction of @xmath416 with @xmath76 being the grid spacing",
    ". implicit integration of the source term prevents the timestep from shortening when the timescale of the source term ( e.g. , gas - radiation interaction ) becomes very small . for the implicit treatment , we directly invert a @xmath0 matrix at each grid point in sr - rmhd code .",
    "in addition to the gas - radiation interaction term , the source term appeared in ampere s law is also solved implicitly in sr - r2mhd code .",
    "then , we need to invert @xmath1 and @xmath0 matrices at each grid point . such matrix inversion is carried out analytically without communication with neighbor grids .",
