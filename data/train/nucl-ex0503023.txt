    "a key question of the heavy ion program at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is to understand whether the hot and dense matter produced in the midst of the relativistic heavy ion collisions undergoes a transition to and from a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase before it hadronizes .",
    "the study of fluctuations of specific observables on event by event basis , can provide comprehensive insight in this matter [ 1 - 7 ] .",
    "several recent experimental studies at the sps and rhic have focused on the study of fluctuations in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "results from na49 experiment at sps @xcite show interesting behavior of both @xmath0 ratio as well as the event by event dynamical fluctuation in that quantity . in this paper",
    "we present preliminary results from studies on the event by event fluctuation in the @xmath0 ratio for au+au collisions at @xmath1 = 200 gev and at 62.4 gev using the star detector at rhic .",
    "star experiment at rhic measures charged hadrons over a wide range of pseudorapidity ( @xmath2 ) and azimuthal angle ( @xmath3 ) , using the large time projection chamber @xcite .",
    "an overview of the experiment can be found in @xcite .",
    "the kaons and pions are identified based on their relative energy deposition ( de / dx ) in the tpc within the momentum range of 100 mev - 600 mev .",
    "this wide acceptance of the detector enhances the possibility to study event by event physics .",
    "specially the wide momentum range available for particle identification enables to study event by event fluctuation in @xmath0 ratio .",
    "we have used the dataset from rhic run ii for au+au 200 gev and rhic run iv for au+au at 62.4 gev .",
    "around 300k minimum bias events , corresponding to 0 - 80% of au+au hadronic interaction cross - section , are analysed for this work . in minimum bias mode",
    "the events were triggered by two zdcs and a minimum signal at the ctb .",
    "only events for which the z - vertex is within @xmath4 cm of the center of the tpc are accepted .",
    "the global tracks with at least 15 hits in tpc and z component of distant of closest approach ( dca ) of the track with the primary vertex is less than 3 cm are used in this analysis .",
    "two separate methods of analysis are used , one to obtain the overall measure of the dynamical fluctuation in central events and the other one to obtain the centrality dependence of the dynamical fluctuation .",
    "the kaons and pions in each event are identified from their relative energy deposition in tpc",
    ". then the ratio of multiplicities of kaons and pions is obtained on event by event basis .",
    "the width ( @xmath5 ) of the distribution of this ratio for sufficiently large number of events , gives the fluctuation in the ratio for real data . in order to isolate the strength of non - statistical fluctuation ,",
    "we need to establish a reference which tells us the contribution to fluctuation from finite number of particles detected in the detector , experimental resolution in de / dx but not containing any further correlations between the particles .",
    "this statistical limit corresponding to uncorrelated kaon and pion production , is estimated based on the ratio of kaon and pion multiplicities obtained from pseudo events constructed using a mixed event technique ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this mixing of the events has been done picking up one track from every event randomly to construct one mixed event while the multiplicity of the mixed events follow that of the real events .",
    "the dynamical fluctuation in the quantity has been obtained by the formula    @xmath7    this approach was used by na49 to measure the strength of dynamical fluctuation for central events at various sps energies .",
    "we have therefore used this to compare our results with those from sps .",

    "[ sigma200 ] shows the distribution of @xmath0 ratio for top 5% central events in au+au collisions at 200 gev .",
    "the distributions obtained from real and mixed events are superimposed to help comparing the widths of the distributions .",
    "the values of @xmath9 in different cases are tabulated in the table below .    in fig .",
    "[ sigmaexcitation ] the energy dependence ( excitation function ) of @xmath9 is plotted .",
