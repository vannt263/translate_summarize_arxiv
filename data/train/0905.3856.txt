    "the interplay between transport currents and magnetization dynamics continues to be a major research topic in ferromagnetic metal spintronics.@xcite the current understanding of this class of phenomena has been derived mainly from numerous studies of spin - transfer torques ( stts ) , which arise when spin polarized currents traverse _ non - collinear _ magnetic systems .",
    "stts can be exploited to achieve current - induced magnetization reversal and current - induced domain - wall motion , both of which have potentially important technological applications .",
    "there have been comparatively few studies of the influence of transport currents on magnetization in _ uniform _ ferromagnets , presumably because spin transfer torques vanish in these systems . yet , as pointed out independently by several researchers@xcite , current - induced reorientation of magnetization does occur in some uniform ferromagnets .",
    "the first experimental fingerprint of this phenomenon was uncovered by chernyshov _",
    "et al._@xcite who demonstrated that an electric current alters magnetization reversal characteristics in strained ( ga , mn)as films with a single magnetic domain .    stts can be considered to be one member of a family of current - induced torque ( cit ) effects by which transport currents influence magnetization in ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic@xcite systems .",
    "the aim of this paper is to contribute to the theoretical analysis of current - induced torques in uniformly magnetized ferromagnets .    in sec .",
    "ii we study the effect responsible for this type of torque , which we refer to as the ferromagnetic inverse spin - galvanic effect.@xcite in non - magnetic conductors the inverse spin - galvanic effect ( isge ) refers to current - induced spin density .",
    "since a non - zero spin - density already appears in the equilibrium state of a ferromagnet , the ferromagnetic inverse spin - galvanic effect has a distinct experimental signature .",
    "specifically , we find that in gyrotropic ferromagnets the magnetization direction is altered by a steady - state transport current . at a conceptual level ,",
    "we associate this reorientation with a change in magnetic anisotropy in the presence of a transport current .",
    "an important implication of this connection is that the magnetic anisotropy energy in the transport steady state of a ferromagnet which exhibits the isge is _ not _ invariant under magnetization reversal , essentially because the applied current breaks time reversal invariance . at a practical level",
    ", we provide a concise analytical expression for the current - induced change in the magnetic anisotropy .",
    "this expression is suitable for evaluation from first principles because it requires the knowledge of only the band structure of the ferromagnet and the lifetime of the bloch states . at a technical level",
    ", our theory allows for the spatial inhomogeneities that inevitably occur in the _ magnitude _ of the ferromagnet s exchange field at atomic lenghtscales .    in sec .",
    "iii we carry out quantitative calculations for the isge of strained ( ga , mn)as using a 4-band kohn - luttinger model .",
    "this calculation directly addresses the experiment by chernyshov _",
    "et al._@xcite and corroborates their interpretation of the data . by computing the anisotropy field both in absence and in presence of an electric current",
    ", we find that in ( ga , mn)as magnetization reversal may in principle be achieved solely by electric means : the required critical current densities are in the order of @xmath0 and depend on the strain , mn concentration and hole density . sec .",
    "iv contains a brief summary and presents our conclusions .",
    "the main conclusions of our work coincide with those reached by manchon and zhang in their independent and previously published work described in ref .",
    "yet , our analysis highlights aspects that have not been emphasized previously .",
    "first , we assert that in ferromagnets with inversion symmetry , the current - induced spin - density vanishes _ to all orders _ in the strength of the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "second , when evaluating the current - induced spin polarization we include a contribution from interband coherence which can become quantitatively important in disordered ferromagnets such as ( ga , mn)as .",
    "third , we identify the current - induced transverse spin - density associated with the isge in ferromagnets as a consequence of a change in magnetic anisotropy in the presence of an electric current .",
    "we thus promote transport currents to the same status as temperature@xcite , gate voltages@xcite , strain@xcite and chemical processes@xcite , all of which are well - established control parameters for the tuning of magnetic anisotropy .",
    "in non - magnetic metals or semiconductors that are gyrotropic , _ i.e. _ non - centrosymmetric _ and _ chiral,@xcite a dc charge current is generically accompanied by a non - zero spin polarization.@xcite this phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the inverse spin galvanic effect ( isge).@xcite because of the advent of spintronics and subsequent attempts to control spin polarization by electric means , even in paramagnetic materials , the isge has received widespread experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite attention . the isge is purely a consequence of symmetry since i ) current , which is odd under time reversal , is the dissipative response of a conductor to a dc electric - field , ii ) spin is also odd under time reversal and therefore allowed as part of the dissipative response , and iii ) axial vectors ( like spin ) and polar vectors ( like current ) are coupled in gyrotropic materials.@xcite the direction of the carriers spin is determined by the direction of the electric field as well as by the axis along which inversion symmetry is broken.@xcite    the isge is sometimes viewed as a possible route toward the development of spintronics effects in paramagnetic materials that are as robust as effects like giant magnetoresistance that occur only in ferromagnetic materials .",
    "partly because spin - orbit interactions tend to be fairly weak , it appears to be difficult to make spin - galvanic effects in normal metals useful . in this section",
    "we turn the tables on this strategy by concentrating on the inverse spin - galvanic effect in _ magnetic _ conductors .    in uniformly magnetized ferromagnets with inversion symmetry ,",
    "the transport current is spin polarized because the conductivities of majority and minority spin channels are different .",
    "this familiar fact is unrelated to the isge .",
    "since spin - polarization is already present in the thermodynamic equilibrium state of a ferromagnet , the ferromagnetic isge is manifested not by the presence of a non - zero spin - density but instead by a change in magnetization direction in the non - equilibrium steady - state which is dependent on the magnitude and direction of the electric field . in this paper",
    "we formulate a theory of the isge in ferromagnets by evaluating the torque which acts on the collective magnetization of a magnetic conductor due to spin - orbit interactions in the presence of a transport current .",
    "when the current is set to zero , the torque we evaluate vanishes along easy ( and hard ) magnetization directions and is normally viewed@xcite as a precessional torque due to magnetocrystalline anisotropy fields .",
    "these torques are in turn associated with the magnetization - direction dependence of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy . at zero current , the anisotropy torques must change sign when the magnetization direction is reversed because time reversal symmetry requires that the anisotropy energy be invariant under reversal . the ferromagnetic isge in gyrotropic crystals",
    "may be viewed as a change in anisotropy torque due to a transport current .",
    "significantly , the isge torques are _ not _ odd under magnetization reversal .",
    "the ferromagnetic isge is reminiscent of the magnetoelectric phenomena that have been extensively studied in multiferroic materials,@xcite _ i.e. _ materials in which magnetism coexists with ferroelectricity .",
    "a common characteristic of multiferroic perovskites is the presence of canted magnetism that stems from the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction . since the direction of canting is determined by the symmetry of the crystal , one can envisage@xcite scenarios in which an electric - field - mediated reversal of the ferroelectric polarization causes a simultaneous reversal of the canting angle or of the magnetization . another interesting property of multiferroic materials is the coupling between ferroelectricity and antiferromagnetism.@xcite this coupling makes it possible to switch the magnetization of an exchange - biased ferromagnet by the application of an electric field . in spite of the contextual similarities ,",
    "there are fundamental differences between the aforementioned phenomena and the ferromagnetic isge .",
    "for one thing , ferroelectricity occurs only in insulators while the isge occurs only in conductors .",
    "we evaluate the ferromagnetic isge microscopically within the framework of linear response theory ( fig .",

    "(  [ eq : chi ] ) @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the @xmath14-dependent matrix - elements of the spin and velocity operators ( @xmath15 ) between bloch states ( @xmath16 ) in bands @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "note that the bloch states are in general spinors in which orbital and spin degrees of freedom are entangled .",

    "for simplicity we have ignored disorder vertex corrections to both velocity and spin operators . in the numerical calculations discussed in section iii",
    "we will in addition take the quasiparticle lifetime to be a phenomenological parameter which is independent of momentum and band labels .",
    "as we discuss below , the transverse components of the spin - density are directly related to the anisotropy field , which exerts a torque on the macrospin . on the same footing , the current - induced contribution to the transverse spin density",

    "consequently , the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi ] ) vanishes after summing over all @xmath14 . from a crystal symmetry classification standpoint",
    "there are 21 non - centrosymmetric crystal classes , among which three ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) are not gyrotropic .",
    "the occurence of the isge is therefore restricted to 18 crystal classes.@xcite    the main objective of this section is to relate the ferromagnetic isge to a current - induced change in the magnetic anisotropy field , yet before we do so it is beneficial to pave the way by reviewing the nuances of magnetic anisotropy in electric equilibrium . in the absence of currents ,",
    "magnetic anisotropy describes the dependence of the free energy of a ferromagnet on the direction of its magnetization.@xcite magnetic anisotropy originates from@xcite magnetic dipolar interactions and spin - orbit interactions .",
    "the former lead to shape anisotropy in non - spherical samples while the latter produce magnetocrystalline anisotropy by communicating the lack of rotational symmetry in the crystalline lattice to the spin degrees of freedom . in practice ,",
    "magnetic anisotropy reveals itself in dynamical processes such as ferromagnetic resonance through an anisotropy field that forces the magnetization to precess unless it is along an easy or hard axis , _ i.e. _ along a direction in which the anisotropy energy is minimized or maximized .",
    "this precessional magnetization dynamics is properly characterized by the landau - lifshitz equation , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the direction of the ferromagnet s collective dynamical variable ( which may be chosen to be either the magnetization or the ferromagnetic exchange field ) and @xmath32 is an effective magnetic field , taken here to include reactive as well as dissipative processes.@xcite the anisotropy field may then be defined as the contribution to the non - dissipative part of the effective magnetic field which survives in the absence of true magnetic fields : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the ground state energy of the ferromagnet in equilibrium ( we take zero temperature throughout ) and @xmath35 is the total spin ( magnetization@xmath36 volume ) of the ferromagnet .",

    "@xmath31 is assumed to be uniform in space but the magnitude @xmath46 of the exchange field is allowed to have spatial dependence at the atomic lengthscale.@xcite we neglect dipolar interactions since they are not directly influenced by currents and can normally be cleanly separated from magnetocrystalline anisotropy .",

    "the procedure sketched above accomplishes magnetization switching by application of two perpendicular current pulses , each of which forces a @xmath150 rotation .",
    "yet , it is also possible to achieve the @xmath154\\to[{\\bar 1}00]$ ] switching with a single _ unidirectional _ pulse , provided the electric field along [ 100 ] is ramped up sufficiently ( @xmath155 for the parameters of the present figure ) . in order to understand this , recall that @xmath156 . consequently , for a strong electric current [ @xmath14100 ]",
    "is the only easy direction ( [ 100 ] becomes a hard direction ) .",
    "the inequivalence between [ 100 ] and [ @xmath13600 ] does not violate any symmetry principles;@xcite in effect , an electric current breaks time reversal symmetry and can thus connect time - reversed magnetic states .",
    "using @xmath157 as the typical resistivity for ( ga , mn)as samples we deduce that @xmath158 corresponds approximately to a current density of @xmath159 , hence the critical switching current is on the order of @xmath0 .",
    "it is plausible that a detailed exploration of the parameter space comprised by the mn concentration @xmath160 , the hole density @xmath161 and the axial strain @xmath162 will enable lower critical currents , thereby diminishing the importance of the joule heating . as a word of caution",
    ", we note that the 4-band model employed here typically overestimates the effect of spin - orbit interactions , thus potentially leading to an underestimate of these critical currents .",
    "there is in addition some uncertainty associated with the use of a life - time approximation for bloch state quasiparticles in these strongly disordered metallic conducting ferromagnets .",
    "overall , the magnitude of the critical switching current depends on ( a ) the size of the equilibrium anisotropy barrier , ( b ) the extent to which inversion symmetry is broken and ( c ) the strength of spin - orbit interaction . in ( ga ,",
    "mn)as the first two factors are tunable .",
    "on one hand , ( a ) may be optimized by choosing appropriate doping concentrations : in general lower mn density is beneficial ( fig .",
    "( [ fig : critical ] ) ) , as it reduces the equilibrium anisotropy without significantly affecting the magnitude of isge . however , for very low mn concentrations a metal - insulator transition is impending , which hampers isge . on the other hand , ( b ) may be modified via strain engineering : as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : critical ] ) , the critical current is ( roughly ) inversely proportional to the strength of the uniaxial strain that breaks inversion symmetry .",
    "the inverse proportionality may be understood on the basis of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dress ] ) combined with the fact that the equilibrium anisotropy does not change to _ first _ order in @xmath162 ( because @xmath14-linear terms vanish after summing over all momenta ) .",
    "in this work we have presented a theory of the current - induced spin torques in uniform ferromagnets .",
    "the torques can be viewed as due to a difference between the magnetic anisotropy energy of a ferromagnet which carries no current and the magnetic anisotropy of a ferromagnet in the transport steady state , which give rise to a corresponding change in anisotropy effective magnetic fields .",
    "when the transport steady state is described using a relaxation time approximation , the current - induced contribution to the anisotropy field of a strongly metallic ferromagnet is given in energy units by @xmath163_{a , a}{\\bf v}_{a , a}\\cdot{\\bf e } \\ , \\frac{\\partial f_{{\\bf k},a}}{\\partial\\epsilon_{{\\bf k},a } } \\ , \\tau_{{\\bf k},a}.\\ ] ] where @xmath164_{a , a}$ ] is the spin - density weighted average of the exchange splitting of a particular state .",
    "we refer to the existence of this current - induced anisotropy field as the ferromagnetic inverse spin - galvanic effect .    in bulk materials",
    "this current induced field is non - zero only in gyrotropic ferromagnets , _",
    "i.e. _ only in ferromagnets that have broken inversion symmetry and are chiral .",
    "although uniform ferromagnetism may appear to be incompatible with broken inversion symmetry because of the the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , the equilibrium magnetic anisotropy is often strong enough ( or at least can be engineered so that it is strong enough ) to prevent the formation of spiral magnetic states .",
    "as an illustration of our theory , we have estimated current induced torques in uniform ( ga , mn)as , which is not gyrotropic when it has pseudo - cubic symmetry but becomes gyrotropic when strained . since substrate - dependent strains are present in all ( ga , mn)as thin films , the strength of the ferromagnetic isge is expected to be strongly sample - dependent .",
    "we have concluded that it should _ a priori _ be feasible to design ( ga , mn)as samples in which it is possible to switch the magnetization purely by electrical means . for typical sample parameters the necessary switching currents are on the order of @xmath165 , but",
    "the value may be tuned by adjusting the doping concentration and the axial strain . at these critical currents",
    "the joule heating is not negligible ; however , it is possible that further studies exploring the entire parameter space of mn concentration , hole density , and the axial strain will identify circumstances under which the critical currents are smaller .",
    "another possible avenue for further research consists of evaluating the anisotropy fields which can be generated by electrical currents in strain engineered samples of appropriate technologically useful ferromagnets . since we are not aware of room - temperature transition metal ferromagnets that are gyrotropic,@xcite we propose arranging a room - temperature , non - gyrotropic ferromagnet ( e.g. permalloy ) in contact with a non - magnetic , gyrotropic material ( e.g. strained gaas ) . in these artificial heterostructures room - temperature magnetism and gyrotropic symmetry",
    "would coexist by virtue of the proximity effect .",
    "finally , effects similar to those studied in this work would allow transport currents to change spiral states , and possibly to induce or remove them .",
