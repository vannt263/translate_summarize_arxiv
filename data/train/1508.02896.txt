    "the extensive efforts over the years to reconcile thermodynamics with quantum mechanics  @xcite have not yet fully resolved the fundamental question : what is truly quantum about quantum thermodynamics ?",
    "is there more to it than just restating traditional thermodynamic principles for quantized systems ?",
    "attempts to cope with this problem have revolved around possible quantum resources that may boost the thermodynamic performance of heat machines as compared to their classical counterparts .",
    "a prime contender for such a resource is quantum coherence  @xcite .",
    "intriguing schemes have predicted power and/or efficiency increase in quantum heat engines  @xcite due to sustainable ( steady - state ) coherence in non - thermal baths , as well as coherence - enhanced performance of photovoltaic solar heat converters  @xcite or coherent effects in photosynthesis  @xcite . according to an interesting view  @xcite , coherence in thermodynamics acts as an information reservoir or maxwell s demon , i.e. , as an extra resource that can tip the entropy balance and the division of input energy between heat and work in favor of the latter  @xcite .",
    "here we explore the thermodynamics of multilevel systems with excited - state degeneracy , which is a prerequisite for the persistence of interlevel quantum coherence in steady state imposed by _ thermal baths _",
    "our goal is to address the question : to what extent is coherence an asset when such systems are employed as working media in heat machines ?",
    "we show that the bounds on the efficiency and power output in the presence of coherence are general and common to all cycles , i.e. , reciprocating cycles that consist of consecutive strokes and continuous cycles .",
    "similar thermodynamic performance bounds are shared by multilevel systems whose excited states are degenerate and transition dipoles are perfectly aligned , and by multipartite dicke systems  @xcite .",
    "these general considerations ( sec .  [ sec_h_sb ] ) are followed ( secs .",
    "[ sec_system][sec_ss ] ) by a study of a quantum heat machine containing a working medium that has @xmath1 degenerate upper levels , whose transition dipoles to the ground state may not all be aligned .",
    "the system is constantly coupled to two spectrally distinct , hot and cold , thermal baths and is periodically modulated ( stark - shifted ) by an external field .",
    "this modulation acts as a piston in the heat machine  @xcite .",
    "our objective is to study the steady - state operation of such a heat machine , i.e. , the limit cycle of its dissipative evolution , by deriving its heat currents , power , and efficiency in the ususal regime of weak system - bath coupling  @xcite ( sec .",
    "[ sec_heat_currents ] ) .",
    "the present theory extends our previous study of heat machines whose working medium is a periodically modulated two - level system ( tls ) that is continuously coupled to two ( hot and cold ) baths  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the merit of such models is that they are amenable to a full quantum - mechanical analysis by the floquet method  @xcite .",
    "moreover , their continuous - cycle operation avoids the difficulty of ensuring compatibility with the laws of thermodynamics , in contrast to machines that are operated via reciprocating cycles that consist of four strokes ( e.g. , the carnot- or the otto cycle ) , where , alternately , only a hot or a cold bath is coupled to the working medium at any time  @xcite .",
    "the difficulty therein is to properly account for the highly nonadiabatic energy and entropy flows induced by frequent on- and off - switching of interactions with alternate heat baths in consecutive strokes .",
    "by contrast , continuous - cycle , periodically - driven , heat machines can in a straightforward manner be made compatible with the first and second laws of thermodynamics regardless of their nonadiabaticity  @xcite .",
    "steady - state coherences between upper levels are shown here to arise as a consequence of the thermalization of the initial state under the condition of strict transition - dipole alignment .",
    "however , thermalization may then be partially blocked , i.e. , be incomplete , by the mere presence of dark states .",
    "for this reason we introduce the notion of _ thermalization capability _ of the initial state . we show that this capability should be maximized , by avoiding the initial population of dark states , in order to cause maximal power enhancement by the multilevel heat machine , as compared to its two - level counterpart .",
    "we argue that it is the thermalization capability rather than steady - state coherence that underlies the power - enhancement mechanism : the key resource of the multilevel heat machine is the thermalization of transitions that share a _",
    "common _ ground state , and are thereby correlated , whether coherently or incoherently .",
    "similar principles govern heat machines based on a multiatom dicke system , notwithstanding their different dynamics ( sec .",
    "[ sec_dicke ] ) .",
    "the heat currents and the power are analytically shown ( secs .",
    "[ sec_heat_currents ] and  [ sec_dicke ] ) to be both strongly boosted by the same enhancement factor with respect to a single two - level system .",

    "energy can flow from and to the baths via absorption and ( stimulated and spontaneous ) emission , respectively , of thermal bath quanta .",
    "the system - bath interaction hamiltonian is assumed to be of a generalized dipole - coupling form  @xcite that is expressed in the rotating - wave approximation as  @xcite @xmath6 in terms of the excitation and de - excitation pauli operators    [ eq_splus ] @xmath7    the ( possibly complex ) dipole moments for the @xmath8th transition @xmath9 , and the coupling operators of the cold ( hot ) heat bath @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "we adopt the notation @xmath12 where the strength of the largest transition dipole @xmath13 serves as reference ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) .",
    "we further define the dipole alignment matrix @xmath15 where @xmath16 $ ] , which encodes the directional configuration of the @xmath1 dipoles .",

    "what follows we will for brevity denote dipoles @xmath19 and @xmath9 with @xmath20 as being parallel even if they differ by a phase ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "prior to discussing in detail a possible setup of such a heat machine , we infer from the system - bath interaction hamiltonian   some general results concerning the thermodynamic rle of coherences in the working medium .      owing to the degeneracy of the excited states of the system hamiltonian @xmath22",
    "one is free to choose any ( rotated ) basis within this excited manifold , as the rotated states will still be energy eigenstates of the hamiltonian  .",
    "assuming that all dipoles are parallel and ( for simplicity ) of equal strength and real , we then transform the system - bath hamiltonian   to the basis consisting of the ground state @xmath4 , the collective `` bright '' state  @xcite @xmath23 and @xmath24 rotated excited states that are orthogonal to the latter .",
    "the system - bath interaction hamiltonian   then adopts the form @xmath25 formally , this hamiltonian describes a _ single two - level system _ formed by @xmath4 and @xmath26 , whose interaction with the baths has a dipole moment _ enhanced _ by a factor of @xmath27 , which is responsible for superradiance  @xcite .",
    "the remaining @xmath24 states , which are orthogonal to @xmath4 and @xmath26 , are not accessible by this hamiltonian : they are _ dark states _ with respect to the ( dipolar ) system - bath interaction .",
    "consequently , if the @xmath0-level system with parallel dipoles is initially prepared in one of these dark states , it does not exchange heat with the baths , and its state remains invariant under the action of the system - bath interaction hamiltonian .",
    "we therefore anticipate the result ( elaborated further on ) , that the steady - state solution for parallel dipoles strongly depends on the overlap of the initial state @xmath28 with these dark states , i.e. , on the initial value @xmath29 of the dark - state projector .",
    "if , however , the initial state of the multilevel system is non - dark , then the rate of quanta exchange of the _ effective _ tls ( formed by @xmath26 and @xmath4 ) with the baths , @xmath30 , is enhanced by a factor of @xmath1 compared to the spontaneous - emission rate @xmath31 of a tls consisting of the states @xmath4 and @xmath32 .",
    "this can be deduced from the ( dissipative ) master - equation description for the reduced density matrix of the system , based on the interaction hamiltonian  : the spontaneous - emission ( decay ) rate scales with the square of the transition - dipole moment  @xcite and therefore @xmath33 with @xmath34 ( sec .",
    "[ subsec_parallel ] ) .",
    "let us consider the implications of the collective enhancement for the heat currents , i.e. , the rate of energy exchange between the system and the baths , and the power of the heat machine .",
    "the heat currents must be proportional to the rate of quanta absorption and emission of quanta from and to the baths , respectively  @xcite .",
    "this proportionality should be independent of the actual implementation of the heat machine , i.e. , whether both baths are continuously coupled to the system or only one at a time in a reciprocating cycle .    due to the enhancement of the decay rate for parallel dipoles in a bright state , the `` cold '' ( @xmath35 ) and the `` hot '' ( @xmath36 ) heat currents",
    "@xmath37 , @xmath38 being the heat exchange with the @xmath39th bath , will be equally enhanced compared to their two - level counterparts , as    [ eq_introduction_currents_tls ] @xmath40    the first law of thermodynamics ( energy conservation )  @xcite then implies that the power is enhanced by the same factor , @xmath41 equations   and   imply that although an enhancement of the output power is expected , the efficiency of the multilevel heat engine , which is defined by the ratio of the extracted power to the invested `` hot '' current  @xcite , @xmath42 remains the _ same _ as for a tls - based heat engine where coherence is absent .",
    "notably , the carnot bound  @xcite is adhered to , by virtue of eq .  , eq .   and",
    "the second - law condition  @xcite @xmath43    the assumptions in the foregoing discussion were the degeneracy of the excited states as well as the dipolar - coupling form of @xmath44 between the system and both thermal baths .",
    "any increase of the efficiency compared to eq",
    ".   would require different enhancement of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , such that the enhancement @xmath45 of the `` hot '' current @xmath46 exceeds its `` cold '' current counterpart @xmath47 , i.e. , @xmath48 .",
    "this may only be possible for different coupling hamiltonians between the system and the two thermal baths , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , unlike eq .  .",
    "however , the carnot bound , which is a corollary of the first and second laws  @xcite , is upheld regardless of these assumptions since even if such enhancement can be achieved , the second law restricts the ratio of the current enhancement factors @xmath47 and @xmath45 to satisfy [ cf .",
    "@xmath51      if all dipoles are parallel , coherences in the working fluid ( medium ) will build up in the bare ( energy ) basis according to the hamiltonian   once the system is in contact with heat baths at finite temperature , since the bright state @xmath26 [ see eq .  ]",
    "is a coherent superposition of the bare excited states .",
    "_ initial _ coherences may either suppress or enhance the machine performance : they can bring the heat machine to a complete standstill if they correspond to the set of dark states @xmath52 since the hamiltonian   then yields @xmath53 , so that the system is then decoupled from the baths .",
    "conversely , the hamiltonian   will enhance both the heat currents and the power by a factor of @xmath1 due to the superradiant ( collective - decay ) effect if either @xmath26 or the ground state @xmath4 is initially prepared . yet , even if the system has initially no coherence , it will evolve via the hamiltonian   to a thermal mixture of @xmath4 and @xmath26 that has persistent coherences .",
    "thus , steady - state coherences ( embodied by the bright state ) are formed in the bare energy basis as a result of thermalization , but the entire system does not thermalize , i.e. , an @xmath0-level gibbs state does not arise because of the availability of dark states ( even if they are not populated ) ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec_parallel ] ) .",
    "the foregoing discussion of the thermodynamic rle of coherences in the working medium holds for the special case of all transition - dipole vectors in the hamiltonian   being parallel . in what follows ,",
    "we , however , wish to explore the possibility of power enhancement for misaligned ( non - parallel ) dipoles , or any combination of aligned and misaligned dipoles .",
    "since steady - state coherences correspond to ( destructive or constructive ) interference of the dipoles , they can only arise if at least some of the dipoles are aligned .",
    "only then may dark states exist . without the presence of such dark states , a thermal ( gibbs ) steady state of the working fluid",
    "is expected .    as we show in sec .",
    "[ sec_dicke ] , these arguments also hold for an ensemble of @xmath0 two - level atoms in a suitable geometry , which realizes the dicke model  @xcite ( sec .  [ sec_multiatom_realization ] ) . in that case",
    "the effective system - bath interaction hamiltonian can not be written in the form of eq .  .",
    "instead , the ensemble can then be mapped onto a collective spin-@xmath54 system and a multitude of dark states .",
    "the heat currents will no longer adhere to a simple form as in eqs .  ,",
    "but the efficiency of the dicke heat machine will still be the same as of the tls - based machine .",
    "in the remainder of this article these issues are investigated for a continuous - cycle heat machine , wherein the ( @xmath1)-fold degenerate system is constantly coupled to the two thermal baths and to a periodically modulating `` piston '' that allows for work extraction ( in the case of an engine ) or supply ( in the case of a refrigerator or heat pump ) , respectively ( see fig .

    "the remedy is to realize the dicke model in field - confining structures such as photonic bandgap structures  @xcite , cavities  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , and waveguides  @xcite .     next to or within one - dimensional waveguides .",
    "see text for details . ]    in particular , consider the realistic setup ( fig .",

    "alternatively , we may employ a chain of superconducting qubits coupled to a microwave coplanar waveguide  @xcite .",
    "field confinement can give rise to a giantly enhanced density of modes at the lower cutoff frequency of the waveguide  @xcite .",

    "these are temperatures of the order of @xmath284k .",
    "by contrast , for microwave transitions ( @xmath285hz ) the high - temperature regime is already realized at @xmath286k .",
    "the present analysis sheds new light on multilevel or multipartite heat machines and their degeneracy as a thermodynamic resource that can boost the heat currents and the power output of heat engines .",
    "by contrast , the efficiency of such machines was shown to be unaltered compared to a tls - based machine , which adheres to the carnot bound .",
    "we can summarize our findings regarding the rle of initial and steady - state coherences in the power enhancement of degenerate steady - state multilevel quantum heat engines as follows ,    1 .",
    "_ steady - state coherences are a consequence of thermalization if at least two transition dipoles are parallel .",

    "2 .   _ neither initial nor steady - state coherences do necessarily imply power enhancement compared to a single tls and , vice versa , power enhancement does not always entail initial or steady - state coherences . _",
    "the relevant factor for power enhancement is the thermalization capability ( sec .",
    "[ subsec_parallel ] ) of the initial state , not the amount of steady - state coherence . as an extreme example , even if all three dipoles of a four - level system are perpendicular to each other ( the largest orthogonal system possible in three - dimensional space ) the power is enhanced  without coherence between the excited states at any time and regardless of the initial condition .",
    "the decisive ingredient is the _ common ground state _ of the dipole transitions .",
    "it is generally true that aligned dipole configurations yield higher power boost than non - aligned ones in the high - temperature limit  if the initial state is properly chosen .",
    "even then , we may not attribute this power boost ( compared to non - aligned configurations ) to steady - state coherences but rather to the presence of dark states , which reduce the number of available levels amenable to thermalization .",
    "the key factor for enhancement is the _ ground - state population _ of this reduced @xmath161-level system .",
    "the fewer levels can thermalize , the more is the ground state thermally populated . yet , any population in the ground state necessarily _ decreases _ the maximally permitted coherences within the excited - states manifold .",
    "power reduction implies the existence of steady - state coherences .",
    "_ power reduction is associated with dark states being initially populated .",
    "the largest possible steady - state coherences correspond to fully excited ( population - inverted ) states , which can only occur if the initial state is dark .",
    "overall , we found that an @xmath0-level heat machine can not yield higher power than @xmath1 independent two - level heat machines .",
    "whilst at low - temperatures both machines perform equally well , the power enhancement in the @xmath0-level machine decreases at higher temperatures , unless all dipoles are parallel . taking advantage of the full cooperativity of the excited states ( occurring only for parallel transition dipoles ) , however , requires carefully chosen ( non - dark ) initial conditions ( sec .

    "nevertheless , doubling the power output of a heat machine by cooperative effects will be an important achievement .    to conclude , our findings elucidate the possible impact of steady - state coherence or entanglement in the working medium on the performance of heat machines .",

    "the possibility of exceeding the carnot bound by virtue of harnessing _ non - thermal _ baths in the heat machine , including baths consisting of coherently - superposed  @xcite or superradiant  @xcite atomic systems , as well as squeezed baths  @xcite is outside the scope of the present discussion , and so are effects related to piston quantization  @xcite or to strong system - bath coupling  @xcite that require further clarification . notwithstanding these open issues ,",
