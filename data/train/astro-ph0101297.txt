    "the importance of understanding the nature of the recently - discovered sub - mm galaxy population has been discussed in detail by many authors ( e.g. hughes et al .",
    "1998 ; blain et al .",
    "most importantly , constraining the redshift distribution of this population is a requirement for obtaining an unbiased view of the star - formation history of the universe , and potentially holds the key to understanding the formation and evolution of massive elliptical galaxies ( e.g. eales et al .",
    "2000 ; dunlop 2001 ) . in this review",
    "i therefore concentrate on what we have learned to date about the redshift distribution of the sub - mm population from the six main classes of survey which researchers have undertaken in the last 2 - 3 years with the scuba camera on the jcmt .",
    "first i consider current results from three different types of surveys aimed at determining the sub - mm luminosities of objects which have already been discovered at other wavelengths . these are i ) radio galaxies , ii ) optically selected quasars , and iii ) micro - jy radio sources .",
    "such studies have the practical advantage of accurate source positions , and ( at least in the first 2 cases ) pre - existing redshift information . by focussing on specific sub - classes of object they are inevitably biased to some extent , but the extent of this bias may not necessarily be severe .",
    "second , i consider current results from surveys which have been designed to discover new sources at sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "again , i have divided these into three distinct classes , namely i ) surveys which aim to take advantage of the gravitational lensing effects of intervening rich clusters , ii ) imaging surveys of the fields around known high - redshift objects , and iii ) genuinely unbiased , blank - field surveys of non - descript regions of sky .    for the sake of clarity and comparability",
    "i have produced summary statistics for each survey considering only sources which have been detected in the sub - mm at significance levels @xmath6 , and which have intrinsic sub - mm flux densities @xmath7mjy .    before proceeding with this census ,",
    "it is important to note that , apart from the radio galaxies and quasars for which spectroscopic redshifts already exist , almost all of the redshift estimates discussed and summarized in what follows are based on the observed far - infrared@xmath8radio spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the sources .",
    "this serves to emphasize the importance of understanding such seds , and legitimizes the inclusion of this review in this particular conference !",
    "however it does of course mean that many of the current redshift constraints are inevitably rather crude and uncertain .    of greatest current importance",
    "is the use of the sub - mm : radio flux - density ratio @xmath9 which is a relatively sensitive function of redshift for a starburst galaxy , initially rising @xmath10 before flattening towards higher redshift in a manner which depends on the form of the assumed template spectrum .",
    "this ratio was first used by hughes et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to set redshift constraints on the sub - mm sources detected in the hubble deep field , and has since been explored in detail by carilli & yun ( 1999 ) , carrilli & yun ( 2000 ) , dunne et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , barger et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and blain ( 2001 ) .",
    "there is now general agreement that adopting m82 as a template sed ( e.g. carilli & yun 1999 ) is probably _ not _ appropriate for the luminous sub - mm population and is likely to lead to excessive redshift estimates .",
    "instead , most authors now adopt arp220 as the most appropriate low - redshift template ulirg .",
    "alternatively , dunne et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have chosen to derive a mean - sed from their scuba survey of low - redshift iras galaxies .",
    "there is some continuing controversy over the precise form of the best relation to use .",
    "dunne et al . ( 2000 ) argue convincingly that their relation is most robustly calibrated at low redshift . on the other hand the revised relation presented by carilli & yun ( 2000 ) appears to do a better job of reproducing the redshifts of the handful of objects with known co redshifts at @xmath11 . however , the level of this disagreement is now comparable to the uncertainties in these relations , and the key point in what follows is that essentially all authors in this field would appear to agree that a flux - density ratio @xmath12 ( or equivalently a spectral index @xmath13 ) implies @xmath11 .",
    "finally , when utilising this redshift - estimation technique , it is always worth remembering that over - optimistic radio - submm associations , or failure to recognize an agn contribution to radio flux - density , will always result in an _ under - estimate _ of the true redshift of the source . over - estimation of redshift is less likely to occur .",
    "the first radio galaxies to be detected at sub - mm / mm wavelengths were also the most distant and powerful radio galaxies known at the time - 4c41.17 at z = 3.8 ( dunlop et al .",
    "1994 ) and 8c1435@xmath14635 at z = 4.2 ( ivison et al . 1995 ) . even before scuba it was clear that these @xmath15 detections were telling us something important because attempts to detect other well - known radio galaxies at lower redshift were much less successful ( hughes et al .",
    "1997 ) . however , it was only with the advent of scuba that it became possible to observe sufficiently large samples of radio galaxies to determine if the large dust masses found in 4c41.17 and 8c1435@xmath14635 ( figure 1 ) are primarily a consequence of their extreme redshifts or their extreme radio luminosities .",
    "my colleages and i have now completed the first such major sub - mm survey of radio galaxies , using scuba in photometry mode to undertake sensitive 850-micron observations ( rms noise @xmath16 mjy ) of @xmath0 powerful radio galaxies spanning the redshift range @xmath17 ( archibald et al . 2000 ) . as shown in figure 2 , this study has confirmed the increased sub - mm detectability of radio galaxies with increasing redshift ( 15% success rate at @xmath18 , 75% success rate at @xmath19 ) .",
    "moreover , we have been able to break the degeneracy between radio luminosity and redshift , and find that the primary dependence of sub - mm luminosity is with redshift - specifically we find that average sub - mm luminosity increases approximately @xmath20 out to @xmath15 .",
    "the median redshift of the sub - mm detected radio galaxies in this sample is @xmath21 .",
    "it is important to stress that this is not simply a reflection of the redshift distribution of the parent sample , as this has @xmath22 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "interestingly , all but one of the radio galaxies with @xmath23mjy lie at @xmath24 , and the median redshift for this subset is @xmath25 . + * redshift summary : * median @xmath26 .",
    "1/9 4@xmath27 @xmath7mjy sources at @xmath2 . + * bias : * potentially unbiassed if radio galaxies are representative of massive galaxies in general .",
    "+      a substantial number of high - redshift ( @xmath15 ) optically - selected quasars have now been detected at sub - mm ( mcmahon et al . 1999 ) and mm ( carilli et al . 2000 ) wavelengths .",
    "however , to date such observations have been deliberately concentrated on very high - redshift quasars , and no study has yet been completed of the sub - mm luminosity of qsos of comparable optical luminosity over a wide range in redshift , analogous to that described above for radio galaxies . as a result",
    "it is not yet possible to quantify the redshift dependence of dust mass in quasars .",
    "however , mcmahon et al . ( 1999 ) have explored whether , at high redshift , there is any evidence that sub - mm luminosity depends on optical luminosity and do not find any support for such a luminosity dependence . + * redshift summary : * median @xmath28 .",
    "0/9 sources at @xmath2 . + * bias : * biassed - bias potentially severe and not yet quantified .",
    "+      barger et al . ( 2000 ) have found that a substantial fraction ( @xmath29 ) of optically - faint micro - jy radio sources can be detected by scuba at flux densities @xmath30mjy .",
    "this is an important , albeit not entirely unexpected , result as both synchrotron emission from type ii supernovae and thermal emission from warm dust are symptomatic of very recent ( @xmath31yr ) massive star - formation activity .",
    "barger et al .",
    "conclude that @xmath32% of the bright sub - mm population can be located via micro - jy radio maps , and that the entire sub - mm population lies in the redshift band @xmath33 .",
    "however , a closer examination of their data suggests that this conclusion may be premature .",
    "in fact , of the 4 sub - mm sources they have discovered with @xmath34mjy , only two are @xmath35jy radio sources , and the listed radio - submm sed - based redshift estimates for these 4 sources are @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this ` survey ' thus arguably supports a mean / median redshift of @xmath3 for the bright sub - mm population , albeit with very large errors .",
    "in fact , even at somewhat lower sub - mm flux densities , examination of their figure 2 suggests that @xmath35jy radio - source selection can only identify @xmath0% of the scuba population , especially when one factors in the inevitable bias introduced by imaging only sub areas which contain the majority of faint radio sources .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0% of the scuba population which can be detected by this approach must , inevitably , be the lower - redshift half .",
    "wide area blank - field surveys , such as the 8-mjy survey described below , offer the only way to properly quantify this bias . + * redshift summary : * median @xmath40  1/4 sources at @xmath2 . +",
    "* bias : * biased to lower-@xmath41 sources , but extent of bias not yet properly quantified . +",
    "i now consider our current information on the redshifts of sources which have been _ discovered _ through sub - mm imaging .",
    "such sources have been uncovered via three different classes of sub - mm survey , namely i ) surveys designed to take advantage of the gravitational lensing provided by rich galaxy clusters , ii ) surveys of the fields around known high - redshift agn , and iii ) unbiassed blank - field surveys , generally conducted in regions of sky which have already been well - studied at other wavelengths .",
    "below i give a summary of the main results from each class of survey .",
    "i have deliberately focussed attention on the brightest sources , because it is generally only for these sources that solid , unconfused sub - mm / mm positional information has been obtained so far .",
    "the ultimate goal of spectroscopic redshifts , confirmed by co detections , has been achieved for three of the sources detected via scuba imaging of the fields of rich clusters ",
    "smmj02399@xmath420136 at @xmath43 , smmj14011 + 0252 at @xmath44 , and smmj02399@xmath420134 at @xmath45 ( smail et al .",
    "however , while it is obviously nice to have some concrete numbers , it is unclear how representative these sources are , given that their redshift determination was assisted by their unusually bright optical counterparts and , in the latter two cases , by the presence of an agn . for the sample as a whole one has to resort to the radio - submm redshift estimator discussed above .",
    "based on the fact that only @xmath46 of the sample has proved detectable at 1.4ghz , smail et al .",
    "( 2000 ) argue that the median redshift is most likely @xmath47 .",
    "this result provides direct support for the argument advanced above ( in section 2.3 ) that targeted sub - mm observations of known micro - jy radio sources are likely to reveal only the low - redshift half of the sub - mm galaxy population .",
    "it also means that the median redshift of the lensing - survey sources is in excellent accord with the median redshift of sub - mm detected radio galaxies discussed in section 2.1 . + * redshift summary : * median @xmath48 .",
    "2/7 sources at @xmath2 . + * bias : * unbiased .",
    "sub - mm surveys of the fields around known high - redshift objects are , by definition , inevitably biassed to some extent . however , given the probability that galaxy formation at high redshift is itself biassed towards regions of high density , such targeted imaging surveys are a potentially important complement to genuinely unbiassed blank - field surveys .",
    "indeed the first few deep scuba images of the fields around high - redshift radio galaxies have proved remarkably successful at uncovering bright sub - mm sources , as illustrated in figure 3 .",
    "deep radio imaging in the vicinity of such powerful radio sources is obviously challenging , but is underway at the time of writing .",
    "however , existing 450:850 ratios , and the faintness of possible optical / ir identifications already support the statistically - probable conclusion that these sources lie at the same redshift as the central agn . moreover , direct confirmation of this has recently been obtained for one source via co imaging ( ivison 2001 ) .",
    "the best estimate of the yield of this work to date is 8 sources with @xmath30mjy  3 at @xmath49 , 2 at @xmath50 and 3 at @xmath51 . + * redshift summary : * median @xmath49 .",
    "0/8 sources at @xmath2 . + * bias : * biassed - imaging largely confined to objects at @xmath24 .        at the time of writing none of the sub - mm sources in the hubble deep field reported by hughes et al .",
    "( 1998 ) has a reliable redshift .",
    "given the wealth of supporting data this serves to demonstrate how hard it will be to obtain complete redshift information on sub - mm selected samples .",
    "interesting constraints can , however , be placed on the redshift of the brightest source hdf850.1 ( @xmath52mjy ) , following its detection with the iram pdb interferometer at 1.3 mm ( downes et al .",
    "while the accurate position provided by the interferometric detection has not in fact yielded an unambiguous optical identification , it has enabled a robust upper limit to be placed on the 1.4ghz:850@xmath53 flux - density ratio of @xmath54 .",
    "this , along with the 450:850 and 850:1300 ratios all point to a redshift in the range @xmath55 ( see figures 4 and 5 ) , in which case it is certainly possible that its optical / ir counterpart is too faint to be detected by existing optical / ir imaging .",

    "0/2 sources at @xmath2 . + * bias : * unbiassed , but sample very small .",
    "+      the recent completion of the 14-hr field of the canada - uk scuba survey has yielded 7 sources with signal : noise @xmath57 and @xmath7 mjy ( eales et al . 2000 ) .",
    "of particular interest is the brightest source ( cudss 14.1 ; @xmath58 mjy ) which , like hdf850.1 has now been detected with the the iram pdb interferometer at 1.3 mm ( gear et al .",
    "again radio - mm - submm sed constraints favour a high redshift in the range @xmath59 ; eales et al .",
    "choose an estimated redshift of @xmath60 .",
    "most of the other 4-@xmath27 sources in this sample have not been detected at 1.4ghz , but their relatively weak sub - mm fluxes means the resulting redshift constraint is generally simply @xmath11 .",

    "very deep radio data will not be available for these fields until early in 2001 , and so at present it is not possible to place even crude constraints on the redshifts of most of these sources .",
    "however , the brightest source in the lockman field has been detected by the iram pdb interferometer , and in this case identified with a faint red complex object via very - deep @xmath62-band imaging .",

    "it is interesting that of the @xmath0 significant extragalactic sources with @xmath7mjy uncovered by scuba during its first 2 - 3 years of operation , only @xmath63% appear to lie at @xmath2 .",
    "certainly , all of these studies can be reconciled with a median redshift of at least @xmath64 for the luminous sub - mm galaxy population .",
