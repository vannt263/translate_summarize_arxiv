    "in field theory , it is important to understand the property of the symmetry of the lagrangian density . in the standard model ,",
    "the time reversal invariance is normally kept , but due to the phase of kobayashi - maskawa mixing matrix , there is the t - violation term present in the lagrangian density .",
    "the phase shows up as the cp violation effects on the @xmath0 mixing in the kaon decay processes @xcite . since the cp violation of the kaon decay experiment determines the kobayashi - maskawa phase , it should be interesting to see what should be further physical observables which are predicted from the cp violation phenomena or t - violating observables .",
    "recent experiments on the cp violation of the @xmath1 mixing in the b - meson decay processes suggest that the phase of kobayashi - maskawa mixing matrix may not be able to describe the observed mixing angle from the @xmath1 mixing .",
    "this suggests that there may be some other terms present in the lagrangian density , which violates the t - invariance .",
    "the direct measurement of the t - violation effects can be examined if one can measure the electric dipole moments ( edm ) of the isolated system .",
    "the finite number of the neutron edm should exhibit most clearly the direct evidence of the t - violation effects in the lagrangian density . until now ,",
    "the upper limit of the neutron edm @xmath2 from the direct measurements is around @xcite @xmath3 @xmath4 this edm is still not finite , but gives a strong constraint on the supersymmetry model parameters .",
    "there are also edm measurements of atomic systems such as @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite",
    ". however , it is not very easy to extract the individual particles edm from the atomic edm measurements since there is the schiff theorem @xcite .",
    "the schiff theorem states that the edm of the individual particles can not be measured if the constituents are interacting with nonrelativistic static coulomb force .",
    "the edm of the individual particles should show up when they are interacting with relativistic kinematics @xcite or with strong interactions @xcite .",
    "the edm due to the former case is found in the heavy atomic system while the edm of the latter case arises from the finite nuclear size effects .",
    "recent careful studies clarify @xcite that the edm arising from the nuclear finite size effects is directly related to the neutron edm @xmath2 as @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the edms of xe and hg atomic systems . in particular ,",
    "the edm of @xmath11hg atomic system is observed with high accuracy and from the observed vaule of @xmath10 , we can deduce the neutron edm as @xmath12 this number is three orders of magnitude smaller than the direct measurement of neutron edm in eq.(1.1 ) .",
    "therefore , it should be worthwhile to examine how this number of the neutron edm can give constraints on the supersymmetry model parameters .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most promising candidates for new physics beyond the standard model @xcite . in particular",
    ", supersymmetric models contain new cp - violating phases @xcite in addition to the phase of the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa mixing matrix , and the effect of these phases may explain the discrepancy between the experimental result and the standard model prediction for cp - asymmetry in the b - meson decays . in general ,",
    "the new cp - violating phases in supersymmetric models induce a non - vanishing edm for quarks and leptons .",
    "in fact , they give a large contribution to the edms at the one - loop level . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that the standard model contributions to the edms cancel out up to the two - loop level , and the leading three - loop contribution is much smaller than the current experimental upper bound .",
    "this implies that a large edm is not only a signal of cp - violation but also an indirect evidence of susy .",
    "in the present work , we calculate the edm of neutron , proton and electron in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with cp - violating phases",
    ". we shall show that the neutron edm limit in eq.(1.3 ) gives a very severe constraint on the parameters in the supersymmetric model . for a sizable value of the cp - violating phases , the magnitude of soft breaking mass parameters typically has to be larger than several tev to satisfy the edm constraint .",
    "further , we show , for the first time , that the proton edm can be extracted from the nitrogen and thallium atomic edm .",
    "this is simply because , for the @xmath13 case , it has the ground state with spin @xmath14 , and the state is described by the proton hole state as @xmath15 to a good accuracy . also , for the @xmath16 case , since it is a single proton hole state , it can be expressed as @xmath17 to a good approximation even though the neutrons are not in the magic but in the two hole state .    from the experimental constraint , the nucleus should have the spin @xmath14 such that the quadrupole field should not have any effects on the edm measurements . in this respect",
    ", @xmath18 and @xmath16 atomic systems must be good cases for measuring the nuclear edm .",
    "the edm of the nitrogen atomic system @xmath19 and the @xmath16 atomic system @xmath20 are related to the proton edm @xmath21 , and the calculated numbers become @xmath22 @xmath23    recently , regan et.al have measured the atomic edm of @xmath16 by the atomic beam magnetic resonance method @xcite . from the measurement of the atomic edm of @xmath16 , we can extract the proton edm @xmath21 @xmath24 which is quite a severe constraint on the proton edm @xmath21 .",
    "here , we have not included the electron edm contribution to the atomic edm of @xmath16 , and the electron edm contribution will be discussed in a qualitative manner in section 4 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the edm for the nitrogen case is smaller than the ones in heavier nuclei , but we believe that the nitrogen edm should be also measured in future .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we briefly discuss the new mechanism to obtain the edm of the individual particles in nucleus , like neutron edm or proton edm from atomic systems .",
    "then , in section 3 , we evaluate the edm of neutron , proton and electron in the minimal supersymmetric standard model with cp - violating phases , and find various constraints on the supersymmetric parameters from the observed neutron edm value . in section 4 , we present a qualitative discussion on the contributions of the electron and the proton edms to the atomic edm value .",
    "section 5 summarizes what we clarify the nuclear edm and the related parameters which appear in the supersymmetry models .",
    "the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the isolated system can present a direct evidence of the t - violation interaction if it is finite .",
    "since the measurement is carried out for the total atomic system , the edm of the individual particles ( electron edm or nucleon edm ) should be extracted from the atomic edm measurement . however , this extraction is a nontrivial task since there is the schiff theorem .",
    "the schiff theorem states that the edm of the individual particles can not be measured if the neutral system is interacting with nonrelativistic electrostatic forces .",
    "the edm of electron becomes important when the system has a relativistic effect since the schiff theorem is not applicable to the relativistic case . indeed for heavier atoms , the relativistic effect becomes important since the relativistic correction is seen as @xmath25 . for the electron edm",
    ", there are many calculations in heavy atoms .",
    "if the interactions are due to nuclear forces , then there is no effect from the schiff theorem .",
    "since the nucleus is always found in atomic system , the nuclear edm can be seen as the finite size effects in the total atomic system .",
    "recent calculations on the nuclear edm show that there is an appreciably large effect of the nuclear edm to the total atomic edm after the effects due to the schiff theorem are taken into account .",
    "the results obtained in @xcite for xe and hg atomic edm are summarized in eqs .",
    "( 1.2 ) .",
    "now , we briefly describe the finite size effects of the atomic edm since the detailed calculation is found in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the effects due to the schiff theorem are well treated and explained in @xcite , and therefore we do not repeat it for this part in this paper .",
    "we first write the hamiltonian of the total atomic and nuclear systems for nitrogen .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath26 of the nitrogen system can be written @xmath27 + { 1\\over 2}\\sum_{i\\not= j}^z{e^2\\over{|{\\bf r}_i-{\\bf r}_j| } } \\ ] ] @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 denote the coordinate and the momentum of the electron while @xmath31 , @xmath32 denote the nuclear variable and momentum , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , the perturbed hamiltonian coming from the edm is written as @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 where the summation over @xmath36 in nucleus means that it should be taken over protons .",
    "the edm of the nucleon can be expressed in terms of the nucleon isospin as @xmath37 .",
    "\\eqno{(2.3)}\\ ] ]      here , we evaluate the finite size effects on the second order edm energy in the nucleus .",
    "the perturbed edm hamiltonian for nuclear parts @xmath38 can be written as @xmath39    now , we consider the second order edm energy due to the intermediate nuclear excitations , keeping the atomic state in the ground state .",
    "this process arises from the finite nuclear size effects in the edm hamiltonian .",
    "the second order edm energy can be written as @xmath40 @xmath41\\ ] ] @xmath42 denote the ground state energy and the excitation energy of the nuclear states , respectively .",
    "the electron states are kept in the ground state throughout the calculation , and therefore it is not written here .",
    "also , it should be noted that we made use of the relation @xmath43 since we set the center mass coordinate to the nuclear center .",
    "now , we calculate the @xmath13 case in which we assume a simple single particle shell model state @xmath44 . this should be rather a good description for @xmath13 .",
    "further , the atomic states stay in the ground state , and therefore the electron wave functions are not written here .",
    "thus , we write the nuclear wave function as @xmath45 in this case , the intermediate states @xmath46 that contribute to the second order edm energy [ eq.(2.6 ) ] for @xmath47 are restricted to @xmath48 and obtain the relation between the nitrogen edm @xmath49 and the proton edm @xmath21 as @xmath50 even though the factor in front of @xmath21 is not very large number , we believe that the edm of nitrogen can be well measured experimentally in future .",
    "now , we calculate the @xmath16 case in which we assume a simple single particle shell model state @xmath51",
    ". this should be reasonable for the @xmath16 case .",
    "therefore , the nuclear wave function for @xmath16 can be written as @xmath52 in this case , the intermediate states @xmath46 that contribute to the second order edm energy [ eq.(2.6 ) ] for @xmath53 are restricted to @xmath54 and obtain the relation between the thallium edm @xmath55 and the proton edm @xmath21 as @xmath23 clearly , the edm of thallium is quite large , and therefore there must be a good chance of observing it . indeed , there is a measurement of t@xmath56f compound system , and cho el al .",
    "@xcite obtained the edm of @xmath57 as @xmath58 making use of the relation between thallium edm and proton edm [ eq.(1.4b ) ] , we obtain the proton edm as @xmath59 where we ignored the contribution of edm from the fluoride atomic system .",
    "further , regan et al .",
    "have recently measured the atomic edm of @xmath16 by the atomic beam magnetic resonance method @xcite .",
    "they extracted the electron edm from their measurement , and obtained the constraint of electron edm @xmath60 .",
    "here , we estimate the proton edm from their measurements , and the atomic edm of @xmath16 is found to be @xmath61 therefore , we can extract the proton edm using eq.(1.4b ) @xmath62 which gives stronger constraints than eq.(2.11 ) of cho et.al almost by two orders of magnitude .",
    "this proton value of @xmath21 is just comparable to the neutron edm @xmath2 from the direct measurement .    as mentioned above",
    ", the effects due to the electron edm @xmath60 in heavy atoms should be large .",
    "in fact the contribution of the electron edm to the thallium case is evaluated in @xcite , and they found a very large enhancement factor . in this paper , however , we have not included the electron edm .",
    "instead , we will discuss the electron edm contribution to the atomic edm in a qualitative fashion in section 4 .",
    "in this section , we discuss the constraints from the neutron edm in the mssm . in the present analysis , we work in a framework of a phenomenological mssm .",
    "the relevant parameters in this model are defined as follows .",
