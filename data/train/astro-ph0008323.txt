    "dwarf novae are a sub - class of the cataclysmic variable stars ( cvs ) , which show quasi - periodic outbursts ( for a review , see warner @xcite ) .",
    "suuma - type dwarf novae show two types of outbursts , namely normal outbursts , and so - called superoutbursts .",
    "normal outbursts ( typically 24 mag ) last 35 days , and superoutbursts ( 0.51.0 mag brighter than normal outbursts ) last about 34 times longer than normal outbursts . between two successive superoutbursts ,",
    "310 normal outbursts occur .",
    "this behavior is now well explained in the thermal - tidal disk instability model ( e.g. osaki @xcite ) : a normal outburst is caused by a thermal limit - cycle based on the strong dependence of the hydrogen opacity on the ionization state . in the accretion disk . when the disk has enough mass to extend itself radially to the critical tidal radius at the maximum of a normal outburst , efficient removal of angular momentum due to tidal stress induced by the secondary maintains the disk longer in the hot state ( superoutburst ) .",
    "the tidal effects force the accretion disk into a slowly precessing eccentric form . the beat phenomenon of this disk precession and the orbital motion yields photometric variations with a period slightly longer than the orbital period @xmath2 ( e.g. whitehurst @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "such oscillations called superhumps are observed only during superoutbursts .",
    "some suuma - type systems with short orbital periods ( @xmath0 8090 min ) show various patterns of the outburst and the superhump evolution which are not easily explained in the current disk instability scheme , such as stars of the wzsge - subclass ( see e.g. nogami @xcite ) and the eruma - subclass ( see e.g. kato et al .",
    "although several models have been proposed to explain their outburst behaviors , especially that of wzsge stars , a common understanding has not yet been reached .",
    "this is partly because there are few observations of dwarf novae just before a superoutburst , owing to the difficulty of predicting a superoutburst .    in this paper",

    "large flickering of @xmath0 0.5 mag can be seen on hjd 2451724 , when this variable star was still about 0.5 mag brighter than its quiescence level .",
    "the superhump period we derived is 0@xmath10601(6 ) , 1.9% longer than @xmath2 of 0@xmath105898(2 ) .",
    "this orbital period is close to the minimum of the period distribution of suuma - type dwarf novae ( see e.g. nogami et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in general",
    ", observations have shown that the amount of time after the maximum of a superoutburst needed for suuma stars to evolve superhumps increases towards shorter orbital periods ( see e.g. table 1 in osaki @xcite ) .",
    "this correlation is also expected on the theoretical grounds : lubow ( @xcite ) showed that the growth rate of the eccentricity is proportional to @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the mass ratio of the secondary mass to the primary mass (= @xmath27 ) .",
    "thus , if a normal suuma star , superhumps in hs1449 + 6415 are expected to appear at least 4 days after the supermaximum . in contrast , fully grown superhumps with an amplitude of 0.32 mag were detected less than 2 days after the maximum of the superoutburst detected on 2000 may 14.864 ( ut ) , only 2.7 day after the end of our ca observations ( vanmunster @xcite ; vanmunster et al .",
    "@xcite ) , taking into account the rise time to the supermaximum .",
    "a determination of the binary parameters of hs1449 + 6415 by spectroscopy may thus be able to test the tidal instability theory .",
    "kato et al . (",
    "@xcite ) pointed out that all eruma stars , i.e. , the most active suuma - type dwarf novae , exhibit a peculiar phenomenon : the amplitude of the superhump is largest around the superoutburst maximum and decreases as the time proceeds even though the superhump period remains almost constant ( see also kato et al .",
    "eruma stars also have very short @xmath2 close to that of hs1449 + 6415 .",
    "the early development of the superhump in the present system may be related to the superhump evolution in eruma stars which is still theoretically unexplained .",
    "to trace the variation of the superhump in hs1449 + 6415 throughout a superoutburst is another future work which should be performed .",
    "wzsge stars , another extreme subset of suuma - type dwarf novae ( odonoghue et al .",
    "@xcite , and references therein ) also have very short orbital periods , similar to that of hs1449 + 6415 .",
    "however , wzsge stars shows only superoutbursts with a very long recurrence time ( @xmath28 10 yr ) and with a very large amplitude ( @xmath29 ) , but no normal outbursts . for this behavior ,",
    "meyer - hofmeister et al .",
    "( @xcite ) proposed a model in which the accretion disk steadily grows during quiescence , and the tidal instability starts before the superoutburst onset . if this model were applicable to hs1449 + 6415 , we could observe superhumps also before the onset of a superoutburst .",
    "however , only modulations with the orbital period were detected in our data .",
    "the amplitude variation in our data before the superoutburst may indicate a beat phenomenon of the orbital hump and the superhump , but a much longer photometric pre - outburst observation would be needed to confirm this hypothesis .",
    "note that the average profile of the orbital modulation is almost the same between just before the superoutburst and before the normal outburst .",
    "this implies that the physical status of the accretion disk and the hot spot , which are thought to emit most of the optical light in quiescence , is quite similar in both these periods .",
    "nothing special seemed to occur before the superoutburst , compared to the situation before the normal outburst , although more observations of the orbital modulation with much smaller errors are needed to strictly probe differencies of the accretion disk in different phases .",
    "the brightest magnitude of hs1449 + 6415 reported to vsnet is @xmath30 = 14.1 ( kinnunen @xcite ) , after calibration using the magnitude of the comparison star ( kinnunen , private communication ) given by henden ( @xcite ) .",
    "the amplitude of the superoutburst , thus , is @xmath03.5 mag , which is the smallest among suuma stars with orbital periods shorter than 90 min , other than eruma stars ( see e.g. table 1 in nogami et al .",
    "as mentioned above , the normal outburst was caught about 40 days after the onset of the superoutburst . if this value is considered as the recurrence cycle of the outbursts , this is typical for an suuma star ( see e.g. table 1 in nogami et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the vsnet data can exclude the possibility of an outburst - recurrence cycle shorter than 14 days .",
    "the combination of the outburst amplitude of 3.5 mag and the recurrence cycle of 40 days is almost the same as that in sxlmi , which is regarded as the dwarf nova bridging the gap between eruma stars and suuma stars ( nogami et al .",
    "the orbital period of 0@xmath106717(11 ) (= 97 min ) of sxlmi ( wagner et al .",
    "@xcite ) is , however , a little out of range of the orbital period distribution of eruma stars and wzsge stars .",
    "thus , hs1449 + 6415 is an intermediate object between eruma stars and wzsge stars , and might be in the evolutionary transition state between eruma and wzsge phases .",
    "+ 6415 deserves to be monitored over long timescales to measure the accurate recurrence cycles of the normal outburst and the superoutburst and to reveal variations of these cycles and the outburst amplitude .",
