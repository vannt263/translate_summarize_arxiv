    "a permutation @xmath6 of length @xmath7 is written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",

    "as usual , @xmath11 denotes the symmetric group on @xmath12=\\{1,2 , ... , n\\}$ ] .",
    "let @xmath6 and @xmath13 be two permutations of lengths @xmath7 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "we say that @xmath13 is @xmath6-_avoiding _ if there is no subsequence @xmath15 of @xmath12 $ ] such that @xmath16 .",

    "@xmath6 .",
    "for example , the permutation @xmath20 avoids @xmath21 but does not avoid @xmath22 because of its subsequence @xmath23 .",
    "an equivalent , but perhaps more insightful , definition is the following reformulation in terms of matrices .",
    "let @xmath24 . the _ permutation matrix _",
    "@xmath25 is the @xmath26 matrix having a @xmath27 in position @xmath28 for @xmath29 , and having @xmath30 elsewhere .",
    ", we coordinatize @xmath25 from the bottom left corner . ] given two permutation matrices @xmath31 and @xmath32 , we say that @xmath31 _ avoids _",
    "@xmath32 if no submatrix of @xmath31 is identical to @xmath32 .    note that a permutation matrix @xmath31 of size @xmath14 is simply a transversal of an @xmath26 matrix , i.e. an arrangement of 1 s for which there is exactly one 1 in every row and in every column of @xmath31 .",
    "it is clear that a permutation @xmath33 contains a subsequence @xmath34 if and only if @xmath35 contains @xmath25 as a submatrix .",
    "let @xmath36 denote the set of @xmath6-avoiding permutations in @xmath11 .",
    "two permutations @xmath6 and @xmath37 are called _ wilf - equivalent _ if they are equally restrictive : @xmath38 for all @xmath39 .",
    "we denote this by @xmath40 .",
    "if @xmath41 for @xmath42 , then we say that @xmath6 and @xmath37 are _ equinumerant _ up to level @xmath14 .",
    "the basic problem in the theory of forbidden subsequences is to classify all permutations up to wilf - equivalence . obviously , if two permutations are wilf - equivalent , then they must be of the same length .",
    "further , many wilf - equivalences can be deduced by symmetry arguments within the same @xmath43 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath35 contains @xmath25 as a submatrix , then the transpose matrix @xmath44 contains @xmath45 .",
    "the same is true when simultaneously reflecting both matrices @xmath35 and @xmath25 in either a horizontal or a vertical axis of symmetry .",
    "the three operations defined above generate the dihedral group @xmath46 acting on the set of permutation matrices in the obvious way .",
    "the orbits of @xmath46 in @xmath43 are called _",
    "symmetry classes_. it is clear that if @xmath6 and @xmath37 belong to the same symmetry class in @xmath43 , then @xmath47 .",
    "however , wilf - classes are in general , but apparently rarely , larger than single symmetry classes .",
    "this makes the classification of permutations up to wilf - equivalence a subtle and difficult process .",
    "the first major result in the theory of forbidden subsequences states that @xmath48 , and hence @xmath49 is one wilf - class , which combines the two symmetry classes of @xmath50 and @xmath51 . as the behest of wilf , bijections between @xmath52 and @xmath53 were given by simion - schmidt @xcite , rotem @xcite , richards @xcite , and west @xcite .",
    "they all prove @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the @xmath14th catalan number .",
    "permutations with forbidden subsequences arise naturally in computer science in connection with sorting problems and strings with forbidden subwords .",
    "for example , in @xcite-@xcite knuth shows that @xmath56 is the set of stack - sortable permutations ( see also @xcite ) , so that @xmath57 is the number of binary strings of length @xmath58 , in which 0 stands for a `` move into a stack '' and 1 symbolizes a `` move out from the stack '' .    numerous problems involving forbidden subsequences have also appeared in algebraic combinatorics . in the late 1980s",
    ", it was discovered that the property of avoiding 2143 exactly characterizes the _ vexillary _ permutations , i.e. those whose stanley symmetric function is a schur function .",
    "( see @xcite for a good exposition . )",
    "lakshimibai and sandhya @xcite likewise show that @xmath59 is the set of permutations indexing an interesting subclass of schubert varieties . and",
    "billey and warrington @xcite have very recently defined a class of permutations under 5 restrictions which are related to the kazhdan - lusztig polynomials .",
    "this all naturally leads to the study and classification of wilf - classes of permutations of length 4 or more .",
    "the classification of @xmath60 turns out to be much more complicated than that of @xmath49 .",
    "it is completed in a series of papers by stankova and west .",
    "they utilize the concept of a _ generating tree _",
    "@xmath61 of @xmath62 : the nodes on the @xmath7th level of @xmath63 are the permutations in @xmath36 , and the descendants of @xmath64 are obtained from @xmath13 by inserting @xmath65 in appropriate places in @xmath13 .",
    "clearly , the tree isomorphism @xmath66 implies @xmath67 , but the converse is far from true . in @xcite ,",
    "west shows @xmath68 . in @xcite",
    ", stankova constructs a specific isomorphism @xmath69 . in @xcite , she completes the classification of @xmath60 by proving @xmath70 ; there she uses a different approach which yields the somewhat surprising result that , while @xmath71 , on every level of the two trees the number of nodes with a given number of descendants is the same for both trees .",
    "thus , the seven symmetry classes of @xmath60 are grouped in three wilf - classes , with representatives ( 4132 ) , ( 1234 ) and ( 1324 ) ( cf .",
    "[ fig - s4 ] . )    in @xcite , babson - west show @xmath72 for any @xmath73 , and @xmath74 for any @xmath1 , thus completing the classification up to level 5 . the key idea is the concept of a stronger wilf - equivalence relation",
    ".    a _ transversal _ @xmath75 of a young diagram @xmath76 is an arrangement of 1 s and 0 s such that every row and every column of @xmath76 has exactly one 1 in it .",
    "a subset of 1 s in @xmath75 is said to form a _",
    "submatrix _ of @xmath76 if all columns and rows of @xmath76 passing through these 1 s intersect _ inside _ @xmath76 . for a permutation @xmath62 , we say that @xmath75 _ contains _ pattern @xmath6 if some @xmath7 1 s of @xmath75 form a submatrix of @xmath76 identical to @xmath25 ( cf .",
    "[ fig - splitting ] . )    given several 1 s in a transversal @xmath75 , the condition for them to form a submatrix of @xmath75 is the same as the requirement that the column of the rightmost 1 and the row of the lowest 1 must intersect _ inside _ @xmath76 .",
    "this condition is necessary for the new definition to be a useful generalization of the classical definition of a forbidden subsequence , as we shall see below . in particular , when @xmath76 is a square diagram , the two definitions coincide .",
    "let us denote by @xmath77 the set of all transversals of @xmath76 which avoid @xmath6 .",
    "two permutations @xmath6 and @xmath37 are called _ shape - wilf - equivalent _ ( swe ) if @xmath78 for all young diagrams @xmath76 .",
    "we denote this by @xmath79 .",
    "clearly , @xmath79 implies @xmath80 , but not conversely .",
    "we will write @xmath81 for the young diagram @xmath76 whose @xmath82-th row has @xmath83 cells , @xmath84 . in order for a young diagram @xmath76 to have any transversals at all",
    ", @xmath76 must have the same number of rows and columns and @xmath76 must contain the _ staircase _",
    "diagram @xmath85 , where @xmath14 is the number of cells in the top ( largest ) row of @xmath76 .",
    "thus , from now on , when we talk about a young diagram @xmath76 of size @xmath14 , we will assume that @xmath76 has @xmath14 rows and @xmath14 columns and contains @xmath86 of size @xmath14 .",
    "swe is a very strong relation on two permutations and it is certainly too restrictive on its own to be useful in the general classification of permutations .",
    "however , combined with the proposition below ( see @xcite ) , it allows for more wilf - equivalences to be established .",
    "let @xmath87 for some permutation matrices @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "then for any permutation matrix @xmath90 : @xmath91 [ prop - bw ]    let @xmath92 be the @xmath93 identity matrix , and let @xmath94 be its reflection across a vertical axis of symmetry . according to backelin - west - xin in @xcite , @xmath95 for any @xmath7 , and hence @xmath96 for any @xmath97 .",
    "this swe generalizes the results in @xcite and @xcite , but it is not sufficient to complete the classification of @xmath5 , nor of @xmath98 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     however , the above counterexamples do not preclude an _",

    "we can order asymptotically all permutations in @xmath11 , modulo wilf - equivalence .",
    "[ weak - order ]    regev @xcite and bona @xcite have worked on asymptotic behavior of certain types of permutations , but as of now , conjecture  [ weak - order ] and some possible modifications of it are far from proven .",
