    "for a long time , singly deuterated interstellar molecules are known to be present in cold molecular clouds with an extremely high abundance enhancement due to chemical fractionation @xcite .",
    "the formation of deuterated molecules is preferred at low temperatures ( @xmath280 k ) and leads to a high degree of fractionation in cold and dense dark clouds without embedded luminous sources .",
    "these prestellar cores offer the opportunity to study the cold and dense evolutionary stage in which the deuteration of molecules supposedly occurred .",
    "although this is a relatively well understood chemical process , the observation in the last few years of multiply deuterated molecules has renewed interest in deuterium fractionation in dense clouds : nd@xmath0h @xcite ; nd@xmath0h and d@xmath0co @xcite ; nd@xmath3 @xcite ; d@xmath0s @xcite ; d@xmath0co @xcite ; chd@xmath0oh and cd@xmath3oh @xcite . among these deuterium isotopic species , there are , so far , only three sulfur bearing deuterated molecules , hds and d@xmath0s , detected towards several protostars and dense cores @xcite ; and hdcs , which has been detected toward tmc-1 @xcite .    our new data and , in particular the high enhancement in the fractionation of multiply deuterated species , are requiring a review of chemical models .",
    "the presence of deuterated molecular species in star forming regions like orion - irc2 and iras 16293 - 2422 @xcite has been taken as signs for an active grain surface chemistry followed by desorption when the physical processes associated to recent star formation activity increases the temperature of the gas and of dust grains . however , this is not the case for dark clouds , where the kinetic temperature is too low for efficient evaporation of ice grain mantles .",
    "@xcite found that gas phase chemistry can account for the large abundances of both singly and doubly deuterated molecules when the gas is very depleted of molecules and atoms .",
    "the reason is that both co and o efficiently destroy h@xmath4 .",
    "hence when co and o are sufficiently depleted , h@xmath4 is converted efficiently into h@xmath0d@xmath5 in the reaction with hd .",
    "subsequent reactions of h@xmath0d@xmath5 with hd leads to d@xmath0h@xmath5 and finally to the formation of d@xmath4 .",
    "these ions propagate the deuterium to other molecules @xcite . in their model , @xcite ,",
    "conclude that in regions where co is higly depleted , the abundance of d@xmath0h@xmath5 will be simillar than that of h@xmath0d@xmath5 and that d@xmath4 could be the most abundant form of deuterated h@xmath4 . the first prediction has been confirmed recently with the detection of d@xmath0h@xmath5 toward the prestellar core 16293e @xcite . for an early evolution time",
    "( @xmath62 - 4@xmath710@xmath8 yr ) the double and triple deuterated species could have large enhancements @xcite . in the case of barnard 1 , @xcite , based on their c@xmath9o and c@xmath10o ( 2 - 1 ) observations found that c@xmath9o / h@xmath0=5.4@xmath710@xmath11 , which is @xmath63 times lower than the canonical value , c@xmath9o / h@xmath0=1.7@xmath710@xmath12 @xcite , indicating that an appreciable amount of co is depleted onto grains .",
    "modelling with low temperature conditions and high depletion factors allows a satisfactory comparison with the observations of doubly and triply deuterated ammonia -see e.g. nhd@xmath0 towards l134n @xcite- and also helps to explain the high abundances observed in star forming regions in terms of grain chemistry models .",
    "the recent detection of doubly deuterated h@xmath0s provides a stimulating impetus to consider other sulfur molecules and extend the previously elaborated chemical schemes .    during a 3 mm line survey on dark clouds ( barnard 1 , tmc-1 , l1544 , l183 -marcelino et al . , in prep .",
    ") , we found several transitions that initially were considered as unidentified .",
    "taking into account the reduced number of possible candidates , the fact that the lines were strongest in barnard 1 ( see figure 1 ) , and the strong deuterium enhancement found in these sources by several authors ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , we concluded that these lines were arising from d@xmath0cs and hdcs . while single deuterated thioformaldehyde had been detected at lower frequencies in tmc-1 @xcite",
    "; this is now the first detection of d@xmath0cs in space .",
    "once the carriers were identified , and given the extremely large deuterium enhacement indicated by the observations , we concentrated our efforts and available observing time in the source showing the strongest lines , i.e. , barnard 1 . in section 2",
    "we present the observing procedures and in section 3 the main results . in this section",
    "we discuss the rotational constants of thioformaldehyde and its isotopomers .",
    "we also analyze the physical and chemical conditions of barnard 1 and derive the column densities for the different thioformaldehyde isotopic species .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the discussion and to the chemical analysis of the results .",
    "the observations were carried out using the iram 30-m radio telescope at pico veleta ( near granada , spain ) between 2003 october and 2004 february .",
    "spectral lines arising from singly and doubly deuterated thioformaldehyde between 83 and 155 ghz were observed in october . in january",
    "we performed most of the observations for the main isotopic species .",
    "up to four sis receivers were used simultaneously .",
    "each receiver was tuned to single side band with image rejections within 20 - 27 db ( 3 mm receivers ) , 12 - 16 db ( 2 mm receivers ) and 13 db ( 1 mm receivers ) .",
    "system temperatures were 100 - 225 k in october for the 3 and 2 mm receivers with atmospheric opacities between 0.05 - 0.1 .",
    "in 2004 january weather conditions were even better allowing excellent observations at 1 mm . during this run",
    "we obtained temperatures below 100 k at 3 mm and below 200 k at 1 mm ( atmospheric opacities at 225 ghz were below 0.1 ) .",
    "calibration was performed using two absorbers at different temperatures and the atm code developed by @xcite and recently updated by @xcite .",
    "an autocorrelator providing several backends with 40 khz and 80 khz of resolution was used .",
    "the velocity resolution was between 0.08 - 0.23 kms@xmath13 depending on the frequency .",
    "telescope pointing and focus were checked every 1 and 3 hours respectively on strong and nearby continuum sources .",
    "the largest pointing error between consecutive pointing scans never exceeded 3 \" .",
    "most of the observations were performed using wobbler and frequency switching techniques , using for the latter a frequency throw of 7.2 mhz -which eliminates the main ripple component coming from the telescope- and in some cases we used position switching .",
    "the throw for wobbler and position switching was 240 \" and 10 respectively , both in azimut .",
    "taking into account the size of the source , these offsets are enough to provide a clean reference . on - source integration times were typically @xmath61 - 2h , resulting in rms main beam antenna temperatures between 15 - 50 mk .",
    "observed line parameters obtained from gaussian fits to the observed lines are given in table 1 and the line profiles are shown in fig . 2 - 4 .",
    "line intensities for the observed transitions are given in main beam brightness temperature scale .",
    "the main beam telescope efficiencies are 0.78 - 0.75 , 0.69 and 0.57 at 3 , 2 and 1 mm respectively .    in order to compare the deuterium enhancement in thioformaldehyde with that of formaldehyde we also observed several rotational transitions of h@xmath0co , hdco , d@xmath0co and h@xmath14co in 2004 february .",
    "the observed line parameters are given in table 2 and the corresponding line profiles are shown in figure 5 .",
    "figure 2a shows the observed lines for the singly and doubly deuterated species of thioformaldehyde .",
    "the fact that the same transitions of both molecules appear at different velocities when assuming the predicted frequencies from available line frequency catalogs -see , e.g. , jpl @xcite ; kln @xcite ; lovas @xcite and cernicharo @xcite- indicates a considerable error in the frequencies used . we have used the new frequencies for these species derived from our observations to improve the molecular constants and to obtain better values for line prediction at higher frequencies ( see section 3.1 ) .",
    "figure 2b shows that the agreement between hdcs and d@xmath0cs line profiles is excellent when the new predicted frequencies for both species are used .",
    "in figure 2 we can see that lines arising from hdcs are moderately stronger than those from d@xmath0cs , which , although indicating a large column density for the singly deuterated species also implies a very high d - enhancement for d@xmath0cs ( see below ) .",
    "line widths are rather narrow as indicated in table 1 .",
    "the similarity between line profiles from both species indicates that they coexist spatially .",
    "we observe a double peak profile for h@xmath0co lines probably due to selfabsorption by foreground gas ( the high velocity gas associated with iras 03301 + 3057 , a young stellar object which is close to the strong ammonia peak , could also , perhaps , affect the line profile of formaldehyde ; we have checked that the absorption feature is not coming from emission in the off position by checking the spectra in frequency switching mode ) .",
    "lines from the deuterated species of h@xmath0co and from h@xmath0@xmath15co are wider than the lines arising from thioformaldehyde and its isotopomers , but less than those of h@xmath0co and they do not show the line wings observed in formaldehyde .",
    "lines arising from h@xmath0co are stronger than those from h@xmath0cs and lines from hdco and d@xmath0co are about two times stronger than the lines arising from deuterated thioformaldehyde , indicating a higher column density for the different h@xmath0co isotopic species .      in order to have a coherent picture of the line profile from the different transitions of thioformaldehyde and its isotopes we performed a determination of the velocity of the source as a mandatory step in deriving line frequencies .",
    "we used 19 molecular lines that were observed in barnard 1 during the present work , and for which laboratory frequencies or confident frequency predictions are available ( jpl , kln , lovas , and/or cernicharo catalogs ; see above ) .",
    "the lines showing some evidences of opacity effects were discarded .",
    "finally , only lines from cch ( some hyperfine components ) , methanol , deuterated formaldehyde , ccs , and one of the hyperfine components of the @xmath16 transition of cn were used .",
    "the averaged velocity obtained from these lines is 6.70@xmath170.05 km s@xmath13 , where the error translates the uncertainty from laboratory measurements and also the presence of a second velocity component in the cloud at 7.5 km s@xmath13 that reduces the accuracy of the gaussian fits .",
    "the estimated lsr velocity of 6.70 km s@xmath13 was assumed for all lines in table 1 when deriving observed frequencies .    we have observed four hdcs transitions , based on the frequencies calculated from the rotational constants of @xcite and seven from d@xmath0cs based on the frequencies derived from the rotational constants of @xcite .",
    "the rotational constants for the latter species have been derived from high @xmath18 transitions .",
    "however , the largest frequency covered by the laboratory data is 35 ghz , hence , one could expect significant uncertainties for rotational transitions at large frequencies . a comparison of the line profiles of hdcs and d@xmath0cs ( fig .",
    "2 ) suggests frequency errors in the latter species as large as 0.1 - 0.2 mhz .",
    "even for hdcs for which the rotational constants have been derived from a significant set of data @xcite , observed frequencies in dark clouds are often different from those obtained in the laboratory . as an example , the 3@xmath19 - 2@xmath20 line of hdcs has been observed by @xcite with a laboratory frequency of 92981.601@xmath170.018 mhz , while the same authors reported a frequency for this line from observations of tmc-1 of 92981.680 mhz .",
    "we have observed the same line in barnard 1 with much better signal to noise ratio and we obtain ( see table 1 ) a frequency of 92981.658@xmath170.030 mhz .",
    "consequently , the use of the laboratory frequency will produce a 0.17 km s@xmath13 velocity shift in the line -see figure 2 .",
    "it seems evident that the calculated frequencies in the available line catalogs have significant errors for some molecules .",
    "this is a critical point , because astronomers often compare line profiles from different isotopomers of a given molecular species to trace cloud collapse or line opacities .",
    "uncertainties in computed frequencies larger than 20 khz will produce significant velocity shifts when comparing different lines from the same species or from different molecules .",
    "the situation is even worse for rare isotopic substitutions like deuterium , @xmath1s or @xmath15c .",
    "the rare isotopomer h@xmath0c@xmath1s is a much better tracer of the column density of thioformaldehyde than the lines from the main isotope .",
    "we observed several lines of this species ( see table 1 ) using frequencies from the jpl line catalog .",
    "the number of measured laboratory frequencies for this species is small and , hence , computed frequencies have considerable uncertainties .",
    "for example the 3@xmath19 - 2@xmath20 line predicted at 101283.899 mhz was observed at 101284.331 mhz , the 3@xmath21 - 2@xmath22 line predicted at 102810.609 mhz was observed at 102807.426 mhz , the 4@xmath23 - 3@xmath24 predicted at 133031.473 mhz was observed at 133027.035 mhz , and the 4@xmath24 - 3@xmath21 line predicted at 137077.543 mhz was observed at 137071.099 mhz .",
    "that the observed frequencies were corresponding to the searched lines of h@xmath0c@xmath1s was confirmed by a simultaneous fit ( see below ) to the laboratory and space frequencies of a few rotational constants ( several of them fixed to the values of the main isotope -note that h@xmath0cs and h@xmath0c@xmath1s have the same inertia moment around the a axis of the molecule ) .",
    "the large differences that are found between space spectroscopy and predicted frequencies could prompt for negative results and/or to reach a confuse situation as we often look the on - line frequency catalogs as a final product ready to be used .",
    "special care has to be taken when using frequencies predicted from a fit to a reduced number of observed lines , or for predictions in frequency domains outside those observed in the laboratories .    using the astronomically measured frequencies given in table 1 and those observed in the laboratories we performed fits to the rotational constants of h@xmath0cs , h@xmath0c@xmath1s , d@xmath0cs and hdcs .",
    "the results are given in tables 3 to 6 .",
    "these tables also give the fits obtained from the laboratory data alone .",
    "although hdcs is a nearly prolate symmetric top and a s - reduced hamiltonian should be preferred @xcite , we adopted the asymmetric ( a ) reduced form of the watson hamiltonian in a i@xmath25 representation @xcite .",
    "laboratory frequencies for the different isotopic species have been taken from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although it seems that the rotational constants in tables 3 - 6 show little variation between those obtained from laboratory data and those derived from laboratory plus space observations , these variations account for changes in the predicted frequencies of 0.1 - 0.2 mhz between both sets of data .",
    "the species the less affected by the introduction of the space frequencies is hdcs and the most h@xmath0c@xmath1s .",
    "one could think that the situation should be better for the main isotope of thioformaldehyde for which 60 of its rotational lines have been measured in the laboratory .",
    "however , figure 3 shows that the laboratory frequencies and the calculated ones result in different velocities for the lines .",
    "although , the uncertainties in the laboratory measurements are large , we could expect that the global fit to all laboratory data will produce rotational constants accurate enough to allow a good estimate of the spectrum of h@xmath0cs . as can be seen in the central panels of figure 3",
    "this is really the case , but these predictions are not accurate enough for the narrow lines emerging from dark clouds .",
    "hence , the frequencies of the eight observed lines of h@xmath0cs were obtained following a similar procedure to that adopted for its rare isotopes and a new set of rotational constants was obtained .",
    "the results are given in table 3 .",
    "with the new set of rotational constants for the four isotopomers of thioformaldehyde , we have computed their frequencies and those corresponding to the observed lines are given in table 1 .",
    "the observed lines of h@xmath0co show an asymmetric profile with a red line wing which could arise from molecular outflows ( see below ) . for h@xmath0co , hdco and also hdcs , the observed lines present a second peak at @xmath67.5",
    ". this velocity component is also observed in hc@xmath10o@xmath5 , cch , c - c@xmath3h and hc@xmath3n . @xcite",
    "already found , based on the asymmetric and wide @xmath15co line profiles , two velocity components in the cloud ( at 6.5 and 7.2 km s@xmath26 ) .",
    "the lines of d@xmath0co peak at 6.7 km s@xmath13 ( see figure 5 ) , while those of hdco and h@xmath14co have their emission maxima at slightly lower velocities .",
    "if we assume for these lines a cloud velocity of 6.7 kms@xmath13 , then the frequencies for the lines of these two isotopes of h@xmath0co will be 0.1 mhz above of the predicted ones , which are much more accurate ( large number of measured lines in the laboratory ) than those of the isotopes of h@xmath0cs .",
    "hence the observed velocities for hdco and h@xmath14co could correspond to optical depth effects or to chemical cloud structure .",
    "in fact , the high intensity of the hdco lines and the asymmetric profiles in h@xmath0co indicate high optical depths in the barnard 1 core , or high foreground column densities , in the rotational lines of this species , even in those of hdco .",
    "barnard 1 is one of the highest column density molecular sources in the perseus complex with recent low - mass star formation activity , as indicated by several young stellar objects -three of them without optical counterpart- detected by iras .",
    "@xcite made the first study of this region using visual extinction maps derived from star counts ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and emission maps of co and its isotopomers , hco@xmath5 , h@xmath15co@xmath5 and nh@xmath3 . from star counts , they found barnard 1 to be composed of two condensations of a@xmath27@xmath285 mag .",
    "they modeled the cloud in four regions -core , internal and external envelope and halo- of different size and physical conditions depending on the line intensities of the observed molecules ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",

    ". the rest of the cloud can be characterised by different isotopomers of co. the density of the internal envelope was obtained from c@xmath9o emission and results to be 2@xmath710@xmath29 @xmath30 .",
    "this region is very extended ( @xmath61 pc ) and contains the young stellar objects and the nh@xmath3 globule .",
    "the visual extinction here is @xmath63 - 4 mag . the external envelope , with a density below 10@xmath29 @xmath30 and a@xmath27@xmath62 - 3 mag ,",
    "was studied from @xmath15co emission .",
    "the halo ( a@xmath27@xmath61 - 2 mag ) is the most external zone with a large spatial size and traced by moderate / weak co emission -see also @xcite .",
    "they also made a dynamical study of the cloud and concluded that it is being supported by magnetic fields and/or turbulence .",
    "@xcite mapped barnard 1 in several molecules with higher angular resolution , resolving some spatial structures in the main dense core from observations of nh@xmath3 .",
    "in this region they found density values of 7@xmath710@xmath8 @xmath30 in the southern clump , and @xmath353.7@xmath710@xmath8 @xmath30 in the northern one .",
    "they studied the external and the internal envelopes from @xmath15co , c@xmath9o and cs emission .",
    "cs maps show the dense region to have a size of @xmath6 2 pc @xmath7 5 pc ( at 350 pc of distance ) .",
    "the strongest emission of this molecule is restricted to the internal envelope , but extends to the external one with lower intensities , probably due to the existence of several dense clumps .",

    "the kinetic temperature is 11 - 14 k in the densest regions and increases to t@xmath3720 k at the edge of the cloud , showing that the cloud is submitted to some heating from the exterior .",

    ", @xcite found a high velocity flow emerging from iras 03301 + 3057 , a young stellar object located near the strong ammonia peak ( b1-a ) .",
    "this outflow , which covers a region of about @xmath42 , was studied in detail by @xcite from co ( @xmath43 ) emission and by @xcite from sio @xmath41 and @xmath43 lines .",
    "the interaction of the flow with the ambient gas is traced by the different herbig - haro objects present in this cloud @xcite .",
    "the wings in the h@xmath0co lines shown in figure 5 could be produced by the high velocity gas associated to iras 03301 + 3057 ( located in b1-a ) .",
    "note , however , that our position ( the b1-b clump ) is about @xmath44 east from this source , and from the compact sio peak which marks the place were the outflow interacts with the cloud material .",
    "hence , the wings could be unrelated to the deuterium source .",
    "formaldehyde and thioformaldehyde have both a nuclear spin statistics that separates the rotational levels into two different sets .",
    "radiative and collisional transitions between ortho and para species are strictly forbidden , hence , these two species behave like two different molecules .",
    "rotational levels with k@xmath45 and k@xmath46 values even / odd or even / even belong to the para species while those with odd / even and odd / odd belong to the ortho species .",
    "for h@xmath0co , h@xmath0cs , and their @xmath15c isotopic species the nuclear spin statistics leads to a 3:1 value for the ortho / para ratio .",
    "the singly deuterated species hdco and hdcs do not have this separation on the rotational levels because the symmetry of the molecule has been broken by the deuteration .",
    "however , these species have b - type rotational transitions as deuteration introduces a weak permanent dipole moment along the b axis of the molecule ( typically 0.2 - 0.3 d ) .",
    "doubly deuterated species on the other hand also have a symmetry axis , and the nuclear spin statistics separate the rotational levels .",
    "however , as the nuclear spins are different , rotational levels of doubly deuterated isotopic species with k@xmath45 and k@xmath46 values odd / even or odd / odd belong to the para species , and those with even / odd even / even to the ortho one , i.e. , just the opposite than for the main isotopic species .",
    "moreover , the ortho / para ratio in the doubly deuterated species of formaldehyde and thioformaldehyde is 2 .      in order to derive column densities for thioformaldehyde and their isotopes",
    "we have proceeded in two different ways .",
    "the first method we have used consists in the analysis of rotational diagrams for the observed isotopes of thioformaldehyde , see , e.g. , @xcite . from these diagrams",
    "one can obtain the molecular column density and the excitation temperature of the molecular rotational levels ( assuming all levels are populated by a single excitation temperature ) . from these diagrams",
    "we obtain common rotational temperatures close to 10 k , @xmath47=9.5@xmath171.0 , 10.2@xmath172.0 , and 7.4@xmath170.8 k for hdcs , d@xmath0cs and h@xmath0cs respectively , which suggests that the molecular hydrogen volume density is large enough to thermalize the rotational levels of these molecules ( in the case of thermalization , @xmath47 should be close to @xmath48 ) .",
    "the derived column densities for these species , assuming that the emitting source fills the beam of the 30-m radio telescope , are n(h@xmath0cs)=1.2 - 2.0@xmath710@xmath15 @xmath33 , n(hdcs)=4.5 - 7.0@xmath710@xmath32 @xmath33 , n(d@xmath0cs)=1.0 - 4.0@xmath710@xmath32 @xmath33 .",
    "hence , the abundance ratios are n(h@xmath0cs)/n(hdcs)@xmath493@xmath171 , n(hdcs)/n(d@xmath0cs)@xmath493@xmath172 , and n(h@xmath0cs)/n(d@xmath0cs)@xmath499@xmath173 .",
    "finally , for h@xmath0c@xmath1s we have assumed the rotational temperature obtained for h@xmath0cs to derive n(h@xmath0c@xmath1s)= 6.0@xmath173.0@xmath710@xmath50 @xmath33 .",
    "the column densities of h@xmath0cs and h@xmath0c@xmath1s are compatible with a galactic @xmath51s/@xmath1s ratio of 24.4@xmath175.0 @xcite",
    ". this analysis does not provide any insight on the volume density and assumes that the lines are optically thin ( which seems to be correct in view of the low column density derived for h@xmath0c@xmath1s ) .",
    "the volume density and other physical parameters could be derived through the observed line intensities and a large velocity gradient code ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) if the collisional rates are known .",
    "we have adopted for h@xmath0cs the collisional rates of formaldehyde computed by @xcite , multiplied by a factor of 2 to take into account the different effective surface and different energy of the levels of h@xmath0cs ( a similar factor to that existing between the collisional rates of co and of cs ) .",
    "taking into account that we have observed a large number of lines of h@xmath0cs , we could check that the adopted collisional cross sections produce a good fit to the observed intensities using reasonable values for the gas density and temperature .",
    "of course , the final result has to be in good agreement with the column densities and rotational temperatures derived from the rotational diagrams . assuming a kinetic temperature of 10 k ( see section 3.2.1 ) we derive rotational temperatures for the observed transitions of thioformaldehyde between 6.5 and 9.1 k for volume densities of 2 - 4@xmath710@xmath52 @xmath30 and a column density of ortho and para species of 1.2 and 0.5@xmath710@xmath15 @xmath33 respectively .",
    "these values are in reasonable agreement with those derived from the rotational diagrams .    for d@xmath0cs",
    "we have also used the same collision rates as for h@xmath0cs .",

    "the collisional rates could be rather different from those of the main isotope .",
    "we have tried to fit the data using the collisional rates for hnco , but it was difficult to reach a good fit to the data with reasonable values for the physical parameters ( which could be expected from this crude approximation to the collisional rates of hdcs ) .",
    "we adopt for hdcs the values obtained above from the rotational diagrams ( note that the lvg values for the other species compare very well with those obtained from the rotational diagrams ) .",
    "the column density of formaldehyde and its isotopes have been derived from an lvg analysis of the observed intensities , adopting the collisional rates of @xcite .",
    "the line profile of h@xmath0co indicates opacities larger than 1 .",
    "hence , the column density for this species has been derived from the isotope h@xmath14co assuming an @xmath32c/@xmath15c isotopic ratio for dark clouds of 50 @xcite .",
    "assuming again a kinetic temperature of 10 k , the observed intensities give n(h@xmath14co)=1.2@xmath170.5@xmath710@xmath32 @xmath33 , n(h@xmath0)=3@xmath710@xmath52 @xmath30 .",
    "there is no indication for an ortho / para ratio different than 3 from the observational data .",
    "the column density for the doubly deuterated species is n(d@xmath0co)=3.0@xmath171.5@xmath710@xmath32 @xmath33 .",
    "for the single deuterated species we have assumed the same rotational temperatures as for the other isotopes of formaldehyde to obtain n(hdco)=7@xmath172@xmath710@xmath32 @xmath33 .",
    "hence , the isotopic ratios are n(h@xmath0co)/n(hdco)@xmath497 , n(h@xmath0co)/n(d@xmath0co)@xmath4913 , and n(hdco)/n(d@xmath0co)@xmath492.5 .",
    "while the abundance ratios of singly over doubly deuterated species for formaldehyde and thioformaldehyde are similar ( @xmath63 ) , the abundance ratio between the main isotope and the singly deuterated species is twice larger in thioformaldehyde compared to formaldehyde .",
    "table 7 sumarizes several studies in dark clouds and star forming regions where deuterated molecules have been found . for barnard 1 ,",
    "the new ratios obtained in this work for h@xmath0cs and h@xmath0co are also shown . comparing with other deuterated species detected towards this core",
    ", we can see that the d - enhancement of thioformaldehyde is among the highest values .",
    "in general the abundance ratios in barnard 1 are only comparable with those found in the class 0 binary protostar iras 16293 - 2422 .",
    "that means that deuteration processes should be similar in both sources and different than in dark and quiescent clouds .",
    "we have extended our chemical network dedicated to deuterium containing molecules ( * ? ? ?",
    "* roueff et al .",

    "we have assumed , as is usual in similar studies , that deuterated species behave as the main isotopic species and we have calculated the different branching ratios from statistical arguments except when dissociative recombination reactions were considered . in this latter case , we have assumed that removal of an hydrogen atom was more efficient that the release of d by a factor of 2 .",
    "this has indeed been seen in various experimental studies of multiply deuterated molecular ions as discussed by @xcite .",
    "the chemical reaction rate coefficients have been taken from our own chemical network @xcite , updated with the recent compilation of @xcite and from the available chemical network of the ohio state university ( herbst and coworkers ) . as is recalled in @xcite , deuterium enrichment is initiated by the fractionation reactions of h@xmath4 , ch@xmath4 and c@xmath0h@xmath55 with d and hd .",
    "we have extended the reactions to the partially deuterated species until the fully deuterated ions d@xmath4 , cd@xmath4 and c@xmath0d@xmath55 are formed -as studied in the laboratory by @xcite .",
    "another important addition consists in considering the fractionation reactions with d@xmath0 , which allows more substantial deuterium enhancement .",
    "recent laboratory studies have shown that the reactions are significantly less efficient as currently assumed ( cf . * ? ? ? * ) and that the reverse endothermic reaction may be more rapid than expected from pure thermodynamics .",
    "we have thus taken the reaction rate coefficients derived from the experiments @xcite but determined the reverse reactions with the calculated endothermicity .",
    "we have also introduced possible fractionation reactions of h@xmath0cs@xmath5 , h@xmath3cs@xmath5 and h@xmath3s@xmath5 with hd , which could occur but have not been considered until now as no experimental or theoretical information is available .",
    "the corresponding reactions and rate coefficients are displayed in table 8 where the values of the endothermicities involved in the backward reactions have been guessed .",
    "as the langevin collision rates have been assumed , the results obtained by including these reactions will give upper limits for the deuterium fractionation .",
    "their influence is discussed below .",
    "we did not include the chemistry of methanol .",
    "the resulting chemical network consists in 210 species linked by more than 3000 chemical reactions .",
    "details and discussion on the deuterated chemistry are discussed in roueff et al .",
    "( 2004 , in prep . )",
    "and we focus the present discussion to the sulfur compound deuteration .",
    "recent observations have shown that enhanced deuteration is linked to large depletions ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "we consider then three different models with h@xmath0 densities of 10@xmath8 , 10@xmath52 and 10@xmath40 and different elemental depletions as displayed in table 9 .",
    "these three models correspond approximately to the conditions found in tmc-1 , barnard 1 and l134n ( see , * ? ? ?",

    "the cosmic ionization rate and the temperature are kept constant and equal respectively to 2@xmath710@xmath56 s@xmath13 and 10 k. the sulfur abundance is also taken constant and typical of the low metal case , i.e. s / h@xmath0 = 3.70@xmath710@xmath12 .",
    "the table shows that , as expected , deuteration increases from models 1 to 3 .",
    "fractionation reactions involving h@xmath0co@xmath5 , h@xmath3co@xmath5 , h@xmath3s@xmath5 and h@xmath3cs@xmath5 , are seen to be of considerable importance for the fractionation of h@xmath0s .",
    "however , their role is much less for formaldehyde and thioformaldehyde .",
    "this is readily explained by the chemistry as hydrogen sulfide is directly obtained from dissociative recombination of h@xmath3s@xmath5 and involves a succession of ion molecule reactions . in the case of formaldehyde and thioformaldehyde , neutral reactions involving ch@xmath3 and atomic oxygen and atomic sulfur",
    "are supposed to occur at a rate of 1.4@xmath710@xmath57 .",
    "then , deuterium enhancement of h@xmath0co and h@xmath0cs reflects directly the deuterium enhancement of ch@xmath3 .",
    "the reaction of ch@xmath3 and o has only been studied in the laboratory down to 300 k and the reaction rate coefficient with sulfur is taken from the chemical network of the ohio state university in the group of e. herbst .    as can be seen from the table 9",
    ", this gas phase chemical model gives the correct orders of magnitude of the deuterium fractionation of ammonia , hco@xmath5 , n@xmath0h@xmath5 for the high densities and large depletion factors when comparing to the observed values .",
    "in this model grains play a passive role , as they have trapped an important fraction of carbon and oxygen , allowing the gas phase chemical processes to proceed .",
    "we also give the fractional abundances of formaldehyde , sulfur hydride and thioformaldehyde to check the relevance of our gas phase chemical network .",
    "we note that the fractional abundance of sulfur hydride is between 10@xmath58 and 4@xmath710@xmath57 for the three models .",
    "this compares reasonably to the values found in tmc-1 and l134n as reported by @xcite .",
    "grain surface chemistry is often invoked for the formation of h@xmath0s as the s@xmath5 + h@xmath0 reaction is highly endothermic . in the present chemical network",
    ", sh@xmath5 is formed via s + h@xmath4 , which subsequently reacts with h@xmath0 via radiative association to produce h@xmath3s@xmath5 .",
    "h@xmath0s is then obtained from the dissociative recombination of h@xmath3s@xmath5 .",
    "the fractional abundance derived for h@xmath0cs is below the observed ones by values of a few .",
    "however , we have checked that increasing the elemental abundance of sulfur results in increasing the steady state fractional abundances of h@xmath0s and h@xmath0cs . we do not try to obtain a perfect fit with the observed values as many physical and chemical parameters are not well constrained .",
    "the present stage of agreement is nevertheless encouraging .",
    "we have carried out a comprehensive observational study in barnard 1 of the deuterated species of thioformaldehyde , together with the observation of several lines from the main isotope and from the @xmath1s isotopic substituted species . in order to compare the deuterium enhancement we have also observed formaldehyde and its deuterated species .",
    "the main results are :    \\1 ) the systematic velocity of the dense gas in barnard 1 has been determined to be 6.70@xmath170.05 km s@xmath13 from the observation of near 20 optically thin molecular lines with well known frequencies .",
    "\\2 ) the observed frequencies for hdcs , d@xmath0cs and h@xmath0c@xmath1s as well as the available laboratory data have been fit to obtain a set of molecular rotational constants allowing precise frequency determinations for these species in the millimeter domain .",
    "\\3 ) rotational temperatures and column densities for h@xmath0cs , h@xmath0co and their isotopes have been derived from rotational diagrams or through the use of a lvg code .",
    "the derived h@xmath0cs / hdcs and h@xmath0cs / d@xmath0cs abundance ratios are @xmath63 and 9 respectively , while for formaldehyde are @xmath67 and 13 .",
    "\\4 ) steady state gas phase chemical models including multiply deuterated species and with appropriate depletion factors , such as those found in different dense cores , allow to reproduce the deuterium fractionation approximately . in this context , surface processes have not to be included specifically , as they are poorly known , and their role is essentially passive as the abundant oxygen , co , h@xmath0o ... components are frozen on the grains and are not available for gas phase chemical processes to proceed .",
    "our results involve also some specific chemical assumptions which contribute to the high deuterium fractionation , namely ( 1 ) specific branching ratios in dissociative recombination of deuterated molecular ions with a 1:2 ratio for the ejection of h compared to d as observed in several experiments . and ( 2 ) fractionation reactions of h@xmath0co@xmath5 , h@xmath3co@xmath5 , h@xmath3s@xmath5 , h@xmath0cs@xmath5 with hd .",
    "these processes have not been studied in the laboratory nor theoretically and such studies would be very desirable . however , their influence on our results is not determinant except for the deuterium fractionation of h@xmath0s .",
