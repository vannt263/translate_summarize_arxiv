    "the phase ordering kinetics following an abrupt change of a control parameter , as for instance when a magnetic system is quenched from above to below the critical temperature , is , probably , the simplest non - equilibrium phenomenon in which interactions among elementary constituents  spins in the previous example  drive the system from disordered configurations towards an ordered state .",
    "the main feature of such evolution is the coarsening kinetics whereby initially small domains of the different equilibrium phases compete and their typical size , @xmath0 , increases in order to reduce surface tension .",
    "quite generally , this process is endowed with a dynamical scaling symmetry  @xcite that physically amounts to the statistical self - similarity of configurations visited at different times , so that the only effect of the kinetics is to increase the size of the domains preserving their morphology . using the terminology of magnetic systems , for the equal time spin - spin correlation function @xmath1 with @xmath2 , scaling implies g(r , t)=g ( ) .",
    "[ scal ] this scaling form is expected to apply at distances @xmath3 much larger than some reference length @xmath4 that is usually associated to the lattice spacing , and for times longer than some time @xmath5 that is supposed to end a non - universal transient regime where scaling does not hold yet .",
    "notice that , in principle , eq . ( [ scal ] )",
    "should be more properly written as g(r , t)= ( , ) , [ scal2 ] where the second entry regulates the presence of finite - size effects when the domains size grows comparable to the system s linear dimension @xmath6 .",
    "however , one is usually concerned with the very large system size limit @xmath7 in which the second entry in @xmath8 diverges , @xmath9 , and eq .",
    "( [ scal ] ) holds with @xmath10 .",
    "the scaling function @xmath11 goes rapidly to zero for @xmath12 , meaning that correlations have only established up to distances comparable with the typical domain size .",
    "regions occupied by the various phases grow similarly in the coarsening stage , therefore none of them prevails at any finite time if the thermodynamic limit is taken from the onset . for a magnetic system",
    "this implies that no magnetisation is developed .",
    "the discussion above applies both to clean systems and to those with quenched disorder , provided it is sufficiently weak not to destroy the ordered phase or to introduce frustration .",
    "it was shown in a number of papers @xcite that , starting from a certain time @xmath13 , some geometrical features of the growing domains in a clean two - dimensional coarsening spin system are very accurately described by the well known properties of random ( site ) percolation  @xcite at the critical threshold @xmath14 , where a fractal spanning or wrapping cluster exists .",
    "this fact comes as a surprise , since percolation is a paradigm of a non - interacting problem , whereas coarsening embodies exactly the opposite .",
    "however , although apparently paradoxical , the interactions among the spins provide the mechanism whereby percolative features are built at times of order @xmath13 .",
    "indeed , being the initial state uncorrelated , it is an instance of random percolation , and the absence of magnetisation sets the concentration of up and down spins to @xmath15 .",
    "clusters in such a state , therefore , are too thin to extend across the entire system , because @xmath16 on the square lattice used in the simulation .",
    "hence , the formation of a spanning or wrapping object at @xmath13 is certainly an effect of the ordering kinetics .",
    "quite intriguingly , in fact , as correlations stretch to larger and larger distances , the droplet structure manages to connect initially disjoint parts until the largest domain crosses the entire system and acquires the geometric properties of the percolation cluster at threshold .",
    "if @xmath17 such a domain is surely stable and persists up to the longest times ( although , obviously , some of its geometrical features change in time , as we will further discuss ) .",
    "this is indeed how @xmath13 is defined .    from @xmath18",
    "onward , phase - ordering exhibits the fractal properties of uncorrelated critical percolation on sufficiently large scales . as a matter of fact , since the magnetisation remains zero at any time , such properties occur in a correlated system with @xmath19 .",
    "these two apparently contradicting instances  uncorrelated percolation akin to the one occurring at @xmath20 on the one hand and correlated coarsening with @xmath21 on the other hand  can be actually reconciled because they occur on well separated distances : percolative properties are confined on length scales @xmath22 larger than those where , due to the interactions , some correlation has already developed . instead , on length scales @xmath23 , where the interaction is at work , the correlations compactify the fractal domains and the percolative geometry",
    "interactions , therefore , play the two contrasting roles of promoting the formation of the critical percolation cluster and of progressively destroying it at scales of order @xmath0 .",
    "this whole framework is quite clearly exhibited in the clean ( i.e. ,  non disordered ) two - dimensional kinetic ising model with single spin - flip dynamics for which @xmath13 was shown to scale with the system size @xmath6 as  @xcite t_p l^z_p [ tp ] where @xmath24 is a new dynamical exponent that depends on the properties of the lattice populated by the spins . this relation suggests the introduction of a growing length associated with the approach to critical percolation @xmath25 that saturates reaching the linear system size @xmath6 at @xmath18 , namely @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , for such non - conserved scalar order parameter dynamics , @xmath27 with @xmath28 quite generally . then @xmath29^{z_d / z_p } \\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq : rp - rd}\\ ] ] on the basis of extensive numerical simulations , it was conjectured in  @xcite that @xmath30 , the coordination of the lattice , for this kind of dynamic rule .",
    "other clean systems evolving with different microscopic rules ( local and non - local spin exchange and voter ) on various lattices are treated in  @xcite , and more details are given in this manuscript , where the guess @xmath31^n$ ] is revisited .",
    "here we use glauber dynamics that we define below . notice that @xmath26 implies r(t_p)=l^z_p / z_d .",
    "[ zpzd ]    interestingly , the existence of a percolative structure in coarsening systems is at the heart of one of the few analytical results in finite dimensional phase - ordering in two dimensions  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the distribution of cluster areas in percolation is exactly known @xcite and , since the evolution of a single hull - enclosed area in a non - conserved scalar order parameter dynamics can be inferred , an exact expression for the area distribution at any time in the scaling regime can be derived building upon the one at random percolation .",
    "as mentioned above , the relevance of percolation in phase - ordering kinetics was initially addressed in a homogeneous system without quenched disorder .",
    "real systems , on the other hand , are seldom homogeneous , due to the occurrence of lattice defects , because of position - dependent external disturbances , or for other reasons .",
    "this fact deeply perturbs the scaling properties @xcite . indeed , although some kind of symmetry comparable to eq .",
    "( [ scal ] ) is reported in some experiments @xcite , the asymptotic growth - law @xmath0 is observed to be much slower than in a clean system @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions are reached in the numerical studies of models for disordered ferromagnets , such as the kinetic ising model in the presence of random external fields @xcite , with varying coupling constants @xcite , or in the presence of dilution @xcite .",
    "a natural question , then , is whether the percolation effects observed in bi - dimensional clean systems show up also in the disordered ones .",
    "the answer is not pat because our knowledge in this field is still rather scarce and even simpler questions regarding the nature of the dynamical scaling or the form of the growth law remain , in the presence of disorder , largely unanswered . in  @xcite the geometric properties of the domain areas in a coarsening ising model with weak quenched disorder",
    "were studied but the analysis of the time needed to reach the critical percolation structure and the detailed evolution during the approach to this state were not analyzed . in this article we settle this issue . by means of extensive numerical simulations of the kinetics of both the random field ising model ( rfim ) and the random bond ising model ( rbim ) we clearly show the existence , starting from a certain time @xmath13 , of a spanning cluster with the geometry of critical percolation . not only this feature is akin to what was observed in the clean system , but also other quantitative properties , such as the size - dependence ( [ tp ] ) of the characteristic time @xmath13 and many other details , which all turn out to be exactly reproduced in the presence of disorder as they are in its absence .",
    "this qualifies the relation between coarsening and percolation as a robust phenomenon whose origin is deeply rooted into the physics of order - disorder transitions in two dimensions . besides interesting and informative on their own , the results of this paper also represent a step towards a theory of phase - ordering in two - dimensional disordered ferromagnets , in the same spirit of the one developed  @xcite for clean systems .",
    "needless to say , this would represent an important achievement in such a largely unsettled field .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ themodel ] we introduce the model that will be considered throughout the paper and the basic observables that will be computed . in sec .",

    "[ concl ] by summarising the results and discussing some issues that remain open .",
    "we will consider a ferromagnetic system described by the hamiltonian ( \\{s_i})=-_ijj_ijs_is_j+_i h_is_i , [ isham ] where @xmath32 are ising spin variables defined on a two - dimensional @xmath33 square lattice ( different lattices were considered in  @xcite ) and @xmath34 are two nearest neighbor sites .",
    "the properties of the coupling constants @xmath35 and of the external field @xmath36 , specified below , define the two disordered models that will be studied in this paper .",

    "* rfim : * in this model the ferromagnetic bonds are fixed @xmath42 ( i.e. @xmath43 ) , while the external field @xmath44 is uncorrelated in space and sampled from a symmetric bimodal distribution .    the ordered state , typical of the clean system below the critical temperature @xmath45 , is preserved in the rbim because the randomness of the coupling constants maintains them all ferromagnetic .",
    "something else occurs in the rfim , because the external fields efficiently contrast the ordering tendency down to @xmath46 in any @xmath47 .",
    "this is easily explained by the imry ma argument @xcite which , upon comparing the energy increase @xmath48 due to the reversal of a bubble of size @xmath49 in an ordered phase , to its decrease @xmath50 due to the possible alignment of its spins with the majority of the random fields , shows the existence of a threshold length _",

    "dynamics can be introduced in the ising model with hamiltonian ( [ isham ] ) by flipping single spins according to glauber transition rates at temperature @xmath56 w(s_i - s_i)=[trate ] where the local weiss field h^w_i=_jnn(i)j_ijs_j = j_0_jnn(i)s_j+_jnn(i)_ijs_j= h_i , det^w+h_i , rand^w , is decomposed , for the rbim , into a deterministic and a random part ( the sum runs over the nearest neighbours @xmath57 of @xmath58 ) .",
    "the quenching protocol amounts to evolve a system prepared at time @xmath59 in an uncorrelated state with zero magnetisation  representing an equilibrium configuration at @xmath60  by means of spin flips regulated by the transition rates ( [ trate ] ) evaluated at the final temperature @xmath61 of the quench .",
    "in this paper we focus on the limit @xmath62 while keeping finite the ratio @xmath63 ( for the rbim ) or @xmath64 ( for the rfim ) .",

    "let us consider a quench of the clean ising model to @xmath76 .",
    "the wrapping cluster that develops around @xmath13 can cross the system in different ways .",
    "the first possibility is to span the system from one side to the other horizontally or vertically .",

    "another possibility is to have a domain traversing the sample in both the horizontal and the vertical direction , the probability of which we indicate @xmath101 .",
    "finally , clusters can percolate along one of the two diagonal directions with equal probabilities @xmath102 and @xmath103 . since we operate with periodic boundary conditions , other wrapping shapes  winding the torus more than once  are also possible but these will not be considered in the following since they occur with an extremely small probability .",
    "the quantities mentioned above are exactly known for two - dimensional critical percolation .",

    "the last quantity that we will consider is the winding angle , that is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_wind ] ( the clean case corresponds to the black lines with circles , which are perfectly superimposed to the others ) , for various choices of @xmath0 .    following the discussion relative to the connectivity , for @xmath135 we expect to observe the percolative behavior of eq .",

    "if this is true we ought to find data collapse of the curves for @xmath136 at different times upon plotting them against @xmath77 , if @xmath119 is large enough and @xmath137 ( similarly to what previously observed for @xmath121 , see fig .",

    "( [ windcoars ] ) for @xmath3 sufficiently larger than @xmath0 .",
    "this kind of plot is shown in fig .",

    "interestingly , not only we observe data collapse on the mastercurve ( [ windcoars ] ) when @xmath95 , but this occurs with good precision also for a value @xmath126 which was shown in fig .",

    "this implies that , for this particular quantity , a single parameter scaling ^2(r , t ) = t ( ) , [ scaltheta ] where @xmath139 is a scaling function , accounts for the data .",
    "this does not contradict the general fact that  due to the existence of the extra - length @xmath74  a two - parameter scaling has to be expected . indeed",
    "( [ scaltheta ] ) is a particular case of a two - parameter form ^2(r , t ) = ^2 ( , ) , where @xmath140 is a scaling function with a weak dependence on the second entry .      in this section",
    "we will discuss the effects of quenched disorder on the approach to percolation by considering the dynamics of the rfim and the rbim .",
    "we will investigate the properties of the same quantities analyzed in the clean limit in sec .",
    "[ pure ] .    before starting this analysis",
    "let us briefly overview what is known about the coarsening behavior of weakly disordered models . when weak disorder is added , the growth law @xmath0 is markedly slowed down with respect to its growth in the pure case .",
    "this is observed in the rfim and in the rbim as well . in particular ,",
    "in the low temperature limit we are considering in this paper ( i.e. @xmath141 with fixed @xmath67 , see the discussion around eq .",
    "( [ simplrates ] ) ) , after a microscopic time , a regime in which an effective algebraic law , @xmath142 , is entered .",
    "the effective growth exponent , starting from the value @xmath143 of the clean case , monotonously increases with @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "this shows that in this stage @xmath0 grows slower in the disordered models than in the clean case .",
    "all these features are quite neatly observed in fig .",
    "[ fig_rt ] , where the behavior of @xmath0 is shown . at rather long times , for @xmath144 , a crossover occurs to an even slower growth , with @xmath0 increasing logarithmically , representing the asymptotic behavior  @xcite .",
    "the simulations presented in this paper will never enter such an asymptotic stage , they will be restricted to @xmath145 .",
    "the slowing down of @xmath0 reflects a fundamental difference in the coarsening mechanisms at @xmath146 and @xmath147 . in the clean system phase - ordering proceeds by softening and flattening of interfaces , which is promoted by surface tension and is a non - thermal effect .",
    "this means that activated processes are irrelevant and , as a consequence , the kinetics has the same basic features at any @xmath148 , including @xmath76 ( which is indeed the case presented in the previous section ) . on the other hand , as soon as some disorder  no matter how small  is present , interfaces get stuck in pinned configurations and the evolution can only be promoted by thermal activation .",
    "these systems are frozen at @xmath76 ( this is why we work at finite , although vanishing small , temperatures @xmath149 ) .",
    "the basic result of this section is that , despite the dynamics in the presence of disorder being fundamentally different from the ones of the pure case , notwithstanding the fact that @xmath0 increases in a radically different way , the percolative features observed in the clean case occur with the same qualitative and quantitative modality in the presence of disorder .",
    "moreover , this occurs both for random fields and random bonds .    in order to prove the statement in the previous paragraph ,",
    "let us start by discussing the behaviour of the crossing probabilities introduced at the beginning of sec .",
    "these quantities are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_probcross ] .",
    "for both the rfim and the rbim and for any strength of disorder considered parametrized by @xmath67 these probabilities are basically indistinguishable from those of the clean @xmath146 case .",
    "this shows that the effect of disorder does not spoil the occurrence of the percolative structure , nor how and when ( provided time is parametrized in terms of @xmath75 ) it is formed . as a byproduct",
    ", the independence of the crossing probabilities on @xmath150 implies that eq .",
    "( [ zpzd ] ) is valid beyond the pure case with a unique value of the exponent @xmath151 , at least for the non - conserved order parameter dynamics on the square lattice considered here .",
    "let us mention that , since @xmath0 is strongly @xmath67-dependent , we should not find the nice collapse of fig .",
    "[ fig_probcross ] if we plotted against time , instead of against @xmath0",
    ". equation  ( [ zpzd ] ) would not look @xmath67-independent upon expressing @xmath74 as a function of time either , namely in the form of eq .",
    "( [ tp ] ) .",
    "this shows that the typical size of correlated domains is the natural parametrization of time in this problem .",
    "it will also help us conclude about the system size dependence of the percolation time @xmath13 without having to simulate different system sizes , as we will explain below .",
    "let us move on to the connectedness function . a comparison between the clean case and the disordered ones is presented in fig .  [ fig_connect ] . in this figure",
    "one sees that all the disordered cases fall onto the clean case provided that times are chosen in order to have the same growing length .",
    "for instance , the curve for @xmath152 without disorder is indistinguishable from the one at @xmath153 for the rbim with @xmath154 , because at these times the size @xmath0 of the domains in the two models is the same , @xmath155 ( last curve on the top in fig .",
    "[ fig_connect ] ) .",
    "notice that collapse of the various curves is obtained for the rfim and the rbim , and for any strength @xmath67 of disorder .",
    "this confirms that the way in which the percolation structure develops , and the scaling properties associated to that , are those discussed in the previous section regarding the clean case , and are largely independent of the presence of disorder .",
    "finally , we arrive at the same conclusion by considering the winding angle .",
    "this quantity is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_wind ] where the clean system and different disordered cases are shown . as in fig .",
    "[ fig_connect ] , the comparison is made by choosing times so as to have the same @xmath0 . also in this case one observes an excellent superposition of all curves , further supporting the conclusion that the presence of disorder does not modify the percolative properties observed in the clean case . as a byproduct ,",
    "this also mean that a scaling plot like the one presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_wind2 ] for the pure case would look the same if data for the disordered models were used .",
    "this implies that the scaling properties discussed in the previous section for the winding angle apply in the presence of quenched disorder as well .",
    "the same holds for the connectedness function .    as a final important point ,",
    "let us discuss the role of the crossover time @xmath156 where the growth law turns to a logarithmic form .",
    "as we said at the beginning of this section , our simulations do not even approach times of the order @xmath156 . however , the existence of this crossover time is associated to a further characteristic length @xmath157 which might be relevant to the scaling properties discussed in sec .",
    "indeed , considering the connectedness function for example , the dependence on @xmath158 is expected to enter a scaling form in the following way c(r , t)=c ( , , ) , [ scalc2par ] where for simplicity we use the same symbol @xmath112 also for this new , three entry , scaling function . clearly , since in the range of times considered in our simulations we have @xmath159 , and consequently @xmath160 , the last entry in the above equation is always around zero and can be neglected .",
    "this , in turn , makes our results independent of disorder @xmath150 , as we have already discussed , a fact that has been called _ superuniversality _ @xcite .",
    "notice that this does not mean that disorder is ineffective , since the growth law @xmath0 changes dramatically due to the quenched randomness .",
    "however , it is quite natural to expect that such insensitivity of @xmath112 on @xmath150 could be spoiled if times where pushed to such late regimes as to give @xmath161 . in this case",
    "the last entry in eq .",
    "( [ scalc2par ] ) could start , in principle , to play a role , introducing an @xmath150-dependence and spoiling the superuniversality we have shown to hold in the regime accessed in our simulations .",
    "the investigation of such a late regime requires a huge numerical effort that is beyond the scope of this paper and remains a challenge for future research .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the relevance of percolative effects on the phase - ordering kinetics of the two - dimensional ising model quenched from the disordered phase to a very low final temperature .",
    "we have considered the clean case as a benchmark , and two forms of quenched randomness , random bonds and random fields .",
    "the presence and the properties of the percolation cluster have been detected by inspection of quantities , such as the pair - connectedness , that represent an efficient tool to detect the percolative wrapping structure hidden in the patchwork of growing domains .",
    "the main finding of this paper is that the addition of weak quenched randomness , while sensibly changing the speed of the ordering process , does not impede the occurrence of percolation , nor it changes the way in which it sets in , even at a quantitative level .",
    "indeed , we find that quantities such as the wrapping probabilities , the connectivity function and the winding angle behave in the same way with great accuracy for any choice of the disorder strength , including the clean case , once time has been measured in units of the size @xmath0 of the ordered regions .",
    "all the above can be accounted for in a scaling framework where coarsening , percolation and disorder are associated to three characteristic lengths , @xmath75 , @xmath74 , and @xmath158 respectively , and the interplay between them depends on how such lengths compare between them and with the linear system size .    the results in  @xcite and in this paper show that the relevance of percolation , which was previously pointed out for @xmath92 clean systems , extends to the much less understood realm of disordered systems , making this issue of a quite general character .",
    "this not only opens the way to further studies on more general disordered systems ( for instance , randomly diluted models where a more complex scaling structure has been recently observed @xcite ) , but also prompts the attention on a possible generalisation of analytical theories where the properties of phase - ordering are traced back to percolation effects , originally developed for clean systems , to the disordered cases .",
