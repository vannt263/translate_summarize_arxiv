    "the coulomb interaction between electrons in solids leads to a virtually unlimited variety of phenomena , such as magnetic correlations and magnetic order , high - temperature superconductivity , metal - insulator transitions , phase separation and stripes , and the formation of exotic quantum liquid phases .",
    "the latter include luttinger liquids , quantum critical points , and fractional quantum hall states .",
    "interacting electron systems usually exhibit very distinct behavior on different energy scales .",
    "composite objects and collective phenomena emerge at scales far below the bare energy scales of the microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "for example , in cuprate high - temperature superconductors one bridges three orders of magnitude from the highest scale , the bare coulomb interaction , via the intermediate scale of short - range magnetic correlations , down to the lowest scale of @xmath0-wave superconductivity and other ordering phenomena ( see fig .",
    "[ htscscales ] ) .",
    "this diversity of scales is a major obstacle to a straightforward numerical solution of microscopic models , since the most interesting phenomena emerge only at low temperatures and in systems with a large size .",
    "it is also hard to deal with by conventional many - body methods , if one tries to treat all scales at once and within the same approximation , for example by summing a subclass of feynman diagrams .",
    "perturbative approaches which do not separate different scales are plagued by infrared divergences , and are therefore often inapplicable even at weak coupling , especially in low dimensions .",
    "it is thus natural to treat degrees of freedom with different energy scales successively , descending step by step from higher to lower scales .",
    "this is the main idea behind the _ renormalization group _ ( rg ) .",
    "renormalization group methods have a long tradition in the theory of interacting fermi systems .",
    "already in the 1970s , various versions of the rg have been used to deal with infrared singularities arising in one - dimensional fermi systems @xcite .",
    "naturally , the rg was also applied to ( mostly bosonic ) effective field theories describing critical phenomena at continuous classical or quantum phase transitions in interacting fermi systems @xcite .",
    "renormalization group approaches dealing with interacting fermions in arbitrary dimensions @xmath0 have been developed much later . due to the extended ( not point - like ) geometry of the fermi surface singularity in dimensions @xmath1",
    ", the renormalization group flow can not be reduced to a finite number of running couplings . however , the main reason for the delayed development of a comprehensive rg approach for interacting fermi systems in higher dimensions was probably not this difficulty , but rather a lack of motivation .",
    "the few infrared singularities appearing in three - dimensional fermi systems could usually be handled by simple resummations of perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "triggered by the issue of non - fermi liquid behavior in two - dimensional systems , and the related discussion on the validity of perturbation theory , systematic rg approaches to interacting fermi systems in arbitrary dimensions have been developed by various groups in the early 1990s .",
    "aiming at a mathematical control of interacting fermi systems , @xcite , and independently @xcite , have formulated a rigorous fermionic version of wilson s momentum - shell rg @xcite .",
    "important rigorous results have indeed been obtained in one - dimensional @xcite and two - dimensional @xcite systems .",
    "the essential message from these results is that no hitherto unknown instabilities or non - perturbative effects occur in fermi systems with sufficiently weak short - range interactions , at least in the absence of special features such as van hove singularities at the fermi level .",
    "the wilsonian rg for interacting fermi systems was popularized among ( non - mathematical ) physicists by @xcite and @xcite , who presented some of the main ideas in a pedagogical style . in particular",
    ", they provided an intuitive rg perspective of fermi liquid theory .",
    "subtleties associated with the singularities of the interaction vertex for forward scattering were clarified a bit later @xcite .",
    "a hamiltonian - based rg interpretation of fermi liquid theory was presented by @xcite , who discussed not only translation invariant systems but also models for magnetic impurities in metals .    as an alternative to the wilsonian rg",
    "one may also use flow equations for hamiltonians based on infinitesimal unitary transformations , which make the hamiltonian successively more diagonal @xcite .",
    "this approach has been used successfully for quantum impurity models and other systems @xcite .",
    "a weak coupling truncation of the flow equations has been applied to identify instabilities of the two - dimensional hubbard model @xcite .",
    "there is much current interest in rg methods for correlated fermions in non - equilibrium .",
    "the perturbative rg @xcite , wilson s numerical rg @xcite , as well as wegner s flow equation approach @xcite were extended to non - equilibrium , and real - time rg methods were developed @xcite .",
    "the wilsonian rg is not only useful for a deeper and partially even rigorous understanding of interacting fermion systems . a specific version of wilson s rg known as _ exact _ or _ functional _ rg turned out to provide a valuable framework for computational purposes .",
    "approximations derived from exact functional flow equations have played an increasingly important role in the last decade .",
    "these developments are the central topic of this review .",
    "exact flow equations describe the evolution of a generating functional for all many - particle green or vertex functions as a function of a flow parameter @xmath2 , usually an infrared cutoff .",
    "they can be derived relatively easily from a functional integral representation of the generating functional .",
    "exact flow equations have been known since the early years of the rg , starting with the work of @xcite . @xcite",
    "employed an exact flow equation to formulate a relatively simple proof of renormalizability of the @xmath3-theory in four dimensions .",
    "renormalizability proofs can be further simplified by using a wick - ordered variant of polchinski s equation @xcite .    for computational purposes the exact flow equation for the effective action , first derived in the context of bosonic field theories by @xcite turned out to be most convenient .",
    "the effective action @xmath4 $ ] is the generating functional for one - particle irreducible vertex functions .",
    "the latter are obtained by taking derivatives with respect to the source field @xmath5 .",
    "the flow parameter @xmath2 describes a regularization of the underlying bare action , which regularizes infrared divergencies in perturbation theory .",
    "the regularization is removed at the end of the flow , say for @xmath6 . the initial regulator ( for @xmath7 )",
    "can be chosen such that @xmath8 $ ] is given by the bare action .",
    "the flow of @xmath4 $ ] then provides a smooth interpolation between the bare action of the system and the final effective action @xmath9 $ ] , from which any desired information can be extracted .",
    "this flow is determined by an exact functional differential equation @xcite .",
    "expanding in the fields one obtains a hierarchy of flow equations for the one - particle irreducible vertex functions .",
    "the advantage of that hierarchy compared to others , obtained , for example , from polchinski s equation , is that self - energy feedback is included automatically and no one - particle reducible terms appear .",
    "the expression _ functional _ rg stems from the feature that the exact flow equations describe the flow of a functional or ( equivalently ) of a hierarchy of functions .",
    "an important difference compared to wilson s original formulation is that a complete set of source fields is kept in the flowing generating functionals , not only those corresponding to scales below @xmath2 .",
    "hence , the full information on the properties of the system remains accessible , not only the low energy or long wavelength behavior .",
    "exact flow equations can be solved exactly only in special cases , where the underlying model can also be solved exactly ( and more easily ) by other means . however , the functional rg is a valuable source for devising powerful new approximation schemes , which can be obtained by truncating the hierarchy and/or by a simplified parametrization of the green or vertex functions .",
    "these approximations have several distinctive advantages : i ) they have a renormalization group structure built in , that is , scales are handled successively and infrared singularities are thus treated properly ; ii ) they can be applied directly to microscopic models , not only to effective field theories which capture only some asymptotic behavior ; iii ) they are physically transparent , for example one can see directly how and why new correlations form upon lowering the scale ; iv ) one can use different approximations at different scales .",
    "small steps from a scale @xmath2 to a slightly smaller scale @xmath10 are much easier to control than an integration over all degrees of freedom in one shot , and one can take advantage of the flexibility provided by the choice of a suitable flow parameter .",
    "approximations derived from exact flow equations have been applied in many areas of quantum field theory and statistical physics @xcite . in the context of interacting fermi systems ,",
    "functional rg methods were first used for an unbiased stability analysis of the two - dimensional hubbard model @xcite . since then , approximations derived within the functional rg framework have been applied to numerous interacting fermion systems .",
    "this review provides a thorough introduction to the functional rg in the context of interacting fermi systems .",
    "it should serve as a manual and reference for many - body theorists who wish to apply approximations based on the functional rg to their own problem of interest .",
    "we will first describe the functional rg framework and derive in particular the exact flow equations , which are the starting point for approximations .",
    "we will discuss general aspects related to the flow equations such as the choice of cutoffs , power counting and truncations .",
    "links to the use of flow equations in the mathematical literature will be pointed out along the way .",
    "we will then review some of the most interesting applications of truncated functional rg equations ( see table of content ) .",
    "our aim is not to deliver an exhaustive overview of all applications , but rather to show via selected applications how the functional rg method can be fruitfully used .",
    "the functional rg was recently extended to fermi systems out of equilibrium @xcite . in the derivation of the flow equations in sec .",
    "ii we restrict ourselves to the equilibrium formalism . functional rg flow equations for non - equilibrium keldysh green and vertex functions can be derived in close analogy @xcite .",
    "the necessary extensions are briefly mentioned when discussing the application of this method to finite bias steady state transport through correlated quantum wires and quantum dots in sec .",
    "a number of reviews with a focus on the functional rg are already available .",
    "mathematically rigorous developments until the end of the last millenium were summarized in a book by @xcite , a large portion of which is dedicated to interacting fermi systems .",
    "examples of approximations derived from the exact flow equation for the effective action with many applications in quantum field theory and statistical physics were presented in the review article by @xcite .",
    "a detailed introduction to the functional rg in a textbook style supplemented by selected applications ( including fermi systems ) can be found in the recent book by @xcite .",

    "assuming that @xmath1268 , this bound is always saturated for @xmath1269 , and also for those @xmath23 for which the shift by @xmath23 makes the two shells overlap over a significant region of the fermi surface , that is , when @xmath23 is a nesting vector of the fermi surface .",
    "for other values of @xmath23 , the intersection volume can be much smaller than that of @xmath1264 .",
    "a general definition of non - nesting was given , and power counting bounds were derived when it is satisfied , by @xcite , and extended to the case with van hove singularities in @xcite .",
    "here we only cite the result for the case of a strictly convex and positively curved fermi surface without van hove singularities , discussed also in the appendix of @xcite . in that case , and for @xmath1270 , one can show that the volume ratio @xmath1271 is proportional to @xmath1272 here @xmath1273 is the smallest value of @xmath1274 on the fermi surface , @xmath1275 is a @xmath1276-neighbourhood of the set @xmath1277 ( note that @xmath1278 is taken modulo reciprocal lattice vectors ) , and @xmath1038 denotes the minimal curvature on the fermi surface .",
    "this is illustrated for @xmath1279 in fig .",
    "[ fig : schnitte ] . in the first case , the intersection is transversal , which decreases the intersection volume by the factor in ( [ transversal ] ) .",
    "the second case corresponds to a @xmath1280-intersection , where the curvature in a region of size @xmath1281 determines the intersection volume , corresponding to ( [ 2kf ] ) . in the third case",
    ", @xmath1282 is so small that the volume of the intersection is essentially equal to that of @xmath1264 .",
    "the scale in the flow where the improvements set in is determined by the curvature of the fermi surface , because there is really only an improvement if the additional factors are smaller than one . in cases where the curvature is small on large parts of the fermi surface , as in the hubbard model near to half - filling and at small next - to - nearest hopping , one thus has an effective nesting at those scales and at those @xmath23 where the quotients in ( [ transversal ] ) and ( [ 2kf ] ) are so big that they give a bound that is bigger than the trivial bound @xmath322 for the volume ratio .",
    "( [ transversal ] ) and ( [ 2kf ] ) imply that for small @xmath1282 , @xmath1283 ( where the constant depends on the curvature of the fermi surface ) and that the function remains bounded for @xmath1282 not close to zero ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , for convex curved fermi surfaces , the four - point function can diverge only at @xmath1269 and there , only logarithmically ( by a similar argument , one can see that it can diverge only at @xmath425 ) .",
    "the particle - particle correction to the vertex function has exactly this behaviour . in the particle - hole term",
    ", there is an additional sign cancellation that removes the logarithm .",
    "the same argument shows that in general , divergences can occur only at nesting vectors of the fermi surface .",
    "an extension of these geometric estimates to two - loop integrals of the type @xmath1284 is very useful for @xmath203 : it is shown in @xcite that in absence of nesting and van hove singularities , such integrals contain a scaling improvement independently of @xmath23 .",
    "such two - loop integrals associated to graphs with overlapping loops arise when the rg equation gets iterated ; the graph classification of @xcite shows that in a precise sense , the overwhelming majority of graphs in the feynman graph expansion contains one or even two such subintegrals , hence becomes subleading at low scales .",
    "as is explained in detail in @xcite , in absence of nesting and van hove singularities , this justifies the particle - particle - ladder aproximation , it singles out the hartree - fock type contributions to the self - energy by scaling arguments , and it allows to show that the derivative of the self - energy is rg - irrelevant instead of marginal ."
