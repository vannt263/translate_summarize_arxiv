    "the aim of this article is to relate two generalizations of the burau representation of the braid groups to certain types of tangles . consider the standard presentation of the braid group in @xmath1 strands @xmath2    the _ unreduced _ burau representation @xmath3 is defined on the free @xmath4$]-module of rank @xmath1 , given by the homomorphism @xmath5^n):\\,\\sigma_i\\mapsto { { \\mathcal b}_{n } } ( \\sigma_i)=\\beta_i\\,.\\ ] ]    here the burau matrices @xmath6 and their inverses , denoting @xmath7 , are defined as @xmath8\\oplus { \\mathbbm{1}}_{n - i - 1 } \\quad \\mbox{,}\\quad   \\beta_i^{-1}={\\mathbbm{1}}_{i - 1}\\oplus \\left[\\begin{array}{cc } 0 & \\overline t\\\\ 1&(1 - \\overline t)\\\\   \\end{array}\\right]\\oplus { \\mathbbm{1}}_{n - i - 1}\\,.\\ ] ]    r45 mm        there are various generalizations of the burau representation from braids to tangles .",
    "to explain these recall first the usual category of oriented tangles , denoted by @xmath9 , whose objects are tuples of signs @xmath10 writing @xmath11 .",
    "a morphisms @xmath12 is an equivalence classes of oriented tangle diagrams in @xmath13 $ ] with endpoints @xmath14 at the bottom of the diagram and @xmath15 at the top so that the orientation is upwards at the @xmath16-th positions if @xmath17 and downwards if @xmath18 .",
    "the equivalences are given by isotopies and the usual reidemeister moves .",
    "we denote by @xmath19 the array of length @xmath1 with all + entries , which implies that the orientations of all strands at this objects ( either as source or target ) must be pointing upwards .",
    "a string link is a tangle class @xmath20 with precisely @xmath1 interval components each of which has one endpoint @xmath21 at the bottom and the other endpoint @xmath22 at the top of the diagram .",
    "see figure  [ fig : ex_strlk ] for an example of a string link @xmath23 on two strands .",
    "string links form a monoid @xmath24 with respect to the composition in @xmath9 so that we have the following inclusions of monoids : @xmath25      in @xcite lin , tian , and wang consider a generalization of @xmath26 to @xmath24 which is inspired by a remark vaughan jones in his seminal paper @xcite , where he offers a probabilistic interpretation of the burau representation . the description there is in terms of a bowling ball that runs along an arc in a braid diagram following its orientation . at positive crossings",
    "the ball drops from an overcrossing strand to an undercrossing strand with probability @xmath27 and remains on the overcrossing strand with probability @xmath28 .",
    "r38 mm        the situation is illustrated in figure  [ fig : cross_jump ] .",
    "an analogous rule is used for negative crossings in which @xmath28 is replaced by @xmath7 , see figure  [ fig : x_opp_jump ] , so that `` probabilities '' should rather be understood as weights whose values are allowed to be outside of the unit interval . assuming the pictured strands are the @xmath29-th and @xmath30-st strands in a braid presentation on @xmath1 strands the markov transition matrix from the array of probabilities just above the crossing to one just below is given by the unreduced burau matrices in ( [ eq - buraum ] ) .",
    "the construction in @xcite extends the idea of weighted paths along an oriented string link diagram with the same rule as in figure  [ fig : cross_jump ] . as opposed to braid diagrams it is possible to encounter loops and thus infinite numbers of paths between two endpoints .",
    "it is shown that for @xmath28 sufficiently close to 1 the resulting series of weights converge .",
    "for example , the diagram in figure  [ fig : ex_strlk ] contains a loop of combined weight @xmath31 and associated geometric series @xmath32 .",
    "the combined transition matrix in this example is given as @xmath33\\,.\\ ] ]    it is shown in @xcite that the resulting transition matrix will always have rational functions in @xmath28 as entries .",
    "the functorial nature of the construction , see lemma  [ lm - basicsltw ] below , further implies a homomorphism of monoids @xmath34 which restricts to @xmath26 on the braid group @xmath3 .",
    "the main result of this paper will also extend to the exterior powers of this representation @xmath35    the construction of the random walk invariant in @xcite has been applied to studies of the jones polynomial and its relation to the alexander polynomial in @xcite and has been generalized in @xcite .",
    "a second generalization to the entire category of oriented tangles is given in section 3.3 of ohtsuki s book @xcite as operator invariants a tangles associated to the alexander polynomial .",
    "the matrices assigned to generating tangles there have entries in the ring of laurent polynomials in @xmath36 for suitable basis .",
    "the construction can thus be summarizes as a functor @xmath37-{\\rm fmod}\\ ] ]    from the tangle category to the category of free @xmath38$]-modules .",
    "the assignment on objects is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the free @xmath38 $ ] module of rank 2 generated by elements @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the dual module with dual basis @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , @xmath45 is easily seen to be a tensor functor with respect to the tensor product on @xmath9 defined by the usual juxtaposition .    as described in section 4.5 of @xcite",
    "the tangle functor may be derived from the representation theory of the quantum group @xmath46 following the methods originally introduced by reshetikhin and turaev @xcite .",
    "one implication of this observation , which can also be checked directly , is that for a tangle @xmath47 the operator @xmath48 preserves a natural grading on the the modules induced , for example , by @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "for example , the module assigned to the object of length @xmath1 with all positive orientations decomposes , as free @xmath38$]-modules , into its invariant graded components as follows : @xmath52    a consequence of this decomposition is that the representation of @xmath24 on @xmath53 implied by the inclusion in ( [ eq - incls ] ) yields a series of representations as follows : @xmath54    we note that @xmath55 is of rank one so that we may write @xmath56 as a well - defined polynomial - valued invariant .",
    "we will see in lemma  [ lm - t=1of ] that its specialization at @xmath57 is one for all string links so that @xmath58 also as an element in @xmath59 .",
    "we can therefore define representations of the string monoid as follows .",
    "@xmath60    it is shown in @xcite that the restriction of @xmath1-dimensional representation @xmath61 to the braid group is , up to a universal rescaling of generators , equivalent to the unreduced burau representation @xmath26 from ( [ eq - buraur ] ) .    an closely related approach of constructing tangles invariants associated to the burau representation and alexander polynomial makes use of the quantum groups @xmath62 , see for example @xcite",
    ".      in view of the dominance of algebraically constructed functorial invariants it is natural to ask whether the representation @xmath63 is really a special case of these . among the obstacles in an identification",
    "is the peculiar analytic flavor of the construction involving geometric series .",
    "particularly , the role of the denominators that are obtained by summing these series is , as for example @xmath64 in ( [ eq - ltwstr - exs ] ) , are not obvious and their algebraic or topological meaning are not at all immediate from the construction .",
    "the main result of this article is to provide such algebraic interpretations in terms of an equivalence of string link representations as stated in the following theorem .",
    "[ thm - main ] the representations @xmath65 and @xmath66 of the string link monoid @xmath24 are isomorphic to each other .",
    "we note that the isomorphism will consist only of rescaling or reordering of basis vectors . in the case of @xmath67",
    "we obtain a direct formula for the string link invariant : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is given as a bijection of canonical basis vectors up to multiplication with units of @xmath59 .",
    "the denominator occurring in the random walk construction can thus also be interpreted as the zero - graded part of ohtsuki s functor .",
    "additional interpretations are suggested in section  [ ss - comm ] .",
    "an immediate implication of theorem  [ thm - main ] is that @xmath63 is dominated by finite type invariants since it is dominated by @xmath45 .",
    "this fact has been proved by more indirect means in @xcite .",
    "another consequence of theorem  [ thm - main ] is the following .",
    "[ corr - main ] suppose @xmath70 .",
    "then @xmath71 divides all @xmath72 minors of @xmath73 in @xmath59 .",
    "the original random walk construction of @xmath74 @xcite is reviewed and formalized in section  [ s - rwi ] , where it is also applied to the situation of a string link @xmath47 given as the closure of a braid @xmath75 .",
    "particularly , we obtain in proposition  [ prop - blfrm ] an expression for @xmath76 in terms of blocks of the burau matrix for @xmath75 .",
    "a consequence , stated in corollary  [ corr - ltweigen ] , is that @xmath76 admits an equilibrium state that is independent of @xmath47 ( and thus contains no information about @xmath47 ) .",
    "in section  [ s - rmat ] we review ohtsuki s construction of the tangle functor @xmath45 as well as the equivalence given in @xcite of the implied braid representation with the exterior algebra extension of the unreduced burau representation .",
    "the quantum trace , relevant to evaluating braid closures , is related to the natural supertrace on exterior algebras in section  [ ss - trrel ] .",
    "in addition various grading and equivariance properties are discussed .",
    "section  [ ss - proof ] contains the proofs for theorem  [ thm - main ] and corollary  [ corr - main ] after introducing several technical lemmas on relating traces , evaluations on top forms , and schur complements of block matrices in sections  [ ss - strviatop ] and [ ss - trschur ] .",
    "finally , we present additional points of view and possible further questions of study in section  [ ss - comm ] .",
    "* acknowledgment : * the first author thanks craig jackson for discussions and calculations on an early version of the conjecture that are documented in @xcite .",
    "after a brief review of the random walk construction of @xcite the main result of this section is a formula for the representation @xmath63 in proposition  [ prop - blfrm ] in terms of block matrices of a markov presentation of the string link .",
    "we will review here the construction of @xcite , formalizing the intuition in terms of random walks given in the introduction .",
    "a string link @xmath77 is an oriented tangle @xmath20 for which each component is an interval that starts at a bottom point @xmath21 and end at a top point @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "an admissible path @xmath80 in a diagram of @xmath47 is a path following the orientation of @xmath47 at each piece of the diagram . at a crossing",
    "the path must continue its direction on @xmath47 if it is along the undercrossing piece of the crossing .",
    "if the path approaches a the crossing along the overcrossing piece it may either continue in the same direction or continue on the undercrossing piece in the respective direction .",
    "in addition an admissible path needs to start at a bottom point @xmath21 and end at a top point @xmath22 .",
    "thus locally a path near a crossing may look like one of the dashed lines in figure  [ fig : cross_jump ] or [ fig : x_opp_jump ] .    for braids all admissible paths need to travel upwards so that they will pass through each crossing at most once .",
    "however , for a string link , such as the one in figure  [ fig : ex_strlk ] , admissible paths may loop through a crossing arbitrarily often so that there are infinitely many admissible paths .    r35 mm        to an admissible path @xmath80 that passes through @xmath81 crossings ( counting repetitions ) we associate a weight @xmath82 , where @xmath83 if @xmath80 approaches the @xmath84-th crossing along an undercrossing piece .",
    "if @xmath80 approaches the @xmath84-th crossing along an overcrossing piece and the crossing is positive as in figure  [ fig : cross_jump ] we set @xmath85 if @xmath80 is continuing in the same direction and @xmath86 if @xmath80 continues on the undercrossing piece . for a negative crossing as in figure  [ fig : x_opp_jump ]",
    "we assign @xmath87 if @xmath80 is continuing in the same direction and @xmath88 otherwise .",
    "we uses these to assign to the diagram of a string link @xmath20 an @xmath89 matrix @xmath90 whose @xmath91 entry is given by @xmath92 here the summation is over the set @xmath93 of all admissible paths in a diagram of @xmath47 from the point @xmath94 to @xmath95 .",
    "the entry is 0 if there is no such path .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that for @xmath28 sufficiently close to 1 the summations ( [ eq - ltwij - paths ] ) over all paths converge indeed to rational expressions in @xmath28 and that these expressions are not dependent on the diagram chosen to present a particular @xmath47 .",
    "[ lm - basicsltw ] the assignment in ( [ eq - ltwij - paths ] ) has the following basic properties :    1 .",
    "the assignment @xmath96 obeys @xmath97 , where the composite @xmath98 in @xmath9 is given by stacking @xmath47 on top of @xmath99 .",
    "2 .   when restricted to the braid group @xmath3 the assignment reduces to the burau representation as defined in ( [ eq - buraur ] ) .",
    "3 .   specializing @xmath90 to @xmath57 we obtain the matrix of the permutation @xmath100 associated to @xmath47 , that is , @xmath101 .",
    "for the first part note that at the boundary between @xmath47 and @xmath99 in @xmath98 all orientations are upwards so that no admissible path can return from @xmath47 to @xmath99 .",
    "thus any admissible path @xmath102 in @xmath98 is the composite of a path @xmath103 in @xmath99 and a path @xmath104 in @xmath47 for some @xmath16 .",
    "also the weight is clearly multiplicative @xmath105 .",
    "summation over all @xmath106 , @xmath80 , and @xmath16 thus yields the respective matrix element for @xmath107 , which is thus the matrix product as desired .",
    "as described in the introduction the assignment coincides with the burau representation on the generators so that by the previous the two repetitions coincide on all elements on @xmath3 .    for the third claim notice that all paths that change direction will have weight zero and",
    "may thus be discarded . for given indices",
    "the remaining path that run strictly along a tangle component ( preserving direction at every crossing ) will have weight one .",
    "given a braid @xmath108 thought of as an isomorphism on @xmath109 we can construct a a tangle @xmath110 by closing the last @xmath111 strands by loops as indicated in figure  [ fig : markov_pres ] .",
    "the following lemma is a nearly straightforward generalization of alexander s theorem for links with some additional attention given to orientations at the end points .",
    "a respective generalization of the markov theorem also holds but is not needed here since we are only concerned with the comparison rather than the construction of invariants .",
    "every oriented tangle @xmath110 is given as the partial closure of a braid @xmath108 for some @xmath111 ( as in figure  [ fig : markov_pres ] ) .",
    "most of the proof is nearly verbatim the same as , for example , the one in section  6.5 of @xcite .",
    "the diagram is assumed to be polygonal with vertical endpoints and a rotation point @xmath112 to the right of the diagram at mid height .",
    "we may assume that no line segments are in radial direction from @xmath112 and , using subdivision , that each segment has at most one crossing point .",
    "thus each segment is either in clockwise or counter - clockwise direction around @xmath112 .",
    "alexander trick _ is applied to every line segment in counter - clockwise direction as depicted in figure  6.4 of @xcite depending on the orientation of a possible crossing . as a result all segments will be in clockwise direction .",
    "observe that the line segments at the top and bottom end points are already in clockwise direction so that they are not affected by the algorithm . in the resulting tangle diagram we will have @xmath111 segments intersecting the horizontal line @xmath113 indicated in figure  [ fig : markov_pres ] .",
    "each of these segments can be arranged to be vertical and thus oriented downwards .",
    "to these we apply the cut and stretch process described in figure  6.3 of @xcite . as a result segments at all crossings are oriented upwards and to the left of @xmath112 so that we obtain the desired braid closure presentation .    for a given tangle @xmath114 that is the closure of a braid @xmath108 in the above fashion",

    "the dimensions of the matrices @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 are the same but all matrix entries are either 0 or 1 .",
    "[ lm - qnil ] suppose @xmath114 is a tangle that is the closure of a braid @xmath108 and which has associated matrices as in ( [ eq - bclmat ] ) .    then @xmath47 is a string link if and only if @xmath125 is nilpotent .",
    "we note first that , since @xmath125 is the block of a permutation matrix @xmath126 , it has at most one 1 in each row and each column and 0 s for all other entries .",
    "that is , it is the incidence matrix of an oriented graph @xmath127 with each vertex having at most on incoming and one outgoing edge .",
    "clearly the components of such a graph are either oriented intervals or oriented circles .",
    "thus , after reordering of the basis , the matrix can be brought into a block diagonal form with two types of blocks .",
    "the first , corresponding to interval components of @xmath127 , are nilpotent jordan blocks given by square matrices @xmath128 with @xmath129 .",
    "the second type for the circle components are cyclic @xmath72-matrices @xmath130 with @xmath131",
    "if @xmath132 and @xmath133 otherwise . hence @xmath125 is nilpotent if an only if there are no cyclic blocks .",
    "consider first a matrix block of the first nilpotent type @xmath128 . denoting canonical basis @xmath134 we have for some @xmath135 and @xmath136 with @xmath137 that @xmath138 for @xmath139 .",
    "since @xmath126 encodes which points at the bottom of @xmath75 are connect by strand to which points at the top of @xmath75 we find that the arcs at positions @xmath135 through @xmath136 are consecutively connected to each other by intervals in @xmath75 .",
    "they thus form one interval @xmath140 in @xmath47 which is starting at the @xmath136-th position at the top of @xmath75 and ending at the @xmath135-th position at the bottom of @xmath75 and intersecting @xmath113 in @xmath141 arcs .",
    "since @xmath128 and thus @xmath125 has only 0 entries in the @xmath135-th column we must have a 1 entry in the @xmath135-th column for @xmath123 in some @xmath84-th row ( with @xmath142 ) which means @xmath140 is connected to the @xmath84-th top point of the diagram for @xmath47 .",
    "similarly , since @xmath128 and thus @xmath125 has only 0 entries in the @xmath136-th row @xmath124 must have a 1 entry in the @xmath136-th row in some @xmath143-th column so that @xmath140 must be connected to the @xmath143-th start point at the bottom of the tangle diagram .",
    "thus if all matrix blocks of @xmath125 are of nilpotent type the components of all closing arcs are connected to top and end bottom points of the tangle diagram .",
    "components of @xmath47 that are disjoint from closing arcs always oriented upwards and thus also must connect to top and bottom points of the diagram .",
    "thus of @xmath125 is nilpotent @xmath47 is indeed a string link .",
    "conversely , suppose @xmath125 contains a cyclic block with @xmath144 for @xmath139 and @xmath145 .",
    "then the arcs connected at positions @xmath135 through @xmath136 are again consecutively connected by intervals of @xmath75 into one component but now the ends of the component are also connected by an interval in @xmath75 forming a closed component of @xmath47 . however , closed components are not allowed for a string link",
    ".      the following consequence of nilpotency will be useful to control geometric series occurring in the random walk picture .",

    "clearly , this is an additive function with @xmath453 and vanishes on braids , that is , the invertible elements of @xmath24 .    a further objects of study is thus the size pf the kernel of @xmath454 beyond the braid group , as well as relations of @xmath455 with the number simple loops in the random walk picture or other topological properties of string links .",
    "we finally point out the generalization of ohtsuki s functor indicated by the two - variable r - matrix provided at the end of section  4.5 in @xcite .",
    "this yields , in the same manner as before , a tangle functor from which we obtain , analogous to ( [ eq - wdefltw ] ) , a representation @xmath456^{{n\\choose j}}\\bigr)\\ ] ] on the monoid @xmath457 of _ pure _ string links . in the tangle functor picture the variables @xmath458 label representations of @xmath46 and thus fit into the framework of tqfts where the @xmath458 are interpreted as `` colors '' or `` charges '' .",
    "analogous to ( [ eq - def10quot ] ) we can also define quotient representations @xmath459 .    extending the construction of the classical gassner representation of the pure braid groups kirk , livingston , and wang obtain in @xcite a representation @xmath460 we thus conclude this article with a conjecture that naturally extends theorem  [ thm - main ] and for which we expect the proof to follow a similar strategy .",
