    "major improvements in the classical cepheid extragalactic distance scale have been obtained in the last 20 years thanks to the hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations of a number of galaxies containing both cepheids and snia out to distances of @xmath825 mpc @xcite . in the literature , the cepheid period  luminosity ( pl ) relation is often adopted in the optical bands ( v and i ) and calibrated using the relation of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) cepheid sample .",
    "however , the optical pl relations suffer from metallicity effects and , in the case of metal poor samples ( z@xmath90.01 ) , nonlinearity ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . moreover , the zero point depends on the assumed lmc distance and the slope is traditionally assumed to be universal , in spite of several investigations that find a non negligible metallicity effect @xcite .",
    "the lmc has the advantage of being quite near ( about 50 kpc ) , so that its distance has been measured using different primary distance indicators ( rr lyrae , tip of the red giant branch , red  clump , etc , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , a large sample of cepheids has been released by the micro  lensing experiments carried out in this galaxy .",
    "in particular , the last catalogue from ogle iii includes more than 3,000 objects @xcite .",
    "however , the hst galaxies with snia typically have metallicities much higher than the lmc ( z@xmath100.02 compared to z@xmath10.008 ) .",
    "the metallicity dependence of the pl relation has been largely debated in the literature both from the theoretical and the observational point of view , even if a general consensus has not been achieved yet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "nonlinear convective pulsation models also suggest a non negligible dependence on the helium content @xcite .",
    "moreover , there are suggestions that the optical pl relations in the smc and lmc are not linear over the whole period range , showing a change in the slope at periods around 10 days ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) . this does not seem to be the case for galactic cepheids @xcite .",
    "although further investigations on the nonlinearity are needed for definitive claims , lmc might not be the ideal sample to set both the slope and the zero  points of optical pl relations .",
    "on the other hand , observational and theoretical investigations suggest that in the near  infrared ( nir ) bands ( j and k ) , that are also much less affected by the reddening , both the chemical composition and nonlinearity effects are significantly reduced @xcite .",
    "another advantage of the nir bands is that , given the small pulsation amplitudes in these filters , only one epoch is sufficient to derive accurate mean magnitudes ( with an error of about 0.05 mag ) , once detections and periods are available from optical data @xcite . in this context , @xcite decided to follow - up with the wfc3-ir camera on board hst the cepheid samples discovered in seven snia hosting galaxies previously observed in the optical bands by using wfpc2 and/or acs@hst @xcite . to further minimize the uncertainties in the zero point due to the metallicity difference among lmc and metal  rich galaxies ,",
    "@xcite have chosen ngc4258 as anchor for the cepheid pl relation .",
    "in fact , this galaxy has a very accurate geometrical distance estimate , d@xmath17.2@xmath40.5 mpc ( or @xmath1129.29@xmath12 mag * ? ? ? * ) , based on the analysis of its h@xmath13o maser emission . to remove the reddening uncertainty , these authors adopt a wesenheit relation based on the combination of the three filters @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) , in the assumption that the extinction law is universal .    to properly compare our set of nonlinear convective pulsation models ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) to these recent observations",
    "we have transformed the whole framework in wfc3/hst filters .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section 2 briefly describes the theoretical framework and its physical ingredients .",
    "the multi ",
    "wavelength relations connecting periods with magnitudes and colours are presented in section 3 . in sections 4 and 5",
    "we discuss a comparison between theory and the cepheid samples observed in snia hosting galaxies . in section 6 we give new estimates of the distance moduli for these galaxies and , correspondingly , a new value for the hubble constant h@xmath0 .",
    "the conclusions close the paper .",
    "in the last 15 years , we have computed an extended set of pulsating models for masses representative of classical cepheids ( 3@xmath17m / m@xmath18@xmath1712 ) using a code originally developed by @xcite and subsequently adapted to classical cepheids by @xcite . a large range of input physical parameters has been explored in order to investigate their effect on the cepheid intrinsic properties @xcite . in particular , the adopted metallicities range from z@xmath10.0004 to z@xmath10.04 , while the helium content ( depending on the assumption on the @xmath19/@xmath20 ratio ) ranges from 0.24 to 0.34 .    with this set of nonlinear pulsational models we predict both the red and the blue boundaries of the classical instability strip ( is ) in the hertzprung  russel diagram ( log l / l@xmath18 vs log t@xmath21 ) , for each assumed chemical composition .",
    "we also build a synthetic stellar population filling the predicted is with masses in the range 3  12 m@xmath18 and with an initial mass function that follows the relation m@xmath22 . adopting theoretical evolutionary prescriptions",
    ", we can associate to each synthetic stellar mass a luminosity given by a canonical mass  luminosity relation whereas the effective temperature is randomly extracted within the is for a given luminosity level .",
    "these synthetic cepheid distributions can be transformed into the wfc3/hst photometric system . to this aim",
    ", we use the bolometric corrections for both uvis and ir channels at wfc3/hst carefully computed by s. cassisi and a. pietrinferni ( priv .",
    "comm . ) . in the following we focus on the most commonly used filters , i.e. f555w ( narrow v ) , f606w ( wide v ) ,",
    "f814w ( wide i ) and f160w ( wide h ) .",
    "the transformed scenario in the remaining filters is available upon requests . to transform theoretical luminosity and effective temperature into magnitudes and colours we have assumed an updated value for the solar bolometric magnitude m@xmath23 4.77 mag ( s. cassisi , priv .",
    "comm . ) . through regression of these synthetic populations",
    "we can finally derive multi ",
    "wavelength relations , such as the pl , the pl  colour ( plc ) and the wesenheit relations .",
    "in this section we analyse the properties of the theoretical pl , plc and wesenheit relations in the wfc3/hst photometric system with particular attention to the nir filters , given the increasing role played by both space and ground  based nir facilities .",
    "we derive the linear pl relations for the whole set of available chemical compositions whose coefficients are reported in table  [ tab1 ] . as expected , these relations become steeper and tighter when passing from optical ( f555w ) to nir ( f160w ) bands with the scatter being reduced by a factor 2 .",
    "these results confirm that nir pl relations provide more accurate results than the optical ones , as found recently for the lmc cepheids @xcite .",
    "this finding is further supported by the significant reduction of the reddening effect in these bands , as the ratio between the total to selective extinction decreases of about a factor 5 going from optical to nir filters ( r@xmath24 3.06 and r@xmath25 0.41 , derived from * ? ? ?",
    ".    given the quoted non linearity of the optical pl relations , at least for metallicity typical of the magellanic clouds , we derive the coefficients of both the quadratic relations and the linear ones ( `` broken linear '' pl ) for periods shorter and longer than 10 days ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) . as expected , with the exception of the very low  metallicity case ( z=0.0004 ) , the coefficient of the quadratic term increases by decreasing the metallicity , but the effect is almost removed in the nir bands .",
    "since a general consensus on the chemical composition effect on pl relations has not been achieved yet , the metallicity dependence contribution to the final error budget on the extragalactic distance scale is not uniquely quantified . in this context , on the basis of the relations derived in this paper , we provide new constraints to the metallicity effect .    , but using the wesenheit relations for the three colour combinations labeled in literature and using as reference the solar  like metallicity @xmath26.,width=321 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , by using our synthetic cepheid samples , we show the predicted differential distance moduli relative to the reference model set with metallicity z@xmath10.008 ( lmc ) and z@xmath10.02 ( sun ) as a function of the metal content .",
    "the distance moduli are obtained with `` broken linear '' pl relations in the labelled filters .",
    "we have distinguished three different period ranges .",
    "as expected , the effect is more significant in the optical filters .",
    "moreover , inspection of this figure suggests that the adoption of the correct reference metallicity is crucial for a significant reduction of the final error in the extragalactic distance scale . in particular , for the supersolar metallicities of the hst galaxies , the adoption of pl relations for solar metallicity reduces the error due to the metallicity effect to few percent .",
    "this evidence supports the use of pl relations calibrated on ngc 4258 as adopted by @xcite . considering this result and the period range typical of these extragalactic cepheid samples ( see below ) , in the following",
    ", we adopt the theoretical pl relations for z@xmath10.02 and y@xmath10.28 derived for log p @xmath10 1 .",
    "one of the most commonly used tool to derive cepheid distances is the wesenheit relation @xcite .",
    "this formulation has the advantage to be reddening@xmath27free by construction and to include a colour term , and in turn the temperature information , for each individual star , defining a very tight relation . in table",
    "[ tab3 ] we show some of the classical formulations together with the new recent one that combines johnson - cousin optical bands and the nir ones from wfc3/hst photometric system @xcite .",
    "these relations have been derived using the following extinction coefficients : r@xmath28=0.41 , r@xmath29=1.79 , r@xmath30=2.78 and r@xmath31=3.06 from @xcite .",
    "the predicted intrinsic dispersions are very small , as well as the metallicity effects , making these relations powerful tools for accurate distance determinations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the predicted differential distance moduli relative to the reference model set with metallicity z@xmath10.02 ( sun ) as a function of the metal content obtained using the wesenheit relations .",
    "this figure show that the metallicity effect with such relationships is very small , i.e. @xmath320.2 mag or @xmath3210% in the final value of the hubble constant h@xmath0 .",
    "as we discussed in the introduction , one of the aims of this paper is the comparison of our pulsation framework with the large cepheid sample recently observed in ngc4258 and in 8 far snia host galaxies with wfc3@hst @xcite . in order to provide new , solid , constraints to the hubble constant h@xmath0 , @xcite classified cepheids in each galaxy as _ good _ or _ rejected _ through a sigma  clipping ( at 2.5 @xmath33 ) rejection criterium with respect to the f160w  pl relation defined for ngc4258 cepheids ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "table  [ tab4 ] shows the global properties of these galaxies , namely the galaxy i d , the number of total vs _ good _ cepheids observed in each galaxy , the mean cepheid metallicity , the snia apparent magnitude and their distance modulus . for each cepheid , coordinates , period , f160w magnitude and v - i colour are available in @xcite . only for few galaxies",
    "( ngc4258 , ngc3370 , ngc3021 and ngc1309 ) optical ( v , i ) individual magnitudes are also at disposal in the literature @xcite .          in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we plot the comparison among the period distributions of the various galaxies , including the anchor galaxy ngc4258 . as well known , the cepheid samples observed by hst in very distant galaxies are affected by an observational bias both at the short and long - period end of the pl relation due to the limited observational time baseline ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] confirms that only for the anchor galaxy ngc4258 periods cover the short range @xcite , whereas for all the others the period distribution span a quite similar range ( @xmath812100 d ) , with a few significantly ultra long period cepheids in ngc4536 and ngc4038 @xcite .      in this section ,",
    "we compare our pulsation theoretical predictions to the observations . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( left panel ) we show the theoretical is compared with the cepheid distribution in ngc4258 in the magnitude ( f160w ) vs colour ( v  i ) plane .",
    "the theoretical iss for fundamental pulsators are shown for three selected chemical compositions : the solar  like z@xmath10.02;y@xmath10.28 , the helium enriched z@xmath10.02;y@xmath10.31 and the lmc ",
    "like z@xmath10.008;y@xmath10.25 .",
    "we assume the distance modulus @xmath329.29 mag by @xcite and the extinction values by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see columns 7 - 8 - 9 in table  [ tab4 ] ) .",
    "we use different symbols to indicate _ good _ ( light orange dot ) and rejected ( grey dot ) cepheids .",
    "we note that the observed cepheids show a significantly larger spread than predicted by pulsational models for the solar composition ( solid lines ) . increasing the helium abundance , the is boundaries ( dashed lines ) move towards hotter effective temperatures ( bluer colours ) .",
    "a still larger effect is found for metal  poor lmc  like cepheid is boundaries ( long - dashed lines ) . in any case , on average , the colour distribution of cepheids in ngc4258 seems to be better reproduced by the two model sets with z@xmath10.02 .",
    "this occurrence is still evident when moving to the nir pl ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , where pulsation models predict a very narrow and linear relation ( dark green lines ) .",
    "this prediction is well supported by recent nir observations of cepheids in the lmc and in our galaxy @xcite . from these observations , it is evident that , for wavelength going from @xmath81.2 ( j ) to 3.6 ( mid ir ) micron @xcite , the measured scatter of the pl relation is always less than @xmath80.12 mag .",
    "instead , a linear regression of all the data in right panel of fig.[fig4 ] ( purple lines ) provides a @xmath340.65 mag . from a further inspection of this figure",
    ", we also note that theoretical models predict a flatter slope ( @xmath352.88 ) than observed ( @xmath363.24 ) and a larger zero point ( @xmath372.81 vs @xmath382.20 ) .            in fig.s  [ fig5a]-[fig5b ]",
    "( left panel ) we show the cmd location of cepheids for each hst sample .",
    "also for these galaxies , we notice a large spread in the observed distributions when compared with the predicted is boundaries",
    ". moreover , the cepheid location is on average bluer and brighter than theoretical predictions , with the effect increasing for more distant galaxies .",
    "these blue colours have been already pointed out by @xcite for the _ extreme _ cases of ngc1309 and ngc3021 when compared with galactic cepheids .",
    "our pulsational framework suggests very blue colours only for very metal  poor and helium enriched environments .",
    "however , a large variation in the chemical abundance is not supported by recent estimates of the mean metallicity [ o / h ] in each galaxy ( see column three of table  [ tab4 ] ) .",
    "we notice that an overestimate of the reddening can not be the culprit for these blue colours , because the same trend is observed even if we do not account at all for the galactic extinction . in the right panel of the fig.s  [ fig5a]-[fig5b ] , we show the f160w pl distribution for each galaxy . as in the case of ngc4258 , in spite of the large spread of these distributions ,",
    "the agreement with theoretical f160w pl relations is quite satisfactory in particular for _ good _ cepheids ( black symbols ) .",
    "the puzzling colour / magnitude behaviour shown by cepheids could depend on the well known difficulties to perform accurate stellar photometry in crowded distant galaxies .",
    "this problem worsens as the distance increases . in particular",
    ", a possible systematic effect can be related to the blending from unresolved nearby companions ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "we have ordered the galaxies from top to bottom by increasing the distance modulus . as already observed in the f160w vs v@xmath27i plane , as the galaxy distance increase",
    ", the cepheids location in the cmd moves to bluer colours and brighter magnitudes .",
    "a similar trend for the cepheid brightness is noted in the pl plane ( right panel of fig.[fig6 ] ) . for comparison ,",
    "we have over - plotted the blue boundary of the fundamental is for @xmath39 ( lmc - like ) and the red boundary for @xmath26 ( solar - like ) to take into account a possible metallicity spread found in some of these galaxies @xcite . in this plane , the agreement between theory and observations improves thanks to a smaller dependence on reddening and uncertainties in the colour  effective temperature transformations . in the case of ngc4258 , when its metallicity spread is accounted for , the comparison with the predicted is is satisfactory .",
    "the same holds for ngc3370 , whereas the other two galaxies show a cepheid distribution that is significantly bluer than predicted , even taking into account a possible revision of their metal abundance toward @xmath40 as suggested by @xcite .",
    "there is currently no clear explanation in the literature for the blue shift observed in distant galaxies , as well as for the very large color spread displayed by all the investigated samples ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion ) . a possible contribution to this trend could be given by a blending effect with faint unresolved companion stars that is expected to increase with the galaxy distance .",
    "in this section , we derive new distance moduli for the galaxies of the sample using our set of pulsation models .",
    "although the use of the wesenheit relation is very common to derive the distance moduli and usually provides smaller errors than multi ",
