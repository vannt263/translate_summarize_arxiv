    "<S> the counterpart result for jaynes - cummings model is @xmath72 .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we investigate the case for initially excited atom . </S>",
    "<S> and we refer to our exact solution as exact model in the following discussion .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(a ) for resonant and weak coupling case , fig.[f1 ] reveals that the probability @xmath65 , for j - c model , oscillates against time , while that periodically decays and revives with damping amplitude for exact model . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([e10 ] ) and ( [ e14 ] ) show that there is an attenuation factor @xmath73 for exact model when @xmath74 , while @xmath75 for j - c model .     as a function of @xmath76 for initially excited atom with @xmath77 and @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> dotted line for j - c model , solid line for exact model.,title=\"fig : \" ] +     as a function of @xmath79 for initially excited atom with @xmath80 and @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> dotted line for j - c model , solid line for exact model.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    ( b)for small detuning and weak coupling case , fig([f2 ] ) shows that @xmath65 oscillates against time for the two model except for different amplitude and different oscillating frequency . for exact model </S>",
    "<S> , the result shows that the oscillating frequency is @xmath82 for exact model , while that is @xmath83 for j - c model .    from fig.([f3 ] ) , we could find , with the decreasing of the ratio of coupling strength to the atom transmission frequency , the difference between the j - c model and the exact model becomes smaller . </S>",
    "<S> and the result also reveals that the frequency for atom decay and recover is only dependent on the detuning @xmath82 .     as a function of @xmath79 for initially excited atom with @xmath84 and @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> dotted line for j - c model , solid line for exact model.,title=\"fig : \" ] +     as a function of @xmath76 for initially excited atom with @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> solid line for @xmath85 and dotted line for @xmath86.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    \\(c ) here , the decay behavior of an atom in strong coupling regime is discussed . for the detuning case , fig.([f4 ] ) shows that @xmath65 will periodically decrease and recover , accompanying with small amplitude rapid oscillation . as the detuning value increases , the oscillation amplitude decreases , while the oscillation frequency increases .    </S>",
    "<S> form eq.([e7 ] ) and eq.([e71 ] ) , we could find that the contribution of energy - conserving process , corresponding to rotating - wave terms @xmath87 and @xmath88 in hamiltonian , varies with frequency of @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> and that of energy - non - conserving process , corresponding to counter - rotating wave terms @xmath90 and @xmath91 in hamiltonian , varies with frequency of @xmath92 . the attenuation factor in eq.([e10 ] ) comes from the destructive superposition of the different frequency contribution associated with rotating - wave terms and counter - rotating wave terms . with the increasing of coupling strength , the contribution of virtual processes will increase and result in the decay rate obviously modified .     as a function of @xmath76 for initially unexcited atom with @xmath80 and @xmath93.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    then , we focus on the case for initially unexcited atom . for j - c model , </S>",
    "<S> the probability @xmath65 is always equal to zero , which indicates no rabi oscillation for an atom . </S>",
    "<S> however , the results for exact model is in opposition to that .    for detuning case , fig.([f5 ] ) reals </S>",
    "<S> that probability @xmath65 periodically increases and decays . </S>",
    "<S> it indicates that there is rabi oscillation for initially unexcited atom coupled with vacuum single - mode field , which is contrary to that of j - c model . from another point of view </S>",
    "<S> , this result theoretically testifies the existence of vacuum energy fluctuation . </S>",
    "<S> the numeric result also exhibits that , as the coupling strength enhances , the rabi oscillation amplitude will increases .    from above discussion , we find that @xmath65 will oscillate with damping amplitude for resonant case and there is rabi oscillation for detuning case . </S>",
    "<S> that is because spontaneous emission is inhibited if there is detuning between atomic frequency and cavity mode , and enhanced if the cavity is resonant@xcite .    in summary , we have investigated vacuum rabi oscillation of an atom coupled with single - mode cavity field exactly , and compared the results with that of j - c model .    </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the results show that , for resonant case , there is damping rabi oscillation for an atom , even in strong coupling regime , while there is rabi oscillation for an tom in j - c model . secondly , for small detuning and weak coupling case , </S>",
    "<S> the probability for the atom in excited state will oscillate against time with different frequency and amplitude from that of j - c model . </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , the results also reveal that the rabi oscillation frequency is only dependent on the detuning value , while that is dependent on both the coupling strength and the detuning value for j - c model . </S>",
    "<S> fourthly , there is rabi oscillation for initially unexcited atom coupled with vacuum single - mode field , which is contrary to that of j - c model .    on the whole </S>",
    "<S> , it exhibits that there is a significant effect on the dynamic behavior of the atom due to the counter - rotating wave interaction , even under the condition in which the rwa is considered to be justified </S>",
    "<S> . the vacuum energy fluctuation and counter - rotating wave interaction could invoke many different behaviors from that of j - c model . </S>"
