    "in the standard model , the higgs boson couples to fermions with strength @xmath7 , where @xmath8 gev is the vacuum - expectation value of the higgs field .",
    "the yukawa coupling of the higgs boson to bottom quarks ( @xmath9 gev ) is thus very weak , leading to very small cross sections for associated production of the higgs boson and bottom quarks at the fermilab tevatron ( @xmath10 tev @xmath11 ) @xcite and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc , @xmath12 tev @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "however , this yukawa coupling could be considerably enhanced in extensions of the standard model with more than one higgs doublet , thereby increasing this production cross section @xcite .",
    "for example , in a two - higgs - doublet model , the yukawa coupling of some or all of the higgs bosons ( @xmath14 ) to the bottom quark could be enhanced for large values of @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs doublet that couples to the bottom quark .",
    "the dominant subprocess for the production of a higgs boson in association with bottom quarks is bottom - quark fusion , @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bbh ] ) , to denote a generic higgs boson . in a two - higgs - doublet model",
    ", @xmath17 may denote any of the neutral higgs bosons ( @xmath18 ) . ] where the @xmath1 quarks reside in the proton sea @xcite .",
    "this is the leading - order ( lo ) subprocess for the inclusive production of the higgs boson in association with bottom quarks .",
    "since the bottom - quark sea is generated by gluons splitting into nearly - collinear @xmath19 pairs , the final state contains two spectator bottom quarks that tend to be at low transverse momentum ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "in contrast , if one requires one bottom quark at high @xmath20 from the production process , the leading - order subprocess is @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this process is particularly promising due to the ability to tag the @xmath1 quark in the final state .",

    "although this process has been the most studied , it is likely that @xmath21 is the more promising , due to its larger cross section .",
    "the inclusive cross section , @xmath0 , which we study in this paper , is useful when the higgs boson can be identified above backgrounds without the need to detect the accompanying bottom quarks that reside in the final state .",
    "this subprocess may be useful to discover a higgs boson for large @xmath6 in the decay mode @xmath23 at the tevatron and lhc @xcite and @xmath24 at the lhc @xcite .",
    "it has the advantage of having the largest cross section , since it is inclusive of the other two processes .",
    "higgs - boson production via bottom - quark fusion was calculated at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in refs .",
    "there are two puzzling aspects of the results of that calculation :    * although the nlo correction is modest , it consists of two independent corrections , of order @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which are both large ( and of opposite sign ) .",
    "this suggests that the perturbation series in each expansion parameter individually may not be well behaved .",
    "* the cross section at the tevatron ( both lo and nlo ) is an order of magnitude larger than the cross section obtained by calculating @xmath27 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ggbbh ] ) and integrating over the momenta of the final - state particles @xcite .",
    "while @xmath5 is not a reliable calculation of the total inclusive cross section , since the expansion parameter is @xmath28 rather than @xmath26 @xcite , the large discrepancy between the two calculations is surprising .    in this paper",
    "we solve both of these puzzles .",
    "implicit in both puzzles is the choice of the factorization scale , which had been chosen to be the higgs - boson mass in refs .  @xcite .",
    "although the choice of the factorization scale in a fixed - order calculation is often regarded as arbitrary , we argue that there is a prescription based on physical considerations . refining the discussion of ref .",
    "@xcite , we show that the relevant factorization scale is a fraction of the higgs - boson mass , approximately @xmath2 .",
    "we find that this choice of scale solves both puzzles listed above .",
    "we thereby present a reliable nlo calculation of the inclusive cross section for the production of the higgs boson in association with bottom quarks .    in section  [ sec : scale",
    "] we determine the relevant factorization scale for higgs - boson production in association with bottom quarks . in section  [ sec : results ] we present the results of this scale choice .",
    "we discuss these results in section  [ sec : discussion ] , and show that they solve the two puzzles listed above .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes the conclusions of our study and suggests further work .",
    "the @xmath1 distribution function , like any parton distribution function , sums ( to all orders ) collinear logarithms that appear at higher orders .",
    "thus , to determine the relevant factorization scale , we investigate the collinear logarithm that arises at next - to - leading order .",
    "there are two independent nlo corrections to @xmath0 .",
    "the first is from initial gluons , @xmath21 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gbhb ] ) , which is a correction of order @xmath25 , as explained in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the second is from virtual and real gluon emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bbhvirtual ] ) , which is a correction of order @xmath26 .",
    "since @xmath29 is proportional to @xmath30 , one can regard both of these corrections as being of the form of an inverse logarithm .",
    "the calculations involved are identical to those of refs .",
    "we keep the effect of the bottom - quark mass exactly in our calculations , without approximations . in order to do this , we may set the bottom - quark mass to zero in all diagrams in which the bottom quark appears as an initial - state parton .",
    "this is called the simplified aivazis - collins - olness - tung ( acot ) scheme @xcite .",
    "the only subprocess in which we must keep the bottom - quark mass is @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ggbbh ] ) , which is a next - to - next - to - leading - order correction of order @xmath31 . in practice , for @xmath32",
    ", it is an excellent approximation to neglect the bottom - quark mass in this subprocess ; we keep the mass nonzero , nevertheless .",
    "let us first investigate the @xmath25 correction , from initial gluons .",
    "the first diagram in fig .",

    "[ fig : dsigdtgbhb ] the hadronic differential cross section times the squared virtuality , @xmath36 , versus the virtuality ( scaled to the higgs - boson mass ) , @xmath37 , for a variety of higgs - boson masses at the tevatron and the lhc . in order to compare the cross sections for different higgs - boson masses at a given collider",
    ", we normalize the curves to unity at small virtualities .",
    "the curves are nearly identical , demonstrating that the differential cross section scales with the higgs - boson mass . at small virtualities",
    "the curve is flat , indicating the collinear behavior @xmath34 . at larger virtualities",
    "the cross section is damped .",
    "for fixed @xmath33 , the differential cross section is given by @xcite @xmath38 \\frac{\\alpha_s(\\mu_r)}{24}\\left(\\frac{y_b(\\mu_r)}{\\sqrt 2}\\right)^2\\frac{1}{s^2}\\frac{m_h^4+u^2}{st}\\ ] ] which explicitly shows the @xmath39 behavior for small @xmath33 . for larger values of @xmath40 , the lower limit on the @xmath41 integration , @xmath42 , increases and damps the cross section , since the integrand falls steeply with increasing @xmath41 .",
    "figure  [ fig : dsigdtgbhb ] shows that the virtuality at which the behavior of the differential cross section deviates substantially from the collinear behavior is much less than @xmath3 .",
    "since the curves vary smoothly , there is some ambiguity in defining the virtuality at which the collinear behavior ceases . for the sake of discussion ,",
    "let us define @xmath43 as the collinear region .",
    "the collinear region extends to slightly higher virtualities at the lhc than at the tevatron , but this is small compared with the inherent ambiguity in defining the collinear region .",
    "the collinear logarithm that is generated at nlo is therefore approximately @xmath44 , rather than @xmath45 .",
    "thus the factorization scale for the @xmath25 correction should be chosen to be of order @xmath46 in order to sum the collinear logarithm .",
    "we will examine the consequences of this scale choice in the next section . in order to account for the ambiguity in defining the collinear region",
    ", we will vary the factorization scale between @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",

    "@xcite , where the behavior of the cross section as a function of the transverse momentum of the final - state @xmath1 quark , @xmath49 , is studied .",
    "we prefer to instead use the variable @xmath35 , which has the interpretation of the virtuality of the @xmath33-channel bottom - quark propagator . since we adopt the simplified acot formalism @xcite , we are able to set the @xmath1 mass to zero , which makes the discussion of the finite @xmath1 mass in ref .",
    "@xcite moot . despite these differences ,",
    "our approach is very similar to that of ref .",

    "a cut of @xmath50 is imposed to regulate the infrared singularity associated with soft - gluon emission .",

    "@xcite , we fix the renormalization scale of the yukawa coupling to @xmath51 . it was shown in that paper that the renormalization - scale dependence of the cross section is modest , and is reduced at nlo in comparison with lo .",

    "the four curves on each plot are described below .",
    "the results for heavier higgs bosons are qualitatively similar . while a standard - model higgs boson of 100 gev is excluded , the lower bounds on the masses of the neutral higgs bosons @xmath53 of the minimal supersymmetric standard model are about 91 gev @xcite .",

    "this nnlo correction is smallest at @xmath56 , again indicating that this is the relevant factorization scale for this process .",
    "this is significant because while it is always possible to find a factorization scale such that the nlo correction is small , it is not guaranteed that this same scale will yield a small nnlo correction , unless there is a good motivation for this scale .",
    "we anticipate that a full nnlo calculation will further support our argument that the relevant factorization scale for this process is @xmath56 .    the results at the lhc , the lower plot in fig .  [ fig : sigma ] , are qualitatively similar to those at the tevatron .",

    "<S> higgs bosons with enhanced coupling to bottom quarks are copiously produced at hadron colliders via @xmath0 , where the initial @xmath1 quarks reside in the proton sea . </S>",
    "<S> we revisit the calculation of the next - to - leading - order cross section for this process and argue that the appropriate factorization scale for the @xmath1 distribution functions is approximately @xmath2 , rather than @xmath3 , as had been previously assumed . </S>",
    "<S> this greatly improves the convergence of the perturbation series , and yields a result with mild factorization - scale dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the leading - order calculation of @xmath4 , integrated over the momenta of the final - state particles , is very sensitive to the factorization and renormalization scales . for scales of order @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5 cross section is comparable to that of @xmath0 , in contrast to the order - of - magnitude discrepancy between these two calculations for the scale @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the result we obtain improves the prospects for higgs - boson discovery at hadron colliders for large values of @xmath6 . </S>"
