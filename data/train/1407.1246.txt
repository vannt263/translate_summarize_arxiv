    "in previous work @xcite it was found that when a soap film in the shape of a mbius band becomes unstable it collides with its frame via a neck - like singularity .",
    "this collision yields changes in three topological quantities : the genus , the sidedness , and the linking number between the plateau border and the frame ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "these experiments could not , by themselves , establish if there was causality in these results , so we sought other film configurations to test which of the topological parameters , if any , are predictors of the transition .",
    "one such configuration starts from the surface first introduced by almgren @xcite ( see fig . [",
    "this film has the interesting feature of having an intersection along a segment that can develop into a secondary film by slightly pushing the descending tab .",
    "the direction in which the tab is pushed determines if the secondary film lies towards the front or the back ( figs .",
    "[ fig1]a.i and a.ii , respectively ) . as illustrated , the two possible resolutions of the unstable four - fold vertex into the films in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a.i and a.ii correspond to the two stable states which , in the language of foams , interconvert through a t1 process @xcite . puncturing the secondary film when it lies towards the front produces the well - known result @xcite shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b , which is topologically equivalent to a section of a torus . on the other hand , puncturing the secondary film when it lies towards the back produces a surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]c ) that we believe has not been identified before in this context , and which corresponds to a punctured klein bottle , i.e. two mbius bands of opposite chirality sewn together over part of their boundaries .",
    "it is this latter surface that we used to test our hypotheses .",
    "this punctured klein bottle ( _ punctured klein _ ) is an ideal choice because , like the mbius band ( linking number 2 , non - orientable genus 1 ) , it is one - sided , but its plateau border linking number with the frame is zero and its non - orientable genus is 2 , allowing us to separate the two topological parameters .    by pulling apart the top sections of the frame in fig .",
    "[ fig1]c the punctured klein becomes unstable and undergoes a transition to a disk by means of two mirror image singularities .",
    "this transition , which is identical to two simultaneous mbius transitions of opposite chirality , becomes fully dynamical after onset and once it has finished ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]c.ii , or equivalently fig .",
    "[ fig1]c.i.2 ) the parameters that have changed are the sidedness and the genus",
    ". there are at least two other alternative routes from the punctured klein to the disk .",
    "the second route , although much harder to realize experimentally , is very intuitive mathematically : since the punctured klein is made of two sewn mbius bands it is possible to first coerce the frame into collapsing one of the bands producing a change of non - orientable genus from 2 to 1 and also from linking number from 0 to @xmath0 , and leaving as a result only one of the mbius bands of the original pair ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]c.i.1 ) .",
    "hence the surface is still one - sided .",
    "the last part of the process is the usual mbius collapse that will yield the two - sided disk ( fig . [",
    "fig1]c.i.2 ) and will again change both the genus and the linking number to zero , as expected .",
    "in the end the features of the collapse to a final two - sided disk can be distilled to those of the two individual mbius bands that made the whole and as a consequence each one of these two steps is a fully dynamical process . the fact that any other film that can be constructed in such a way that it consists of a series of mbius bands sewn together can be analyzed in a similar manner hints to the possibility of constructing a simple algebra to keep track of the net changes of the topological parameters of the surface at every stage of the collapse .",
    "the third way to convert the punctured klein into a disk requires deforming the boundary quasi - statically by pulling the tab upwards slowly until its tip rises above the plane of the horizontal film ( figs .",
    "[ fig1]c.iii.1 - c.iii.3 ) . along this route , unlike along the other two , the process can be stopped at any instant of time and there will always be a stable minimal surface that spans the frame . when the tip of the tab finally reaches the horizontal plane ( d ) the twists of the plateau borders and the ` holes ' of the film will all converge to a point ( the location of the singularity ) .",
    "the twists will annihilate each other because they are of opposite chirality and the hole will vanish to a point . in the physical film the hole would disappear by reconnecting .",
    "all these different routes to the end result share the feature that the singularity always occurs at the boundary .    in the same way in which a whole class of transitions in the bulk reduces asymptotically to the neck - like transition of the catenoid",
    ", we expect that a whole class of boundary transitions of one - sided surfaces will reduce to the the neck - like transition of a mbius band .",
    "thus , studying the collapses of these two surfaces should be sufficient to cover all possible types of neck - like singularities .",
    "there are three possible types of collapse :    a.   _ quasi - static boundary singularity _ : the surface changes its topology in such a way that a stable minimal surface can be found at every instant before and up to the time of the singularity which occurs at the boundary .",
    "b.   _ catastrophic bulk singularity _ : the surface changes its topology after becoming unstable . hence , the process is fully dynamic and there are no intermediate stable minimal surfaces visited in between the last stable surface before onset and until the final stable surface is reached . in this case",
    "the singularity is located in the bulk c.   _ catastrophic boundary singularity _ : the same as ( ii ) except that the singularity occurs at the boundary .    while there is a fourth possibility  a quasi - static bulk singularity  we have not found a film configuration where this is observed .",
    "the different types of singularities have a specific correlation with the change of topology , but beyond the change of genus , there is no one - to - one correspondence between the type of transition and the topological parameters .",
    "the rules that govern the transitions are : -0.7 cm    a.   in a catastrophic boundary singularity there is a change in either the linking number or sidedness , or both .",
    "b.   if a change of linking number or sidedness occurs there is a boundary singularity , either catastrophic or quasi - static .",
    "c.   a catastrophic bulk singularity can change neither the linking number nor the sidedness of the surface .",
    "d.   a quasi - static boundary singularity can support any type of topological change .",
    "-0.3 cm from our studies it appears that both types of catastrophic singularities , bulk and boundary , can be transformed into a boundary quasi - static singularity by choosing a suitable frame deformation .",
    "for example , for the catenoid , instead of pulling the rings apart to render the film unstable and force the transition to two disks we can tilt the top ring quasi - statically until it reaches a position where the film touches itself and the boundary , thus creating a pair of disks connected by a single point .",
    "the connection point is the location of the singularity that occurs as the two disks are finally separated .    ]",
    "the experiments also helped with the study of another feature of these films that is connected with geometric characteristics of the associated minimal surfaces .",
    "in general , when films that will collapse through a neck - like singularity are made , they come out of the soap solution with a secondary film spanning the neck ( figures [ fig2]a , c and e ) .",
    "this feature was highlighted by almgren and collaborators @xcite , who named the shared curve between the main and secondary films the singular set . if the secondary film is allowed to remain while the wire is deformed it is possible to contract it to a point so that the final surface is identical to the one that would have been obtained if the secondary film were removed at the start of the process . because soap films minimize area it is clear that the location of the singular set is also the location of the shortest closed non - contractible geodesic on the main film . in fact , we observe that secondary films generically occur in situations where the main film supports the existence of such a curve . when the secondary film contracts during a transition , this geodesic shrinks and eventually reduces to a point which coincides with the location of the singularity .",
    "not surprisingly , in the absence of the secondary film , the shortest closed geodesic of the main film is close to the original singular set . in a physical film",
    "the shortest closed geodesic in the main film is , however , longer than the curve determined by the singular set due to the effect of surface tension .      in this section",
    "we first address whether motion by mean curvature is capable of reproducing the experimental observations of boundary singularities in the collapse of mbius band and punctured klein surfaces .",
    "this requires mathematical representations of boundary curves for the two cases which contain parameters describing the deformations leading to surfaces instabilities . for the mbius band",
    "we have previously identified @xcite the one - parameter family of curves @xmath1 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xcite    [ eqn1 ] @xmath4~,\\\\ y(\\theta)&=&\\frac{1}{\\ell_m}[\\mu\\tau\\sin\\theta+(1-\\tau)\\sin 2\\theta],\\\\ z(\\theta)&=&\\frac{1}{\\ell_m}[2\\mu\\tau(1-\\tau)\\sin\\theta]~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , the parameter @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) interpolates smoothly from the double - covering of the circle for @xmath7 to a single circle in the @xmath8-plane when @xmath9 .",
    "the factor @xmath10 normalizes the wire length to @xmath11 . numerical studies with surface evolver @xcite show that the one - sided minimal surface spanning this curve becomes unstable when @xmath12 , whereas the two - sided surface becomes unstable for @xmath13 . in between these values",
    "the system is bistable , with the energies of the two surfaces crossing at @xmath14 .    the frame shown in fig .",

    "was obtained by starting with an equilibrium shape close to the critical parameter(s ) for instability and then incrementing one of the parameter(s ) a small amount beyond the threshold .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the surface was calculated using the hessian command in surface evolver with repeated equiangulations and vertex averaging to ensure a well - behaved mesh . in both the mbius and punctured klein cases we find that the singularity or singularities are indeed located at the frame .",
    "these dynamical evolutions are shown in movies s1 & s2 ( mbius ) and s3 & s4 ( punctured klein ) .     for @xmath20 .",

    "[ fig3 ] ]    to quantify the collapse of a neck to the boundary we determined from each triangulated surface the narrowest ` diameter ' @xmath25 of the neck measured from the point of the eventual location of the singularity to the point on the shortest non - contractible geodesic of the neck at which the normal is the generating vector of the line that joins both points ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "that geodesic , in turn , was found by means of an adaptation of kirsanov s matlab program @xcite to find exact geodesics between two specified endpoints on a triangular mesh . to find _ closed _ geodesics we implemented an iterative procedure to adjust the positions of three endpoints spaced around the neck until the three geodesic segments formed a single smooth curve .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the projections of the geodesics onto the @xmath26 plane and the neck diameter @xmath25 for the mbius collapse as a function of iteration number of the relaxation scheme .",
    "observe that the stationary right - hand section of the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig4]b are the sections that the geodesics share with the boundary .",
    "the results indicate a clear collapse to the boundary in finite time . while the data appear consistent with a power - law variation of @xmath25 with time , with a sublinear exponent , at present there is insufficient resolution to determine that exponent more precisely .",
    "as we have mentioned before , motion by mean curvature can not faithfully represent a bulk singularity in a physical film because in such a film the effects of air pressure have a crucial role in the last stages of the collapse when a rayleigh instability is triggered and the film produces a satellite drop ( or cascade of drops with a cut off controlled by the parameters of the film ) @xcite .",
    "the difference between this singularity and the boundary one that makes the latter amenable to description with mean curvature flow is that physical effects other than surface tension , for instance thickness variations in the film , become relevant only after the singularity has fully developed .",
    "in fact , the reconnection of the plateau border in the collision with the boundary occurs _",
    "after _ the surface has reached the location of the singularity .     plane ( see fig . [ fig3 ] ) as a function of iteration number @xmath27 in the relaxation scheme .",
    "the singularity appears at the boundary at a finite time .",
    "[ fig4 ] ]    _ location of singularity .",
    "_ systoles , or shortest non - contractible geodesics , have been extensively studied in the context of general closed orientable riemannian manifolds @xcite .",
    "in fact , inequalities relating the systole s length to the surface area and volume of the manifold are well known .",
    "each one of the shortest non - contractible closed geodesics that we used to characterize the neck evolution under mean curvature flow is an example of a local systole with respect to the boundary ( lsrb ) , as defined in the introduction . while up until now we have only found each local systole as the neck shrinks , it is also possible to find the one such curve on the stable minimal surface prior to the onset of the instability .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the local systoles for stable minimal punctured klein ( a , b ) and mbius band ( c ) surfaces , where for the latter the systole is unique . in the case of the punctured klein bottle",
    "we show only one systole - the second is a mirror image across the central vertical plane of symmetry .",
    "when the frame parameters are slightly beyond their critical values and the surfaces start their dynamic evolution towards the collapse the systoles of the stable configurations can be viewed as the initial conditions for the successive family of systoles described in the previous subsection .",
    "a notable feature of each and every one of these systoles , including the one corresponding to the stable minimal surface , is that they are topologically linked to the boundary . in the case of the mbius strip embedded in space",
    ", it can be shown that all non - contractible curves are in fact linked to the boundary .",
    "it is this linkage that provides a predictor of the location of the singularity .",
    "in fact , in the classic instability of the catenoid produced by pulling the two rings apart , in which the systoles are never linked to the boundary , the singularities occur in the bulk .",
    "moreover , when the catenoid collapse is forced by tilting the rings to induce a quasi - static boundary singularity the systole eventually attaches itself to the boundary immediately before the surface reaches the singularity point ; since this evolution has a stable minimal surface at all times the position of the systole prior to collapse also gives , even though trivially , an accurate prediction of the type of singularity",
    ".    the reason systoles are important and useful in the prediction of the character of the motion may be understand through the following heuristic argument : the curvature associated with the systole is exactly canceled by its conjugate curvature when the surface is minimal . when the surface becomes unstable this delicate balance is broken and it will move with a speed that varies from point to point , driven by the laplace pressure difference , which is itself proportional to the mean curvature ( note that both in mean curvature flow and in more realistic models it is this pressure difference that determines the surface velocity ) . since in the unstable regime the points with the largest mean curvature are generically those on the systole , they will move fastest and reach the singularity first by shrinking to a point . furthermore , because of this shrinkage of the systole and the impossibility of any point on the surface traversing the boundary , the topological linkage of the systole and the boundary automatically determines the character ( bulk or boundary ) of the singularity .",
    "given that the mbius band is the paradigm for singularity formation at the boundary , it follows that having an analytic result for the systoles of this surface , even an approximate one , is very desirable . with this mind",
    "we have used the ruled surfaces @xcite generated by eq .",
    "[ eqn1 ] , where now @xmath28 @xcite . with the surface specified by the vector @xmath29 ,",
    "the length @xmath30 of a curve on that surface is @xmath31^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are the coefficients of the first fundamental form . to find the geodesic",
    ", we use a relaxation dynamics with @xmath30 as a lyapunov function , @xmath35 figure [ fig5]d shows the numerically obtained geodesic for the case @xmath36 . observe that the solution hugs the boundary over a finite arc .",
    "this is consistent with the general result that a geodesic can not touch the boundary if the geodesic curvature @xmath37 of the boundary is positive , supported by the following argument .",
    "suppose @xmath38 is a geodesic curve in a surface @xmath39 , parametrized by arc length @xmath40 .",
    "then the second derivative of @xmath41 is normal to @xmath39 , for otherwise , we could shrink @xmath41 by pushing it in the direction of the second derivative . if @xmath41 touches the boundary at a convex point , then the second derivative of @xmath41 in the direction normal to the boundary but tangent to @xmath39 must be positive , and we can shrink @xmath41 by gently pushing it in that direction .",
    "it follows that moving a geodesic in the direction of the second derivative when the boundary curvature is negative will push the curve off the surface .",
    "hence , negative geodesic curvature of the boundary is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the systole to touch it . in the present case",
    ", a straightforward calculation shows that @xmath42 where @xmath43 are polynomials in @xmath5 .",
    "one can verify that the region of @xmath44 over which the numerical geodesic coincides with the boundary does indeed lie within the region of negative @xmath37 .",
    "-coordinate of points on surfaces . [ fig5 ] ]    a remarkably good analytic approximation to the systole on the ruled surface can be obtained by first finding a curve whose tangent vector is everywhere orthogonal to both the surface normal and the lines of constant @xmath45 .",
    "such a curve does not lie on the surface .",
    "however , as the binormal to that curve is constant , it lies in a plane , which can be easily found .",
    "the approximate geodesic is then found as the intersection of the ruled surface and that plane .",
    "this curve can be expressed explicitly in terms of its cartesian components or parametrically in the form @xmath46 by first defining    [ pollo ] @xmath47    if eq .",
    "[ pollo]b has real solutions for @xmath48 ( which occurs for @xmath49 ) , then the geodesic is defined piecewise : @xmath50 note that this ruled surface has the non - physical feature of self - intersection for @xmath51 . for @xmath52 the approximate geodesic does not touch the boundary , and has the form @xmath53 .",
    "this is shown overlaid in red in figure [ fig5 ] . as with the numerically - obtained geodesic ,",
    "the region of coincidence with the boundary lies within the domain of negative geodesic boundary curvature , as required .",
    "by identifying examples of boundary singularities , other than the collapse of the mbius band , that occur when there is a topological change in soap films spanning a wire we have made a first attempt at classifying them .",
    "besides the well - known bulk singularity we found two other types @xmath54quasi - static and catastrophic@xmath55 both occurring at the boundary .",
    "we found strong evidence that any catastrophic singularity which develops a neck will asymptotically converge to a mbius like singularity .",
    "furthermore , numerical studies showed that motion by mean curvature exhibits boundary singularities , reproducing the experimental findings .",
    "we also found that the predictor of the position of the singularity was the linkage between the boundary and the systole of the last stable surface before the onset of instability .    clearly , these results are not in a rigorous framework , but provide insight into which variables have a role in the transition .",
    "they also suggest that among the singularity types , the one corresponding to the quasi - static boundary should be the less difficult to study because it is the one for which it is possible to construct a family of stable minimal surfaces at all times .",
    "an important goal is to establish rigorously the conditions under which mean curvature motion leads to a boundary singularity .",
    "a more modest goal currently under study is to prove , in the context of the mbius surface we have parametrized , that motion by mean curvature produces a singularity at the boundary .",

    "<S> this simple example provided a first model to investigate the dynamical aspects of the formation of a boundary singularity from the moment the system becomes unstable , and until a new stable configuration is reached . while progress was made in the particular case of the mbius band , left unanswered were questions of greater generality : ( i ) are there any other configurations of films spanning a frame that have a topology transition with a boundary singularity , showing that this behavior is generic , rather than exceptional ? </S>",

    "<S> the singularity occurs only when the rings have been separated beyond a critical distance and the film , as it becomes unstable , develops a narrow neck on which a non - contractible curve of least length , or ` systole relative to the boundary ' ( srb ) @xcite , can be found . </S>",
    "<S> even though the collapse of the catenoid is a situation characterized by high symmetry , we will see here , through a combination of experiment and computation , that there is a whole class of singularities that follow the same pattern of neck formation such that infinitesimally close to but before the onset of the instability it is possible to identify a ` local ' srb ( lsrb ) that constitutes the initial condition for the evolution of the curve whose contraction ends at the location of the singularity ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> we find that this feature of the initial lsrb and its linkage to the boundary makes it possible to deduce whether the singularity occurs in the bulk or at the boundary , and also that the way in which the same boundary is deformed before onset of the instability can produce different types of singularities . </S>"
