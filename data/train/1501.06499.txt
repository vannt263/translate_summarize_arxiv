    "discrete symmetries play a vital role in model building  @xcite . over the past few decades",
    "they have been widely used to restrict the superpotential and suppress the exotic interactions of numerous proposed effective theories . in the standard model , as well as in old guts , abelian factors and discrete symmetries of @xmath0 type where imposed to forbid dangerous lepton and baryon number violating operators . in more recent scenarios , non - abelian discrete groups where introduced to interpret the mixing properties of the neutrino sector  @xcite . in the field theory context",
    ", these symmetries were postulated purely on phenomenological grounds .",
    "however , it is not clear whether such global ( including discrete ) symmetries can exist  @xcite . in this respect",
    ", it would be interesting to investigate whether such symmetries can be justified in the context of string theory .",
    "recently , considerable work in this direction has been devoted  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a fascinating possibility in particular arises in f - theory constructions where symmetries are tightly connected to the elliptically fibred internal space .",
    "this compact space is a four - dimensional complex manifold ( a fourfold ) while the gauge symmetries are linked to its singularities .",
    "hence , we may consider that all symmetries , including the discrete part , are associated to the geometric properties of the fourfold . in the present talk",
    "i will discuss the origin of discrete symmetries in f - models .",
    "i will start with a short description of the basic features of f - model building focusing in particular to the properties related to the elliptic curves .",
    "f - theory  @xcite is an exciting reformulation of string theory in a 12-dimensional space which consists of the 4 space - time dimensions and an 8-dimensional internal elliptically fibred compact space . because of its relation to the theory of elliptic curves and in particular their complex representations , effective f - theory models",
    "are endowed with many interesting properties . in the present talk",
    "i will mainly focus on some features of the abelian and discrete symmetries that emerge from the rational sections of the elliptic curves .",
    "many of the properties that will be discussed are related to rational points on curves .",
    "a point is said to be rational if its coordinates are rational , while a rational curve is defined by an equation with rational coefficients .",
    "it is trivial to find the rational points on lines and conics .",
    "consider for example the equation of the unit circle @xmath1 .",
    "choosing a rational point on it , -let it be @xmath2- we can draw a line which intersects the circle at @xmath3 . we can map this pair on the line identified with the vertical axis @xmath4 by the transformation @xmath5        this way , all rational points @xmath3 on the curve can be determined in terms of the rational values of the parameter @xmath6 . because of this correspondence between the rational points , we say that the curve ( in this case the conic ) is * birationally equivalent * to the line . a rational curve",
    "is also called a curve of genus zero .",
    "every genus zero curve is birationally equivalent either to a conic or to a line .",
    "we proceed now to the elliptic curves which are described by a cubic equation whose most general form can be written as : _",
    "n=0 ^ 3_m=0^n a_m , n x^n y^n - m = 0[gelc ] the identification of the rational points on a given elliptic curve @xmath7 of general type is much more complicated compared to the conic .",
    "we know however , that the rational points of @xmath7 exhibit a group structure . according to mordell s theorem , + _",
    "if a non - singular elliptic curve @xmath7 has a rational point then the group of rational points can be finitely generated .",
    "_ + in other words , there is a finite number of elements generating the whole group .",
    "the group structure is depicted here in figure  [ grouplaw ] which can be defined as follows : let @xmath8 two rational points on @xmath7 .",
    "drawing the line joining these two points , we can find another one at the third intersection of the line with the curve @xmath7 .",
    "i designate this point with @xmath9 .",
    "suppose now we are given a rational point @xmath10 on @xmath7 that we can identify this to be the zero element of the group .",
    "the line from @xmath10 to @xmath9 intersects @xmath7 on another point which , as can be proved  , under the group law is the point @xmath11 . to find the opposite element with respect to the addition law of the group , we draw a tangent to the zeroth element @xmath10 which intersects @xmath7 at some point called here @xmath12 .",
    "one can prove that the opposite to @xmath13 is identified with the third intersection of the @xmath14-line and curve @xmath7 , so that @xmath15 .",
    "the general form ( [ gelc ] ) of the elliptic equation is rather too complicated .",
    "fortunately it can be shown that any cubic equation with a rational point on it can be brought to the weierstra form y^2=x^3+f x + g [ weif ] we can readily check that the weierstra form is symmetric with respect to the @xmath16-axis . moreover , the zeroth element of the group can be taken to infinity while the sum of two points is just the reflection ( w.r.t .",
    "@xmath16-axis ) of the third intersection point of the line pq with @xmath7 .",
    "there are two important quantities characterising the elliptic curves .",
    "these are : + @xmath17 the discriminant & = & 4 f^3 + 27 g^2[discr ] which classifies the singularities on the matter curve . in particular , when @xmath18 curves are non - singular and",
    "may have one or three real roots .",
    "when @xmath19 curves are singular .",
    "singularities are of nodal or cuspidal type .",
    "+ @xmath17 the j - invariant ( modular invariant ) function j()= = [ jinv ] which takes the same value for equivalent elliptic curves characterised by the @xmath20 transformations @xmath21 .",
    "what happens when we consider complex coefficients ( functions ) @xmath22 ? in this case , it can proved that a complex elliptic curve @xmath7 is a genus 1 closed surface with a marked point on it corresponding to its neutral element ( point to infinity ) . defining a modulus @xmath23 as usually , the torus , hence @xmath7 , is equivalent to the lattice @xmath24 . with respect to the previous analysis of elliptic curves ,",
    "we distinguish two cases : the complex analogue of a real elliptic curve with non - singular points is a torus without singularities . on the contrary , if the real elliptic curve has singular points then its complex equivalent is a torus with a pinched radius .",
    "in this section , a few basic features of f - theory  @xcite are described which are useful to the subsequent analysis .",
    "the shortest ( however incomplete ) definition of f - theory is that it is the geometrisation of the type ii - b superstring .",
    "the type iib string is distinguished by its closed string spectrum ( which differs , say , from ii - a case ) .",
    "it is obtained by combining l- and r- moving open strings with the truncated two types of boundary conditions , namely the neveu - schwarz ( antiperiodic ) and ramond ( periodic ) boundary conditions .    in the bosonic spectrum",
    "there are two scalars , the dilaton field @xmath25 and a zero - form potential ( axion ) @xmath26 .",
    "one then can define a modulus , the axion - dilaton complex structure = c_0+ie^- [ cdilaton ] and write down an @xmath20 invariant action of the ten - dimensional theory which leads to the correct equations of motion .",
    "the terms of the action seem as if they are obtained from a twelve dimensional theory compactified along the two radii of the torus ( for a review see  @xcite ) .",
    "we can think of @xmath23 as the modulus of a torus attached to each point of the internal manifold of three complex dimensions ( threefold ) , as depicted in figure  [ fiberb3 ] .",
    "we end up with a fibred fourfold .     a torus @xmath27 is assigned . ]    recalling the analysis of the first section , one is tempted to consider the interesting possibility of describing this fibration by the weierstra model given in equation ( [ weif ] ) . in particular , we write it in the form y^2=x^3+f x z^4+g z^6[weif2 ] where @xmath28 are homogeneous complex coordinates . as explained previously , for @xmath29 complex , equation ( [ weif ] ) describes a torus whose modulus @xmath23 is now identified with that of  ( [ cdilaton ] ) . on the other hand , in order to satisfy the calabi - yau ( cy ) conditions , we also require the two functions @xmath30 to be @xmath31 and @xmath32 degree polynomials of the complex variable @xmath33 . as we move from point to point in the internal manifold ,",
    "the modulus @xmath23 varies .",
    "in particular , on moving along non - trivial closed cycles , @xmath23 undergoes non - trivial @xmath20 transformations   modular invariant function is given by @xmath34 . combined with  ( [ jinv ] )",
    "one can elaborate  @xcite a relation approximated with @xmath35 in the vicinity of the zeros of @xmath36 . ] . in figure  [ fiberb3 ] for any generic point",
    "we draw a normal torus , while pinched torii are drawn at points of singularities ; the latter appear when two d7-branes intersect at a ` point ' of the manifold .",
    "these correspond to singularities of elliptic surfaces and were classified in terms of the vanishing orders of the discriminant and the polynomials @xmath37 several decades ago by kodaira  @xcite . for minimal elliptic surfaces",
    "eight types of singular fiber were identified , ( nodal , cuspidal or otherwise reducible ) .",
    "the singularities are related to simply - laced dynkin diagrams of ade type .",
    "these extremely interesting results can be found in several recent papers and reviews  @xcite , thus , they will not be presented in this short note .",
    "instead , we will shortly give an analogous algorithm in another representation which will be useful in our subsequent analysis .",
    "the nature of the singularities of the internal space motivated the idea that they can be identified with the gauge symmetries of the effective field theory model .",
    "if this is true , then one can attribute all the properties of the internal manifold to the massless spectrum and the effective potential describing their interactions .",
    "this scenario has many advantages , including calculability of yukawa couplings  @xcite-@xcite of the effective theory from a handful of geometric characteristics of the internal space .",
    ".selected cases of tate s algorithm .",
    "the first column declares the type of the singular fiber according to kodaira , i.e. nodal ( @xmath38 ) , cuspidal ( @xmath39 ) etc .",
    "the superscripts @xmath40 stand for _ split _ and _ non - split_. ( the complete results can be found in  @xcite . )",
    "the other columns show the order of vanishing of the coefficients @xmath41 , the discriminant @xmath42 and the corresponding gauge group .",
    "[ tatetable ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this talk , we have described a variety of discrete symmetries in f - theory models emerging in various ways .",
    "current f - theory constructions are based on the elliptically fibred internal space with @xmath43 being the highest admissible singularity .",
    "the non - abelian part of the gauge symmetry of a particular effective gut model emerges as a subgroup of the @xmath43 .",
    "however , in low energy effective models additional discrete or continuous symmetries are required to suppress flavour changing processes and prevent fast proton decay . to this end",
    ", two methods have been developed in the recent literature :    @xmath17 a class of early f - theory effective models are fully embedded in @xmath43 . as a consequence ,",
    "the gut symmetry is a subgroup of @xmath43 while the commutant incorporates any additional symmetry of discrete or continuous nature which could be used to put constraints on the effective lagrangian .",
    "@xmath17 in recent works , abelian and discrete symmetries emerge from the a non - trivial mordell - weil group , i.e. the group of rational points of the elliptic curves associated to the fibration . in this approach ,",
    "one constructs a representation of the elliptic curve with the desired rational sections and then finds the birationally equivalent weierstra equation .    in the presence of one mordell - weil factor in particular",
    ", we have shown that the birational transformations to tate s form gives two viable gauge symmetries which are @xmath44 although such a scenario looks rather restrictive , yet these exceptional groups contain all the well known guts , such as @xmath45 , @xmath46 and the like , which can be readily obtained once we break the initial symmetry by a suitable mechanism , such as flux breaking , wilson lines mechanism etc .",
    "furthermore , as long as the rank - one mordell - weil is concerned , a novel generalisation of models in the context of elliptic fibrations has been proposed recently  @xcite .",
    "finally , it should be pointed out that discrete symmetries appear naturally in f - theory compactifications without section and examples with @xmath45 gut symmetry have been presented in  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we close our discussion with a few observations .",
    "the rather interesting fact in the procedure discussed in the last section , is that the @xmath47 symmetry is not necessarily identified with some generator of the cartan subalgebra of @xmath43 .",
    "this means that the @xmath47 charges of the non - abelian representations are not necessarily the usual ones .",
    "furthermore , the torsion group has a rich structure of discrete symmetries which can also be symmetries of the effective lagrangian .",
    "perhaps issues such as proton stability , the @xmath48-term and flavour physics find their solutions in a judicious choice of these symmetries .",
