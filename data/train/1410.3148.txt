    "in a recent work @xcite , we presented a relativistic model describing a thin disk surrounded by a halo in presence of an electromagnetic field .",
    "the model was obtained by solving the einstein - maxwell equations on a particular conformastatic spacetime background and by using the distributional approach for the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the class of solution corresponding to the model is asymptotically flat and singularity - free , and satisfies all the energy conditions .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to extend the above - mentioned study to the conformastationary case , and the kuzmin solution of the laplaces equation to include a `` generalized '' kuzmin solution of the laplace s equation .",
    "the reason to undertake such an endeavour are easy to understand . indeed ,",

    "this solution is notoriously simple in its mathematical form .",
    "moreover , the interpretation of the energy - momentum tensor presented here generalises the commonly used pressure free models to a fluid with non - vanishing pressure , heat flux and anisotropic tensor . in section",

    "we complete the paper with a discussion of the results in section [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "to obtain an exact general relativistic model describing a disk surrounded by an electromagnetized halo in a conformastationary spacetime , we solved the distributional einstein - maxwell field equations assuming axial symmetry and that the derivatives of the metric and electromagnetic potential across the disk space - like hyper - surface are discontinuous . to formulate the corresponding distributional form of the einstein - maxwell field equations , we introduce the usual cylindrical coordinates @xmath0 and assume that there exists an infinitesimally thin disk located at the hypersurface @xmath1 , so that the metric and the electromagnetic potential can be written as    @xmath2    respectively .",
    "accordingly , the ricci tensor reads @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are , respectively , the heaviside and dirac distributions with support on @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 are the metric tensors and the ricci tensors of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 regions , respectively , and @xmath11 with @xmath12 and all the quantities are evaluated at @xmath13 . in agreement with ( [ eq : ricdis ] ) the energy - momentum tensor and the electric current density are expressed as    @xmath14    where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the energy - momentum tensors and electric current density of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 regions , respectively .",
    "moreover , @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent the part of the energy - momentum tensor and the electric current density corresponding to the disk - like source .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor @xmath15 in ( [ eq : emtot ] ) is taken to be the sum of two distributional components , the purely electromagnetic ( trace - free ) part and a `` material '' ( trace ) part , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the electromagnetic energy - momentum tensor @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 is an unknown `` material '' energy - momentum tensor to be obtained .",

    ", we shall restrict ourselves to the case where the electric potential @xmath30 .",
    "we also conveniently assume the existence of a function @xmath31 depending only on @xmath32 and @xmath33 in such a way that the metric ( [ eq : met0 ] ) can be written in the form @xmath34 with @xmath35 an arbitrary constant .",
    "accordingly , for the non - zero components of the energy - momentum tensor of the halo we have    @xmath36    whereas the non - zero components of the electric current density on the halo has the form    @xmath37    [ eq : halocurrent2 ]    the non - zero components of the surface energy - momentum tensor ( semt ) and the non - zero components of the surface electric current density ( secd ) of the disk are given by    @xmath38    [ eq : semtdisk ]    and    @xmath39,\\\\                   { \\cal j}^{\\varphi}&= & -r^{-2}e^{3\\beta \\phi } \\left [ a_{\\varphi , z}\\right ] ,                   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ eq : diskcurrent2 ]    respectively .",
    "note that all the quantities are evaluated on the surface of the disk .",
    "we will suppose that there is no electric current in the halo , i.e. , we assume that @xmath40 hence the system of equations ( [ eq : halocurrent2 ] ) is equivalent to the very simple system    @xmath41    [ eq : diskcurrent2 ]    where @xmath42 .",
    "if @xmath43 is a unit vector in azimuthal direction and @xmath44 is an arbitrary function independent of the azimuthal coordinate @xmath45 , then one has the identity @xmath46 the identity ( [ eq : identity ] ) may be regarded as the integrability condition for the existence of the function @xmath44 defined by @xmath47 accordingly , the identity ( [ eq : identity ] ) implies the equation @xmath48 for the `` auxiliary '' potential @xmath49 . in order to have an explicit form of the metric function @xmath31 and magnetic potential @xmath50",
    "we suppose that @xmath31 and @xmath50 depend explicitly on @xmath44 . consequently the equation ( [ eq : auxiliar ] ) implies @xmath51 where @xmath52 let us assume the very useful simplification @xmath53 with @xmath54 an arbitrary constant .",
    "then , we have @xmath55 and @xmath56 where @xmath57 is an arbitrary constant . furthermore ,",
    "if we assume the existence of a function @xmath58 with @xmath59 and @xmath60 arbitrary constants , then @xmath61 accordingly , @xmath44 can be represented in terms of solutions of the laplace s equation : @xmath62 hence , the metric potential @xmath31 can be written in terms of @xmath63 as @xmath64 to obtain the metric function @xmath65 we first note that from ( [ eq : identity2 ] ) we have the relationship between @xmath50 and @xmath44 : @xmath66 then we have , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , or , in terms of @xmath63    @xmath69    [ eq : avarphi ]    where @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , with ( [ eq : avarphi ] ) into ( [ eq : disktcurrent2 ] ) we arrive to @xmath71 which admits the solution @xmath72 , with @xmath73 and @xmath74 arbitrary constants . as we know",
    ", the line element ( [ eq : met1 ] ) must reduce to the minkowski metric at spatial infinity .",
    "this means that the gravitational and magnetic fields vanish at large distances from the gravitational source , i.e. , it is asymptotically flat .",
    "this requires that the constants @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "in the above section we summarised the procedure to obtain conformastationary axially symmetric relativistic thin disks surrounded by a material halo in presence of a magnetic field . additionally , we introduced a functional relationship dependence between the metric and the magnetic potential and an harmonic auxiliary function in order to obtain a family of solutions of the distributional einstein - maxwell field equations . in short",
    ", we used the inverse method , where a solution of the field equations is taken and then the energy - momentum tensor is obtained .",
    "now , the behaviour of the energy - momentum tensor obtained must be investigated in order to find what conditions must be imposed over the solutions and the parameters that appear in the disk - haloes models in such a way that the energy - momentum tensor can describe a reasonable physical source . when the the energy - momentum tensor is diagonal its interpretation is immediate . on the another hand , when the energy - momentum tensor is non diagonal its physical content can be properly analyzed by writing it in the canonical form . accordingly , to investigate the physical content of the semt of the disk",
    "we assume that it is possible to express it in the canonical form @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "consequently , we can say that the disk is constituted by some mass - energy distribution described by the last surface energy - momentum tensor and @xmath79 is the four velocity of certain observer .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are then the energy density , the isotropic pressure , the heat flux and the anisotropic tensor on the surface of the disk , respectively .",
    "thus , it is immediate to see that @xcite    @xmath84    [ eq : observables ]    where the projection tensor is defined by @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "it is easy to note that by choosing the angular velocity to be zero in @xmath87 we have then a fluid comoving in our coordinates system .",
    "hence , we may introduce a suitable reference frame in terms of the local observers tetrad ( [ eq : localobservator ] ) and ( [ eq : duallocalobservator ] ) in the form @xmath88 , with the corresponding dual tetrad @xmath89 .",
    "accordingly , by using ( [ eq : diskenergy ] ) , ( [ eq : diskpressure ] ) and ( [ eq : semtdisk ] ) we have for the surface energy density and the pressure of the disk @xmath90 and @xmath91 respectively . by introducing ( [ eq : semtdisk ] ) into ( [ eq : diskheatflux ] ) we obtain for the non - zero components of the heat flux @xmath92 similarly , by using ( [ eq : diskanisotropict ] ) and ( [ eq : semtdisk ] ) we have for the non - zero components of the anisotropic tensor a direct calculation shows that @xmath93    @xmath94    it is important to remark that due to that we used the inverse method , no `` a priori '' restriction are imposed on the physical properties of the material constituting the disks .",
    "the non - zero components of the semt of the disks result of `` the nature '' of the chosen metric and the corresponding solutions .",
    "so , in our case , the non - zero component @xmath95 and @xmath96 are conditioned by the parameter @xmath35 and the metric function @xmath65 . when @xmath97 the component @xmath95 vanishes , whereas @xmath98 when @xmath65 vanishes .",
    "the decomposition ( [ eq : semtcanonical ] ) was chosen with the aim to describe the semt by the more general fluid model .",
    "hence , the heat flux appear here in a `` natural '' way as a function determined by the metric function @xmath65 and , consequently , by the `` rotation '' .",
    "unfortunately , as we can see from ( [ eq : heat ] ) , this function is oriented along the closed circular orbits and thus its physical interpretation is unclear .",
    "it is an issue which remains unanswered in this manuscript , but should be addressed in the future .",
    "analogously , the secd of the disk @xmath99 can be also written in the canonical form @xmath100 then @xmath101 can be interpreted as the surface electric charge density and @xmath102 as the `` current of magnetization '' of the disk .",
    "a direct calculation shows that the surface electric charge density @xmath103 , whereas the `` current of magnetization '' of the disk is given by @xmath104 ,                         \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , as above , @xmath105 $ ] denotes the jump of the @xmath106derivative of the magnetic potential across of the disk and , all quantities are evaluated on the disk .",
    "thus , by using the results of the precedent section , we can write the surface energy density , the pressure , the heat flux , the non - zero components of the anisotropic tensor and the current of magnetization on the surface of the disk , respectively , as    @xmath107   } { k ( 1-u)^{\\frac{3\\beta}{1+\\beta } } } \\label{eq : diskcurrent+u } ,                                            \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ eq : observables+u ]    where , as we know , @xmath108 is an arbitrary suitable solution of the 2-dimensional laplace s equation in cylindrical coordinates and @xmath109 $ ] denotes of the jump of the @xmath32-derivative of the @xmath63 across of the disk .",
    "all the quantities are evaluated on the surface of the disk .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath73 is a defining constant in ( [ eq : diskheatflux+u ] ) .",
    "indeed , when @xmath110 the heat flux @xmath111 vanishes , a feature of the static disk .",
    "in precedent works @xcite we have presented a model for a conformastatic relativistic thin disk surrounded by a material electromagnetized halo from the kuzmin solution of the laplace s equation in the form @xmath112 as it is well known , @xmath113 must vanish everywhere except on the plane @xmath6 . at points with @xmath114 , @xmath115 is identical to the potential of a point mass @xmath116 located at the point @xmath117 , and when @xmath118 , @xmath115 coincides with the potential generated by a point mass at @xmath119 .",
    "accordingly , it is clear that @xmath115 is generated by the surface density of a newtonian mass @xmath120 in this work , we present a sort of generalisation of the kuzmin solution by considering a solution of the laplace s equation in the form @xcite , @xmath121 @xmath122 being the legendre polynomials in cylindrical coordinates that was derived in the present form by a direct comparison of the legendre polynomial expansion of the generating function with a taylor of @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "@xmath124 and @xmath125 arbitrary constant coefficients . the corresponding magnetic potential , obtained from ( [ eq : avarphi ] ) ,",
    "is @xmath126 where , we have imposed @xmath127 in order to preserve the regularity on the axis of symmetry .",
    "next , to introduce the corresponding discontinuity in the first - order derivatives of the metric potential and the magnetic potential required to define the disk we perform the transformation @xmath128 .",
    "thus , taking account of ( [ eq : observables+u ] ) , the surface energy density of the disk , the heat flux and the non - zero components of the anisotropic tensor are    @xmath129    and @xmath130 respectively . in the above expressions",
    "@xmath131 . as we know , the other quantities are @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the current of magnetization is @xmath134 where we have used ( [ eq : diskcurrent+u ] ) and we first assumed that the @xmath33-derivative of the magnetic potential present a finite discontinuity through the disk .",
    "in fact , as we have said above , the derivatives of @xmath63 and @xmath135 are continuous functions across of the surface of the disk .",
    "we artificially introduce the discontinuity through the transformation @xmath128 .    in order to illustrate the last solution we consider particular solutions with @xmath136 and @xmath137",
    ". then we have @xmath138 for the two first members of the family of the solutions as follows ,    @xmath139    where @xmath140 and @xmath141 whereas @xmath142 and @xmath143 . for the corresponding magnetic potentials we have then    @xmath144    where @xmath145 .",
    "@xmath146    in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] , we show the dimensionless surface energy densities @xmath147 as a function of @xmath148 . in each case , we plot @xmath149 [ fig .",

    "[ fig : figure1](b ) ] for different values of the parameter @xmath35 with @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "it can be seen that the surface energy density is everywhere positive fulfilling the energy conditions .",
    "it can be observed that for all the values of @xmath153 the maximum of the surface energy density occurs at the center of the disk and that it vanishes sufficiently fast as @xmath154 increases .",
    "it can also be observed that the surface energy density in the central region of the disk increases as the values of the parameter @xmath35 increase .",
    "@xmath155    in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2 ] , we show the dimensionless current of magnetization @xmath156 as a function of @xmath148 . in each case , we plot @xmath157 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2](a ) ] and @xmath158 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2](b ) ] for different values of the parameter @xmath35 with @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "it can be seen that the current of magnetization is everywhere positive .",
    "it can be observed that for all the values of @xmath153 the current of magnetization is zero at the center of the disk , increases rapidly as one moves away from the disk center , reaches a maximum and later decreases rapidly .",
    "it can also be observed that the maximum of the current of magnetization increases as the values of the parameter @xmath35 decrease .",
    "we also computed the functions @xmath159 and @xmath160 for other values of the parameters and , in all the cases , we found the same behaviour . we do not plot the heat flux",
    ", it shows a similar behaviour to that of the surface energy density . +",
    "before ending this section we evaluate the constants of motions . from ( [ eq : metricpot1 ] ) with @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath161",
    "we have @xmath162    then leading term in expansion ( [ eq : generalizedkuzmin ] ) @xmath163 determine adm mass of the spacetime @xcite @xmath164 its total angular momentum @xmath165 and the total magnetic dipole moment @xmath166 we thus see that constants @xmath54 and @xmath167 defines the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath168 .",
    "we have used the formalism presented in @xcite to obtain an exact relativistic model describing a system composed of a thin disk surrounded by a magnetized halo in a conformastationary space - time background .",
    "the model was obtained by solving the einstein - maxwell distributional field equations through the introduction of an auxiliary harmonic function that determines the functional dependence of the metric components and the electromagnetic potential under the assumption that the energy - momentum tensor can be expressed as the sum of two distributional contributions , one due to the electromagnetic part and the other due to a material part .",
    "as we can see , due to that the spacetime here considered is non - static ( conformastationary ) this distributional approach allows us a strongly non - linear partial equation system .",
    "we have considered for simplicity the astrophysical consistent case in that there is not electric charge on the halo region .",
    "consequently , it has been obtained that the charge density on the disk region is zero .    to analyse the physical content of the energy - momentum tensor of the disks we expressed it in the canonical form and we projected it in a comoving frame defined trough of the local observers tetrad .",
    "this analysis has allowed us to give a complete dynamical description of the system in terms of two parameters ( i.e @xmath35 and @xmath167 ) which determine the matter content of the disks .",
    "so , in this paper we presented for first time the complete analysis of the most general energy - momentum tensor of the disks that can be obtained from conformastationary axially symmetric solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "the expressions obtained here are the generalisations of the corresponding expressions for the conformastatic disks without isotropic pressure , stress tensor or heat flow presented in @xcite . indeed , when the parameter @xmath35 in the metric is equal to one the isotropic pressure and the anisotropic tensor on the material constituting the disks disappear . in a similar way , when the parameter @xmath73 is equal to zero the heat flux on the disk vanishes , a feature of the static systems .",
    "furthermore , when we take simultaneously @xmath169 and @xmath97 , the results here presented describe the energy - momentum tensor the disks presented in @xcite for the special case when the electric potential vanishes . moreover , to illustrate the application of the formalism we have considered specific solutions in which the gravitational and magnetic potential are completely determined by a `` generalization '' of the kuzmin solution of the laplace s equation .",
    "accordingly , we have obtained conformastationary magnetized thin disks of infinite radius , generated from a newtonian gravitational potential of a static axisymmetric distribution of matter .",
    "hence , when a particular value of the parameters @xmath170 is taken , the conformastatic disks without radial pressure presented in @xcite are obtained .",
    "since all the relevant quantities show a physically reasonable behaviour , we conclude that the solution presented here can be useful to describe the gravitational and electromagnetic field of a conformastationary thin disk surrounded by a halo in the presence of an electromagnetic field . in a subsequent work we will present a detailed analysis of the energy - momentum tensor of the halo as well as a thermodynamic analysis of the disk - halo .",
    "the author would like to thank the anonymous reviewer for their valuable comments and suggestions to improve the quality of the paper .",
    "the author also wishes to acknowledge useful discussions with c. s. lopez - monsalvo and h. quevedo .",
    "inspired by inverse method techniques , let us assume that the solution has the general form @xcite @xmath171 ,   \\label{eq : met0 }                               \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced the cylindrical coordinates @xmath172 in which the metric function @xmath173 and @xmath65 and the electromagnetic potential , @xmath174 depend only on @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
