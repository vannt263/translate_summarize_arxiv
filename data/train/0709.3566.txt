    "let @xmath1 be a compact , orientable @xmath2-manifold with a finite number of torus boundary components and suppose its interior admits a complete , finite volume hyperbolic metric . for each torus , there are an infinite number of topologically distinct ways to attach a solid torus , corresponding to the homotopy class of the non - trivial simple closed curve on the boundary torus that bounds a disk in the solid torus .",
    "the set of non - trivial simple closed curves on a torus is parametrized by pairs of relatively prime integers , once a basis for the fundamental group of the torus is chosen .",
    "if each torus is filled , the resulting manifold is closed .",
    "a fundamental theorem of thurston ( @xcite ) states that , for all but a finite number of filling curves on each boundary component , the resulting closed @xmath2-manifold has a hyperbolic structure .",
    "those that do nt result in a hyperbolic structure are called _ exceptional _ curves . in @xcite",
    "we showed that there is a universal bound to the number of curves that must be excluded from each boundary component ; in particular , when there is one boundary component , there are at most @xmath3 exceptional curves and when there are multiple boundary components , at most @xmath4 curves from each component need to be excluded .",
    "the proof of this result uses the harmonic deformation theory developed in @xcite to deform the finite volume complete hyperbolic structure on the interior of @xmath1 .",
    "the deformation consists of a family of singular hyperbolic metrics on the filled manifolds where the singularities lie along geodesics isotopic to the cores of the attached solid tori .",
    "the metrics on discs perpendicular to the geodesics have a single cone point at the geodesic with a cone angle @xmath5 which is constant along each component .",
    "we call such structures _ hyperbolic cone manifolds_. at the complete structure the cone angles are considered to be equal to @xmath6 and if the deformation reaches cone angles @xmath7 on each component , this is a smooth hyperbolic structure on the filled manifold .",
    "for the analytic techniques in @xcite to work , it is necessary to restrict all the cone angles to be at most @xmath7 . while this is adequate for the dehn filling problem , there are other situations where it is important to be able to deal with larger cone angles or with a more general type of singularity . in particular , in his proof of the bers density conjecture , bromberg ( @xcite , @xcite ) ( and then brock - bromberg ( @xcite ) for more general versions of the density conjecture ) needs to deform cone angles equal to @xmath8 back to @xmath7 . in order to have a similar deformation theory in this type of situation ,",
    "a new analytic technique is necessary .",
    "one of the primary goals of this paper is to provide such a technique . to this end",
    ", the previous analysis , which developed an @xmath9 hodge theory for the incomplete smooth metric on the complement of the singular locus , is replaced by a hodge theory on the compact hyperbolic manifold with boundary obtained by removing an open tubular neighborhood of the singular locus .",
    "we will now give a brief outline of this theory and some of its applications , as they are presented in the body of this paper .",
    "if one removes an equidistant tubular neighborhood of each component of the singular locus of a @xmath2-dimensional cone manifold , one obtains a smooth hyperbolic manifold with torus boundary components .",
    "the boundary tori have intrinsic flat metrics .",
    "furthermore , the principal normal curvatures are constant on each component , equal to @xmath10 ( where we assume that @xmath11 ) . if @xmath12 the lines of curvature are geodesics in the flat metric corresponding to the meridional and longitudinal directions .",
    "the normal curvatures and the tube radius , @xmath13 , are related by @xmath14 so they determine each other .",
    "we call tori with these curvature properties _ tubular_.    we say that an orientable hyperbolic @xmath2-manifold @xmath15 has _ tubular boundary _ if its boundary components are flat tori with constant principal normal curvatures as above . the interior of @xmath15 is known to also admit a _",
    "complete _ finite volume hyperbolic metric ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3.8 ) ) .",
    "associated to @xmath15 is a _ filled _ hyperbolic manifold @xmath16 .",
    "it is canonically obtained from @xmath15 by extending the hyperbolic structures on the boundary tori normally as far as possible .",
    "each added component is topologically a torus crossed with @xmath17 and is foliated by tubular tori whose radii go to zero .",
    "then @xmath16 is homeomorphic to the interior of @xmath15 and has a ( typically incomplete ) hyperbolic structure .",
    "the original manifold with tubular boundary @xmath15 is a subset of @xmath16 obtained by truncating the ends of @xmath16 along the appropriate tubular tori .",
    "note that @xmath16 contains many other manifolds with tubular boundary obtained by choosing other truncations .",
    "the geometry of the ends of the filled manifold @xmath16 is completely determined by the geometry of the tubular boundary tori of @xmath15 . in particular ,",
    "if , for a particular boundary component , the lines of curvature for the larger curvature @xmath18 are parallel closed curves , the completion of that end of @xmath16 will have the structure of a hyperbolic cone manifold with those curves as meridians around the singular locus .",
    "the resulting cone angles can be read off from the geometry of the boundary and can be arbitrarily large . in general ,",
    "these lines of curvature merely determine a foliation on the boundary torus where the leaves are geodesic in the flat metric on the torus .",
    "there is still a canonical way to extend the structure of the boundary torus in this case but the singular set for the completion will be a single point with a complicated neighborhood .",
    "the resulting structure obtained by completing @xmath16 , including both cone manifolds and this more general type of singularity , is called a hyperbolic structure with _ dehn surgery singularities_. ( see @xcite for details . )    fix a component @xmath19 of the boundary of a hyperbolic @xmath2-manifold @xmath15 with tubular boundary and consider the holonomy group of the fundamental group of that boundary torus .",
    "assume that @xmath20 ; then each element in the holonomy group will have an invariant axis .",
    "since the group is abelian , all of the elements fix a common axis in @xmath21 .",
    "choose a direction along the axis .",
    "then , associated to each element is a _ complex length _ whose real part is the signed translation distance along the axis and whose imaginary part is the total rotation around the axis .",
    "the amount of rotation is a well - defined real number whose sign is determined by the right hand rule .",
    "the map sending an element of @xmath22 to its complex length is linear and can be extended canonically to a linear map @xmath23 .",
    "the resulting value @xmath24 for any element @xmath25 will be called the complex length of @xmath26 .",
    "when the complex length of a _ simple _ closed curve @xmath27 on @xmath19 equals @xmath28 , this implies that the end of the filled manifold @xmath16 corresponding to @xmath19 completes to a smooth structure on the manifold @xmath29 obtained from @xmath15 by dehn filling with filling curve @xmath27 .",
    "more generally , if the complex length of @xmath27 equals @xmath30 , the end completes to a hyperbolic cone structure on @xmath29 with cone angle @xmath5 .",
    "now assume that the map @xmath23 is a ( real ) isomorphism .",
    "( this holds whenever the complex lengths of two generators of @xmath31 are linearly independent over the reals , a condition that holds whenever @xmath15 has tubular boundary with @xmath18 on @xmath19 . )",
    "then there will be a unique element @xmath25 so that @xmath32 ; we say that @xmath26 is the _ dehn surgery coefficient _ of the boundary component @xmath19 .",
    "when @xmath33 is a primitive element , it corresponds to a simple closed curve and the completion of the end is smooth . when it is in @xmath34 , the completed end has a cone singularity along a core geodesic .",
    "suppose , for simplicity , that @xmath15 has a single boundary component @xmath19 and denote by @xmath1 the underlying smooth manifold with boundary .",
    "then the subset of @xmath35 consisting of dehn surgery coefficients of hyperbolic structures with tubular boundary on @xmath1 is called the hyperbolic dehn surgery space for @xmath1 and will be denoted by @xmath36 .",
    "( note : in @xcite hyperbolic dehn surgery space is equivalently defined in terms of the filled in structures . ) thurston s theorem about the finiteness of exceptional curves is actually a corollary of his theorem that @xmath36 contains a neighborhood of infinity ( infinity here corresponds to the complete finite volume structure on the interior of @xmath1 ) .",
    "hence , it contains all but a finite number of points of the integral lattice @xmath37 .",
    "similar statements are proved when there are multiple boundary components .",
    "thurston s proof is not effective ; it gives no information about the size or shape of hyperbolic dehn surgery space which is why there is no information from his proof about the number of exceptional curves in his finiteness theorem .",
    "note that the vast majority of the points with integral entries are  near \" infinity and thus that the statement that @xmath38 contains a neighborhood of infinity is really a much stronger statement than the finiteness of exceptional fillings .",
    "one of the main goals of this paper is to provide an effective proof of thurston s result , one that will guarantee that @xmath38 contains a neighborhood of infinity of a  uniform \" size and shape . to simplify the description of this uniform region ,",
    "it is useful to put a metric on @xmath35 .",
    "one way to do this is to consider the complete structure on the interior of @xmath1 and take a horospherical torus @xmath19 embedded in its end .",
    "this torus inherits a flat metric which is well - defined up to scale .",
    "the homology group @xmath35 can be canonically identified with the universal cover of @xmath19 .",
    "so the flat metric on @xmath19 , normalized to have area @xmath39 , induces a flat metric on @xmath40 .",
    "note that under this identification , the distance from the origin to point @xmath41 is just the geodesic length of the corresponding closed curve @xmath27 on @xmath19 measured with respect to the flat metric on @xmath19 , normalized to have area @xmath39 .",
    "this is called the _ normalized length _ of @xmath27 on @xmath19 . as with complex length",
    "this notion of length can be extended naturally to define a map @xmath42 ; the value @xmath43 is called the normalized length of @xmath26 .",
    "the theorem below says that , using this metric on the plane , @xmath36 always contains the complement of a disk of uniform radius around the origin , _ independent _ of @xmath1 .",
    "[ shapethm ] consider a complete , finite volume hyperbolic structure on the interior of a compact , orientable @xmath2-manifold @xmath1 with one torus boundary component .",
    "let @xmath19 be a horospherical torus which is embedded as a cross - section to the cusp of the complete structure .",
    "consider @xmath36 as a subset of @xmath40 where the latter is endowed with the euclidean metric induced from the universal cover of @xmath19 with its flat metric scaled to have unit area .",
    "then @xmath36 contains the complement of a disk of radius @xmath44 , centered at the origin .",
    "equivalently , any @xmath25 whose normalized length @xmath45 is bigger than @xmath44 is in @xmath36 .",
    "in @xcite we showed that any simple closed curve @xmath27 on @xmath19 , viewed as an element of @xmath31 , whose normalized length is at least @xmath46 is in @xmath47 .",
    "thus , except for the slight change in constant ( which is due to the tube radius condition required for the hodge theorem , as discussed below ) , theorem [ shapethm ] is a direct generalization of that result .",
    "the normalized length condition translates easily into an upper bound on the number of exceptional fillings .",
    "the proof of theorem [ shapethm ] , like the proof of the uniform bound on exceptional fillings , involves two main steps .",
    "first , it is necessary to show that one can deform a given structure towards the desired structure .",
    "for example , in the cone manifold case , one needs to show that the cone angles can always be increased a small amount .",
    "this step depends on proving a local parametrization theorem , showing that , locally , the deformations are parametrized by their dehn surgery coefficients . in order to find such a local parametrization ,",
    "one proves a local rigidity theorem which says that it is impossible to deform the hyperbolic structure while keeping the dehn surgery coefficients fixed .",
    "the local parametrization then follows by an application of the implicit function theorem .",
    "the second step is to show that , under certain initial conditions , it is always possible to deform the complete structure on the interior of @xmath1 , through hyperbolic structures with tubular boundary , to one with the desired dehn surgery coefficient before there is any degeneration of the hyperbolic structure .",
    "this step requires one to control the change in geometry under the deformation and depends on the analysis in the proof of local rigidity .",
    "the proofs of the local rigidity and local parametrization theorems require new analytic techniques and occupy the next three sections .",
    "once these are established , the arguments to establish uniform bounds closely follow those in @xcite",
    ". however , the use of manifolds with tubular boundary , as opposed to cone manifolds , leads to subtly different estimates when there are multiple boundary components .    for a compact , orientable , @xmath2-manifold @xmath1 with multiple torus boundary components @xmath48",
    ", the dehn surgery space is a subset of @xmath49 and the dehn surgery coefficient @xmath50 is determined by the dehn surgery coefficients @xmath51 for each torus . for @xmath51",
    "the normalized length @xmath52 is computed on a horospherical torus corresponding to @xmath53 in the complete structure on the interior of @xmath1 as described above . in this case",
    "we prove the following uniform statement :    [ multipleshapethm ] consider a complete , finite volume hyperbolic structure on the interior of a compact , orientable @xmath2-manifold @xmath1 with @xmath54 torus boundary components .",
    "let @xmath48 be horospherical tori which are embedded as cross - sections to the cusps of the complete structure .",
    "consider @xmath36 as a subset of @xmath49 .",
    "then there exists a universal constant @xmath55 such that @xmath56 is in @xmath36 provided the normalized lengths @xmath57 satisfy @xmath58    when @xmath59 this is precisely the same statement as that of theorem [ shapethm ] . in the multiple cusp case",
    ", it again gives a uniform upper bound on the number of exceptional simple closed curves that need to be excluded from each boundary component so that the remaining dehn filled manifolds are necessarily hyperbolic .",
    "however , it should be noted that the bound depends on the number of boundary components .",
    "this is in contrast to theorem 5.12 in @xcite which provides a uniform bound independent of the number of cusps .",
    "the reason for this difference is that in the previous paper we allow the possibility of increasing the cone angles at varying rates .",
    "once a cone angle of @xmath7 is attained on one component of the singular locus , it is no longer changed , while the other angles are increased .",
    "we no longer keep track of the geometry in a neighborhood of the smooth core geodesics .",
    "( indeed , a geodesic could become non - simple and change isotopy class . )",
    "this was not adequately explained in @xcite ; for a discussion of this and other subtler issues that arise in the multiple cusp case , the reader may consult @xcite .    in the current paper , we require a lower bound on the tube radius of all the tubular boundary components throughout the deformation .",
    "this is because , even at the final dehn surgery coefficient , the filled manifold may still have singularities , and thus we no longer have the luxury of ignoring the tube radius around a component once its desired surgery coefficient is attained .",
    "we always move radially in @xmath36 from the complete structure to the desired dehn surgery coefficients ( which , when all the coefficients correspond to simple closed curves , amounts to increasing the cone angles at equal rates ) .",
    "this provides weaker estimates in the case of multiple cusps .",
    "it does , however , have the advantage in the case of smooth dehn filling ( or cone manifolds ) that the isotopy class of the union of the core geodesics will necessarily remain unchanged .",
    "we also obtain good control on the change in geometry during generalized hyperbolic dehn filling .",
    "theorem [ geomthm ] gives explicit upper and lower bounds for the volume and core geodesic length , with the asymptotic behavior given by neumann - zagier in @xcite .",
    "these bounds are illustrated in figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] at the end of the paper .",
    "for example , we obtain the following numerical bound .    let @xmath60 be a compact , orientable @xmath2-manifold as in theorem [ multipleshapethm ] , and let @xmath61 denote the volume of the complete hyperbolic structure on the interior of @xmath60 .",
    "let @xmath62 be a surgery coefficient with normalized lengths @xmath63 satisfying @xmath64 and let @xmath65 be the filled hyperbolic manifold with dehn surgery coefficient @xmath26 .",
    "then the decrease in volume @xmath66 during hyperbolic dehn filling is at most @xmath67 .",
    "we now briefly explain how the use of manifolds with tubular boundary allows us to avoid the analytic issues that led to the cone angle restriction in @xcite .",
    "the original local rigidity theory in @xcite applies only to hyperbolic @xmath2-manifolds with conical singularities along a geodesic link where the cone angles are restricted to be at most @xmath7 .",
    "the argument involves finding , for any infinitesimal deformation of the hyperbolic cone structure , a harmonic representative and then utilizing a weitzenbck formula for such harmonic infinitesimal deformations .",
    "the analysis using this formula involves an integration by parts on the complement of a tubular neighborhood of the singular locus , resulting in a term from the boundary of the tubular neighborhood .",
    "any deformation for which this boundary term goes to zero as the radius of the tube goes to zero is seen to be trivial .",
    "the main step in @xcite is to show that , for any infinitesimal deformation where all the cone angles are held constant , the boundary term does , indeed , go to zero as long as the cone angles are at most @xmath7 .",
    "the fact that the analysis involves arbitrarily small neighborhoods of the singular locus means that it depends on the asymptotic behavior of harmonic deformations near the singular locus .",
    "this behavior is strongly governed by the value of the cone angle along the singular locus .    to avoid a dependence on the local behavior near the singular locus ,",
    "it is necessary to work on the complement of a tubular neighborhood whose tube radius is bounded below .",
    "again , one must find a harmonic representative for the infinitesimal deformation of the hyperbolic structure with tubular boundary .",
    "since these infinitesimal deformations can be viewed as cohomology classes , this can be viewed as hodge theory on a manifold with boundary . in this case , when one uses the weitzenbck formula and integration by parts , one wants to end up with a boundary term with an appropriate sign .",
    "when such a boundary term is obtained , the conclusion is again that the deformation is trivial , implying a local rigidity theorem as before .",
    "thus , a hodge theory must be developed with the boundary term from the weitzenbck formula in mind . to this end",
    ", we find a formula for this term in section [ weitz ] .",
    "the formula derived there is quite general and is valid for any hyperbolic 3-manifold with boundary , not just those with tubular boundary . as a result",
    ", it should have applications in other contexts and may be of independent interest .",
    "the form of this weitzenbck boundary term motivates the specific boundary conditions we require for our hodge representative when the manifold has tubular boundary .",
    "the proof that the corresponding boundary value problem can always be uniquely solved is contained in section [ bvalues ] .",
    "this result requires a universal lower bound on the tube radius of the tubular boundary components . by definition the _ tube radius _ @xmath13 of a tubular boundary component is determined by the formula @xmath68 , where @xmath11 is the larger of the two principal curvatures on that component .",
    "when @xmath69 ( which corresponds to a horospherical torus ) , the tube radius is said to be infinite .",
    "once the required hodge theorem is proved , similar arguments to those in @xcite imply the following local rigidity and local parametrization result .",
    "the previous cone angle restriction has been removed and is replaced by a mild restriction on the tube radius . for simplicity , we also assume that all tube radii are finite .",
    "[ bdrylocalparam ] let @xmath15 be a compact , orientable hyperbolic 3-manifold with tubular boundary and suppose that the tube radius of each boundary component is finite and at least @xmath70 then there are no deformations of the hyperbolic structure fixing the dehn surgery coefficient of @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , the nearby hyperbolic structures with tubular boundary are parametrized by their dehn surgery coefficients . in particular ,",
    "a finite volume hyperbolic cone - manifold with singularities along a link and tube radii at least @xmath71 has no deformations of the hyperbolic structure keeping the cone angles fixed , and the nearby hyperbolic cone - manifold structures are parametrized by their cone angles .",
    "once this analytic theory for hyperbolic manifolds with tubular boundary is developed and the above local rigidity theorem is proved , the arguments in @xcite go through with minor changes . indeed , much of that paper was written in the context of manifolds with tubular boundary , once the necessary analytic and geometric control was derived .",
    "these arguments are recalled in section [ applic ] , where they are then applied to prove theorems [ shapethm ] and [ multipleshapethm ] and other results .",
    "in this section we recall the basic setup for the harmonic deformation theory of hyperbolic structures on @xmath2-manifolds .",
    "the reader is referred to the papers @xcite and @xcite for details , and to @xcite for a survey of the theory and its applications .",
    "an infinitesimal deformation of a hyperbolic structure on a hyperbolic @xmath2-manifold @xmath15 is given by a cohomology class in @xmath72 where is @xmath73 is the bundle of ( germs of ) infinitesimal isometries of @xmath21 . by viewing this cohomology group in terms of de rham cohomology",
    ", such a cohomology class can be represented by a @xmath39-form with values in @xmath73 .",
    "the @xmath39-form will be closed with respect to the @xmath73-valued exterior derivative which we denote by @xmath74 .",
    "a representative for a cohomology class can be altered by a coboundary without changing its cohomology class .",
    "an @xmath73-valued @xmath39-form is a coboundary precisely when it can be expressed as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is an @xmath73-valued @xmath6-form , i.e. a _ global _ section of @xmath73 .",
    "a standard method for choosing a particularly nice representative in a cohomology class is to find a _",
    "harmonic _ representative : one that is co - closed as well as closed . on a closed manifold",
    "such a harmonic representative is unique . when the manifold is non - compact or has boundary , it is necessary to choose asymptotic or boundary conditions to guarantee existence and uniqueness .",
    "when @xmath15 is a hyperbolic @xmath2-manifold with tubular boundary , one can begin with a representative @xmath77 that has a special form in a neighborhood of the boundary . in @xcite , when @xmath15 is a hyperbolic cone manifold , specific closed @xmath73-valued @xmath39-forms , which we call _ standard forms _ , are defined in a neighborhood of the singular locus .",
    "the same forms are defined in the neighborhood of the boundary components of a general hyperbolic manifold with tubular boundary .",
    "they have the property that any possible infinitesimal change in the holonomy representation of the fundamental group of a boundary torus can be induced by one of these forms . as a result , by standard cohomology theory , for any infinitesimal deformation of the hyperbolic cone manifold structure ,",
    "it is possible to find a closed @xmath73-valued @xmath39-form @xmath78 on @xmath15 which equals one of these standard forms in a neighborhood of each torus boundary .",
    "the standard forms are harmonic so the @xmath73-valued @xmath39-form @xmath78 will be harmonic in a neighborhood of the boundary but not generally harmonic on all of @xmath15 . since it represents a cohomology class in @xmath79 , it will be closed as an @xmath73-valued @xmath39-form , but it wo nt generally be co - closed . if we denote by @xmath80 the adjoint of the exterior derivative , @xmath74 , on @xmath73-valued forms , then this means that @xmath81 , but @xmath82 in general .",

    "the fibers of the bundle @xmath73 are all isomorphic to the lie algebra @xmath86 of the lie group of isometries of hyperbolic space .",
    "one special feature of the 3-dimensional case is the _ complex structure _ on the lie algebra @xmath87 .",

    "since @xmath84 and @xmath78 is standard in a neighborhood of the boundary , our boundary term will have a contribution from the standard form , which is quite explicit , and from the correction term @xmath75 .",
    "the behavior of the latter depends on our choice of boundary condition when solving ( [ taueqn ] ) . a major consideration",
    "when choosing a boundary condition is that the contribution to the weitzenbck boundary term from the correction term @xmath75 be non - positive .    in section [ weitz ]",
