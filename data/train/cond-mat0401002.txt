    "[ figtl ] we deduce the size of the fluctuation region consistent with the previous estimate in terms of @xmath50 and relation @xmath211 , i.e. it is about @xmath212 on the superfluid side and @xmath213 on the normal side . amazingly , in temperature plots for @xmath214 and @xmath215 one may not even distinguish between the mf theory and numerical data on large scale ; only in the inset which covers just the fluctuation region we can see that the mf curve goes wrong very close to @xmath20 .",
    "we also verify the prediction of the self - consistent theory @xcite for the critical amplitude of the condensate density .",
    "as mentioned previously , the self - consistent theory makes predictions for the critical region as well ; the relation between the condensate density and reduced temperature is derived as [ see eq .",
    "( 18 ) in ref .  ]",
    "@xmath216 with @xmath217 .",
    "the condensate density exponent is accurate , though the derivation was done assuming that the self - energy behaves as @xmath218 instead of the true critical behavior @xmath219 with @xmath220 ( see ref .   and the discussion below ) .",
    "since @xmath221 the amplitude in the critical law @xmath222 is directly related to the value of @xmath223 in eq .",
    "( [ a0 ] ) @xmath224 in disagreement with the theory by a factor of two .    to characterize the fluctuation region in terms of the gas parameter @xmath225 we identically rewrite @xmath226",
    "the coefficient in the denominator is too large to be ignored even in qualitative estimates .",
    "it was mentioned in ref .   that bose gases should demonstrate universal properties only at @xmath227 .",
    "this statement is unambiguously confirmed by the present study , since for larger values of @xmath228 the fluctuation region in temperature is already of order @xmath20 itself .",
    "the other identical way of writing @xmath208 is @xmath229 obviously , the idea of universality is meaningful only if it is possible to separate ideal - gas short - wavelength physics from strongly coupled long - wavelength fluctuations , i.e. when @xmath230 , and thus , according to eq .",
    "( [ zk ] ) , the fluctuation region in reduced temperature is small .    in a typical experiment with ultracold gases",
    "the parameter @xmath231 is as small as @xmath232 , and the system may be considered as weakly interacting .",
    "the interaction induced critical temperature shift in the homogeneous system is very small ( the corresponding critical density shift is given by eq .",
    "( [ nc ] ) and is only about 1% for @xmath233 ) and is difficult to study experimentally .",
    "this does _ not _ imply , however , that all non - perturbative effects in the vicinity of the critical point are of academic interest as well .",
    "the quantity directly relevant to the experimental setup is @xmath53 since it describes , according to eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) , the density profile in the trapping potential if it is smooth enough to guarantee the hydrostatic regime .",
    "in this regime the density variation over the mode - coupling radius @xmath234 reduces to @xmath235 , where @xmath236 is the homogeneous equation of state , @xmath237 , and @xmath238 is the trapping potential .",
    "it follows from figs .",
    "[ figt ] and [ figtinset ] that the `` cusp '' on the density profile does _ not _ coincide with the point where the condensate first appears , but is slightly shifted to the perimeter of the trap .",
    "moreover , by fitting experimental data away from the `` cusp '' using mf equations , one may directly measure the interaction induced universal chemical potential shift [ through @xmath239 .",
    "the variation of the @xmath104-function across the fluctuation region is about @xmath240 , which transforms into density variation of order @xmath241 or a @xmath242 strong effect for @xmath243 ! in fig .",
    "[ trap ] we show the density profile in a smooth parabolic trap @xmath244 when the condensate density in the middle of the trap is comparable to the critical density .",
    "amazingly , in this situation the fluctuation region extends all the way from the critical point to the trap center , and the mf theory completely fails to describe the superfluid side .",
    "thus , the non - perturbative physics of the fluctuation region and the prediction that it is completely characterized by the classical field theory can be studied even by experimenting with very dilute gases , @xmath245 . as fig .",
    "[ trap ] clearly demonstrates , all effects in the middle of the trap are strong .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that in the fluctuation region the density profile can _ not _ be decomposed into the sum of the smoothly varying , monotonic non - condensate density background and the condensate density bump .",
    "the normalized condensate density in fig .",
    "[ trap ] increases faster then @xmath246 , and the naive `` decomposition '' technique would underestimate the actual condensate density by almost a factor of two .    for the quasi - homogenenous description to work ,",
    "it is necessary to keep the external potential gradients small .",
    "if the chemical potential in the middle of the trap corresponds to @xmath247 , then the critical point is located at a distance @xmath248 .",
    "the hydrostatic approach can be used when @xmath249 , or @xmath250 for the parameters in fig .",
    "[ trap ] we need then @xmath251 a condition easily satisfied experimentally @xcite . the crucial point is then in achieving the necessary spatial resolution in shallow traps .",
    "our final result concerns the universal part of the self - energy at the critical point @xcite .",

    "is calculated automatically as the central part of the numerical scheme @xcite , and thus @xmath259 is readily available . in fig .",
    "[ figsss ] we plot the universal part of the occupation number distribution as @xmath260 $ ] versus @xmath261 ( in the inset we plot @xmath262 $ ] versus @xmath261 , i.e. subtracting the leading bare spectrum dependence ) for the system size @xmath169 and see the crossover between the free particle , @xmath263 , and the u(1 ) critical , @xmath264 , behavior at @xmath265 .",
    "the smallest values of @xmath266 are effected by finite size effects and are not shown in the inset ( in finite systems @xmath267 is finite at the critical point ) .",
    "the correlation function exponent is known very accurately @xcite @xmath268 , and we consider it as known ( our data are consistent with this value ) . clearly , very little changes occur in the structure of the @xmath269 expression across the fluctuation region .",
