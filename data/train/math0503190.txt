    "we consider compact connected surfaces properly embedded in compact orientable irreducible @xmath0-manifolds with single toral boundary , which are _ essential _ , meaning that incompressible and boundary - incompressible .",
    "the boundary of such a surface consists of a parallel family of non - trivial simple closed curves .",
    "thus they determine a _ slope _ , that is , the isotopy class of non - trivial simple closed curves .",
    "this slope is called the _ boundary slope _ of the surface .",
    "boundary slopes of essential surfaces have been well - studied , especially , in a relation to the study of dehn surgery on knots .",
    "recall that , for the knot exteriors in the @xmath0-sphere @xmath1 , the set of slopes is usually identified with the set of rational numbers with the infinity @xmath2 . in fact , such an identification can be done by using the standard meridian - longitude system .",
    "see @xcite for example .    in this paper , we study numerical properties of the boundary slopes , regarded as rational numbers , for _ montesinos knots _ ; the knots composed by a number of rational tangles .",
    "precisely , the aim of this paper is : to give ( 1 ) an upper bound on the denominator of a boundary slope and ( 2 ) an upper bound on differences between two boundary slopes for a montesinos knot exterior .",
    "our bounds are actually described in terms of the euler characteristic and some other topological quantity of the surfaces .    for montesinos knot exteriors ,",
    "hatcher and oertel studied the boundary slopes in @xcite intensively .",
    "they gave an algorithm , based on the arguments developed originally in @xcite , to list all essential surfaces up for a given montesinos knot exterior .",
    "their algorithm has somehow combinatorial workings , and in fact , was implemented to a computer program by dunfield described in @xcite . by using this program ,",
    "we had performed computer - aided experiments , and got some observations which suggest the existence of such numerical properties for the boundary slopes .",
    "this is the motivation of our study .    in the following ,",
    "let @xmath3 be a montesinos knot @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number of tangles and each @xmath6 is a non - integral rational number .",
    "we first give an upper bound on the denominators of boundary slopes for montesinos knot exteriors .",

    "some boundary slopes for the knot only satisfies a weaker bound @xmath14 though a stronger condition @xmath15 on the number of boundary components holds in these cases .    here",

    "furthermore , there are no non - torus montesinos knots whose exterior contains essential planar surfaces .",
    "thus non - torus montesinos knots admit no reducible surgery .",
    "the last statement assures that the well - known cabling conjecture is true for montesinos knots directly .",
    "this fact has already been achieved in @xcite as a corollary of the result for strongly invertible knots .",
    "the next corollary is the non - orientable version of the above . recall that a non - orientable surface is called of _ non - orientable genus _",

    "we next give an upper bound on the  difference \" between two boundary slopes for montesinos knot exteriors by a linear function of the ratio @xmath31 of the negative of the euler characteristic of the surface and the number of sheets .",

    "however , in the algorithm of hatcher and oertel , @xmath45 and @xmath35 play significant roles rather than @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . hence , in the light of the algorithm , it seems natural to consider the difference @xmath37 and @xmath49 .",

    "the proofs of both theorem [ thm : denom : upperbound : main ] and [ thm : diff : upperbound : main ] deeply depend on the algorithm in @xcite .",
    "hence , in this section , we review its workings of enumerating all boundary slopes .      as mentioned in the introduction , we assume that the knot @xmath3 is a montesinos knot @xmath59 , where each @xmath6 is a non - integral fraction and @xmath5 in this article . by the assumption ,",
    "we normalize montesinos knots and eliminate two - bridge knots from the argument .",
