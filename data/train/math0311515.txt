    "a variety of numerical methods have been developed for scattering simulations .",
    "these include finite difference methods ( fdm ) ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , finite element methods ( fem ) ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , integral equation methods ( iem ) ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and methods based on fast fourier transforms ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and fast multipole expansions ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "+ each of these have advantages and shortcomings .",
    "for instance , fdm and fem result in sparse matrices which can , therefore , be easily applied and inverted .",
    "moreover , fdm can be implemented with relative ease .",
    "these methods however are typically tied to regular grids which prevents the attainment of high order convergence for arbitrarily shaped obstacles . in contrast , fem , while more difficult to implement than its fdm counterparts can easily handle complex geometries , a feature that , in fact , largely justifies its popularity . a main disadvantage of the fem approach ( also shared by fdm ) , on the other hand , is related to the _ exterior _ nature of scattering problem . indeed",
    ", this implies that the physical _ radiation conditions _ must be translated into conditions that allow for a finite computational domain .",
    "although exact boundary conditions can be found @xcite , they are non local ( in space and time ) . for this reason , great effort has gone into the design of approximate local boundary conditions ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) that minimize spurious reflections .",
    "to achieve this , however , the conditions must typically be imposed at a certain distance from the scatterer , leading to increased computational times and memory requirements .",
    "+ integral equation methods , on the other hand , do not suffer from this problem , as they are based on integral formulas which implicitly account for radiation conditions through the use of _ outgoing _ green s functions .",
    "these methods , however , typically lead to a linear system involving a full matrix and thus they are not competitive unless a specialized strategy is used to accelerate matrix - vector products . examples of accelerated iem include those based on ffts ( @xcite , @xcite ) and those that use fast multipole expansions ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , however , to date no implementation of these exists that can attain higher than first or second order of convergence .",
    "+ in this paper , we present a new integral equation approach to scattering simulations , especially designed to treat penetrable bodies of revolution . in the spirit of methods based on ffts , our approach attains its efficiency through the use of fast legendre transforms ( flts ) .",
    "in contrast with classical methods , however , our scheme can be made to converge with arbitrarily large order .",
    "this important additional property is achieved using ideas inspired by work in @xcite and @xcite on two - dimensional scattering . as in @xcite",
    "we use the _ addition theorem _ in the integral equation to derive a scheme whose convergence rate is tied to the global smoothness of the refractive index / sound velocity ; for globally smooth characteristics , for instance , it converges spectrally .",
    "the contribution of this paper is to get the high order convergence of axisymmetric case in 3-d with two dimensional cost using flts .",
    "as we mentioned , we are interested in the prediction of electromagnetic and acoustic scattering returns .",
    "helmholtz equation arises naturally in acoustics and we shall concentrate on scattering problems for such models . although our results will not be directly applicable to electromagnetics ,",
    "they do suggest a strategy to follow in this case , as the corresponding integral equations are similar in structure to those that arise in connection with the helmholtz model .",
    "we will consider the case when the inhomogeneity is of compact support and the region under consideration is in @xmath2 .",
    "a bounded scatterer @xmath3 is contained within a radius @xmath4 from the origin .",
    "the refractive index @xmath5 varies arbitrarily in @xmath3 and n(x)=1 outside the scatterer .",
    "thus , setting m(x)=@xmath6 we have m(x)=0 for x outside @xmath3 and a scattered field @xmath7 will be generated by an incident field @xmath8 satisfying the linearized equations in free space    @xmath9    the total field @xmath10 will then satisfy    @xmath11    with appropriate conditions at infinity .",
    "the physically relevant condition is the _ sommerfeld radiation condition _ which guarantees that the scattered field is outgoing , @xmath12    in fact , as we mentioned , this last condition constitutes one of the central challenges in the design of accurate numerical methods , especially if it must be approximated ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "such approximations , however , can be avoided in an integral formulation of the problem that explicitly accounts for the outgoing character of the solution . indeed , suppose @xmath13 is a solution of ( [ 2])-([3 ] ) and let @xmath14 denote the free - space outgoing green s function .",
    "let @xmath15 be an arbitrary point and choose an open ball @xmath16 of radius r with exterior unit normal @xmath17 containing the support of @xmath18 and such that @xmath19 .",
    "then , we arrive at the @xmath20 which is equivalent to ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) , @xmath21 where @xmath16 is any ball containing the support of @xmath18 .",
    "a convenient form of the lippmann - schwinger equation can be derived if we appeal to the addition theorem . the addition theorem ( see @xcite ) states that @xmath22 \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the associated legendre functions ( @xmath26 are the legendre polynomials ) .",
    "the series and its term by term first derivatives with respect to @xmath27 and @xmath28 are absolutely convergent on compact subsets of @xmath29 .",
    "+ therefore , we obtain , using the addition theorem and lemma , that @xmath30\\\\   &    \\cdot u\\cdot m \\cdot \\rho^2 \\sin\\theta\\,d\\rho d\\theta d\\varphi,\\\\ \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath31    if the incoming ray and the obstacle are axisymmetric then , by uniqueness @xcite , the solution @xmath32 of ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) will be axisymmetric",
    ". then ( [ 7 ] ) simplifies to @xmath33    finally , expanding @xmath32 and @xmath8 in legendre series we obtain    @xmath34    from which the axisymmetric formulation @xmath35 follows .",
    "to implement ( [ 10 ] ) numerically , we approximate @xmath32 and @xmath18 by a truncated legendre series @xmath36 @xmath37        the formulation ( [ 10 ] ) thus reduces to @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xmath44 . to solve ( [ 12 ] ) , we shall appeal to an iterative method , e.g. , gmres , which reduces the overall problem to the fast evaluation of @xmath45 in ( [ 12 ] ) . to achieve the latter we propose below an efficient strategy to calculate the angular integration in ( [ 14 ] ) and the subsequent radial integration in ( [ 13 ] ) .",
    "a natural approach to the evaluation of ( [ 14 ] ) is to exploit the orthogonality of the legendre polynomials by expanding the function @xmath46 in legendre series for fixed @xmath47 .",
    "this , of course , demands that we calculate the _ legendre transform _",
    "@xmath48 @xmath49 which , in principle , requires @xmath50 operations ( for fixed @xmath47 ) .",
    "fortunately , however , algorithms have been designed for the fast evaluation of the map @xmath51 where @xmath52 and its inverse , for appropriate choices of the angles @xmath53 ; see appendix .",
    "these algorithms , which we shall refer to as _ fast legendre transform _ ( flt ) and _ inverse fast legendre transform _ ( iflt ) , then suggest an implementation of the angular integration in the form                @xmath61\\\\ & \\widetilde{y_n}(\\rho):=\\frac{\\rho^{n+1}}{-1\\cdot1\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot\\dots(2n-1)}y_n(\\rho)= \\bigg[1-\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\rho^2}{1!(1 - 2n)}+\\frac{({\\frac{1}{2}\\rho^2})^2}{2!(1 - 2n)(3 - 2n)}+\\dots \\bigg]\\\\ \\end{split}\\ ] ]    then , the equation ( [ 18 ] ) becomes @xmath62 \\\\   & + \\widetilde{j_n}(ka)(ka)^n\\int\\limits_{0}^{\\mathbf r}\\ ! \\frac{(k\\rho)^n(-2n-1)k^3}{1\\cdot3 ^ 2\\cdot5 ^ 2\\dots ( 2n+1)^2}\\widetilde{j_n}(k\\rho)i_{n}(\\rho)\\rho^2\\,d\\rho . \\\\",
