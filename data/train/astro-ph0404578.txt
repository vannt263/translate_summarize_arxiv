    "* paper i , hereafter kn ) presented new observational characteristics of fundamental mode cepheids obtained from an analysis of the galactic cepheid data and the ogle lmc / smc cepheid data .",
    "these were the period - colour ( pc ) and the amplitude - colour ( ac ) relations at maximum , mean and minimum light .",
    "kn analyzed these pc and ac diagrams in the context of the work of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter skm ) , who used the stefan - boltzmann law and the fact that radius fluctuations are small in cepheids , to derive the following equation , valid for optical pulsations of cepheid variables :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the photospheric temperature at maximum or minimum light . consequently ,",
    "if for some reason the pc relation is flat at maximum light , and the colour used is a good predictor of temperature , then equation ( 1 ) predicts a relationship between @xmath4 band amplitude and @xmath5 , and thus a correlation between the @xmath4 band amplitude and the observed colour ( after extinction correction ) at minimum @xmath4 band light .",
    "@xcite found that galactic cepheids exhibit a spectral type that is independent of period at maximum light .",
    "skm analyzed existing galactic cepheid data to show that higher amplitude galactic cepheids are indeed driven to cooler temperatures , and thus redder @xmath6 colours , at minimum light in accordance with equation ( 1 ) and the observational findings of @xcite .",
    "the reason why galactic cepheids follow a spectral type that is independent of period at maximum light was explained in skm : it is due to the interaction of the photosphere with the hydrogen ionization front ( hif ) . at maximum light ,",
    "the hif is so far out in the mass distribution that the photosphere , taken to be optical depth 2/3 , occurs right at the base of the hif .",
    "together with the hif is a sharp rise in opacity . at this point",
    ", the mean free path goes to zero . in the absence of any significant",
    "driving , even though the surrounding atmosphere has a non - zero inward velocity , this opacity wall prevents the photosphere from going deeper in the star and erases any `` memory '' of global stellar conditions .",
    "thus for a large range of periods , the photosphere occurs at the base of the hif at maximum light at a temperature which is independent of period . at maximum light , this leads to a flat relation between period & temperature , period & @xmath6 colour and period & spectral type , as seen in skm . at other phases ,",
    "the hif lies too far inside the mass distribution to interact with the photosphere .",
    "this , together with equation ( 1 ) , implies a relation between amplitude and @xmath6 colour or temperature at minimum light .",
    "equation ( 1 ) suggests that if @xmath5 obeyed a flat relation with period , then there should be a relation between amplitude and colour at maximum light .",
    "hence pc relations are connected to ac relations , and changes in the pc relations should be reflected in corresponding changes in the ac relations .",
    "because of the extensive data now available , kn analyzed recent galactic and magellanic cloud cepheid data in terms of pc and ac diagrams at maximum , mean and minimum light . using @xmath0 colours",
    ", they performed a more detailed analysis of the galactic cepheid data and found that the galactic pc relation at maximum light displayed a statistically significant break at 10 days , but was consistent with a single line at mean and minimum light . in the lmc ,",
    "the pc relation displayed this break at all three phases , though the statistical significance at maximum light was marginal .",
    "the smc pc relation displayed similar properties to that in the galaxy .",
    "analysis of the galactic cepheid data in terms of ac diagrams confirmed the work of skm , and extended it to the case of @xmath0 colour : there is a relation between amplitude and @xmath0 colour at minimum @xmath4 band light .",
    "for the lmc , short period cepheids ( @xmath7 ) show no relation between @xmath4 band amplitude and @xmath0 colour at minimum light , but long period cepheids ( @xmath8 ) are such that higher amplitude stars are driven to redder @xmath0 colours and hence cooler temperatures at minimum light . at maximum light , short period cepheids are such that higher amplitude stars are driven to bluer @xmath0 colours and hence hotter temperatures but long period cepheids do not show such a relation .    an understanding of the pc and ac relations derived by kn are important , not only for stellar pulsation and evolution studies of cepheids , but also because the cepheid period - luminosity ( pl ) relation depends on the pc relation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * )",
    ". the pl relation will reflect significant changes in the pc relation .",
    "hence in studying pc and ac relations in different galaxies , we are studying the universality of the cepheid pl relation .",
    "recent work by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have suggested that the pl relation in the galaxy is significantly different from that in the lmc and , further , that the pl relation in the lmc is non - linear .",
    "in contrast , current observations indicate that the galactic pl relation is linear @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this and subsequent papers is to confront these new observed characteristics of cepheids with the latest stellar pulsation models and interpret the results in terms of the theory presented in skm , which has been summarized above .",
    "this approach will ultimately yield a qualitatively deeper understanding some of the reasons behind the variation of the cepheid pl relation from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "our ultimate goal is to use our theoretical models to estimate the effect of this variation quantitatively . for this paper",
    "we concentrate on galactic cepheid models which we compare with the same galactic cepheid data used in kn .",
    "the lmc / smc cepheid models will be presented in the forthcoming papers in this series .",
    "our models and methods improve upon those in skm in the following respects : first of all , they contain a formulation to model time dependent turbulent convection @xcite , in contrast to the purely radiative models used in skm .",
    "in addition , we construct more models so that we can examine in greater detail the pc and ac characteristics of cepheids .",
    "secondly , we investigate the pulsation properties as a function of other phase points . when investigating pc and ac relations at mean light , kn defined mean @xmath0 colour as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the @xmath4 band magnitude closest to the value of @xmath11 , the mean magnitude obtained from a fourier decomposition , and @xmath12 is the @xmath13 band magnitude at this same phase .",
    "the reason for doing this is because the colour of the star at a certain phase is precisely the @xmath4 band magnitude minus the @xmath13 band magnitude at that same phase .",
    "in contrast , a definition of mean colour such as @xmath14 folds in the phase difference ( albeit small ) that exists between the @xmath4 and @xmath13 band light curves .",
    "we adopt the definitions given in kn for colour at maximum , mean and minimum light",
    ". however , there are two phases when the @xmath4 band magnitude is closest to the value of @xmath11 : once on the ascending branch and once on the descending branch of the light curve .",
    "the colour ( or the temperature ) , in both models and theory , need not necessary be the same at these two phases . in kn s analysis of the observed data , the descending branch mean was adopted as the `` mean '' .",
    "we pay specific attention to this detail in our results and discussion section . finally , we look at @xmath0 colours whereas skm studied predominantly @xmath6 colours .",
    "the @xmath0 colour is a good indicator of temperature @xcite and is a crucial colour for the existing calibration of the extra - galactic distance scale ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    ccccccc m & @xmath15 & @xmath16 & @xmath17 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 & @xmath20 +   + 11.5 & 4.279 & 4830 & 43.3924 & 0.042 & 27.58 & -0.164 + 11.1 & 4.228 & 4900 & 37.8090 & 0.039 & 24.40 & -0.157 + 10.8 & 4.188 & 4950 & 34.4156 & 0.037 & 22.25 & -0.133 + 10.5 & 4.147 & 5000 & 30.8189 & 0.035 & 20.26 & -0.119 + 9.55 & 4.009 & 5075 & 23.4835 & 0.025 & 15.69 & -0.094 + 9.45 & 3.994 & 5265 & 20.0414 & 0.028 & 13.55 & -0.051 + 8.60 & 3.856 & 5300 & 15.8313 & 0.022 & 10.78 & -0.040 + 7.70 & 3.696 & 5332 & 12.1076 & 0.015 & 8.291 & -0.036 + 7.30 & 3.618 & 5440 & 10.0124 & 0.014 & 6.886 & -0.017 + 7.30 & 3.618 & 5490 & 9.69213 & 0.014 & 6.670 & -0.007 + 7.00 & 3.557 & 5490 & 8.83394 & 0.013 & 6.087 & -0.010 + 6.80 & 3.515 & 5485 & 8.31328 & 0.011 & 5.733 & -0.014 + 6.45 & 3.438 & 5545 & 7.12090 & 0.011 & 4.921 & -0.007 + 6.10 & 3.357 & 5580 & 6.16131 & 0.009 & 4.267 & -0.006 + 6.00 & 3.333 & 5590 & 5.59661 & 0.006 & 3.884 & -0.007 +   + 10.0 & 4.534 & 5150 & 66.9094 & 0.144 & 38.47 & -0.413 + 8.50 & 4.279 & 5100 & 44.8456 & 0.129 & 27.38 & -0.238 + 8.00 & 4.184 & 5090 & 38.5673 & 0.116 & 23.98 & -0.196 + 7.40 & 4.061 & 5050 & 32.4902 & 0.096 & 20.55 & -0.171 + 7.20 & 4.019 & 5250 & 26.1109 & 0.081 & 16.99 & -0.115 + 7.00 & 3.975 & 5400 & 21.8715 & 0.060 & 14.45 & -0.077 + 6.30 & 3.810 & 5390 & 16.9148 & 0.055 & 11.37 & -0.048 + 5.50 & 3.597 & 5350 & 12.4229 & 0.038 & 8.445 & -0.051 + 5.10 & 3.478 & 5396 & 10.0049 & 0.030 & 6.851 & -0.041 + 5.00 & 3.447 & 5420 & 9.37928 & 0.028 & 6.436 & -0.036 + 4.90 & 3.416 & 5440 & 8.80955 & 0.026 & 6.056 & -0.033 + 4.80 & 3.383 & 5470 & 8.21323 & 0.025 & 5.657 & -0.027 + 4.50 & 3.282 & 5460 & 7.06755 & 0.017 & 4.878 & -0.037 + 4.40 & 3.247 & 5490 & 6.56235 & 0.016 & 4.536 & -0.032 + 4.20 & 3.174 & 5560 & 5.60322 & 0.015 & 3.887 & -0.022 +   + 4.57 & 3.306 & 5707 & 10.5472 & 0.035 & 7.234 & -0.000 + 5.44 & 3.578 & 5550 & 6.25949 & 0.022 & 4.340 & 0.020 +    ccccc @xmath21 & @xmath22 & @xmath23 & @xmath24 & @xmath5 +   + 43.3924 & 23323.69 & 5301.44 & 15265.45 & 4653.25 + 37.8090 & 20547.96 & 5355.92 & 13844.78 & 4759.77 + 34.4156 & 18675.64 & 5399.02 & 12811.00 & 4681.60 + 30.8189 & 17046.03 & 5446.49 & 11592.02 & 4719.65 + 23.4835 & 12259.96 & 5456.64 & 8535.450 & 4820.82 + 20.0414 & 12503.63 & 5720.76 & 7897.603 & 4948.82 + 15.8313 & 8828.696 & 5664.44 & 6018.911 & 5025.59 + 12.1076 & 5616.756 & 5525.95 & 4402.925 & 5135.11 + 10.0124 & 4470.551 & 5531.94 & 3703.182 & 5274.68 + 9.69213 & 4484.612 & 5585.30 & 3647.089 & 5303.57 + 8.83394 & 3872.188 & 5619.60 & 3172.488 & 5312.02 + 8.31328 & 3501.343 & 5612.30 & 2906.126 & 5322.39 + 7.12090 & 2954.314 & 5673.40 & 2436.595 & 5396.37 + 6.16131 & 2434.291 & 5700.83 & 2059.419 & 5459.73 + 5.59661 & 2260.885 & 5691.47 & 2023.329 & 5513.33 +   + 66.9094 & 39933.45 & 5468.07 & 25451.85 & 4807.32 + 44.8456 & 24179.71 & 5738.10 & 12478.80 & 4707.13 + 38.5673 & 19927.26 & 5762.38 & 9964.144 & 4696.57 + 32.4902 & 15175.07 & 5724.16 & 7818.562 & 4720.46 + 26.1109 & 13968.71 & 5886.81 & 7294.068 & 4949.57 + 21.8715 & 13020.35 & 6056.17 & 7076.027 & 5176.93 + 16.9148 & 8608.982 & 5999.40 & 4782.056 & 4961.41 + 12.4229 & 5070.216 & 5846.81 & 3081.266 & 4998.02 + 10.0049 & 3724.848 & 5785.06 & 2465.684 & 5074.73 + 9.37928 & 3427.493 & 5770.41 & 2320.390 & 5115.94 + 8.80955 & 3130.614 & 5748.80 & 2187.659 & 5156.00 + 8.21323 & 2843.303 & 5729.82 & 2062.474 & 5217.61 + 7.06755 & 2080.732 & 5572.38 & 1722.053 & 5295.72 + 6.56235 & 1885.999 & 5565.48 & 1587.056 & 5332.63 + 5.60322 & 1580.301 & 5697.21 & 1315.624 &",

    "are connected by an adopted ml relation , hence it is only necessary to choose the mass and the effective temperature for computing a cepheid model . in this study , we used two ml relations , which are calculated from evolutionary models appropriate for intermediate - mass stars :    1 .   the ml relation given by @xcite , which was also used by @xcite in their theoretical study of long period cepheids : @xmath27 2 .   the ml relations given by @xcite : @xmath28    the units for both @xmath29 and @xmath30 are in solar unit .",

    "after a linear non - adiabatic analysis @xcite which yields the normal mode spectrum , an initial perturbation , which is scaled to match the fundamental mode linear velocity eigenvector , is applied and the model followed until a stable limit cycle is reached . in some cases , this means following the pulsations for about 1000 cycles .",
    "this results in a full amplitude cepheid oscillating in the fundamental mode .",
    "following skm , we can compute the temperature at an optical depth @xmath33 and also the temperature and opacity profiles as a function of depth at various phases of the pulsation .",

    "figure [ fig7 ] illustrates the luminosity and temperature profiles against mass distribution in one pulsating cycle .",
    "in general , the hif sweeps back and forth in the mass distribution as the star pulsates . a naive way of thinking about this would be that the hif is furthest out and furthest in , in the mass distribution , at maximum and minimum light respectively ( skm ) .",
    "our models indicate that the situation is more complicated than this , and we summarize the main results from figure [ fig4]-[fig6 ] as follow :    1 .   at minimum light ,",
    "the photosphere is closest to the hif at short period but moves progressively away from the base of the hif as the model period increases .",
    "this is in concordance with the lowest panel of figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] which display the period temperature relation for models and data as one single line such that longer period models have cooler photospheric temperatures at minimum light .",
    "however , at maximum light , the photosphere lies at the base of the of the hif for all the models presented .",
    "2 .   we can quantify this by defining the quantity @xmath55 to be the `` distance '' , in units of @xmath56 , between the photosphere and the point in the hif where @xmath57 is a maximum .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] illustrates this and figure [ fig9 ] portrays the results when we plot @xmath55 against @xmath38 at maximum , minimum and the ascending and descending branch means . in figure [ fig9 ] , the error bars are estimated from the coarseness of the grid points around the location of hif .",
    "we see clearly that at maximum light , @xmath55 is constant over a large period range , whereas at minimum light , @xmath55 gets larger as the period increases .",
    "the value of @xmath55 at the phases of ascending and descending branch means is a mixture of the behavior at maximum and minimum light .",
    "there is an indication that for long period models ( @xmath58 ) at maximum light , the photosphere starts to become disengaged from the base of the hif .",
    "as the period increases , so does the @xmath31 ratio and , in general , the effective temperatures become lower .",
    "kanbur ( 1995 ) showed that such changes push the hif further inside the mass distribution , making it harder to interact with the photosphere even at maximum light when it is closer to the surface .",
    "this can cause a non - zero slope in the @xmath38-@xmath59 plane at long periods .",
    "this was also noted by skm .",
    "the hif at mean light is not always between its locations at maximum or mean light .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] illustrates our point and shows various locations on the ascending and descending branch of a typical light curve from our models .",
    "the lower two panels show the temperature profile at each of these phases .",
    "we see that the hif at phase @xmath60 is actually further out in the mass distribution than at maximum light and conversely the hif is further in in the mass distribution at the phase corresponding to mean light on the descending branch than at minimum light",
    ". moreover , the nature and shape of the hif seems to change significantly during the pulsation period .",
    "4 .   at short / long period , the hif at ascending / descending branch mean",
    "light is located in front / behind its location at maximum / minimum light .",
    "we also note that the nature of the hif changes when it is located outside of its locations at either maximum or minimum light .",
    "these changes in the hif occur at period ranges corresponding to the location of bumps on the ascending or descending branches of the light curve : the hertzsprung progression .",
    "if we define `` amplitude of hif oscillation '' as the range of @xmath61 values occupied by the hif , then there is a correlation between this and the resulting amplitude of the photospheric light curve .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] and the results of tables [ tab4 ] & [ tab5 ] suggest that cepheids with @xmath62 do not obey a flat relation with period at maximum light .",
    "our current grid of models does not include any models with such periods , but figures [ fig9 ] does indicate that the photosphere will be located at the base of the hif at all phases of pulsation as is the case with rrab stars @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig9 ] also indicates that as the period gets shorter the `` distance '' in the mass distribution between the hif and the photosphere is the same at maximum and minimum light .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that there will be a flat pc relation at both these phases as explained by @xcite and @xcite for the case of rrab stars .",
    "these short period , fundamental mode cepheids will be investigated in a future paper .",
    "it is desirable to compare the theoretical light curves from models _ quantitatively _ to the observed light curves , for example by fourier decomposition @xcite or principal component analysis @xcite .",
    "the three panels of figure [ fig10 ] present the plots of the fourier amplitudes @xmath63 & @xmath64 ( top and bottom left - side panels respectively ) and @xmath65 ( right - side panel ) against @xmath47 for the observed data and the model light curves .",

    "we used a simulated annealing technique to perform this fourier decomposition .",
    "this method significantly reduces numerical noise in the fourier decomposition of sparsely sampled periodic data @xcite .    in terms of these diagrams",
    ", there is much better agreement between models and observations when we use the chiosi ml relation ( equation [ 2 ] ) .",
    "these diagrams also illustrate that the agreement between models and data in the @xmath38-temperature or @xmath38-colour plane is a necessary , but not sufficient , condition for agreement between observed and theoretical light curves .",
    "this also emphasizes that the physical effect of interest in this paper - the interaction of the photosphere and hif - is a fundamental physical effect which is , to some extent , independent of the ml relation used .",
    "the florida code used in this study contains a recipe to calculate the time dependent turbulent convection whilst skm found a similar result using a purely radiative , dynamically zoned code .",
    "our results imply that this interaction is also independent of numerical techniques and physics included in the code .",
    "what is needed is the presence of hydrogen and an accurate description of the opacity when hydrogen starts to ionize .    at first sight",
    ", the left panels of figure [ fig10 ] might lead one to question the ml relation in equation ( 3 ) .",
    "however , the numerical recipe to model convection contains seven dimensionless parameters ( the @xmath68 parameters , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , many of which can influence the amplitude . a more detailed study and comparison of the effect of ml relations",
    "may remove this discrepancy .",
    "for example , the two models constructed with the ml relation used in skm , shown as black dots in figure [ fig10 ] , do lie closer to the observations in the fourier plane .",
    "this may also explain the discrepancy between observations and theory in the @xmath38-@xmath69 plane for @xmath58 when the @xcite ml relation is used .",
    "by looking at the way the cepheid photosphere , the region where the cepheid continuum is generated , interacts with the hif , we have provided a simple qualitative physical explanation for the observed pc properties of fundamental mode galactic cepheids with @xmath70 .",
    "this explanation relies on the fact that the opacity in a cepheid becomes very high when hydrogen starts to ionize .",
    "this acts as a wall and prevents the photosphere going any deeper , and leads to a flat relation between period and temperature at the phase when the hif interacts with the photosphere . for galactic cepheids this",
    "is observed at maximum light . at other phases ,",
    "the photosphere is located away from the opacity wall and its temperature is related to the global properties of the star and hence its period .",
    "this explains , convincingly , why the galactic cepheid period - temperature relation is flat at maximum light and has a non - zero , single slope at mean and minimum light .",
    "the qualitative nature of this idea remains true whether the pulsation code is purely radiative ( as in skm ) , or has a numerical recipe to model time dependent turbulent convection as in this work .",
    "the interaction between the photosphere and hif may also provide some explanation for the suggestion made by @xcite , that the region where spectral lines are formed do not necessary move homologously with the region where the k - band continuum is formed .",
    "in addition , because we have used two ml relations with a wide range of @xmath31 ratio in our study , and because the same physical effect is present in models constructed with either relation , the qualitative nature of our result is independent of the ml relation used .",
    "however , the ml relation used and its variation with metallicity , will dictate how the interaction of the hif with the photosphere changes with cepheids in a different metallicity environment . in the next paper in this series",
    ", we will investigate how these ideas can be used to explain the pc , ac and pl properties of fundamental mode lmc cepheids .",
    "we have also found evidence that the non - linear nature of the galactic pc relation at maximum light reported by kn is due to short period fundamental mode cepheids with @xmath62 .",
    "these short period stars follow distinctly different pc relations and deserve further detailed study .      what bearing do the results of this paper have on the cepheid pc and pl relations at mean light ?",
    "it is clear that pc relations at different phases contribute to the pc relation at mean light .",
    "if we choose @xmath71 as the extinction corrected colour at phase @xmath72 , then a pc relation at this phase is :    @xmath73    and taking the average over a pulsation period , @xmath74 , this becomes :    @xmath75    it is clear that the average intercept and slope will be affected by their values at individual phase points such as maximum or minimum light .",
    "@xcite compute pc relations for galactic and magellanic cloud cepheids at all phases between 0 and 1 and show that , for example for galactic cepheids , as the phase approaches maximum light , the slope of the pc relation becomes flatter . since the mean light pc relation affects the mean light pl relation @xcite",
    ", our aim of understanding the reasons behind changes in the pc and ac relations at different phases has a direct bearing on understanding at least one cause of the possible variation of the mean light cepheid pl relation from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "below we outline how our results are pertinent to studies of the variability of the cepheid pl relation from galaxy to galaxy , though we emphasize that much of this discussion is dependent on theoretical model and data analysis currently being undertaken .",
    "hence the following discussion is a road - map of some aspects of our future work .",
    "the evidence that shows the slope of the lmc pl relation at mean light is significantly different to the slope of the mean light pl relation in the galaxy has been provided in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the mean light lmc pl relation suffers a change at a period of 10 days whilst the mean light galactic pl relation data is consistent with a single slope with current data @xcite .    to understand the effect of the pc relation on the pl relation , consider the period - luminosity - color ( plc ) relation valid at any phase :",
    "@xmath76    if the pc relation is broken , say at a period @xmath17 , then we have :    @xmath77 @xmath78    substituting these two equations into the plc relation leads to two pl relations :    @xmath79 @xmath80    hence changes in the slope and intercept of the pc relation have a direct bearing on the slope and intercept of the pl relation .",
    "however , the results from this paper and also from kn and @xcite imply that the mean light pc relation is affected by changes in the pc relation at different phases during a pulsation cycle , as given in equation ( 5 ) .",
    "thus the study of pc relations at various phases impacts on the variability of the mean light pl relation from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "in this paper , we have updated and extended the work of skm to provide an account of a simple physical mechanism , the interaction of the photosphere and hif , which can change the properties of pc relations for galactic cepheids and so affect the pl relation .",
    "specifically , a new result of our work is that for galactic cepheids with @xmath70 , the maximum light pc relation is flat , i.e. , the hif and photosphere are engaged at maximum light .",
    "we also study the changes in ac relations because they are linked to pc relations through equation ( 1 ) . a flat pc relation at maximum light leads to an ac relation at minimum light of slope @xmath81 from equation ( 1 ) , as seen in figure [ fig3 ] and table [ tab5 ] .",
    "however , a cepheid in the lmc will have a different ml relation , usually in the sense that lmc ml relations have higher @xmath31 ratios . then in order to compare galactic and lmc cepheids of the same period , the lmc cepheid needs to be hotter ( kn ) . @xcite and @xcite found that such changes in the @xmath82 triplet describing the model changes the relative location of the hif and hence the phase and the range of periods at which they interact .",
    "our hypothesis is that for lmc models , it is only after @xmath8 that the hif and photosphere are engaged at phases around maximum light , leading to a flat pc relation .",
    "this flat pc relation for long period ( @xmath8 ) lmc cepheids is one cause for the non - linear nature of the mean light lmc pl relation ( kn ) .",
    "empirically , @xcite provide preliminary evidence that the lmc pc relation is flat only for @xmath8 whereas this crossover period is @xmath50 in the case of the galaxy . in case of smc cepheids , kn also provide evidence that the maximum light pc relation is not flat even for long period cepheids .",
    "our contention is , using some of the results of this paper , that amplitudes in smc cepheids are not high enough to force an interaction between the photosphere and hif , as the smc cepheids have lower amplitudes than the lmc @xcite .",
    "this again must wait confirmation from a new set of smc models .",
    "the final effect on pl relations at mean light will depend on the behavior at other phases , such as minimum light .",
    "for example , preliminary calculations to be presented in a future paper imply that certain changes seen in the pc relation at minimum light ( kn ) may correspond to the first overtone mode becoming stable . not surprisingly , a thorough quantitative study of this must await the analysis of lmc and smc cepheid models , which are currently under construction .",
    "the details of the influence of flat / non - flat pc relations on the mean pc and pl relations , the crossover period of @xmath17 that could vary from galaxy to galaxy , and the comparison of pl relations at maximum and minimum light for different galaxies are beyond the scope of this paper , and will be presented in the future papers .",
    "@xcite recently reported a metallicity dependence in the zero point of cepheid pl relation at mean light .",
    "they used 34 galactic cepheids with individual metallicity measurements and then supplemented this sample with primarily long period magellanic cloud cepheids to show the existence of a quadratic term in @xmath38 in the pl relation .",
    "when they used primarily galactic cepheids in their sample , they found no evidence of a quadratic term .",
    "they interpreted these results as being due to a metallicity dependent zero point in the pl relation .",
    "these results are also consistent with the cepheid lmc pl relation having different slopes for long and short period cepheids as suggested by kn and @xcite .",
    "@xcite also plotted amplitude - mean colour relations in luminosity bins .",
    "however , kn s ac relations were along the instability strip . it will be interesting to apply the precepts behind equation ( 1 ) and multi - phase ac relations in luminosity and/or period bins , that is , across the instability strip .",

    "<S> in this paper , we construct full amplitude non - linear hydrodynamical models of fundamental mode galactic cepheids and analyze the resulting theoretical period - colour and amplitude - colour relations at maximum , mean and minimum light . </S>",
    "<S> these theoretical relations match the general form of the observed relations well . </S>",
    "<S> this agreement is , to some extent , independent of the mass - luminosity relations used , pulsation code , numerical techniques , details of the input physics and methods to convert theoretical quantities , such as bolometric luminosity and temperature , to observational quantities , such as v band magnitudes or @xmath0 colours . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the period - colour and amplitude - colour properties of fundamental mode galactic cepheids with periods such that @xmath1 can be explained by a simple application of the stefan - boltzmann law and the interaction of the photosphere with the hydrogen ionization front . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of our results for explaining the behavior of galactic cepheid period - colour , and period - luminosity relations at mean light .    </S>",
