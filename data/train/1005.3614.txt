    "the problem of quantum state transfer along the spin chain @xcite acquires significance in the study of quantum communication systems .",
    "several models of the end - to - end quantum state transfer along the spin-1/2 chain were suggested @xcite .",
    "all these models are based on using either inhomogeneous chains with different coupling constants between nearest neighbors ( nn ) or homogeneous chains with different larmor frequencies on the chain nodes .",
    "seminal works @xcite use nn interactions in the inhomogeneous symmetrical chain .",
    "all coupling constants of such chains have fixed values , allowing one to transfer the state during the time interval independent of the length of the chain . the method proposed in refs.@xcite and developed in refs.@xcite",
    "is based on the week end bonds in the chain when interactions of all remote spins are taken into account ( the week end bonds method ( webm ) ) .",
    "transfer time increases with the length of the chain in this case .",
    "since it is very difficult to construct inhomogeneous chains , an alternative method of state transfer along the spin chain has been proposed recently @xcite .",
    "the effect of the high probability state transfer ( hpst ) along the homogeneous spin-1/2 chain is achieved here because of the specially tailored external inhomogeneous magnetic field . in the simplest case",
    "one needs only two nonzero end larmor frequencies and zero inner ones ( end larmor frequencies method ( elfm ) ) .",
    "the problem of quantum state transfer requires solving some physical questions .",
    "in particular , it is not clear whether the presence of inner nodes ( so - called `` body '' of the chain ) improves parameters of state transfer ( transfer time and probability ) .",
    "how will the transfer time be changed if we fix end nodes and remove the body ?",
    "even this very simple question requires a special study and will be considered for two methods of state transfer ( webm and elfm ) applied to the spin-1/2 chain governed by either an xy or xxz hamiltonian with dipole - dipole interactions .    in this article",
    ", we develop an approach to the exact diagonalization of the xy - hamiltonian with nn interactions for the combination of webm and elfm , fig.[fig : methods ] .",
    "we show also the formal equivalence of the spin dynamics governed by the xy and xxz hamiltonians in the specially tailored inhomogeneous external magnetic field in the problem of quantum state transfer with a single excited spin .",
    "we perform the numerical simulations of quantum state transfer along the ten - node chain with dipole - dipole interactions governed by different hamiltonians ( xy or xxz ) using different methods of state transfer ( webm or elfm ) and different types of interactions ( nn or all node interactions ) .",
    "we concentrate on the following problems in numerical simulations :    1 .",
    "study the influence of the inner nodes on the transfer time over the given distance @xmath0 .",
    "we will show that inner nodes may either descrease or increase the transfer time in dependence on the hamiltonian , the method of the state transfer and the type of interactions .",
    "compare the end - to - end transfer times along the chains governed by different hamiltonians with different methods of the state transfer and different types of interactions .",
    "thus , the structure of this paper is following .",
    "we give some details regarding the spin dynamics in sec.[section : general ] .",
    "the analytical description of the spin dynamics along the chain governed by the xy hamiltonian with nn interactions using the combination of webm and elfm is given in sec .",
    "[ section : analitical ] .",
    "the numerical simulations of the quantum state transfer corresponding to different hamiltonians , methods of the state transfer and types of interactions are represented in sec.[section : numerics ] .",
    "we briefly summarize our results in the concluding section , sec.[section : conclusions ] .",
    "consider the spin dynamics along the spin-1/2 chains governed by either xy or xxz hamiltonian in the inhomogeneous external magnetic field .",
    "these hamiltonians read : @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the coupling constant between the @xmath3th and the @xmath4th nodes .",
    "hereafter we will study the one - dimensional spin-1/2 chains and use the dimensionless time @xmath5 , distances @xmath6 , coupling constants @xmath7 and larmor frequencies @xmath8 , defined as follows : @xmath9 using definitions ( [ tau ] ) , the hamiltonians ( [ hamiltonianxy ] ) and ( [ hamiltonianxxz ] ) may be written as follows : @xmath10    in order to characterize the effectiveness of the quantum state transfer from the first to the @xmath11th node , the fidelity @xmath12 has been introduced @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a transfer amplitude : @xmath15 here @xmath16 , @xmath17 , are components of the normalized eigenvector @xmath18 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath19 of the matrix @xmath20 , @xmath21 : @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the matrix representation of @xmath24 .",
    "it is simple to show the equivalence of the single excited spin dynamics governed by the xy and xxz hamiltonians .",
    "in fact , two hamiltonians ( [ hamiltonianxydimles ] ) and ( [ hamiltonianxxzdimles ] ) differ by the diagonal parts , i.e. @xmath25 since we consider the single excited state transfer and both hamiltonians commutes with @xmath26 ( @xmath27 projection of the total spin ) , the spin dynamics is described by only one block of the hamiltonian which may be written on the basis of @xmath11 eigenvectors @xmath28 , @xmath29 , where notation @xmath28 means that the @xmath30th node is excited , i.e. directed opposite to the external magnetic field",
    ". then the matrix representation @xmath31 of @xmath32 reads @xcite as follows : @xmath33    thus both hamiltonians are equal to each other if @xmath34 . since the number of the diagonal elements in @xmath31 coincides with the number of larmor frequencies in each hamiltonian , this condition may be satisfied by the proper choice of the larmor frequencies in either the xy or xxz hamiltonian .",
    "this conclusion remains correct for an arbitrary spin-1/2 system .",
    "nevertheless , we consider xy and xxz hamiltonians independently as far as there is no a simple method of generation of the inhomogeneous magnetic field",
    ".    remember that @xmath35 may be put to zero by the proper choice of the constant homogeneous magnetic field @xcite .",
    "for this reason , hereafter we consider the probability of the state transfer , @xmath36 , instead of the fidelity as a characteristic of the state transfer effectiveness .",
    "in this section , we develop the ideas of ref.@xcite and give an analytical description of the single excited spin dynamics in the chain governed by the xy hamiltonian with nn interactions combining both webm and elfm . in other words , one has to substitute @xmath38 into the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonianxydimles ] ) , which reads : @xmath39 since we are interested in the single excited spin dynamics , the hamiltonian has @xmath40 matrix representation ( see sec.[section : general ] ) ) , which reads ( up to the scalar term , which is not important in our case and may be removed by adding a proper homogeneous constant external magnetic field ) : @xmath41 first , one has to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath20 . for this purpose",
    ", we solve the equation @xmath42 for the components of the eigenvectors @xmath18 , where @xmath19 are the solutions to the characteristic equation @xmath43 and @xmath44 is an @xmath40 unit matrix .",
    "the system ( [ du ] ) may be written as follows : @xmath45 eqs.([duk ] ) are known to have the following solution @xmath46 then eq.([char ] ) becomes equivalent to the compatibility condition of the system of four equations , eqs .",
    "( [ du1],[du2],[dun-1],[dun ] ) for any @xmath4 .",
    "after some transformations , this compatibility condition reads @xmath47 one can show that this equation can be treated as the @xmath11 degree polynomial equation for the variable @xmath48 , and consequently , it has @xmath11 roots .",
    "all roots can be separated into two sets of @xmath49 and @xmath50 roots , which are solutions to one of two following equations : @xmath51\\\\ \\nonumber & &   \\delta ( 2\\omega-2\\delta \\cos p_j)\\sin{\\frac{n-1}{2}p_j}+ \\sin{\\frac{n-3}{2}p_j }   = 0,\\;\\;j = n_1 + 1,\\dots , n.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath52 $ ] means the integer part of @xmath53 .",
    "thus , using eqs.([conditions_p ] ) , expressions for the normalized eigenvector components can be written as follows : @xmath54 where @xmath55 then the probability of the end - to - end excited state transfer reads : @xmath56 which will be used in those examples of sec.[section : numerics ] where nn interactions are considered .",
    "the derived formulas become most simple in the case @xmath57 .",
    "the eigenvalues ( [ lambda ] ) have the following explicit forms : @xmath58 formula ( [ p ] ) reduces to the following one : @xmath59 where @xmath60 let us demonstrate that the perfect state transfer is possible at some time moment @xmath61 if the parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 have been properly chosen .",
    "first , we remark that perfect state transfer is achieved if @xmath64 ) and ( [ maximum2 ] ) are equivalent to the following pair of complete systems of algebraic equations ( remember that @xmath61 , @xmath63 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 must be positive , while @xmath62 must be real ) : @xmath67 if @xmath68 ( webm ) , then we obtain alternating spin chain of four nodes . in this case , @xmath69 so that system ( [ maximum_1 ] ) becomes inconsistent , while system ( [ maximum_2 ] ) acquires the following form : @xmath70 which agrees with the results obtained for the alternating spin-1/2 chain of four nodes @xcite .",
    "the relation between @xmath71 and @xmath72 in eq.([maximum_22 ] ) is a consequence of the inequality @xmath73 .",
    "now we represent results of the numerical simulations of the end - to - end single excited state transfer along the spin-1/2 chain of ten nodes . considering the problem of state transfer between two end nodes separated by the dimensionless distance @xmath74 ,",
    "first , we recall the simplest model of two spins with the distance @xmath0 between them ( sec.[section : n2 ] ) .",
    "next , in sec.[section : n10 ] , we find end - to - end transfer times over the same distance @xmath0 along the ten - node chain using both xy and xxz hamiltonians , with both webm and elfm using both nn and all node interactions .",
    "in particular , we study the problem whether the presence of inner nodes reduces the time interval required for state transfer over the distance @xmath0 in comparison with the above simplest system of two interacting spins .",
    "it will be shown that the answer is not always positive .",
    "note that we solve the optimization problem for the case of all node interactions ( i.e. , we find such parameters of the spin chain which provide the end - to - end hpst during as short as possible a time interval ) .",
    "then , we consider the spin dynamics using nn interactions and keeping the same parameters of the spin chain .",
    "this allows us to see whether nn interactions give different transfer times in comparison with the case of all node interactions .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the quantum state can be perfectly transferred between two spin-1/2 nodes separated by the distance @xmath74 during the dimensionless time interval @xmath75 such that ( see eq.([tau ] ) ) @xmath76 however the time interval @xmath77 increases with an increase in @xmath0 so that the direct node - to - node quantum state transfer over the long distance @xmath0 becomes impossible because of the quantum decoherence .",
    "it is assumed that the set of inner nodes placed between the above two nodes may help one to overcome the problem of decoherence .",
    "however , it seemed that these nodes were not always helpful .",
    "we will use the dimensionless time interval @xmath78 as a characteristics of the @xmath11-node chain .",
    "we say that the inner nodes in the @xmath11-node chain are usefull if the end - to - end transfer time along this chain is less than @xmath75 .",
    "it is remarkable that the parameter @xmath78 depends only on @xmath0 and does not depend on the hamiltonians and methods of state transfer .",
    "in fact , the xy hamiltonian coincides with the xxz hamiltonian up to the scalar term in the matrix representation ( see eq.([deltaham_matr ] ) with @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) as far as the problem of the single quantum state transfer along the two - node chain is considered .",
    "this term does not effect on the probability of state transfer .",
    "we represent results of the numerical simulations of the end - to - end state transfer along the ten - node chain using both webm and elfm .",
    "considering webm , we will use parameter @xmath63 introduced in eq.([delta ] ) and zero larmor frequencies .",
    "choosing the value of @xmath63 , we follow the ideology of ref.@xcite , where the distance between the end nodes and the body of the chain is twice as long as the distance between neighbors in the body .",
    "thus we take @xmath82 , see fig.[fig : methods]a with @xmath83 .",
    "however , we have observed that all conclusions remain valid for different values of @xmath63 as well .",
    "considering elfm , we take @xmath84 and nonzero end larmor frequencies @xmath62 , while all inner larmor frequencies are zeros , see fig.[fig : methods]b with @xmath83 and @xmath85",
    ".    results of our numerical simulations are represented in figs.[fig : n10xyall]-[fig : n10xxzallom ] , namely , the functions @xmath86 obtained using webm for the spin-1/2 chains governed by the xy and xxz hamiltonians are shown in figs.[fig : n10xyall ] and [ fig : n10xxzall ] respectively ; similarly , functions @xmath87 obtained using the elfm for the spin chains governed by the xy and xxz hamiltonians are shown in figs.[fig : n10xyallom ] and [ fig : n10xxzallom ] , respectively .",
    "dynamics with both all node interactions and nn interactions are represented therein .",
    "parameters @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , @xmath91 are the end - to - end transfer times and probabilities of these transfers in the case of all node interactions and nn interactions respectively . in the following ,",
    "we collect the results of analysis of all figures [ fig : n10xyall]-[fig : n10xxzallom ] .",
    "\\(i ) let @xmath92 and @xmath93 be the transfer times corresponding to webm and elfm respectively . comparing the transfer times shown in figs.[fig : n10xyall]-[fig : n10xxzallom ] with appropriate interval @xmath75",
    "we conclude that the inner nodes do not always reduce the transfer time in comparison with @xmath75 ( see table i ) .",
