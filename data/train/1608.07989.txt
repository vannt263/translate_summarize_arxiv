    "the internet of things ( iot ) is expected to connect billions of low - energy devices ( leds ) by 2020 @xcite .",
    "one of the main challenges of the iot is how to provide enough energy for the electronics of the leds , in order to have them operational over a reasonable amount of time without making their battery too large or the device itself too bulky . for several applications",
    ", it may not be even possible to ( re-)charge some leds .    in this context",
    ", the emerging concept of simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) may constitute a suitable solution for prolonging the battery life of leds and , in a foreseeable future , for making them energy - neutral , _",
    "i.e. _ , operational in a complete self - powered fashion .",
    "swipt , in particular , is a technology where the same radio frequency signal is used for information transmission and for replenishing the batteries of the leds @xcite .",
    "swipt may find application in the emerging market of cellular - enabled iot , where leds , _ e.g. _ , smart - watches @xcite , receive notifications from their own cellular connection @xcite and , simultaneously , re - charge their battery .",
    "the recent decision to standardize narrowband iot ( nb - iot ) , a new narrow - band radio technology that addresses the requirements of the iot , confirms the wish of capitalizing on the ubiquitous coverage offered by the cellular network infrastructure for iot applications @xcite .    in spite of these potential advantages ,",
    "the design and optimization of swipt - enabled cellular networks , which provide data connectivity and power to leds , pose new challenges and introduce never observed performance trade - offs .",
    "cellular networks are designed based on the assumption that the other - cell interference has a negative impact on wireless information transfer ( wit ) , since it reduces the coverage probability and average rate @xcite .",
    "interference , on the other hand , constitutes a natural source to be exploited for enabling wireless power transfer ( wpt ) @xcite . in swipt - enabled cellular networks , as a result , the development of interference management techniques that exploit interference for wpt and counteract it for wit plays a fundamental role , especially if the leds operate in scenarios with adverse networking conditions .    the application of smart antenna technologies , _",
    "i.e. _ , multiple - input - multiple - output ( mimo ) transmission and reception schemes , constitutes a promising solution for managing and exploiting the interference in swipt - enabled cellular networks @xcite .",
    "more specifically , mimo schemes can be exploited to provide two distinct benefits . on the one hand ,",
    "multiple antennas at the receiver can be used for increasing the amount of harvested power via spatial diversity . on the other hand ,",
    "multiple antennas at the transmitter can be used for improving the efficiency of information and energy transfer via spatial beamforming .",
    "a summary of recent results on the application of smart antenna technologies to swipt - enabled systems is available in @xcite .",
    "most of the existing works , however , are applicable to small - scale network topologies .",
    "large - scale networks are , on the other hand , much less investigated . in @xcite and @xcite , relay - aided networks are studied . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "ad hoc networks are analyzed .",
    "these papers , however , consider single - antenna transmission . in @xcite ,",
    "ad hoc networks with multiple - antenna transmitters are studied .",
    "the analysis , however , is not directly applicable to cellular networks , since the spatial constraints imposed by the cell association are not taken into account",
    ". the only paper where the performance of swipt - enabled cellular networks is investigated is @xcite , which , however , does not consider mimo either at the base stations ( bss ) or at the leds .    in this paper , motivated by these considerations , we introduce a tractable mathematical approach for quantifying the benefits , in terms of information rate and harvested power , of using mimo in swipt - enabled cellular networks .",
    "in particular , maximum ratio transmission ( mrt ) and maximum ratio combining ( mrc ) at the bss and at the leds are considered , respectively .",
    "the proposed approach relies on modeling the locations of the bss are points of a poisson point process ( ppp ) and uses stochastic geometry for system - level analysis .",
    "it accounts for the spatial correlation of the other - cell interference that emerges from swipt operation and is applicable to bss and leds equipped with an arbitrary number of transmit and receive antennas , respectively . with the use of mimo , it is proved that information rate and harvested power can be improved simultaneously .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ systemmodel ] ,",
    "the system model is introduced . in section [ mimo ] , mrt and mrc schemes",
    "are described . in section [ jccdf ] ,",
    "the trade - off between information rate and harvested power is quantified in terms of their joint complementary cumulative distribution function ( j - ccdf ) . in section [ results ] ,",
    "analysis and findings are validated with the aid of numerical simulations .",
