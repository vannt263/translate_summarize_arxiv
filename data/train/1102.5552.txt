    "the @xmath1-systems @xcite satisfied by the transfer matrices of the generalized heisenberg model or the @xmath4-characters of quantum affine algebras @xcite can be considered as discrete dynamical systems with special initial conditions .",

    "mutations are defined in such a way that the following laurent property is guaranteed : any cluster data may be expressed as a laurent polynomial of the cluster variables at any node of the tree .",
    "it was conjectured in @xcite and proved in several particular cases ( in particular in the so - called acyclic cases @xcite , or that of clusters arising from surfaces @xcite ) that these polynomials always have non - negative integer coefficients ( laurent positivity ) , a property that still awaits a good general combinatorial interpretation .",
    "cluster algebras turn out to be quite universal , and have found applications in various fields , such as the study of non - linear recursions , the geometry of teichmller space , quiver representations , wall crossing formulas etc .",
    "the relation between the recursion satisfied by the ( @xmath4- ) characters of kr - modules of quantum affine algebras on the one hand , and cluster algebras on the other , was found in @xcite .",
    "such systems are known as @xmath2-sytems or @xmath1-systems when they are supplemented by special boundary conditions .",
    "it is known that such equations can be interpreted as discrete integrable systems : in the case of an @xmath5 type algebra , the @xmath1-system was identified as the discrete hirota equation @xcite .",

    "thus the expression of the solutions as partition functions for positively weighted paths implies the laurent positivity for these particular clusters .    an important question is how to quantize such evolution equations @xcite .",

    "we then express the general solution in section [ section5 ] by use of a non - commutative transfer matrix , quantizing the solution of @xcite .",
    "the main result of the paper is theorem [ solq ] , which implies an interpretation of the solution as a partition function for  quantum paths \" with step weights which are non - commutative laurent monomials in the initial data , thereby proving laurent positivity for the relevant clusters .",
    "the @xmath7-periodic solutions of the @xmath1-systems satisfy @xmath2-system equations , and this generalizes to the quantum case .",

    "the solution was given in @xcite for this system using the method of @xcite .",
    "we revisit this system in section [ section6 ] and formulate a fully non - commutative ( as opposed to @xmath4-commutative ) version of the network transfer matrices used in section 4 to solve the @xmath1-system .",
    "this gives an alternative solution for the non - commutative @xmath0 @xmath2-system .",
    "finally in section [ conclusion ] we give the relation between the quantum @xmath0 @xmath1-system and the discrete quantum liouville equation of faddeev et al @xcite .",
