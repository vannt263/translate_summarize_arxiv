    "most studies of micro - instabilities consider those driven by gradients of density or ion and electron temperatures .",
    "however the toroidal current gradient is also a potential source of instability .",
    "indeed , this is the instability drive for tearing modes and it was even proposed @xcite that it could drive high mode number ideal mhd kink instability .",
    "this analysis was based on the periodic , cylindrical , ideal mhd equation for the perturbed magnetic flux function , @xmath4 $ ] , in the tokamak limit , @xmath5 : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the radial coordinate with @xmath8 denoting a radial derivative , @xmath9 the azimuthal angle and @xmath10 the axial co - ordinate , @xmath11 being the periodicity length in the @xmath10-direction , and we have introduced poloidal and toroidal mode numbers , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the magnetic field in the @xmath10-direction is @xmath14 , the safety factor @xmath15 and the normalised current density , @xmath16 , is defined by @xmath17    expanding the denominator of ( [ eq1 ] ) , @xmath18 , in the vicinity of the resonant position , @xmath19 , where , @xmath20 , so that @xmath21 with @xmath22 denoting a new ( dimensionless ) local radial variable , this equation takes the local form : @xmath23 where @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the magnetic shear at @xmath26 . equation  ( [ eq5 ] ) has been the basis for a number of studies at high @xmath12 .",
    "thus kadomtsev and pogutse  @xcite used it to claim that ideal mhd instability is possible , for steep current gradients or low shear , if @xmath27 while wesson  @xcite and strauss  @xcite investigated the dependence of the tearing mode index , @xmath0  @xcite on @xmath1 . hegna and",
    "callen  @xcite used a generalisation of ( [ eq5 ] ) that took account of the effect of toroidal and plasma shaping on metric coefficients , to estimate @xmath28 in more general , toroidal , devices .",
    "furthermore , the local gyrokinetic code gs2 has recently  @xcite been used to study current gradient driven instabilities in collisionless plasmas , again finding instability above a critical value of @xmath1 .",
    "however this code is based on the ballooning transformation and this also relies on a linear expansion of @xmath29 about the rational surface .",
    "unfortunately such treatments are not entirely consistent because , for @xmath30 , the truncated expansion of @xmath31 employed is inadequate .",
    "to see this is the case recall @xmath32 and @xmath33 are related through amp@xmath34re s equation , @xmath35 which can be written @xmath36 , so that @xmath37 with @xmath38 denoting the quantity @xmath39 . now if we restrict attention to positive values of the current density , @xmath32 , then @xmath40 and @xmath41",

    "we conclude that both ( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) must give a flawed description of stability of monotonic @xmath33 profiles .",
    "clearly , higher order terms in the expansion of @xmath48 are required .",
    "thus , remarkably , there is no truly local theory for such high-@xmath12 instabilities .",
    "we note that a comparison of analytic resistive tearing mode growth rates with those obtained from a numerical code at low@xmath49 also required the inclusion of more derivatives of @xmath33 to obtain agreement when the resistivity and @xmath0 were relatively high @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we reconsider the solution of ( [ eq1 ] ) at high @xmath12 , taking full account of the structure of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "two scenarios are studied : ( i ) a monotonic @xmath32 with a steep gradient , modelled by a `` tanh function '' ; and ( ii ) the effect of a positive current `` spike '' , possibly arising in the pedestal region of a tokamak in h - mode due to bootstrap currents .",
    "this latter case can lead to a region of greatly reduced shear , or even non - monotonic @xmath33 and multiple resonances .",
    "the outcomes of our calculations are self - consistent forms for @xmath0 which can be used to investigate high-@xmath12 tearing mode instability .",
    "a value of @xmath0 that accounts for key nonlocal features of the global structure of the self - consistent @xmath29 and current profiles is required to properly interpret the gs2 results alluded to above .",
    "the quantity @xmath0 also plays a role in determining the saturated amplitude of magnetic islands arising from tearing mode instability .",
    "however other parameters may play a role in determining this amplitude @xcite .",
    "in this section we consider a specific example for the current density @xmath32 which has a steep gradient , and exploit the property @xmath50 to expand ( [ eq1 ] ) close to the resonant surface at @xmath19 .",

    "a more careful inspection of the derivation of ( [ eq21 ] ) reveals that , at large negative values of @xmath109 the shear , @xmath110 , becomes exponentially small , @xmath111 , so that terms of order @xmath112 , which have been neglected , can compete , leading to the behaviour seen in figure  [ fig5 ] , for large , but finite , @xmath12 .",
    "not surprisingly , the @xmath28 values obtained , and therefore stability , are sensitive to the global structure of the ideal mhd region since equation ( [ eq21 ] ) contains less global information than equation ( [ eq11 ] ) , thereby resulting in the @xmath100 differences shown in figures  [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] .",
    "for comparison with the previous results of kadomtsev and pogutse @xcite and wesson @xcite , we have also calculated the tearing stability index @xmath113 obtained by computing solutions of ( [ eq5 ] ) with @xmath114 .     with figure  [ fig3 ] .",

    "@xmath116 is negative and changes sign at @xmath122 , as reported in @xcite .",
    "in this section we investigate a different , but possibly important , scenario in which a fairly localised positive current spike occurs relatively near the plasma edge @xcite , where resistivity is high and the inductive current density is small .",
    "the non - linear theory of external kink modes in the presence of such a current spike has been studied by eriksson and wahlberg @xcite .",
    "bootstrap currents in the region of a steep pedestal , or localized current drive , may produce just such a situation .",

    "surprisingly , however , this is not the case , as can be seen from figure  [ fig8 ] which displays the value of @xmath133 for an @xmath134 mode , calculated from ( [ eq1 ] ) , as @xmath19 is moved across the @xmath32 profile , regarding @xmath13 as a continuous variable .     for an @xmath134 mode , from solution of ( [ eq1 ] ) with @xmath32 given by ( [ eq23 ] ) .",

    "however , values of @xmath19 quite close to the maximum of the current spike are very unstable .",
    "to model this in a high-@xmath12 , localised analysis , we expand @xmath32 and @xmath33 locally around the maximum of the current density , approximately at @xmath137 , the maximum of the current spike . around this point , @xmath32 is dominated by the current spike , @xmath138 , and is a local function , @xmath139 , if we order the parameter @xmath140 .",
    "however , the @xmath29 profile in this region is determined by both the extended `` inductive '' current profile @xmath141 and by the current spike .",
    "it therefore contains both a slowly varying part , due to @xmath141 and a rapidly varying part , due to @xmath138 and the result can be a greatly reduced magnetic shear , as seen in figure  [ fig7 ] .",
    "the resulting local tearing equation has been derived in the appendix , for the current profile of ( [ eq23 ] ) .",
    "however a simpler derivation expands @xmath33 locally around the point , @xmath137 , at the maximum of @xmath32 , and orders the weakened shear , @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "thus : @xmath144 then , constructing @xmath145 from ( [ eq23 ] ) , the high-@xmath12 tearing mode equation , ( [ eq1 ] ) , can be written in the form ; @xmath146 where @xmath2 is again the location of the resonance .",
    "we note from ( [ eq24 ] ) that a monotonic @xmath29 profile requires @xmath147 .",
    "+ @xmath148as in section  [ sec3 ] , stability depends on two parameters , @xmath3 and @xmath2 . in order to reduce the parameter space in ( [ eq25 ] ) , we have focused on three cases : @xmath149 equation  ( [ eq25 ] ) has then been solved to obtain values of @xmath150 as the resonant location , @xmath2 , is moved across the local @xmath63 structure . results for cases ( a ) and ( b ) , equations  ( [ eq26 ] ) and ( [ eq27 ] ) respectively , are shown in figure  [ fig9 ] .",
    "the solid curve corresponds to case ( a ) and the dashed one to case ( b ) . in case ( c ) , ( [ eq28 ] ) , we exclude consideration of the region of triple resonance , i.e. @xmath151 and figure  [ fig10 ] shows the value of @xmath100 when @xmath2 falls outside this range . consideration of the triple resonances in case ( c ) raises issues involving the different characteristic frequencies associated with tearing at each of the three resonant surfaces , these frequencies being determined by diamagnetic terms and by sheared equilibrium rotation . in addition , case ( c ) is likely to arise only after an equilibrium current profile has evolved through the very unstable weak shear scenario , case ( b ) .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to note that as @xmath2 approaches the location of @xmath152 or @xmath153 , the value of @xmath100 becomes very large .    , from ( [ eq22 ] ) with @xmath154 ( solid curve ) and @xmath155 ( dashed curve ) , corresponding to monotonically increasing @xmath29 profiles.,width=302 ]     but with @xmath156 corresponding to reverse shear at @xmath157 , i.e to a locally non - monotonic @xmath29 profile .",

    "it is also of interest to note that hegna and callen  @xcite used a modification of ( [ eq5 ] ) to describe general geometry , and as a simple way to derive a convenient formula for @xmath0 in toroidal systems .",
    "although this may give a good approximation for values of @xmath227 , where @xmath0 is negative , it overestimates the instability drive for @xmath228 and predicts ideal instabilities for @xmath225 , where none exist .",
    "we have also investigated a situation with a non - monotonic profile of the current density , @xmath32 , as might result from bootstrap currents near a tokamak pedestal .",
    "stability of high-@xmath12 modes is again governed by a local equation , ( [ eq25 ] ) , depending on two parameters , @xmath3 and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a measure of the ratio @xmath229 and @xmath2 is the location of the resonance relative to the point of maximum @xmath230 . as for the previous case",
    ", ideal instability does not occur for any values of the @xmath3 and @xmath2 parameters , but positive values of the tearing index , @xmath0 can be found for sufficiently large values of @xmath3 .",
    "such values of @xmath3 can arise from the low shear resulting from the near cancellation of contributions from the background current and the current spike .",
    "these situations can , typically , lead to @xmath231 , implying @xmath232 .",
    "since such a current spike can result from the bootstrap current occurring naturally in the pedestal region of a tokamak h - mode plasma , these observations have possible relevance for the interpretation of elms in terms of surface `` peeling '' modes associated with tearing modes resonant within the pedestal .",
    "they also suggest the possibility of influencing elm behaviour by driving reverse currents within the pedestal region .",
    "we note that the potentially large values of @xmath0 could overcome stabilising effects , such as the glasser effect in a torus @xcite arising from a pressure gradient at the resonant surface in resistive mhd , or from diamagnetic effects associated with the steep gradients in the pedestal in hotter plasmas @xcite . to ameliorate the deleterious effects of large elms on divertor target plates , resonant magnetic perturbations ( rmps )",
    "have been applied to produce magnetic islands with the intention of driving pedestal gradients below the mhd stability limit .",
    "the tearing stability of the resulting non - symmetric equilibria is beyond the scope of this work but it is worth noting that the amplitude of such a rmp driven island depends on the value of @xmath0 calculated in this work @xcite .    at first sight , it is perhaps surprising that such high-@xmath12 calculations can not always be reduced to a purely local calculation involving only the current gradient and magnetic shear at the rational surface , but instead requires that the complete structure of the @xmath29 profile be taken into account , albeit in a narrow region for a sharply localised gradient in the current profile .",
    "consideration of this problem is beyond the scope of local gyro - kinetic codes .",
    "consequently the extension to a toroidal calculation must inevitably become two - dimensional , unlike problems amenable to the ballooning transformation as in , e.g. the local gyrokinetic code gs2 .",

    "in this appendix we demonstrate that , using the current distribution of ( [ eq23 ] ) with the parameter @xmath233 , the global kink / tearing equation , ( [ eq1 ] ) , can be reduced , in the limit of high-@xmath12 , to the form of ( [ eq25 ] ) , and that , for the case of the @xmath134 mode investigated in figure  [ fig8 ] , the equivalent @xmath3 value is @xmath234 .",
    "we first introduce the notation , @xmath235 and treat @xmath236 as @xmath237 parameter .",
    "then , in leading order of an expansion in @xmath112 , @xmath238 now with @xmath239 .",
    "we next construct an expression for @xmath240 appearing in the denominator of the current drive term of ( [ eq1 ] ) , noting that the contributions of the inductive current , @xmath141 , and the localised current spike , @xmath138 , are simply additive , so that : @xmath241 where @xmath242 . in equation  ( [ a3 ] ) we retained an @xmath243 correction because the leading order term is small at low shear due to near cancellation of the contributions from @xmath244 and @xmath245 to @xmath243 .",
    "finally , transforming the radial variable in ( [ eq1 ] ) to @xmath64 , the kink / tearing equation takes the form , @xmath246 }      \\right\\}=0 , \\label{a4}\\ ] ] which is precisely of the same form as ( [ eq25 ] ) when @xmath74 , with the parameter , @xmath3 given by : @xmath247 the above is easily generalised for non zero values of @xmath2 . note that the above mentioned cancellation of terms in @xmath244 and @xmath245 means that @xmath3 is formally @xmath237 but can become very large and even change sign if the shear at @xmath137 reverses .",
    "for the parameters of figure  [ fig7 ] , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath248 , and for @xmath134 , the equivalent value of @xmath3 is @xmath234 .",
