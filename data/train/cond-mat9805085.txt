    "in studies of disordered systems , one often encounters the problem of finding the density of single - particle states in energy regions where the states can only exist as a consequence of disorder .",
    "an example is the density of negative energy states of a particle moving in a random potential ( the lowest energy of a free particle is zero).@xcite another example is provided by a superconductor with magnetic impurities .",
    "the impurities break cooper pairs and fill the gap with electron states of arbitrarily small energy.@xcite the density of such states ( `` lifshitz tails '' ) is typically small , as it requires a large disorder fluctuation to induce them . in that case",
    "the density can be estimated by the probability of the least suppressed disorder fluctuation that creates a state of a given energy ( the so - called optimal fluctuation method).@xcite    in ref .",
    "we applied the optimal fluctuation method to study the density of states and optical absorption in disordered peierls insulators . in the absence of disorder ,",
    "the electron excitation spectrum in these quasi - one - dimensional materials has a gap which results from the electron - lattice instability and is accompanied by a periodic lattice distortion with the wave vector @xmath0.@xcite we considered half - filled chains , in which case the peierls instability results in an alternation of long and short bonds ( dimerization ) .",
    "disorder in the electron hopping amplitudes induces electron states inside the peierls gap , transforming it into a pseudogap . in ref .",
    "we showed that the optimal fluctuation for a disordered dimerized chain has the form of a soliton - antisoliton pair .",
    "it induces two electron states which lie close to the center of the pseudogap and which are symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions of states localized near the soliton and antisoliton . knowing the typical form of the disorder - induced electron states we were able to find the absorption coefficient at small energies .",
    "these results were also used to explain the coexistence of the dimerization and antiferromagnetism , observed recently in the spin - peierls material cugeo@xmath1.@xcite    the probability of the optimal configuration gives , however , only an estimate of the density of states .",
    "a more careful calculation requires finding the contribution of disorder realizations close to the optimal one . in this paper",
    ", we perform such a calculation using the close relation between the optimal fluctuation method and the semiclassical approximation in quantum mechanics and field theory . in the path integral version of this approximation ,",
    "the most important paths lie close to the `` saddle - points '' of the action , called instantons.@xcite in particular , the instantons for the double - well problem are the classical trajectories describing the imaginary time motion between the two wells , which corresponds to tunneling and results in level splitting .",
    "we show how the disorder average of the density of states can be written in the form of a functional integral that represents the sum over all paths of a particle in a corresponding double - well potential .",
    "then the optimal disorder configuration becomes precisely the instanton trajectory and the calculation of the density of states can be done using standard instanton methods .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ fgm ] we introduce the fluctuating gap model describing disordered peierls systems and briefly discuss the previously obtained analytical results for the disorder - averaged density of states in that model .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ funint ] we establish the relation between the disorder average in the fluctuating gap model and the quantum - mechanical average for a certain double - well problem .",
    "we find the instanton trajectory corresponding to the optimal fluctuation and perform the `` saddle - point '' integration for the average density of states .",
    "we discuss our results and conclude in sec .  [ discussion ] .",
    "two technical points are addressed in appendices . in appendix",
    "a we discuss how the symmetries of the fgm hamilitonian are crucial for the validity of the optimal fluctuation method . in appendix",
    "b we discuss the instanton calculation for a different choice of boundary conditions .",
    "the fluctuating gap model ( fgm ) is a continuum model describing electrons in disordered quasi - one - dimensional semiconductors.@xcite in this paper we use it to describe half - filled peierls chains with disorder in the hopping amplitudes of the electrons between the chain s lattice sites .",
    "these systems are characterized by the peierls order parameter , @xmath2 , which is the ( continuum version of the ) alternating part of the hopping amplitudes along the chain , _",
    "i.e. _ , the difference between the hopping amplitudes on nearest odd and even bonds . in the absence of disorder",
    "this order parameter ( also called `` dimerization '' ) is constant along the chain and equals the gap in the single - electron spectrum.@xcite disorder in the electron hopping amplitudes results in random variations of the order parameter along the chain ( which explains the name of the model ) : @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is the average value of the order parmeter and @xmath5 is the fluctuating part with a gaussian correlator , @xmath6    the single - electron states close to the fermi energy @xmath7 , are described by the wave function @xmath8 where the two amplitudes @xmath9 and @xmath10 correspond to electrons moving , respectively , to the right and to the left with the fermi velocity @xmath11 . since the density of single - electron states does not depend on spin projection , we omit the spin index of the electron wave function .",
    "the wave functions satisfy the one - dimensional dirac equation , @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 the pauli matrices . for the applicability of the continuum description of electrons , the random variations in the hopping amplitudes have to be relatively small .",

    "this is a dyson - type singularity,@xcite which occurs in the band center for random hamiltonians with charge conjugation symmetry .    in ref .",
    "we showed that the energy - dependence of the average density of states at small energy and weak disorder is mainly determined by the weight of the optimal disorder fluctuation @xmath38 , which is defined as the most probable among the fluctuations that induce a state at given energy @xmath34 .",

    "the small difference between the energies of the symmetric and antisymmetric states is potentially dangerous for the application of the optimal fluctuation method to the fgm .",
    "the problem arises in the calculation of the contribution of the disorder realizations close to the optimal fluctuation : @xmath60 the perturbation @xmath61 can , in principle , strongly mix the symmetric and antisymmetric intragap states , because of the small energy denominator @xmath62 appearing in the perturbation series .",
    "such mixing would affect the value of the energy splitting between the two states .",
    "this problem arises because of the charge conjugation symmetry of the dirac hamiltonian eq.([dirac ] ) , which implies the symmetry of the spectrum of its eigenvalues around @xmath37 .",
    "we address this question in appendix a , where we show that , just because of the symmetry of the hamiltonian eq.([dirac ] ) , the mixing of the symmetric and antisymmetric states is small and thus , despite the small energy splitting , the optimal fluctuation method is applicable .",
    "the result of appendix a also justifies our calculation of the optical absorption coefficient presented in ref .  .",
    "the weight of the optimal fluctuation , given by eq.([weight ] ) , is the main factor that describes the suppression of the density of states at small energy . to obtain a full expression for the density",
    ", however , one has to take into account the contribution of the disorder realizations close to the optimal configuration . in this section",
    "we perform this calculation using the correspondence between the averaging over disorder realizations @xmath5 and the quantum - mechanical averaging over the ground state for a certain double - well potential",

    "@xmath100 is antisymmetric , so that @xmath102      in order to perform the functional integration in eq.([fun ] ) , we first have to regularize it .",

    "in this paper , we have used functional integration to establish a relation between the fluctuating gap model , which describes one - dimensional electron motion in the presence of both a peierls distortion and quenched disorder , and the quantum motion of a particle in a double - well potential .",

    "above , we emphasized the strong relation between the calculation of the disorder average and the double - well problem .",
    "however , there is also a clear difference : in the double - well problem , an important role is played by multi - instanton configurations , in which instantons are followed by anti - instantons and _ vice versa_.@xcite although the action for the configuration containing @xmath152 instantons and anti - instantons is @xmath152 times the action of a single instanton @xmath153 , the multi - instanton contribution obtains a factor @xmath154 from the sum over all possible instanton positions ( @xmath155 is the imaginary time corresponding to @xmath17 ) .",

    "we note that it is the sum over all possible numbers of instantons and anti - instantons that gives the energy splitting between the two lowest states in the double - well potential.@xcite    by contrast , the asymptotic expression eq.([ansdos ] ) for the density of states in the fgm is given by only one instanton , which means that the largest contribution to the averaged density of states comes from a single disorder fluctuation .",
    "the origin of the difference lies in the fact that , while in the quantum double - well problem the anti - instanton describes a real physical process ( the tunneling between the wells in the direction opposite to the one described by the instanton ) , in the fgm it corresponds to zero disorder . to see this",

    "the large euclidean action eq.([eaction ] ) associated with this region is , however , completely compensated by the surface term eq.([baction ] ) in the infinite @xmath17 limit . to see this , one notes that even for infinite @xmath208 the time of motion @xmath17 along the instanton trajectory is finite , as the velocity grows very fast outside the well .",
    "we are , however , interested in long time ( large @xmath17 ) trajectories . the only way to make @xmath17 large is to tend the positive energy @xmath212 to zero , in which case the particle would spend most of the time near the maxima @xmath211 and @xmath83 of the potential @xmath215 , where it has a small velocity .",
    "the relation between the energy and the time of motion for large @xmath17 is , @xmath216 for @xmath207 the dependence of the energy on @xmath208 can be neglected .",
    "when the energy @xmath212 tends to zero , the trajectory given by eq.([difur1 ] ) inside the well , _",
    "i.e. _ , for @xmath217 , tends to the solution of eq.([difur ] ) with the plus sign . in other words , in the limit @xmath168 , this part of the trajectory becomes the instanton solution eq.([solution ] ) that we considered above . on the other hand ,",
    "outside the well ( @xmath218 ) the solution of eq.([difur1 ] ) tends to the solution of eq.([difur ] ) with the minus sign .",
    "the latter corresponds to zero disorder , @xmath91 , which explains the cancellation between the euclidean action coming from outside the well and the surface term .",
    "we proved , therefore , that in the limit @xmath219 the suppression factor @xmath75 for the instanton with boundary conditions eq.([ninf ] ) is identical to eq.([iaction ] ) .    the boundary conditions eq.([ninf ] )",
    "imply that the solution @xmath100 is antisymmetric .",
    "therefore , the jacobian @xmath123 given by eq.([jac ] ) equals unity , as before . at the same time , however , the values of the partial derivative @xmath220 and the determinant @xmath134 differ considerably from eqs .",
    "( [ pd ] ) and ( [ det ] ) , respectively .",
    "for instance , @xmath221 nevertheless , the product of the determinant and the partial derivative remains unchanged up to small corrections that vanish for @xmath168 .",
    "therefore , despite the fact that the instanton trajectories for the boundary conditions eq.([inf ] ) and eq.([bc ] ) are rather different , the average density of states obtained by the saddle - point integration near these trajectories is the same for sufficiently long chains , as , of course , should be the case ."
