    "we present a comparative study of transition region ( tr ) wind dynamics in @xmath3 aqr ( g2 ib ) , sw uma ( cv ) , @xmath4 dor ( f - g ia - iab ) and the sun , to develop semi - empiric radiative transfer models of the thermal structure of the stellar chromosphere and tr , and to determine the velocity and electron density structures .",
    "_ fuse _ spectra of the hybrid supergiant @xmath3 aqr have been observed for science team program p218 ( dupree et al .",
    "the classical @xmath16-cepheid variable @xmath4 dor was observed in aug . and oct .",
    "2003 for gi - d107 ( pi a. lobel ) , while the dwarf nova sw uma was observed in nov .",
    "2001 for gi - b074 .",
    "the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "1 shows non - lte radiative transfer fits to c  iii @xmath0977 through a semi - empiric model of the chromosphere and lower tr of @xmath3 aqr .",
    "the outward decrease of @xmath7 ( _ panels right _ ) produces a scattering core in the computed emission profile ( lobel & dupree 2000 ; 2001 ) , which assumes an asymmetric shape due to opacity in a fast accelerating wind .",
    "best multi - level atom model fits are obtained for @xmath17@xmath18140  @xmath6 in the lower tr ( @xmath19@xmath865 kk ) , which strongly scatters the blue emission line wing .",
    "the model signals a supersonic optically thick warm wind in the outer atmosphere of this hybrid supergiant ( lobel & dupree 2002 ) .",
    "the left - hand panels of fig . 2 show o  vi lines in the cataclysmic variable sw uma .",
    "the lines are remarkably far red - shifted with respect to heliocentric rest .",
    "we suggest that the double - peaked narrow profiles result from self - absorbed emission line formation in an infalling region near the white dwarf that is sufficiently optically thick at @xmath20 between 100 kk and 300 kk ( _ panels right _ ) .",
    "the depth of the o  vi @xmath01032 central absorption line core can only be computed with electron densities @xmath21 at least 1100 times larger compared to the solar tr values .",
    "the downflow velocity ( _ @xmath22 _ ) in the model is computed from the conservation of total mass in spherical geometry with @xmath23 , using a mass accretion rate @xmath24 of 1 @xmath14 @xmath15 , and @xmath25=0.01 @xmath26 .",
    "this @xmath24-value provides the best fit to the wavelength position of the central self - absorption core where @xmath22=@xmath2770 to @xmath2765 @xmath6 in the o  vi lines formation region .",
    "the upper left - hand panel of fig .",
    "3 compares the o  vi lines we compute with an atmospheric model of the average quiet sun with soho - sumer observations ( _ solid dots _ ) .",
    "the lines form over a rather small region of @xmath510 model layers with 100 kk @xmath11 @xmath20 @xmath11 300 kk , or @xmath5200 km into the solar tr above the upper chromosphere ( _ panels right _ ) .",
    "a best fit to the fwhm and equivalent width of the lines is obtained with projected microturbulence velocities ( @xmath28 ) increasing from at least @xmath530 @xmath6 to @xmath539 @xmath6 over this thermal range ( warren et al .",
    "a best fit to the core position of the o  vi @xmath01032 line is computed with a mean downflow velocity of @xmath275 @xmath6 .",
    "preliminary atmosphere models for @xmath4 dor ( _ lower left panel _ ) require @xmath28 exceeding 40 @xmath6 in the o  vi lines formation region to match the large line widths we also observe in @xmath3 aqr .",
