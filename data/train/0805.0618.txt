    "portfolio selection problem is one of the classical problems in the economics of uncertainty .",
    "the optimal portfolios depend on agents characters ( preference and wealth level ) and on the market s structure ( the risk - free return , the return and risk of the risky assets ) .",
    "various agents would have different allocations of wealth between the risk - free asset and the risky assets , due to the differences in preference and/or the differences in wealth level .",
    "the comparative statics of the optimal portfolios with respect to preference and/or wealth level has first been carried out by @xcite and @xcite , for a static model with a risk - free asset and a risky asset .",
    "for this model , if the excess return of the risky asset is positive , then ( i ) the more risk - averse an agent is , the less wealth is invested in the risky asset ; and ( ii ) if an agent displays decreasing absolute ( relative ) risk aversion , then the amount ( proportion ) of wealth invested in the risky asset is increasing in wealth .    since then , decades have passed .",
    "except for some specific cases such as constant absolute ( relative ) risk aversion in which the solutions can be explicitly worked out , few works have been reported for dynamic models , as far as we know , until @xcite . for a continuous - time complete market model , where the risky assets price process follows a joint geometric brownian motion , and for an agent who only consumes at the terminal time ,",
    "@xcite has analyzed the changes of the optimal portfolios across the wealth levels .",
    "the similar conclusions that hold for the static models have been obtained there by showing the indirect utility function inherits the decreasing absolute ( relative ) risk aversion from the von neumann - morgenstern utility function .",
    "( the indirect utility function also inherits the increasing relative risk aversion from the von neumann - morgenstern utility function .",
    "the preservation of decreasing ( increasing ) absolute risk aversion has been presented by @xcite , for static and complete models . )    the purpose of this paper is to investigate how the agents preference impacts the optimal portfolios for a market model with time - dependent and deterministic coefficients .",
    "here we compare the optimal portfolios across individuals instead of across wealth levels . as a result ( see theorem [ thm - main ] and section [ sec - conclu ] ) , we find that the indirect utility functions inherit the order of risk aversion from the von neumann - morgenstern utility functions .",
    "observing that the vector of optimal portfolio proportions is given by the vector of log - optimal portfolio proportions multiplied by the indirect relative risk tolerance , we know it is enough for any agent to replace investments in all assets with investments in the risk - free asset and a single  mutual fund \" , whose portfolio is log - optimal .",
    "based on these facts , a continuous - time version of comparative statics across individuals can be established : the more risk - averse an agent is , the less wealth is invested in the log - optimal portfolio , and hence , the less wealth in absolute value is invested in the risky assets . using the result here , almost all conclusions in @xcite on comparisons across wealth levels",

    "assertion ( ii ) can be proved by letting @xmath175 and by the same way .",
    "we can see from the preceding theorem and the discussion at the end of section [ sec - utility ] that , if the utility function of the agent exhibits drra ( resp .",

    "based on this observation , the extension to an incomplete market with deterministic coefficients is straightforward .    instead of a financial market with @xmath5 risky assets and driven by an @xmath5-dimensional standard brownian motion , we now consider an incomplete financial market with @xmath5 risky assets and driven by a @xmath177-dimensional standard brownian motion , @xmath178 . the @xmath19-th risky asset s price process @xmath20 satisfies the following equation : @xmath179 here @xmath180 is a @xmath177-dimensional standard brownian motion defined on a filtered probability space @xmath23 . set @xmath28 and @xmath181 .",

    "now we consider other @xmath183 risky assets whose price processes satisfies @xmath184 where the expected instantaneous rate of return of each asset is the risk - free rate @xmath18 and the coefficient @xmath185 makes the enlarged matrix @xmath186 non - singular .",
    "if we add these @xmath183 risky assets into the original market , then we have a larger market with @xmath177 risky assets . obviously , the larger market is complete .",
    "the larger market will not make an agent better off than the original market : no wealth will be invested in asset @xmath19 , @xmath187 , since the expected instantaneous rate of return of each asset @xmath19 , @xmath187 , is the risk - free rate @xmath18 . in the larger market , an agent will have the same optimal portfolio as in the original market .",
