    "the fusion energy generated in stars dominates the evolution of galaxies , heating and processing their interstellar media . however , our understanding of how stars form is incomplete .",
    "some fairly reliable empirical scaling laws exist , and a believable scenario exists for how an isolated low - mass star can form via disk accretion , but we lack a detailed understanding of how an entire molecular cloud turns into a cluster of stars .",
    "most stars form in cluster environments , and stellar densities imply some interaction between ysos during their formation",
    ". we must therefore analyze entire star forming regions , at long enough wavelengths to not be limited by extinction , and determine the physical properties of whole populations of young stellar objects ( ysos ) .",
    "trends in evolutionary state , mass , and spatial distribution can help distinguish between star formation scenarios such as competitive accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and predestination ( in which cores determine stellar masses , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one particularly vexing aspect of the complex and important topic of star formation is that of triggering .",
    "the formation of massive stars feeds energy back into the nearby interstellar medium , compressing , irradiating , and heating the natal molecular cloud .",
    "this feedback can have destructive or constructive effects , but it is not clear which dominates in a given cloud or overall in a galaxy . although many examples exist of regions in our galaxy and other galaxies with suggestive spatial distributions of young and somewhat younger stars , determining the relevant physical conditions and timescales to make a strong argument for triggering is more difficult .",
    "for some examples of these arguments , see the discussion of the galactic region w3/4 by @xcite , 30  doradus by @xcite , various regions and theory by @xcite , the particular case of cloud - crushing described by @xcite , and further theoretical considerations in @xcite .",
    "this issue must be clarified by making detailed assessment of whether triggered star formation is happening in particular molecular clouds .",
    "the eagle nebula ( m16 , containing the optical cluster ngc  6611 ) contains a well - studied region of possible triggered star formation , in the widely publicized `` pillars of creation '' or `` elephant trunks '' imaged with hst by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter h96 ) .",
    "ngc  6611 is a young open cluster , likely still in its formation stages . @xcite and @xcite found a spread in ages of the optically visible cluster members : the massive ( m@xmath0m@xmath1 ) stellar population is @xmath22@xmath31  myr old , with the most massive members apparently having begun to evolve off of the zams , and evidence of at least one evolved ( 6  myr old ) 30m@xmath1  star @xcite .",
    "there are also optically visible ( no longer embedded ) intermediate mass stars ( 38m@xmath1 ) that are still evolving onto the zams .",
    "the famous pillars are dense knots of molecular gas @xcite and dust which shield the region behind them from the destructive radiation of the o stars in the central cluster .",
    "h96 identified `` evaporating gaseous globules '' ( eggs ) in and around the pillars , and a central question has been whether the eggs are being compressed and forming stars fast enough before they are photo - destroyed .",
    "detailed near - infrared ( nir ) searches find that about 15% of the eggs have evidence of ysos @xcite .",
    "millimeter continuum and molecular lines @xcite reveal only one or two possibly younger objects in the pillars and at their base .",
    "mid ir imaging offers new insight into this region in at least two major ways .",
    "first , not all objects with protostellar dust show near - infrared ( jhk ) excess ( e.g. only half of ysos with 10@xmath4 m excess in taurus - auriga have nir excess ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and modeling protostellar spectral energy distributions ( seds ) is much more reliable with longer wavelength data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "second , the unprecedented mapping speed of _ spitzer _ allows imaging of a much larger area than the previous nicmos @xcite and ground - based @xcite studies centered on the pillars , permitting an investigation of the protostellar population in the entire region .",
    "this comprehensive assessment reveals star formation throughout the region , with the least evolved objects most highly clustered together .",
    "we also use mid - ir data to map the dust temperature and average extinction ; the ysos are preferentially located in regions of elevated dust temperature , and aside from ngc6611 which has cleared its natal molecular material , also preferentially located in regions of high extinction .    in section [ obs ]",
    "we describe the observations and compare several methods of selecting candidate ysos .",
    "we will use the term yso for any evolutionary state  heavily embedded , envelope dominated , disk dominated , or remnant disk ( commonly called class 0,i , ii , and iii for solar - mass objects ) .",
    "sections [ distro ] and [ individual ] respectively describe the nature of the population and of individual ysos in the region .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "m16 was observed as part of the galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire ( glimpse ) , a _ spitzer _ legacy program @xcite .",
    "the region was imaged with irac @xcite at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0@xmath4 m with two 1.2s exposures at each location .",
    "the point source sensitivities are approximately 0.5 , 0.5 , 1.0 , and 4.0 mjy in the four filters , somewhat brighter in regions of intense diffuse emission .",
    "sources were extracted from the images using the glimpse pipeline , built around a modified version of the psf - fitting program daophot ( * ? ? ? * babler et al in preparation ) .",
    "source detection and extraction is done in an iterative fashion .",
    "initial sources were detected at a 3-sigma level above the local background .",
    "these sources were subtracted from the image and then a second round of detection was run at a 5-sigma level to reveal sources that may have been missed in the wings of the psf of bright sources . after the second round of sources were extracted a third iteration of photometry was done to improve the fluxes . in regions of complex diffuse background , the source extractor can sometimes over - estimate or under - estimate the point source flux ( due to the difficulty of determining the local background ) .",
    "to remedy this situation , aperture photometry was done at the positions of extracted sources on the residual images ( the source subtracted images ) to check for excessive over- or under - subtraction of the source .",
    "if the initial extraction was indeed over- or - under subtracted , then the aperture photometry was used to adjust the initial extraction value .",
    "the pipeline has been rigorously tested against other extraction software and using a network of calibrator stars with flux densities predicted by spectral type and multiwavelength photometry ( m. cohen , private communication ) .",
    "our simulations indicate that the flux densities of truly pointlike sources are in general accurate to @xmath210% even in regions of high diffuse background .",
    "zero point flux densities ( vega magnitude system ) used in the glimpse v1.0 processing and this work are 280.9,179.7,115.0 , and 64.13jy for the irac bands , and we used a zero point magnitude of 7.16jy for our mips 24@xmath5 m photometry ( the irac calibration of * ? ? ?",
    "* is slightly different , and users of version 2 or higher glimpse products should refer to the accompanying documentation ) .",
    "sources detected at several wavelengths are cross - correlated ( bandmerged ) using the ssc banderger software , which is based on the 2mass bandmerger .",
    "potential matches are considered within 4  , and in confused regions , the association between all bands which minimizes the positional chi - squared is chosen .    for this study ,",
    "some of the sources of particular interest ( e.g. in the tips of the pillars ) were re - photometered by hand for this study , using irregular apertures and careful sky selection in regions of irregular diffuse emission .",
    "the results of the manual photometry were for the most part consistent with the pipeline extractions , but in a few cases of slightly extended sources , the manual fluxes were substituted .",
    "it should be noted that photometry is extremely difficult in very crowded regions with structured diffuse emission such as m16 , and although the glimpse pipeline performs as well or better than any other extractor we know of for irac data , one still needs to be very careful about cross - correlating sources between filters and resolving close pairs of sources at one wavelength but not another . as we discuss below , examination of each source s spectral energy distribution , and comparing it to model seds ,",
    "is actually a very good way to weed out bad matches and questionably photometry .",
    "sources were bandmerged with the 2mass all - sky catalog @xcite using the glimpse pipeline .",
    "the glimpse pipeline extracted over 42000 sources in the region ( within 0.45 degree of @xmath6=17.0 , @xmath7=0.8 , near ngc  6611 ) , and we wish to classify all of them in a consistent manner , as potential ysos , or reddened main sequence or post - main - sequence stars .",
    "we considered and compared four methods : 1 ) nir - excess sources in a jhk color - color plot 2 ) sources with a 224@xmath4 m spectral index greater than -2.0 3 ) sources in the irac color ranges of @xcite 4 ) sources better fit by a protostellar than stellar model sed .",

    "the two dividing lines are parallel to the reddening vector .",
    "we use e(j - h)/e(h - k)=1.75 , as in @xcite and @xcite , although a range between 1.6 and 2.0 has been observed in different molecular clouds and the diffuse ism @xcite .",

    "classically , the 2 - 24@xmath4 m spectral index ( power - law exponent fitting @xmath11f@xmath12 ) has been used to classify ysos , and to define the `` class i - ii - iii '' system ( lada , 1987 ) . in the _ spitzer _ era , many star formation regions have been mapped with arcsecond spatial resolution using the 3.68.0@xmath4 m irac camera @xcite , so it is useful to consider methods of selecting ysos based in irac photometry alone . however , whitney et al .",
    "( 2003a , b,2004b ) showed that the narrower wavelength range ( 3.68.0@xmath4 m v. 224@xmath4 m ) is more susceptible to 2-d effects ( inclination ) , and stellar temperature .",
    "the 8.0@xmath4 m band is also affected by the broad 10@xmath4 m silicate feature that could be either in emission or absorption .",
    "more recently , we have computed a large grid of yso models and found that while the 3.68.0@xmath4 m spectral index does correlate roughly with evolutionary state ( measured by circumstellar dust mass and accretion rate ) , there is significant spread ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  11 ) .",
    "classification based on irac colors uses more information about the sed than a simple spectral index over the same wavelength range , and may be more robust .",
    "figure  [ megeath ] shows the regions defined by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter a04 ) ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in irac color space .",
    "based on the solar - mass protostellar models of @xcite , those authors suggest that the sources in the central box are likely to be class  ii ysos , and redder sources class  i or younger .",
    "our models do not show as neat a separation in color - color space as a04 due to the larger range of parameter space explored in our grid @xcite .",
    "the deeply embedded sources show color variations due to inclination effects from scattering in the bipolar cavities , and sources of all evolutionary stages show color variations due to inner hole size and stellar temperature @xcite . in figure  [ megeath ]",

    "+   +    in this study we use a different type of classification of yso candidates ",
    "model sed fitting @xcite .",
    "this is accomplished using a program that fits all available fluxes to a large grid of model seds ( * ? ? ?",
    "* here we use fluxes between 1.25 and 24@xmath4 m , but any between the uv and millimeter are usable ) .",
    "our model grid consists of 2@xmath1410@xmath15 spectral energy distributions emitted by 2@xmath1410@xmath16 young stellar objects ( ysos ; 10 inclination angles each ) .",
    "the model grid is designed to span both theoretically and observationally reasonable ranges of mass , temperature , evolutionary state , disk mass , disk accretion rate , envelope mass , and envelope accretion rate .",
    "the colors of the model grid also span the full range of observed colors of stellar and young stellar objects .",
    "in addition to the 200000 yso models , our grid also includes 7853 stellar model atmospheres @xcite and 75 agb star templates derived from iso spectroscopy and spanning the range of evolutionary state and mass loss rate . the fitter returns",
    "a best - fit for each source as well as the distribution of templates and models that fit with smaller than a user - selected value of @xmath17 .",
    "we first select all sources that can be fit well ( @xmath17 per datapoint , or @xmath18 ) by an extinguished stellar atmosphere , and consider these consistent with stars . of the remaining sources ,",
    "if one can be fit with @xmath18 by any yso models , then we consider it a candidate yso .",
    "if it can not be fit well by either yso or stellar atmosphere , then it is likely poor photometry or bandmerging .",
    "this was confirmed by manual examination of the seds , and the process is robust to changes of the threshold goodness - of - fit between 2.0@xmath194.0 ( the number of sources in each category only changes by a few percent ) . for this analysis",
    "we consider yso models with distances between 1.5 and 2.5  kpc  as discussed in @xcite , if the distance to the sources can be constrained , the models can be better constrained by the data .",
    "analyzing as much of the sed as possible has several advantages . in crowded regions with bright complex diffuse emission such as m16 , examination of the sed",
    "provides an extra check to remove bad data points .",
    "for example , we found several sources that were resolved from a close companion at h band and by irac , but not in the 2mass k@xmath13 data , resulting in anomalously high k@xmath13 fluxes ( which would be interpreted as a nir excess ) .",
    "sed analysis is robust to instrumental artifacts and bad data in a single filter - color - color analysis requires good photometry in four filters ( the four irac filters for example ) , whereas we can admit measurements with larger uncertainties in some filters , but are protected against introducing many false ysos because if the resulting sed is inconsistent with any stellar or protostellar model , it can be eliminated from the analysis .",
    "perhaps most interesting is the ability to understand the constraints afforded by the data in as objective a way as possible .",
    "if the photometry of a given source is consistent with a wide range of circumstellar dust models , but inconsistent with any stellar atmospheres , the source can still be classified as a probable pre - main - sequence object , but at the same time it is known that the data do not allow the evolutionary state ( disk - only or accreting envelope ) to be determined .",
    "this is philosophically similar to choosing all sources with spectral index greater than some threshold , or all sources with some threshold infrared excess . in this manner",
    ", we use the model fitter to determine _ upper limits _ to the evolutionary state of sources in m16 : namely , if a source is not fit by any stellar atmosphere with @xmath202.5 , but is fit at least that well by some yso models , the source is considered a yso candidate . if the source is fit by models with accreting envelopes , but can not be well - fit by any disk - only model ( no accreting envelope ) , then we consider the source a candidate to be quite young ( perhaps class  i for a solar - mass object ) .",
    "finally , if the source can be fit by models with circumstellar disks more massive than 10@xmath21m@xmath22 ( where m@xmath22 is the central source mass in the model ) , but is not fit by any models with less massive disks , then we consider the source to be a candidate accretion disk source ( similar to class  ii for a solar - mass object ) .",
    "figure  [ indexfitter ] compares the classification suggested by our model fitter with the nir excess ( for sources which jhk detection allows calculation ) and mir spectral index .",
    "red points have a high probability of being relatively unevolved with massive envelopes , orange points likely have still - accreting circumstellar disks , and green points are yso candidates for which the existing data can not place strong constraints on the circumstellar dust distribution .",
    "we see that yso candidates generally fall in the regions defined by a04 .",
    "the constraints suggested by the model fitter are less well - defined than the box drawn by a04 , as expected given a range of inclination , stellar masses , and inner disk holes .",
    "one should also remember that the colors plotted are _ upper limits _ to the evolutionary state , and the source may have more massive envelopes or disks , but the existing data do not allow that to be unambiguously determined .",
    "foreground extinction also moves sources vertically in this color space ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which explains some orange points lying above the box .",
    "some of the orange points to the right of the box ( large [ 5.8]-[8.0 ] , moderate [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] ) have inner holes in their dust envelopes . in the case of sources",
    "for which the data can constrain the circumstellar dust distribution , there is a correlation between less evolved objects ( red points ) and higher mir spectral indices .",
    "+   +    several characteristics of the fitter classification compared to a classification based only on irac color are particularly important . comparing the second panels of figures  [ megeath ] and [ indexfitter ] , we see that the multi - band fitter finds many more young sources that did not have jhk detections ( the dots on the right - hand side of figure  [ indexfitter ] ) .",
    "our fitter can characterize a source with measured fluxes in as few as four bands between j and [ 24 ] , whereas a nir excess characterization clearly requires jhk detections and an irac - color characterization requires detections in all four irac bands .",
    "the latter can be difficult in regions of high diffuse emission , like a star formation region .",
    "( a similar effect to fitting an sed to all bands can probably be achieved by classifying sources in multiple color - color planes ; megeath et al .",
    "2005 , allen et al . 2005 ) .",
    "careful examination of the entire sed allows the removal of confused sources or those with poor photometry , which is less obvious in a color - color ( nir or irac ) plot .",
    "finally , comparison of the sed with as many different yso models as possible provides a relatively unbiased way to assess the _ degree _ to which the data can constrain the modeled nature of the source , beyond assigning a most likely model based on colors .",
    "figure [ glossy ] shows the eagle nebula in the [ 3.6 ] , [ 4.5 ] , and [ 8.0 ] bands .",
    "the optical open cluster is the concentration of blue stars to the nw of the hst pillars ( marked in fig  [ overview ] ) .",
    "protostellar candidates selected using our fitter are shown on a [ 8.0 ] image in figure  [ overview ] .",
    "many of the protostellar candidates are located in the ngc  6611 cluster , which is known to be very young .",
    "in fact , nearly all of the sources in the ngc  6611 region are classified as yso candidates : 46 of the 47 sources with high signal - to - noise detections in at least 4 bands between 1 and 10@xmath4 m and located in a 4  diameter region around ngc  6611 were classified as yso candidates .",
    "this is consistent with a very high l - band ( 3.5@xmath4 m ) excess fraction ( 85@xmath35% ) determined by @xcite and the large number of emission - line stars seen by @xcite , implying that circumstellar disks are fairly robust , even in a cluster environment .",
    "our analysis reveals a new cluster to the ne ( at 18h19m10s , -13d36 m , approximately 7  in diameter ) .",
    "located in a dark region indicative of a dense cloud , the new cluster is likely younger than ngc  6611  as seen in figure  [ overview ] , most of the new cluster s sources can be constrained to have accreting disks ( yellow ) or envelopes ( red ) , compared to ngc  6611 which has many sources consistent with remnant disks ( green ) .",
    "there is also a concentration at the head of a large pillar at 18h19m05s -13d45m20s ( `` pillar 5 '' ; we analyze this region in more detail below , ",
    "[ p5 ] ) . finally , there is a low density of scattered protostellar candidates across the region shown .",
    "this apparent interspersed ongoing star formation ( also noted in the giant hii region rcw49 by @xcite and in orion by @xcite ) could possibly be a superposition of background objects , but at least some of them are likely ysos , indicating widespread low - level activity throughout the cloud .",
    "a byproduct of our fitting program is the best - fit extinction to each source , including the large number of extinguished main - sequence and giant stars along the line - of - sight .",
    "these values can be binned to produce a map of the average extinction , which is shown as contours in figure  [ extinction ] .",
    "we expect that the molecular cloud associated with star formation in m16 dominates the extinction measured with this procedure , and indeed the features match other indicators of dense material .",
    "ngc  6611 is located in a low - extinction region , likely evacuated by the cluster itself .",
    "high - extinction regions correspond reasonably well with the boundaries of the bubble delineated by pah emission in the the irac bands and scattered light in the nir .",
    "there is a concentration of dense gas to the ne of ngc  6611 , and more star formation on the other ( north ) side of the cloud , in regions of somewhat lower extinction .",
    "we compared the spatial distributions of ysos as a function of evolutionary state and mass , and found no obvious variations with either parameter other than the likely younger ne cluster .",
    "since our maximum extinction through the cloud is a@xmath2320 , which is 1 magnitude of extinction at irac wavelengths @xcite , we can still detect ysos down to masses of about 0.5m@xmath1 , and we do not expect to be missing any significant star formation in the region .",
    "the combination of mid - ir imaging at different wavelengths allows one to directly compare the protostellar population to the properties of the molecular cloud in which they are forming .",
    "first , we use iras 60@xmath4 m and 100@xmath4 m images to determine the temperature of the dust : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the emissivity index , @xmath26\\lambda^{-\\beta}\\ ] ] ( see e.g. * ? ?",
