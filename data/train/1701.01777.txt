    "the balloon s density can be changed to control its vertical velocity ( and , hence , its altitude ) , and the balloon s motion can be well approximated as the motion of a massless particle carried by the flowfield    [ eqn : system ] @xmath9    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are random variables denoting the horizontal and vertical positions , @xmath12 is the vertical gradient of the time - averaged horizontal velocity ( i.e. , @xmath13 is the time - averaged horizontal velocity at height @xmath14 ) , and the turbulent fluctuations of the horizontal velocities are characterized by a white gaussian noise @xmath15 with zero mean and spectral density @xmath16 . neglecting the vertical velocity fluctuations , the balloon moves in the horizontal direction according to a brownian motion with a probability distribution function ( pdf ) @xmath17 with horizontal mean @xmath18 and variance @xmath19 . in the uncontrolled case ,",
