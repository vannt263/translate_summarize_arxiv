    "one of the few phenomena , which are specific to the _ intrinsic _ josephsoneffect and can not be seen in arrays of conventional superconductors , is the interaction of the josephson oscillations and phonons . this has been observed experimentally in the form of resonances in the @xmath0-@xmath1-characteristics at low voltages @xcite .",
    "their main features could already be understood theoretically in the framework of a simple lattice dynamical model of damped local oscillators in the barrier @xcite .    despite the clear evidence of the effect a general multi - band theory , in which parameters like the phonon frequencies or the oscillator strength in the dielectric function are specified microscopically , is still missing and",
    "shall be presented in the following .",
    "this more general formalism is in principle appropriate to include the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the dynamical matrix as obtained in _ any _ microscopic lattice dynamical calculation into the josephson theory .",
    "qualitative effects of the phonon dispersion are discussed in a simple rigid ion model , e.g. the van - hove singularity at the upper edge of the acoustical band , which can be detected in the @xmath0-@xmath1-curve .",
    "details of the derivation and further results can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the josephson effect between the layers @xmath8 and @xmath9 is described by a rsj - like equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the bias current ( density ) , @xmath12 the supercurrent , @xmath13 the quasiparticle current and @xmath14 the gauge - invariant phase difference , which is related to the average electric field @xmath15 in @xmath2-direction in the barrier : @xmath16 ( @xmath17 : thickness of the barrier ) .",
    "in contrast to this , the displacement current density @xmath18 does not depend on @xmath19 , but the field @xmath20 set - up by the conduction - electron charge - fluctuations @xmath21 on the layers , which obey the poisson equation @xmath22 and the continuity equation @xmath23 .",
    "all quantities are constant along the layers ( @xmath24 ) as in short junctions .",
    "the crucial point is to determine the ( linear ) relation between the field @xmath25 created by the charge fluctuations alone and the total electric field @xmath26 due to both electrons and ions .",
    "this can be described by the ( longitudinal ) phonon dielectric function @xmath27 where the suszeptibility ( @xmath28 : phonon branch ) @xmath29 and the oscillator strength @xmath30 depend on the eigenvalues @xmath31 and eigenvectors @xmath32 of the dynamical matrix @xmath33 , which contains all the short and long range interaction between the ionic cores in the insulating state .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath31 therefore represent the _ bare _ phononfrequencies in the absence of the charge fluctuations @xmath21 .",
    "the appearence of special @xmath34-dependent effective charges @xmath35 in equ .",
    "[ osc ] reflects the different contribution of ions on and between the superconducting layers and is one of the distinctions to the conventional dielectric function .",
    "the function @xmath36 has zeros at the longitudinal eigenfrequencies @xmath37 of modes with polarization in @xmath2-direction .",
    "a similar consideration @xcite shows the general form @xmath38 of the phononic dielectric constant , which reduces in special cases to the longitudinal @xmath39 and transversal dielectric constant @xmath40 , which is relevant in optical experiments .    with the knowledge of the phononic dielectric function @xmath41 the @xmath0-@xmath1-curve",
    "can be calculated with the ansatz @xmath42 by linearizing in the small oscillating parts @xmath43 .",
    "the final result for the first branch ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) @xmath46 exhibits a phonon resonance _",

    "[ epseff ] .    as a reliable microscopic lattice dynamical theory for the dynamical matrix",
    "is not yet available and as the intrinsic josepshon effect has to be treated in a phenomenological ( one - band ) picture until the details of the pairing mechanism are understood , the above results will be illustrated qualitatively in a simple model of a two - atomic chain of masses @xmath49 and charges @xmath50 .",
    "if the mass on the layer ( @xmath51 ) is larger than the one in the barrier ( @xmath52 ) , the acoustical van - hove singularity is suppressed , but the optical band shows a double peak at the band edges ( cf .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , the distance being the bandwidth .",
    "the ( more realistic ) case of @xmath53 exhibits single peaks at the upper edges of both acoustical and optical bands and is compared with experiment in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] .",
    "if several junctions are in the resistive state , their dynamics is coherent due to the coupling with phonons , even if no other ( e.g. inductive ) interaction is present .",
    "this is important for the application of short junctions as effective high - frequency devices .",
    "analytical expressions similar to equ .",
    "[ iv1 ] for the second branch can in principle distinguish different phase locked solutions in the @xmath0-@xmath1-characteristic @xcite .",
    "the zeros of the real part of the total dielectric function @xmath54 define the frequencies @xmath55 of the collective modes of the coupled conduction electrons and phonons , where the josephson plasma frequency is given by ( @xmath56 : coherence length ) : @xmath57 these modes are different from the bare phonon bands @xmath58 and can in principle be observed in neutron scattering . in fig .",
    "[ kollfig ] the plasma band @xmath59 for @xmath60 mixes with the longitudinal acoustical ( la ) and optical ( lo ) phonon modes @xmath61 , which are almost dispersionless on this scale .",
    "note especially that a frequency gap of width @xmath62 appears in the spectrum , which is _ formally _ ( not physically ) similar to the polariton dispersion of coupled phonons and photons @xcite .",
    "recently the explanation of the subgap resonances in refs.@xcite with the phonon coupling mechanism presented here could be well confirmed by raman measurements on the same samples @xcite and infrared reflectivity experiments with grazing incidence @xcite ( see table [ phonon_tab ] ) .",
    "note that in our theory also raman - active or silent modes may couple to intrinsic josephson oscillations for @xmath63 and that in contrast to optical experiments ( at the @xmath64-point ) the whole brioullin zone contributes in an average way ( cf .",

    "also the behaviour in external pressure is consistent with the phonon interpretation @xcite .    beyond this , in the more general model developed above resonances at van - hove singularities , e.g. at the upper band edge of the acoustical phonon band , can be described .",
    "this might be an explanation for a peak seen in @xcite at @xmath72 mv ( @xmath73 thz ) in the @xmath0-@xmath1-characteristic of tl@xmath4ba@xmath4ca@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath74 , as the same frequency is predicted in lattice dynamical calculations @xcite for the upper edge of the acoustical band and because there are no optical phonon bands at that low frequency ( cf .",
