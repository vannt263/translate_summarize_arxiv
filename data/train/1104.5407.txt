    "determination of the equation of state ( eos ) for isospin asymmetric nuclear matter ( anm ) is among fundamental questions in both nuclear physics and astrophysics .",
    "knowledge on the nuclear eos is important for understanding not only the structure of finite nuclei , the nuclear reaction dynamics , and the liquid - gas phase transition in nuclear matter , but also many critical issues such as properties of neutron stars and supernova explosion mechanism in astrophysics  @xcite . in the past",
    "more than @xmath10 years , significant progress has been made in determining the eos of symmetric nuclear matter from subsaturation density to about @xmath11 times normal nuclear matter density @xmath12 by studying the nuclear isoscalar giant monopole resonances ( isgmr )  @xcite , collective flows  @xcite and subthreshold kaon production  @xcite in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "on the other hand , the isospin dependent part of the nuclear eos , characterized essentially by the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath13 , is still largely uncertain  bar05,lck08 .",
    "lack of knowledge on the symmetry energy actually hinders us to extract more accurately the eos of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "therefore , to explore and narrow down the uncertainties of both the theoretical methods and the experimental data is of crucial importance for extracting more stringently information on the nuclear eos .    during the past more than 30 years",
    ", it has been established that the nuclear isgmr provides a good tool to probe the nuclear eos around the nuclear normal density . in particular , it is generally believed that the incompressibility @xmath4 of symmetric nuclear matter can be extracted from a self - consistent microscopic theoretical model that successfully reproduces the experimental isgmr energies as well as the ground state binding energies and charge radii of a variety of nuclei  bla80 .",
    "experimentally , thanks to new and improved experimental facilities and techniques , the isgmr centroid energy @xmath0 , i.e. , the so - called nuclear breathing mode energy , of @xmath1pb ( a heavy , doubly - magic nucleus with a well - developed monopole peak ) has been measured with a very high precision ( less than @xmath14 ) .",
    "indeed , a value of @xmath15 mev was extracted from the giant monopole resonance in @xmath1pb based on an improved @xmath16-scattering experiment  you99 ( another value of @xmath17 mev was extracted in ref .",
    "the @xmath0 of @xmath1pb has been extensively used to constrain the @xmath4 parameter in the literature  @xcite .",
    "it is thus important to estimate and eventually narrow down the theoretical uncertainty of extracting @xmath4 from the nuclear isgmr .",
    "theoretically , in fact , it has been found that the uncertainty of the density dependence of the symmetry energy has significantly influenced the precise extraction of the @xmath4 parameter from isgmr in @xmath1pb and it also provides an explanation for the observed model dependence of the @xmath4 extraction from the isgmr in @xmath1pb based on non - relativistic and relativistic models  @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we estimate the theoretical uncertainty when one extracts the @xmath4 parameter from the nuclear isgmr based on microscopic hartree - fock ( hf ) + random phase approximation ( rpa ) calculations with skyrme interactions .",
    "in particular , we study the correlations between the isgmr centroid energy and properties of anm with a recently developed analysis method  @xcite in which instead of varying directly the @xmath18 parameters in the skyrme interaction , we express them explicitly in terms of @xmath18 macroscopic quantities that are either experimentally well constrained or empirically well known . then , by varying individually these macroscopic quantities within their known ranges , we can examine more transparently the correlation of the isgmr centroid energy with each individual macroscopic quantity and thus estimate the theoretical uncertainty of the isgmr centroid energy based on the empirical uncertainties of the macroscopic quantities .",
    "our results indicate that the density slope @xmath2 of the symmetry energy and the isoscalar nucleon effective mass @xmath3 can significantly change the @xmath0 of @xmath1pb and the present uncertainties of @xmath2 and @xmath3 can lead to a theoretical uncertainty of about @xmath7 mev for the extraction of @xmath4 .",
