    "nonclassicality of the radiation fields has been at the heart of quantum optics .",
    "one uses detectors which work by absorption of photons and hence normally ordered correlations are the ones measured directly  @xcite .",
    "nonclassicality in quantum optics has been therefore formulated in terms of the nonclassical properties of the @xmath2  function associated with the density matrix of the quantum fields  @xcite . however , the @xmath2  function itself is not directly measurable .",
    "mandel introduced an experimentally deducible measure of nonclassicality , namely the @xmath0 parameter , defined by @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 being the classical mean value and the classical variance of the photoelectric statistics  @xcite . if @xmath0 is negative , then the photo counting statistics is of sub - poisson type and we conclude that the field is nonclassical .",
    "the very first experimental demonstration of this nonclassical effect was given in  @xcite .",
    "more recently it has become necessary to use photon number resolving ( pnr ) detectors to discriminate between states with definite photon numbers  @xcite .",
    "since such detectors are not directly available , one uses on - off detector systems ( avalanche photodiodes )  @xcite .",
    "such detector systems have been characterized by tomographic methods  @xcite .",
    "the deduction of nonclassicality using measurements with avalanche photodiodes and using the mandel @xmath0 parameter meets with difficulties .",
    "for example , even if the field is completely classical , then @xmath0 can be negative  @xcite .",
    "in this article we present a solution to this difficulty by introducing an appropriate measure of nonclassicality using the data from on - off detector systems . the condition @xmath6 characterizes the sub - binomial click statistics of light .",
    "we provide a physical justification for the new measure and we show by several examples the validity of the binomial @xmath1 parameter .",
    "whenever the discrimination of adjacent photon numbers is of relevance for applications in modern quantum technologies , the notion of sub - binomial light is expected to play a vital role .",
    "the traditional detectors work on the principle that a photo electron is emitted if a photon is absorbed .",
    "perturbation theory shows that the emission probability is proportional to the intensity of light and this leads to the counting distribution  @xcite , @xmath7 herein , the operator @xmath8 represents the photon number , @xmath9 the detection efficiency , @xmath10 the number of noise or dark counts , and the @xmath11 notation indicates the normal ordering prescription . for on - off detectors the mechanism is different . the detector clicks for any number of photons and does not click if the field is in the vacuum state .",
    "we showed recently that if one employs @xmath12 on - off detectors , then the counting distribution is given by  @xcite @xmath13 we also observed , that the counting or click statistics converges to the true statistics with increase in the number of detectors .",
    "however this convergence is slow as it goes as @xmath14 . for coherent states ,",
    "( [ eq : truestat ] )  and  ( [ eq : pnrcounting ] ) reduce to the poisson and binomial statistics , respectively .    since the counting distribution has a different form",
    ", one would expect that one needs a measure different from the mandel @xmath0 parameter to characterize nonclassicality .",
    "note that the traditional photo counting distribution involves the expectation of a normally ordered poisson distribution , whereas the click statistics involves a normally ordered binomial one .",
    "we expect that an appropriate measure of the nonclassical statistics would be the _ sub - binomiality _ of the distribution .",
    "hence we introduce @xmath1 defined by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mean number of clicks , and @xmath17 the variance of the click statistics @xmath18 , @xmath19 the moments @xmath16 and @xmath17 are defined the sense of classical probabilistic quantities .",
    "this @xmath1 possesses the properties :    1 .",
    "the @xmath1 parameter must not yield negative values for classical states ; 2 .   for any quantum state having a binomial counting statistics @xmath18 , @xmath1 should be zero ; 3 .",
    "it is based on first and second moments of @xmath18 ; 4 .   for @xmath20",
    ", @xmath1 should converge to @xmath0 .",
    "the definition of @xmath1 requires at least two on - off detectors .",
    "a single on - off detector only yields one click and no click with probability @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , respectively .",
    "thus , any quantum state has a binomial statistics , @xmath24 , as long as a single detector is used .",
    "we next prove that @xmath6 is a measure of nonclassicality for measurements with @xmath12 on - off detectors . for this purpose , it is convenient to use the generating function of the click statistics @xmath25^n{:}\\rangle .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the derivatives of @xmath26 , one can obtain all moments of the statistics .",

    "appendix  a. rewriting this equation according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : qn ] ) , @xmath30 we obtain the binomial @xmath1 parameter in its explicite form .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath1 , as it is clearly seen from this result , depends on higher - order moments of the photon number statistics , which is not the case for mandel @xmath0 parameter given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : q ] ) .",
    "such higher order moments are beginning to be studied in experiments  @xcite . for a classical state ,",
    "when the @xmath2-function has the properties of a classical probability distribution  @xcite , it yields that any normally ordered variance is non - negative .",
    "in addition , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are non - negative mean values .",
    "it follows for classical states @xmath33 let us note that the individual expectation values are independent of the phase .",
    "altogether , this proves the claim that a negative binomial @xmath1 value implies a nonclassical photon statistics .    concerning the convergence properties of @xmath1 , we can use the following result . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have already shown , that the click statistics converges to the photo statistics for @xmath20 .",
