    "in born s interpretation of the wave function @xmath0 at time @xmath1 of a single particle of mass @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the probability density for finding the particle at @xmath4 at that time .",
    "the consistency of this interpretation is ensured by the continuity equation @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the quantum current ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the quantum current is usually not considered to be of any operational significance ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "it is not related to any standard quantum mechanical measurement in the way , for example , that the density @xmath8 , as the spectral measure of the position operator , gives the statistics for a position measurement .",
    "nonetheless , it is hard to resist the suggestion that the quantum current integrated over a surface gives the probability that the particle crosses that surface , i.e. , that @xmath9 is the probability that a particle crosses the surface element @xmath10 in the time @xmath11 .",
    "however , this suggestion must be taken `` cum grano salis '' since @xmath12 may be somewhere negative , in which case it can not be a probability .",
    "but before discussing the situations where @xmath13 can be negative we want to consider first a regime for which we can expect this quantity to be positive , so that its meaning could in fact be the crossing probability , namely , the regime described by scattering theory .",
    "in textbooks on quantum mechanics the principal objects of interest for scattering phenomena are nonnormalized stationary solutions of the schrdinger equation with the asymptotic behavior @xmath14 where @xmath15 represents an incoming wave , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the scattered wave with angular dependent amplitude .",
    "@xmath18 gives the probability for deflection of the particle in the direction specified by @xmath19 by the well - known formula for the differential cross section @xmath20 this representation of a scattering process is , however , not entirely convincing since born s rule is not directly applicable to non - normalizable wave functions .",
    "more important , this picture is entirely time - independent whereas the physical scattering event is certainly a process in space and time . indeed , according to some experts , the arguments leading to the formula ( [ bornform ] ) for the cross section `` would nt convince an educated first grader '' ( @xcite , p.  97 ) .    it is widely accepted that the stationary treatment is justified by an analysis of wave packets evolving with time . using a normalized wave packet @xmath21 one immediately obtains by born s rule the probabilities for position measurements .",
    "but what are the relevant probabilities in a scattering experiment ?",
    "in mathematical physics ( e.g.  @xcite , p.  356 , and @xcite ) an answer to this is provided by dollard s scattering - into - cones theorem  @xcite : @xmath22 this connects the asymptotic probability of finding the particle in some cone @xmath23 with the probability of finding its asymptotic momentum @xmath24 in that cone , where @xmath25 is the wave operator ( `` @xmath26 '' denotes the strong limit ) , @xmath27 , with @xmath28 , and @xmath29 denotes the fourier transform .",
    "it is generally believed that the left hand side of the scattering - into - cones theorem  is exactly what the scattering experiment measures , as if the fundamental cross section associated with the solid angle @xmath30 ( to be identified with a subset of the unit sphere ) were @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the cone with apex at the origin subtended by @xmath30 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "to connect this with ( [ bornform ] ) , which is independent of the details of the initial wave function , one may invoke the right hand side of the scattering - into - cones theorem  to recover the usual formula with additional assumptions on the initial wave packet ( see @xcite p.   356",
    "for a discussion of this . )",
    "so far the mathematics . but back to physics .",
    "the left hand side of the scattering - into - cones theorem  is the probability that at some large but fixed time , when the position of the particle is measured , the particle is found in the cone @xmath23 .",
    "but does one actually measure in a scattering experiment in what cone the particle happens to be found at some large but _ fixed _ time ?",
    "is it not rather the case that one of a collection of distant detectors surrounding the scattering center fires at some _ random _ time , a time that is not chosen by the experimenter ? and is nt that random time simply the time at which , roughly speaking , the particle crosses the detector surface subtended by the cone ?",
    "this suggests that the relevant quantity for the scattering experiment should be the quantum current .",
    "if the detectors are sufficiently distant from the scattering center the current will typically be outgoing and ( [ jdotdsigma ] ) will be positive .",
    "we obtain as the probability that the particle has crossed some distant surface during some time interval the integral of ( [ jdotdsigma ] ) over that time interval and that surface .",
    "the integrated current thus provides us with a physical definition ( see also @xcite , p.  164 ) of the cross section : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the intersection of the cone @xmath32 with the sphere of radius @xmath35 ( see fig .  1 ) . as before , one would like to connect this with the usual formulas and hence we need the counterpart of the scattering - into - cones theorem  the flux - across - surfaces theorem  which provides us with a formula for @xmath36 : @xmath37    the fundamental importance of the flux - across - surfaces theorem  was first recognized by combes , newton and shtokhamer @xcite . to our knowledge there exists no rigorous proof of this theorem , although the heuristic argument for it is straightforward .",
    "let us consider first the `` free flux - across - surfaces theorem , '' where @xmath38 : @xmath39 ( this free theorem , by the way , should be physically sufficient , since the scattered wave packet should in any case move almost freely after the scattering has essentially been completed ( see also @xcite ) . )",
    "now the current should contribute to the integral in ( [ fasfreet ] ) only for large times , because the packet must travel a long time before it reaches the distant sphere at radius @xmath35 .",
    "thus we may use the long - time asymptotics of the free evolution .",
    "we split @xmath40 into @xmath41 since @xmath42 as @xmath43 , we may neglect the second term , so that as @xmath44 we have that @xmath45 ( this asymptotics has long been recognized as important for scattering theory , e.g.@xcite . ) from ( [ asymp ] ) we now find that @xmath46 ( note that by ( [ jasympheu ] ) the current is strictly radial for large times , so that @xmath47 is indeed positive . )    using now the approximation ( [ jasympheu ] ) and substituting @xmath48 we readily arrive at @xmath49    @xmath50    this heuristic argument for the free flux - across - surfaces theorem  ( [ fasfreet ] ) is so simple and intuitive that one may wonder why it does not appear in any primer on scattering theory .",
    "( for a rigorous proof see @xcite ) .",
    "to arrive at the general result ( [ fast ] ) one may use the fact that the long time behavior of @xmath51 is governed by @xmath52 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) so that the asymptotic current is simply @xmath53 yielding ( [ fast ] ) .",
    "we turn now to a much more subtle question ( see also @xcite ) : what happens if we place the detectors _ not _ too distant from the scattering center and prepare the wave function near the scattering center , i.e. , what happens if we do not take the limit @xmath54 so central to scattering theory ?",
    "the detectors will of course again fire at some random time and position , but what now of the statistics ?",
    "this question is not quite as innocent as it sounds ; it concerns in fact one of the most debated problems in quantum theory : what we are considering here is the problem of time measurement , specifically the problem of escape time ( and position at such time ) of a particle from a region @xmath55 .",
    "it is well known that there is no self - adjoint time observable of any sort and there is a huge and controversial literature on this and on what to do about it .",
    "( see @xcite and references therein . )",
    "note also that since the exit position is the position of the particle at a random time , it can not be expressed as a heisenberg position operator in any obvious way .",
    "the obvious answer ( see @xcite for a one - dimensional version ) is , of course , provided by ( [ jdotdsigma ] ) , provided that the boundary of @xmath55 is crossed at most once by the particle ( whatever this is supposed to mean for a quantum particle ) , so that every crossing of the boundary of @xmath55 is a first crossing , and provided of course that ( [ jdotdsigma ] ) is nonnegative . in ( [ jdotdsigma ] )",
    "should of course be understood as referring to the schrdinger evolution with no detectors present . ]",
    "notice that the preceding provisos might well be expected to be intimately connected .",
    "we thus propose that ( [ jdotdsigma ] ) indeed gives the first exit statistics whenever the following current positivity condition ( a condition on both the wave function and on the surface ) @xmath56 is satisfied .",
    "we predict that the statistics given by ( [ jdotdsigma ] ) will ( approximately ) be obtained in an experiment on an ensemble of particles prepared with ( approximately ) cpc wave function @xmath57 which is initially well localized in some region @xmath55 whenever the detectors around the boundary of @xmath55 ( see fig .  2 ) are _ sufficiently passive _ , a condition that needs to be more carefully delineated but which should widely be satisfied . as to how widely the cpc is satisfied ,",
    "this is not easy to say .",
    "we do note , however , that since whether or not it is satisfied depends upon the region @xmath55 upon which we focus and around which we place our detectors , it may often be possible to suitably adjust the region @xmath55 so that the cpc becomes satisfied , at least approximately , even if the cpc fails to be satisfied for our original choice of @xmath55 .",
    "a simple example of a situation where the cpc does hold and where one may easily compute the exit - time statistics is the following .",
    "a spherically symmetric gaussian wave packet , with initial width @xmath58 , which is initially located at the center of @xmath55 , a sphere with radius @xmath35 , evolves freely .",
    "one readily finds for the exit time probability density @xmath59 that @xmath60    of course , some important questions remain : the expression ( [ jdotdsigma ] ) is not a probability for all wave functions  so what if anything does it physically represent in general ? and what in the general case is the formula for the first exit statistics ?",
    "we stress again that the prediction ( [ jdotdsigma ] ) for the exit statistics is not of the standard form , as given by the quantum formalism , since it is not concerned with the measurement of an operator as observable .",
    "however , no claim is made that the expression ( [ jdotdsigma ] ) and its interpretation can not also be arrived at from standard quantum mechanics ",
    "it presumably can  e.g . , by including the measurement devices in the quantum mechanical analysis .",
    "( see however @xcite . ) after all , though there is no standard quantum observable ( i.e. , self - adjoint operator ) to directly describe the escape time , the `` pointer variable '' for the detectors _ is _ a standard quantum observable , whose probability distribution after the experiment can in principle be computed in the standard way .    in the next section",
    "we shall explain how the current as the central object for escape and scattering phenomena arises naturally within bohmian mechanics @xcite , where the physical meaning of ( [ jdotdsigma ] ) turns out to be the measure for the expected number of _ signed _ crossings , which of course can be negative .",
    "in bohmian mechanics a particle moves along a trajectory @xmath61 determined by @xmath62 where @xmath0 is the particle s wave function , evolving according to schrdinger s equation .",
    "moreover , if an ensemble of particles with wave function @xmath57 is prepared , the positions @xmath4 of the particles are distributed according to the quantum equilibrium measure @xmath63 with density @xmath64 ( @xmath57 normalized ) @xcite .",
    "hence , given @xmath0 , the solutions @xmath67 of equation ( [ bm1 ] ) are random trajectories , where the randomness comes from the @xmath68-distributed random initial position @xmath69 , @xmath57 being the initial wave function .",
    "consider now , at time t=0 , a particle with wave function @xmath57 localized in some region @xmath70 with smooth boundary .",
    "consider the number @xmath71 of crossings by @xmath72 of the surface element @xmath73 of the boundary of @xmath55 in the time @xmath11 ( see fig .",
    "splitting @xmath74 , where @xmath75 denotes the number of outward crossings and @xmath76 the number of backward crossings of @xmath73 in time @xmath11 , we define the number of signed crossings by @xmath77    we can now compute the expectation values with respect to the probability @xmath78 of these numbers in the usual statistical mechanics manner .",
    "note that for a crossing of @xmath73 in the time interval @xmath79 to occur , the particle has to be in a cylinder of size @xmath80 at time @xmath1 .",
    "thus we obtain for the expectation value @xmath81 and similarly @xmath82    if we further introduce the random variables @xmath83 , the first exit time > from @xmath55 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 , the position of first exit , @xmath86 , we obtain a very natural and principled explanation of what we arrived at in a heuristic and suggestive manner in our treatment of scattering theory and the statistics of the first exit time and position . for bohmian mechanics",
    "the cpc implies that every trajectory crosses the boundary of @xmath55 at most once , and in this case we have @xmath87 and we find for the joint _ probability _ of exit through @xmath73 in time @xmath11",
    "@xmath88    in principle one could compute the first exit statistics also when the cpc fails to be satisfied .",
    "these are in fact given by the same formula ( [ popran ] ) as before , provided one replaces @xmath89 by the truncated probability current @xmath90 arising from killing the particle when it reaches the boundary of @xmath55 .",
    "this is simply given , on the boundary of @xmath55 , by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a first exit from @xmath55 if the bohmian trajectory passing through @xmath4 at time @xmath1 leaves @xmath55 at this time , for the first time since @xmath93 .",
    "thus , we have generally that @xmath94    however , there is an important difference between the cpc probability formula ( [ popran ] ) , involving the usual current , and the formula ( [ popshit ] ) , involving the truncated current .",
    "the usual current is well defined in orthodox quantum theory , even if it is true , as we argue , that its full significance can only be appreciated from a bohmian perspective .",
    "the truncated current can not even be _ defined _ without reference to bohmian mechanics , since whether or not @xmath92 is a first exit from @xmath55 depends upon the full and detailed trajectory up to time @xmath1 .",
    "( in particular , a different choice of dynamics , as for example given by stochastic mechanics @xcite , would yield a different truncated current .",
    "it is natural to wonder whether the truncated current given by bohmian mechanics provides in the general case the best fit to the measured escape statistics expressible without reference to the measuring apparatus . )",
    "finally , we note that in the context of scattering theory our definition ( [ sigmaflux ] ) of @xmath95 captures exactly what it should once one has real trajectories , namely the asymptotic probability distribution of exit positions , @xmath96 this follows from the fact that the expected number of backward crossings of the sphere of radius @xmath35 vanishes as @xmath54 ( see @xcite ) .",
