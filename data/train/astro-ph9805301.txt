    "any dynamical and nonspherical self - gravitating astrophysical  or cosmological  system of mass m and size r is a potential source of gravitational waves .",
    "the most powerful ones are those combining a very asymmetric shape together with a violent nonstationary evolution .",
    "in present paper we are interested in the gravitational waves radiated by cosmological objects .",
    "flattened structures as superclusters and walls show great departures from spherical symmetry , but they are evolving in the mildly nonlinear regime and , consequently , their evolution is slow .",
    "gravitational waves from these structures will be considered elsewhere .",
    "galaxy clusters evolve in the strongly nonlinear regime and their dynamics is expected to be faster than in the case of larger flattened structures ; however , departures from spherical symmetry seem to be small ( even if their corresponding initial conditions were fully asymmetric ) . in this case ,",
    "high density contrasts  of the order of @xmath1  are reached and , consequently , fully nonlinear numerical simulations are necessary . this paper concerns with the characteristics of the gravitational radiation released during galaxy cluster evolution .",
    "as it is well known , clusters contain dark matter ( @xmath2 ) and a subdominant baryonic component ( @xmath3 ) . since the dynamics and spatial distribution of these components are different , the ratio between the gravitational luminosities coming from these two components is not expected to be constant .",
    "numerical simulations including a baryonic component  gravitationally coupled to the dark one  are necessary to describe the evolution of that ratio .    taking into account the above discussion",
    ", a two components cluster , mimicking the observed ones , has been simulated numerically , paying particular attention to estimate its gravitational luminosity and the features of the radiated gravitational waves . to this aim",
    "we have used the approach of considering that the sources satisfy the constraints of the so - called nearly newtonian slow motion . as far as we know",
    ", similar calculations have not been performed up to now , probably due to some pessimistic point of view justified by the combination of great numerical difficulties ( 3d calculations ) together with very disappointing small values expected for the gravitational - wave luminosity , the amplitude , et cetera .",
    "however , our results have been more encouraging than we could foresee . a new observable effect has been found .",
    "hereafter , @xmath4 stands for the cosmological time , @xmath5 is the age of the universe .",
    "@xmath6 stands for the derivative of the function x with respect to the cosmological time .",
    "the present value of the hubble constant is assumed to be @xmath7 .",
    "quantities @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively .",
    "greek ( latin ) indices run from 1 to 4 ( 1 to 3 ) .",
    "a flat universe , cold dark matter ( cdm ) , and adiabatic energy density fluctuations are assumed .",
    "the corresponding spectrum is normalized by the condition @xmath10",
    ". constrained gaussian realizations of the density field  in the position space  can be obtained by using the method proposed by hoffman and ribak ( 1991 ) and improved by weygaert and bertschinger ( 1996 ) .",
    "we have used this powerful tool to obtain an initial density field  at redshift z=100  containing the cluster seed centered in a box .",
    "the constraints have been introduced in such a way that , after evolution , our initial overdensity leads to a feasible rich cluster ( see quilis et al .",
    "1998 for details ) .",
    "it is assumed that the 90 % of the matter is cdm and the remaining , the baryonic one , is assumed to be a monoatomic ideal gas .",
    "the initial values for the velocity field of both components are identical .",
    "no assumptions about the symmetry of the object have been done at all .",
    "the resulting departures from spherical symmetry correspond to an arbitrary statistical realization of the density field .    the cosmological hydrodynamic equations describing the evolution of the baryonic component ( see peebles , 1980 ) are solved using a hydro - code based on _ modern high - resolution shock - capturing techniques_. this code was described in quilis et al .",
    "the motion of dark matter particles is studied by means of a standard _ particle mesh _ code ( hockney and eastwood 1988 ) .",
    "the total gravitational field is computed by solving the poisson equation which couples baryons and dark matter with a multidimensional method based on fast fourier transform ( press et al .",
    "details about our galaxy cluster simulations are described in quilis et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .    at present time",
    ", the simulated cluster has : ( i ) a x - ray luminosity of @xmath11 , ( ii ) a temperature of @xmath12 , and a total mass inside the abell radius ( @xmath13 ) of @xmath14 ; hence , we are considering a rich cluster having features compatible with present observations ( beringer , 1991 ; peebles , 1994 ) .",
    "our cluster evolves in a flat universe and it is observed with a detector of gravitational waves moving with the cosmological expanding background .",
    "this is the most natural reference frame in cosmology and it is locally minkowskian at any time . the metric distance from the detector to the cluster , @xmath15 , is proportional to the scale factor @xmath16 .",
    "its present value is assumed to be @xmath17 .",
    "gravitons reaching the detector at present time were emitted by the cluster at time @xmath18 ( emission event e ) .",
    "could we perform our calculations in the minkowskian space tangent to the robertson - walker spacetime at e ?",
    "the particle point of view is appropriate to answer this question .",
    "the emission and propagation of gravitons in the real and tangent spaces are now compared : ( i ) since graviton emission only depends on the internal dynamics of the system , and it is the same in both cases , the same amount of gravitons with the same energies are emitted , ( ii ) the background universe as well as the minkowski empty spacetime are transparent to graviton propagation and , ( iii ) we have studied the null geodesics in both spacetimes to calculate the times @xmath19 ( robertson - walker ) and @xmath20 ( minkowski ) elapsed by a graviton in reaching detectors located at the same distances from the cluster .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 appear to be identical to first order in the parameter @xmath21 .",
    "this parameter is much smaller than unity because the distance @xmath22 is much smaller than the horizon scale of @xmath23 .",
    "this means that , in both cases , the detectors are receiving signals coming from the same retarded positions of the cluster .",
    "after these considerations we can state that our estimates can be performed in the minkowskian tangent space .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that gravitons are travelling in a region whose size is much smaller than that of the horizon . only for far clusters observed from distances comparable to that of the horizon ( @xmath24 ) , the minkowskian point of view",
    "is not valid and the approach used in this paper must be improved .    since",
    "our calculations can be carried out in the minkowskian tangent space and galaxy clusters are far of being relativistic in both senses , special relativity , i.e. , @xmath25 , and general relativity @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the schwarzschild radius of the object ) , these clusters can be described by using the so - called slow - motion formalism .",
    "the spacetime metric can be linearized in the usual way ( @xmath28 ) , the transverse traceless ( tt ) gauge can be used and , everywhere outside the cluster ( misner , thorne & wheeler , 1973 ) , the spatial components of @xmath29 are h_ij^^tt= _ ij ( t- ) [ hij ] where @xmath30 are the components of the traceless inertial tensor .",
    "the contribution of the baryonic fluid , @xmath31 , is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is kronecker s delta , @xmath34 is the baryonic density , and @xmath35 the physical coordinates .",
    "the cdm contribution , @xmath36 , is given by the following summation extended over all the cdm particles,@xmath37 , @xmath38 being the number of cdm particles and @xmath39 the mass of each particle . finally , we compute @xmath40 . outside the cluster ,",
    "the relative motion of two neighbouring particles a and b moving with the cosmological background ( ideal detector ) is fully described by the quantities @xmath41 . in tt gauge , there is a system of coordinates attached to a , in which the coordinate variations of the particle b are x^i__b(t)-x^i__b0 = x^j__b0 [ h^^tt_ij(t)]__a [ detec ] where @xmath42 stands for the initial coordinates of the particle @xmath43 and the quantities @xmath41 are calculated at point @xmath44 . from this formula",
    ", it follows that oscillations in the @xmath41 quantities lead to oscillations in the relative position of particles a and b with related frequencies and amplitudes .    in the slow motion approximation , the gravitational luminosity , @xmath45 ,",
    "is given by the well known formula [ lum ] l__gw = g _ ij^1,3 _ ij _ ij  .",
    "since @xmath30 is the addition of two terms , the gravitational luminosity can be decomposed in the following evident manner , @xmath46 . a direct calculation of @xmath45 based on eq.([lum ] ) would be very problematic ( finn and evans , 1990 ) as a result of the difficulties coming from the numerical noise inherent to the numerical computation of third order time derivatives .",
    "however , as several authors have suggested ( see , e.g. , mnchmeyer et al .",
    "1991 ) , the second order time derivatives involved in @xmath47 can be written in terms of the quantities @xmath48 and , @xmath49 , which , in its turn , can be expressed in terms of related variables , taken advantage of the corresponding system of equations governing the motion of baryonic and cdm components .",
    "figure 1 shows our numerical estimates of @xmath50 ( crosses ) , @xmath51 ( triangles ) and @xmath52 ( piecewise continuous line ) versus quantity @xmath53 . at redshifts between @xmath54 and @xmath55 , cdm and baryons",
    "have roughly the same velocity profiles and proportional ( according to their relative abundances ) density fields . as a consequence ,",
    "the mass is the only relevant parameter and quantity @xmath51 is smaller than @xmath56 .",
    "since evolution leads to a cdm configuration more stationary and spherically symmetric than the baryonic one , the luminosity @xmath51 becomes dominant at @xmath57 .",
    "the total luminosity @xmath52 is a little greater than @xmath58 in the redshift intervals ( 25,30 ) and ( 3,7 ) .",
    "the fact that luminosities appear to be similar in both periods can be easily understood taking into account that , in the first interval , deviations from spherical symmetry are greater than in the second one , while dynamics is more violent between redshifts @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the luminosity , assumed constant , of a source radiating a total energy of @xmath61 during the age of the universe is @xmath62 .",
    "this means that the efficiency of the gravitational - wave emission from the cluster is @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , we can not expect any energetically significant gravitational - wave background generated by galaxy cluster evolution .",
    "quantities @xmath64 and @xmath65 have been evaluated along the world line of an observer moving with the background who carries the ideal detector of section 3 .",
    "the z - axis has an arbitrary direction and the gravitational wave travels along this axis .",
    "quantities @xmath66 and @xmath67 oscillate with time having very large characteristic periods .",
    "taking into account that , according to eq .",
    "( [ hij ] ) , quantities @xmath66 and @xmath67 are proportional to @xmath68 , one easily concludes that the variations of amplitudes are proportional to @xmath69 ( effect of background expansion ) .",
    "hence , the oscillations of the quantities @xmath70 and @xmath71 also have varying amplitudes , but the variations of these new amplitudes only depend on the cluster evolution itself .",
    "these quantities are plotted , as a function of @xmath4 , in fig .",
    "it is noticeable that the luminosities and amplitudes given in figs .",
    "1 and 2 are compatible with rough estimates based on formulae from other astrophysical scenarios ; in fact , according to shapiro & teukolsky ( 1983 ) the gravitational - wave luminosity of a self - gravitating system of mass m , size r and typical velocity @xmath72 is l__gw l_0  , [ lgw ] being @xmath73 . for our simulated cluster is @xmath74 , and eq .",
    "( [ lgw ] ) leads to @xmath75 .",
    "moreover , the relative strain or amplitude of the gravitational wave signal coming from a collapsing object at a distance @xmath76 of the terrestrial detector  in a form well - adapted to our cosmological scenario  is ( shapiro & teukolsky , 1983 ) h 3 10 ^ -11 [ h2 ]  . for our simulated cluster ( @xmath77 ) ,",
    "( [ h2 ] ) leads to @xmath78 .",
    "finally , schutz ( 1997 ) gives the following alternative formula : h 5 10 ^ -11 [ heff2 ]  , where @xmath79 is the frequency of the wave . in the case of our cluster ,",
    "the characteristic dynamical time is @xmath80 .",
    "this gives @xmath81 .",
    "furthermore , we have @xmath82 , and @xmath83 . taking into account all these data , eq .",
    "( [ heff2 ] ) leads to @xmath84 .    after describing figs . 1 and 2 and",
    "analyzing their contents and consistency , let us focus our attention on an important consequence .",
    "the characteristic periods of the waves coming from the cluster are larger than @xmath85 years and , obviously , it is not possible to detect any complete pulse .",
    "however , we are going to show that the oscillatory fields @xmath66 and @xmath67 produce an effect which could be observable  during an admissible integration time  with a standard detector like the one described in eq .",
    "( [ detec ] ) .",
    "in fact , during the time interval @xmath86 , the distance between two particles a and b aligned with the _ x _ or _ y _ axis undergoes a relative variation @xmath87_{0 } \\delta t$ ] and , when the particles are aligned with the directions forming angles of @xmath88 with these axis , their relative distance have changed in a quantity given by @xmath89_{0 } \\delta t$ ] . the above derivatives  to be performed at present time  can be estimated from the data displayed in the curves of fig .",
    "the resulting values are @xmath90_{0 } = -1.26 \\times 10^{-20 } \\ yr^{-1}$ ] and @xmath91_{0 } =   -4.65 \\times 10^{-21 } \\",
    "yr^{-1}$ ] . in brief",
    ", our simulated cluster produces changes in the relative distance of the order of @xmath92  detectable with current technology  in a short period of _ four days_. this variation in the relative distance is an effect which would last  at the same rate  for many years ; in this sense , we can speak about a _ secular effect_. the relative separation distance would vary regularly reaching the order of @xmath93 after one decade .",
    "we have proved that gravitational radiation from clusters does not contribute significantly to the density parameter .",
    "a new effect produced by the gravitational waves emitted by a cluster has been described .",
    "a cluster with the features of the observed ones has been simulated in the standard cdm model . in other cosmogonies , the effect produced by clusters having these features is expected to be comparable .",
    "this is because the clusters producing the secular effect are located near the observer and , consequently , their evolution well inside the horizon is dominated by internal interactions .",
    "simulations support this idea , see , e.g. , huss , jain & steinmetz ( 1998 ) , who claim that the differences between individual cluster realizations of a given model are more important than the differences within differing scenarios for a given realization .",
    "however , the properties of the spatial distribution of clusters depend on the chosen scenario strongly",
    ". a few words about detection and future work are worthwhile .",
    "we could take advantage of the fact that the secular effect can be observed for many years . in order to do that ,",
    "this effect should be measured during periods greater than the characteristic time of any time varying gravitational field acting on the detector .",
    "thus , the pulses produced by these fields could be seen as local perturbations of the secular effect .",
    "if the detector is pointing towards a certain direction , it is not receiving gravitational waves from an unique cluster ; hence , the calculation of the total effect produced by a set of clusters is important . for the sake of briefness , we present a rough estimate based on idealized cluster distributions within a sphere of radius @xmath94 .",
    "all the clusters are identical to that of this paper .",
    "the distance between any pair of clusters is constrained to be larger than a fixed distance @xmath95 .",
    "no cluster correlations are considered .",
    "given an observation direction , the contribution of each cluster to the relative variation of the distance between particles @xmath44 and @xmath43 ( detector ) is assumed to be @xmath96 with @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the angle formed by the line of sight of the cluster and the observation direction . since clusters do not radiate in a coherent way , their contributions to @xmath99 are not correlated .",
    "this fact is simulated by using the random number @xmath100 uniformly distributed in the interval ( -1,1 ) .",
    "the factor ( 100/d ) has been introduced because the effect of a given cluster decreases with distance as @xmath101 ( see eq .",
    "( [ hij ] ) ) .",
    "after superimposing the contribution of all the clusters , the mean @xmath102 and the standard deviation @xmath103 have been calculated from the @xmath99 values corresponding to many observation directions . for each pair ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) , various simulations have been done . the mean @xmath102 changes from one to another , but @xmath103 is a very stable quantity . for the pairs ( @xmath104 , @xmath105 ) , ( @xmath104 , @xmath106 ) , ( @xmath107 , @xmath105 ) , we have found @xmath108 , @xmath109 and , @xmath110 , respectively . from these data",
    "one concludes that , for @xmath111 , quantity @xmath103 depends on @xmath94 weakly .",
    "this fact suggests that the use of radius @xmath112 is not necessary because the main part of the effect is produced by nearby clusters .",
    "furthermore , the resulting @xmath103 values are greater than the value @xmath113 maximum value assumed for a single cluster and d=100 even when large separations ( @xmath106 ) are assumed .",
    "the large @xmath103 values given by simulations strongly suggests the feasibility of anisotropy measurements .",
    "improved simulations including cluster correlations should increase the anisotropy .",
    "the effect of realistic spatial distributions including correlations and clusters with different masses , sizes , et cetera will be studied elsewhere .",
    "various parameters as the proportions between baryonic and dark matter , the density parameter , et cetera would be involved in these simulations .",
    "the resulting anisotropy would depend on both cosmological and large scale structure parameters",
    ". comparisons between measurements and predictions of the secular effect and its anisotropies could play a crucial role in modern cosmology .",
