    "@xcite the authors solve the coupled channel unitarity equations for the @xmath2 , @xmath37 and @xmath36 form factors , using the chiral resonance model and various @xmath38-matrix parametrizations of the scattering amplitudes . by construction",
    ", the watson theorem is satisfied by the @xmath2 form factor @xmath20 , while the two integration constants entering the solution of the coupled channel equations are fixed by the values of @xmath20 at @xmath85 and @xmath192 cf .",
    "callan - treiman relation ( [ ct ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath20 calculated in @xcite satisfies the same low energy constraints which we imposed .",
    "however , in our formalism the form factor is constrained above the inelastic threshold only by the @xmath80 condition ( [ l2 ] ) ( or ( [ l21 ] ) ) .",
    "this puts a weak restriction on the modulus @xmath193 , which is allowed to increase like @xmath31 at asymptotic energies , while in @xcite the @xmath194 asymptotic decrease predicted by perturbative qcd is imposed .",
    "analyticity is also implemented in a different way in the two approaches : in our formalism it is expressed by the relations ( [ g ] ) and ( [ gtaylor ] ) , where the real coefficients @xmath81 obey only the constraints that were explicitly incorporated .",
    "so , we work with the most general class of functions which satifies these constraints . on the other hand , in @xcite",
    "the form factor is expressed by a dispersion relation with the spectral function related to the meson - meson transition amplitudes , described by several specific parametrizations . choosing a restricted class of functions leads to a smaller error , but may introduce a bias , so the errors given in @xcite might be underestimated .    of course , the information provided by the inelastic channels is important .",
    "the contribution of other two - particle states can be implemented in a rigorous way in the present formalism , as shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the higher states in the unitarity relation ( [ unit ] ) involve the modulus squared of the @xmath36 and @xmath37 form factors above the corresponding unitarity thresholds .",
    "their unphysical cuts can be eliminated by exploiting watson theorem with a generalized omns formalism @xcite .",
    "we shall investigate this problem in a future work .",
    "other generalization , easily implementable , is the introduction of higher derivatives at zero momentum transfer , which are related to the chiral constants of @xmath26pt .",
    "we mention finally that the inequalities derived above can be used also in the opposite way , for bounding the quark masses using the information on the low energy expansion parameters of the strangeness changing scalar form factors .",
    "this problem was investigated for instance in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our approach offers the possibility to include simultaneously various pieces of information , like callan - treiman constraint ( [ ct ] ) and @xmath2 phase shift @xmath195 through watson theorem .",
    "for instance , using the predictions of the radius and the curvature made in @xcite we obtain the lower bound @xmath196 . the prediction made in @xcite based on a qcd sum rule is tighter since the authors use the spectral function of the two point function @xmath197 calculated from the values of the @xmath2 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 form factors on the unitarity cut .",
    "we have derived and evaluated unitarity bounds on the slope and curvature of the scalar strangeness changing form factor @xmath20 .",
    "the method incorporates in an exact mathematical way low energy theorems like callan - treiman condition and watson final state interaction theorem .",
    "our results indicate that the curvature can not be neglected in the representation of the experimental data on @xmath17 decay . using the calculation of the form factor to two loops in @xmath26pt",

    "generalizations of the method , including the @xmath36 and @xmath37 form factors in the unitarity sum for the spectral function , and their higher derivatives at the origin , can increase the predictive power of the present formalism .",
