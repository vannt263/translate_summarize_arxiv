    "due to such spatial correlations in metastable patterns , the uncorrelated noise @xmath123 in the avalanche flow equation for abelian cases should be replaced by some correlated noise to represent ns metastable patterns .",

    "fig : and](c ) . this can be explained by an intuitive argument . as discussed in the last part of sect .",
    "[ sect : flow analysis ] , the stochasticity inherent to toppling arrows reveals only in the case when the unstable boundary site , say , @xmath13 at the right boundary , has @xmath11 grains and its neighboring site at the next layer , say , @xmath96 , is occupied by @xmath31 grains . assuming that the grain distribution is uniform ( to be confirmed ) , the probability of an occupied site having @xmath31 grains is about @xmath264 .",
    "if the unstable site has @xmath11 grains , it might have been occupied by @xmath31 or @xmath201 grains before receiving grains from the unstable neighboring site at the previous layer , whose probability is about @xmath264 .",

    "[ fig : and](a ) , which may mislead to conclude no crossover for the larger @xmath11 values even if they are odd .",
    "we here pose the following question : _ how can we know whether or not any crossover behavior is observed at the sufficiently large layer ? _ the value of @xmath76 is not sufficient enough to answer the question .",
    "we need to investigate the grain distribution @xmath267 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qzt ] ) that contains the detailed information for metastable grain patterns . due to the fact that the @xmath268 becomes dominant as @xmath47 increases for non - abelian dsms",

    "figure  [ fig : and](d ) shows the broadness of @xmath239 for @xmath266 and the peaked structure of @xmath239 for @xmath230 .",
    "this implies that the shape of the grain distribution is one of the good indicators to identify the universality class , as well as the grain density exponent in metastable patterns .",
    "the effect of the quenched randomness in the and is compared to that of the annealed randomness in the pnd .",
    "the scaling behaviors of @xmath75 in the pnd with @xmath45 for various @xmath11 values exhibit qualitatively the same behaviors as those in the and ( not shown ) . since the scaling behavior of @xmath75 in the and ( @xmath134 ) at @xmath161 is quite different from that in the bnd ( @xmath194 ) at the same @xmath11 value , one can ask if another crossover behavior exists between them . at each value of @xmath41 close to @xmath72 in the pnd , we are able to observe the crossover behavior of the grain occupation density from @xmath194 to @xmath133 at some crossover layer , @xmath249 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pnd_rho](a ) .",
    "we numerically find that the value of @xmath249 scales as @xmath272 , [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : pnd_rho](b ) ] .",
    "such scaling is roughly explained by the following argument : the degree of stochasticity per toppling event is simply given by @xmath42 . the total number of realizations up to the layer @xmath47 is on the order of @xmath273 for @xmath257 .",
    "thus , the stochasticity begins to appear when @xmath274 , which implies that @xmath275 .",

    "such deviation affects other scaling behaviors .",

    ", we investigate another kind of crossover behaviors from the ns class to the mf class in the ns as @xmath11 increases up to @xmath245 .",
    "this is motivated by lbeck s work  @xcite that reported the crossover behavior between the undirected ns and the undirected cnd for very large @xmath11 values ( up to the order of @xmath278 ) . in the undirected",
    "ns , if @xmath279 grains topple at an unstable site , its neighboring sites will receive grains of @xmath280 on average with the standard deviation of @xmath281 .",
    "thus , for sufficiently large @xmath11 values , the stochasticity in toppling rules is effectively suppressed and the system shows the deterministic universality class . it was claimed that universality classes can be determined in the context of the shape of grain distributions : the grain distribution is broad for the undirected stochastic class , while it is narrow with multiple peaks for the undirected deterministic class . in the similar sense , one can expect essentially the same crossover from the ns class to the mf class in the directed case as @xmath11 increases to the sufficiently large value , i.e. , by suppressing fluctuations in @xmath28 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ns_all](a ) , we observe two kinds of crossover behaviors of grain occupation densities in dsms .",
    "one is from @xmath134 ( ns class ) to @xmath72 ( mf class ) as @xmath11 increases , as expected .",
    "the other is from @xmath194 to @xmath133 at a fixed @xmath11 value as @xmath47 increases . here",
    "the crossover layer , @xmath249 , depends on the @xmath11 value .",
    "we systematically observe that the shape of @xmath239 at @xmath282 is much narrower than that at @xmath246 for any layer @xmath47 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : ns_all](b ) ] .",
    "it implies the mf class for much larger @xmath11 values , which is hardly confirmed in numerical simulations .    finally , we discuss the crossover mechanism from the mf class to the ns class at a fixed @xmath11 value for the directed case .",
    "the mechanism is different from that for the undirected case .",
    "the numbers of toppled grains at unstable sites on the top layer @xmath23 are always @xmath11 .",
    "then , @xmath283 has the normal distribution with the mean value of @xmath284 and the standard deviation on the order of @xmath285 , as well as an additional peak around @xmath286 .",
    "the latter peak is due to the sites that have received grains both from the neighboring sites on the top layer , but are still stable .",
    "this peaked structure implies the mf class .",
    "inevitable fluctuations around two peaks in the @xmath267 at small @xmath47 propagate and accumulate through layers , and finally result in the broad distribution without any distinguished peaks .",
    "if the value of @xmath11 was sufficiently large enough to exclude any fluctuations ( approximately the cnd ) , the mf behavior would be clearly observed without any crossover behaviors . in other words , for the finite @xmath11 values , there always exists crossovers from the mf class to the ns class at some finite crossover layer .",
    "we studied both non - abelian stochastic ( ns ) and mean - field ( mf ) universality classes and crossover behaviors between two classes in various non - abelian directed sandpile models ( dsms ) on a two - dimensional tilted lattice .",
    "the broken abelian symmetry induces spatially long - range correlations in metastable patterns .",
    "the universality class of avalanche dynamics can be identified by means of the grain density exponent in metastable patterns : @xmath134 for the ns class and @xmath194 for the mf class . due to some ambiguity of the non - abelian deterministic toppling rule against the given lattice structure , we considered the toppling bias for the last grain .",
    "we found that the parity of the threshold value , @xmath11 , might change the universality class . using extensive numerical simulations",
    ", we confirmed that mf behaviors are well observed in the and for even @xmath11 values and in the bnd for any @xmath11 values as @xmath11 increases . for odd @xmath11 values ,",
    "the toppling randomness in the and and in the pnd with @xmath45 becomes relevant , so that they belong to the ns class .    in the and and the pnd with @xmath45 for large odd @xmath11 values",
    ", we numerically observed crossover behaviors from @xmath194 to @xmath133 at some crossover layer , @xmath249 .",
    "the crossover layer is a function of the @xmath11 value and the partial bias , @xmath41 , in the pnd . since the grain density exponent is not sufficient to determine the universality class under some circumstances , we suggest checking the broadness of the grain distribution in metastable patterns as well . here",
    "the broadness originates from the stochastic nature in toppling rules . as in the undirected case",
    ", we also observed that the ns class undergoes the crossover to the mf class as @xmath11 increases . at a fixed @xmath11 value",
    ", another crossover is found from the mf class to the ns class at a finite value of @xmath249 .    in conclusion",
    ", we emphasize that one should be very careful to set the toppling bias and the threshold value for some appropriate minimal model of self - organized criticality in order to explain experimental results .",
    "it is because the naive setting of parameters may mislead to either unexpected universality classes or crossover behaviors .",
    "finally , it would be worthwhile to extend our various tests towards some other lattice structures , to clarify the crossover scaling issues more analytically , and to test other types of non - abelian dsms , such as sticky sandpiles and sandpiles with bulk dissipation  @xcite .",
    "this work was supported by the bk21 project and by nap of korea research council of fundamental science and technology ( mh ) .",
