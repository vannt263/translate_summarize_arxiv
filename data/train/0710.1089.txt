    "more precisely , the operator is defined through the closure of the quadratic form @xmath8 on @xmath9 .    before stating our main results we would like to recall some well - known semi - classical spectral asymptotics and estimates for the dirichlet laplacian @xmath10 and its magnetic version @xmath11 , @xmath12 being an arbitrary vector potential .",
    "if @xmath5 is bounded then the spectrum of @xmath10 is discrete , and by a classical result due to weyl ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) one has , as @xmath13 , @xmath14 for all @xmath15 .",
    "note that the right - hand side involves the symbol @xmath16 on the phase space @xmath17 .",

    "the sharp constant obviously can not be smaller than 1 , and by an argument of aizenman and lieb @xcite , it is a non - increasing function of @xmath21 .",

    "berezin @xcite and independently li and yau @xcite ( see also @xcite ) proved for @xmath24 with the sharp constant @xmath25 .",
    "this also yields the so far best known bound on the sharp constant for @xmath22 , namely @xmath26 .",
    "indeed , @xmath27 and the claim follows by optimization with respect to @xmath28 .",
    "we note that the estimate for @xmath22 and @xmath29 is closely related to the estimates @xmath30 for the eigenvalues @xmath31 of the operator @xmath10 .",
    "the form , however , shows the close connection with the lieb - thirring inequality , see @xcite and also the review article @xcite .",

    "one finds the values @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively . in @xcite",
    "the estimate is shown to hold for @xmath44 with constant @xmath23 _ in the special case of a homogeneous magnetic field _ @xmath45",
    "it was recently shown in @xcite that does _ not _ hold with constant @xmath23 if @xmath46 , not even when @xmath5 is tiling .",
    "moreover , the authors determined the optimal constant such that holds for all @xmath20 under the constraint that @xmath12 is given by and @xmath5 is tiling .    in this paper we shall consider @xmath12 corresponding to an aharonov - bohm magnetic field and we shall prove the estimate @xmath47 with a constant @xmath48 given explicitly in terms of bessel functions . even though our bound is probably not sharp , it improves upon the previously known estimates",

    "@xmath51 here @xmath52 denotes the aharonov - bohm operator in the whole space . in @xcite",
    "an analogous estimate was proved in the case _ with constant _ 1 when @xmath53 .",
    "the authors conjectured that such an inequality is not true for an arbitrary magnetic field , but their counterexample contains a gap ; the condition 2 ) on p. 905 can not be satisfied by a non - trivial radial vector field , as it was first pointed out by m.  solomyak .",
    "this gap can be removed by a minor change in the argument , since the assumption of radial symmetry is not essential in the proof @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we feel that our example is of independent interest and sheds some light on the particularities of the aharonov - bohm operator .",
    "what we prove is that the sharp constant in is strictly greater than unity , see theorem [ diamagthm ] . we establish this by a thorough study of the local spectral density of the operator @xmath54 , see section  [ sec : density ] .",
    "we mention in closing the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , where lieb - thirring estimates for the schrdinger operator @xmath55 were obtained .",

    "we recall that @xmath310 and @xmath312 share the same spectrum .",
    "similarly , the eigenvalue problems for @xmath313 , @xmath314 and @xmath315 are reduced to @xmath316 in order that the general solution @xmath317 satisfy the dirichlet conditions we need to fix the ratio @xmath318 and take @xmath96 such that @xmath319 equivalently , @xmath320 is an eigenvalue whenever @xmath302 is a zero of the cross - product @xmath321 for @xmath322 , @xmath323 . since the amplitude of the oscillation grows approximately as @xmath324 , the computation of the zeros is nontrivial for large orders . by searching in the negative @xmath325 direction and making use of the simple fact",
    "that the asymptotic spacing of the zeros is @xmath326 @xcite , we circumvent much of these difficulties in comparison to routines such as mathematica s _",

    "for @xmath332 the absence of radial symmetry prevents us from solving the eigenvalue problem for @xmath333 exactly .",
    "we therefore resort to the finite element method as implemented in comsol multiphysics to compute approximate eigenvalues .",
    "a 8,800-element mesh , gradually refined near the singularity , is used to compute the 250 lowest eigenvalues , all less than 840 . providing an a priori bound on the computational error",

    "figure  [ fig : rf5 ] is the analogue of figure  [ fig : aeigv ] for @xmath335 .",
    "we are obviously constrained to computing with @xmath20 restricted to a finite interval but provided this interval is sufficiently large it should be possible to tell the behaviors depicted in figures  [ fig : ltinf ] and [ fig : ltnoncl ] apart . particularly if the function @xmath296 tends steadily to @xmath23 from below we",
    "can conclude with certainty that its supremum will eventually be this number in virtue of the eigenvalue asymptotics .",
    "it turns out that _ all the operators we consider , whether @xmath100 or @xmath327 , seem to obey a semi - classical eigenvalue estimate with unit constant for both @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",

    "note that @xmath296 has the most irregular behavior in the cases @xmath100 and @xmath337 due to the high degree of degeneracy of the eigenvalues , cf .",
