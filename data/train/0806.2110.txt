    "the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) , an esa  nasa mission to survey the gravitational - wave ( gw ) sky at frequencies between @xmath0 and @xmath1 hz , will record gravitational radiation from millions of sources , most of them in our galaxy , but many populating the low - to - high  redshift universe @xcite .",
    "such a variety of signals , overlapping in both the time and frequency domains ( to the point of creating _ confusion noise _ at some frequencies ) poses a number of interesting new challenges for gw data analysis , whose solution is essential if we are to draw the greatest possible science payoff from such a bold and innovative observatory .    at the end of 2005 ,",
    "the lisa international science team ( list ) initiated a programme of mock lisa data challenges ( mldcs ) with the goal of understanding at the conceptual and quantitative level the peculiarities of lisa data analysis , of demonstrating lisa s observational capabilities , and of kickstarting the development of data - analysis algorithms , pipelines , and infrastructural elements .",
    "an mldc task force , chartered by the list , periodically issues _ challenge _",
    "data sets containing gw signals from sources of undisclosed parameters , embedded in synthetic lisa noise ; challenge participants have a few months to analyze the data and submit detection candidates , which are then compared with the sources originally injected in the data sets .",
    "( _ training _ data sets with public source parameters are also provided to help participants tune and troubleshoot their codes . )",
    "three rounds of mldcs had been completed at the time of this workshop , each spanning approximately six months .",
    "challenge 1 @xcite was focused on establishing basic techniques to observe gws from compact galactic binaries , intrinsically monochromatic , isolated or moderately interfering ; as well as from the inspiral phase of bright , isolated , nonspinning massive  black - hole ( mbh ) binaries .",
    "challenge 2 @xcite featured three considerably more complex data - analysis problems : a data set containing gw signals from approximately 26 million galactic binaries ( again monochromatic ) drawn from a randomized population - synthesis catalog ; a data set ( the `` whole enchilada '' ) with a similar galactic - binary population , plus gw signals from an unknown number ( between 4 and 6 ) of nonspinning - mbh binary and from five extreme  mass - ratio inspirals ( emri ) ; and five more data sets with single - emri signals .",
    "the very steep increase in complexity introduced over a short time - scale with challenge 2 and the need to consolidate analysis techniques ( especially so for emris ) before moving to even more taxing challenges motivated the organization of challenge 1b , a repeat of challenge 1 with the addition of single - emri data sets .",
    "challenge-1b data sets were distributed in the late summer 2007 , with a deadline of december 2007 for entries .",
    "ten collaborations submitted solutions .",
    "highlights from this round include the range of techniques used , the participation of a number of new groups that successfully recovered signals from galactic binaries and mbh binaries , and the first convincing demonstration of emri detection _ and _",
    ". section [ s : challenge-1b ] provides a brief summary of the entries ; additional details about the work of individual collaborations are given elsewhere in this volume .    as we write",
    "( april 2008 ) , challenge-3 data sets have just been released , with entries due at the beginning of december 2008 .",
    "challenge 3 represents a definite step in the direction of more realistic source models ( such as chirping galactic binaries and spinning - mbh binaries ) and of new source classes ( such as short - lived bursts and stochastic backgrounds ) .",
    "section [ s : challenge-3 ] describes the challenge-3 data sets and waveform models in detail .",
    "challenge 1b focused on three classes of gw sources , each tackled in a separate subchallenge : monochromatic galactic binaries , mbh binaries and emris .",
    "the galactic - binary data sets ( 1b.1.1a  c and 1b.1.25 ) and the mbh - binary data sets ( 1b.2.12 ) had a duration of approximately one year ( 31457280 s , sampled at intervals of 15 s ) , while the emri data sets ( 1b.3.15 ) were twice as long ( with the same sampling time ) .",
    "the challenge solutions submitted by the participants were assessed with the simple criteria adopted in previous rounds @xcite .",
    "detector - response data were generated with the _ best - fit _ source parameters @xmath2 submitted by the participants , using the same code previously employed to build the challenge data sets .",
    "these data were then compared to the detector response to the _ true _",
    "waveforms , using as a figure of merit the _ recovered _ snr @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote time series for the noise - orthogonal tdi observables @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 denotes the usual signal product weighted by instrument noise .",
    "we also quote the _ correlation _",
    "@xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the _ optimal _ snr . for a perfect detection @xmath11 , but fluctuations @xmath12 are expected because of instrument noise .",
    "when we examine parameter errors , these are defined simply as @xmath13 ; in some cases it makes sense to consider the _ fractional _ parameter errors @xmath14 . in the rest of this section",
    "we briefly discuss the entries submitted by participants ; the technical notes accompanying the entries can be found at www.tapir.caltech.edu/~mldc/results1b/results.html .",
    "data sets 1b.1.1a  c and 1b.1.25 contained gw signals from monochromatic galactic binaries , in a variety of parameter ranges and source combinations .",
    "seven parameters are required to fully characterize each such source : the amplitude @xmath15 , the ( constant ) frequency @xmath16 , the ecliptic latitude and longitude @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the inclination and polarization angles @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and the initial phase @xmath21 .",
    "entries were submitted by five groups : * gsfc * ( scientists at goddard space flight center ) ; * impan * ( the institute of mathematics of the polish academy of science and the institute of theoretical physics at the university of wrocaw ) ; * aei * ( the albert einstein institute in golm , germany ) ; * mcmnju * ( the institute of applied mathematics of the chinese academy of sciences and the department of astronomy of nanjing university ) ; * uibbham * ( the university of the balearic islands and the university of birmingham ) .",
    "however , all groups except aei concentrated only on a subset of the challenges .",

    "the package includes a levenberg ",
    "marquardt optimization algorithm , which was used to obtain an initial guess for the source parameters .",
    "a markov - chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) routine , also available in xspec , was then used to converge to the best - fit source parameters .",

    "two groups submitted entries : * jpl * ( a collaboration between researchers at caltech and at the jet propulsion laboratory ) employed a three - step hierarchical strategy combining a time ",
    "frequency track - search analysis , a template - bank matched - filtering search , and a final mcmc stage to evaluate the posterior probability densities of source parameters for data sets 1b.2.1 and 1b.2.2 . * cardiff * ( a collaboration based at that university ) used a stochastic  template - bank matched - filtering search @xcite to analyze data set 1b.2.1 .",
    "table [ mbh ] summarizes these entries . while the recovered snrs are very close to @xmath110 , which indicates detections of very high confidence , there are large discrepancies in the sky - position angles for challenge 1b.2.1 , where both the * jpl * and * cardiff * searches converged on secondary likelihood maxima , very close in height to the true mode ( as shown by the recovered snr ) , but quite distant in parameter space .",
    "in fact , the * jpl * result places the source almost at the antipodal sky position , even if @xmath113 to better than one part in a thousand .    this is a true global degeneracy , which does not appear in local fisher - matrix analyses ( another example of why mock - data endeavors are useful ! ) , and which may indicate the need , in em searches of counterparts to lisa binary - mbh detections , to examine unconnected regions of the sky",
    ". it may however be premature to make such an inference , since the degeneracy could be broken by spin effects ( now included in challenge-3 waveforms ) and higher waveform harmonics .",
    "in addition , em - counterpart searches would require a data - analysis system capable of determining the sky position of mbh binaries a few days in advance of their merger ( corresponding to the interval between data dumps from lisa to the ground ) , whereas data set 1b.2.1 included the inspiral waveform all the way to the approximate merger frequency .",
    "therefore this challenge was _ not _ aimed directly at establishing the feasibility of sky - position determination for em - counterpart searches . in this context , it is however worth pointing out that the entries provided very accurate determinations of the times of coalescence , corresponding to time windows of a few minutes ( for challenge 1b.2.1 ) and about 45 minutes ( for 1b.2.2 ) .",
    "if we can compare the errors of table 4 with the parameter - determination accuracies predicted in the fisher - matrix formalism , we see that the * jpl * estimates for @xmath101 and @xmath102 fall within the 2-@xmath29 contour for data set 1b.2.1 ( notwithstanding the problem with sky position ) , and near the 1-@xmath29 contour for 1b.2.2 . for data set 1b.2.2 , * jpl * s @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 , are also close to 1-@xmath29 , and @xmath118 is @xmath119 ; the errors in @xmath19 and @xmath20 are all tens of @xmath29s ( but the fisher - matrix formalism is not always reliable for extrinsic parameters ) .",
    "altogether , we conclude that the * jpl * search essentially achieves the theoretical limits of parameter extraction for data set 1b.2.2 , while it does so for an important subset of parameters for data set 1b.2.1 .",

    "<S> the mock lisa data challenges are a programme to demonstrate and encourage the development of lisa data - analysis capabilities , tools and techniques . at the time of this workshop </S>",
    "<S> , three rounds of challenges had been completed , and the next was about to start . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we provide a critical analysis of entries to the latest completed round , challenge 1b . </S>",
    "<S> the entries confirm the consolidation of a range of data - analysis techniques for galactic and massive  black - hole binaries , and they include the first convincing examples of detection and parameter estimation of extreme  mass - ratio inspiral sources . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we also introduce the next round , challenge 3 . </S>",
    "<S> its data sets feature more realistic waveform models ( e.g. , galactic binaries may now chirp , and massive  black - hole binaries may precess due to spin interactions ) , as well as new source classes ( bursts from cosmic strings , isotropic stochastic backgrounds ) and more complicated nonsymmetric instrument noise . </S>"
