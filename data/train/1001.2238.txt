    "bottomonium ( @xmath5 ) is the preferred system for the study of the @xmath6 interaction .",
    "theoretical calculations for bottomonium are generally more reliable than for other @xmath6 systems due to the small relativistic corrections ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "however , much about the spectrum of bottomonium states remains unknown .",
    "although potential models predict @xmath8 bottomonium states to lie below the @xmath9 threshold ( as illustrated in fig .  1 ) , only 10 of them had been identified since the discovery of bottomonium in 1977  @xcite until 2008 .",
    "most importantly , the ground state @xmath10 , had not been identified , despite many searches by cusb  @xcite and cleo  @xcite at cesr , and alpeh  @xcite and delphi  @xcite at lep , among others .",
    "this situation changed in july 2008 , when the babar collaboration announced the discovery of @xmath11 in their data for 109  million  @xmath12  @xcite in the radiative decay @xmath13 , with a significance of @xmath14 , as illustrated in fig .  2 .",
    "we note that the small peak at @xmath15  mev due to the radiative transition to @xmath11 is not visible until the large smooth background is subtracted .",
    "babar s success is due not simply due to their large data set , more than an order of magnitude larger than previously collected at cleo , but also due a factor 3 greater background suppression by the use of a cut on the `` thrust angle '' .",
    "the thrust angle is defined as the angle between the signal transition photon candidate and the thrust axis of the rest of the event  @xcite .",
    "babar s discovery of @xmath16 is exciting and like all such claims , needs to be confirmed by an independent experiment .",
    "we report on such a measurement at cleo .    )",

    "at cleo we have an 18 times smaller data set than babar ( 5.9 m compared to 109 m ) , so several improvements in analysis procedure were needed in order to identify the @xmath16 signal .",
    "the three main improvements were : performing a detailed study of the background parameterization ; obtaining accurate parameterizations of the photon peak line shapes ; and using the power of the thrust angle to separate signal and background to perform a joint analysis of the full data in three bins of the thrust angle .    in fig .  2",
    ", we show the inclusive energy spectra for isolated electromagnetic showers in cleo @xmath12 and @xmath20 data , after contributions from @xmath21 have been rejected .",
    "three features are immediately visible from these spectra .",
    "one , the spectra are dominated by a larger , smoothly varying background from other bottomonium decays and decays from @xmath22lighter  hadrons .",
    "two , the visible peaks come from the unresolved transitions @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "lastly , the peaks from @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( with @xmath27  mev for @xmath20 and @xmath28  mev for @xmath12 ) are expected to be more than an order of magnitude weaker than the @xmath29 peaks , and they reside on the high energy tails of @xmath29 .    * photon line shapes : * photon line shapes in crystal calorimeters , like those used by cleo , are generally parameterized in terms of the crystal ball function .",
    "this function combines a gaussian ( width @xmath30 ) , with a low - energy power law tail ( parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) . knowing the shape of the low energy tail is especially important for the @xmath18 peaks , since they are important in determing the shape of the background at the energy of the small @xmath16 signal .",
    "these parameters must be determined by fitting a background - free photon peak . in our analysis",
    "we use two independent methods . in one method",
    ", we use the observed shape of photons from a given energy from radiative bhabha events , and in the other we use the shape of photons from the excusive decays @xmath33 . both methods give consistent results , and once the parameters are determined , they are fixed in subsequent analyses .",

    "* background * : we find that fitting the smooth background is the most crucial component in determing the results for the weak @xmath16 peak .",
    "we made several hundred background fits to the data in each of three bins of @xmath36 , using exponential polynomials of various orders ( 2,3,4 ) , in various energy regions ( 5001340  mev ) , and with linear and logarithmic binning of the data .",
    "we found that many of these fit the data acceptably , and took as our final results the average of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and significance for all the good fits ( cl@xmath39 ) .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "variation of these fits was then taken as a measure of the systematic uncertainty in the results from this source , @xmath40  mev in @xmath41 , @xmath42 in @xmath43 , and @xmath44 in significance .    *",
    "joint analysis in three bins of @xmath36 * : as fig .",
    "4  ( left ) shows , the distribution of thrust angle ( @xmath36 ) for the background - dominated data is strongly peaked in the forward direction , but for the transition photon to the @xmath16 , the distribution is expected to be uniform .",
    "this happens because the transition photon is uncorrelated with the particles produced by the decay of the @xmath16 , whereas the background photons tend to be correlated with the other particles produced in the underlying event .",
    "we therefore define three different regions of @xmath36 : region  i ( @xmath45 ) , region  ii ( @xmath46 ) , and region  iii ( @xmath47 ) ) .",
    "4  ( right ) illustrates the different levels of signal and background in the three regions .    unlike babar",
    ", we do not reject events in the @xmath48 region .",
    "instead , we simultaneously fit the spectra for each of the three regions , which lets each region contribute to the total result weighted by its individual signal - to - background .",
    "we call this method the `` joint fit '' .",
    "we have analyzed our data by the joint fit method , and also with @xmath49 , for comparison with babar s method .",
    "we find that the joint fit method enhances the significance of the @xmath16 identification by @xmath50 .",
