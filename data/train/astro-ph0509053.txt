    "on 1999 july 23 00:31 edt ( 1999:204:04:31 utc ) , after attempts the evenings of july 19 and july 21 , the space shuttle _ columbia _",
    "mission sts-93 launched from nasa s kennedy space center .",
    "a little over 7 hours later , _ columbia _ deployed the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. ( for a detailed description of the observatory and its instruments see e.g. weisskopf et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and references therein . ) about an hour thereafter , two firings of the attached solid - rocket inertial upper stage and subsequent separation sent _ chandra _  toward a high elliptical orbit .",
    "five burns of _ chandra _ s integral propulsion system  on july 24 , 25 , and 27 and august 4 and 7placed the _ chandra x - ray observatory _  into its operational orbit , with initial apogee and perigee altitudes of 140 mm and 10 mm , respectively .    during the orbital - transfer period ,",
    "the science - instrument teams activated and began functional checks of the high - resolution camera ( hrc ) and of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) .",
    "also during this period ( on july 26 ) , bake - out of the acis began , with its door to the optical cavity of the telescope still closed so that any molecular contamination would vent to space .",
    "after approximately two weeks ( on august 8) , the _ chandra _  operations control center ( occ ) commanded open the acis door .",
    "then , on 1999 august 12 , the occ commanded open the telescope s ( forward contamination cover ) sunshade door , the last barrier between the _ chandra _  focal plane and the x - ray sky .    when the sunshade door opened , the attitude control system was not yet in its normal operating mode .",
    "although the aspect camera was acquiring data , it was not yet an active part of the attitude control system .",
    "rather , the _ chandra _ gyroscopes , which have very small drift , were controlling the spacecraft s attitude .",
    "further , the dither mode , which moves the image around in a small focal - plane region ( to avoid focusing onto a single pixel ) was not yet active .",
    "consequently , the pointing was already very stable , even without aspect - camera data . however , the absolute pointing was uncertain by up to 10 degrees , because the fine attitude of the spacecraft had not yet been established .",
    "as _ chandra _ s first celestial x rays reflected off its precision mirrors , the acis - s ( spectroscopy array ) lay in the focal position , with the telescope s aim point on ccd s3one of two back - illuminated devices of the 10 ccds comprising the acis focal plane .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "science team had selected this as the at - launch configuration , in case the translation table failed to operate .",
    "likewise , the at - launch configuration of the focus mechanism placed s3 near best focus , based upon x - ray testing at msfc s x - ray calibration facility ( xrcf ) .    with x rays falling onto the active acis detector ,",
    "the _ chandra _  science team obtained the observatory s first image  a 9-ks observation using acis ccds s2 , s3 , i0 , i1 , i2 , and i3 .",
    "it is impossible to convey the excitement and tension that accompanied this observation , as the image of the first photons appeared on a display at the occ .",
    "the _ chandra _  project , which had its formal origins in an unsolicited 1976 proposal ( riccardo giacconi , principal investigator ; harvey tananbaum , co - principal investigator ) to nasa , was 23 years in the making .",
    "everyone present at the occ keenly felt the exhilaration of witnessing these efforts come to fruition .",
    "after several minutes , the accumulated acis image ( figure  [ f : s3-image ] ) showed a few photons concentrated within a few arcseconds of each other , not too far ( about 5 arcminutes ) from the optical axis .",
    "this immediately demonstrated that _",
    "s mirrors were performing as expected and that the telescope was not far from best focus .",
    "the clustering of photons was from the brightest source in _ chandra _",
    "s first field . to acknowledge the enormous contributions to _ chandra _  by the telescope scientist",
    "leon van speybroeck , the project scientist ( mcw ) dubbed this first source `` leon x-1 '' .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "team next pointed the observatory toward the radio - loud quasar pks 0637 - 752 ( @xmath2 ) , selected for on - orbit check - out and imaging optimization .",
    "after bore - sighting and focusing the telescope , the _ chandra _  acis obtained the first publicly released image on august 15 , showing the discovery of an x - ray jet in this quasar ( schwartz et al .",
    "2000 ) . on august 19 , _",
    "chandra _  obtained the _ official _",
    "`` first - light '' image ( released on august 26 ; tananbaum ( 1999 ) ; pavlov et al .",
    "( 2000))a spectacular view of the supernova remnant cassiopeia a ( cas a ) , revealing a central , candidate neutron star .    here",
    "we present an analysis of those data obtained during the true `` first light''the image of the first _",
    "chandra _",
    "field and its brightest source , `` leon x-1 '' .",
    "first (  [ s : obs ] ) we describe the _ chandra _  observation and analyses of the x - ray data .",
    "next (  [ s : vis_sp ] ) we present and discuss visible - light spectroscopy of `` leon x-1 '' obtained at the european southern observatory .",
    "we conclude (  [ s : agn_prop ] ) with a discussion of the multi - wavelength properties of `` leon x-1 '' in the context of the e1 correlation space for active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "the first _ chandra _ observation ( obsid 62568 ) lasted 9 ks and used acis ccds s2 , s3 , i0 , i1 , i2 , i3 in the timed - exposure mode , with the standard 3.241-s frame time . during the observation , the aspect camera tracked 6 stars that it had acquired during a full - field search .",
    "this was unique in that the aspect stars were selected autonomously , rather than by ground command .",
    "in addition , the initial on - board attitude estimate differed by approximately 7 degrees from the true attitude .",
    "consequently , we prepared special input files for a custom run of the aspect data - processing pipeline to produce an aspect solution .",
    "this solution showed that the observatory was pointed at approximately @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "however , this position was still uncertain by several arcseconds because the observation was performed without tracking the aspect fiducial lights , which enable precise registration of the science - instrument focal plane relative to the telescope boresight .",
    "hence , we fine - tuned the aspect solution (  [ s : analysis_i ] ) using accurately known positions of optical counterparts obviously identified with x - ray sources in the field .",
    "chandra _",
    "x - ray center ( cxc ) processing ( cxcds 6.2.4 ) to create level-2 event lists . for finding x - ray sources , we selected events in pulse - invariant ( pi ) channels corresponding to 0.58.0@xmath5 for the front - illuminated ccds ( s2 , i0i3 ) , and to 0.258.0@xmath5 for the back - illuminated ccd ( s3 ) . due to uncertainties in the low - energy response",
    ", we used only data in the range 0.58.0@xmath5 for the spectral analyses . during the observation",
    ", there were no instances of increased background .",
    "following a discussion (  [ s : analysis_i ] ) of our analysis of the x - ray image , we describe (  [ s : analysis_s ] ) the results of x - ray spectrometry of these sources and then summarize (  [ s : xray_desc ] ) their x - ray properties .",
    "we employed source - finding techniques described in swartz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , with a circular - gaussian approximation to the point spread function and a minimum signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of 2.6 , resulting in much fewer than one expected accidental detection in the field .",
    "the corresponding background - subtracted point - source detection limit is about 10 counts , corresponding to a 0.58.0-@xmath5 flux of about @xmath6 erg  @xmath7  s@xmath8  for an unabsorbed power law of photon index @xmath9 .",
    "the algorithm found 15 sources1 on s2 , 10 on s3 ( figure  [ f : s3-image ] ) , and 4 on the ( 4-ccd ) i array . that most of the detected sources were on s3",
    "is not surprising , in that this ( back - illuminated ) ccd included the aim point and also has the deepest sensitivity of the acis ccds because of its superior low - energy response .",
    "after detection of the sources , we immediately noticed a systematic offset of about 5  between several of the x - ray sources and their respective candidate visible - light counterparts in the united states naval observatory catalog usno - b1.0 ( monet et al .",
    "2003 ; hereafter , usno - b1 ) , one being a @xmath10-magnitude star also detected with the aspect camera . in order to fine tune the aspect solution",
    ", we minimized the separation between the x - ray and visible - light positions (  [ s : counterparts ] ) using a position - error - weighted least - squares fit , treating the right ascension , declination , and roll angle of the pointing position as free parameters .",
    "for the visible - light positions , we adopted uncertainties from the usno - b1 catalog . for the x - ray positions , we used uncertainties given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 determines the size of the circular gaussian that approximates the point spread function at the source location , @xmath13 is the aperture - corrected number of source counts , @xmath14 is a systematic error , and the factor 1.51 scales the radius to enclose 68% of the circular gaussian . for various values of @xmath14 ranging from @xmath15 to @xmath16 , we allowed @xmath17ra , @xmath17dec , and @xmath17roll to vary freely .",
    "once we applied the resulting offsets to the initial x - ray positions , all fits were excellent , independent of the choice for @xmath14 .",
    "uncertainties in the plate scale imply a systematic uncertainty of @xmath18 .",
    "given that , where relevant , the usno and _ chandra _  positions agree to high precision , we believe that @xmath19 is a reasonable and conservative estimate for @xmath14 .",
    "we note that the precise value of @xmath14 has no statistically significant impact on the positions of the x - ray sources .",

    "the field s brightest x - ray source , s3 - 5 , is the source we nicknamed `` leon x-1 '' .",
    "table  [ t : xsources ] also gives the x - ray flux and the separation between each x - ray source and any candidate counterpart (  [ s : counterparts ] ) in the usno - b1 or in the two - micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) .",
    "using the heasarc cfeature , we searched available catalogs for candidate counterparts centered on the x - ray positions listed in table  [ t : xsources ] .",
    "we selected non - x - ray candidate counterparts by searching around the x - ray position within a 99%-confidence radius ( @xmath20 , 3.03/1.51 times the x - ray positional uncertainty @xmath21 listed in column 6 of table  [ t : xsources ] ) .",
    "although approximating the point - spread function by a circular gaussian becomes less accurate far off - axis , use of this approximation has virtually no impact on the coordinates of the x - ray sources .",

    "the higher temperature component accounted for 82% of the flux , accounting for the absence of lines and similarity to a thermal - bremsstrahlung model .",
    "as with the power - law fit , the two - temperature mekal fit requires negligible interstellar absorption@xmath44 , for four interesting parameters .      the next brightest source  s3 - 10had only about 160 counts , which we grouped into spectral bins of at least 15 counts each . with @xmath45 on 4 degrees of freedom , a power - law fit was marginally unacceptable at 95% confidence .",
    "blackbody and mekal models each yielded an acceptable fit , but with very different values for all parameters ( table  [ t : spectra ] ) except the flux .      the remaining 13 _ chandra _  sources had fewer than 100 detected source counts each ; thus , we attempted no spectral fitting for them individually .",

    "chandra _  field . for a sky density of about 2 such sources per square degree ( kim et al .",
    "2004 ) , it was somewhat fortuitous that so bright a source lay in the initial field of view ( 0.12 deg@xmath48 ) and on ccd s3 ( 0.02 deg@xmath48 ) .",
    "we have identified this x - ray source with a 17@xmath49 b - magnitude type-1 agn at redshift @xmath0 (  [ s : vis_sp_res ] ) . based upon its x - ray spectrum (  [ s : sp_s3 - 5 ] ,",

    "during the _ chandra _  exposure , the inferred _ rosat _  flux was consistent with that of 1rxs j051934.0 - 604800 (  [ s : other_x - ray ] ) in the _ rosat _  all - sky survey bright - source catalog .",
    "thus , the _ chandra _  and _ rosat _  sources are almost certainly the same object .",
    "the counterpart to s3 - 10 appears to be a @xmath10-magnitude ( a3-v ) early main sequence star (  [ s : counterparts ] ) .",
    "however , it is unlikely that an early a star is the source of x rays ( e.g. , simon , drake & kim 1995 ; schmitt 1997 ; daniel , linsky & gagne 2002 ) : such stars are too hot to drive convectively a corona ( as for g , k , m stars ) but too cool to drive a stellar wind ( as for o and early b stars ) .",
    "thus , if the bright a star is not obscuring an unrelated object , the observed x - ray emission probably comes from a binary companion to the a star . in this scenario ,",
    "the soft x - ray spectrum suggests that the system is not a close binary , which would effect a high stellar rotational frequency and hard - x - ray emission .      the near - infrared magnitudes and colors ( figure  [ f:2mass_colors ] and table  [ t:2mass_colors ] ) of the 2mass candidate counterpart to source s3 - 9 are quite similar to those of source s3 - 5 (  [ s : s3 - 5 ] ) , which we identified as a type-1 agn (  [ s : vis_sp_res ] ) .",

    "these colors are indicative of a moderately large absorption column .",

    "thus , they may be obscured agns .",
    "source s3 - 2 is the second faintest x - ray source detected on ccd s3 ; thus its x - ray colors have rather large errors .",
    "if the x - ray colors ( figure  [ f : s3_xcolors ] ) are correct , its spectrum is much harder than any other source on s3 , possibly indicating a very high absorption column .",
    "this and the absence of either a usno or 2mass candidate counterpart are consistent with a highly obscured agn .",
    "the remaining sources detected on ccd s3 have x - ray colors ( figure  [ f : s3_xcolors ] ) similar to those of s3 - 5 and s3 - 9 .",
    "thus , it is tempting to argue that these x - ray sources are also ( unobscured ) type-1 agns . based upon the large number of agns observable with _ chandra _  ( e.g. , kim et al .  2004 )",
    ", this conclusion is reasonable .",
    "using spectrographs of the european southern observatory ( eso ) at la silla ( chile ) , we obtained visible - light spectroscopy of the candidate counterpart to the field s brightest x - ray source ( s3 - 5 , `` leon x-1 '' ) .",

    "typical agn lines that are not detected in `` leon x-1 '' include 6300 and 4067 .",
    "there is slight evidence for weak 6583 , but the fit is not well constrained because of its superposition over the broad and bright wing of .",

    "thus , their relative proximity to the nucleus would result in higher velocities and ionization parameters relative to the those of the narrow - line regions .",
    "however , such seyfert galaxies usually display significant line - profile asymmetries toward the blue , implying both outflow and extinction of emission from the far hemisphere of the agn .",
    "in contrast , most line profiles for leon x-1 are symmetric , with only 4959,5007 showing a weak asymmetry (  [ s : vis_fits ] ) .",
    "this argues against a spherically - symmetric outflow ( e.g. , appenzeller & streicher 1988 ) , but would be consistent with bipolar ejection , if radiation from receding material is suppressed  e.g .",

    ", due to line blending and calibration errors  might raise this ratio to about 2.0 , still significantly below the canonical value for a tenuous photoionized plasma .",
    "furthermore , this ratio ( /  @xmath63 ) is unusually small compared to that found in other agns ( e.g. , vaughan et al .",
    "reddening , of course , can only steepen the decrement and thus can not account for so low an /  ratio .",
    "other effects  self - absorption in the balmer lines , collisional excitation and de - excitation , stimulated emission , etc.can also alter the balmer decrement ( osterbrock , capriotti & bautz 1963 ; capriotti 1964 ; cox & mathews 1969 ; gerola , salem & panagia 1971 ; parker 1964 ; adams & petrosian 1974 ; netzer 1975 , 1977 ; krolik & mckee 1978 ; ferland & rees 1988 ; rees , netzer & ferland ; zheng & puetter 1990 ) .",
    "these studies ( especially krolik & mckee 1978 ; drake & ulrich 1980 ; zheng & puetter 1990 ) indicate that the most favorable conditions for producing a flat balmer decrement are non - negligible optical depths in  and high densities , which increase collisional de - excitation , driving the hydrogen - level population toward local thermodynamic equilibrium . in the extreme",
    ", these conditions produce a very flat balmer decrement , as observed in the spectra of cataclysmic - variable accretion disks ( williams 1983 ; elitzur et al .  1983 ;",
    "williams & shipman 1988 )    consequently , the broad - line balmer decrement observed in leon x-1 suggests emission from dense photoionized gas in which collisional de - excitation is non - negligible . while the emitting gas could be in cloudlets circulating in the inner region of the agn",
    ", it could also comprise the photosurface of an accretion disk ( see also collin - souffrin et al .  1981 ; collin - souffrin , dumont & tully 1982 ) . if we accept the large black - hole mass and high accretion rate inferred from our analysis below (  [ s : agn_prop ] ) , this broad - line emitting gas may reside in the distal region of the accretion disk that fuels the uv / x radiation from black holes .",
    "analyses of multi - wavelength parameters of agns show correlations amongst widths and strengths of , 5007 , and  optical emission lines , and soft - x - ray photon index . a remarkable feature of the `` eigenvector 1 '' ( e1 ) correlation space in a principal - component analysis ( boroson & green 1992 , hereafter bg92 ; wang , brinkman & bergeron 1996 ; sulentic et al .",
