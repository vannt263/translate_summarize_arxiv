    "<S> 3a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the net interference effect ( after integrating over the chosen interval ) is destructive beyond @xmath62 for comparison , the dashed line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 illustrates the inevitable fractional excess if one ( incorrectly ) combines the signal and background processes incoherently . </S>",
    "<S> the change of slope in both curves at @xmath63 is due to the @xmath64 threshold in the higgs boson width .    </S>",
    "<S> we can go beyond the qualitative nature of fig .  4 by considering the statistical significance of a higgs boson signal in the @xmath65 channel . </S>",
    "<S> if we wish to employ a simple @xmath66 measure of statistical significance , it would clearly be unwise to restrict our attention to @xmath50 defined over a @xmath15 bin centered on @xmath29 as we did for fig .  4 since such bins potentially encompass regions of both constructive and destructive interference . </S>",
    "<S> however , for a fixed binwidth one can optimize the position of the bin center to maximize @xmath67 though such an optimization is statistically illegal ( unless one compensates for the reduction in the number of degrees of freedom ) we will nevertheless use this technique to place an upper limit on the significance attainable .    with the binwidth chosen as @xmath68 the solid curve in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> 5 gives the value of @xmath70 obtained in the spirit of previous analyses which a ) neglect interference effects b ) assume experimental resolution effects are accounted for solely by the binwidth ( i.e. , they impose no gaussian smearing ) and c ) center the bins on @xmath59 because of these differences the curves in fig .  5 are not directly comparable : the dashed curve is included only for reference to previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> as in fig .  4 , there is a change in slope of the curves in fig .  5 at @xmath71 due to an abrupt change in the higgs boson decay width ( neglecting threshold effects ) .    </S>",
    "<S> our motivation for pursuing the issue of interference effects in @xmath72 was the possibility that significant interference , if present , could brighten the prospects for exploiting the @xmath2 mode for detecting a higgs boson with @xmath9 at a backscattered laser facility . </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that the relevant interference terms can indeed be large and that for @xmath1 they result in a net destructive interference which not only negates the contributions from an incoherent signal ( i.e. , from the square of the loop amplitudes ) but also produces a net resonant dip in the corresponding @xmath15 spectrum : this is the central result of this letter . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the statistical significance of the resonant dip is not encouraging ( at least in the experimental arrangement considered ) and thus the @xmath2 mode for @xmath73 remains elusive even though the underlying nature of the signal is significantly altered .    </S>",
