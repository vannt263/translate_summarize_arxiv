    "the recent complete dna sequences of many organisms are available to systematically search of genome structure . for the large amount of dna sequences ,",
    "developing methods for extracting meaningful information is a major challenge for bioinformatics . to understand the one - dimensional symbolic sequences composed of the four letters ` a ' , ` c ' , ` g ' and ` t ' ( or ` u ' ) , some statistical and geometrical methods were developed@xcite . in special , chaos game representation ( cgr)@xcite , which generates a two - dimensional square from a one - dimensional sequence , provides a technique to visualize the composition of dna sequences .",
    "the characteristics of cgr images was described as genomic signature , and classification of species in the whole bacteria genome was analyzed by making an euclidean metric between two cgr images@xcite . based on the genomic signature ,",
    "the distance between two dna sequences depending on the length of nucleotide strings was presented@xcite and the horizontal transfers in prokaryotes and eukaryotes were detected and charaterized@xcite .",
    "recently , a one - to - one metric representation of the dna sequences@xcite , which was borrowed from the symbolic dynamics , makes an ordering of subsequences in a plane .",
    "suppression of certain nucleotide strings in the dna sequences leads to a self - similarity of pattern seen in the metric representation of dna sequences .",
    "self - similarity limits of genomic signatures were determined as an optimal string length for generating the genomic signatures@xcite . moreover , by using the metric representation method , the recurrence plot technique of dna sequences was established and employed to analyze correlation structure of nucleotide strings@xcite .    as a eukaryotic organism ,",
    "yeast is one of the premier industrial microorganisms , because of its essential role in brewing , baking , and fuel alcohol production .",
    "in addition , yeast has proven to be an excellent model organism for the study of a variety of biological problems involving the fields of genetics , molecular biology , cell biology and other disciplines within the biomedical and life sciences . in april 1996",
    ", the complete dna sequence of the yeast ( saccharomyces cevevisiae ) genome , consisting of 16 chromosomes with 12 million basepairs , had been released to provide a resource of genome information of a single organism .",
    "however , only 43.3% of all 6000 predicted genes in the saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast were functionally characterized when the complete sequence of the yeast genome became available@xcite .",
    "moreover , it was found that dna transposable elements have ability to move from place to place and make many copies within the genome via the transposition@xcite .",
    "therefore , the yeast complete dna sequence remain a topic to be studied respect to its genome architecture structure in the whole sequence .    in this paper , using the metric representation and recurrence plot methods , we analyze global transposable characteristics in the yeast complete dna sequence , i.e. , 16 chromosome sequences .",
    "for a given dna sequence @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) , a plane metric representation is generated by making the correspondence of symbol @xmath2 to number @xmath3 or @xmath4 and calculating values ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) of all subsequences @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) defined as follows @xmath9 where @xmath3 is 0 if @xmath10 or 1 if @xmath11 and @xmath12 is 0 if @xmath13 or 1 if @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the one - dimensional symbolic sequence is partitioned into @xmath15 subsequences @xmath16 and mapped in the two - dimensional plane ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "subsequences with the same ending @xmath18-nucleotide string , which are labeled by @xmath19 , correspond to points in the zone encoded by the @xmath18-nucleotide string . taking a subsequence @xmath20 , we calculate @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the heaviside function [ @xmath23 , if @xmath24 ; @xmath25 , if @xmath26 and @xmath27 is a subsequence ( @xmath28 ) . when @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath30 , a point @xmath31 is plotted in a plane .",
    "thus , repeating the above process from the beginning of one - dimensional symbolic sequence and shifting forward , we obtain a recurrence plot of the dna sequence .    for presenting correlation structure in the recurrence plot plane ,",
    "a correlation intensity is defined at a given correlation distance @xmath32 @xmath33 the quantity displays the transference of @xmath18-nucleotide strings in the dna sequence . to further determine positions and lengths of the transposable elements , we analyze the recurrent plot plane .",
    "since @xmath34 and @xmath27 @xmath35 , the transposable element has the length @xmath18 at least . from the recurrence plot plane",
    ", we calculate the maximal value of @xmath36 to satisfy @xmath37 i.e. , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
