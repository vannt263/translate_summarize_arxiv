    "whether protons or electrons dominate particle acceleration and non - thermal energy transport in solar flares is still subject of recent debate [ e.g. see _ great debate _ articles by cargill ( 1996 ) , simnett ( 1996 ) , and emslie ( 1996 ) ] .",
    "moreover , proponents of proton - dominated models argue that even the @xmath4 kev hxr bremsstrahlung is produced either by protons directly ( heristchi 1986 ; 1987 ) or by proton - energized electrons ( simnett & haines 1990 )",
    ". the purpose of this _ letter _ is to complement these ongoing debates with powerful new arguments that are supported by observations of energy - dependent hard x - ray ( hxr ) timing delays in solar flares .",
    "electrons have been favored for the interpretation of impulsive @xmath4 kev hxrs because the inversion of the hxr spectrum ( brown 1971 ) in the framework of energy loss by collisional bremsstrahlung ( in a relatively cold target ) could easily reproduce : ( 1 ) an electron spectrum that contains the necessary and sufficient energy content to explain the non - thermal hxr emission , ( 2 ) the gyrosynchrotron emission observed at microwave wavelengths , and ( 3 ) the soft x - ray emission resulting from the heated , upflowing chromospheric plasma .",
    "more detailed arguments for the case of electron dominance in solar flare energy transport can be found in emslie ( 1996 ) , emslie et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and references therein .    protons , on the other hand , have been invoked as primary energy carriers ( simnett 1986 ; 1995 ) mainly because it minimizes the number of energy - carrying particles ( thanks to their intrinsically higher rest mass , i.e. @xmath5 ) , which in turn also minimizes return currents ( at least for high - energy protons with @xmath6 kev , see , e.g. , simnett & strong 1984 , emslie & brown 1985 ) .",
    "observational support for the proton hypothesis was mainly gathered by indirect effects , e.g. ( 1 ) acceleration mechanisms ( e.g. shocks ) can have greater efficiencies for protons because of their larger gyroradii , ( 2 ) the proton spectrum at energies @xmath7 mev could be considerably steeper than previously supposed ( ramaty et al .",
    "1995 ) , based on recent measurements of share & murphy ( 1995 ) , ( 3 ) detection of interplanetary high - energy ( @xmath8 mev ) protons ( evenson et al .",
    "1984 ) , etc .",
    "a discussion of arguments in favor of protons can be found in a recent review by simnett ( 1995 ) , and further arguments of proton versus electron beam models are discussed in brown et al .",
    "( 1990 ) .",
    "a new aspect that we would like to contribute to the electron - versus - proton debate is based on new timing results from hxr observations in solar flares , analyzed in a series of recent studies ( aschwanden , schwartz & alt 1995 ; aschwanden & schwartz 1995 ; 1996 ; aschwanden 1996 ; aschwanden et al . 1996a ; 1996b ; 1996c ) .",
    "the energy - dependent timing delays @xmath9 of fast ( @xmath0 s ) _ hxr pulses _ during the impulsive flare phase have been found to be consistent with electron time - of - flight differences , while the timing delays of the _ smooth hxr _ flux are comparable with electron trapping time scales . the interpretation of hard x - ray time structures in terms of these two components ( associated with directly - precipitating versus trapped particles ) is a basic assumption used in the following discussion , in contrast to the widely - held hypothesis that the lower envelope of the rapidly - varying hard x - ray flux consists of an unresolved pileup of elementary pulses with similar characteristics as the rapid fluctuations ( e.g. kiplinger et al .",
    "1983 , 1984 ; machado et al . 1993 ) .",
    "while protons have not been considered in our previous studies , we would like to explore in this _",
    "letter _ whether proton theories could be reconciled with the observed hxr timing delays , and what the required proton energies would be . because the timing delays of hxrs are directly related to the particle velocities",
    ", timing information provides a direct means of constraining the kinetic energy and rest mass of the involved particles .    in section ",
    "2 we compare theoretical electron and proton time - of - flight differences with the observed delays of fast _ hxr pulses_. in section ",
    "3 we discuss theoretical trapping times in solar flare loops and compare them with the observed delays of the _ smooth hxr _ emission . section",
    " 4 contains conclusions on the question of which species of particles is more likely to reproduce the observed hxr timing delays .",
    "both proponents of electron - dominated and proton - dominated flare models agree with the assumption that particles are accelerated in the coronal part of a flare loop and that the hxrs observed from the loop footpoints are produced by collisional bremsstrahlung in the chromosphere .",
    "the main difference between the two models is the question of the particle species that carries the energy from the acceleration site to the energy loss site . in the case of proton - dominated models , either the protons produce hxr s directly by inverse bremsstrahlung ( emslie & brown 1985 ; heristchi 1986 ; 1987 ) , or a neutral beam is assumed to precipitate to the chromosphere , where an electric field arising from charge separation accelerates hxr - emitting electrons ( simnett & haines 1990 ) . in the latter model , electrons are thought to be stripped by coulomb scattering from a neutralized ion beam as it impacts the chromosphere .",
    "this charge separation process may set up an electric field that is able to produce runaway acceleration of electrons responsible for the @xmath4 kev hxr bremsstrahlung .",
    "this model has been severely criticized by emslie ( 1996 ) .",
    "thus , the timing of the two models can be tested in first order by comparing the particle time - of - flight differences occurring during the propagation from the coronal acceleration site to the chromospheric energy loss site .",
    "if the energy - dependent timing delays of the hxrs is dominated by such propagation effects , the hxr emission produced by the low - energy particles should always be delayed with respect to the high - energy particles , because of their lower velocity .",
    "energy loss times and acceleration times seem not to dominate the timing delays of ( @xmath0 s ) hxr pulses in most of the flares , because they do not reproduce the correct sign in the energy - dependent timing delays ( aschwanden et al . 1996a ; aschwanden 1996 ) .",
    "thus , the time - of - flight difference @xmath10 between two particles @xmath11 and @xmath12 arriving at the chromospheric energy loss - site is determined by their velocities @xmath13 ( or @xmath14 ) and the path length @xmath15 , @xmath16 the relativistic velocity @xmath17 is defined by the kinetic energy @xmath18 of the particles and the lorentz factor @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath20^{-2}}\\ ] ] if we compare electrons with a kinetic energy @xmath21 and rest mass @xmath22 with protons of kinetic energy @xmath23 and rest mass @xmath24 , the velocity ratio is @xmath25^{-2 } } \\over        \\sqrt { 1 - [ { e_e \\over m_e c^2 } + 1]^{-2 } } }       \\approx \\sqrt { { e_p \\over e_e } \\cdot { m_e \\over m_p } }      = { 1 \\over 43 } \\sqrt{e_p \\over e_e } \\ , \\ ] ] where the right - hand approximation applies to the non - relativistic ( or mildly relativistic ) case .",
    "for instance , to obtain identical velocities for electrons and protons , the kinetic energy of the protons has to be a factor of @xmath26 larger , e.g. 40 mev protons have the same velocity as 20 kev electrons .    in the case of protons",
    ", it was proposed that flare hxrs could be produced by an `` inverse bremsstrahlung process '' ( boldt and serlemitsos 1969 ; emslie & brown 1985 ; heristchi 1986 ; 1987 ) .",
    "protons would produce hxr photons by collisional bremsstrahlung in collisional encounters with electrons .",
    "the relative velocity of a proton of energy @xmath27 in an encounter with an ambient electron is the same as that of an electron of energy @xmath21 in an encounter with a stationary proton .",
    "since @xmath8 mev protons have identical velocities as @xmath4 kev electrons , they would also show the same time - of - flight differences as observed .",
    "however , the major problem with @xmath8 mev protons is that the required proton flux to produce the observed @xmath4 kev hxr flux would exceed the proton flux deduced from nuclear gamma - ray line observations ( at 2 - 10 mev ) by a factor of @xmath28 ( ramaty 1985 ) .    to alleviate the problem of @xmath29 mev protons , simnett & haines ( 1990 ) proposed a neutral beam model , that requires only 0.1 - 1 mev protons to produce the observed @xmath4 kev hxr flux . after a neutral beam arrives at the chromosphere , hxr emission",
    "is produced by secondary electrons accelerated in the electric field that arises from the charge separation of penetrating ions and thermalized primary electrons .",
    "thus , the timing delays of hxr emission are mainly determined by the coronal propagation time of the 0.1 - 1 mev protons in the neutral beam .",
    "however , these lower proton energies correspond to velocities that would produce far greater time - of - flight differences than for 40 mev protons or 20 kev electrons . according to eq.3 , the velocity of 1 mev protons would be a factor of @xmath30 smaller than for 20 kev electrons , and thus , the time - of - flight differences would be 10 times larger than for 20 kev electrons or 40 mev protons .",
    "fig.1 shows typical hxr time delay measurements in the energy range of 40 - 300 kev for a major flare .",
    "the _ pulsed hxr _ flux ( fig.1 bottom right ) exhibits time delays of @xmath31 kev)@xmath32 ms .",
    "these delays show the correct sign as expected for particle time - of - flight differences , i.e. the lower energies lag the high energies .",
    "also the functional form of the energy - dependent time delay is consistent with the expected model ( eq.1 , thick line on right - hand side bottom in fig.1 ) , within a high accuracy of @xmath33 ms . for the conversion of electron energies",
    "@xmath34 into hxr photon energies @xmath35 , a conversion factor of @xmath36 was determined ( see second line on right - hand side from bottom in fig.1 , according to calculations in aschwanden & schwartz 1996 ) .",
    "moreover , the time - of - flight distance , i.e. @xmath37 km , is found to be close to a loop half length ( @xmath38 km ) , if electron velocities are employed .",
    "this ratio @xmath39 was established to be scale - invariant for a comprehensive set of loop sizes in different flares ( aschwanden et al .",
    "1996b , 1996c ) .",
    "if we employ protons to reproduce these observed hxr delays , we can either adjust the energy range or the time - of - flight distance .",
    "if we adjust the energy range , protons with energies of @xmath8 mev would be required to produce matching velocities .",
    "if we employ 1 mev protons , the velocities would be 10 times smaller , thus requiring a time - of - flight distance 10 times shorter to satisfy the same timing delays ( eq.1 ; also depicted in fig.1 middle right ) . based on the statistics of flare loop sizes ( typically with loop radii of @xmath40 km , aschwanden et al .",
    "1996c ) , a time - of - flight distance 10 times smaller ( @xmath41 km ) would be comparable with the height of the chromosphere , requiring an acceleration site located near the transition region .",
    "such a scenario would have difficulty to explain the observed simultaneity of hxr emission in conjugate loop footpoints , which were found to be coincident within @xmath42 s ( sakao 1994 ; kosugi 1996 ) , but are separated by considerably larger electron travel times of 0.5 - 1.0 s.    therefore , it seems that all proton models face some fundamental difficulties to reconcile the observed timing delays of impulsive hxr emission .",
    "the bulk of hxr emission ( @xmath43 , depending on the modulation depth of hxr pulses ) is contained in smooth , slowly - varying time structures , which moreover exhibit an opposite sign of the energy - dependent time delay , compared with the fast - fluctuating hxr pulses ( aschwanden et al . 1996b ; 1996c ) .",
    "the timing delays of this _ smooth hxr _ component was therefore interpreted in terms of particle trapping or energy loss inside the flare loop .",
    "this interpretation is mainly motivated by two reasons : ( 1 ) trapping is expected to smear out rapid fluctuations of the acceleration and injection process , and ( 2 ) the collisional deflection time or collisional energy loss time shows a functional dependence ( @xmath44 ) that reproduces the correct sign and fits the functional form of the observed delay @xmath45 ( see example in fig.1 , bottom left ) .",
    "let us consider the collisional deflection time , which in any case should represent an upper limit of the particle trapping time in a flare loop .",
    "the collisional deflection time is defined by ( e.g. benz 1993 ) , @xmath46\\ ] ] with @xmath47 the kinetic energy , @xmath48 the rest mass , and @xmath49 the charge of the test particles , @xmath50 the electron density of the ambient plasma , and @xmath51 the coulomb logarithm .",
    "if we employ @xmath52 kev electrons ( to produce @xmath53 kev hxr photons ) , the expected deflection time is about @xmath54 s in a flare loop with a typical electron density of @xmath55 @xmath56 . considering the fit of @xmath57 to the observed time delay for the flare shown in fig.1 ( bottom left )",
    ", we find that the _ smooth hxr _",
    "flux has timing delays that are consistent with a trapping model in terms of collisional deflection .",
    "if we employ protons , the collisional deflection times would be a factor of @xmath58 longer than for electrons , which is far beyond any delay ever measured in hxrs or gamma rays . the collisional deflection time , though an upper limit , is therefore no reasonable estimator of trapping times for protons .",
    "pitch - angle scattering by strong wave turbulence or cross - field diffusion times in twisted magnetic flux tubes are believed to restrict the trapping times of ions or protons in flare loops to time scales of @xmath59 s ( ramaty & mandzhavidze 1994 ) , which are a factor of @xmath60 longer than collisional deflection times of electrons ( @xmath61 s in typical flare loop densities ; aschwanden et al . 1996a ; 1996b ) .    if we employ protons to generate the @xmath62 kev hxr emission ( e.g. simnett & haines 1990 ) , the precipitating protons are necessarily required to have an identical timing as the observed hxrs .",
    "this requirement for the proton timing can not be reconciled with the observed timing delays of the smooth hxr flux for the following reasons : ( 1 ) if the smooth hxr flux would be produced by directly precipitating protons , the proton timing would have an opposite sign because of time - of - flight differences ; ( 2 ) if the smooth hxr flux would be produced by initially trapped and subsequently precipitating protons , the proton trapping times would be much longer ( a factor of @xmath60 ) than the observed hxr delays , which were found to fit electron collisional deflection times ( fig.1 , bottom left ) . in the latter case",
    ", it would also be very difficult to understand that the trapping times of @xmath63 mev protons would have exactly the same energy - dependence as the collisional deflection time of @xmath4 kev electrons ( see fig.1 , bottom left ) .",
    "thus , we see no suitable possibility to adjust the proton timing to the observed hxr delays , neither in terms of time - of - flight differences nor in terms of trapping time differences .",
    "from previous work we found that the energy - dependent timing delays @xmath45 of solar flare hxr emission in the energy range of @xmath64 kev are consistent with two timing processes : ( 1 ) the timing delays of the _ pulsed _ hxr flux are consistent with electron time - of - flight differences over spatial scales that correspond roughly to half a loop length , and ( 2 ) the timing delays of",
    "the _ smooth _ hxr flux are consistent with collisional deflection times for electrons in typical flare loop densities ( @xmath65 @xmath56 ) .    in an attempt to explain the same timing results of _ hxr pulses _ in terms of protons",
    ", we considered two energy ranges , which both face fundamental difficulties : ( 1 ) @xmath2 mev protons would match the same velocities and time - of - flight differences , but would require a proton flux far in excess of gamma - ray line observations , and ( 2 ) @xmath1 mev protons have a velocity @xmath66 times smaller than 20 kev electrons and can only satisfy the observed time - of - flight differences for flight distances @xmath66 times smaller , which are difficult to reconcile with the observed simultaneity of conjugate hxr footpoint emission .    employing protons to explain the observed timing delays of the _ smooth _",
    "hxr flux would require that the trapping times of protons have the same energy dependence as collisional deflection times for electrons .",
    "this conflicts with estimates of proton trapping times , which are significantly longer than those of electrons , in the case of collisional deflection as well as for pitch - angle scattering by wave turbulence .",
    "based on these timing arguments it appears to be very unlikely that protons are responsible for producing @xmath4 kev hxr bremsstrahlung , e.g. as proposed by simnett & haines ( 1990 ) .",
    "however , these timing results do not exclude that an arbitrary amount of ions ( or protons ) are accelerated concomitantly with electrons and propagate to the chromosphere , as evidenced by the observed nuclear gamma - ray lines ( at 1 - 10 mev ) in large flares .",
    "the main conclusion of this study is that * protons can not be responsible for @xmath4 kev hxr emission * , because their timing would be inconsistent with the observed hxr delays .",
