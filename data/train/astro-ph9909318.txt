    "the study of wave propagation and the stability of optically thin plasmas is of crucial importance for understanding the origin and evolution of inhomogeneities observed at very different length scales and time scales in astrophysical plasmas .",
    "travelling acoustic waves in the plasma can be unstable due to peculiarities of the processes of heating and cooling of the medium .",
    "the possible amplification of the waves is connected with additional energy liberation in the plasma in the compression phase or , in other words , with nonadiabaticity of the plasma . in different astrophysical applications",
    ", the nonadiabaticity of the plasma can be mathematically modelled by an introduction of an additional term in the adiabatic equation .",
    "this term , usually called a heating / cooling function , depends on parameters of the plasma under consideration .",
    "the specific expression for this function varies in different physical situation ( rosner , et .",
    "al . , 1978 ;",
    "vesecky et .",
    "al . , 1979 ; dahlburg and mariska , 1988 ) , but fortunately some general properties of this function define main features of dynamics of perturbations in optically thin plasmas ( either amplification or decay ) .",
    "the above problems , taking into account many different physical effects have been extensively studied as far as the linear approximation is concerned ( parker , 1953 ; kruskal and schwarzschild , 1966 ; weymann , 1960 ; field , 1965 ; priest , 1982 ; ibez and parravano , 1983 ; ibez , 1985 ; ibaez and escalona , 1993 ; bodo et al.,1985 ; balbus and soker , 1989 and references therein ) .",
    "the linear approach corresponds to the case of waves with zero amplitude and , consequently , can describe only an initial stage of the instabilities associated with nonadiabatic effects in the plasma .",
    "generally , the nonlinear regime is not far well understood and most of the progress has been done by numerical simulations of very particular structures ( dahlburg et al . , 1987 ; karpen et al .",
    ", 1989 ; reale et al . ,",
    "1994 ) .",
    "in addition to condensations that can be formed in hot plasmas by thermal instability in a nonadiabatic plasma , providing that the instability does not saturate in the nonlinear regime , the steeping of travelling waves may also originate inhomogeneities ( oppenheimer , 1977 ; krasnobaev , 1975 ; krasnobaev and tarev , 1987 ( reference kt herein after ) ; tarev , 1993 ) .",
    "this problem has been worked out in kt and tarev ( 1993 ) references neglecting the presence of magnetic fields . however , in many astrophysical situations the magnetic fields become relevant , therefore , it is worthy to analyse the propagation of nonlinear magnetoacoustic waves in plasmas where nonadiabatic effects also go into play .",
    "this problem beyond its heuristic interest , also can be the clue for understanding particular observed features in magnetised plasmas , for instance , the intensity oscillations observed in the network bright points in the quiet sun ( kalkofen , 1997 ) .",
    "also , in the presence of the magnetic field , the magnetoacoustic waves perturb the absolute value and components of the field , which gives an additional possibility for the registration of the discussed phenomena in astrophysical plasmas through observation of variation of gyro - emission , zeeman effect etc .",
    "the aim of the present paper is the general study of weakly nonlinear magnetoacoustic and alfvn wave dynamics in presence of nonadiabatic effects in an optically thin plasma .",
    "we consider a homogeneous plasma penetrated by the straight and homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "effects of self - gravitation , ionization and steady flows are neglected .",
    "the physical state is determined by time and spatial independent variables .",
    "additionally , the heating / cooling function ( per unit volume and time ) is assumed to be dependent of pressure and density , i.e. @xmath3 . only quadratic nonlinear effects will be taken into account .",
    "assumption that nonlinear and nonadiabatic effects are weak , but not necessarily of the same order , allows us to apply the method of slowly varying amplitudes and derive an evolutionary equation for fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves .",
    "note that , despite the nonlinearity considered in the paper is weak , it leads to the significant modification of the wave , up to formation of shocks . in the derivation of the evolutionary equation ,",
    "a single wave approximation is applied .",
    "this means that interaction of waves of different types , as well as interaction of forward and backward waves , is neglected .",
    "the nonlinear interaction of different modes , for example , three - wave interaction , occurs when all interacting modes are existing in the system ( and are , actually , over some certain amplitude threshold prescribed by dissipation ) .",
    "also , efficiency of the interaction depends strongly on coherence of the interacting waves .",
    "both these conditions are assumed to be not fulfilled : we consider a wave of one certain type only , while other modes are not excited .",
    "also , our attention is restricted to evolution of wave pulses with a wide spectrum , and nonlinear resonant interactions are suppressed .",
    "thus , the dominating nonlinear process is generation of higher harmonics , leading to wave steepening and shock formation .",
    "moreover , this process is more pronounced due to the absence of linear high frequency dispersion .",
    "nonlinear dispersion preventing the second harmonics generation , may appear in the next order of nonlinearity and is out of scopes of the paper .",
    "since the thermally unstable plasma is an _ active _ medium for the magnetoacoustic waves , the solution of the evolutionary equation shows the amplification of the initial magnetoacoustic perturbation and speeding up of shock formation .",
    "the breaking time depends on the angle of the wave propagation with respect to the magnetic field and is different for slow and fast waves .",
    "the above results are quite general and potentially can be applied to different astrophysical as well as laboratory plasmas . however , in this paper , the results obtained will be addressed to study a hot ( @xmath0 @xmath4 atomic plasma ( solar atmosphere or hot interstellar medium ) and a cold ( @xmath2 @xmath5 molecular gas ( say for instance , the cold ism gas ) .",
    "in the model considered , dynamics of the plasma is described by the set of mhd equations ,    @xmath6    @xmath7    @xmath8    @xmath9    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is a known function describing effects of the nonadiabaticity and all other notations are standard .",

    "( 1997a , b , 1998 ) for mhd waves of finite amplitude in smoothly inhomogeneous cold plasma .",
    "an analysis of the right handsides of equations ( [ aw ] ) and ( [ msw ] ) shows that if the alfvnic perturbations ( i.e. @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) are initially absent from the system , they can not be excited by the magnetoacoustic perturbations , because all terms on the right handside of ( [ aw ] ) are _ products _ of alfvn and magnetoacoustic variables .",
    "this gives an advantage for an analytical description of the nonlinear dynamics of the magnetoacoustic waves , allowing to take @xmath74 and @xmath73 zero always and everywhere .",
    "strictly speaking , this assumption is non - physical , because alfvnic perturbations are always presented in the realistic plasma as noise .",
    "consequently , in the natural conditions there is a nonlinear interaction of alfvn and magnetoacoustic waves . nevertheless ,",
    "if the level of alfvnic noise is initially sufficiently low , the assumption can be applied to the description of magnetoacoustic waves in some certain initial stage of the interaction , when nonlinear terms including alfvn variables are much less than magnetoacoustic terms .",

    "now we take that the influence of the heating / cooling function on the wave propagation is small , in other words , we suppose that in equation ( [ msw ] ) the third term on the left handside is much less than the other linear terms . also , the quadratically nonlinear terms are taken into account . in the weakly nonlinear , weakly non - adiabatic case ,",

    "2a and 3a , the sign of the coefficient of nonadiabaticity is opposite to the sign of the parameter @xmath138 introduced in ( [ expa ] ) .",

    "therefore , if one assumes that the plasma heats as @xmath151 @xmath152 @xmath153 @xmath154 ( dahlburg & mariska 1988 ) , then , it becomes isentropically unstable ( @xmath143 ) in the ranges of temperature @xmath155 @xmath1 , @xmath156 @xmath1 and @xmath157 @xmath1 for @xmath158 @xmath1 for heating by coronal current dissipation ( @xmath159 ) and heating by alfvn mode / mode conversion ( @xmath160 and in the range @xmath161 @xmath1 for a constant heating per unit of mass ( @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",

    "the distance between the point where the disturbance is originated to the point where the shock is formed , is of the order of @xmath212 .",
    "therefore , from above results one may conclude  that strong inhomogeneities are expected to be formed at time scales and scale - lengths  shorter than those for which the molecular gas becomes thermally unstable .",
    "we considered dynamics of magnetohydrodynamic waves in a nonadiabatic plasma taking into account effects of finite wave amplitude .",
    "the nonadiabaticity was modelled by a general cooling / heating function of thermodynamic parameters of the plasma .",
    "depending on a general structure of the nonadiabatic function , there are two different regimes of the wave evolution in the system , either amplification or decay .",
    "the nonlinearity , through generation of highest harmonics , leads to the wave steepening and , therefore , to formation of shock waves .",
    "our analysis was restricted by this shock formation time . in the linearly unstable case ( usually called the thermal instability )",
    ", the formation of the shock takes place quicker than in adiabatic case .",
    "consequently , nonlinearity depresses the thermal instability of magnetoacoustic waves , whose growth is accompanied by the wave steepening and lasts until the shock has been formed .    in the single wave approximation",
    ", we have derived an evolutionary equation describing development of weakly nonlinear magnetoacoustic waves in a weakly nonadiabatic medium .",
    "this equation is valid for one magnetoacoustic wave ( either slow or fast ) providing that another wave is absent from the system .",
    "of course , in realistic situation , both slow and fast waves are excited simultaneously",
    ". nevertheless , the difference in their propagation speeds gives us a possibility to restrict our consideration by the single wave approximation , because the waves occupy different locations in time after the excitation ( they are spatially de - tuned from each other ) . since the magnetic field brings spatial anisotropy in the system considered , parameters of the magnetoacoustic wave propagation ( the speed , the rate of growth or decay , the breaking time ) depend upon the direction of the wave vector .",
    "the third magnetoacoustic mode , the alfvn wave , is not subject to the influence of the nonadiabaticity ( as far as the quadratic nonlinear terms approximation holds ) .",
    "this does not exclude a possibility of the indirect effect of the nonadiabaticity of the plasma on the alfvn wave through nonlinear coupling with the magnetoacoustic wave amplified by thermal instability .",
    "the nonlinear excitation of the alfvn waves is described by eq .",
    "( [ aw ] ) .",
    "according to above discussion , the active non - adiabaticity of the plasma leads to excitation of magnetoacoustic waves perturbing the variables @xmath57 , @xmath56 , @xmath58 , @xmath190 and @xmath55 . expressing all variables through @xmath58 by ( [ erho])-([ebx ] ) , we can re - write the nonlinear alfvn wave equation ( [ aw ] ) for two variables , @xmath74 and @xmath213 : @xmath214 @xmath215 where @xmath216 is an inverse differential operator . in the case of a harmonical magnetoacoustic wave , eq .",

    "the spectrum of the exciting magnetoacoustic wave is much reacher than harmonical and evolves in time and space .",
    "however , qualitatively , we can expect that alfvn waves are nonlinearly generated by the thermal instability through the discussed mechanism .",
    "this phenomenon has been omitted from this consideration .",
    "the theory developed here may be applied , in particular , to an interpretation of origin of density , temperature and magnetic field variations in astrophysical plasmas , which can be associated with the magnetoacoustic weak shock waves ( see , krasnobaev , 1975 ) . with respect to the previously analysed case of the unmagnetised plasma ,",
    "the presence of the magnetic field gives several advantages for the observational registration of these phenomena .",
    "firstly , in the vicinity of the shock front , the sharp inhomogeneity of the absolute value of the magnetic field takes place , which can be directly registered by analysis of variation of parameters of gyro - emission and zeeman splitting .",
    "even if the wave amplitude is sufficiently small , the sharp gradients in the absolute value of the magnetic field in the vicinity of the shock are accompanied by high densities of the electric currents ( the transversal component of the current density is proportional to the spatial derivative of the magnetic field perturbation , @xmath217 ) .",
    "these current concentrations ( or current sheets , in the ideal limit ) can be regions where particle acceleration takes place .",
    "secondly , slow and fast magnetoacoustic perturbations , initially excited somehow , propagate with different speeds and growth rates and , therefore , form different spatial structures at different distance from their source . according to formula ( [ eee ] ) , perturbations of the magnetic field are either positively or negatively correlated with perturbations of the plasma density , depending on the type of the mode ( slow or fast ) , which gives us a possibility to distinguish fast and slow modes in analysed data .    from the point of view of the nonlinear wave dynamics , propagation of the mhd waves in",
    "the optically thin plasma is a very attractive problem , because the plasma is acting in this case as an active medium , supplying energy to the waves .",
    "the simplest model considered here can be further developed .",
    "for example , high frequency dissipation ( modelled by introduction of a burgers term in equation ( [ ke ] ) ) , will compete with the amplification and depress nonlinear generation of highest harmonics .",
    "when these phenomena are in balance , there exist dissipative stationary waves with `` saw - teeth '' shape . also , the generation of the second harmonics and so the energy transfer to small scales can be depressed by nonlinear dispersion ( whitham , 1974 ) .",
    "this process is based upon either cubic nonlinearity , or quadratic nonlinearity through cascade self - interaction .",
    "the last mechanism has two stages : nonlinear generation of second harmonics and interaction of the second harmonics with a backward wave . in the case of magnetoacoustic waves",
    ", both mechanisms are acting together ( nakariakov et al . , 1997b ) leading to the appearance of a cubically nonlinear term in the evolutionary equation .",
    "obviously , the cubically nonlinear effects should be taken into account only when quadratically nonlinear processes are suppressed due to , e.g. , linear high frequency dispersion .",
    "effects of dispersion ( connected possibly with electron inertia or , which is more important for astrophysical applications , with inhomogeneity of the plasma ) can be modelled by introduction of a korteweg - de vries ( or benjamin - ono or leibovich - roberts , depending on the specific situation ) term in evolutionary equation ( [ ke ] ) .",
    "particularly , the dispersion of the medium can give a possibility for existence of autosolitons and stochastic dynamical regimes ( see , e.g. engelbrecht , 1989 , nakariakov and roberts 1999 ) .",
    "these phenomena can be registered in astrophysical plasmas and be applied to interpretation of the observations .",
    "finally , we must remark that in atomic as well as in molecular plasma occurring in astrophysics , many other physical effects likely go into play , such as inhomogeneity in the background due to self - gravitation and/or to radiation transport , and dissipative effects ( viscosity , thermal conduction , ionization - recombinations and chemical reactions ) .",
    "these phenomena have to  be taken into account in more developed models .",
    "however , the above results indicate that inside thermally unstable plasma regions , substructures can be originated by nonlinear effects in times shorter than an e - folding time for evolving the isentropic thermal instability .",
    "vmn is grateful to prof bernard roberts and dr mikhail ruderman for a number of stimulating discussions .",

    "<S> the evolution of quasi - isentropic magnetohydrodynamic waves of small but finite amplitude in an optically thin plasma is analyzed . the plasma is assumed to be initially homogeneous , in thermal equilibrium and with a straight and homogeneous magnetic field frozen in . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the particular form of the heating / cooling function , the plasma may act as a dissipative or active medium for magnetoacoustic waves , while alfvn waves are not directly affected . </S>",
    "<S> an evolutionary equation for fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves in the single wave limit , has been derived and solved , allowing us to analyse the wave modification by competition of weakly nonlinear and quasi - isentropic effects . it was shown that the sign of the quasi - isentropic term determines the scenario of the evolution , either dissipative or active . in the dissipative case , </S>",
    "<S> when the plasma is first order isentropically stable the magnetoacoustic waves are damped and the time for shock wave formation is delayed . however , in the active case when the plasma is isentropically overstable , the wave amplitude grows , the strength of the shock increases and the breaking time decreases . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the above effects depends upon the angle between the wave vector and the magnetic field . for hot ( @xmath0 @xmath1 ) atomic plasmas with solar abundances either in the interstellar medium or in the solar atmosphere , as well as for the cold ( @xmath2 @xmath1 ) ism molecular gas , the range of temperature where the plasma is isentropically unstable and the corresponding time and length - scale for wave breaking have been found . </S>"
