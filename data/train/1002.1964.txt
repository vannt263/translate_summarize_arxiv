    "general ellipsoidal density perturbations collapse sequentially along their three axes leading to matter accreting first onto a sheet , then collapsing to a filament before matter finally streams along the filaments into the densest regions . as a consequence of these processes , the large - scale morphology of the cosmic web might leave its imprint on the orientations of galaxies through the anisotropy of accretion and mergers .",
    "recently , evidence has accumulated that galaxies are indeed not oriented randomly with respect to one another . on small scales ,",
    "several studies report a radial alignment of satellite galaxies towards the centre of mass of the group or cluster in which they reside ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "such an alignment is predicted by n - body simulations of dark matter halos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "it is commonly believed that tidal torques are responsible for this radial alignment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as tidal forces on these relatively small scales ( @xmath9 mpc ) are sufficiently strong to affect halo shapes on short time - scales .",

    "the relative weakness on galaxy scales of tidal forces arising from the @xmath13 scales requires that such effects maintain spatial coherence over rather long time scales for them to be able to affect galaxy properties .",
    "also it is not clear how they are counteracted by local non - linear effects in the most immediate vicinity of the galaxy : non - linear gravitational effects as well as ram pressure exerted on the disk gas could potentially lead to a reorientation of galactic angular momentum . furthermore ,",

    "while understanding the formation of galaxies in the context of their host large - scale structure is a key question for galaxy formation theory , a precise knowledge of correlated galaxy orientations is of high importance also for future high - precision weak lensing studies of dark energy .",
    "weak lensing signals can be severely affected by systematic contaminations due to large - scale alignments in the spatial distribution of cosmic matter on scales from a few to more than a hundred mpc ( due to galaxy ellipticity - ellipticity alignment : @xcite ; and due to the much more problematic shear - ellipticity alignment : @xcite ) .",
    "approaches that have been suggested so far to remove the contamination due to shear - ellipticity alignment suffer from several limitations and uncertainties : the statistical down - weighting of the effect proposed by @xcite relies on precision determinations of photometric galaxy redshifts ; other techniques , such as proposed by e.g. @xcite , depend heavily on toy models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which do not include any ( as yet unknown ) dependence of alignments on galaxy luminosity , mass , or redshift .",

    "unfortunately , it is currently still computationally unfeasible to use hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation of the necessary resolution in a sufficiently large volume to investigate the correlation function of galaxy shapes and spins . to circumvent this barrier ,",
    "some authors have used large - volume @xmath15-body simulations together with a prescription to assign galactic disk orientations to the dark matter haloes which typically either assumes perfect alignment with the dm halo spin or some random misalignment angle between the two ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "also analytic models based on the halo model have been developed that include prescriptions for small scale satellite - central alignments @xcite .",

    "the results of @xcite on the basis of four sph simulations of the formation of single isolated galaxies indicate an alignment of the spin of these galaxies with the intermediate principal axis of the tidal field at turnaround that persists to a slightly weaker degree also to @xmath2 .    in this paper , we study the orientation of a sample of @xmath1 galactic discs with respect to their larger scale environment in a hydrodynamical cosmological simulation of the formation of a large filament .",
    "we have chosen this particular large - scale environment as it provides an environment where the gravitational shear is expected to be relatively large so that weak lensing shear should have good signal - to - noise .",
    "any intrinsic alignment of galaxies on these scales will thus impact the measurements through the gi - lensing term .",
    "prior investigations in dark matter cosmological simulations have shown evidence for alignment of halo spin with filaments . however , considering the gas component rather than dark matter , the filament is a high pressure environment so that hydrodynamic effects , such as ram - pressure , are expected to play a role in the evolution of the simulated galaxies .",

    "the filament was chosen by visual inspection of the environment of the most massive haloes in a dark - matter - only preflight simulation .",
    "we then chose a filament that is very prominent ( and thus relatively massive ) and not criss - crossed by too many smaller scale filaments .",
    "initial conditions were generated using the grafic-2 tool from a power spectrum computed with linger .",
    "we adopt cosmological parameters as obtained from the wmap 5th year data release @xcite , i.e. we use the density parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , a power spectrum normalisation of @xmath22 and a spectral index @xmath23 for the primordial spectrum , as well as a hubble constant of @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "the filament is simulated using the `` zoom - in '' technique as a high - resolution region of @xmath26 diameter at redshift @xmath2 inside of a comoving @xmath27 cosmological box .",
    "the effective initial resolution of our simulation is @xmath28 particles and grid points inside this high - resolution region , dropping in steps of 8 to @xmath29 in the remainder of the box .",
    "additional refinements are confined to the high - resolution region only .",
    "we adopt a refinement strategy based on density threshold so that the number of particles per cell ( and the baryon mass per cell ) remains roughly constant in time .",
    "since the filament moves slightly in space , we introduce a `` colour '' field to mark the lagrangian volume of the filament .",
    "this field is passively advected during the formation of the structures and thus follows the evolution of the filament perfectly . in order to save memory , we used as colouring variable the metallicity of the gas , with a very low ( but non - zero ) value of @xmath30 solar in the high resolution region and exactly zero outside .",
    "additional refinements are only allowed where the metallicity exceeds one tenth of this initial value .",
    "in addition , cooling and star formation are also switched off in non - coloured regions .",
    "the maximum resolution of our simulation is _ physical _ @xmath31 at all times .",
    "in addition , our lagrangian volume excludes the most massive galaxy groups ( halo mass above @xmath32 at @xmath2 ) in order to speed up computation as we are only interested in smaller objects in this study .    the two panels of figure [ fig : thefilament ] give a visual impression of the filament at @xmath2 .",
    "we show two panels , the first illustrating the distribution of dark matter , the second is a composite image representing the density , pressure and metallicity distribution in the gas .",
    "note that the main filament is entirely wrapped by an accretion shock .",
    "it is thus clearly a high pressure environment .",
    "the less massive filaments remain cold except at node points where the more massive haloes reside .",
    "an inspection of the time - evolution of the simulation reveals that this accretion shock emerges first from the most massive haloes along the filament but then grows along the filament boundaries until the entire filament is enclosed by a shock .    in the two panels of figure [ fig : thegalaxies ] , we show two examples of well - resolved disk - galaxies at @xmath2 in the simulation .",
    "the images represent a simulated stellar light composite image combining the i , r and g bands into an rgb image taking into account dust reddening along the line of sight .",
    "the images also show the orientation of the stellar and gaseous angular momentum and indicate that these are perpendicular to the disks and well aligned with one another .      in order to identify galaxies in the simulated data ,",
    "we directly use the amr mesh structure and label contiguous volumes exceeding a density threshold .",
    "first , we pick the highest refinement level which exceeds @xmath33kpc resolution in order to smooth out galactic substructure .",
    "next , we keep only those cells on this level , which exceed a threshold @xmath34 in baryonic overdensity .",
    "this particular choice of @xmath35 has been found to be in excellent agreement with a visual identification of the galaxies . in a final step",
    "we label all contiguous regions that are left .",
    "this labelling is performed using a parallel implementation of the hoshen - kopelman cluster finding algorithm @xcite .",
    "finally , all star particles and gas cells ( also on higher refinement levels ) are assigned to the mesh cluster @xmath36 , i.e. the `` galaxy '' , in which they reside .",
    "galaxy stellar centres are then determined by iteratively computing the stellar centre of mass within shrinking spherical apertures and moving the aperture to the new centre in each iteration .",
    "the procedure is stopped once less than 50 particles are contained within the aperture .",
    "the centre of the gaseous disk is defined as the densest gas cell in the galaxy and the centre of the inner dark matter halo is defined as the most bound dark matter particle when evaluating the potential for all dark matter particles that are contained in the galaxy patch .    in order to determine halo masses and virial radii , we grow spheres around each galaxy centre until the enclosed matter overdensity falls below the overdensity @xmath37 of a virialised spherical perturbation in a @xmath8cdm cosmology as given by the fitting formula of @xcite . in a next step ,",
    "we determine equivalence classes of galaxies that are contained within the virial radii of each other . the galaxy with the highest stellar mass in each equivalence class we call the `` central galaxy '' , all other class members are `` satellite galaxies '' .",
    "we do not consider these satellite galaxies further in this study .",
    "finally , unresolved galaxies are identified by tracking the dark matter particles that end up in galaxies back to the initial conditions and requiring that none of them started in a region that was not initially marked for cooling and refinement .",
    "these unresolved galaxies are then removed from the galaxy catalogue .    the central galaxies in our samples have stellar radii @xmath38 ( which is the radius that contains 95 per cent of the stellar mass ) that are at most 0.11 at @xmath5 , 0.095 at @xmath39 and @xmath40 at @xmath2 of the virial radius of their parent halo .",
    "this makes us confident that the identified galaxies are not contaminated by other satellites in the halo and thus constitute clean samples of central galaxies .      for our analysis , we keep only the best resolved galaxies with at least 25000 star particles , corresponding to a minimum stellar mass of @xmath41 . for these galaxies , @xmath42 , the radius containing 80% of the stellar mass is resolved by at least 8 resolution elements .",
    "furthermore , this requirement implies that we can compare our results to a lower resolution run ( see appendix [ sec : numerical_artefacts ] ) for which the minimum star particle number for galaxies of equal mass is then a factor of 8 lower , but still above 3000 .",
    "we split the sample of well - resolved galaxies according to their host halo masses into 3 different halo groups .",
    "the high - mass sample is defined as all halos above the non - linear mass @xmath43 .",
    "prior results using pure @xmath15-body simulations have indicated that @xmath44 might be a characteristic scale for the spin - alignment behaviour of dark matter haloes ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "haloes above this critical mass are believed to host a hot pressurized atmosphere that can exert ram pressure effects on the central galaxy .",

    "this approach has two main advantages : ( 1 ) as demonstrated in @xcite , the tidal field provides a natural dynamical quantification of the geometry of the large - scale structure ; and ( 2 ) any local alignments with the tidal field directly translate into shear - ellipticity alignments in weak lensing @xcite . in addition , when supplemented with auto - correlation functions of the non - linear tidal field ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , local alignments with the tidal field can be translated into correlation functions .",
    "we will investigate this approach in future work .",
