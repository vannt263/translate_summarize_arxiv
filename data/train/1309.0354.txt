    "exoplanets have been one of the major areas of interests in astrophysics over the last few years . since the first exoplanet detections @xcite ,",
    "the number of discoveries has grown at an ever increasing rate .",
    "although the majority of confirmed exoplanets are hot - jupiter types , in recent years the first super - earths ( rocky bodies several times the size of the earth ) have already been identified ( e.g. @xcite ) , and more recently , the discovery of the first earth - like planet located in the habitable zone of the host star has been reported @xcite .",
    "however , the detection of small rocky planets is only the first step ; the characterization of their atmospheres and even the possibility of detecting the fingerprints of life will be next .",
    "an understanding of the instrumental challenges involved in these atmospheric characterisation studies @xcite requires experience in the interpretation of planetary spectra . in this sense , observations of the earth as a distant planet , which can be obtained",
    "using earthshine observations , will be a very useful template .",
    "the earthshine refers to the sunlight reflected from the dayside of the earth to the dark side of the moon , and back to the night - side of the earth .",
    "it provides information about the hemispherically - averaged earth s reflectance ( figure  [ fig : earthshine ] ) .",
    "the earthshine observation technique requires near simultaneous data from both the moon s sunlit side , hereafter referred to as the brightside ( bs ) , and the darker earth - lit portion of the moon , hereafter referred to as the darkside ( ds ) .",
    "the earthshine provides information about variations in the earth s albedo , one of the most important parameters to understand the energetic balance of the planet .",
    "along one night , possible variations can be explained by changes in the extent of cloud cover , or by the region of the earth that is being illuminated during the observations .",
    "continuous observations of this parameter using the earthshine technique makes it possible to characterize yearly and decadal changes in albedo @xcite .",
    ", width=317 ]    the spectral dependence of the earth s albedo has previously been reported @xcite . in these studies",
    "the earthshine was measured in low spectral resolution to identify the absorption bands present in the earth s atmosphere , which at visible wavelengths mainly result from water vapour and oxygen @xcite .",
    "additionally , the contribution of vegetation to the earth s spectrum has also been detected through the slope of the so - called red - edge , the difference in the intensity in the continuum between 680 and 740 nm , due to the reflection at the reddest wavelengths caused by the presence of chlorophyll @xcite .",
    "going one step further , the earthshine technique applied with high spectral resolution can be used to detect absorption lines from individual atoms present in earth s atmosphere , specifically from metallic elements , such as fe , li , k , ca or na . these elements are usually found in atmospheric layers located at altitudes between 75 and 110 km .",
    "their origin is generally assumed to be from the ablation of meteoroids , and they have been regularly observed from the ground using the lidar ( light detection and ranging ) measurements @xcite .",
    "these elements have been used to study the influence of temperature , vertical transport , and meridional wind convergence , in the seasonal structure of the upper atmosphere @xcite .",
    "changes in their density or composition can also provide information about meteor composition after a meteor shower . the signal of an atmospheric metallic component , such as na i doublet , in the earthshine data has been searched for before using the not ( nordic optical telescope ) spectrograph , alfosc ( andalucia faint object spectrograph and camera ) , with a resolving power of 1000 .",
    "the results were inconclusive due to a lack of resolving power ( @xcite , private communication ) .    in the present study ,",
    "the earthshine technique applied with high - resolution spectroscopy has been used to measure the metallic layers present in the earth s globally - averaged upper atmosphere .",
    "the observations were performed during different nights with the aim of detecting their temporal variability .",
    "observations were taken with the telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) telescope , at el roque de los muchachos ( orm ) , using the sarg ( spettrografo alta risoluzione galileo ) instrument .",
    "sarg is a cross - dispersed echelle spectrograph which covers wavelengths from 370 to 1000 nm .",
    "the red ( @xmath0 nm ) and blue ( @xmath1 nm ) cross dispersers used cover the whole available spectral range , and were both set at a resolving power of 29,000 , corresponding to a slit size of 0.30@xmath21.15 mm .",
    "these data were taken during the nights of 2011 february 11 , 12 , 23 and 24 .",
    "the moon illuminated area was 57 per cent , for the first two nights and 60 per cent , for the last two ( lunar phase close to @xmath3 ) . for observations at lunar phases closer to new moon , the observing time is not long enough to get useful data ( moon sets ) , while at lunar phases closer to full moon , the scattered light from the much brighter lunar bs area contaminates the ds images ( figure  [ fig : lunar_phases ] ) .",
    "the magnitude of this contamination depends on the phase of the moon , the airmass and meteorological conditions .    ]",
    "the observations were taken in repetitive cycles : a set of bs spectra , followed by one spectrum of the ds near the lunar edge , then one spectrum of the sky near the lunar edge of the ds selected spot , and finally another set of spectra of the bs ( table  [ tbl : obser_data ] ) .",
    "the exposure time of the images changed with airmass along the night , and from one night to the next .",
    "typically , bs exposures were set between 10 and 30 s while ds and sky exposures were set between 900 and 1,200 s. these cyclic observations are the best strategy to correct for the airmass variations from one image to the next",
    ". the images were reduced , and the spectra extracted , using the standard software tools from iraf packages . to obtain more accurate results",
    "each of the echelle orders was analysed independently .",
    "the wavelength calibration was addressed using thar lamps taken the nights of 11th and 24th of february .",
    "the dispersion function obtained had an rms ( root mean square ) @xmath40.03 for the red grism and @xmath40.016 for the blue .",
    "it is possible that the pixel - wavelength correlation varies between different nights , however , the earth s reflection spectrum is calculated through the ratio of images taken consecutively and therefore with the same possible shift .",
    "the data reduction also included the removal of cosmic rays using the imlacos software @xcite .",
    ".number of images taken for each observation night and cycle for bs , ds and sky . in columns 5 and 6 , the mean signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) for each image type ( bs / ds / sky ) is given for the spectrum in the na and h@xmath5 orders , respectively .",
    "[ tbl : obser_data ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the rest of the nights of our observing campaign have been analysed following the same procedure as for the observations on 2011 february 11 .",
    "the significance of the na lines for each cycle , expressed as standard deviation of the pseudo - continuum are given in table  [ tbl : obser_days ] . in the table",
    "the values of the snr of each cycle and the mean air mass of the observations have been included .",
    "possible differences in the detection between cycles and especially between nights can be related to weather conditions and not only with changes in the airmass .",
    "the presence of cirrus cloud or high humidity can lead to a larger scattering from the brightside of the moon .",
    "this effect makes the correction of the sky in the darkside images more difficult . in one case ,",
    "cycle 3 of 2011 february , 11 the na detection was found to be over the 3 sigma level , however , other solar lines were also detectable in the earthshine spectrum . consequently these detections have been associated with an incorrect sky subtraction and thus rejected .    ]    to illustrate the effect that an incorrect sky correction can have in the final spectra , in figure  [ fig : fact_cielo ] the earth s reflection spectrum for the night of the 2011 february 11 , calculated following equation  [ ecuacion ] , has been represented with three different sky corrections , considering factors of 20 per cent to clearly illustrate the possible effects on the final spectrum .",
    "the top panel shows the result of multiplying the sky by 1.2 simulating an overestimated subtraction , the centre panel uses the original sky spectrum , and the lower panel corresponds with a sky multiplied by 0.8 , an underestimated correction . the same scale in the _",
    "y_-axis has been used in all the panels for comparison . in the top panel",
    "the spectral lines become deeper , and in particular solar lines like the one at 593.01 nm can be clearly recognised above the noise . in the bottom panel",
    "the under - corrected atmospheric and solar lines become emission lines .",
    "these features in each case can be used to identify if the sky correction has been applied properly",
    ". a multiplicative factor of 0.94 ( 6 per cent ) is needed to remove the sodium lines .",
    "however , this multiplicative factor has to be applied to all orders , and such a correction leads to the appearance of emission lines in alomost all orders , introducing artefacts into the data . throughout this manuscript ,",
    "we have not used any multiplicative factor in our analysis .",
    "we have searched for other absorption lines in the rest of the echelle orders , where other atomic lines belonging to the earth s atmosphere could have been detected .",
    "although there are some hints of detection , we can not confirm them because although these lines are found at their theoretical wavelengths , more intense lines of the same element are not detected .",
    "this could be because they fall in a ccd region with a low signal - to - noise ratio or because they are located inside an atmospheric absorption band .",
    "the lines for which we may have tentative detections are : fe i at 372.76 , 374.33 , 374.94 , 375.82 , 404.81 , 492.05 , 496.60 , 513.36 , 509.07 , 594.93 and 602.40 nm , ca i at 422.67 , 443.56 , 445.47 and 445.58 nm and na i at 568.81 nm .",
    "these tentative detections , however , will need further data for confirmation .",
    "the na layer in the earth s atmosphere is normally located between 80 and 90 km height , in the mesosphere .",
    "the abundance of this metallic ion has a seasonal variation , with a maximum one month before the winter solstice and a minimum close to the summer solstice @xcite .",
    "its abundance has been observed to be highly dependent on meteoric activity @xcite . using lidar measurements , the sporadic sodium layers ( ssls )",
    "were discovered in 1978 @xcite .",
    "ssls are very dense layers , of only a couple of kilometres vertical thickness , which form in a matter of minutes and persist for periods of hours @xcite .",
    "ssls form mostly between 15:00 and 00:00 local time , and the presence of the sporadic ionospheric e layer is related to its appearance @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : tierra ] the region of the earth visible from the moon at the beginning and at the end of the observations is shown for two nights for which we have observations .",
    "the area illuminated by the sun changes from the canary island s westwards view ( america and the pacific ocean ) in the first two nights ( 11 and 12 february ) to the east view ( africa , antarctica , atlantic and indian oceans ) for the las two ( 23 and 24 of february ) .",
    "the observations include very different regions of the world , but the na lines are only visible in some cycles , independently of the geographic area observed .",
    "this could be related with the presence of ssls in the upper atmosphere . due to the small snr we have in our data , snr@xmath420 , it is possible that a na signal was visible only in the cycles in which a ssls existed .",
    "the fact that these episodes last only a few hours could explain why the na lines are not visible in all the cycles taken .",
    "previous studies of the na layers used the lidar technique during specific observation campaigns , getting local atmosphere information during certain time periods . since the earthshine technique provides integrated data from the whole earth s dayside visible area from the moon , lidar data are not useful to validate our results .",
    "the best source of information would be earth s na dayside satellite observations , but unfortunately , such data do not exist .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the h@xmath5 absorption line is present in the solar spectrum but not in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "however this line can be found in emission in earth s spectrum and has its origin in the helium present in the geocorona . this h@xmath5 emission is a result of a fluorescence process initiated by lymman @xmath5 ( 121 nm ) solar photons @xcite , and it is used to chart the geocorona as its illumination depends on the time and the geometry of the observations @xcite . however , the h@xmath5 residuals in our spectra are not related with the emission from the earth s geocorona , but with the incomplete sky subtraction to the darkside .",
    "if this correction was perfect , and supposing the geocorona was detectable , such detection would appear as an emission line in our spectra .",
    "the earth s reflectance spectrum has been observed with the earthshine technique using sarg at the tng telescope , with a resolving power of @xmath6 .",
    "this experiment is the first time in which this technique has been applied using such high resolution . this high resolving power has allowed us to test the detectability of atomic lines in the earth s averaged reflectance spectrum .",
    "the most difficult part of the analysis of these dataset is the precise correction for the background sky .",
    "nevertheless , by imposing high confidence constrains for a detection , we find that atomic na lines were detected during different observational nights , but not all . we conclude that the origin of these lines lies in the earth s upper atmosphere , and thus have geological or meteoritic origins .",
    "the fact that these lines are not visible along all the nights and for all the observational cycles could be related to the presence of the ssl layer in the sun - illuminated fraction of the earth .",
    "the known transitional nature of these events could explain why sometimes the na is not visible in our spectra , while it is detectable a few hours later .",
    "thus , we suggest that rather more continuous observations of the earthshine could be used to monitor and understand the nature and variability of the na layer at global scales",
    ".    other possible atomic lines of terrestrial origin have been tentatively detected , but they can not be confirmed with the present data due to the low snr ( which results from such high spectral resolution and the faintest of the earthshine ) .",
    "confirmation of these possible atomic lines in the future requires observations of the earthshine at an intermediate resolution ( around @xmath7 ) , enough to increase the snr of the observations while keeping the possibility of detecting atomic lines .",
    "this work was based on observations made with the telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) operated on the island of la palma by the fundacin galileo galilei - inaf , fundacin canaria in the spanish observatorio de roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofsica de canarias , and supported by the non - longer existing spanish ministry of ciencia e innovacin under the grant cgl2009 - 10641 .",
