    "several interesting critical transitions are effectively described by a matrix order parameter with symmetry o(2)@xmath0o(@xmath1 ) and symmetry - breaking pattern o(2)@xmath0o(@xmath1)@xmath2o(2)@xmath0o(@xmath3 ) .",
    "this is the case , for @xmath5 or @xmath6 , of multicomponent frustrated magnetic systems with noncollinear order , in which frustration may arise either because of the special geometry of the lattice or from the competition of different kinds of interactions .",
    "typical examples of systems of the first type are stacked triangular antiferromagnets ( sta s ) , in which the magnetic ions are located at the sites of a stacked triangular lattice .",
    "frustration due to the competition of interactions is realized in helimagnets , in which a magnetic spiral is formed along a certain direction of the lattice .",
    "the nature of the magnetic transition in these materials has been the object of several studies , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews .",
    "in particular , the order of the transition is still controversial , with several contradictory results both on theoretical and experimental sides .",
    "the landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) theory with o(2)@xmath0o(@xmath1 ) symmetry that is expected to describe these systems is given by @xcite @xmath7 + { 1\\over 4!}u_0 \\bigl ( \\sum_a \\phi_a^2\\bigr)^2 + { 1\\over 4 ! }   v_0 \\sum_{a , b } \\bigl [ ( \\phi_a \\cdot \\phi_b)^2 - \\phi_a^2\\phi_b^2\\bigr ]               \\bigr\\ } , \\label{lgwh}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) are @xmath1-component vectors .",

    "negative values of @xmath11 lead to a different symmetry - breaking pattern : the ground state configurations have a ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic order and correspond to o(2)@xmath0o(@xmath1)@xmath12o(@xmath13 ) . for @xmath14",
    "the model is also of interest ; it describes magnets with sinusoidal spin structures  @xcite and , for @xmath6 , the superfluid transition of @xmath15he @xcite ; see , e.g. , refs .",

    ", we will only focus on the case @xmath10 and thus whenever we speak of an o(2)@xmath0o(@xmath1 ) universality class we refer to the case in which the symmetry - breaking pattern is o(2)@xmath0o(@xmath1)@xmath2o(2)@xmath0o(@xmath3 ) .",
    "the o(2)@xmath0o(@xmath1 ) theory ( [ lgwh ] ) has been much studied using field - theoretical ( ft ) methods .",
    "different perturbative schemes have been exploited , such as the @xmath16 expansion @xcite and the three - dimensional ( 3-@xmath17 ) massive zero - momentum ( mzm ) renormalization scheme @xcite .",
    "a detailed discussion of the scenario emerging from the @xmath4 expansion is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . near four dimensions a stable o(2)@xmath0o(@xmath1 )",
    "fixed point ( fp ) with @xmath18 is found @xcite only for large values of @xmath1 , @xmath19 .",
    "resummations of the @xmath4 expansion of @xmath20 , known to @xmath21 @xcite , suggest @xcite @xmath22 in three dimensions .",
    "therefore , a _ smooth extrapolation _ of the scenario around @xmath23 to @xmath24 would indicate that a new o(2)@xmath0o(@xmath1 ) universality class does not exist for the physically interesting cases @xmath5 and 3 . on the other hand ,",
    "six - loop calculations in the framework of the 3-@xmath17 mzm scheme provide a rather robust evidence for the existence of a new stable fp for @xmath5 and @xmath6 with attraction domain in the region @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this fp was found only in the analysis of high - order series , starting at four loops , while earlier lower - order calculations up to three loops @xcite did not find it .",
    "according to renormalization - group ( rg ) theory , the stable fp of the o(2)@xmath0o(@xmath1 ) theory should describe the critical behavior of 3-@xmath17 systems undergoing continuous transitions characterized by the symmetry - breaking pattern o(2)@xmath0o(@xmath1)@xmath2o(2)@xmath0o(@xmath3 ) .",
    "the main problem of the calculations within the mzm scheme is the fact that , for @xmath5 and 3 , the o(2)@xmath0o(@xmath1 ) fp is found in a region of quartic couplings in which the perturbative expansions are not borel summable .",
    "therefore , a borel transformation only provides an asymptotic expansion and convergence is not guaranteed , at variance with the case of o(@xmath1 ) theories in which the borel summability of the corresponding mzm expansion provides a solid theoretical basis for the resummation methods . in the case of the o(2)@xmath0o(@xmath1 ) theory the reliability of the results concerning the new stable fp is essentially verified _ a posteriori _ from their stability with respect to the perturbative order .",
    "the mzm expansions have also been analyzed by using the pseudo-@xmath4 expansion method @xcite .",
    "no stable fp is found for @xmath5 and 3 , but this is not unexpected since this resummation method can only find fps that are already present at one loop , similarly to the @xmath4 expansion .",
    "we finally mention that perturbative studies of the corresponding nonlinear @xmath25 models near two dimensions have been reported in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we mention that there are other physically interesting cases in which low - order @xmath4-expansion calculations fail to provide the correct physical picture : for example , the ginzburg - landau model of superconductors , in which a complex scalar field couples to a gauge field .",
    "although @xmath4-expansion calculations do not find a stable fp @xcite , thus predicting first - order transitions , it is now well established ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) that 3-@xmath17 systems described by the ginzburg - landau model can also undergo a continuous transition  this implies the presence of a stable fp in the 3-@xmath17 ginzburg - landau theory  in agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "the o(2)@xmath0o(@xmath1 ) theory has also been studied by exploiting an alternative ft method based on the analysis of the rg flow of the so - called effective average action  @xcite .",
    "this approach does not rely on a perturbative expansion around the gaussian fp and it is therefore intrinsically nonperturbative .",
    "however , the practical implementation requires approximations and truncations of the average effective action . for this purpose , a derivative expansion of the effective average action",
    "is usually performed .",
    "the studies of the o(2)@xmath0o(@xmath1 ) theory reported in the literature  @xcite , based on the zeroth- and first - order approximations , do not find evidence of stable o(2)@xmath0o(@xmath1 ) fps for @xmath5 and 3 , in contradiction with the perturbative mzm results .",
    "this would imply that phase transitions characterized by the symmetry - breaking pattern o(2)@xmath0o(@xmath1)@xmath2o(2)@xmath0o(@xmath3 ) with @xmath5 or 3 are always of first order .",
    "the issue concerning the existence of o(2)@xmath0o(@xmath1 ) universality classes is most important to understand the physics of sta s and of magnets with helical order , because the absence of stable o(2)@xmath0o(@xmath1 ) fps implies that none of them can undergo a continuous transition . on the experimental side ,",
    "experiments @xcite have apparently observed continuous transitions belonging to the o(2)@xmath0o(@xmath1 ) universality class .",
    "however , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , experimental results are not consistent  sta s and helimagnets show a critical behavior with apparently different exponents  and , in some cases , do not satisfy general exponent inequalities , for instance @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the most recent monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of the antiferromagnetic xy hamiltonian on a stacked triangular lattice have observed a first - order transition @xcite with very small latent heat .",
    "moreover , first - order transitions have been observed in mc investigations  @xcite of modified lattice spin systems whose transitions are characterized by the same symmetry - breaking pattern . therefore , mc simulations of the models considered up to now do not support the existence of an o(2)@xmath0o(2 ) universality class . on the other hand ,",
    "mc simulations of heisenberg sta models , corresponding to @xmath6 , give results that are substantially consistent with a continuous transition , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we would like to stress that the existence of a universality class is not contradicted by the observation of first - order transitions in some systems sharing the same symmetry - breaking pattern .",
    "the universality class determines the critical behavior only if the system undergoes a continuous transition . instead",
    ", first - order transitions are expected for systems that are outside the attraction domain of the stable fp .",
    "this is evident in mean - field calculations and also within the ft approach , in which some rg trajectories do not flow towards the stable fp but run away to infinity .",
    "therefore , the above - mentioned mc results for the xy sta models are still compatible with the hypothesis of the existence of an o(2)@xmath0o(2 ) universality class ; xy sta models may be simply outside the attraction domain of the stable fp .    in this paper",
    "we further investigate the existence of the o(2)@xmath0o(@xmath1 ) universality class for xy ( @xmath5 ) and heisenberg ( @xmath6 ) systems .",
    "first , we consider an alternative 3-@xmath17 perturbative approach , the so - called minimal - subtraction ( @xmath28 ) scheme without @xmath4 expansion @xcite , for which five - loop series have been recently computed in ref .",
    "this scheme is strictly related to the @xmath4 expansion , but , unlike it , no @xmath4 expansion is performed and @xmath4 is set to the physical value @xmath29 , providing a 3-@xmath17 scheme .",
    "it works within the massless critical theory , thus providing a nontrivial check of the results obtained within the mzm scheme , which is defined in the massive disordered phase .",
    "the analysis of the corresponding five - loop expansions shows the existence of an o(2)@xmath0o(@xmath1 ) fp for @xmath5 and 3 , confirming the conclusions of the analysis of the six - loop expansions within the mzm scheme .",
    "concerning the critical exponents , the analysis of the five - loop @xmath28 series gives @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath5 , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath6 .",
    "these results should be compared with the estimates obtained from the six - loop mzm series , which are @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath5 , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 for @xmath6 .",
    "it is important to note that , although the available @xmath28 series have one order less , the corresponding results are expected to be more reliable than the mzm ones , because the @xmath28 fps are at the boundary of the region in which the expansions are borel summable , and not outside it as in the mzm case .",
    "we finally mention that the @xmath28 scheme without @xmath4 expansion allows us to obtain fixed - dimension results at any @xmath17 .",
    "thus , we are able to recover the results of the @xmath4 expansion sufficiently close to four dimensions and to obtain a full picture of the fate of the different fps as @xmath17 varies from four to three dimensions .",
    "we also address numerically the question of identifying a 3-@xmath17 lattice model with symmetry o(2)@xmath0o(2 ) and with the expected symmetry - breaking pattern that shows a continuous transition .",
    "this would conclusively show that the o(2)@xmath0o(2 ) universality class really exists .",
    "for this purpose we consider the following lattice model @xmath38 + 2 a_{22 } \\sum_x \\varphi_x^2 \\psi_x^2 , \\label{hli } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are two - component real variables .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath41 describes two identical two - component o(2)-symmetric lattice @xmath42 models coupled by an energy - energy term . by an appropriate change of variables ,",
    "see sec .",
    "[ secmc ] , one can show that model ( [ hli ] ) corresponds to a lattice discretization of the hamiltonian ( [ lgwh ] ) for @xmath5 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "when @xmath45 the critical behavior at the phase transition should be described by the @xmath5 hamiltonian ( [ lgwh ] ) with @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , a region of continuous transitions in the quartic parameter space with @xmath46 would imply the existence of the o(2)@xmath0o(2 ) universality class . in order to investigate this point ,",
    "we present mc simulations for @xmath47 and several values of @xmath48 .",
    "the phase diagram emerging from the simulations is characterized by a line of first - order transitions extending from large values of @xmath48 down to a tricritical point at @xmath49 , where the latent heat vanishes , and , for @xmath50 , by a line of continuous transitions that should belong to the o(2)@xmath0o(2 ) universality class identified by the perturbative ft approaches .",
    "the possible extension of the first - order transition line up to @xmath51 , i.e. up to the 4-vector theory , is apparently incompatible with the theoretically predicted behavior of the latent heat near an o(4 ) tricritical point .",
