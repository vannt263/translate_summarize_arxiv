    "the most commonly used optical emission - line diagnostic for separating star - forming galaxies from type ii active galatic nuclei ( agns ) relies on [ oiii]@xmath9/h@xmath0 versus [ nii]@xmath3/h@xmath1 ( hereafter , bpt diagram  * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the basic idea is that the emission lines in star - forming galaxies are powered by massive stars , so there is a well - defined upper limit on the intensities of the collisionally excited lines relative to the recombination lines ( such as h@xmath1 or h@xmath0 ) .",
    "in contrast , agns are powered by a source of far more energetic photons , making the collisionally excited lines more intense relative to the recombination lines .",
    "two demarcations are commonly used for identifying agn - dominated galaxies versus star formation dominated galaxies  ( 1 ) the @xcite theoretical division between galaxies whose extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) ionizing radiation field is dominated by an agn ( @xmath10% ) and those dominated by star formation and ( 2 ) the @xcite empirical demarcation based on the location of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) star - forming galaxies .",
    "galaxies that lie between these two curves are often referred to as composite galaxies .",
    "hereafter , we refer to these categories as bpt - agn , bpt - sf , and bpt - comp .    the bpt diagram is limited in its use with optical spectra to galaxies with @xmath2 ( the redshift at which [ nii ] leaves the optical spectral window ) .",
    "a number of groups have tried to extend optical emission line diagnostics to higher redshifts by only using lines at the blue end of the spectrum .",
    "@xcite replaced [ nii]/h@xmath1 with [ oii]@xmath11/h@xmath0 , creating the ` blue diagram ' , which can be used to classify galaxies out to @xmath12 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they find that this diagnostic is very successful at identifying star - forming galaxies ( with @xmath13% of the bpt - sf still classified as sf - dominated ) but that it requires complementary diagnostics to robustly classify bpt - agn ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we also note that [ oii ] and h@xmath0 are relatively distant in wavelength , requiring more careful calibration and extinction corrections .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite introduced the cex and mex diagnostics , respectively , in which they replaced [ nii]/h@xmath1 with rest - frame @xmath14 color ( cex ) or with stellar mass ( mex ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "both diagnostics recover the bpt - agn classification very well , with 95.7% and @xmath13% of the bpt - agn still classified as agns in the cex and mex diagnostics , respectively .",
    "however , because these diagnostics rely on h@xmath0 at @xmath15   , their use with optical spectra is limited to @xmath16 .    at higher redshifts",
    "the @xcite dew diagnostic , based on @xmath17 $ ] , [ neiii]@xmath5 , and [ oii ] ( see also @xcite ) , can be used with optical spectra out to @xmath7 , at which point the lines move into the infrared .",
    "while these emission lines are not as strong as [ oiii ] and h@xmath0 , their ratio is the only choice for pushing optical spectra to these higher redshifts .",
    "[ neiii ] emission indicates the presence of highly ionized gas and is much stronger than [ oii ] in high - excitation agns .",
    "however , because @xmath17 $ ] requires a sufficiently high signal - to - noise continuum ( i.e. , using sdss , we find that the uncertainty on @xmath17 $ ] ranges from 5% at @xmath18  @xmath19 to 25% at @xmath18  @xmath20 ; see also @xcite ) and requires the survey to be spectrophotometrically calibrated , its usage with distant galaxies is limited .    in this article",
    "we examine whether rest - frame @xmath4 color , which requires near - infrared imaging at the higher redshifts , is a compelling replacement for @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "while the ratio of [ neiii]/[oii ] alone effectively separates metal - rich star - forming galaxies from agns , metal - poor star - forming galaxies have high values of [ neiii]/[oii ] ( as a result of less line blanketing enabling a harder stellar radiation field ) .",
    "fortunately , metal - poor galaxies also tend to be bluer ( see fig .  7 in @xcite )",
    ", so we can use their color to distinguish them from agns ( which tend to be bulge dominated and redder , see @xcite ) .",
    "we refer to this new diagnostic as the tbt diagram .",
    "we first establish the reliability of the tbt diagnostic in reproducing the bpt classifications at low redshifts using sdss , the largest spectroscopic sample to date of emission - line galaxies .",
    "we then test the tbt diagnostic at higher redshifts using the highly spectroscopically complete optx x - ray selected sample of agns @xcite .",
    "the misidentification of x - ray selected agns as sf - dominated galaxies is a potential issue for all optical emission - line diagnostic diagrams .",
    "in @xcite we found that @xmath21% of the @xmath22  erg  s@xmath23  _ chandra _ x - ray selected agns in our optx sample that have [ oiii ] , h@xmath0 , [ nii ] , and h@xmath1 fluxes with signal - to - noise greater than five are misidentified by the bpt diagram as bpt - sf ( see also @xcite for evidence of this in the _ swift _ bat sample and @xcite for evidence of this in the xmm - cosmos sample ) .",
    "existing high - redshift optical emission - line diagnostics also misidentify a significant fraction of x - ray selected agns , e.g. , @xmath24% and @xmath25% of x - ray selected agns in the mex and cex diagrams lie in the mex - sf and cex - sf regimes , respectively .",
    "stacking techniques have been widely used in x - ray astronomy to study the average properties of source populations selected to have certain well - defined properties and which are too x - ray faint to be detected individually ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "deep field north ( cdfn ; @xcite ) imaging to determine whether they are , on average , x - ray soft or x - ray hard .",
    "an x - ray hard source is indicative of obscured agn activity or the presence of high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) associated with ongoing star formation .",
    "an x - ray soft source is indicative of unobscured agn activity or the presence of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) associated with old stellar populations . in order to distinguish between these scenarios , we perform an infrared ( ir ) stacking analysis using the _ spitzer space telescope _",

    "we compare the x - ray and ir luminosities for our stacked tbt - sf and stacked tbt - agn with the results from these studies to verify the dominance of star formation activity in the former and agn activity in the latter .",
    "we then perform x - ray and ir stacking analyses of the bpt categories to confirm the presence of agn activity in bpt - comp , as suggested by the tbt diagnostic . in most optical emission - line diagnostics ,",
    "the bpt - comp lie in a transition region or within the sf - dominated regime .",

    "five of these are obvious x - ray selected agns with @xmath22  . of the six x - ray detected sources with @xmath117  , three are only detected in the @xmath119 band . using the @xmath35 flux limit for their _ chandra _ image ( see table [ table_fluxlim ] ) , we determine an upper limit to their hardness ratios and find that all three are x - ray soft , with @xmath164 .",
    "the remaining three sources are detected in both bands and are x - ray hard , with @xmath166 .    after excluding known x - ray sources , as well as coincidental contaminants , we use the stackfast program to determine the average x - ray signal in the remaining 76 bpt - comp .",
    "the stacked source is significantly detected in both bands ( @xmath201 in the @xmath210 band and @xmath167 in the @xmath35 band ) .",
    "we find a @xmath211 , i.e. , the source is x - ray hard .    our mc simulations for the bpt - comp yield a 5% probability that we would see the observed @xmath119 flux and a 2% probability we would see the observed @xmath35 flux , confirming that we are recovering a real signal in both bands . fewer than @xmath212% of our mc simulations for the bpt - comp result in both the @xmath119 and @xmath35 bands detected at a @xmath46 level or greater . in other words , there is a @xmath97% false - alarm rate for our stacked bpt - comp signal .",
    "thus , the observed x - ray hardness in our bpt - comp appears to be a reliable result .      as discussed in section [ irstack ] , the x - ray hard signal in our stacked bpt - comp could be due either to hmxbs or to agn activity with obscuration .",
    "we follow the same procedure as in section [ irstack ] to distinguish between these scenarios using the ir .",
    "we determine the @xmath80 error on @xmath183 for the stacked bpt - comp ( gray open diamond ) by propagating the errors on both the stacked x - ray and ir signal .",

    "this corroborates what we find for the individually x - ray detected bpt - comp ( gray filled diamonds ) , where the majority ( 8/11 ) have @xmath183 values well above the expected range for pure star - forming galaxies .",

    "the two with @xmath214 lie within the expected range for pure star - forming galaxies .",

    "similarly , in the mex diagnostic @xcite , only 17% of bpt - comp lie within the mex - sf regime .    a number of optical emission - line studies have argued that the signal in bpt - comp is dominated by star formation activity , rather than agn activity . the @xcite upper boundary to the bpt - comp regime marks their theoretical prediction for galaxies whose contribution from agn activity to the extreme ultraviolet ionizing radiation field just begins to exceed 50% .",
    "according to this work , all sources to the lower - left of this boundary have their signal dominated by star formation activity .",
    "similarly , @xcite use spectral synthesis modeling to argue that the contribution from agn activity to the emission - line signal in bpt - comp is 20% or less .",
    "furthermore , @xcite note that bpt - comp lie in the same parameter space as hii regions in the [ oiii]/[oii ] versus [ oi]/h@xmath1 diagnostic ( as well as within the sf - dominated regime of the [ oiii]/h@xmath0 vs. [ sii]/h@xmath1 diagnostic ) .",
    "they argue that this provides further support for the idea that the ionizing radiation field and ionization parameter in bpt - comp are dominated by star formation activity .    here",
    "we argue that our tbt diagnostic s reliance on [ neiii ] , with its higher ionization potential than [ oiii ] , [ nii ] , or [ sii ] , leads to a more reliable identification of agn - dominated sources . in section [ stackbpt ] we tested whether the inclusion of the majority of bpt - comp in our tbt - agn regime was justified . of the individually x - ray detected bpt - comp , 70% are x - ray hard with @xmath183 ratios indicative of dominance by agn activity ( see figure [ stackbpt ] ) .",
    "the stacked signal from x - ray undetected bpt - comp is also x - ray hard and exhibits an @xmath183 ratio @xmath184 above the expected range for pure star - forming galaxies .",
    "this supports our tbt diagnostic inclusion of bpt - comp in the tbt - agn regime and suggests that , on average , the x - ray and optical signal in bpt - comp is dominated by agn activity .",
    "we have shown that the tbt diagnostic  rest - frame  color versus [ neiii]/[oii ]  reliably separates sdss sf - dominated sources from agn - dominated sources , as classified according to the classic bpt diagram . because both [ neiii ] and [ oii ] are located in the blue end of the optical spectrum , we are able to classify galaxies using this diagnostic out to @xmath62 .",
    "the tbt diagnostic provides a significant extension in redshift compared to the bpt diagram ( limited in its use with optical spectra to @xmath2 ) and the more recent [ oiii]/h@xmath0-based diagnostics ( limited to @xmath12  ` blue diagram ' , @xcite , @xcite ; cex , @xcite ; mex , @xcite ) .",
    "we find that the tbt selection of agns matches well with an x - ray selection of agns , with 97% ( 100/103 ) of our optx x - ray selected agns lying within the tbt - agn regime .",
    "this suggests that the tbt diagnostic is more reliable than the bpt diagnostic in identifying x - ray selected agns , since the bpt diagnostic misidentifies @xmath21% of of our optx x - ray selected agns as bpt - sf , i.e. , as star - forming galaxies .",
    "this may be a result of the higher ionization potential of the [ neiii ] line ( 63.45 ev ) as compared with the [ oiii ] line ( 54.94 ev ) .",
    "the higher ionization potential appears to foster a more reliable selection of agn - dominated galaxies , i.e. , the weaker ionizing flux in star - forming galaxies lessens their ability to excite [ neiii ] as compared to [ oiii ] .",
    "we perform x - ray and ir stacking analyses of the goods - n sample of galaxies with accompanying deep _ chandra _ imaging to verify the dominance of agn activity in our tbt - agn and star formation activity in our tbt - sf .",
    "we find that the tbt - agn , on average , are x - ray hard with @xmath224 above the expected range for pure star - forming galaxies .",
    "their x - ray hardness and excess x - ray signal is likely due to obscured or weak agn activity .",
    "the tbt - sf , on the other hand , are x - ray soft with @xmath183 consistent with pure star - forming galaxies .",
    "we perform the same stacking analyses on the bpt categories in order to confirm the selection of the majority of bpt - comp as tbt - agn . as expected , the bpt - sf are x - ray soft with @xmath183 consistent with pure star - forming galaxies and the bpt - agn are x - ray hard with @xmath224 above the expected range for pure star - forming galaxies . of the individually x - ray detected bpt - comp , 70% are x - ray hard with @xmath183 ratios indicative of dominance by agn activity .",
    "our stacked bpt - comp is significantly detected in both the @xmath119 and @xmath35 bands and is x - ray hard , with @xmath225 .",
    "furthermore , the stacked bpt - comp @xmath213 is @xmath184 above the expected range for pure star - forming galaxies .",
    "these findings support our tbt diagnostic inclusion of bpt - comp in the tbt - agn regime .    the bpt - comp ( individual and stacked ) properties suggest that , on average , both their x - ray and optical signal is dominated by obscured or weak agn activity .",
    "this is in contrast to claims by previous optical emission - line studies that the signal in bpt - comp is dominated by star formation activity .",
    "therefore , we recommend that groups carefully consider the impact of excluding or including bpt - comp on the interpretation of their results .",
    "for example , for studies involving determining the bolometric contribution from agn activity or the role of agn activity in galaxy evolution , we advise maximal inclusiveness .",
    "since bpt - comp comprise a significant percentage of the overall emission - line galaxy population ( 20% of the sdss dr8 sample ) , inclusion of the bpt - comp would provide a more comprehensive picture of the true impact of agn activity in these studies .    on the other hand , for metallicity studies of star - forming galaxies , we advise maximal conservativeness ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "emission lines like [ oiii ] are boosted by agn activity and can masquerade as indicators of low metallicity , leading to the misinterpretation of results .",
    "therefore , in this case , it is optimal to use a diagnostic that reliably excludes all agns and agn / sf composites .",
