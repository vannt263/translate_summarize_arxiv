    "the unusual features of spin dynamics in spin - polarized quantum systems have been intensively studied since the pioneering paper of leggett and rice  @xcite on spin diffusion in normal liquid @xmath8 .",
    "the main effect arises from the observation that the presence of a molecular field ( induced by the applied magnetic field ) leads to an additional precession of the spin - current which in steady state acquires a component perpendicular to the magnetization gradient ; through the continuity equation this results in an anomalous reactive component ( damped spin - wave ) to spin transport .",
    "spin - rotation \" effect is also present in the case of spin - polarized boltzmann gases  @xcite .    from a microscopic point of view",
    ", it was expected that a number of qualitatively novel phenomena might arise in the case of sufficiently high polarizations  @xcite .",
    "a natural suggestion , made by meyerovich  @xcite , was that low - temperature spin - diffusion becomes highly anisotropic for finite polarizations .",
    "more precisely , processes involving spin - flips make use of the phase - space volume between the two distinct fermi surfaces ( for  up \" and  down \" spins ) leading to a _ finite _ scattering rate in the limit of @xmath9 .",
    "this is in contrast with processes involving scattering in the vicinity of each of the fermi surfaces which are subject to the phase - space restrictions of unpolarized fermi liquids and are thus characterized by the conventional fermi - liquid behaviour of scattering rates , @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "meyerovich s suggestion was recently supported by measurements of the transverse spin - diffusion coefficient in weakly polarized liquid @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , @xmath11 was calculated in the dilute gas limit at @xmath12  @xcite ; while for @xmath13 the only available estimates are based on a variational solution of the boltzmann equation  @xcite , or on a phenomenological mathiessen - type rule @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present the analytical calculation of the finite temperature behaviour of @xmath11 for a dilute fermi gas in the s - wave approximation , by solving the appropriate kinetic equations exactly . while at @xmath14 our results for @xmath11 agree with those of previous work @xcite , in the opposite case of @xmath15 the exact solution of kinetic equation results in a qualitatively new behaviour of @xmath11 .",
    "we show , that the crossover between the high - field and low - field behaviours is described by _ two _ dimensionless parameters rather than only one as implied in refs .",
    "@xcite : the first is the ratio @xmath16 , which determines whether the phase space that is available for interparticle scattering is due to the field - induced splitting of the fermi spheres ( @xmath17 ) or to the temperature smearing of the fermi distribution function ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is , roughly speaking , inversely proportional to the square of the available phase space volume ; and hence in the two limits we obtain @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the second parameter , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is the @xmath0-wave scattering length and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are fermi energy and momentum in the absence of magnetic field ) is the ratio of two frequency scales appearing in the kinetic equations for transverse spin diffusion , @xmath24 .",
    "the scale @xmath25 is determined by the thermal term in the transverse relaxation rate , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is particle mass ; while @xmath28 is the molecular field contribution to the precession frequency of the transverse spin current .",
    "( its origin is the spin - dependent exchange scattering amplitude of two particles interacting through a spin - independent interparticle potential  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath29 measures the number of oscillations of the spin current during a collision time .",
    "for @xmath30 the  spin - rotation \" effect strongly affects the spin diffusion process , which remains anisotropic even for @xmath31 : in this case , we obtain @xmath32 .",
    "the crossover to isotropic behaviour occurs for @xmath33 , so that @xmath34 only once @xmath35 .",
    "we note that the crossover between isotropic and anisotropic behaviours of @xmath36 at @xmath33 has already been discussed previously @xcite",
    ". however , the qualitative changes in the collision integral which occur at @xmath37 were overlooked .",
    "similarly , the subtleties that arise in the solution of boltzmann equation at @xmath38 have not been noticed in refs .",
    "@xcite , which however provide the correct results for @xmath30 . in the present paper",
    ", we will give the complete description of field and temperature dependence of @xmath11 for a dilute gas ( within the @xmath0-wave approximation for the two - body scattering ) which is valid for _ any _ value of @xmath39 provided that the gas remains degenerate for both values of spin projection , @xmath40 where @xmath41 are the fermi momenta for spin - up and spin - down particles : @xmath42 @xmath43 are the numbers of spin - up and spin - down particles per unit volume , @xmath44 is the longitudinal magnetization per unit volume induced by the field @xmath39 , and @xmath45 is the density of the gas .",
    "a short account of the present work was already published in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we emphasize that throughout this paper we concentrate on the hydrodynamic regime defined by _",
    "finite _ longitudinal and transverse relaxation times , @xmath46 , which , in principle , satisfy the condition @xmath47 , where @xmath48 ( @xmath49 is the size of the system ) is the characteristic wavevector of magnetization fluctuations .",
    "the @xmath9 limit of our calculations leads to different physics from that of the strict @xmath12 , collisionless regime discussed by i. a. fomin @xcite .",
    "indeed , one should interpret our @xmath12 results as describing fluctuations with sufficiently long wavelength , and at low _ but finite _ temperatures , @xmath50 , such that the hydrodynamic condition is satisfied ( note that @xmath51 and @xmath52 diverge at @xmath53 ) .",
    "the interesting issue of the validity of the linearized boltzmann equation approach in the context of spin - polarized fermi gases at low temperatures , raised in refs .",
    "@xcite , is left for future investigations . here , we limit ourselves to the linearized equations , which should be valid even for @xmath50 as long as the external probe used to drive the system out of equilibrium is weak enough and sufficiently slowly varying in space .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : zerot ] we discuss the zero temperature limit of the kinetic equations derived more generally in appendix [ app : kinetics ] . to get a better feeling for the physical content of these equations we begin with an analysis of the relaxation time approximation .",
    "we then solve the @xmath53 equations exactly and recover the variational result of ref .",
    "this is followed in section [ sec : smallpol ] with the discussion of the finite temperature equations in the limit of small polarization , @xmath54 , and the resulting exact solution for the diffusion coefficient . since the results of section",
