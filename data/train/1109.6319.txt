    "the identification of a large sample of field l  and t  dwarfs over the last @xmath615  years has progressed from individual discoveries to large samples of hundreds of objects . yet in contrast to the tremendous advances made in spectral classification ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , accurate determination of the physical properties of ultracool dwarfs remains an unfulfilled goal .",
    "one inherent difficulty originates from the fundamental nature of substellar objects . in the absence of sustained internal energy generation , the temperatures , luminosities , and radii for substellar objects of a given mass steadily decline with age",
    " thus diagnosing physical properties from photometry and spectroscopy is more complicated than for main - sequence stars , which maintain much more constant properties over their lifetimes .",
    "in addition , theoretical modeling of emergent fluxes and spectra at such low effective temperatures ( @xmath72500  k ) is challenged by uncertainties in the treatment of dust , clouds , molecules , and chemistry .    to help overcome these difficulties , the rare subset of brown dwarfs known as `` benchmarks ''",
    "is highly valued .",
    "this designation is commonly used for any brown dwarf with some physical properties much better constrained compared to field objects . given that three fundamental quantities ( e.g. , luminosity , temperature , and age ) are needed to primarily determine a brown dwarf s physical state ( ignoring metallicity )",
    ", a sharper definition would be any object for which two fundamental quantities are well - constrained .",
    "as described in @xcite , substellar benchmarks can be naturally distinguished into `` mass benchmarks '' and `` age benchmarks '' , where the mass or age , respectively , are well - constrained .",
    "mass benchmarks are ultracool binaries with directly determined distances ( and hence luminosities ) and dynamical masses . in these binaries , the remaining main properties ( temperature and surface gravity )",
    "can be very precisely constrained using evolutionary models .",
    "however , given the long orbital timescales ( @xmath810  yr ) , the current sample of mass benchmarks for the l  and t  spectral classes is limited to five systems ( e.g. see compilation in @xcite ) .",
    "ample age benchmarks at hotter temperatures ( spectral types of late - m to early - l ) have been found in young ( @xmath71100  myr ) clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the distances and stellar ages are very well - known , and thus the luminosites and ages of the brown dwarfs are as well .",
    "however , open clusters with ages comparable to the field population ( @xmath8gyr ) are largely dynamically depleted of substellar objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the search for field benchmarks has largely focused on brown dwarfs found as companions to stars ( e.g. , see compilation in @xcite ) . in this case",
    ", the ages of the primary stars can also be attributed to their brown dwarf companions , though their typical age uncertainties lead to poorer constraints compared to brown dwarfs in short - period binaries or open clusters .",
    "three t - dwarf companions have been found at small angular separations through adaptive optics imaging , including the archetype gl  229b @xcite , gj  758b @xcite , and scr  1845@xmath96357b @xcite .",
    "nine other t  dwarfs have been found at much wider separations around main - sequence stars from wide - field survey data : gl  570d @xcite , hd  3651b @xcite , hn  pegb@xcite , wolf  940b @xcite , ross  458c @xcite , hip  63510c @xcite , hip  73786b ( @xcite , @xcite ) , @xmath2  indi  bab @xcite , gl  337cd @xcite . @xcite",
    "identify cfbds j022644@xmath9062522 as a possible wide companion to hd15220 but while the secondary s spectroscopic parallax places it at a similar distance to the primary , the proper motion determination on the secondary is currently not accurate enough to confirm companionship .",
    "additionally , lspm 1459 + 0857b @xcite and wd  0806@xmath9661b @xcite have been identified as wide companions to white dwarfs , the latter of which is much cooler than any known t  dwarfs but has not yet been spectrally classified .",
    "wide - field surveys represent fertile ground for identifying benchmarks .",
    "most wide benchmark companions have resulted from large - area searches for free - floating ultracool dwarfs , which are then realized to be comoving with higher mass stars .",
    "more limited efforts have been carried out to expressly identify wide benchmarks around well - defined samples of primary stars @xcite . with a sufficiently large sample of benchmarks",
    ", it may be possible to provide a direct empirical calibration that ties the underlying physical parameters ( e.g. , age and temperature ) to observable brown dwarf properties ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "to this end , the pan - starrs1 ( ps1 ) telescope @xcite is a welcome addition to help boost the census of benchmark brown dwarfs .",
    "situated on the summit of haleakal on the island of maui in the hawaiian islands , ps1 will be the leading multi - epoch optical survey facility over the next several years .",
    "ps1 is the first of four planned 1.8-meter telescopes that will comprise the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( @xcite ) .",
    "full science operations with ps1 began in may 2010 , and fabrication of the second telescope ( ps2 ) has already begun .",
    "so far , commissioning and regular survey data have been used to search for trans - neptunian objects ( @xcite ) , t  dwarfs ( @xcite , @xcite ) and supernovae ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the telescope is executing several astronomical surveys of varying depth , area , cadence , and filter complements .",
    "the most interesting of these for discovering free - floating and companion brown dwarfs is the 3@xmath10 survey , which is scanning the entire sky north of @xmath11 ( 3@xmath10 steradians ) in five filters ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; @xcite , @xcite in prep . ) at six separate epochs over 3.5  years , with each epoch consisting of pairs of exposures taken @xmath625  min apart .",
    "these multiple epochs and the use of the 0.95 - 1.03  @xmath16 band make the survey well - suited for identifying nearby cool objects such as brown dwarfs by their proper motions and parallaxes ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    in this paper , we present the discovery of a t4.5  dwarf around the k4v  star hip  38939 found from a dedicated search for wide late - l and t dwarf companions using the ps1 and 2mass . in   2 , we describe our mining of these datasets to search for companions to main - sequence stars with proper motions from hipparcos .",
    "spectroscopic confirmation is presented in   3 . in   4 we examine the physical properties of our new discovery , along with a look at the total compilation of benchmark t  dwarfs now known .",
    "pan - starrs1 began full survey operations in may 2010 . hence for a given filter and location on the sky , the current 3@xmath10 survey data consist of only one pair of images taken at the same epoch or multiple pairs separated by a short time baseline .",
    "so we can use these data for studies of nearby brown dwarfs , we have undertaken a proper motion survey by combining ps1 data with those from 2mass  @xcite .",
    "this method was used to identify new t dwarfs in @xcite .",
    "we constructed a database of high proper motion objects containing all ps1 3@xmath10 survey commissioning and survey data taken from the beginning of february 2010 to the end of january 2011 .",
    "this was done by identifying ps1 @xmath16 objects with no 2mass detection within one arcsecond .",
    "we required that the ps1 object was detected on at least two images , was classified as a good quality point source detection , and had a photometric error less than 0.2 magnitudes in the @xmath16 band .",
    "the double detection requirement excludes contamination due to asteroids and reduces the number of instrumental artefacts .",
    "these objects are then paired with 2mass @xmath17-band point sources which had an a , b or c photometric quality flag designation ( corresponding to s / n@xmath185 ) , which were within 28@xmath19 and which had no corresponding ps1 detection .",
    "this pairing radius was chosen to allow the detection of objects with proper motions up to 2@xmath19/yr given the 14-year maximum epoch difference between ps1 and 2mass .    to identify companion objects to nearby stars , we ran queries on our proper motion database around all stars in the hipparcos catalogue @xcite .",
    "we chose stars with proper motions above 0.1@xmath19/yr and parallaxes more significant than @xmath20 .",
    "we searched for companions with projected separations less than 10,000 au at the distance of the hipparcos star .",
    "each candidate was further filtered to have proper motion vectors within @xmath20 of the primary assuming a nominal accuracy of 16 milliarcseconds per year in each coordinate for our proper motions and errors from @xcite for the primary .",
    "we then picked out candidate ultracool dwarfs using the color selections found in @xcite which are sensitive to late - l and t dwarfs .",
    "these are @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 with no corresponding @xmath24 or @xmath25 band detections in supercosmos @xcite or usno - b @xcite brighter than 20.5 and 18.5 magnitudes respectively .",
    "no galactic latitude cut was applied .",
    "taking into account area lost due to gaps between chips in the ps1 camera and areas of multiple coverage where these gaps can be filled in , we searched 16,900 sq.deg . after examining 1008 candidates by eye to remove spurious associations and objects with clear but uncatalogued companions in the usno - b photographic plate images 380 candidates remained .",
    "of these , our clearest late - type candidate was a companion to hip  38939 ( a.k.a .",
    "cd-25  5342 , gj  9246 , hd  65486 , nltt  18729 , sao  174889 ) .",
    "we have not yet completely followed up our remaining candidates , hence this work to date should not be considered a complete survey for late - type companions to hipparcos stars .",
    "details of the companion are shown in table  [ details ] .",
    "its proper motion is a good match to that of the primary , differing by 1.5@xmath26 . at the distance to the primary ( 18.5@xmath40.4 pc ; @xcite ) the angular separation of 88 arcseconds means a projected separation of 1630 au .",
    "finder charts are shown in figure  [ stamps ] .",
    "the relatively dense field is due to the low galactic latitude of hip  38939 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "this explains why the object has gone undiscovered until now , as most brown dwarf surveys have avoided the galactic plane .",

    "the probability of a random object having the same proper motion as hip  38939a was estimated by taking objects from our high - speed pan - starrs1 - 2mass catalogue within one degree of the primary and estimating what fraction had a similar proper motion to the primary .",

    "the most current age - activity - rotation relation is that of @xcite which unfortunately does not apply to stars redder than @xmath75 . using the earlier relation of @xcite we derive an age of 870 myr .",
    "@xcite estimates a spread of @xmath76 dex for the age of the sun from a single measurement of the chromospheric activity at any point across the solar cycle .",
    "this value is consistent with the results for younger , coeval binaries and is larger than the intrinsic variability of 13% quoted by @xcite for their @xmath69 values .",
