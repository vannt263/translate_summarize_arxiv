    "since the rise of fractal theory started with the first works of pioneer mandelbrot @xcite , the relevance of fractals in a wide range of scientific areas has increased during the last years .",
    "it is worth mentioning , in this occassion , the connection among fractals and dynamical systems .",
    "indeed , it is well known and established that fractal dimension provides a useful measure about the chaotic behavior of a given dynamical system .",
    "this bas been carried out classically through the box dimension ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* subsection 8.4 ) ) , mainly due to the easiness when being calculated or estimated in empirical applications , though the hausdorff dimension , which is the oldest and also the most accurate ( by definition ) model for fractal dimension has been considered , too , at least from a theoretical point of view .",
    "recently , novel alternatives , with some desirable analytical properties as it happens with the hausdorff dimension model , and being as easy to calculate as the box dimension , have been contributed . in particular , a new fractal dimension algorithm , specially appropriate to deal with time series , has allowed the authors to study the chaotic behavior of planar oscillations described by a satellite in the field of astrodynamics , based on a beletsky model @xcite . moreover ,",
    "also the hurst exponent ( resp .",
    "the self - similarity exponent ) turns into another serious candidate to tackle this task , and has been already explored as a chaos measure for dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "they provide alternative chaos measurements within the advantage to be less computationally expensive than classical lyapunov exponent .",
    "another interesting topic that fractal dimension allows to deal with is about the study of self - similar sets , which become a special kind of fractal sets which could be equipped in a quite natural way by a fractal structure ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 4.4 ) ) . to calculate the fractal dimension of this kind of fractals through a explicit formula constitutes a worth - mentioning task , and",
    "this has been explored previously through both the box - counting and the hausdorff fractal dimensions , though a certain restrictive hypothesis is required ( see @xcite ) .",
    "similar results in this line have been also contributed through novel definitions of fractal dimension specially developed for any fractal structure ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.19 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorems 4.19 & 4.20 , and corollary 4.22 ) ) . in particular ,",
    "one of such models allows to calculate the fractal dimension for self - similar sets ( equipped with their natural fractal structure ) with the open set condition not having to be satisfied ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 4.2 ) ) .    in this paper ,",
    "two notions for a self - similar set are explored .",
    "thus , a space being homeomorphic to any attractor of an iterated function systems is called a banach fractal , whereas a topological fractal basically consists of a space which is homeomorphic to a weak iterated function system ( namely , such an ifs is constructed through a finite set of weak contractive mappings ) .",
    "the main goal in the present work is to state that these concepts , though essential , are not equivalent in general .",
    "this is carried out through a collection of appropriately constructed counterexamples , as can be seen in forthcoming subsections [ sub:1 ] & [ sub:2 ] .",
    "in this section , some concepts regarding ( weak ) ifs - attractors , as well as banach and topological fractals , are firsly recalled and theoretically connected . moreover , in subsection [ sub:1 ] , three appropriately chosen counterexamples are provided in order to show that the reciprocal links are not true , in general . on the other hand ,",
    "subsection [ sub:2 ] allow the authors to point out that though no peano continuum not being a topological fractal is still known , scattered spaces do provide a topological context where many examples of this could be found .",
    "this is illustrated through a standard construction involving the cantor - bendixson derivative .",
    "for a metric space @xmath0 , let us define an ifs as a finite family @xmath1 of contractive self - maps ( with all the lipschitz constants , denoted by @xmath2 , being @xmath3 ) .",
    "the unique compact set @xmath4 which satisfies @xmath5 is called the attractor of the ifs @xmath1 or ifs - attractor .",
    "it is a standard fact from fractal theory that there exists an attractor for every ifs on a complete metric space @xmath6 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is a consequence of banach contraction principle .",
    "namely , the iterated function system @xmath1 generates a contractive operator @xmath7 acting on a ( complete ) space of nonempty , compact subsets of @xmath6 with the hausdorff metric .      by weak ifs on a metric space @xmath0",
    ", we understand a finite family @xmath1 of self - maps which are weak contractions , namely , it is satisfied that for every distinct points @xmath8 , and for all @xmath9 , it holds that @xmath10 .",
    "a compact set @xmath11 such that @xmath5 for such a family @xmath1 , will be named weak ifs - attractor .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 7.1 ) , it was proved that whether the space @xmath6 is compact , then there exists the attractor for every weak ifs on @xmath6 . in this paper , though , we will also consider spaces homeomorphic to attractors for ( weak ) ifs .",
    "these concepts are stated next .",
    "a hausdorff topological space @xmath6 is called a topological fractal provided that @xmath12 , where @xmath1 is a finite family of continuous self - maps such that for every open cover @xmath13 of the space @xmath6 , there exists @xmath14 such that for any maps @xmath15 , the set @xmath16 contains in some set @xmath17 .",
    "note that every compact metric space @xmath6 is a topological ifs - attractor whether for any of its open covers @xmath13 , the diameter of the set @xmath16 is less than the lebesgue number of @xmath13 , for some @xmath14 , and every @xmath15 .",
    "recall that the lebesgue number @xmath18 for an open cover @xmath13 of a compact metric space @xmath6 , is a positive real number , such that every subset of @xmath6 whose diameter is less than @xmath18 , is contained in some element of @xmath13 .",
    "surprisingly , it holds that a space is a topological fractal if and only if it is metrizable and homeomorphic to the attractor of some weak ifs .",
    "this result was recently proved in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 6.4 ) .    regarding the present work , next",
    "we will show that all the presented definitions , while essential , are not equivalent in general .",
    "indeed , it is easy to check the connections displayed in the following diagram : @xmath19\\ar@{=>}[d]&\\mbox{weak ifs - attractor}\\ar@{=>}[d]\\\\ \\mbox{banach fractal}\\ar@{=>}[r]&\\mbox{topological fractal}\\\\ } \\ ] ] though the inverse implications do not hold .",
    "we deal with in the upcoming subsections .",
    "firstly , to provide a description for the snake , let us switch to standard polar coordinates @xmath20 on @xmath21 , that is @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the snake consists of circular sectors @xmath23 and intervals @xmath24 , \\alpha= n\\bmod{2}\\cdot\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\bigg\\},\\ ] ] for @xmath25 .",
    "hence , the snake is defined as @xmath26 .",
    "this is an arc , namely , a space homeomorphic to the closed unit interval . since @xmath27 $ ] is a standard ifs - attractor , the snake becomes a banach fractal . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath28 has infinite length and satisfies the following theorem proved by sanders in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.1 ) :      * for all @xmath31 , the length of the subarc of @xmath11 with endpoints @xmath32 and @xmath33 is finite , and * for every @xmath34 , the length of the subarc of @xmath11 with endpoints @xmath32 and @xmath35 is infinite .",
    "let us clarify the notions consisting of endpoints as well as the length of an arc .",
    "indeed , take an arc @xmath36)$ ] , where @xmath37{\\longrightarrow}{\\mathbb{r}}^n$ ] is an embedding .",
    "the _ endpoints _ of the arc @xmath36)$ ] , are the points @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "furtherm , a _ partition _ of the interval @xmath27 $ ] is a finite sequence @xmath40 , such that @xmath41 .",

    "note that the length is independent of the choice of the embedding @xmath46 .",
    "note that theorem [ thm_sanders ] means that the space @xmath28 is not an attractor for any iterated function system .",
    "accordingly , to conclude the proof , we will show that the snake becomes an attractor for the weak ifs @xmath47 , where the functions @xmath48 do project the snake onto finite length intervals , which allow to cover parts of the space .",
    "we can even choose the functions @xmath49 being contractions , as well as in ( * ? ? ? *",
    "theorem 3.1 ) .",
    "moreover , the function @xmath50 has to fill the remaining part of the snake , which has infinite length .",
    "note that it scales down the modulus of points , namely @xmath51 where @xmath52 is defined as follows :      in fact , note that whether @xmath54 $ ] , then there exists @xmath55 $ ] such that @xmath56 .",
    "hence , @xmath57 in addition to that , note that @xmath58 , for each @xmath59 , so the set @xmath60 covers @xmath61 , and @xmath62 covers @xmath63 .",
    "hence , the snake becomes the attractor of the system @xmath47 . for completeness ,",
    "let us show that @xmath64 is a weak contraction .",
    "now , let @xmath70 and @xmath71 be any two fixed but arbitrarily chosen distinct points from @xmath28 . recall that our goal here is to prove that @xmath72 to deal with",
    ", we will distinguish the two following cases : * case 1 .",
    "* @xmath73 or @xmath74 . without loss of generality ,",
    "let us suppose @xmath74 .",
    "then @xmath75 and by ( [ obserwacja1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath76 . * case 2 . * @xmath77 and @xmath78 , for some integers",
    "we may assume that @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , @xmath81 . from the cosine formula",
    ", we have that @xmath82 as well as @xmath83 thus , the difference between the squares of those distances satisfies the next expresion : @xmath84 since @xmath85 .",
    "further ,    a.   if @xmath86 , then @xmath87 , so @xmath88 . consequently , the inequality ( [ diament ] ) becomes strict , which implies that @xmath89 .",
    "this gives ( [ eqexpectedresult ] ) .",
    "b.   if @xmath90 and @xmath91 , then @xmath92 so from ( [ diament ] ) , we again get ( [ eqexpectedresult ] ) .",
    "c.   finally , if @xmath90 and @xmath93 , then we get @xmath94 from ( [ obserwacja2 ] ) , both sides of this inequality become positive , so @xmath95 and from ( [ diament ] ) , we get ( [ eqexpectedresult ] ) .",
    "let us consider the following piecewise linear periodic function : @xmath96 \\text { for some } n\\in{\\mathbb{z } } ;   \\\\ n - t & \\text{if } t\\in[n-\\frac{1}{2},n ] \\text { for some } n\\in{\\mathbb{z } } , \\end{cases}\\ ] ] whose graph looks like as follows :        on the other hand , _ shark teeth _",
    "type spaces were constructed in @xcite .",
    "they are parametrized through an infinite non - decreasing sequence @xmath100 .",
    "thus , let @xmath101\\times\\{0\\}$ ] be the _",
    "bone _ of the shark teeth , and for every @xmath102 , let @xmath103\\big\\}$ ] be the @xmath104 _ row _ of the teeth .",
    "the space called shark teeth is given by @xmath105        in @xcite , it was proved that the shark teeth constructed in the plane @xmath21 through the non - decreasing sequence @xmath106 where @xmath107 denotes the integer part , is not homeomorphic to any ifs - attractor . in other words , this is not a banach fractal .",
    "however , it can be still shown that this is a topological fractal , which was proved in @xcite , though we contribute a shorter proof next .",
    "recall that a peano continuum @xmath108 is a continuous image of the unit interval . for the free arc @xmath109",
    ", there exists a continuous injective map @xmath111{\\longrightarrow}l$ ] , which divides @xmath108 into three pieces : @xmath112 , where @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and there also exist continuous functions @xmath115{\\longrightarrow}p_i$ ] , for @xmath116 .",
    "we may assume that @xmath117 , for @xmath118 , where @xmath119 .",
    "further , let us consider the tent map : @xmath120 ;   \\\\ 1-x & \\text{if } x\\in[\\frac{1}{2},1 ] , \\end{cases}\\ ] ] as well as three contractions acting on @xmath27 $ ] , given as follows . for all @xmath121 , let us define @xmath122 . note that @xmath123 , and @xmath124)=\\bigcup_{i\\in j}[\\frac{i}3,\\frac{i+1}3]=[0,1]$ ] .",
    "next , we explain how to construct a finite family @xmath125 , which consists of continuous functions for which @xmath108 is a topological fractal .",
    "in fact , for all @xmath121 , let @xmath126 and for @xmath118 , let us consider @xmath127 hence , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 , for @xmath118 . moreover , @xmath130 for all @xmath121 , and it is also satisfied that both @xmath131 and @xmath132 are uniformly continuous ( as a continuous function on a compact space ) . they allow to affirm that , for an arbitrary open cover @xmath13 of peano continuum @xmath108 , and for its lebesgue number @xmath133 , there exists @xmath134 such that for every @xmath135 , the condition @xmath136 implies that @xmath137 , where @xmath44 is a metric on @xmath108 .",
    "let us fix a natural number @xmath138 such that @xmath139 . then for every @xmath140",
    ", the diameter of the set @xmath141 is less than @xmath133 .",
    "indeed , for every @xmath121 , and @xmath142 , the image sets @xmath143 and @xmath144 are singletons .",
    "thus , if @xmath145 , then the set @xmath141 has diameter equal to @xmath146 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath147 , so @xmath148 .",
    "this implies that the diameter of the set @xmath141 is less than @xmath133 , and accordingly , @xmath108 is a topological fractal .",
    "proposition [ prop:1 ] generalizes the result obtained independently by d. dumitru , who showed in @xcite that the union of a peano continuum and a segment , such that their intersection is a singleton , becomes a topological fractal .",
    "hence , the desired result yields as a consequence of former arguments :            to provide an appropriate definition for the space @xmath108 , once again let us switch into standard polar coordinates in @xmath21 . indeed , for @xmath59 ,",
    "let us define @xmath150 , as well as @xmath151 . for any @xmath59",
    ", choose a piecewise linear arc @xmath152 ( consisting of finitely many line segments ) without self - intersections , which starts at @xmath153 , ends at @xmath154 , has a total length equal to @xmath155 , and is contained in the set @xmath156\\cup\\{\\rho_n\\}$ ] .",
    "thus , let us define @xmath157 .        in @xcite",
    ", it was proved that such space can not be a weak ifs - attractor , though it is easy to show that it is a banach fractal .",
    "in fact , we can topologically transform the space @xmath108 in a way such that every arc @xmath152 is a straight line segment whose length is equal to @xmath158 .",
    "let us recall some basic notions related to scattered spaces .",
    "a topological space @xmath6 is said to be _ scattered _ if every non - empty subspace @xmath159 has an isolated point which lies in @xmath159 .",
    "it is well known the fact that any compact metric space is scattered if and only if it is countable . moreover ,",
    "every compact scattered space is zero - dimensional , namely , it has a base consisting of clopen sets .",
    "further , for a scattered space @xmath6 let @xmath160 be the cantor - bendixson derivative of @xmath6 .",
    "inductively we could define          in @xcite , it was proved that every compact scattered metric space with the limit height is not a topological ifs - attractor .",
    "due to that fact , it is enough to construct a space with the limit height , which becomes a standard construction .",
    "in fact , let us consider a convergent sequence in the real line , whose height is equal to @xmath165 .",
    "thus , we can equate it with the space @xmath166 , with the order topology .",
    "if for each point in this space we take a sequence which converges to such a point , then we obtain a space @xmath167 .",
    "if we do the same on that space , then @xmath168 holds .",
    "we will follow that construction , so we can get any space @xmath169 , for every @xmath170 .",
    "the height of such spaces is @xmath171 ( a successor ordinal ) .",
    "let us construct a space @xmath172 $ ] , which becomes equivalent to @xmath173 for a limit height .",
    "it consists of countable many disjoint blocks which converge to @xmath146 .",
    "their heights are @xmath174 as @xmath175 , so the whole space has a limit height equal to @xmath176 .",
    "it turns out that countable compact spaces with the limit height are the only non - topological fractals among zero - dimensional spaces .",
    "moreover , in zero - dimensional sets both notions of banach and topological fractals are equivalent .",
