    "motivated by string inspired theories @xcite , a great deal of effort has , over the recent years , gone into the study of higher dimensional general relativity ( gr ) theories .",
    "examples of such theories include noncompactified @xmath1-dimensional gr @xcite ( where the observable universe is assumed to lie on an embedded @xmath2 ( 4d ) hypersurface ) , kaluza ",
    "klein theory @xcite ( where the extra dimensions are compactified ) and the braneworld models inspired by string / m - theory randall , sms , maartensrev .",
    "a central issue in such theories has been how to explain the fact that the observable universe is ( very nearly ) confined to a particular hypersurface . in most braneworld models ,",
    "stringy effects are invoked to argue that in low energy regimes particles are restricted to a special @xmath2 _ brane _ hypersurface , which is embedded in a higher ( usually five)-dimensional _ bulk _ , while the gravitational field is free to propagate in the bulk @xcite .    in the case of other higher - dimensional gr theories , however , such confinement needs to be explained .",
    "this has provided strong motivation for the consideration of the so - called warped product spaces @xcite and the investigation of their geometrical properties .",
    "we recall that the geometrical considerations of warped product spacetimes predate their applications in these higher - dimensional contexts and were first considered by bishop and o neill @xcite in the context of @xmath2 general relativity .",
    "geodesic motion in connection with higher - dimensional theories has been considered by a number of authors in recent years @xcite .",
    "our interest in studying such motions specifically in the context of warped product spaces arises from the realization of the fact that there is a strong connection between the 5d geodesics and the analytical form of the warping function . indeed , as we shall see in this paper",
    ", it is possible to make a general qualitative analysis of the behaviour of massive particles and photons in the fifth dimension from the knowledge of the warping function .",
    "this can in turn allow questions concerning the possibility of hypersurface confinement as well as the stability of the confined motions with respect to small perturbations to be treated with great generality .",
    "an assumption usually made in the braneworld scenarios is that the branes possess an infinitesimal thickness . in this sense",
    "one may talk about _",
    "@xmath3-confinement _ of massive particles and light rays .",
    "there are also smooth versions of this scenario which consider the possibility that branes may have a finite thickness @xcite . in that case",
    "one may talk about _ quasi - confinement_.    here we shall demonstrate a novel example of the latter in the context of @xmath4-dimensional warped product spaces which we shall refer to as _ oscillatory confinement _",
    ", whereby the particles in the four - dimensional hypersurface can oscillate about the hypersurface while remaining close to it . as we shall show below such behaviour",
    "can indeed occur for large classes of bulks which possess warped product geometries .",
    "our analysis is fairly general and the results may be applied to different examples of warped product spacetimes considered in the literature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we write the geodesic equations for warped product spaces and consider the parts due to 4d and the fifth dimension separately .",
    "we then show that the equation that describes the motion in 5d decouples from the rest .",
    "we proceed in section 3 to rewrite the geodesic equation in the fifth dimension as an autonomous planar dynamical system .",
    "we then employ phase plane analysis to study the motion of particles with nonzero rest mass ( timelike geodesics ) and photons ( null geodesics ) respectively .",
    "such qualitative analysis allows very general conclusions to be drawn about the possible existence of confined motions and their stability in the neighbourhood of hypersurfaces .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of further applications in section 4 .    throughout latin indices take values in the range ( 0,1, ... ,4 ) while greek indices run over ( 0,1,2,3 ) .",
    "warped geometries are at the core of the randall - sundrum models .",
    "technically we can define a warped product space in the following way .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be two  riemannian ( or pseudo - riemannian ) manifolds of dimension @xmath7 and @xmath8 , with metrics @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "suppose we are given a smooth function @xmath11 ( which is referred to as the _ warping function _ ) .",
    "then we can construct a new riemannian ( pseudo - riemannian ) manifold by setting @xmath12 and defining a metric @xmath13 . in this paper",
    "we shall take @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a four - dimensional lorentzian manifold with signature @xmath16 ( referred to as the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional _ spacetime _ ) . in local",
    "coordinates @xmath17 the line element corresponding to this metric will be denoted by @xmath18    let us now consider the equations of geodesics in the five - dimensional space @xmath19where @xmath20 is an affine parameter and @xmath21 are the 5d christoffel symbols of the second kind defined by @xmath22 . denoting the fifth coordinate @xmath23 by @xmath24 and the remaining coordinates @xmath25(the `` spacetime '' _ _  _ _ coordinates ) by @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath27 , it is not difficult to show that the `` 4d part '' of the geodesic equations ( [ geodesics5d ] ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath28where @xmath29and @xmath30 .",
    "we shall assume that the five - dimensional manifold @xmath31 can be foliated by a family of hypersurfaces @xmath32 defined by the equation @xmath33 constant .",
    "then the geometry of each hypersurface , say  @xmath34 will be determined by the induced metric @xmath35therefore the quantities @xmath36 which appear on the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 4dpart ] ) may be identified with the christoffel symbols associated with the induced metric in the leaves of the foliation defined above .",
    "we shall consider the class of warped geometries given by the following line element @xmath37where @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xmath40 .",
    "for this metric it is easy to see has an inverse @xmath41 , that is , @xmath42 .",
    "this may be easily seen since , by definition , @xmath43 . ]",
    "that @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath24 .",
    "thus in the case of the warped product space ( warped ) the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 4dpart ] ) reduces to @xmath46 and the 4d part of the geodesic equations becomes @xmath47likewise the geodesic equation for the fifth coordinate @xmath24 in the warped product space becomes    @xmath48    by restricting ourselves to 5d timelike geodesics @xmath49 we can readily decouple the above equation from the 4d spacetime coordinates to obtain @xmath50similarly , to study the motion of photons in 5d , we must consider the null geodesics @xmath51 , in which case eq .",
    "( [ lwarped ] ) becomes @xmath52    equations ( [ 5dmotion ] ) and ( [ 5dphoton ] ) are ordinary differential equations of second - order which , in principle , can be solved if the function @xmath53 is given .",
    "conversely , if @xmath54 is known then @xmath38 can be determined ( up to a constant of integration ) provided that we can write @xmath55 .",
    "we recall that the hypersurface sets the boundary conditions for the warping function .",
    "if the warping function @xmath38 is given a priori , then we can obtain a great deal of information about the motion in the fifth dimension by performing a qualitative analysis of eqs .",
    "( [ 5dmotion ] )  and ( 5dphoton ) , without the need to solve these equations analytically . to do this we define the variable @xmath56 and consider instead of ( [ 5dmotion ] ) or ( [ 5dphoton ] )  the autonomous dynamical system andronov @xmath57 with @xmath58 , where@xmath59 in the case of ( [ 5dmotion ] ) ( corresponding to the motion of particles with nonzero rest mass ) and @xmath60 in the case of ( [ 5dphoton ] ) ( corresponding to the motion of photons ) . in the investigation of dynamical systems a crucial role",
    "is played by their _ equilibrium points _ , which in the case of system ( [ dynamical ] ) are given by @xmath61 .",
    "the knowledge of these points together with their stability properties allows a great deal of information to be gained regarding the types of behaviour allowed by the system .",
    "thus if for a particular geodesic we know @xmath62 as a function of the parameter @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath63 , then since @xmath64 , knowing the behaviour of @xmath54 from qualitative analysis will enable us to deduce the time evolution of the motion of a particle ( or light ray ) in the fifth dimension .",
    "we begin by considering the case of nonzero rest mass particles , whose motion in the fifth dimension is governed by the dynamical system @xmath65 the equilibrium points of ( [ dynamical1 ] ) are given by @xmath66 and the zeros of the function @xmath67 ( if they exist ) which we generically denote by @xmath68 .",
    "these solutions , pictured as fixed points in the phase plane , correspond to curves which lie entirely in a hypersurface @xmath32 of our foliation ( since they have @xmath33 constant ) .",
    "it turns out that these curves are timelike geodesics with respect to the hypersurface induced geometry .",
    "indeed , the existence of equilibrium points of the dynamical system ( [ dynamical ] ) has the important consequence that the geodesics of the bulk and that of the hypersurface ( @xmath69 constant ) coincide .",
    "this can be seen directly from the equations ( [ 4dpart ] ) and ( [ lwarped ] ) , and is perfectly consistent with a well - known theorem of differential geometry according to which the geodesics of a riemannian space and that of a particular hypersurface coincide ( i.e. confinement occurs ) if and only if the extrinsic curvature of that hypersurface vanishes ( see e.g. eisenhart where such hypersurfaces are referred to as _ totally geodesic _ ) .",
    "note that for the metric ( [ warped ] ) the extrinsic curvature of the hypersurfaces @xmath32 is given by @xmath70 , which is clearly zero at the equilibrium points , where @xmath71 .",
    "thus in the absence of equilibrium points ( i.e. @xmath72 ) the extrinsic curvature does not vanish and according to the above theorem the bulk and hypersurface geodesics can not be identical .    to obtain information about the possible modes of behaviour of particles and light rays in such hypersurfaces , it is important to study the nature and stability of the corresponding equilibrium points",
    ". this can be done by linearising equations ( [ dynamical1 ] ) and studying the eigenvalues of the corresponding jacobian matrix about the equilibrium points .",
    "assuming that the function @xmath67 vanishes , at least at one point @xmath68 , it can readily be shown that the corresponding eigenvalues are determined by the sign of the second derivative @xmath73 , at the equilibrium point , and the following possibilities can arise for the equilibrium points of the dynamical system ( [ dynamical1 ] ) :    case i. if @xmath74 , then the equilibrium point @xmath75 is a _",
    "center_. this represents a case in which the solutions near the equilibrium point have the topology of a circle . in that case",
    "the phase portrait consists of closed curves describing the motions of particles oscillating about the hypersurface @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) indefinitely ( see the top panel in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the amplitudes of the oscillations will depend on initial conditions .",
    "we note that the existence of such cyclic motions is independent of the ordinary 4d spacetime dimensions , and , except for the conditions @xmath78 and  @xmath74 , the warping function @xmath79 remains completely arbitrary .",
    "the presence of such center equilibrium points with the consequent quasi - confinement of particles can be viewed as providing examples of _ almost totally geodesic hypersurfaces _ ( see the lower panel in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    .",
    "in this case the particles oscillate about the hypersurface @xmath77 .",
    "this provides a quasi - confinement mechanism whereby massive particles enter and leave the hypersurface @xmath32 indefinitely ( lower panel).,title=\"fig:\",width=288,height=288 ] . in this case",
    "the particles oscillate about the hypersurface @xmath77 .",
    "this provides a quasi - confinement mechanism whereby massive particles enter and leave the hypersurface @xmath32 indefinitely ( lower panel).,title=\"fig:\",width=288,height=288 ]    case ii .",
    "if @xmath80 , then the point @xmath75 is a _",
    "saddle point_. in this case the solution corresponding to the equilibrium point e is highly unstable and the smallest perturbations will lead to exponential divergence of the solutions and hence the particles - from the hypersurface ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the only ( measure zero ) exception is provided by the stable manifold of the point e , represented by the lines ae and be , along which particles are attracted towards the brane .",
    "an example of this highly unstable `` confinement '' is provided by the warping function gremm @xmath81where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are positive constants . here",
    "we have a unique equilibrium point at @xmath84 and it is easy to verify that @xmath85 in this case . in this connection we note that for large values of @xmath24 the warping function ( [ warpfunction ] ) approaches that of the randall - sundrum metric @xcite ) @xmath86where @xmath87 is a constant . in this case",
    "@xmath88 according to whether @xmath24 is positive or negative .",
    "hence for @xmath89 there exist no equilibrium points , and therefore no confinement of particles purely due to gravitational effects .",
    "however , in this thin wall limit if we take the extrinsic curvature of the brane @xmath84 as being zero , then ( [ dynamical1 ] ) implies confinement . nevertheless , as was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite this is a highly unstable confinement in the sense that any small transversal perturbations in the motion of massive particles along the brane will cause them to be expelled into the extra dimension .",
    "however , this case lies somewhat outside the scope of the metrics that we are considering here as in this case the warping function is not smooth ( the first derivative of @xmath79  with respect to the extra coordinate is not continuous at @xmath84 ) . in the braneworld scenario , as is well known , stable confinement of matter fields is possible at the quantum level if we take into account interaction with a scalar field @xcite . in a purely classical picture , however , one would require mechanisms other than geodesic confinement in order to constrain massive particles to move on hypersurfaces in a stable way .",
    "the equilibrium point e is a saddle . in this case confinement",
    "is highly unstable .",
    ", width=288,height=288 ]    case iii .",
    "if @xmath90 , then both eigenvalues are zero , which corresponds to a degenerate case . to carry out a qualitative analysis of the solutions near the equilibrium point , in this case",
    ", would require the knowledge of the third ( or higher ) derivative of the function @xmath79 .",
    "we shall not consider this case in its generality .",
    "however , if @xmath79 is constant ( case iv ) , then we can easily draw a global phase portrait of the system .",
    "_  _    case iv .",
    "if @xmath79= constant , then @xmath67 vanishes for all values of @xmath24 , which implies there is an infinite number of non - isolated equilibrium points , that is , we have a line of equilibrium points ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "perturbations along this line are neutrally stable , which implies that particles placed on any of the hypersurfaces of the foliation @xmath33 constant , will remain there so long as they do not receive a transversal velocity to the hypersurface .",
    "case v. if there are no equilibrium points , that is , the warping function @xmath79 does not have any turning points for any value of @xmath24 , then we can not have confinement of classical particles to hypersurfaces solely due to gravitational effects .",
    "an example of this situation is illustrated by the warping function @xmath91considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we note that even when there are no equilibrium points , the picture of dynamics can still be obtained if @xmath79 is known , by obtaining a first integral of the system ( [ dynamical ] ) .",
    "this can easily be done by writing this system as the first - order differential equation@xmath92which can be readily integrated to yield@xmath93where @xmath94 is a constant of integration .",
    "finally we examine the motion of photons ( null geodesics ) and ask whether they can be confined to or a neighbourhood of a hypersurface . in this case the dynamical system ( [ dynamical ] ) becomes @xmath95the equilibrium points now are given by @xmath66 , which consists of a line of equilibrium points along the @xmath24-axis , with eigenvalues both equal to zero . as a result there exist 5d null geodesics in any hypersurface @xmath33 constant .",
    "this demonstrates that confinement of photons to hypersurfaces does not depend upon the warping factor .",
    "there are also regions of stability and instability with respect to small perturbations along the @xmath24-axis .",
    "as was pointed out in the previous section we can easily obtain a first integral of the system ( dynamical2 )  which is given by ( [ first - integral ] ) . in the case of the motion of photons ( @xmath60 )",
    "this gives @xmath96where @xmath97 is a constant of integration .",
    "therefore we can obtain a global picture of the solutions ( [ dynamical2 ] )  provided that we have some qualitative knowledge of the function @xmath79 .",
    "many different cases can arise , depending upon the nature of @xmath79 . here for definiteness and simplicity we impose @xmath0 symmetry on the geometry of the bulk .",
    "the following are some possible examples :    * @xmath79 is an increasing monotonic function for @xmath98 which approaches the limit @xmath99 as @xmath100 ( see the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this includes the case of the warping function considered in ( @xcite ) .",
    "* @xmath79 is a decreasing monotonic function for @xmath98 that approaches the limit @xmath101 as @xmath100 , which is the case of the warping function given by ( [ warpfunction ] ) ( see the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "note the interesting behaviour of photons that are not confined : if we set them in motion towards the hypersurface @xmath102 then after reaching a minimal distance from @xmath32 they bounce back to infinity , showing clearly that they are repelled by @xmath32 ; * @xmath79 is constant , in which case we have the same phase diagram as in the case of massive particles .",
    "finally it is worth noting that in the case of null geodesics , the equilibrium points of the eqs .",
    "( [ dynamical2 ] ) do not require @xmath103 , which is a consequence of the fact that the above mentioned theorem @xcite does not apply to null geodesics .     symmetry with an increasing monotonic function @xmath79 for @xmath98 and @xmath99 as @xmath24 @xmath104 .",
    "there is confinement of photons at any hypersurface @xmath32 of the bulk foliation @xmath33 constant .",
    "the bottom panel shows the corresponding phase portrait for the cases where @xmath79 is a decreasing monotonic function for @xmath98 that approaches the limit @xmath105 as @xmath100 .",

    "we have studied some aspects of the motion of massive particles and photons in five - dimensional warped product spaces .",
    "spaces of this type have received a great deal of attention over the recent years mainly in connection with the braneworld scenarios .",
    "our treatment has been geometrical and classical in nature and we have considered confinement to hypersurfaces purely due to classical gravitational effects .    employing the splitting that naturally occurs in such spaces between the motion in the fifth dimension and the remaining dimensions , we have found , using phase plane analysis , a novel form of _ quasi - confinement _ which is neutrally stable . in a sense",
    "this amounts to a generalisation of the @xmath3 -confinement of particles in thin branes .",
    "an important reason to consider models outside the framework of thin branes is that there is a characteristic minimum length given by the string scale seahra , csaki , gremm , wolfe .",
    "the importance of the type of confinement discussed here is that it is due purely to the classical gravitational effects , without requiring the presence of brane type confinement mechanisms .    as an example",
    ", we have found that in the case of the randall - sundrum metric gravity alone is not capable of confining massive particles , although photons may be confined .",
    "as is well known , the particle confinement in this scenario is achieved by means of a scalar field @xcite .",
    "an assumption usually made in braneworld scenarios , which plays an important role in connection with confinement in these models , is that of @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "it is therefore important to take a closer look at the models we have found , which are capable of providing successful confinement , from this perspective .    recalling that @xmath0 symmetry implies @xmath107it is easy to check that this condition is satisfied in cases where the hypersurfaces are located at the turning points @xmath77 of the functions @xmath108 .",
    "this follows from the fact that in such cases @xmath109 , and hence @xmath110 , have different signs on either sides of the hypersurface and thus @xmath0 symmetry is satisfied by default .",
    "importantly this includes all the equilibrium points we have found in the massive particle case .",
    "finally it is interesting to compare our results with the classical theorem , according to which the geodesics of a riemannian space coincide with the geodesics of an embedded ( totally geodesic ) hypersurface if and only if the extrinsic curvature of that hypersurface vanishes .",
    "the analysis involved in proving this theorem @xcite , though general , does not address the case of null geodesics , as it confines itself to positive definite metrics . nor does it provide any information regarding the stability of the this coincidence .",
    "our analysis on the other hand , although restricted to the case of warped product spaces , provides information regarding the stability of confinement to totally geodesic hypersurfaces , through the use of dynamical system analysis .",
