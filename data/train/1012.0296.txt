    "we show in sec .",
    "[ sec - clockwise - exchange ] that the phase acquired by the majorana fermions when they are exchanged through a junction is determined by a local characteristic of the junction ( the junction chirality ) that is independent of the exact path taken by the majoranas , as well as the locations of the ts and nts regions .",

    "there we see that in addition to the chirality of junctions there is another representation - invariant quantity relevant to the braiding of majoranas , i.e. the phase acquired when a majorana is transported around a loop in the network .",
    "this ` loop factor ' completes the description of the transformations produced by majorana motion in wire networks .",
    "our analysis appeals only to the general necessity for consistency in the effects of majorana motion , as well as a few simple assumptions about the network set forth in sec .",

    "the topologically degenerate subspace of states of a system of topological nanowire segments proximity - coupled to a superconductor may be manipulated via an adiabatically time - varying hamiltonian .",
    "such operations result in changes of expectation values of the various observables composed of products of majorana fermion operators .",
    "these expectation values can be computed equivalently in both the schrodinger and the heisenberg representations .",
    "therefore the non - abelian statistics generated by braiding operations can be studied by analyzing the time - dependent majorana operator @xmath19 in the heisenberg representation .",

    "we will show that in a general superconducting system an exchange of one pair of majorana fermions @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the heisenberg representation is described by a non - abelian braid matrix @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a time after the exchange is complete .",

    "we start by describing the process of exchanging a pair of majorana fermions in terms of the underlying bcs hamiltonian in the heisenberg representation .",
    "consider first a hamiltonian @xmath29 which has a pair of majorana solutions @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",

    "it is necessary to vary @xmath33 adiabatically in time in a certain time interval @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "the hamiltonian is taken to be static before and after this interval .",
    "thus , one can describe the states before @xmath35 and after @xmath36 by eigenstates of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "moreover for exchange operations , we will require that the hamiltonian at the end of the operation @xmath38 be the same as that at the beginning @xmath39 .",
    "since the evolution was adiabatic , zero energy majorana operators at times @xmath35 evolve into zero energy operators at time @xmath36 such that @xmath40=[\\gamma_j(\\tau),h_{bcs}(0)]=0 $ ] for @xmath36 .",

    "the solution to this equation can be written formally in terms of a unitary operator @xmath20 as @xmath45 where @xmath20 is the time - ordered exponential @xmath46 . from eq .",
    "[ eq : maj ] , it is clear that @xmath30 remains majorana for the entirety of the time evolution ( i.e. @xmath47 ) .",

    "it follows from eq .",
    "[ eq : maj ] that @xmath52 , and therefore @xmath42 , can be uniquely determined from the relevant bcs hamiltonian .",
    "using arguments analogous to the ones used above , one can show that if the trajectories are reversed i.e. by replacing @xmath33 by @xmath53 the values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 are interchanged .",
    "thus the exchange operation can be described in terms of a unique unitary operator @xmath56 which we will refer to as the braid matrix such that @xmath57 with the time - reversed braid matrix being described by @xmath58 .",
    "the above argument only shows that @xmath51 .",
    "however as discussed above , non - abelian statistics implies a relative @xmath24 sign between the final majorana fermions such that @xmath59 . in this paragraph",
    ", we show by contradiction that this follows from the conservation of the fermion parity symmetry obeyed by the bcs hamiltonian .",
    "suppose @xmath60 is the unitary operator that exchanges a pair of majorana fermions @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "suppose , for the sake of argument , that @xmath61 do not pick up a ( relative ) @xmath24 sign under @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath17 then transforms the neutral fermion operator @xmath62 into @xmath63 .",
    "consider now the action of @xmath17 on the ground state of @xmath64 .",
    "since @xmath30 commute with the hamiltonian @xmath29 , so do @xmath65,@xmath66 and the number operator @xmath67 .",

    "furthermore if @xmath68 is a ground state so are @xmath69 and @xmath70 . from here",
    "it is straightforward to see that the ground state has a 2-fold degeneracy : namely the empty state @xmath71 and @xmath72 . applying @xmath65 to @xmath73 , where @xmath71 is the empty state",
    ", we see that @xmath74 , so @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a proportionality constant .",
    "the time - dependent bcs hamiltonian @xmath33 is symmetric under the unitary fermion parity operator @xmath77 which transforms fermions @xmath78 as @xmath79 .",

    "thus there are 2 possibilities for the result of an adiabatic exchange @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "this operation can be compactly represented in the majorana space as @xmath85 as claimed . here",
    "the sign in the exponent is determined by the path of the adiabatic exchange .",
    "the abelian phase @xmath86 can not be determined by considering only the operator dynamics and requires consideration of the ground state wave - function . as discussed in the previous subsection ,",

    "as noted above ( eq .  [ eq : map ] ) , the resulting transformation must have the form @xmath93 , where @xmath84 .",
    "we shall demonstrate this fact for the most general form of the junction , and show that the effect of an exchange through the junction is the same for majoranas with the topological and with the non - topological phase in the region between them . in the process , we shall also show that the unitary transformation enacted by an exchange through the junction is independent of the overall sign chosen in the definition of any majorana state .    in order to determine @xmath18",
    ", we will examine more closely the steps taken in a clockwise exchange .",
    "we base this analysis on the following three assumptions about the motion of majoranas in the wire network :     + 1 .",
    "ll regions of the wire beside the majoranas have unique + ground states for both the topological and non - topological + phase .",
    "that is , aside from the majoranas at the phase + boundaries , there are no zero modes in the system .",
    "the process of altering the phase boundaries is carried out + adiabatically , so that when a topological region is extended + or contracted from location @xmath94 to location @xmath95 , the majorana + zero mode operator at its end is transported according to +   + @xmath96 for extension +   + and +   + @xmath97 for contraction .",
    "the process is reversible , implying that @xmath98 .",
    "+   +    without these assumptions , it is impossible to consistently perform braiding operations through the junction . for consistency in expanding within the same segment , we require that @xmath99 so long as either points @xmath94 and @xmath95 , or points @xmath95 and @xmath100 are in the same segment .",
    "likewise , the requirement that majorana fermions remain properly normalized leads to @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "note that assumption 1 does not preclude the possibility of localized fermion bound states , but requires that such states are affected deterministically by the passage of a majorana .",
    "what is more , it requires that the effect of passing a majorana over such localized states is the same independent of whether a topological region is being contracted or expanded . with assumption 2 , this is equivalent to the condition that two majoranas brought together by the contraction of a single topological ( or non - topological ) region will be the either in the ground state or the excited state independent of the location at which they are brought together .    if the parity of a short topological region at @xmath94 , as determined by the fusion channel @xmath103 of the two majoranas at its end points , does not match the parity of the ground state when that region is eliminated , a quasiparticle will be left behind by the elimination of the topological region .",
    "this allows us to define the local vacuum channel @xmath104 for two majoranas by the form of the hamiltonian @xmath105 when they are brought very close together , where @xmath106 is the coupling constant for two majoranas with a topological ( t ) or non - topological ( n ) region between them .",
    "we set @xmath107 where @xmath108 is always further from the junction than @xmath94 .",

    "assumptions 1 and 3 together imply that if the system started in a state such that elimination of the topological region would leave the system in an excited state when the elimination happens at @xmath94 , the same must be true if the region is eliminated at @xmath95 .",

    "@xmath157 is the vacuum channel as determined by the local hamiltonian of the form ( [ ham ] ) .",

    "for example , in redefining @xmath165 , one must also change @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 in order to maintain consistency with the definition of other majorana operators . because the definition of @xmath145 ( or @xmath128 ) contains factors involving each majorana operator twice , @xmath148 is invariant under this transformation . likewise , if one changed @xmath169 , @xmath170 as defined above remains invariant because @xmath171 would also change sign .",

    "each majorana would therefore acquire an additional minus sign during the exchange , changing the effective chirality of the junction .    in any case",
    ", different junctions within a wire network do not necessarily have the same chirality . to understand the effect that this might have on a computational algorithm ,",
    "consider the situation in which a pair of majorana fermions @xmath12 and @xmath172 are exchanged clockwise via first one junction with @xmath173 then through a second junction with @xmath174 .",

    ", the net effect is no braid at all , rather than a double braid .",
    "more explicitly , we shall examine the effect of this manipulation when @xmath12 forms a qubit with @xmath11 , and @xmath172 forms a qubit with @xmath176 .",
    "then the fusion channel of @xmath11 and @xmath12 evolves as @xmath177 that is , the @xmath11 , @xmath12 qubit flips do to this double exchange only if the chiralities of the two junctions being used are the same .",

    "it is worth noting that while the result of a braiding of two majoranas is uniquely determined by the properties of the underlying wire network , the braid result may be dependent on the path taken through the wire system .",
