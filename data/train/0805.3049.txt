    "tunneling is an inherent phenomenon in highly anisotropic cuprate superconductors.@xcite due to their layered structure of conducting sheets intercalated by insulating blocks , superconductivity in these compounds is often described in terms of thin superconducting layers coupled via josephson tunneling .",
    "similarly , tunneling between the layers is expected to affect the transverse ( @xmath2-axis ) conductivity in the normal state , in competition with thermally activated interlayer hopping .",
    "if the interlayer barriers are not dramatically high , the latter process is a natural consequence at sufficiently high temperatures .",
    "+ in this sense , measurements of the @xmath2-axis conductivity add to the various other probes of the transverse quasiparticle transport : intrinsic tunneling spectroscopy , scanning tunneling spectroscopy , angle - resolved photo emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) .",
    "in particular , when an intrinsic tunnel junction exists , @xmath9 is a good measure of the density of states ( dos ) around the fermi level ( low energy , in the spectroscopic language ) .",
    "+ experimental investigations of the transverse properties , such as the differential conductivity @xmath3 and arpes ( which probes the @xmath2-axis properties at selected momentum ) , reveal the existence of different energy scales and their evolution with doping and temperature .",
    "the most evident finding is the appearance of sharp features at the superconducting transition (  peaks \" ) at typical energies @xmath10 .",
    "the temperature evolution of @xmath10 which , starting from zero , increases upon decreasing @xmath5 from @xmath11 , ensures the identification with the superconducting gap . + much less obvious is the appearance of weaker features (  humps \" ) at larger energies @xmath12 , which is often identified with the pseudogap . in this case",
    "the temperature dependence is much less pronounced .",
    "sometimes a constant @xmath13 is observed decreasing @xmath5 , while only the number of carriers is seen to decrease .",
    "the interpretation of the connection between @xmath14 and @xmath13 is still a very debated subject@xcite and a crucial issue for the understanding of high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "+ measurements of the differential conductivity @xmath3 gave a substantial contribution in bringing the mentioned features into a clearer light , at least on experimental grounds .",
    "the superconducting gap has been identified with the voltage @xmath15 where the peaks in @xmath3 appear.@xcite a very weak temperature dependence of the bias voltage where the humps appeared , @xmath16 , has been consistently reported in several papers.@xcite in addition , it was shown that @xmath16 was insensitive to a magnetic field , while @xmath15 was reduced to zero by large magnetic fields,@xcite suggesting a different nature of the phenomena involved .",
    "+ for what concerns the description of the data , the usual procedure has been to include some specific shape of the dos in the model to fit the shape of the @xmath3 curves . in particular , below @xmath11 it is now customary to use some bcs - like expression of the superconducting gap to obtain estimates of the maximum gap and of the scattering rate from fitting of the @xmath3 curves.@xcite this approach has been extended to the fit of the humps . taking two different gaps",
    "the @xmath3 at 4 k were reproduced.@xcite a continuation of the fitting of the @xmath3 above @xmath11 with a nearly @xmath17independent gap has been also reported.@xcite the @xmath17independence of @xmath16 ( ref . ) and , consequently , of the pseudogap if one identifies the experimental feature with a gap in the dos , would imply that @xmath12 is an energy scale for a crossover instead that for a true transition .",
    "+ proceeding toward the normal state , we note that another interesting feature appears .",
    "the @xmath3 curves at high @xmath5 ( and sufficiently large doping ) present a very anomalous downward parabolic behavior,@xcite which has been treated up to now as an unspecified  background \" .",
    "+ in this paper we address the issue of the normal state of layered superconductors , focussing on bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 ( bscco ) , where most of the experiments have been performed .",
    "we build up a model for the @xmath2-axis @xmath3 based on the presence of two different energy barriers , where each one gives rise to tunnel and thermally activated currents.@xcite we show that this simple model , based solely on the existence of two energy barriers and without any particular features in the dos , can reproduce many aspects of the experimental @xmath3 . in particular , the parabolic behavior is reproduced quantitatively . the presence ( in overdoped bscco ) or absence ( in underdoped bscco ) of such high-@xmath5 parabolic @xmath3 finds an explanation in the simulations with the different balance between tunneling and thermal activation , depending on the height of the energy barriers .",
    "moreover , the balance between thermal and tunnel currents across the barriers gives rise to humps in the @xmath3 , suggesting that the humps arise from purely normal - state tunneling phenomena .",
    "the nearly constant position of the humps as a function of the temperature in experimental data , as well as the crossing of the @xmath3 at a characteristic voltage in underdoped samples , are reproduced by the simulations . finally , a simple rescaling of the voltage scale by a factor @xmath82 is sufficient to bring the simulations in accurate quantitative agreement with experimental data taken in bscco mesas .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we recall the two - barrier model for the @xmath2-axis conduction , focussing on the extension of the model to the description of nonlinear @xmath3 vs. @xmath4 curves .",
    "we find that several experimental features are recovered by the simple model . in section [ disc ]",
    "we discuss data taken in bscco mesas in terms of the two - barrier model .",
    "a short summary is presented in section [ conc ] .",
    "it is generally believed that the @xmath2-axis conduction in bscco is determined by the layered structure . in particular",
    ", tunneling certainly plays a major role . to address this issue we have introduced and developed @xcite a phenomenological model for the out - of - plane resistivity @xmath18 in layered superconductors . in particular ,",
    "we have proposed that the two - layer structure of bscco could give rise to two barriers for the @xmath2 axis conductivity .",
    "the overall conductivity would then be the composition of thermal and tunnel transport across each of the barriers .",
    "a sketch of the barriers considered is presented in figure [ fig_barriers ] .",
    "clearly , this model directly applies to the true normal state , i.e. the state where no other energy scales appear ( due to , e.g. , the opening of the pseudogap or of the superconducting gap@xcite ) .",
    "more specifically , no particular _ ad hoc _ shape of the density of states is considered . regarding the scattering process involved",
    ", we have considered that tunneling across the barriers could be reduced due to incoherent in - plane scattering , along the lines of ref .. this process reduces the average interlayer tunneling hopping rate , thus leading to an increased charge localization in the @xmath19 planes . in particular , in - plane inelastic phononic scattering given by the scattering time @xmath20 reduces the tunneling matrix element @xmath21 to @xmath22 . in the linear response ( vanishing voltage ) , the resistivity in the two - barrier model is then given by the simple expression:@xcite + @xmath23^{-1 } \\label{rholin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first and second term in square brackets represent tunnel and thermal activation over the @xmath24th barrier , respectively .",
    "thus , the model represents a series of two elements , each of them is a parallel of two channels .",
    "scattering processes enter through @xmath25 ( in - plane scattering ) and @xmath26 ( out - of - plane scattering ) , where @xmath27 is the @xmath19 plane resistivity in the normal state , @xmath28  3    and @xmath29  12    are the spacings between the cuo@xmath0 layers , and the height @xmath30 of the @xmath24-th barrier enters through @xmath31 $ ] ( with @xmath32 , ref . ) . for small applied voltages one can take a rectangular shape for the energy barriers without loss of generality , as depicted in figure [ fig_barriers ] , upper panel . with this simple model we were able to reproduce the doping dependence of @xmath33 in bscco quantitatively , and in particular the evolution from a nearly linear @xmath33 in overdoped samples to the  semiconducting \" behavior in underdoped samples .",
    "in particular , the model was able to reproduce the local minimum of @xmath33 which appears at optimal doping and slight underdoping.@xcite the details , including the crossover from thermal to tunnel transport by varying the temperature and the height of the barrier , have been worked out and discussed previously.@xcite in the following we focus on the extension of this model to nonlinear transport .",
    "+ the problem of nonlinear tunneling is a long standing issue in solid state physics,@xcite and it is still far from being fully solved.@xcite due to the extreme complexity of the problem , we use an approach as simple as possible to incorporate the effect of finite voltages into our model .",
    "in particular , we have to incorporate ( a ) the deformation of the energy barriers due to increasing voltage , ( b ) the existence of two barriers  in series \" , which implies nonequal , @xmath4-dependent voltage drops on each barrier , leaving unaffected ( c ) the role of the in - plane scattering , which is a physical foundation of the linear model employed up to now . + in a nonlinear problem , it is expected that the applied voltage affects the shape and height of the energy barrier.@xcite this effect can not be taken into account by rectangular barriers . among the many possible choices , we have found that parabolic shapes for the energy barriers led to an analytical , albeit complicated , expression for the tunneling current .",
    "we checked that the results did not change appreciably with other barrier shapes , such as trapezoidal or quartic or higher order polynomials .",
    "while the simulations were not very sensitive to the detailed shape of the barriers , two requirements emerged from extensive simulations : first , the barriers needed to vary their height with the applied electric field , that is rectangular barriers were found to be unsuitable for an even qualitative reproduction of the experiments .",
    "second , we found that the existence of two different barriers ensured a nearly quantitative reproduction of the experimental @xmath3 .",
    "thus , we chose the energy profile sketched in figure [ fig_barriers ] ( middle panel ) to represent the two - barrier nonlinear model , with : @xmath34 in the interval @xmath35 , and zero otherwise .",
    "with respect to the previously defined @xmath30 , one has @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
