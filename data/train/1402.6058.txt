    "the purpose of a visual system is to sample light in such a way as to provide an animal with actionable knowledge of its surroundings that will permit it to survive and reproduce @xcite . in most cases ,",
    "this goal is achieved most effectively by a highly regular two - dimensional ( 2d ) array of photoreceptors that evenly sample incoming light to produce an accurate representation of the visual scene .",
    "classical sampling theory @xcite as well as more recent studies @xcite have demonstrated that the optimal arrangement of a 2d array of detectors is a triangular lattice ( i.e. , a hexagonal array ) . indeed , modeling studies suggest that any deviation from a perfectly regular arrangement of photoreceptors will cause deterioration in the quality of the image produced by a retina @xcite . accordingly",
    ", many species have evolved an optimal sampling arrangement of their photoreceptors .",
    "for example , the insect compound eye consists of a perfect hexagonal array of photoreceptive ommatidia @xcite .",
    "in addition , many teleost fish @xcite and some reptiles @xcite possess nearly crystalline arrangements of photoreceptors . these and other examples attest that a perfect or nearly perfectly ordered arrangement of photoreceptors can be realized in a biological system .",
    "diurnal birds have one of the most sophisticated cone visual systems of any vertebrate , consisting of four types of single cone ( violet , blue , green and red ) which mediate color vision and double cones involved in luminance detection @xcite ; see fig .",
    "[ fig1_cone ] . despite the presence of numerous evolutionary specializations in the avian eye , the overall arrangement of bird cone photoreceptors",
    "is not perfectly ordered but rather is irregular @xcite .",
    "the five avian cone types exist as five independent , spatial patterns , all embedded within a single monolayered epithelium .",
    "the individual cone patterns in the bird s retina are arranged such that cones of one type almost never occur in the near vicinity of other cones of the same type @xcite . in this way",
    ", the bird achieves a much more uniform arrangement of each of the cone types than would exist in a random ( poisson ) pattern of points .",
    "+    given the utility of the perfect triangular - lattice arrangement of photoreceptors for vision @xcite , the presence of disorder in the spatial arrangement of avian cone patterns is puzzling .",
    "it is crucial to ascertain whether the apparent `` disordered '' photoreceptor arrangements correspond to a different optimal solution because of constraints , such as cell size polydispersity , that are not present in the aforementioned insect retinas . by analyzing the chicken cone photoreceptor system using a variety of sensitive microstructural descriptors that arise in statistical mechanics and particle - packing theory @xcite ,",
    "we show here that the avian system possesses a remarkable type of correlated disorder at large length scales known as hyperuniformity @xcite , which has heretofore not been observed in a living organism .",
    "moreover , in a departure from any known physical system , the patterns of both the total population and the individual cell types are simultaneously hyperuniform , which we term _ multi - hyperuniformity_. we subsequently determine effective interactions between the photoreceptors on multiple length scales that could possibly explain their unusual disordered hyperuniform state .",
    "specifically , we consider two types of interactions that have competing effects in determining the degree of order in the system . indeed , we show via computer simulations that the local - energy minimizing configurations of such a many - particle interacting system quantitatively capture , with high accuracy , the unique spatial characteristics , including multi - hyperuniformity .",
    "the fact that the aforementioned competing interactions lead to disordered hyperuniform systems suggests that the photoreceptor patterns may represent the most uniform sampling arrangement attainable in the avian system due to intrinsic packing constraints associated with the photoreceptor cells .",

    "before presenting our analysis of the avian photoreceptor system , we first briefly review the `` hyperuniformity '' concept and its quantification , which plays a central role in this paper . in addition",

    "specifically , an infinite point configuration in @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space is _ hyperuniform _ if @xmath14 which implies that the infinite - wavelength density fluctuations of the system ( when appropriately scaled ) vanish @xcite .    for computational purposes , the structure factor @xmath15 for a given finite point configuration can be obtained directly from the positions of the points @xmath16 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the total number points in the system ( under periodic boundary conditions ) and @xmath19 is the wave vector .",

    "we remark that the average number of points in an observation window is @xmath31 for any statistically homogeneous point configuration .",

    "the relation in then implies that hyperuniform point patterns do not possess infinite - wavelength density fluctuations ( when appropriately scaled ) and hence from ( [ numasymp ] ) the number variance scales as the surface area of the window for large @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath37 in the large-@xmath25 limit .",
    "this result is valid for all periodic point patterns ( including perfect crystals ) , quasicrystals , and disordered systems in which the pair correlation function @xmath6 decays to unity exponentially fast @xcite .",
    "the degree to which large - scale density fluctuations are suppressed enables one to rank order crystals , quasicrystals and special disordered systems @xcite .",
    "disordered hyperuniform structures can be regarded as new states of disordered matter in that they behave more like perfect crystals or quasicrystals in the manner in which they suppress density fluctuations on large length scales , and yet are also like liquids and glasses in that they are statistically isotropic structures with no bragg peaks .",
    "thus , hyperuniform disordered materials possess a `` hidden order '' that is not apparent on short length scales .    for disordered hyperuniform systems with a total correlation function @xmath38 that does not decay to zero exponentially fast , other dependencies of the number variance on @xmath25 may be observed .",
    "for example , it is known that if @xmath39 for @xmath40 or , equivalently , if the total correlation function @xmath41 for large @xmath9 , then @xmath42 .",
    "more generally , for any reciprocal power law , @xmath43 or , equivalently , @xmath44 one can observe a number of different kinds of dependencies of the asymptotic number variance @xmath45 on the window radius @xmath25 for @xmath46 @xcite : @xmath47 note that in all cases , the number variance of a hyperuniform point pattern grows more slowly than @xmath27 .",
    "the local bond - orientational - order metric @xmath48 is defined as @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 runs over all cells in the system , @xmath11 runs over all neighbors of cell @xmath50 , @xmath51 is the angle between some fixed reference axis in the system and the bond connecting the centers of cells @xmath50 and @xmath11 , and @xmath52 is the total number of such bonds in the system .",
    "this quantity indicates the degree of orientational order in the local arrangement of the immediate neighbors of a cell and it is maximized ( i.e. , @xmath53 ) for the perfect hexagonal arrangement .    to characterize translational order of a configuration , we use the following translation order metric @xmath54 introduced in ref . @xcite and further applied in ref .",

    "the chicken retina contains five different cone cell types of different sizes : violet , blue , green , red and double .",

    "the spatial coordinates of each cell can be determined by the presence of a colored oil droplet in the cell s inner segment ( fig .",
    "[ fig1_cone ] ) .",
    "since the oil droplets used to identify the locations of individual photoreceptors are not always in exactly the same plane @xcite , pairs of real photoreceptors sometimes appear to be closer to one another than they are in actuality and in the simulations .",
    "in addition , the original slightly curved retina epithelium was flattened for imaging purposes @xcite .",
    "these effects introduce small errors in the intercell small - distance behavior but do not affect the overall statistics , especially on large length scales .",

    "the success of the simulations strongly suggests that the disordered hyperuniform photoreceptor patterns indeed arise from the competition between cell packing constraints and the tendency to maximize the degree of regularity for efficient light sampling , suggesting that the individual photoreceptor types are as uniform as they can be , given the packing constraints within the photoreceptor epithelium .",
    "by analyzing the chicken cone photoreceptor patterns using a variety of sensitive microstructural descriptors arising in statistical mechanics and particle - packing theory , we found that these disordered patterns display both overall and homotypic hyperuniformity , i.e. , the system is multi - hyperuniform .",
    "this singular property implies that if any subset of the individual species is removed from the overall population , the remaining pattern is still hyperuniform .",
    "importantly , it is highly nontrivial to devise an algorithm that would remove a large fraction of the points from a disordered hyperuniform system while leaving the remaining point pattern hyperuniform , and yet nature has found such a design .    until now",
    ", the property of _ overall _ hyperuniformity was identified only in a special subset of disordered physical systems , including ground - state liquid helium @xcite , one - component plasmas @xcite , harrison - zeldovich power spectrum of the density fluctuations of the early universe @xcite , fermionic ground states @xcite , classical disordered ground states @xcite , and maximally random jammed packings of equal - sized hard particles @xcite .",

    "it is likely that some other epithelial tissues and phyllotactic systems @xcite possess such attributes .",
    "interestingly , it has been shown that the large - scale number - density fluctuations associated with the malignant cells in brain tumors are significantly suppressed , although the cell patterns in such brain tumors are not hyperuniform @xcite .",
    "in addition , the photoreceptor patterns possess quasi - long - range ( qlr ) correlations as indicated by the linear small-@xmath11 behavior in @xmath12 .",

    "it is believe that the qlr correlations arise from the competition between the requirement of jamming and maximal disorder in the system @xcite .",
    "as we showed employing the unique multiscale packing model , the multicomponent avian system that is both homotypic and overall hyperuniform , i.e. , multi - hyperuniform , can result from two competing interactions between the photoreceptors .",

    "the fact that a disordered hyperuniform pattern corresponds to a local optimum associated with the multiscale packing problem indicates that such a pattern may represent the most uniform sampling arrangement attainable in the avian system , instead of the theoretical optimal solution of a regular hexagonal array .",
    "specifically , our studies show how fundamental physical constraints can change the course of a biological optimization process .",
    "although it is clear that physical cell packing constraints are the likely cause of the short - range hard - core repulsion , the origin of the effective longer - range soft - core repulsion is less obvious .",
    "we hypothesize that repulsive forces of this type occur during retinal development and may be secondary to cell - cell interactions during photoreceptor neurogenesis . however , a comprehensive test of this hypothesis is beyond the scope of this investigation , and therefore its resolution represents a fascinating avenue for future research .",
    "recent studies have shown that disordered hyperuniform materials can be created that possess unique optical properties , such as being `` stealthy '' ( i.e. , transparent to incident radiation at certain wavelengths ) @xcite . moreover ,",
    "such disordered hyperuniform point patterns have been employed to design isotropic disordered network materials that possess complete photonic band gaps ( blocking all directions and polarizations of light ) comparable in size to those in photonic crystals @xcite . while the physics of these systems are not directly related to the avian photoreceptor patterns ,",
    "such investigations and our present findings demonstrate that a class of disordered hyperuniform materials are endowed with novel photonic properties .    besides capturing the unusual structural features of photoreceptor patterns , our multiscale packing model represents a unique algorithm that allows one to generate multi - hyperuniform multicomponent systems with varying degrees of order by tuning the packing fraction @xmath82 of the hard - core exclusion regions ( see appendix for additional examples ) .",
    "this knowledge could now be exploited to produce multi - hyperuniform disordered structures for applications in condensed matter physics and materials science .",

    "note that in our model , in the infinite - dilute limit @xmath83 , i.e. , in the absence of the hard - core exclusion effects , the inherent structures associated with the remaining _ long - range soft - core repulsion _ are triangular lattice arrangements of points , which are in fact the most hyperuniform point configurations in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "as the hard - core exclusion regions for each species grow in size ( i.e. , @xmath82 increases ) , the degree of spatial order will be gradually reduced due to the aforementioned geometrical frustrations caused by the hard cores , while the system remains hyperuniform and disordered up to some packing fraction @xmath84 .",

    "<S> we have devised a unique multiscale cell packing model in two dimensions that suggests that photoreceptor types interact with both short- and long - ranged repulsive forces and that the resultant competition between the types gives rise to the aforementioned singular spatial features characterizing the system , including multi - hyperuniformity . </S>",
    "<S> these findings suggest that a disordered hyperuniform pattern may represent the most uniform sampling arrangement attainable in the avian system , given intrinsic packing constraints within the photoreceptor epithelium . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , they show how fundamental physical constraints can change the course of a biological optimization process . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that multi - hyperuniform disordered structures have implications for the design of materials with novel physical properties and therefore may represent a fruitful area for future research . </S>"
