    "quenching probes are standard tools for measuring and evaluating the cooling intensity of various liquid and gas quenchants .",
    "they are equipped with one or more thermocouples , that measure and record the temperature curves at selected positions in the probe throughout the whole quenching period of time . the cooling rate , i.e.",
    ", the time derivative of the temperature at a particular point , can be estimated from the measured cooling curve by approximate numerical differentiation .",
    "these two curves ( in time ) are the basis of all cooling curve tests @xcite .",
    "because the calculation of all relevant data is relatively simple , for many years , such tests have been the most useful means for a quick characterization of quenchants , without estimating the actual cooling conditions at the surface  where the heat extraction occurs . in modern times ,",
    "when the computing power is much greater , standard cooling curve tests are becoming inadequate for accurate simulation and control of the quenching conditions in industrial applications .",
    "the cooling ability of a quenchant is characterized by the heat flux between the hot metal surface and the quenchant .",
    "an appropriate model for this heat extraction is newton s law of cooling @xcite , combined with fourier s law of heat conduction @xmath36 where :    * @xmath32 = surface heat flux density , @xmath31 , considered positive when the probe cools , * @xmath35 = unit outer vector perpendicular to the surface , * @xmath20 = surface temperature at a particular point , @xmath16 or @xmath17 , * @xmath19 = external temperature of the quenchant , @xmath16 or @xmath17 , and * @xmath33 = heat transfer coefficient ( htc ) at the surface , @xmath34 .",
    "the htc is regarded as the measure of the cooling power of a quenchant , and eq  1 is used as the boundary condition in numerical simulation of the quenching process , involving solution of the heat conduction equation to predict the hardness of steels ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the reference htc curves for various quenchants and quenching conditions can be estimated by solving the inverse heat conduction problem ( ihcp ) , where the boundary condition is reconstructed from available input data  one or more measured cooling curves gathered by a particular probe .",
    "an overview of different methods for calculating the htc is given in @xcite .",
    "however , there are several practical problems common to all methods .    in all experiments ,",
    "temperatures are measured only at a few points in the probe .",
    "it is well known that intensive quenching is not a regular process , and quenching conditions , i.e. , the actual htc values , may be very different at various places on the surface @xcite . as a consequence , regardless of the method , all calculated htcs are some approximations and should be interpreted and used with some caution .",
    "the only way to increase the reliability of estimated htcs is by repeating the measurements in similar quenching conditions .",
    "the calculation of the htc from measured temperature curves is an ill - posed problem , meaning that the solution is not well - determined by the input data , and it is very sensitive to measurement errors and small perturbations of the data .",
    "therefore , some form of model transformation and regularization is necessary to obtain a useful solution .",
    "measured cooling curves are the main input data , and any noise in these curves is very likely to be magnified in the calculated htc curves .",
    "so , the most common initial regularization step is to apply some smoothing procedure to reduce or eliminate the so - called random noise in these data .",
    "a general approach to both smoothing and approximation of measured temperatures is described in @xcite .",
    "earlier , the effect of different smoothing techniques was analyzed in @xcite .",
    "many of the results published in the literature about the htc are based on relatively small probes , that have only one thermocouple located at the center of the probe ( like the iso 9950 probe ) .",
    "the so - called damping effect frequently results in underestimated peak htc values .",
    "an agreement of the results computed by various methods for the htc calculation is observed , as in @xcite , only when the temperature is measured very near or at the surface of the probe .",
    "finally , the htc values for small probes are much larger then those for larger probes . from the discussion in @xcite",
    ", it follows that the results obtained with small probes have a limited applicability for quenching of much larger pieces in industrial processes .",
    "apart from that , relatively little is known about the sensitivity of the htc calculation with respect to all other parameters of the problem , especially when larger probes are used , so that all simple methods for the htc calculation are not feasible .",
    "the aim of this paper is to fill that gap in the literature and provide some information about the sensitivity of the htc calculation procedure , and , hopefully , of the htc itself , with respect to some of the variables involved in the quenching process .",
    "the power of numerical simulation is used to perform a number of `` experiments '' that would be very expensive or even impossible to do in real life , with real probes in actual quenching conditions . to increase the practical value of the results ,",
    "the initial cooling curves are based on the actual data recorded by the a large probe designed for characterization of industrial quenching processes @xcite .",
    "it must be said immediately that this approach is prone to systematic errors in the model and in the software implementation , but it is believed that such errors , if they exist , affect all the experiments in a similar way , so that the results of the sensitivity analysis ( with small perturbations ) are still reasonably accurate . to verify that , the same type of tests is applied to the actual htc calculation algorithm .",
    "a brief description of the probe and the htc calculation is given in the next section , followed by some general sensitivity concerns that influence the design and the scope of all experiments .",
    "the results of individual experiments are presented in subsequent sections .    even though the experiments are based on the data gathered by a particular probe , in only two liquid quenchants , and conducted with a particular algorithm for solving the ihcp",
    ", the results presented here should be relevant for other quenchants and other algorithms , that are based on similar principles .",
    "complete descriptions of the  and the htc calculation procedure are given in @xcite , and will be only briefly summarized here .",
    "the probe is a @xmath37 long cylinder with the diameter @xmath38 , made of an austenitic nickel  chromium  iron superalloy ( inconel 600 is a trademark of special metals corporation , usa . ] , uns n06600 ) , that does not have phase transformations with the latent heat involved .",
    "the near - surface temperature , denoted by @xmath18 ( @xmath17 ) , is measured in time @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) at the depth @xmath39 below the surface , with the highest frequency of @xmath40 measurements per second .",
    "two additional temperatures curves are measured in the probe , one at the depth of @xmath41 below the surface , and the other one at the center ( core ) .",
    "the external quenchant temperature @xmath19 is also known , usually as a constant value at the beginning of the quenching test .    to compensate for the lack of input data ,",
    "the whole calculation is based on a simplified one - dimensional ( 1d ) model of heat conduction .",
    "the probe is considered as a long , radially symmetrical cylinder , with the radius @xmath42 , and it is assumed that the temperature @xmath15 inside the cylinder , for all times @xmath43 , depends only on the radial distance @xmath44 $ ] from the center of the cylinder .",
    "the temperature distribution @xmath45 inside the cylinder is determined by the one - dimensional heat conduction equation ( hce ) , written in polar coordinates without the angular component @xmath46 where @xmath24 , @xmath26 , and @xmath22 are thermal properties of the material :    * @xmath24 = specific heat , @xmath25 , * @xmath26 = density , @xmath27 , and * @xmath22 = thermal conductivity , @xmath23 .",
    "as will be shown in one of the sensitivity tests , these properties must be taken as temperature dependent , i.e. , as functions of @xmath15 .    before each quenching test , the probe is initially heated to about @xmath47 , and the initial condition @xmath48 at the start of the quenching process is known .",
    "usually , it is assumed that the probe is uniformly heated , so @xmath49 is constant .    from the radial symmetry assumption , the boundary condition at the center ( @xmath50 ) must be @xmath51 and the htc @xmath33 at the surface depends only on time @xmath0 . the boundary condition eq  1 at the surface ( @xmath52 )",
    "can then be written as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the ( calculated ) surface temperature , and @xmath19 is the measured quenchant temperature .",
    "the purpose of the probe is to provide further insight into the actual quenching conditions at the surface . to this aim",
    ", the htc is calculated from local information , i.e. , from the near - surface temperature @xmath18 , by the so - called solution extension .",
    "the remaining two measured curves are used only to verify the computed temperature distribution , but not in the actual htc calculation .    in this approach",
    ", the computed @xmath33 is very sensitive to the local surface conditions , and this may give somewhat poorer results far away from the surface . on the other hand ,",
    "it avoids the damping effect deeper in the probe , it is quite fast in practice , and ideally suited for sensitivity tests .",
    "the original temperatures are measured at discrete times , until some final time @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) , when the probe is sufficiently cool . before the htc calculation",
    ", the near - surface temperature is smoothed over the whole time range @xmath55 $ ] , and this smoothing is the only regularization in the algorithm .",
    "the smoothed near - surface temperature curve , also denoted by @xmath18 , is the main input for the htc calculation .",
    "the hce ( eq  2 ) is written as the heat conservation law for the cylinder @xmath56 the numerical solution of eq  5 is based on the finite volume method ( fvm ) @xcite , because it is easy to incorporate both boundary conditions eqs  3 and 4 in terms of the heat flux density , and , by doing so , avoid explicit numerical differentiation of temperature at the surface in eq  4 .    the whole computation is performed in four nested loops . from a global perspective , the solution progresses in a series of discrete time levels @xmath3 ( @xmath1 ) , from the initial level @xmath57 , until the final time is reached .",
    "* in the outermost loop , the algorithm advances by one time level per step , with the time step @xmath58 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the solution at the new time level @xmath3 is computed from the solution at the previous level @xmath59 .",
    "* at each time level @xmath3 , the surface heat flux density @xmath60 is calculated iteratively , until the resulting temperature at the position @xmath61 is equal to the smoothed near - surface temperature @xmath62 .",
    "the numerical solution of this equation is done by the brent ",
    "dekker method @xcite , and these iterations constitute the middle loop of the algorithm . * for each value of the surface heat flux density @xmath60 , generated by the brent ",
    "dekker iterations , the remaining two loops compute the temperature distribution over the selected space discretization",
    " finite volumes that determine the space grid , in the whole interval @xmath63 $ ] , by solving the direct hce problem , written as eq  5 for all finite volumes .",
    "the first inner loop performs simple iterations to adjust all thermal properties to new temperatures at time @xmath3 , until they are stabilized . * in each of these iterations , thermal properties at all space - grid points are treated as known .",
    "the innermost loop then computes the approximate temperatures at all space - grid points , by solving a tridiagonal linear system of equations .",
    "step 2 is the key step for solving the ihcp , as it computes the unknown surface heat flux density @xmath60 in the boundary condition .",
    "effectively , it performs a solution extension on the interval @xmath64 $ ] from the near - surface position to the surface , over the space gap of length @xmath12 .",
    "that determines the temperature distribution , including the surface temperature @xmath65 .",
    "after that , the htc @xmath33 , as a function of time , is obtained directly from eq  4 , by using the input @xmath19 value .",
    "this method for the solution of the ihcp is especially adapted for large probes with the reference thermocouple located very close to the surface , so that the solution extension toward the surface is performed over a small space gap with respect to the whole radius of the probe .",
    "it is not suitable for small probes with a central thermocouple .",
    "because the htc calculation is an ill - posed problem , and high sensitivity is expected , before doing any sensitivity tests , every effort has to be made to recognize and possibly eliminate all issues that may influence the validity of the results .",
    "an actual experiment by the probe is subject to many factors that are beyond control , and may affect the results . as an example , the radial symmetry assumption requires strictly vertical immersion of the probe , and vertical agitation of the quenchant . both assumptions are often violated in practice , resulting in an asymmetrical temperature distribution . for such reasons ,",
    "sensitivity tests must be conducted in a carefully controlled environment , that is not affected by experimental errors , and they can not be done by comparing the computed results with measured temperatures . the only reasonable way to do them is by numerical simulation , i.e. , by using the same method that is used for the htc calculation .",
    "the goal of the sensitivity analysis is to determine just how sensitive are various output results with respect to reasonably small perturbations of the input data .",
    "these results are used to judge the reliability and numerical stability of the method , and how accurate is the computation of output from input .",
    "however , this should not be confused with the true accuracy of the results .",
    "for example , the computed htc may be nowhere near the true value , which is quite hard to find , anyway .",
    "that has to be verified independently  by practical experiments and other computational methods .",
    "once it has been verified that the results are reasonably accurate , then the sensitivity results for the calculation procedure can be extended into some conclusions about the sensitivity of the htc itself . in that respect ,",
    "a comparison of the other two measured temperatures with the computed results @xcite confirms that the results are satisfactory , within the limits of the simplified 1d model used for calculation .      to obtain good results , before the test ,",
    "all the data has to be prepared carefully , to avoid any potential numerical instabilities in the method , that may be caused by inappropriate data , and the method has to be guarded against such instabilities , as much as possible .",
    "most of the numerical methods for solving the hce , including the fvm and the finite difference methods , are very sensitive to the lack of smoothness in the initial and boundary conditions , and in the coefficients of the equation , i.e. , in the thermal properties of the material .",
    "the cause of that lies in the assumed smoothness of the solution ( temperature ) that is required to ensure the validity of the equation that is being solved  in this case , eq  2 or eq  5 .",
    "the standard smoothness requirement is that the temperature must be continuously differentiable in time ( the so - called @xmath66 smoothness ) .",
    "it should be noted that this type of sensitivity has nothing to do with the ill - posedness of the htc calculation .",
    "the method used for the htc calculation is extremely sensitive to the smoothness of the near - surface temperature curve @xmath67 , for several additional reasons , related to the ill - posedness of the problem .",
    "this curve is the only input used in the essential part of the computation to determine the surface heat flux density @xmath60 , and @xmath19 is used only to calculate @xmath68 from @xmath60 .",
    "the surface conditions are estimated from local information , and @xmath62 plays the role of an `` internal '' reference condition for the solution extension . as",
    "the gap is very small , every small wiggle in the input @xmath67 curve is reflected and magnified in the computed @xmath69 curve . because there is no other ( explicit or implicit ) regularization involved in the solution of the ihcp , the near - surface temperature curve @xmath67 must be sufficiently smooth  at least continuously differentiable ( @xmath66 smoothness ) .",
    "therefore , the smoothing of @xmath18 is an essential part of the data preparation .",
    "it is interesting that the results , including the htc , are not very sensitive to the choice of the smoothing method , as long as the input curve is sufficiently smooth , and the errors in the approximation of the original measured data are sufficiently small .",
    "for example , the reference cooling curves in the next section are prepared by using the cubic spline least - squares approximation @xcite , which is twice continuously differentiable ( @xmath70 smoothness ) , while the software that comes with the probe uses exponential @xmath66 splines @xcite .",
    "the differences in the htc are almost negligible , and strictly confined to the high temperature gradients portion of the quenching process",
    ".    on the other hand , all local smoothing methods , such as moving averages and local polynomial least - squares approximations , also known as the savitzky - golay filters @xcite , just damp the noise in the data , and the resulting curve may turn out to be insufficiently smooth .    at the beginning of the calculation  at the first time level , it is important to ensure a smooth transition from the initial condition to the boundary or the reference condition , that is used later on .",
    "consequently , to avoid any jumps at the start , the actual value of the initial temperature @xmath49 is taken from the smoothed temperature curve as @xmath71 . because the initial temperature is assumed to be constant over the whole interval @xmath63 $ ]",
    ", the heat flux density @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) between all control volumes , and the initial surface heat flux density @xmath72 must all be equal to zero .",
    "moreover , the same must hold for the first derivative of the temperature , @xmath73 , and this constraint is added in the initial smoothing and approximation of the near - surface temperature curve .",
    "the experience shows that even a small violation of these conditions causes severe oscillations of the computed solution near the surface for the first few time steps .",
    "this may be seen as the numerical instability of the method , but it is just an expected reaction to non - smooth conditions , and can be avoided by proper data preparation .",
    "a similar thing can happen at any time , particularly when intensive cooling begins .",
    "all sudden changes in temperature must be @xmath66-smooth , at least on the time scale involved in the numerical solution .",
    "when such oscillations in the solution appear , what happens afterwards , depends on the choice of the time advancement method in the outermost loop of the algorithm .",
    "there are three standard choices for the numerical solution of the hce @xcite , and they will be described with their usual names , and in terms of numerical time - integration rules ( which are used in the fvm implementation ) .    * explicit method ( first - point rule for time integration ) is stable , i.e. , damps these oscillations , only when extremely small time steps are used , and the calculation becomes prohibitively slow . * implicit method ( last - point rule for time integration ) is unconditionally stable , so large time steps can be used .",
    "any oscillations are relatively quickly damped in a few time steps , but the damage is done in all computed values . typically , the surface temperature @xmath74 is not monotone , and the jumps are amplified in @xmath75 and @xmath69 curves . an additional smoothing may be required to remove these artificial oscillations . *",
    "crank  nicolson method ( trapezoidal rule for time integration ) is , nominally , more accurate than the previous methods .",
    "however , it turned out to be very sensitive and unstable  the oscillations always appear and quickly blow up , causing numerical overflow exception .",
    "the implicit method is used in all htc calculations .",
    "eventual numerical oscillations can be avoided by appropriate smoothing and handling of data . in all the tests reported here ,",
    "such instabilities have never occured .",
    "the values of thermal properties , that appear as coefficients in the hce , are known only for a small number of temperatures . before use",
    ", these tables have to be converted into functions of temperature over the whole temperature range .",
    "two such functions are needed , one for the so - called volumetric specific heat @xmath76 ( @xmath29 ) , and one for the thermal conductivity @xmath22 .",
    "based on the data from @xcite for inconel 600 , these functions have been computed by akima s piecewise cubic @xmath66 interpolation @xcite .",
    "the same can be done by any other form of interpolation ( or even approximation ) that gives the global @xmath66 smoothness , such as cubic spline interpolation @xcite , but not with piecewise linear interpolation .    even though it is the most commonly used method for converting tables into functions , the piecewise linear interpolation should be avoided in the htc calculation , not only for thermal properties , but also for temperatures in time or space .",
    "the resulting curve is continuous , but its derivative has jumps at the interpolation nodes , so it is not @xmath66-smooth . as a result",
    ", such interpolation of thermal properties may drastically increase the number of brent  dekker and simple iterations required in steps  2 and  3 of the algorithm .",
    "numerical experiments for sensitivity tests consist of computing and comparing relevant output results for different values of various input parameters of the problem .",
    "strictly speaking , the htc calculation has only two inputs : the smoothed near - surface cooling curve @xmath67 , and the ( constant ) quenchant temperature @xmath19 . in practice , everything else is fixed , as determined by the design of the probe .",
    "the main advantage of numerical experiments is that they can go beyond that .",
    "anything that can be considered as an input , or as a parameter of the problem , can be changed and varied , including all numerical parameters in the method .    in this approach to the htc calculation , the input cooling curve characterizes the whole quenching process in a particular quenchant , and it is obvious that the surface heat flux density and the htc critically depend on it .",
    "but , this dependence is not the target of the tests .",
    "taking different input cooling curves is equivalent to changing quenchants and quenching conditions , and that must be based on the actual data , not on numerical simulation .    instead of playing with fictive curves representing fictive quenchants , to avoid any misinterpretation of the results , only two cooling curves with fixed corresponding quenchant temperatures",
    "are used in all tests .",
    "they have been chosen to represent two different liquid quenchants that lie at the opposite ends of quenching intensity :    * mineral oil , non - accelerated and without agitation , with the peak htc value of about @xmath77 , and * water , with the peak htc value of almost @xmath78 .",
    "most other liquid quenchants are somewhere in between these two .",
    "a smoothed reference cooling curve has been prepared for each quenchant , based on several measurements by the probe , and then smoothed with all the necessary constraints , as described in the previous section .",
    "this means that only two different inputs ( in the strict sense ) are used for all tests .    with these two inputs , that represent two actual quenchants ,",
    "the main objective of numerical tests is to find the sensitivity of output with respect to all other parameters of the problem , that can not be changed easily in practice .",
    "the following five groups of experiments have been conducted by performing a selected set of variations of the corresponding parameter :    * thermal properties of the material , used in the hce to calculate the results . * the depth @xmath12 of the near - surface thermocouple , without changing the reference temperatures @xmath18 and @xmath19 , as if the same temperatures @xmath67 are measured at a different position . * the diameter @xmath10 of the probe , with the same depth @xmath12 . * the space step @xmath13 , to test the sensitivity of the calculation ( the innermost loop of the algorithm ) . *",
    "the time step @xmath6 between successive time levels , to test the sensitivity of the calculation ( the outermost loop of the algorithm ) .",
    "the underlying motivation for each group of tests will be discussed along with the results in the next section .",
    "the usual output of the calculation consists of htc and surface heat flux density curves , together with a number of calculated temperature curves at various points on the radius of the probe .",
    "for the purpose of sensitivity analysis , just four of these curves will be considered , and all of them as a function of time @xmath0 :    * calculated core temperature ( for @xmath50 ) , denoted by @xmath21 ( @xmath17 ) , * calculated surface temperature ( for @xmath52 ) , denoted by @xmath20 ( @xmath17 ) , * calculated htc @xmath33 , * calculated surface heat flux density @xmath32 .",
    "the core temperature @xmath21 is taken as a representative of what happens far away from the surface , while the last three curves represent the behavior at the surface .",
    "there are several good reasons why the htc is considered only as a function of time . in gas quenching , which is controllable in time , this the natural state of affairs .",
    "on the other hand , in liquid quenching , the htc is often taken as a function of the surface temperature @xmath20 .",
    "but , from the computational point of view , the htc is always computed first as a function of time , and then converted into a function of @xmath20 , provided that the surface temperature is monotone decreasing in time .",
    "unfortunately , for some polymer solutions , this is not always the case @xcite , and requires additional efforts to get the htc as a function of @xmath20 . finally , in sensitivity tests",
    ", it is much easier to compare the differences in computed htcs on the fixed time - scale , when only one thing is changed , not two .",
    "the sensitivity is measured in the absolute sense  as the difference between the computed results . to simplify the whole procedure , only one set of output results , computed with standard values of all parameters ,",
    "will be taken as the reference set for each quenchant ( cooling curve ) .",
    "all other results for perturbed data will be compared with these reference results , and only the difference between the reference curve and the `` perturbed '' curve will be shown .",
    "the results will be presented in a graphical format , in hope that a picture tells a thousand words .",

    "they are caused by the actual phenomenon at the surface , when the quenchant layer near the surface becomes sufficiently cool to stop boiling , and only sporadic vapor bubbles are formed , before it turns into the entirely liquid state .",
    "this sections contains the computed results for all five groups of sensitivity tests .",
    "the results for each group are presented in a separate subsection .",

    ", they have to be adjusted repeatedly , to reflect the correct thermal behavior .",
    "therefore , the htc calculation contains an additional loop ( step  3 of the algorithm ) to perform this adjustment by simple iterations . as a consequence ,",
    "the whole computation is slowed down significantly .    in order to speed up the calculation ,",
    "it is quite popular in practice to take constant values of thermal properties at some fixed temperature .",
    "one of the objectives of this test is to see how that affects the solution .",
    "the output curves are computed by taking all thermal properties for inconel 600 as constant values , first at the room temperature of @xmath88 , and then at @xmath89 , which is much closer to the actual temperature of intensive cooling .",
    "this test , of course , is impossible to do in practice , but it is essential for the htc calculation procedure .    on the other hand , for practical applications , it is far more interesting to see what happens when the material of the probe is changed from one steel to another , which is quite expensive to do in real life .",
    "so , in the third test , the probe is considered to be made of aisi 304 stainless steel , instead of inconel 600 . because aisi 304 is composed mostly of iron , the actual thermal properties are somewhat different at the same temperatures @xcite , but both steels exhibit quite similar behavior when quenched .",

    "the reference curves are computed from the near - surface temperature @xmath18 measured at the depth @xmath39 below the surface . when the probe is manufactured , it is quite hard to achieve the exact drilling and positioning of the near - surface thermocouple , and some small differences in the depth can be expected in practice . moreover ,",

    "the depth changes are small with respect to the whole radius of the probe , and they happen far away from the core , so the core temperature @xmath21 is only marginally affected .",

    "however , there are at least two reasons why it is worth doing .",
    "exactly because the diameter is fixed , someone may be tempted to use the same output curves for an actual piece of a different size , without being aware of the errors that might cause ( it is has been tried in practice ) . from a more positive point of view , this sensitivity test will give at least some indications about the possibility of using the results for other pieces , without actually doing the tests with different probes .",

    "therefore , it is reflected mostly in the core temperature .",
    "the surface conditions are less affected , especially the surface temperature .",

    "surface heat flux densities in fig .",
    "[ wat_rad_flux ] do not exhibit this behavior , and their values ( as well as differences with respect to the original unperturbed values ) nicely tend to zero for high times .",
    "the explanation for high , possibly unbounded , htc values for high times comes from eq  4 , where the htc is calculated as @xmath102 the denominator , i.e. , the difference between the surface and the quenchant temperatures , also tends to zero for high times , and there is no apparent physical reason that the htc should be bounded at the time limit .",
    "finally , actual experiments with probes having different diameters , from @xmath103 to @xmath104 , but of the same design , and in the same quenching conditions , reported in @xcite , show that the htc curves are more similar than the sensitivity results suggest .",

    ", the central volume may be twice as wide , to get an integral number of intervals ( volumes ) over the whole radius .",
    "usually , the results are computed with @xmath107 extension intervals , or with the space step @xmath108 , giving a total of @xmath109 volumes over the radius of the probe . in this group of tests , the following four values of @xmath14 are taken in eq  7 : @xmath110 the space step @xmath13 varies from @xmath92 to @xmath111 , and the total number of volumes varies from @xmath112 to @xmath113 .",

    "high differences in the htcs are strictly confined to the intensive cooling period , and large peaks are obtained only when a single extension interval is used . in all other cases , the differences may be considered as negligible , for all practical purposes .    the method becomes slightly less stable with a very large number of extension intervals ( @xmath116 ) , and the usual value of @xmath117 extension intervals turns out to be a good choice .",
    "the overall space accuracy of the method is reasonably high , proportional to @xmath118 .",

    "several other methods for the solution of the ihcp have been tested , as well .",
    "for example , the finite difference method @xcite gives very similar results , with the same discretization parameters , provided that an accurate algorithm for numerical differentiation is used to calculate the surface heat flux density .",
    "several numerical experiments have been performed to test the sensitivity of the htc calculation with respect to the main input parameters of the problem , including the numerical discretization parameters involved in numerical solution of the problem .",
    "the results confirm that the numerical procedure itself is reliable and numerically stable , so it can be used for the solution of the ihcp to obtain reasonably accurate htc curves , from properly prepared data .",
    "the measured temperature curves have to be adequately smoothed , and thermal properties of the material must be temperature - dependent to obtain good results .",
    "all sensitivity tests have been conducted with realistic cooling curves from two quenchants , and the results with respect to the position of the near - surface thermocouple , and the diameter of the probe , may provide some interesting information about the behavior of the htc in various liquid quenchants .",
