    "maximum entropy techniques have proved useful in attempts to extract boson information either from angular resolved photo emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) data or from the optical conductivity.@xcite what is recovered is the electron - boson spectral density , @xmath3 , which describes the effective interaction between two electrons due to the exchange of a boson which could be a phonon , a spin fluctuation , or some other excitation such as a plasmon . in this way",
    "one can obtain some insight into the nature of this interaction and by implication about mechanism of superconductivity .",
    "in particular , coupling to a resonance peak in @xmath3 can lead to peaks or kinks in measured quantities .",
    "as we will see , even a structureless background can be picked up in our inversion process .",
    "other approaches to the analysis of such structures have also been applied , see for example mishchenko and nagaosa@xcite who employed the @xmath4-model .",
    "arpes gives information on the quasiparticle self energy while optical data can be expressed in terms of an optical self energy which is related to , but is different from the quasiparticle self energy .",
    "there are two main differences .",
    "the first is that optics involves the current - current correlation function which can be expressed in terms of a two particle green s function and there can be vertex corrections while arpes requires only the knowledge of the one - particle green s function .",
    "optics deals with a transport process and transport lifetimes are not the same as quasiparticle lifetimes . for example , the effectiveness of a scattering process in depleting a current depends strongly on the final state , i.e. : backward as opposed to forward scattering . secondly , optics deals with a momentum average while arpes is momentum specific .",
    "there are other complications : arpes measures renormalized quasiparticle energies directly and to extract from this data the quasiparticle self energy it is necessary to know the bare dispersion relation .",
    "often , for energies not too far from the chemical potential , a linear dispersion is assumed and its slope is determined from an assumption that the self energy crosses zero at some energy @xmath5mev in the recent high accuracy data in bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 ( bi2212).@xcite a similar ambiguity arises in optics : to get the optical self energy from the reflectivity data it is necessary to specify a value for the dielectric constant @xmath6 at infinity . also the plasma frequency is needed and this quantity is not so well known in the cuprates . in some determination it requires an assumption about where the band of interest ends as there are overlaps with higher bands , creating ambiguity .",
    "certainly we are dealing with a finite band situation . for",
    "a simple first neighbor only tight binding band with hoping @xmath7 , the band width @xmath8 .",
    "estimates based on tight binding fits to local density approximation ( lda ) band structure calculations give values of the order of @xmath9mev , ref .  [ ] for @xmath7 while fits to experiment can give somewhat smaller values of order @xmath10mev . in all cases , of course , higher nearest neighbor hoping is also present .",
    "so far maximum entropy inversion techniques have involved using as an effective low energy theory for the self energy , the eliashberg equation generalized to include any boson - exchange mechanism and not just phonons .",
    "but these are written for infinite bands .",
    "a deficiency of such an approach is that the self energy can not change sign in an infinite band nor can its optical counterpart . on the other hand in finite band formulations a change of sign",
    "occurs naturally and is a robust feature of the formulation.@xcite in early arpes experiments the real part of the quasiparticle self energy was simply assumed to go to zero at @xmath11mev . in the work of meevasana _",
    "et al._@xcite for the la@xmath12sr@xmath13cuo@xmath14 ( lsco ) series the renormalized dispersions were found to cross the bare lda bands at most dopings considered , with the energy of the crossing falling roughly in the range of 400 to @xmath15mev .",
    "further , in the bi2212 series of hwang _",
    "et al._@xcite the optical self energy was also found to go through zero . on the theoretical side cappelutti and",
    "pietronero@xcite noted that in an electron - phonon model the real part of the self energy always goes through a zero at some finite energy .",
    "later knigavko and carbotte@xcite established that for coupling to an einstein mode the zero occurs at @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the frequency of the oscillator . for optics",
    "the crossing is at higher energies , @xmath18 times its quasiparticle counterpart to logarithmic accuracy .    in this paper",
    "we start by generalizing the maximum entropy inversion technique for the quasiparticle self energy used by shi _",
    "et al._@xcite to finite bands .",
    "we use this new formalism to study how the value of the band width @xmath19 changes results obtained for the electron - boson spectral density @xmath3 .",
    "first we consider the normal state and generalize the procedure later on to deal with superconductivity .",
    "for this purpose it is necessary to have finite @xmath19 eliashberg equations with @xmath2-wave symmetry for the superconducting gap .",
    "we use these equations to derive from the data of zhang _",
    "et al._@xcite the spectral functions @xmath3 at low temperatures in the superconducting state .",
    "the available data is for the nodal direction only . in principle",
    ", the spectral density depends on direction and so antinodal results would be expected to be different . on the other hand , optics involves a transport spectral density which is an average over all directions in momentum space . while this means that arpes and optics can not be compared directly,@xcite we , nevertheless , use the spectral density @xmath20 taken from the optical literature to get some approximate information on a quantity which should be close to the angular averaged quasiparticle self energy .",

    "furthermore , available lda calculations as well as fits to fermi surfaces also indicate bands of widths of the order of some ev . in such cases the final value of the electron - boson spectral density @xmath3 from fits to the data",
    "is significantly affected by @xmath19 .",
    "while we use a maximum entropy inversion of the convolution integral to get a first numerical model for the spectral function , in both normal and superconducting state , the eliashberg equations of appendix  [ app : a ] are employed with a parameterized model for @xmath3 and a least squares fit to the data .    in making comparison with spectral densities obtained from the optical data it is necessary to recognize that optics involves a momentum average while the arpes is for a single momentum direction ( the nodal direction in our case ) .",
    "also , the transport @xmath20 can be different from its quasiparticle counterpart .",
    "in making such a comparison we noted two main differences .",
    "one , the transport spectral density is larger in absolute values by a factor of about two .",
    "second , the resonant peak around @xmath61mev seen in both spectral densities is more pronounced in optics .",
    "we believe this to reflect the importance of the antinodal region not probed in the arpes data of zhang _",
    "et al._@xcite other than these differences there is considerable agreement between the two sets of experimental data giving some evidence that an eliashberg approach can be used as a phenomenological approach to correlate various data sets .",
    "as is widely done in this field we interpreted the arpes data directly as the electron spectral function assuming the so called ` matrix element effects ' described by lindroos _",
    "et al._@xcite to cause no serious distortion of the spectrum .",
    "furthermore , large inhomogeneities are seen in the scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) of the bi2212 compounds.@xcite although this technique probes only the surface layer , the inhomogeneities could persist in the bulk .",
    "optics is a bulk probe and would average over the inhomogeneities so that our analysis would reflect the average spectral density .",
    "the good agreement with arpes seen here could be taken as evidence that such inhomogeneities , if important , can be treated in an average way .",
    "an important contribution to the debate about mechanism of superconductivity is our finding that the coupling to a high energy background seen in optics is now confirmed in the arpes data by zhang",
