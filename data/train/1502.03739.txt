    "the position of the core is frequency dependent due to positional variation of opacity in the jet and/or surrounding medium .",
    "measuring the frequency dependence of the core shift provides information on the structure and physical conditions in sub - parsec scale jets , as well as the confinement mechanism and pressure gradients in the external medium .",
    "frequency dependent core shifts can be measured with vlbi down to scales of @xmath2 mas , or with interstellar scintillation ( iss ) down to micro - arcsecond scales .    for a scattering screen at distance @xmath3 from the observer , a frequency - dependent core shift @xmath4 will displace the scintillation patterns observed at different frequencies by a distance @xmath5 , in the opposite direction to the shift on the sky ( figure 1 ; see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* little & hewish 1966 ) ) .",
    "the scale of iss in weak scattering is determined by the angular size of the first fresnel zone , @xmath6 , typically of order 10@xmath7as for scattering screens in the range @xmath8pc which produce rapid iss of agn at frequencies of several ghz .",

    "the combined fit to frequency dependence of core shift and source size , the latter determined from the timescale of iss , implies that the jet opening angle increases with distance from the core .",
    "the results are consistent with a hydrostatically confined jet traversing a steep pressure gradient .",
    "this may help to explain the bright , relatively stable ultracompact jet in pks 1257@xmath0326 , implied by the presence of rapid iss persisting now over more than a decade .    from earlier simultaneous observations at the vla and the atca ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bignall et al . 2006 ) ) , the iss pattern is seen first at the vla and then several minutes later at the atca , with the magnitude of the time delay depending on the time of year . thus , the scintillation velocity is such that the iss pattern traverses a telescope on earth from an easterly direction ; the exact direction varying over the course of a year .",

    "* bignall & hodgson 2012 ) ) .",
    "therefore , the lower frequency iss pattern is displaced to the east of the higher frequency pattern , implying that lower frequency source component centroids are displaced to the _ west _ of the core (  [ sec - issshift ] ) . taking best - fit solutions for the scintillation parameters previously determined by @xcite from the annual cycle in characteristic timescale and the two - station time delays , the magnitude of the core shift between 4.5 and 10",
