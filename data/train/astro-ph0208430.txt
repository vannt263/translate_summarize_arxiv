    "mechanical feedback from massive stars is a fundamental driver of galaxy evolution .",
    "the supernovae ( sne ) and supersonic stellar winds from these stars generate bubbles and shells in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , which may dominate the ism structure formation in many star - forming galaxies .",
    "the standard , adiabatic model for these shells and superbubbles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predicts the production of hot , @xmath2 k , low - density gas within these shells , which bear the products of sn and massive star nucleosynthesis .",
    "therefore , these bubble structures are thought to be the source of the diffuse , hot ionized component of the ism .",
    "vigorous star - forming regions may generate supergiant shells that blow out of galaxy disks , thereby dispersing metals and mass far from the parent star formation event .",
    "in addition , this mechanical energy contributes to ism kinematics and is thought to be a primary source of turbulence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the effects of mechanical feedback have been clearly demonstrated , for example , in starburst galaxies @xcite and in superbubbles around ob associations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , several troubling discrepancies remain unsolved .",
    "for example , almost all clean examples of bubbles blown by wolf - rayet stars and of superbubbles present shells that are too small for their observed parent stellar population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "many superbubbles also show anomalous kinematics and x - ray emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to resolve these puzzles and more clearly understand the mechanical feedback process",
    ", it is therefore necessary to examine simpler systems .    in active star - forming regions ,",
    "high concentrations of ob stars collectively produce superbubbles .",
    "but in their peripheries , where stars are loosely distributed , discrete bubbles may be produced by individual stars .",
    "h@xmath0  images of hii  regions ionized by ob associations in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) have revealed large ( 50150 pc ) gas shells around the ob associations and numerous small ( @xmath3 15 pc ) , ring - like nebulae outside the large shell .",
    "these small nebulae are candidate wind - blown bubbles of single o or b stars @xcite , and offer perhaps the simplest test of the standard , adiabatic bubble model .",

    "the integrated [ oiii]/h@xmath0  ratio for the whole nebula is about 0.55 .",

    "the diffuse gas of n44f probably possesses a density of a few tens @xmath18 .    using the curtis schmidt h@xmath0  image and the flux calibration from @xcite , we measured over the entire n44f nebula an h@xmath0  flux of 3.6@xmath410@xmath31 erg  @xmath32  s@xmath6 . for a distance of 50 kpc ,",

    "a second evaluation of the extinction correction has been made by comparing radio data and the curtis schmidt h@xmath0  v ) of 0.28  mag for n44f , n44j , and n44 m is found ( j.  r.  dickel , private communication ) , and this results in a @xmath16 of 1.4@xmath410@xmath20 photons  s@xmath6 for n44f .",
    "this value suggests that the total ionizing power of the star(s ) within n44f is equivalent to a single o6.5 v ",
    "o7.5 v star @xcite .",
    "this is compatible with the rather high [ oiii]/h@xmath0  ratio : the photoionization models of @xcite for costar stellar atmosphere models suggest that the observed integrated [ oiii]/h@xmath0  ratio of n44f could be produced by the equivalent of an o8 v ",

    "the comparison to the photoionization models should however be interpreted with caution because the models do not assume a shell structure , which affects the excitation and ionization structure",
    ". the dominant spectral type could therefore be somewhat earlier than inferred from the modeled excitation .",
    "the dark clouds of n44f exhibit new examples of the intriguing finger- or pillar - like structures , similar to those reported in the eagle nebula @xcite .",
    "the most prominent two are embedded in the bright northwest region ( see figs .",
    "[ n44f ] and  [ pillars ] ) .",
    "several additional features of this type are present in the south and possibly in the southwest , but they are fainter . in fig .",
    "[ pillars ] , we present the most striking of these structures in the h@xmath0  and [ sii ]  images as well as in the ratio map .",
    "the dust columns in n44f are 5  to 10  long and 1  to 2  wide , corresponding to 1 to 2 pc long and 0.25 to 0.5 pc wide at the lmc s distance .",
    "these sizes and morphologies are similar to those seen in 30 doradus @xcite and m16 @xcite .",
    "two of these columns harbor stars at their tips , as indicated by arrows in fig .",
    "[ pillars ] .",
    "@xcite suggested that stars at the tips of pillars could be young stellar objects which were formed in the molecular cloud and finally emerge after the photoevaporation of most of their parent cloud .",
    "however , the @xcite model of pre - existing condensations in the molecular cloud does not provide the unique conditions for producing photoionized pillars .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations by @xcite illustrate that these structures can be formed by a variety of initial conditions in the structure with inhomogeneities in density and/or radiation field , but current observations do not yet permit discrimination among these different models .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to identify additional examples of such objects .",
    "other important characteristics of these dust columns are their ionization structure and their density .",
    "all of the dust columns point towards the central ionizing source , i.e. , a bright star or a small cluster between the center and the northwest edge of n44f . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ ionstruc ] , the [ sii ]  peak is separated from the h@xmath0  peak by approximately 01 , i.e. , 0.024 pc , with h@xmath0  peaking slightly closer to the source of uv radiation which is photoevaporating the cloud .",
    "the shape of these profiles is very similar to those observed in the pillars of 30 doradus , or in ground - based images of m16 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , no wfpc2 [ oiii ]  images of n44f are available , thus we can not undertake a complete analysis using photoionization models or constrain further the properties of the ionizing source . following the method used in section 3.1 , we estimate an rms density larger than 300 @xmath18 at the tip of one of the pillars .",
    "this density is compatible with that determined by @xcite in 30 doradus , 700  @xmath18 .",
    "these pillars are thus photoevaporating clouds , whose evaporated matter enhances the density and brightness of the diffuse material seen in the northwest part of the nebula .",
    "the kinematic properties of n44f are derived from the high - dispersion echelle observations of the h@xmath0  and [ nii ]  @xmath126583 lines .",
    "the [ nii ]  line has a smaller thermal width than the h@xmath0  line , thus it shows the line splitting better although it is noisier .",
    "we have extracted h@xmath0  and [ nii ]  line profiles and fitted them with gaussian components . the resultant velocity - position plot ( fig .",
    "[ specn44 ] ) shows that n44f is an expanding shell with a radius of 22 , coincident with the outer ring described in  3.1 .",
    "both lines indicate a shell expansion velocity of @xmath1112 ^-1 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "an example of the [ nii ]  and h@xmath0  profiles are presented in fig .",
    "the approaching ( blueshifted ) component is fainter , suggesting a lower density .",
    "further east , outside n44f , an additionnal blue component is present , but it is probably associated with the complex filamentary structure at the outskirts of n44 and is not directly related to n44f .",
    "n44f has a classical ring - nebula morphology , and its kinematics confirms an expanding shell , most likely created by the wind of the early - type massive star(s ) within this bubble .",
    "we can now test whether the observed expansion dynamics of this bubble are consistent with those expected from the standard , adiabatic bubble model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "with the observed radius @xmath27 in units of pc and expansion velocity @xmath35 in units of ^-1 km  s@xmath6 , we can compute the dynamical timescale @xmath36 in units of 10@xmath37 yr using @xmath38 , and further determine the ratio of stellar wind luminosity @xmath39 in units of 10@xmath40 ergs  s@xmath6 to ambient density @xmath41 in units of h - atom  @xmath18 , using @xmath42 .    for a radius of 5.3 pc and an expansion velocity of @xmath1112 ^-1 km  s@xmath6 , n44f has a dynamical timescale of 2.7@xmath410@xmath43 yr and a @xmath44 ratio of 0.016 ergss@xmath6@xmath45 .",
    "if we assume that the shell consists of mass swept up from the volume , the ambient density , @xmath41 , can be estimated by @xmath46 , where @xmath17 is the rms density of the shell , @xmath28 the shell thickness , and @xmath27 the shell radius . for @xmath4740 @xmath18 and @xmath48 ( see section 3.1 ) , we derive an ambient density of @xmath1130 @xmath18 and a wind luminosity of @xmath115@xmath410@xmath49 ergs  s@xmath6 .",
    "this wind luminosity is compatible with that expected from the spectral type determined in section 3.1 , i.e. , an o7v star @xcite .",
    "one uncertainty in these estimates is the shell thickness ; however , even if the shell thickness is off by a factor of two , the predicted wind luminosity will still be compatible , within the errors , with an o7v star .",
    "thus , the dynamics of n44f appear to be consistent with the standard adiabatic model for bubble evolution , within uncertainties generated by the complex interstellar environment .",
    "this contrasts with the results from superbubbles , which show evidence of retarded growth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to investigate further this discrepancy",
    ", it is worth considering an alternative bubble model .",
    "the presence of dust pillars around n44f clearly indicates a highly inhomogeneous ism .",
    "the photoevaporation of the dense clumps may serve as an energy sink and govern the dynamic evolution of this hii  region .",
    "since photoevaporation processes take place in the early evolutionary stages of a bubble / superbubble , the energy loss by photoevaporation may explain the smaller - than - expected sizes of previously studied superbubbles and wolf - rayet ring nebulae ( see  1 ) .",
    "therefore , we will now consider models of bubbles formed in a cloudy medium by @xcite . in their models ,",
    "only bubbles blown by stars with weak winds will follow the weaver et al .",
    "model , while stars with stronger winds will produce bubbles whose expansion is governed by the dynamics of photoevaporating clouds .",
    "they define a dimensionless wind luminosity @xmath50 and a homogenization radius @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the wind luminosity in erg  s@xmath6 , @xmath53 the ionizing flux in photons  s@xmath6 , @xmath54 the mean cloud density in @xmath18 and @xmath55 the dynamical timescale in years .",
    "strong winds possess @xmath56 and blow bubbles of radius @xmath57 .",
    "using the observed parameters of n44f ( with @xmath54=@xmath41 ) and assuming a stellar wind luminosity for an o7v star , we estimate @xmath581 and @xmath594.5  pc , close to the observed bubble s radius .",
    "this seems to suggest that the dynamics of photoevaporation actually governs the bubble s expansion .",
    "the agreement of the data with both models could be a simple coincidence , or maybe the bubble has just encountered the cloudy medium and begun the photoevaporation processes , in which case there may not be a large deviation from the weaver et al .",
    "note , however , that all these conclusions hinge upon the validity of the stellar wind luminosity , which is based on an assumed spectral type of the central star .",
    "future study of the actual stellar content of n44f is needed to place stronger constraints on the applicable bubble models .",

    "this requires an ionizing flux @xmath16 of 1.6@xmath410@xmath61 photons  s@xmath6 when adopting e(b@xmath23v)=0.11  mag , or 2.3@xmath410@xmath61 photons  s@xmath6 for e(b@xmath23v)=0.28  mag .",
    "these values are expected for an o9v  b0v type ionizing star @xcite , which is fully consistent with that suggested by the [ oiii]/h@xmath0  ratio of the nebula @xcite . assuming a spherical geometry",
    ", we derive an rms electron density of @xmath1125 @xmath18 , slightly less dense than n44f .",
    "the ionized gas mass of n44j is then @xmath11200 m@xmath34 .",
    "the echelle spectrum of n44j shows a kinematically quiescent hii   region .",
    "the centroids of the h@xmath0  and [ nii ]  lines are centered at 292 ^-1 km  s@xmath6 , with an rms variation of 3 ^-1 km  s@xmath6  ( see figs .",
    "[ specn44 ] and [ prof ] ) .",
    "no line splitting is seen .",
    "the observed fwhms are 27@xmath621 ^-1 km  s@xmath6  for h@xmath0  and 16@xmath622 ^-1 km  s@xmath6  for [ nii ] .",
    "these observed line widths imply a turbulent fwhm of about 10 ^-1 km  s@xmath6  for h@xmath0  and 8 ^-1 km  s@xmath6  for [ nii ]  if we take into account the instrumental profile and the thermal broadening at 10@xmath26k .",
    "the turbulence can thus explain the small variations of the centroid velocity .",
    "the difference between the turbulence widths is probably caused by a difference in the emission regions of the two lines .",
    "if n44j is actually expanding , the expansion velocity should be very small , @xmath38 ^-1 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "for such small expansion velocity , no strong compression is expected , hence no sharp filaments should be seen .",
    "finally , we may compare the observations with the standard , adiabatic bubble model .",
    "as the density in the ring - like nebula is a few tens @xmath18 , we will assume in our calculations a density of 10 @xmath18 in the ism .",
    "for an expected wind luminosity of @xmath113@xmath410@xmath63 ergs@xmath6 for an o9.5v star @xcite and with the observed 175 radius of n44j , the @xcite model predicts an expansion velocity of about 8 ^-1 km  s@xmath6  for n44j .",
    "this expected expansion velocity is just at the limit implied by the velocity widths of the h@xmath0  and [ nii ]  lines .",
    "raising the ambient density by a factor of 2 can lower the expected expansion velocity to 6.5 ^-1 km  s@xmath6 , which is more consistent with the observed limit .",
    "we conclude that the observed bubble dynamics of n44j does not greatly contradict the model predictions .",
    "on the southeast part of n44 , another small ring - like nebula is present : n44 m .",
    "it is the faintest nebula of our sample .",
    "it shows a ring with a radius of @xmath1122  ( or 5.3 pc ) , but its north boundary is not well defined ( see fig .",
    "[ n44jm ] ) .",
    "the sharp southwest boundary suggests the presence of dust clouds .",
    "several bright stars appear in its interior .",
    "n44 m possesses an excitation structure very similar to n44j .",
    "the [ sii]/h@xmath0  ratio of n44 m is comparable to that in n44f , but the [ oiii]/h@xmath0  ratio of n44 m is much lower , ranging from 0.07 to 0.16 in the nebula and rising to 0.4 near the stars .",
    "the integrated [ oiii]/h@xmath0  ratio of n44 m is about 0.18 .    with an observed h@xmath0  flux of 5.3@xmath410@xmath60 erg@xmath32s@xmath6 and the two evaluations of the extinction , the required ionizing flux @xmath16 is 1.52.1@xmath410@xmath61 photonss@xmath6 .",
    "this suggests an o9-b0v type ionizing star @xcite , which is again compatible with the [ oiii]/h@xmath0  ratio @xcite .",
    "if we assume a spherical geometry , we find that the rms density is about @xmath1117 @xmath18 and the estimated mass of the nebula @xmath11275 m@xmath34 .",
    "the echelle spectrum of n44 m shows only one component , centered at 298 ^-1 km  s@xmath6  with an rms variation of 1 ^-1 km  s@xmath6 , and a fwhm of 28@xmath621 ^-1 km  s@xmath6  in the h@xmath0  line and 20@xmath624 ^-1 km  s@xmath6  in the [ nii ]  line ( see figs .  [ specn44 ] and [ prof ] ) .",
    "the turbulent fwhm are then 12 ^-1 km  s@xmath6  for h@xmath0  and 14 ^-1 km  s@xmath6  for [ nii ] . with an observed radius of @xmath1122 , a density of 10 @xmath18 for the ism and a o9.5v ionizing star ( see section 4.1 . )",
    ", the standard bubble model predicts an expansion velocity of @xmath117 ^-1 km  s@xmath6  for n44 m , which appears consistent with the upper limit of the echelle observations .",
    "the kinematic characteristics of n44j and n44 m are very similar , despite the somewhat different morphology .",
    "neither hii  region contains shells expanding at velocities greater than @xmath118 ^-1 km  s@xmath6 . in the future",
    ", additional observations may enable a better comparison of these nebulae with the standard model .",
    "precise photometry and/or stellar spectroscopy would give accurate informations about the stellar content of these nebulae , while nebular spectra with higher resolution should more strongly constrain the kinematics of n44j and n44 m .",
    "thus , improved data is needed to more stringently test the standard model for n44j and n44 m .",
    "massive stars inject a large amount of energy into the ism through their ionizing radiation , fast stellar winds , and sne .",
    "the stellar winds , which dominate the early mechanical feedback , are able to sweep the ambient medium into an expanding shell and create a cavity around the parent stars .",
    "hii  regions ionized by massive stars are therefore thought to evolve from compact hii  regions to ring - like nebulae .",
    "we have studied three candidate wind - blown bubbles in the n44 complex : n44f , n44j , and n44 m .",
    "they all have diameters of @xmath1110  pc .",
    "their ionizing fluxes and [ oiii]/h@xmath0  ratios suggest that their ionizing stars have spectral types of roughly o7v , o9.5v and o9.5v , respectively .",
    "n44f has an expansion velocity of 12 ^-1 km  s@xmath6 , while the other two have expansion velocities @xmath3 8 ^ -1 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the stellar wind luminosity implied by the ionizing stars and the observed bubble dynamics appear consistent with that expected in the standard , adiabatic bubble model within the limits of observational uncertainties .",
    "similar results were found by @xcite for two bubbles around single o star in m33 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the anomalous kinematics seen in superbubbles and wolf - rayet bubbles .",
    "we caution , however , that our observed expansion velocities may not provide the most stringent constraints when comparing with models , because the expected expansion velocities of n44j and n44 m are comparable to or smaller than the convolution of the isothermal sound velocity ( @xmath1110 ^-1 km  s@xmath6 ) and the instrumental fwhm ( 13 ^-1 km  s@xmath6 ) .",
    "deeper , higher - resolution spectroscopic observations of the [ nii ]  or [ oiii ]  lines are needed to pin down the expansion velocity for a more definitive test of models .",
    "we also report the discovery of several dust pillars in n44f , which are similar to those found in the eagle nebula @xcite and 30 doradus @xcite .",
    "these structures are indicative of the evaporation of molecular clouds by the ionizing source .",
    "the examples in n44f are especially well - suited to investigating the process and role of photoevaporation in star formation and shell evolution , because of their location within such a well - defined , wind - blown bubble .",
    "we found that photoevaporation , as evidenced by the pillar structure , may be dynamically important for the shell evolution in n44f , slowing down the expanding shell and inhibiting its growth .",
    "these photoevaporation processes may thus undermine the seeming agreement between the observed bubble dynamics and the simple adiabatic bubble model .",
