    "in the current cold dark matter ( hereafter cdm ) paradigm of structure formation , a key concept in the build - up of structure in the universe is the hierarchical formation of dark matter halos .",
    "galaxies and other luminous objects are assumed to form by cooling and condensation of baryons within these halos ( see * ? ? ? * for an overview ) . in this scenario ,",
    "a detailed understanding of the formation and structure of dark matter halos is of fundamental importance for predicting the properties of luminous objects , such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies .",
    "the formation history of a cdm halo is conveniently represented by its merger tree , which describes how its progenitors merge and accrete during its entire formation history . for a given cosmological model ,",
    "such merger trees can be constructed either from n - body simulations or from monte - carlo realizations based on the extended press - schechter ( ps ) formalism @xcite . in recent years , much effort has been made to characterize and understand the statistical properties of halo formation in a cdm cosmogony .",
    "one particular aspect of the halo formation process is the existence of a subhalo population , which is produced by the accretion and survival of progenitors at various times ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "since galaxies may form at the centers of these progenitors and merge into the final halo along with their hosts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "one of the basic properties of the subhalo population is the mass function of the progenitors of subhalos ( i.e. , the masses of the subhalos at their moment of accretion ) .",
    "following @xcite , we refer to this mass function as the _ un - evolved _ subhalo mass function , to distinguish it from the _ evolved _ subhalo mass function that refers to the present day masses of dark matter subhalos ( see  [ sec_model ] for details ) .",

    "before presenting our model , let us first describe briefly the the @xmath0-body simulations to be used to test the model .",
    "we use two different @xmath0-body simulations that assume the same cosmology but use different box sizes ( mass resolutions ) .",
    "both simulations were carried out using the massively parallel gadget2 code @xcite .",

    "a total of 100 outputs in equal @xmath19 interval were made , starting from @xmath20 ( for @xmath5 box ) and @xmath21 ( for @xmath4 box ) to @xmath7 .",
    "dark matter halos were identified from the simulations at each output using the standard friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm @xcite with a linking length of @xmath22 times the mean interparticle separation . here",
    "we keep all halos with at least 20 particles .",
    "based on halos at different outputs , halo merger trees were constructed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a halo in an earlier output is considered to be a progenitor of the present halo if more than half of its particles are found in the present halo .",
    "the main branch of a merger tree is defined to consist of all the progenitors one goes through as one climbs from the bottom to the top , choosing always the most massive branch at every branching point .",
    "these progenitors are referred to as the main - branch progenitors , and the time dependence of the main branch mass is referred to as the assembly history . in our analysis based on the @xmath5 box simulation , we randomly choose about 200 trees , from the total merger tree catalogue , to sample each of the two massive bins at @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and about 2000 trees to sample each of the low - mass bins at @xmath25 and @xmath26 , with bin widths @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "our tests later are mainly based on the @xmath5 box simulation . however , in many cases we also use halo merger trees obtained from the @xmath4 box simulation to achieve better mass resolution .",
    "specifically , about 7 , 36 , 400 and 2000 trees are selected from this simulation to sample the merger histories for halos with @xmath23 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , with bin widths @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "now we come back to our modeling of the accretion of subhalos .",
    "we want to obtain the distribution of dark matter subhalos with respect to their mass at accretion , @xmath32 , and their accretion redshift , @xmath33 , in a host halo of mass @xmath34 at redshift @xmath35 .",
    "for convenience we use @xmath36 to label the masses , @xmath32 and @xmath34 , and @xmath37 to label the redshifts @xmath33 and @xmath35 . here",
    "@xmath38 is the variance of the linear density field at @xmath7 on mass scale @xmath39 , and @xmath40 [ with @xmath41 the linear grow factor normalized to unity at @xmath7 ] is the critical density of spherical collapse at redshift @xmath43 .",
    "we write the mean number of subhalos of mass @xmath32 accreted at redshift @xmath33 in a host halo @xmath44 as @xmath45    the mean mass , @xmath46 , of the main branch halos for all @xmath47 - halos is in general a monotonically decreasing function of redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we write @xmath48 . hence , for given @xmath44 we can use @xmath49 as a time - variable . denote by @xmath50 the mean fraction of the total mass accreted in the ` time - interval ' @xmath51 $ ] that is in halos of mass @xmath32 .",
    "we can write @xmath52 it then follows that @xmath53 note that @xmath54 is determined by the perturbation power spectrum , @xmath55 by the linear growth factor , and @xmath56 by the mean halo assembly history .",
    "we can integrate @xmath57 over the mean mass assembly history to obtain the so - called un - evolved subhalo mass function : @xmath58 this function describes the distribution of the masses at accretion of all subhalos accreted into the main - branch of the merger history of the @xmath47 host halo .",
    "thus for a given cosmology , one can obtain both @xmath59 and the un - evolved subhalo mass function once models for @xmath60 and for the mean halo assembly history are adopted . in general @xmath61",
    "can be obtained using halo merger trees constructed either from numerical simulations or from analytical models , such as the extended ps formalism . here",
    "we develop a simple analytical model based on the statistical properties of halo assembly histories , instead of on the full merger trees .",
    "consider a halo whose main - branch mass is @xmath62 at @xmath33 .",
    "since we are modeling the accretion of subhalos into the main branch of its merger tree , we must have that @xmath63 with reflects the mass of the progenitor halo which , after accretion into the main - branch , increases the main - branch mass to @xmath62 ] @xmath65 thus , a simple model for the mass fraction in @xmath66-progenitors to be accreted at @xmath33 may be written as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the mass fraction in progenitor halos of mass @xmath32 to be accreted at redshift @xmath33 .",
    "the normalization factor , @xmath69 is the total mass fraction of all progenitors that can be accreted into the main branch .",
    "now suppose that the distribution of @xmath62 at @xmath33 is given by @xmath70 then @xmath71                in order to proceed we need to make one important addition .",
    "the @xcite model only gives the median assembly history .",
    "however , a complete model for the un - evolved subhalo distribution with respect to the mass at accretion and the redshift of accretion requires the full distribution function @xmath100 .",
    "it is easy to understand that the dispersion in @xmath62 plays an important role . since by definition the masses of subhalos are all smaller than that of the main progenitor , using the mean assembly history",
    "would imply that at any given time no accreted subhalo can have a mass larger than the mean mass on the main branch . clearly , when allowing for dispersion in the main - branch masses , this constraint is no longer present .",
    "the different panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter ] show the distributions of the main - branch halo masses at different redshifts obtained from simulations ( histograms ) .",
    "results are shown for halos with redshift zero masses @xmath101 ( panels in the upper two rows ) and @xmath29 ( panels in the lower two rows ) , respectively .",
    "all the distributions are reasonably well described by a log - normal distribution , with median given by the @xcite model , and with a dispersion ( in 10-based logarithm ) given by @xmath102 as shown by the solid curves in the figure .",
    "the lack of low - mass main - branch progenitors in the simulation apparent in the bottom right two panels is simply due to the mass limit in the @xmath0-body simulation . for comparison , the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : assembly ] show the @xmath103 range given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma1 ] ) , together with the median given by the @xcite model ( solid curves ) .",
    "an important advantage of the log - normal form for the distribution @xmath100 is that it is straightforward to compute the _ average _ accretion rate @xmath104 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : n_a_1 ] ] ) .",
    "after all , for a log - normal distribution the average @xmath105 is related to the median @xmath106 according to @xmath107 .",
    "thus , assuming a log - normal distribution , we can simply use the @xcite model for the _ median _ assembly history to obtain the _",
    "mean _ accretion rate .",
    "[ fig : dm_dlogz ] shows the mass accretion rate @xmath108 for halos with different final masses .",
    "the dashed curve in each panel is the prediction of the @xcite model of the median together with the log - normal distribution described above .    in the simulations , especially for small halos at low redshifts ,",
    "there are time - steps over which the accretion rate is negative .",
    "this can come about due to , for instance , tidal stripping by neighboring structures , the loss of unbound subhalos or unbound particles , the fragmentation of halos , and the fof - bridging problem .",
    "the @xcite model has taken such effects explicitly into account via a correction factor in equation ( [ eq : p_zhao ] ) .",
    "in general , however , it is possible to have two different definitions of the un - evolved subhalo population , one based on all subhalos that have entered the main branch at some point ( but are not necessarily bound to or located within the final halo ) , and the other based on those that have more than half of their particles ending up in the final halo . in this paper",
    "we adopt the first definition in which the accretion rate is determined by all subhalos that have been accreted onto the main branch at some point in time , regardless of whether they have left the main branch again or not .",
    "the open circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : dm_dlogz ] show the simulation results based on this definition .",
    "as one can see , the mean mass accretion rates predicted by the @xcite model match well the simulation results over a large range of redshift ; the mismatch seen at high-@xmath43 for low - mass halos is simply an artefact due to the limited numerical resolution of the simulation .",
    "the only significant discrepancy occurs for low - mass halos at low redshift where the predicted rate is lower than the simulated rate .",
    "this discrepancy is mainly due to the fact that the @xcite model tries to account for the affects of tidal stripping and the presence of unbound subhalos . for our definition of the un - evolved subhalo population ,",

    "we have tested , though , that using the second definition instead yields results that are very similar , except when it concerns the subhalos accreted at low redshifts in low - mass host halos .",
    "in this section we use the @xmath0-body simulations described in section 2 to test our models for the distribution of subhalos with respect to their accretion redshift and their mass at accretion .      the first quantity we consider is the conditional mass function of subhalos in host halos of different masses ( eq . [ [ eq : cmfmean ] ] ) . from the halo merger trees constructed from the simulations , we measure the mass distribution of accreted subhalos within equal @xmath111-bins centered at @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , respectively . the results are shown in fig .",

    "each column shows results for host halos with a given mass , while each row shows the results at a given redshift .",
    "note that , because of mass resolution and because of tidal effects , a fraction of the subhalos containing @xmath116 particles , especially those near massive halos , are not gravitationally bound .",
    "this is the reason for the artificial upturn in the conditional mass function seen in the low - resolution simulation results at low redshift . in the literature",
    "this problem has been treated either by using only halos that contain large enough number of particles or by getting rid of unbound particles from halos .",
    "for instance , the subfind halo finder developed by @xcite tries to separate bound and unbound structures in fof halos . in @xcite ,",
    "unbound particles are removed iteratively from each halo until the total energy of the halo becomes negative . in order to quantify the magnitude of this effect",
    ", we have also constructed halo merger trees using a method similar to @xcite to calculate the number of bound particles per ( sub)-halo .",
    "halos with less than 20 bound particles are discarded from our sample . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_dist ] , we show the results obtained from the @xmath4 simulation box in which we removed the halos with bound particles less than 20 ( using the method described above ) , together with the results from the @xmath5 simulation box without such treatment .",
    "the dotted , vertical lines correspond to halos with 100 particles in each of the two simulations , and are show for comparison . as one can see , the treatment of the unbound halos is able to remove the spurious upturn at the low - mass end .",
    "but for sure and to be conservative , the results presented below are all for subhalos containing at least 100 particles .    the long dashed lines in fig .  [",

    "[ fig : mass_dist ] , for massive host halos this model significantly over - predicts the number of accreted low - mass subhalos and under - predicts that of accreted massive subhalos .",

    "finally , let us look at our model iii , the results of which are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : mass_dist ] as solid curves .",
    "clearly , model iii matches the simulation results much better than either model i or ii , especially for massive hosts .",
    "note that all three models shown have adopted the correction of eq .",
    "( [ eq : correction ] ) .",
    "if we use model iii without this correction , the model underpredicts the abundance of subhalos ( as defined using the first definition described in ",
    "[ sec : assembly ] ) , especially for low - mass host halos at low redshifts . for completeness , we have also tested model iii without the dispersion in halo assembly histories . as expected ,",
    "not taking this dispersion into account yields conditional subhalo mass functions in poor agreement with the simulation , especially at higher redshifts .",
    "hence , we caution that it is important to properly account for the dispersion in halo assembly histories .      with the conditional mass functions described above ,",
    "it is straightforward to calculate the accretion rate of subhalos as a function of host halo mass and redshift .",

    "although having better statistics , has insufficient mass resolution to properly resolve the merger statistics of low mass halos at higher redshifts ( as is clearly evident from the lower two panels ) .",
    "clearly , the results of model iii are in very good agreement with the simulation results , and fair much better than either model i or model ii . in",

    "since more massive halos assemble later ( see fig.[fig : assembly ] ) , their last major mergers , on average , occur at lower redshifts , as shown clearly in the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : majorn ] ( see similar findings in @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , the characteristic mass of those last major mergers , in units of the host halo mass , is virtually independent of the host halo mass .",

    "for example , it is interesting to notice that the average time interval between major mergers is roughly the same as the time during which the main branch mass increases by a constant factor , about @xmath123 , quite independent of the host halo mass .    in a recent paper based on the millennium simulations ,",
    "@xcite have come up with a fitting formula which describes the subhalo accretion rates obtained from the simulations .",

    "in this paper we have developed an analytical model for the mass function of cdm subhalos at their time of accretion and for the distribution of their accretion times .",
    "this model can be used to predict the un - evolved subhalo mass function , the mass function of subhalos accreted at a given time , the accretion - time distribution of subhalos of a given initial mass , and the frequency of major mergers as a function of time .",
    "we have tested our model against results obtained from high - resolution @xmath0-body simulations , and found that the model predictions match the simulation results extremely well . in this section ,",
    "we first discuss the universality of our model based on the ingredients used in the construction of the model .",
    "we then briefly describe two possible applications of our model .",
    "the first ingredient of our model is the adopted form for @xmath148 . as described in section  [ sec : model_f ] , all of our three models , i , ii and iii , are based on the extended ps theory , which has been shown to work reasonably well for various hierarchical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the modifications made in models ii and iii have not been tested for other cosmological models . however , the fact that these models work well for the @xmath18cdm model over a large redshift range , during which the cosmological parameters change by fairly large amounts , suggests that the modifications should also work for other cosmological models with similar power spectra .",
    "unfortunately , the effective power indices covered by the @xmath18cdm spectrum are limited , and it is presently unclear whether the modifications will work equally well for models with vastly different power spectra",
    ". it will be interesting to test the validity of our model using scale - free models that cover a large range in spectral indices .",
    "the second ingredient of our model is the form of @xmath70 described in section [ sec : assembly ] . as tested extensively in @xcite , their model for the median accretion history is universal and works not only for realistic cdm models but also for scale - free models with different spectral indices .",
    "since our tests cover a range of redshifts over which the cosmological parameters change by a large amount , we expect the log - normal form of @xmath70 , and the mass dependence of its dispersion ( eq .  [ [ eq : sigma1 ] ] ) , to also apply to other models that have a power - spectrum that is not too different from that of the @xmath18cdm cosmology considered here . here",
    "again , it will be interesting to test the validity of our model for other power spectra using scale - free models",
    ".    similar arguments also apply to the correction given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : correction ] ) .",
    "this ` correction ' is empirically obtained by @xcite from various cdm and scale - free models . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : assembly ] , using the model with or without this ` correction ' corresponds to two different definitions of the un - evolved subhalo population , and only has a non - negligible impact when it comes to subhalos accreted at low redshifts in low - mass host halos .    to summarize , we believe that our model holds for any variant of the @xmath18cdm model .",
    "in particular , it should work accurately for any cosmological model whose parameters are in agreement with current observational constraints from the cosmic microwave background , supernovae ia , and galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "our model has a number of applications .",
    "here we focus on two of them : ( i ) the evolution of subhalos as they orbit within their hosts , and ( ii ) the construction of a self - consistent model to link galaxies and dark matter halos across cosmic time .",
    "the model described here applies to subhalos at accretion , i.e. the un - evolved population of subhalos .",
    "however , as a small halo merges with and orbits in a larger halo , it is subjected to tidal forces from the host , causing it to lose mass , and to dynamical friction , which causes it to lose energy and angular momentum to the dark matter particles of the host .",
    "thus , dynamical evolution after accretion can change the properties of the subhalo population .",
    "a great deal of work has been done to understand the properties of the ` evolved ' subhalo population , using either numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or merger trees constructed from the extended ps formalism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "after accretion , whether a subhalo can survive as a self - bound entity depends on its mass ( relative to that of its host ) , its density profile ( which is related to its accretion redshift ) , and its orbit .",
    "the model presented here provides information about the first two parts .",
    "thus , combined with information about the initial orbits of accreted subhalos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and about how dynamical friction and tidal stripping operate on subhalos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our model can be used to construct models for the evolved subhalo population , such as their mass function , their distribution in host halos , and their correlation with host halo properties .",
    "we will come back to such modeling in a future paper .",
    "the last decade has seen much effort in using halo occupation statistics to describe the galaxy - dark matter connection in an attempt to understand the galaxy luminosity function , galaxy clustering , galaxy - galaxy lensing , and the kinematics of satellite galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several of these studies have tried to make a direct link between the halo occupation statistics of galaxies and of dark matter subhalos , using abundance matching techniques to link satellite galaxies to subhalos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these investigations typically rely on the un - evolved subhalo mass function , but do not account for the possibility that different subhalos are accreted at different times and that the halo mass - galaxy mass relation may be redshift - dependent . in order to construct a self - consistent model based on abundance matching",
    ", one needs not only the ( un - evolved ) subhalo mass function , but also the distribution of accretion times .",
    "this is exactly what our model can provide . in a forthcoming paper @xcite",
    ", we will construct such a self - consistent model to characterize how the galaxy - dark matter connection evolves over time .",
