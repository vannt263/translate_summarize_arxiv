    "a future high - energy electron - positron collider will allow a very precise measurement of the top - antitop production cross section near threshold . from the threshold scan several standard model parameters , like top - quark mass , width , and yukawa coupling ,",

    "contrary to direct reconstructions at hadron colliders , there is no ambiguity in relating the result to a precisely defined mass parameter . to achieve this level of accuracy requires precise theoretical predictions for the threshold cross section .",
    "the challenge is that conventional perturbation expansions in the strong coupling @xmath7 fail for threshold production , since it involves multiple scales . in terms of the mass @xmath8 and velocity @xmath9 of the top - quark",
    "these are the hard scale @xmath8 , the soft scale @xmath10 , and the ultrasoft scale @xmath11 . at the ultrasoft scale ,",
    "the colour - coulomb force is non - perturbatively strong . in terms of feynman diagrams",
    ", this implies that when the velocity is of order of the strong coupling , coulomb singularities of the form @xmath12 have to be summed to all orders .",
    "this can be achieved by successively integrating out the hard and soft scale leading to the non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd )  @xcite and potential nrqcd ( pnrqcd )  @xcite effective field theories , respectively . within this framework , described in detail for top - quark pair production near threshold in @xcite , the dominant contribution from the s - wave correlation function has been computed at next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnnlo )  @xcite .",
    "the axial - vector coupling of the top quark to the @xmath13 boson gives rise to a p - wave contribution to the top - pair production cross section . in this work",
    "we compute the corresponding p - wave pnrqcd correlation function .",
    "being suppressed by @xmath14 relative to the s - wave it contributes only starting from nnlo .",
    "the complete nnnlo calculation of the threshold correction therefore requires a nlo calculation of the p - wave correlation function , which we perform here in dimensional regularization .",
    "some results for the p - wave green function were already obtained in  @xcite , but none of these computations were performed in dimensional regularization .",
    "dimensional regularization is , however , required for the following reason : the imaginary part of the p - wave green function , which is relevant for the cross section , is divergent already at leading order in the non - relativistic expansion , if the finite width of the top quark is included .",
    "this divergence and the resulting scheme dependence cancel only when non - resonant corrections to the process @xmath15 are added .",
    "the separation of resonant and non - resonant contributions can be performed consistently in unstable - particle effective field theory  @xcite , in which the non - resonant terms appear as a hard region .",
    "the corresponding diagrams are computed as usual in dimensional regularization as has already been done in  @xcite .",
    "consistency then requires that the non - relativistic , resonant part is also computed in dimensional regularization .",
    "we emphasize that to determine the top - quark mass precisely it is necessary to compute the process @xmath15 including non - resonant terms , since the top mass is ultimately determined from the rise of the cross section near threshold , where non - resonant effects are important  @xcite .",
