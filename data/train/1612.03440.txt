    "this _ second - order emissivity _ appears in addition to the usual source term @xmath1 corresponding to the emission of completely redistributed radiation via spontaneous de - excitation of the upper state .    in other words , to second order of perturbation , the interaction of an atomic system with an incoming beam of photons acquires an additional _ scattering channel _ , beside the one corresponding to the pure absorption of a photon with the consequent excitation of the target atom ( i.e. , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the incoming photon , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 two atomic states satisfying the energy conservation relation @xmath8 ) . in the new scattering channel available to perturbative second order ,",
    "the incident photon is instead immediately re - emitted after a _ virtual _ excitation of the atom , possibly leaving the atom in a different energy ( and polarization ) state from the original one ( i.e. , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 ; the condition @xmath11 evidently corresponds to rayleigh scattering , whereas @xmath12 to raman scattering ) .",

    "-type multi - term atom . in order to correctly describe the polarization properties of the outgoing light in the @xmath13 transition",
    ", all lower terms @xmath14 that are radiatively or collisionally connected to the upper term @xmath15 , including the final term @xmath16 , must be taken into account .",
    "[ fig : model ] ]    on the other hand , the parallel extension to second - order atom - photon processes of the se problem in the formalism of @xcite suggests that a partial cancellation of the radiative rate for one - photon absorption occurs in the presence of coherent scattering , with a consequent reduction of the population of the excited state with respect to the case of one - photon processes . in the limit of _",
    "infinitely sharp lower levels _ , this population cancellation is found to be total , in agreement with the simple physical argument that no upper state population can be produced when the lower state has an infinite lifetime .",
    "one of the expected results of a self - consistent solution of the combined se+rt problem to perturbative second order is that the radiative energy is conserved even when both emissivity terms @xmath1 and @xmath2 are taken into account .",
    "recently , the expression for the rt equation including coherent scattering has been applied to modeling various examples of the partial redistribution of polarized radiation in spectral lines from @xmath3-type transitions formed in a collisionless plasma @xcite .",
    "since the formal derivation of the corresponding set of se equations has not yet been completed , the solution of the first - order se problem was adopted in that work .",
    "this creates no formal issues of energy conservation , in the limit of infinitely sharp lower levels assumed by the model , since no population of the upper state from true absorption of the incoming photons is expected in that case .",
    "hence , one can assume that the scattering of radiation is completely described by @xmath2 , and the contribution of @xmath1 to the rt equation can be omitted altogether .",
    "of course , the condition of infinite lifetime of the lower state in deriving the first - order se solution can only be approximated numerically by using an extremely diluted radiation field to illuminate the scatterer @xcite .",
    "height dependence of the @xmath17 ratio for the two - term model atom in the collisional fal - c atmosphere . ]    on the other hand , in the application of numerical rt including prd effects to realistic models of optically thick atmospheres , the fraction of the upper state population @xmath18 that enters the first - order emissivity can be significant ( typically of the order of 1% at the bottom of the atmosphere ; see figure  [ fig : rho - trend ] ) .",
    "this is even more critical in the presence of collisions , as it is safe to assume that collisional excitation _",
    "always _ leads to the complete redistribution of the energy of the scattered radiation .",
    "hence , in the absence of a formal self - consistent solution of the combined se+rt problem to perturbative second order , the question naturally arises of how to handle _ phenomenologically _ the contribution of spontaneous de - excitation via @xmath1 alongside with the coherent - scattering emissivity @xmath2 , without impacting energy conservation .",
    "a possible way of dealing with this type of issues is to introduce appropriate weights between the contributions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the rt equation for the stokes vector @xmath19 of the propagating radiation field , i.e.  ( cf .",
    "* ) , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the @xmath22 absorption matrix for the outgoing photon of frequency @xmath23 and propagation direction @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the linear coordinate along the propagation path , and finally @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the ( real ) weights for the fully incoherent ( i.e. , completely redistributed ) and partially coherent scattering contributions , respectively . because these weights take the form of probability ratios for the various processes that determine the excitation state of the atom , they are commonly called _ branching ratios_.",
    "the choice of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 weights will generally depend on the properties of the physical system at hand .",
    "in particular , they will take different forms depending on whether the system includes or not collisions .",
    "in this work we do not address the problem of establishing physically consistent branching ratios for the purely radiative case , and simply adopt @xmath28 and @xmath29 in such case ( cf .",
    "this choice is supported by the underlying assumption of weak incident radiation , which in turn is consistent with the hypothesis of infinite radiative lifetime for the lower state , and with the approximation of neglecting stimulated effects .",
    "we must note that this choice does not create any issues when the ratio @xmath17 is important , since in practical cases this always happens when the system is close to local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , e.g. , at the bottom of the atmosphere ( see figure  [ fig : rho - trend ] ) .",
    "in such case , the incident radiation field can be assumed to be spectrally flat over a very large interval of the atomic transition s frequency , and so @xmath30 , when the first - order density matrix solution is employed .",
    "thus our choice of branching ratios for the purely radiative case correctly reproduces the expected crd regime of the scattered radiation at lte .",

    "we develop our approach to the derivation of branching ratios between the crd and prd contributions to the rt equation ( [ eq : rt ] ) for the polarized multi - term atom starting first from the case of an unpolarized two - level atom .",
    "this is a natural choice that allows us to directly interpret the branching ratios as event probabilities for the various radiative and collisional processes that can be realized within the interacting system .",
    "we use a simple diagrammatic representation of the interacting system in order to describe the interplay of radiative and collisional ( both inelastic and elastic ) processes .",
    "after such detailed albeit heuristic analysis , at the end we are able to justify very naturally a straightforward extension of our results to the case of the polarized multi - term atom .",
    "we consider the case of a two - level atom with lower level @xmath31 and upper level @xmath15 , in the presence of both radiative and collisional processes .",
    "we have ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath32 where @xmath18 and @xmath33 are the relative populations of the upper and lower states , respectively , which are subject to the normalization of the trace of the atomic density matrix , so that @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 is some appropriate average of the ambient radiation intensity at the frequency of the atomic transition ( see , e.g. , equation  ( [ eq : jdefinition ] ) ) , whereas @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the usual einstein radiative coefficients for the transition @xmath38 , and @xmath39 the corresponding collisional rate .",
    "we note that the approximate equality in equation  ( [ eq : rho_coll ] ) becomes exact in the case of an unpolarized lower state ( see @xcite ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : rho_coll ] ) suggests that a fraction @xmath40 of the upper state population is contributed by collisional excitation . in that case",
    ", there is also a purely collisional contribution to the emitted radiation given by @xmath41 .",
    "such process is represented schematically by the first diagram of figure  [ fig : diagrams ] . in the same figure ,",
    "diagram ( ii ) represents the coherent scattering of radiation , which is accounted for by the second - order emissivity @xmath2 , and does not contribute to the population of the upper state , which is only virtually excited .",
    "however , in the presence of collisions , the coherence of the scattering process to perturbative second order may be destroyed by the intervention of a colliding particle ( diagrams ( iii ) and ( iv ) ) .",
    "this mechanism may either trigger the immediate collisional de - excitation of the upper state in the case of an inelastic encounter with rate @xmath42 ( final state @xmath31 ; diagram ( iii ) ) , or simply redistribute the internal energy of the upper state ( with _ radiatively _ induced population @xmath43 ; see equations ( [ eq : rho_coll ] ) and ( [ eq : w_c ] ) ) in the case of an elastic encounter with rate @xmath44 ( final state @xmath15 ; diagram ( iv ) ) . in the first case",
    ", there is no radiative contribution to equation  ( [ eq : rt ] ) , whereas in the second case the upper state eventually decays with the emission of completely redistributed radiation ( i.e. , associated again with @xmath1 ) .",
    "the above analysis should be generalized to properly take into account the effects of collisions on atomic polarization .",
    "as this requires the introduction of individual multipolar collisional rates @xmath45 in the se problem , one could think of introducing accordingly specific weights @xmath46 for the individual multipolar density matrix components @xmath47 in @xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand , this is quite inconvenient ( as well as ambiguous ) , and an alternative approach will be presented at the very end , after we discuss the results of our heuristic diagrammatic analysis in the light of other treatments of this problem found in the literature . for the current discussion",
    ", we are assuming that the partition coefficient @xmath48 applies identically to all components of the atomic density matrix , and therefore it is fully appropriate only in the case of the unpolarized atom .",
    "it is important to observe that when the inelastic collision lifetime of the upper state is included in the computation of the damping parameter of the line profile , then @xmath2 already contains the proper branching ratio to account for the possibility of collisional de - excitation following the radiative excitation of the upper state ( figure  [ fig : diagrams].(iii ) ) . in order to see this",
    ", one must recall that the formal derivation of the second - order emissivity @xcite leads to the following expression for the atomic - frame redistribution function @xmath49 in terms of the generalized line profiles @xmath50 that appear in @xmath2 ( cf .",
    "* equation  ( 6 ) ) , @xmath51 where we indicated with @xmath52 the ( complex ) frequency of the atomic level @xmath6 , which is comprised of the true energy @xmath53 of the level and its statistical width @xmath54 . generally , @xmath54 represents the inverse of the _ total _ lifetime of the quantum state @xmath6 , from which the damping parameter for the corresponding energy level is calculated .",
    "therefore , in the presence of a non - zero probability for collisional de - excitation , the quantity @xmath55 , which appears at the denominator in the expression of @xmath2 , is augmented by the corresponding collisional rate .",
    "hence , the probability for a coherent scattering event to occur is accordingly reduced , and it is immediately verified that the reduction factor is @xmath56 .",
    "we now recall that @xmath30 in the absence of collisions and in the limit of spectrally flat illumination ( cf .",
    "* equations  ( 48 ) and ( 49 ) ) , showing that @xmath2 in that case contains exactly @xmath57 .",
    "because in the presence of collisions the denominator in @xmath2 is augmented by @xmath42 , from equations  ( [ eq : rho_coll ] ) and ( [ eq : w_c ] ) and the previous discussion we conclude that , also in this case , in the limit of spectrally flat illumination , @xmath2 contains exactly @xmath58 .",
    "this demonstrates that the possibility that the virtually excited upper state might decay via collisional de - excitation , reducing the contribution of coherent scattering to the rt equation ( [ eq : rt ] ) , is already accounted for in the expression of @xmath2 , and that the reduction factor is exactly given by @xmath59 .",
    "hence , in the presence of radiative and _ inelastic _ collisional processes , @xmath2 already provides the correct contribution of coherent scattering to the emitted radiation without the need for an additional multiplicative weighting factor . the rt equation ( [ eq : rt ] )",
    "thus becomes ( @xmath60 , @xmath29 ) , @xmath61 where we also recalled equation  ( [ eq : w_c ] ) .",
    "we note that , in the limit of spectrally flat illumination , the above equation properly converges to the equation for the polarized rt in the crd regime , since @xmath62 in that case .    in the additional presence of _",
    "elastic _ collisions , the same analysis as before applies , but now a fully redistributed radiation component is contributed also by @xmath63 , according to our diagrammatic analysis presented above ( figure  [ fig : diagrams].(iv ) ) .",
    "since the main effect of elastic collisions on the line shape comes from the perturbation of the energy of the atomic levels , which statistically can be approximated with a lorentzian distribution , it is sensible to add the elastic collision rate to the damping parameters in the redistribution function .",
    "similarly , the effect of an elastic collision on an atomic level can be interpreted as a process where the atomic state before the collision is destroyed and immediately recreated into a new ( iso - energetic ) perturbed state , with a characteristic inverse lifetime @xmath64 for the process .",
    "accordingly , the energy of the atomic level acquires an additional imaginary contribution due to elastic collisions , i.e. , @xmath65 , and the probability for the coherent scattering of the incident radiation is once again reduced by the corresponding modification of the denominator @xmath55 in the expression of @xmath2 . because the inclusion of elastic collisions to the first - order se problem does not affect the population balance between the upper and lower states , the proposed modification of @xmath2 , in the limit of spectrally flat illumination , is formally equivalent to the substitution ( @xmath66 , for the population ) @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the probability that the excited atom undergoes an elastic encounter with a colliding particle .",
    "this is exactly what we expect from our diagrammatic analysis ( see figure  [ fig : diagrams].(iv ) ) .",
    "therefore , even in the additional presence of elastic collisions , when the corresponding rate is added to the lifetime @xmath69 of the upper level , @xmath2 describes the proper contribution of coherent scattering to the emitted radiation without the need of an ad - hoc multiplicative branching ratio .    in turn , according to our diagrammatic analysis , the probability ( [ eq : gamma ] ) that an elastic collision occurs after the atom has been radiatively excited must bring a new contribution of fully redistributed radiation to the rt equation ( [ eq : rt.in - coll ] ) , which is proportional to @xmath70 therefore , _ in the general presence of radiative and collisional processes , both inelastic and elastic _ , the rt equation for partially coherent scattering by an unpolarized two - level atom becomes , @xmath71\\ ,          \\bm{\\varepsilon}{^{\\mbox{\\tiny{(1)}}}}(\\omega_{k'},\\bm{\\hat k } ' )      + \\bm{\\varepsilon}{^{\\mbox{\\tiny{(2)}}}}(\\omega_{k'},\\bm{\\hat k}')\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "so far we have concerned ourselves with establishing the choice of branching ratios that allows us to apply the formalism of @xcite to the polarized line formation in two - level atoms . @xcite",
    "have shown that such formalism naturally extends to the treatment of the general multi - level atom of the @xmath3-type ( see figure  [ fig : model ] ) , and so we now want to extend the development of the previous section to such more general model atom . in the spirit of the former development , we do this by considering first the extension to the unpolarized multi - level atom of the @xmath3-type .",
    "we therefore consider an atom with an upper level @xmath15 connected to a set of lower levels @xmath72 , which are assumed to be isolated from each other , both radiatively and collisionally ( see figure  [ fig : model ] ) .",
    "then , the first - order solution for the population of the upper state is given by ( cf .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : rho_coll ] ) ) @xmath73 ( once again , we note that the above relation is exact in the case of an atom with unpolarized lower states . )",
    "we can therefore write @xmath74 for any choice of the weights @xmath75 such that @xmath76 .",
    "the above equation demonstrates that it is still possible to operate a separation between the radiative and collisional contributions to @xmath18 even for the more general model of the @xmath3-type multi - level atom .",
    "this allows us to define @xmath77 like before ( cf .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : w_c ] ) ) , and to extend the use of equation  ( [ eq : rt.coll ] ) to such a model , after performing the formal substitutions @xmath78 in equation  ( [ eq : gamma ] ) .",
    "using equations  ( [ eq : rhou_one ] ) and ( [ eq : rhou_mt ] ) , we thus arrive at the following generalization of equation  ( [ eq : w_c ] ) , @xmath79 if we limit ourselves to considering the first - order se+rt problem , the weights @xmath75 can be _ arbitrarily _ chosen , in so far that they satisfy the normalization condition @xmath80 .",
    "in contrast , in the application of the branching - ratio formalism to the treatment of partially coherent scattering , the choice of these weights is subject to additional physical constraints , because the second - order emissivity already accounts for the proper branching among all possible transitions @xmath81 .",
    "thus , in order to determine the proper expression for the weights @xmath75 , we simply observe that the choice @xmath82}\\ ] ] ensures that the expression for @xmath63 in equation  ( [ eq : rhou_mt ] ) becomes formally equivalent to the one that is explicitly contained in @xmath2 , when the multi - level atom is illuminated by a spectrally flat radiation ( see the discussion leading to equation  ( [ eq : rt.in - coll ] ) ) .",
    "we therefore propose equation  ( [ eq : alpha_i ] ) as the proper definition of the weights @xmath75 to be used in the generalized expression ( [ eq : w_c.mt ] ) for @xmath48 .",
    "the above results were completely derived within the framework of a recent theory of partially coherent scattering from multi - term atoms in a collisionless plasma developed by @xcite ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore important to show how those results compare with existing work on the modeling of the partial redistribution of _ unpolarized _ radiation in multi - level atoms _ and _ in the presence of collisions .    for our comparison , we rely on the work of @xcite , which has become a standard reference for the numerical modeling of multi - level systems including prd effects .",

    "the guiding principle throughout is the fact that the second - order emissivity term @xmath2 , which describes the coherent ( in the broader sense of `` memory preserving '' ) scattering of radiation , must converge to the usual term of spontaneous emission in the limit of spectrally structureless illumination _ and _ in the absence of collisions .    for the sake of simplicity , we formulated and solved first the problem of the unpolarized two - level atom , to finally arrive at the generalization of the results to the case of the polarized multi - term atom of the @xmath3-type . for the intermediate case of the unpolarized multi - level atom , our results",
    "are found to agree with previous works on the subject ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one notable result of this study is that the expression of the @xmath2 emissivity term already accounts for the proper branching among the various radiative and collisional processes that determine the prd contribution to the scattered radiation .",
    "hence , this emissivity term always enters the rt equation without the need for a multiplicative weighting factor ( cf .  equation  ( [ eq : rt.gen ] ) ) . only the crd contribution to the rt equation",
    "must be modified in order not to violate energy conservation ( cf .  equation  ( [ eq : alt.eps1 ] ) ) .    the final expression ( [ eq : rt.gen ] ) of the rt equation for polarized scattering in a multi - term atom of the @xmath3-type",
    "was recently used to model the formation of the h ",
    "k doublet in a magnetized atmosphere , taking into account both inelastic and elastic collisions , but neglecting stimulated emission @xcite ."
