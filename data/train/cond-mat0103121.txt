    "the formal analogies between phase transitions in one - dimensional systems , decoherence in the spin - boson hamiltonian ( sbh ) , and screening in kondo systems have been important in sorting out the subtle behavior of dissipative quantum systems . in this paper",
    "we undertake an analytic and numerical study of the mermin model , a model closely related to the spin - boson model , but possessing a monochromatic environmental spin bath .",
    "the spin - boson model is a universal model for a two level system interacting weakly with an environmental bath , which has a continuous spectrum @xcite . although both monochromatic and polychromatic baths bring about a localization transition in the two level system , we point out , in this paper , an important difference between the dynamics of the two level system interacting weakly with these two kinds of baths .",
    "if the dynamics of the two level system is characterized by a ( pseudo ) spin susceptibility , increasing the coupling to the environment broadens the resonance and shifts the resonant frequency somewhat .",
    "when the environment has a continuous and ohmic spectrum ( the sbh ) , the system spin first loses all coherent behavior at some intermediate coupling strength .",
    "the dynamics of the two level system becomes overdamped at this point , but the localization transition does _ not _ occur until a stronger coupling is reached .",
    "the critical coupling at which the two level system is ultimately localized may be identified with an `` orthogonality catastrophe . '' thus , before the environmental overlap effects become catastrophic , they are _ finite _ and lead to a continuous softening of the system energy scale , as well as a complete inelastic broadening to an incoherent state ( the so called `` toulouse point '' ) .    on the other hand , when the spectrum of the environment is monochromatic ( the mermin model ) , the resulting dynamics are different . as the coupling to the environment increases , the only effect is to broaden the coherent resonance . at a critical coupling , a redistribution of spectral weight",
    "is initiated and spectral weight flows from the coherent resonance to a localized feature at zero frequency . for coupling strengths beyond this value , spectral weight is increasingly transferred from the resonant peak to the localized feature .",
    "thus , unlike the sbh , the mermin model does not show any overdamped feature before the localization transition sets in .",
    "when localization does set in ( at the critical point ) , _ the coherent peak continues to exist , albeit with reduced spectral weight_. this is our main result .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ an_res ] ,",
    "we introduce the mermin model and study the dynamics of the model using an analytical technique .",
    "this technique ( based on liouvillian operator methods ) has been applied successfully in the past , to a variety of dissipative models , including the sbh . in section [ num_res ] ,",
    "we study the model numerically , and show that the model exhibits a localization transition at a critical value of the coupling strength .",
    "the final section contains some concluding remarks , summarizing our results and suggesting future directions of study .",
    "in this section , we introduce the mermin model and study the dynamics of the model analytically . the model introduced by mermin",
    "is obtained from the well known spin - boson hamiltonian , by retaining only the lowest two levels of each harmonic oscillator comprising the environmental bath @xcite .",
    "the therefore describes a `` system '' spin-1/2 , represented by the pauli matrices @xmath1 , coupled to a set of @xmath2 `` environment '' spin-1/2 degrees of freedom , @xmath3 .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian , called the mermin model is given by [ ham ] h=- _ x + _ z _ j=1^n(s_j^+ + s_j^- ) + _",
    "j=1^ns_j^z  .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate a large @xmath2 variant of the model ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "as first noted by mermin , the model can be solved approximately in the @xmath4 limit , to demonstrate the correspondence between the onset of localization of the system spin and a second order phase transition @xcite . in this large @xmath2 model , the environment spins",
    "are summed to one big @xmath5 spin , @xmath6 , and contributions from the sectors of hilbert space with total spin @xmath7 are ignored .",
    "the then becomes [ ham2 ] h=- _ x + _ z s_x + s_z  .",
    "as mermin points out , the advantage of the ( [ ham2 ] ) is that in the limit @xmath4 , the environment spins may be replaced in the by the @xmath8 and @xmath9 components of a classical spin angular momentum : @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian may be diagonalized and its ground state eigenvalue , @xmath12 , given by e_0 ( ) = - -  , minimized with respect to @xmath13 .",
    "the critical behavior of the model may now be seen by examining the ground state energy @xmath14 , as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "the ground state energy , @xmath14 , bifurcates at a finite value of @xmath15 going from a singlet , non - degenerate root for @xmath16 to a doubly degenerate set for @xmath17 : @xmath18 in the former case , the environment is decoupled from the system and always points along the @xmath9-axis to minimize its `` zeeman '' energy corresponding to the last term of ( [ ham2 ] ) . in the latter case , the environment and the system spins are frozen in two distinct orientations with degenerate energies .",
    "the ground state wave function is still in a superposition @xmath19 , but is no longer an evenly weighted one ( @xmath20 ) ; rather , the two roots correspond to the system predominantly in @xmath21 or @xmath22 .    despite producing a localization transition ,",
    "this mean field solution is necessarily incomplete , for , it ignores quantum fluctuations of the bath ; _ i.e. _ , it provides no mechanism for dissipation . as a first step in this direction , we study the dynamics of the bath using the liouvillian operator method .",
    "this method has been applied successfully to study a wide variety of dissipative systems . using the liouvillian approach , shao and",
    "hnggi @xcite studied a spin - spin bath system similar to the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) above , but with an ohmic spectrum and found a phase diagram virtually identical to that of the sbh .",
    "dattagupta et al @xcite , studying the sbh , also employed a liouvillian approach and found close agreement with other analytic approaches to the sbh @xcite . to try to gain some insight into the mermin model beyond the mean field level ,",
    "we have adapted the resolvent operator calculation of shao and hnggi @xcite on the spin - spin bath model . in what follows ,",
    "we just outline the basic steps in the calculation and describe our results .",
    "a detailed review of the resolvent operator formalism can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) is rotated by @xmath23 to diagonalize the environment spin for the two orientations of the system spin .",
    "we then get [ ham3 ] h^ = - ( s^+ e^-2i _ 0 s_y + s^- e^+2i _ 0 s_y ) - s_z  .    to study the dynamics of the system spin , a suitable quantity to calculate is @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes quantum average at zero temperature . for a state prepared initially at @xmath26 , with the system and environment spin fully polarized ,",
    "the time dependent average of the system spin is given by @xmath27 where the first index of the ket is the system state and the second is the environment .",
    "the spin operator @xmath28 is in the heisenberg representation , and its time evolution is governed by the transformed hamiltonian , @xmath29 .",
    "we now introduce the liouvillian time evolution operator @xmath30 , which is defined generically for a @xmath31 , hilbert space @xmath32 and operator @xmath33 as follows : @xmath34 the time evolution operator @xmath35 is a fourth rank operator whose state space vectors are denoted by a ket - parenthesis , @xmath36 .",
    "all dynamical information is contained in @xmath37 and the laplace transform of @xmath37 @xmath38 is the most convenient form to calculate . for the initial conditions specified above , it follows that the laplace transform of @xmath39 is given by : @xmath40 where the @xmath41 s are the rotation group matrix elements , @xmath42    following dattagupta _",
    "@xcite , we concentrate on the `` environment - averaged '' time evolution operator defined by performing the environment sums in ( [ time_ev ] ) @xmath43 the liouvillian is now split into perturbation ( @xmath44 ) and environment ( @xmath45 ) parts , corresponding to the two terms in equation ( [ ham3 ] ) .",
    "then the environment averaged time development operator may be computed perturbatively as @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the liouvillian propagator for the environment degrees of freedom , @xmath49 .",
    "we can now calculate the above terms .",
    "the results through second order in @xmath15 for the three self - energies in the order appearing in equation ( [ selfenergy ] ) ( notated @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) are given below : @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 the outer product notation @xmath56 corresponds to @xmath57 .",
    "the @xmath9 dependences of @xmath51 are given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the bare energy difference .",
    "the fluctuation matrix elements are depicted graphically in fig .",
    "( [ fluctuation ] ) .",
    "since @xmath60 depends only upon @xmath61 , @xmath62 , may be written in terms of a relative index @xmath63 and the @xmath64 sum performed . for large @xmath65 , the matrix elements , as functions of @xmath63 , are peaked at the most probable values of @xmath63 .",
    "now , the two self energies may be written in the large @xmath65 , continuum limit as follows : @xmath66    = 3.5 in    0.5truein    these self energies can not be calculated in closed form ; however , they can be evaluated in several limits that are physically significant .",
    "for @xmath67 we find , @xmath68 and for @xmath69 , @xmath70 where @xmath71 .    to compute the laplace transform of @xmath39 the self energies ( [ m1 ] ) , ( [ m21 ] ) , and ( [ m22 ] )",
    "must be inserted in eqn .",
    "( [ av_q ] ) and the fourth rank operator inverted",
    ". the general form is complicated , but for small @xmath9 , the analytic structure reduces to @xmath72 in the limit of large environmental coupling , the real pole dominates and the behavior for @xmath39 is exponential decay ; at zero temperature , the system prepared in one state will leak into the other state .",
    "thus , we get , @xmath73 for small environmental coupling , the pole in @xmath74 is imaginary and @xmath39 oscillates , given by @xmath75 the results eq .",
    "( [ decay ] ) and ( [ oscillation ] ) summarize the two extremal behaviors of @xmath39 , but give no information about the critical point between .",
    "there are two main differences between the predictions of the liouvillian perturbative scheme and the exact numerical behavior .",
    "first , the liouvillian formalism does not capture the phase transition observed in finite size scaling of the numerical results ( as well as in the mean field solution ) described below .",
    "this result is interesting , given that the liouvillian formalism does describe the phase transition at @xmath76 of the spin - boson @xcite and spin - spin bath @xcite models .",
    "consequently , one would expect it to work for the simpler monochromatic spectrum of the mermin model .",
    "secondly , the liouvillian formalism predicts exponential decay in @xmath77 for large environmental coupling @xmath78 .",
    "the corresponding spectral function is lorentzian centered at @xmath79 , similar to that of the spin - boson model at the toulouse point @xmath80 .",
    "however , in our numerical results we will show that the spectral function has only a finite energy @xmath81 feature and an exponentially small frequency @xmath82 delta function feature ( for environmental coupling larger than the critical value . )    let us now summarize briefly , our numerical findings .",
    "the transition to decoherence is induced by strong coupling to environmental degrees of freedom ( large @xmath78 ) , or , equivalently , a small system energy scale ( small @xmath15 ) . below a critical coupling , @xmath83 , all spectral weight of the dynamical [ imchi ] _ -^dt 0|[(t),(0)]|0 ( t ) e^it resides in the principal resonance of the two level system at an energy @xmath15 .",
    "when the coupling is larger than @xmath83 , a new exponentially small energy scale @xmath84 emerges , associated with a broken symmetry , @xmath85 , in the thermodynamic limit @xmath86 .",
    "this feature corresponds to tunneling modified by a franck - condon type overlap factor .",
    "as the coupling is increased , spectral weight is shifted continuously to the `` near - zero '' frequency channel .",
    "the weight of the delta - function , @xmath87 , is simply the order parameter , @xmath88 ( or , more exactly , @xmath89 , for large but finite @xmath2 ) .",
    "however , the dynamical obeys a sum rule , implying that an incompletely formed broken symmetry state leaves some spectral weight at the position of the principal resonance , set by @xmath15 .    to calculate the dynamical susceptibility we consider the response of the system ( [ ham2 ] ) to an external field @xmath90 : [ ham_ext ] h _",
    "= -h    the ( [ ham2 ] ) was diagonalized and the complete order parameter matrix , @xmath91 , was computed .",
    "it is natural to work with the dimensionless coupling constant , @xmath92 ; the critical coupling implied in the @xmath4 calculation is then @xmath93 .",
    "= 3.5 in    fig .",
    "( [ linear_sus ] ) shows the behavior of @xmath94 as the system energy scale @xmath15 is reduced , corresponding to a range @xmath95 .",
    "these computations were performed for @xmath96 .",
    "computations on larger spin environments ( up to @xmath97 ) suggest that there is little change beyond @xmath96 .",
    "an artificial broadening ( @xmath98 ) was added to make the features more visible .",
    "as seen in this sequence , @xmath99 is marked by the appearance of the franck - condon resonance at an exponentially small energy scale ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "the spectral weight remaining at @xmath101 when @xmath102 clearly exhibits inelastic broadening , although the resonance essentially disappears before becoming critically damped .",
    "the counterpart , at finite @xmath2 , to @xmath103 at infinite @xmath2 is the spectral weight at the franck - condon resonance , @xmath104 .",
    "3 demonstrates that @xmath105 behaves as expected in a second order phase transition ; the slope at @xmath106 grows with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "the matrix , @xmath107 , and consequently , @xmath94 , obey a sum rule : [ sum_rule ] _",
    "i|_ij|^2 = 1 an incompletely developed broken symmetry ( @xmath108 ) means that spectral weight remains at the principal resonance at @xmath109 .",
    "= 3.5 in    the quantum fluctuations missed by the mean field analysis but captured in the numerics may be qualitatively divided into two types : overlap effects and inelastic effects . in the former type",
    ", the system in the @xmath21 state leaves an `` imprint '' upon the environment which , being nearly orthogonal to the imprint left by system state @xmath22 , reduces the tunneling amplitude by an exponentially small factor .",
    "the new tunnel splitting is thus reduced by a franck - condon type overlap factor : ^ * = _ 0|r_y(2_0)|_0 = ^n_0 = where @xmath110 is the rotation operator .",
    "the resonance then shifts from @xmath109 to a smaller energy scale @xmath84 . in the inelastic type fluctuation , the system forces the environment to make transitions to an excited state dissipating an amount energy @xmath111 per period .",
    "the resonance is then broadened by @xmath112 but remains nominally at @xmath109 .",
    "these results show that the spin dynamics of the mermin model is significantly different from that of the sbh with an ohmic bath .",
    "the former , as our results show , only exhibits overlap effects at the critical coupling , but not before . in the sbh",
    ", the coupling to the environment produces _ finite _ overlap effects for all couplings @xmath113 , and a franck - condon type reduction in energy scale , given by : @xmath114 at the same time , inelastic effects decohere the resonance leading to the toulouse limit ( at @xmath115 ) , prior to localization ( which occurs at @xmath76 ) , and corresponding to a complete inelastic broadening of the resonance . @xcite . in the mermin model , the quantum resonance of the system spin , although damped , remains intact through the localization transition .",
    "in this paper we have compared the dynamical behavior of a quantum dissipative system possessing a monochromatic spectrum ( the mermin model ) with that of the spin - boson model which possesses a continuous bath spectrum .",
    "we find an important difference between the dynamical behavior of the two models , with the mermin model reaching a localized state , as environmental coupling is increased , without the primary resonance becoming overdamped .",
    "when the critical coupling is reached , spectral weight is tranferred across a gap of @xmath109 to a zero frequency delta function , indicating the presence of a localized state . in effect",
    ", the mermin model exhibits no _ finite _",
    "environmental overlap effects until an infinite one  the orthogonality catastrophe  localizes the system .",
    "in contrast , the primary resonant feature in spin - boson model must soften to zero frequency and become completely overdamped ( the toulouse point @xmath115 ) before a localized spectral feature appears at @xmath76 .",
    "furthermore , the liouvillian technique , which has been successful in capturing the localization phase transition in the sbh and related models fails for the mermin model .",
    "the mermin model is a prototype system for a weakly coupled @xmath116 monochromatic spin bath , and judging from the results of hanggi , a weakly coupled monchromatic _",
    "bath is likely to exhibit the same behavior . in contrast",
    ", the spin - boson model employs a featureless , power - law spectrum of envrionmental oscillators and exhibits universal behavior that depends only upon the exponent of the spectrum .",
    "this behavior , in the ohmic case , includes a localization transition , but one with a qualitatively different character than that of the mermin model .",
    "it is natural , then , to ask under what conditions does a quantum environment become sufficiently `` featureless '' to fit into the universal framework of the spin - boson model ?",
