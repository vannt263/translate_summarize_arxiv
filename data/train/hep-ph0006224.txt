    "understanding the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking is without question the most important open problem in particle physics . on the experimental side , despite a wealth of precision data that shows convincingly that the electroweak interactions are described by a spontaneously broken @xmath6 gauge theory , we still have no direct information about the dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking . on the theoretical side , there are only a handful of mechanisms known for electroweak symmetry breaking that can naturally explain the enormous hierarchy between the weak scale @xmath7 and more fundamental scales such as the unification scale @xmath8 and the planck scale @xmath9 .",
    "the oldest idea is that new qcd - like strong dynamics near the weak scale are responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "this idea , known as ` technicolor ' , is currently out of favor because of phenomenological problems and the difficulty of constructing compelling models .",
    "perhaps the most attractive and well - studied idea is supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite .",
    "most recently , there has been a great deal of interest in the idea that the fundamental planck scale is near the weak scale , thus obviating the hierarchy problem . in such scenarios the observed weakness of gravity compared to the weak interactions is explained by the presence of large extra dimensions felt only by gravity @xcite or by the effects of gravitational curvature in extra dimensions @xcite . in this paper , we consider a new class of models in which electroweak symmetry is broken by strong _",
    "supersymmetric _ dynamics at the tev scale .",
    "supersymmetry is assumed to be broken softly at the weak scale , but this breaking is small enough to be viewed as a perturbation on the strong dynamics .",
    "electroweak symmetry is broken by a vev for a composite operator made of scalars arising from a non - perturbative ` deformed moduli space ' @xcite .",
    "the nambu - goldstone bosons that become the longitudinal components of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 are composites of scalars . in this sense",
    ", the mechanism can be viewed as the ` superpartner ' of the technicolor mechanism , in which the condensate and the longitudinal component of the gauge bosons are fermion composites .",
    "we therefore call this mechanism ` @xmath2-color ' , where the ` @xmath2 ' stands for ` super ' or ` scalar '",
    ". we will show that these models elegantly avoid all of the problems of technicolor models , and compare favorably with other susy models in terms of naturalness and simplicity .",
    "most importantly , these models give a viable and well - motivated scenario for strongly - coupled supersymmetric physics at the tev scale .",
    "the models have many interesting signatures , including a non - minimal higgs sector , non - standard yukawa couplings , and an approximately supersymmetric spectrum of strong resonances in the tev region .",
    "it is interesting to compare these models with non - supersymmetric technicolor models .",
    "technicolor models have difficulty generating fermion masses without generating large flavor - changing neutral currents @xcite .",
    "the models we consider have no problem with fermion masses because they contain an elementary higgs multiplet that gets a vev by mixing with the composite fields of the @xmath2-color sector .",
    "the fermion masses therefore arise from ordinary yukawa couplings , and the usual gim mechanism suppresses fcnc s .",
    "also , technicolor models generally give rise to large positive contributions to the electroweak @xmath2 parameter from strong resonances in the tev region @xcite . in the models we consider ,",
    "the sign of @xmath2 is not determined by any currently known method .",
    "other radiative corrections are also naturally under control .    compared to more traditional susy models , these models also have a number of attractive features .",
    "for example , the @xmath5 problem can be solved by the @xmath2-color dynamics .",
    "also , the lightest neutral higgs boson can be significantly more massive than @xmath4 due to mixing with the composite states .",
    "perhaps the least appealing feature of these models is that the susy breaking masses must be close to the @xmath2-color scale , even though they do not originate from the @xmath2-color dynamics .",
    "we will show that this can be natural if the @xmath2-color group is near a conformal fixed point and is driven away from the fixed point by low - scale susy breaking , for example from gauge - mediated susy breaking .",
    "we will present a model that incorporates this mechanism , together with a dynamical solution to the @xmath5 problem and gauge unification , all without excessive complication .",
    "a model very similar to the ones considered here were discussed in , which appeared while this paper was in progress . however , the model of has a massless fermion with couplings to the @xmath1 , and is therefore ruled out .- type soft masses . see section 2 . ] also , electroweak radiative corrections are not discussed in .",
    "however , the idea that there can be strong approximately supersymmetric dynamics at the tev scale appears for the first time in .",
    "the models presented here also have some similarities with ` bosonic technicolor ' models @xcite , which involve both susy and strong dynamics near the tev scale .",
    "however , in bosonic technicolor , susy breaking scalar masses are large compared to the strong dynamical scale , so the dynamics that breaks electroweak symmetry is completely non - supersymmetric .",
    "therefore , in bosonic technicolor the spectrum of strong resonances at the tev scale is non - supersymmetric , and the @xmath2 parameter is unsuppressed and positive .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we analyze a minimal ( but realistic ) model that illustrates the main features of the idea . in section 3",
    ", we consider an extension of the model analyzed in section 2 that incorporates a solution to the @xmath5 problem . in section 4",
    ", we estimate the electroweak radiative corrections in this class of models . in section 5",
    ", we discuss a mechanism that can explain the coincidence of the @xmath2-color scale and the scale of soft susy breaking , and account for gauge coupling unification .",
    "section 6 contains some speculations on phenomenology and our conclusions .",
    "we now present a simple model that illustrates the main features of the mechanism .",
    "the non - abelian symmetries of the model are su(2)_sc su(2)_l su(2)_r , where @xmath10 is the @xmath2-color gauge group , @xmath11 is the weak gauge group , and we only gauge the @xmath12 subgroup of @xmath13 which is generated by the @xmath14 generator .",
    "the fields are t_l ~ ( , , ) , t_r ~ ( , , ) , h ~ ( , , ) , and two singlets @xmath15 .",
    "the field @xmath16 therefore contains a pair of doublet higgs fields , and the fields @xmath17 and @xmath18 are a supersymmetric version of minimal technicolor @xcite .",
    "the theory has a tree - level superpotential w = _",
    "l s_l t_l t_l + _ r s_r t_r t_r + _ h h t_l",
    "t_r + h h. these terms break all global @xmath19 symmetries , which is important for avoiding massless fermions or axions .",
    "the gauge symmetries allow the addition of a superpotential term w = _ h h t_l ( t_r _ 3 ) that violates custodial @xmath20 .",
    "we will ignore this term for simplicity when discussing the effective potential , but we will return to it when we discuss electroweak radiative corrections . the elementary higgs fields , @xmath16 ,",
    "are also assumed to have yukawa couplings to the quark and lepton fields .",
    "these are important for generating the quark and lepton masses , but they do not play a role for the vacuum structure as long as the squark and slepton fields do not get vev s .",
    "the strong @xmath2-color dynamics has a global @xmath21 symmetry that is broken only by standard - model gauge interactions and trilinear superpotential couplings . under @xmath21 ,",
    "the @xmath2-colored fields transform as a fundamental : t^j = ~ , j = 1 ,  , 4 .",
    "the @xmath10 group has a deformed moduli space @xcite .",
    "this means that below the scale @xmath22 where the theory becomes strong , the light degrees of freedom correspond to the ` meson ' fields @xmath23 : m^jk = -m^kj = , , subject to the constraint ( m ) = b_l b_r - ( ) 0 . under @xmath24",
    "the composite fields transform as ~ ( , ) , b_l ~ ( , ) , b_r ~ ( , ) . in order to be realistic",
    ", this theory must incorporate soft susy breaking .",
    "term in , then this model dynamically breaks susy @xcite .",
    "however , this can not be the only source of susy breaking since it gives very small ( gauge - mediated ) masses to standard - model gauginos and scalars .",
    "even if we add soft susy breaking by hand , the model without the @xmath5 term gives rise to an ` extra ' goldstino that couples to the @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , we must complicate the model to ensure that it does _ not _ dynamically break susy ! ] since the strong dynamics is responsible for breaking electroweak symmetry , the required soft susy breaking terms are not much smaller than the dynamical scale of the @xmath2-color dynamics .",
    "however , we will see that dimensional analysis ( nda ) @xcite indicates that it is sensible to treat soft susy breaking as a perturbation ,    denote the scale where the @xmath2-color dynamics becomes strong by @xmath22 . in a normalization where the composite fields have kinetic terms of order 1",
    ", the quantum constraint can be written @xcite ( ) - b_l b_r = f^2 , and the effective superpotential is w_eff = f + h h , where @xmath25 .",
    "we have used our freedom to normalize the fields to set various coefficients to 1 ; in this normalization , all of the unknown strong interaction coefficients appear in the effective potential for the composite fields .",
    "@xmath21 symmetry and nda tells us that the effective potential is k_eff & = f^2 k ( ) + & = f^2 k ( ) , where @xmath26 is an unknown order-1 function .",
    "we know that @xmath27 for all field values in order that the theory has a positive kinetic term in the susy limit .    from the above",
    ", we see that we require @xmath28 , which implies @xmath29 .",
    "the soft masses must be of order @xmath30 , so nda implies that susy breaking perturbations are suppressed by @xmath31 .",
    "some of our results rely on nda , so it is reassuring to note that nda for soft susy breaking is known to work well in supersymmetric theories where exact results are available @xcite .",
    "note also that in qcd , the strange quark mass breaks @xmath32 flavor symmetry by an amount @xmath33 , a perturbation just as large as the one we are contemplating .",
    "the fact that @xmath32 is a useful approximate symmetry in qcd is thus further support that the expansion we are performing is sensible .    at this point",
    ", there is no explanation for the near coincidence of the scales @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "also , the @xmath5 term must be put in by hand , and must be the same order as @xmath35 . in section 3 we will discuss extensions of this model that can address these issues . however",
    ", the present model gives a simple and realistic illustration of the mechanism we are proposing .",
    "to solve the quantum constraint , we write ^j_k = ( _ 0 _ 2 + i_a _ a)^j_k , h^j_k = ( h_0 _ 2 + i h_a _ a)^j_k , where @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) are the pauli matrices .",
    "this gives h = h_0 _ 0 + h_a _ a , ( ) = ( _ 0 ^ 2 + _ a _ a ) , . solving for @xmath38 gives _ 0 = ( f^2 + 2 b_l b_r - _ a _ a ) ^1/2 .",
    "we therefore parameterize the moduli space by @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 ; this parameterization is non - singular for all vacua where @xmath42 . in this way",
    "we obtain the unconstrained effective superpotential w_eff = & f \\ { _ l s_l b_l + _ r",
    "s_r b_r + _ h } + & + ( h_0 ^ 2 + h_a h_a ) , where @xmath38 is eliminated using .",
    "similarly , @xmath38 should also be eliminated in the effective potential .",
    "we now discuss the vacua in the susy limit .",
    "the @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath41 equations of motion give respectively h_0 & = -_h f _ 0 , + f _ h _ a & = - h_a , + h_0 _ a & = h_a _ 0 , where @xmath38 is given by . substituting into reproduces , so we find three flat directions .",
    "the moduli space of vacua includes a subspace where @xmath45 i.e. the gauge symmetry breaks as @xmath46 . in these vacua",
    ", electroweak symmetry is broken in the correct pattern in the susy limit , and the three flat directions are associated with the nambu - goldstone bosons of the symmetry breaking .    to obtain a realistic model we must include soft susy breaking with @xmath47 .",
    "we must then check that there are choices for the fundamental soft masses where electroweak symmetry is broken .",
    "an important point is that the potential has no global @xmath19 symmetries , so there is no danger of obtaining a weak - scale axion .",
    "the potential is not calculable in this model , because when we include soft susy breaking the potential depends on the full functional form of the effective potential , parameterized by the function @xmath26 defined in .",
    "this is simply because in units where @xmath48 , the potential is an order-1 function of an order-1 argument .",
    "derivatives of the potential appear multiplicatively in the potential , and do not affect the vev s in the susy limit .",
    "however , for @xmath49 , these multiplicative corrections are parametrically as important as the soft mass contributions to the potential . without knowledge of the potential we can not determine rigorously whether vacua of the desired form exist . however , given the large number of free parameters in the soft masses , it is reasonable to assume that there are vacua that break electroweak symmetry in the desired fashion .",
    "we now turn to the fermion masses .",
    "we first neglect gaugino masses . in the presence of a nontrivial potential and susy breaking ,",
    "the fermion mass matrix is proportional to m_ab = + , where we denote the fields by @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 , _",
    "etc_. the physical fermion mass matrices are given by matrix products of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , but the important fact for our purposes is that massless fermions are present if and only if @xmath55 .",
    "the determinant of @xmath56 is thus an important diagnostic , and we find that it is nonzero for general vev s .",
    "the precise expression depends on the form of the effective potential , and is complicated and unenlightening ; for example , if we assume that the potential is @xmath57 , and assume @xmath58 , @xmath59 , we find ( m ) = -f^7 _ h^3 _ l^2 _ r^2 ( + _ h f)^3 .",
    "this vanishes for susy vacua ( see ) , but is nonzero ( and nonsingular ) for general vev s .",
    "when we include the gauginos , there are mass terms that mix the gauginos with some of the fermions above , as part of the susy higgs effect .",
    "these mixing mass terms are of order @xmath4 , so the non - vanishing of the determinant above shows that there are no massless fermions in the limit @xmath60 .",
    "this is important because it shows that there are no fermions whose mass comes entirely from the susy higgs effect , so there is no reason that all fermions can not be heavier than @xmath4 .",
    "the nonzero electroweak gauge couplings can in principle give rise to light fermions , but only for special parameter choices .",
    "we conclude that the fermion masses do not present a phenomenological problem for this model .",
    "an undesirable feature of the present model is that it contains an explicit ` @xmath5 term ' .",
    "this term must be of order the weak scale : if @xmath5 is large compared to the weak scale , the elementary higgs fields @xmath16 decouple and we do not generate quark and lepton masses ; if @xmath5 is too small we have light fermions ( see ) .",
    "( the only difference from the @xmath5 problem in the mssm is that the present model can break electroweak symmetry for any value of @xmath5 . ) in the next section , we show that a simple modification of the model can solve this problem .",
    "we close this section by considering what happens when @xmath61 .",
    "then the singlets @xmath15 decouple , and we obtain the model of .",
    "this model has an anomaly - free global @xmath62 symmetry , where the @xmath63 is ` @xmath2-baryon ' number .",
    "the @xmath64 symmetry is broken explicitly by soft susy breaking terms .",
    "assumes that @xmath59 in order to avoid spontaneously breaking the @xmath63 . in this case",
    ", we find that there is a massless ` baryon ' fermion in the spectrum .",
    "this fermion has unsuppressed couplings to the @xmath1 , and is therefore ruled out .",
    "the massless fermion can be avoided by allowing @xmath65 . in order to avoid a weak - scale axion",
    ", @xmath63 must be broken explicitly .",
    "this can be done by adding the @xmath66-type soft susy breaking mass terms @xmath67 , @xmath68 to the potential .",
    "the origin of these terms in a specific model of susy breaking may be difficult to understand , since there are no terms with the same symmetries in the susy part of the theory .",
    "we can eliminate the @xmath5 problem simply by replacing the @xmath5 term with a cubic interaction : w = _",
    "l s_l t_l t_l + _ r s_r",
    "t_r t_r + _ h h t_l t_r + y ( s_l + s_r ) h h. the symmetry between the @xmath69 and @xmath70 cubic couplings is not essential ; it merely simplifies the form of the vev s in the model",
    ". we can also include further cubic interactions for the singlets @xmath69 and @xmath70 , but these do not lead to qualitatively different results . note that all global @xmath19 symmetries are broken .    in the susy limit ,",
    "the vev s are determined by = & f _",
    "l b_l + y(h_0 h_0 + h_a h_a ) , + w = & f _",

    ", so we again find three flat directions .",
    "solving the remaining equations for the special case @xmath71 , we obtain & = ( 2 _ l _ r)^1/4 f , + = & = _ h ( 2 ) ^1/4 f , + & = - ( _ r ) ^1/2 f , + & = - ( _ l ) ^1/2 f. + we see that there are points on the moduli space where electroweak symmetry is broken in the correct pattern . in addition , the nonzero vev for the singlets gives an effective @xmath5 term for the higgs doublets .",
    "the inclusion of soft susy breaking proceeds as for the simpler model above .",
    "the details are not enlightening , and will not be given here .",
    "we expect that there is a vacuum with the desired properties for reasonable choices of soft masses .",
    "we also computed the determinant of the fermion mass matrix to check that there are no light fermions .",
    "as in the previous model , we find that the fermion determinant is nonzero and unsuppressed for non - supersymmetric vev s .",
    "the discussion is similar to that for the simpler model , but the expressions are more complicated .",
    "we now discuss electroweak radiative corrections in these models . this is particularly interesting because it is generally believed that models in which electroweak symmetry is broken by strong dynamics are strongly constrained by the electroweak @xmath2 parameter @xcite .",
    "however , we show that in the present model this is not the case",
    ". we will show that other radiative corrections are also small .",
    "the @xmath2 parameter can be viewed as a gauge kinetic mixing term between @xmath11 and @xmath12 gauge groups in an effective theory below the scale @xmath22 where electroweak symmetry is broken : _ eff = -s g g f^_l f_y  . in our model ,",
    "the leading contribution to @xmath2 comes from operators of the form d^4 + , where @xmath72 is the gauge covariant susy derivative , and @xmath73 by nda . putting in vev s for @xmath74 we find s ~ ~0.3 .",
    "note that there are no large multiplicity factors , since there is only a single electroweak doublet charged under a strongly coupled @xmath20 gauge group .",
    "the most recent particle data group analysis of precision electroweak data gives @xmath75 for the standard model with @xmath76 , and @xmath77 for @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "we see that the estimates above are compatible with the data , provided that the sign of @xmath2 can be negative .",
    "it is therefore very encouraging that the sign of the contribution to @xmath2 is not determined by the usual arguments in qcd - like theories , because of the crucial role played by scalars in these theories .",
    "clearly we can not use qcd data to directly estimate @xmath2 in these theories .",
    "an alternative approach in qcd - like theories uses the weinberg sum rules @xcite together with the less rigorous resonance saturation `` aproximation '' to estimate @xmath2 .",
    "the first step is to use the operator product expansion ( ope ) to find the short - distance behavior of the current - current correlation function relevant for @xmath2 : d^4 x e^i p x & t j_l",
    "a^(x ) j_r b^(0 ) + & ~ ( t_l^_l a t_l ) ( t_r^_r b t_r ) + , [ correlator ] where @xmath79 are the scalar components of the @xmath2-colored fields . in qcd ,",
    "the leading operator on the is a quartic fermion term , and the correlation function behaves as @xmath80 rather than @xmath81 .",
    "this implies that only the first weinberg sum rule holds in the present class of theories .",
    "the weinberg sum rules can be written in terms of spectral density functions for vector and axial - vector channels @xcite . making the assumption that these sum rules are approximately saturated by the lowest - lying single particle intermediate states with vector and axial - vector quantum numbers , the first and second sum rules yield f_^2-f_a^2 & = f_^2 + f_^2 m_^2-f_a^2 m_a^2 & = 0  . with these assumptions , @xmath2 is given by @xcite s = 4 ( f_^2-f_a^2 )  . using both sum rules and ,",
    "one one can show that @xmath82 , @xmath83 and hence that @xmath84 .",
    "however in a susy theory with only the first weinberg sum rule we can reach no conclusion as to the sign of @xmath2 . abandoning the saturation approximation we have even less information .",
    "yet another approach to determining the sign of @xmath2 is to apply vafa - witten @xcite positivity arguments to current - current correlators .",
    "however , in spite of significant efforts along these lines , the sign of @xmath2 has not been determined in this way for a qcd - like theory @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the vafa - witten arguments generally break down in theories ( such as supersymmetric theories ) that include scalars with yukawa couplings .",
    "we conclude that there is no reason to believe that @xmath2 can not be negative in this class of models . in the remainder of this section",
    ", we will argue that the @xmath85 term contributions to @xmath2 are much smaller than the contribution of .",
    "this is a somewhat surprising result , because there is an operator d^2 ( w^)^j_k ( w_)^_n _ jrs m^kn m^rs + that is invariant under all symmetries , and that gives a nonzero value for @xmath2 .",
    "nda implies that the the contribution to @xmath2 from this operator is the same as , so the conclusions above would not be affected if this operator is present .",
    "the remainder of this subsection is therefore primarily of theoretical interest , and the reader interested mainly in the results is urged to skip to the next subsection .",
    "we begin by classifying the possible @xmath85 terms that can contribute to @xmath2 . for this",
    ", it is important to keep track of the @xmath21 symmetry of the strong dynamics .",
    "the elementary higgs fields and composite ` meson ' fields fall into @xmath21 representations _",
    "jk = ~ , m^jk = ~ , while the @xmath24 field strengths are in the @xmath21 adjoint : ( w_)^j_k ~ ~*ad*. in this notation , the tree - level superpotential of the model of section 3 is w = _ jk m^jk + y^jkn pq _ jk _ n_p",
    "q , where @xmath86 contains the cubic term in .",
    "in addition , there is an anomaly - free @xmath64 symmetry with r(m ) = 0 , r ( ) = 2 , r(w _ ) = 1 , r(y ) = -4 .",

    "therefore @xmath64 invariance then does not allow any dependence of the @xmath89-independent part of @xmath88 on @xmath95 .",
    "we are left with terms where @xmath88 is a function of @xmath74 only .",
    "it is not hard to see that is the only possibility , taking into account the quantum constraint .",
    "however , we claim that the operator can not be present in the theory because it can not arise from the theory with an additional massive flavor .",

    "we now turn to the possibility that the operator is generated in the theory with 6 fundamentals when we integrate out the massive modes . for @xmath104 we can integrate out the massive modes using the confined description .",
    "the operator does not appear at any order in the perturbative expansion , as follows from conventional perturbative non - renormalization theorems .",
    "we believe that there are no non - perturbative corrections to the matching that can give , since the effective theory is simply a weakly coupled wess - zumino model .",
    "this argument is valid only for @xmath105 , but there can be no phase transitions as a function of a holomorphic coupling in the susy limit , so we conclude that the operator vanishes even for @xmath106",

    ", we obtain ~. for @xmath111 , the @xmath2-color contribution is as large as the top contribution , but we can easily obtain an acceptable contribution for moderately small values of @xmath112 . is somewhat smaller than @xmath113 , since electroweak symmetry breaking is distributed between four higgs doublets . ]",
    "why is @xmath114 ? it could be a coincidence just like @xmath115 . however , it is not difficult to construct models where the strong interaction scale of @xmath2-color is fixed by susy breaking .",
    "the idea is that the @xmath2-color gauge dynamics is near a strongly coupled fixed point , and is perturbed away from this fixed point by susy breaking , similar to ` postmodern ' technicolor theories @xcite .",
    "for example , in our model , @xmath10 would have an infrared fixed point if there were four or five flavors rather than two .",
    "if the additional @xmath2-colored fields are electroweak singlets and receive masses somewhat larger than @xmath35 , then the @xmath2-color gauge coupling rapidly becomes strongly coupled near the scale @xmath35 .",
    "for an explicit example of this type of model , consider a theory with four @xmath2-color flavors , one electroweak doublet and two electroweak singlets , as well as a gauge singlet @xmath116 with a superpotential term w = x^3 .",
    "suppose that @xmath116 gets a negative soft mass squared of order @xmath117 .",
    "( we will discuss how this can happen below . )",
    "the potential for @xmath116 is v ~-m_soft^2    @xmath118 . for small @xmath119",
    ", @xmath116 gets a vev larger than @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath116 has yukawa couplings to the @xmath2-colored electroweak singlets , then they can be integrated out and the @xmath2-color gauge coupling will rapidly go from fixed point behavior to strong coupling .",
    "this threshold is not supersymmetric , but @xmath120 .",
    "this susy breaking feeds into @xmath2-colored superpartners through @xmath2-color gauge mediation , but this gives corrections smaller than @xmath35 .",
    "one might also wonder what becomes of unification since the @xmath2-color particles we have added to the mssm are not in complete @xmath121 multiplets .",
    "there are many ways to achieve unification with the addition of further particles .",
    "an attractive possibility is that these may be responsible for gauge - mediating susy breaking to the ordinary superpartners .",
    "a simple example is to add a vector - like right - handed up quark to the model of this section . with the @xmath2-color particles responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking described above this",
    "makes an approximate @xmath121 multiplet .",
    "the sm gauge couplings unify if the vector - like quark mass is near @xmath122  gev . if the vector - like quark is the gauge messenger of susy breaking for the usual superpartners then the spectrum of superpartner masses will differ from the usual scenarios , since the messengers are not complete @xmath121 multiplets .",
    "we have presented models that dynamically break electroweak symmetry via strong supersymmetric ( ` @xmath2-color ' ) dynamics .",
    "our analysis of the dynamics is based on exact non - perturbative results in supersymmetric gauge theories , and is therefore on a firm theoretical foundation .",
    "the failure of the second weinberg sum - rule shows that the @xmath2 parameter can have either sign , and is thus potentially consistent with precision electroweak data .",
    "one of our models gives a solution to the ` @xmath5 problem . '",
    "simple extensions of these models can relate the supersymmetry breaking scale to the @xmath2-color scale and allow for gauge coupling unification .",
    "the phenomenology of these models is very exciting .",
    "the spectrum contains the mssm spectrum with two extra ( composite ) higgs doublets .",
    "in addition , the theory is strongly coupled with a rich spectrum of supersymmetric strong interaction resonances in the tev range , and therefore will exhibit anomalous @xmath123 scattering .",
    "yukawa couplings are larger than in the mssm ( or the standard model ) , since electroweak symmetry breaking is distributed between composite and fundamental higgses .",
    "we hope that this approach to electroweak symmetry breaking will stimulate further theoretical and experimental work on the possibility of strong dynamics at the tev scale .",
