    "the chemical properties of particles at low temperatures are expected to be quite different from those at high temperatures . at high temperatures ,",
    "a chemical reaction rate is determined by the probability of overcoming the energy barrier between the reactant and the product as the result of thermal fluctuations . however , at low temperatures , where the wave nature of a particle plays an important role in the chemical reaction , tunneling of the energy barrier affects both the reaction and the reaction rate . in such situations ,",
    "the reaction rate may differ significantly from that predicted by classical mechanics .",
    "in addition , at extremely low temperatures , the quantum statistics of the particles influence the chemical reaction , and either bosonic enhancement @xcite or suppression due to fermi statistics is expected to be observed .",
    "a hybrid system of ultracold atoms and ions offers an ideal platform for the study of chemical reactions at extremely low temperatures , since sophisticated techniques to efficiently cool and detect atoms and ions have been developed . as an example , the elastic and inelastic collision cross - sections between ultracold atoms and ions have been successfully determined for various atom - ion combinations @xcite .",
    "more recently , a charge exchange collision , which is one of the elementary processes occurring in chemical reactions , was observed at the single - particle level using a trapped @xmath3yb@xmath4 ion immersed in a bose - einstein condensate of @xmath5rb atoms @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is necessary to work in the ultralow temperature regime , at which only a few partial waves contribute to the atom - ion interactions , in order to experimentally observe the quantum statistical nature of a chemical reaction in an atom - ion hybrid system .",
    "typically , the threshold energy of the quantum collision regime is given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the reduced mass of an atom of mass @xmath8 and an ion of mass @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are the atomic polarizability , the charge of the ion , and the vacuum permittivity , respectively .",
    "it is evident from the expression for @xmath14 that it is advantageous to choose an atom - ion combination with a small reduced mass when attempting to work in the quantum collision regime .",
    "in addition , recent theoretical research has demonstrated that the heating effect in an atom - ion hybrid system resulting from ion micromotion ( rapidly driven motion in a paul trap ) can be minimized by employing a small @xmath15 ratio @xcite . knowing this",

    "in addition , by identifying the collision products as li@xmath2 ions via mass spectrometry with parametric excitation , we were able to ascertain that the inelastic collisions were charge exchange collisions .",

    "this value is also sufficiently low so as to maintain the system in the quantum collision regime over a reasonable experimental timescale .",
    "although the energy scale of our hybrid system is currently dominated by the ion temperature ( @xmath23 mk ) , which remains above the energy threshold of the quantum collision regime , this particular combination is nevertheless one of the most promising candidates for the study of ultracold atom - ion chemical reaction .",
