    "economics lines of thought @xcite , knowledge can be treated as one of the `` production factors '' , - i.e. , one of the main causes of wealth in modern capitalistic societies .    according to marshall @xcite a `` * capital * '' is a collection of goods external to the economic agent that can be sold for money and from which an income can be derived .",
    "often , knowledge is parametrized as such a `` * human capital * '' @xcite .",
    "walsh @xcite was one pioneer in treating human knowledge as if it was a `` capital '' , in the economic sense ; he made an attempt to find measures for this form of `` capital '' .",
    "bourdieu @xcite , coleman @xcite , putnam @xcite , becker and collaborators have further implanted the concept of such a `` human capital '' in economic theory @xcite .",
    "however , the concept of knowledge as a form of capital is an oversimplification .",
    "this global - like concept does not account for many properties of knowledge strictly connected to the individual , such as the possibility for different learning paths or different views , multiple levels of interpretation , and different preferences @xcite .",
    "in fact , knowledge develops in a quite complex social context , within possibly different frameworks or time scales , and involves `` tacit dimensions '' ( beside the basic space and time dimensions ) requiring coding and decoding @xcite .",
    "+      science policy - makers and scholars have for many decades wished to develop quantitative methods for describing and predicting the initiation and growth of science research @xcite .",
    "thus , scientometrics has become one of the core research activities in view of constructing science and technology indicators @xcite .",
    "the accumulation of the knowledge in a country s population arises either from acquiring knowledge from abroad or from internal engines @xcite .",
    "the main engines for the production of new knowledge in a country are usually : the public research institutes , the universities and training institutes , the firms , and the individuals @xcite .",
    "the users of the knowledge are firms , governments , public institutions ( such as the national education , health , or security institutions ) , social organizations , and any concerned individual .",
    "the knowledge is transferred from producers to the users by dissemination that is realized by some flow or diffusion of process @xcite , sometimes involving physical migration .",
    "knowledge typically appears at first as purely tacit : _ a person `` has '' an idea _ @xcite .",
    "this tacit knowledge must be codified for further use ; after codification , knowledge can be stored in different ways , as in textbooks or digital carriers .",
    "it can be transferred from one system to another .",
    "in addition to knowledge creation , a system can gain knowledge by knowledge exchange and/or trade .",
    "in knowledge diffusion , the knowledge is transferred while subjects interact @xcite .",
    "pioneering studies on knowledge diffusion investigated the patterns through which new technologies are spread in social systems @xcite .",
    "the gain of knowledge due to knowledge diffusion is one of the keys or leads to innovative products and innovations @xcite .     +    in science , the diffusion of knowledge is mainly connected to the transfer of scientific information by publications .",
    "it is accepted that the results of some research become completely scientific when they are published @xcite .",
    "such a diffusion can also take place at scientific meetings and through oral or other exchanges , sometimes without formal publication of exchanged ideas @xcite .",
    "understanding the diffusion of knowledge requires research complementary to mathematical investigations . for example",
    ", mathematics can not indicate why the exposure to ideas leads to intellectual epidemics .",
    "yet , mathematics can provide information on the intensity or the duration of some intellectual epidemics .",
    "qualitative research is all about exploring issues , understanding phenomena , and answering questions @xcite without much mathematics .",
    "qualitative research involves empirical research through which the researcher explores relationships using a textual methodology rather than quantitative data .",
    "problems and results in the field of qualitative research on knowledge epidemics will not be discussed in detail here . however , through one example it can be shown how mathematics can create the basis for qualitative research and decision making .",
    "this example is connected to the science landscape concepts outlined here below .",
    "the idea of science landscapes has some similarity with the work of wright @xcite in biology who proposed that the fitness landscape evolution can be treated as as optimization process based on the roles of mutation , inbreeding , crossbreeding , and selection .",
    "the science landscape idea was developed by small @xcite , as well as by noyons and van raan @xcite . in this framework , scharnhorst @xcite proposed an approach for the analysis of scientific landscapes , named `` geometrically oriented evolution theory '' .",
    "+    as an illustration at this level , consider that a mathematical example of a technological landscape can be given by a function @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the cost for developing a new airplane , and where @xmath2 and @xmath3 represent the size and velocity of the airplane .",
    "consider two examples concerning the use of science landscapes for evaluation purposes :    * ( 1 ) science landscape approach as a method for evaluating national research strategies *    for example , national science systems can be considered as made of researchers who compete for scientific results , and subsidies , following optimal research strategies .",
    "the efforts of every country become visible , comparable and measurable by means of appropriate functions or landscapes : e.g. , the number of publications .",
    "the aggregate research strategies of a country can thereby be represented by the distribution of publications in the various scientific disciplines . in so doing , within a two - dimensional space ,",
    "different countries correspond to different landscapes .",
    "various political discussions can follow and evolution strategies can be invented thereafter .",
    "notice that the dynamics of self - organized structures in complex systems can be understood as the result of a search for optimal solutions to a certain problem .",
    "therefore , such a comment shows how rather strict mathematical approaches , not disregarding simulation methods , can be congruent to qualitative questions .    *",
    "( 2 ) scientific citations as landscapes for individual evaluation * + scientific citations can serve for constructing landscapes .",
    "indeed , citations have a key position in the retrieval and valuation of information in scientific communication systems @xcite .",
    "this position is based on the objective nature of the citations as components of a global information system , as represented by the science citation index . a landscape function based on citations",
    "can be defined in various ways .",
    "it can take into account self - citations @xcite , or time - dependent quantitative measures @xcite .",
    "+      alfred lotka , one of the modern founders of population dynamics studies , was also an excellent statistician .",
    "he discovered @xcite a distribution for the number of authors @xmath4 as a function of the number of published papers @xmath5 , - i.e. , @xmath6 .",
    "however , derek price , a physicist , set the mathematical basis in the field of measuring scientific research in recent times @xcite .",
    "he proposed a model of scientific growth connecting science and time . in the first version of the model , the size of science",
    "was measured by the number of journals founded in the course of a number of years .",
    "later , instead of the number of journals , the number of published papers was used as the measure of scientific growth .",
    "price and other authors @xcite considered also different indicators of scientific growth , such as the number of authors , funds , dissertation production , citations , or the number of scientific books .",
    "in addition to the deterministic approach initiated by price , the statistical approach to the study of scientific information developed rapidly and nowadays is still an important tool in scientometrics @xcite .",
    "more discussion on the statistical approach will be given in section 6 of this chapter .",
    "+          population dynamics is the branch of life sciences that studies short- and long - term changes in the size and age composition of populations , and how the biological and environmental processes influence those changes . in the past ,",
    "most models for biological population dynamics have been of interest only in mathematical biology @xcite .",
    "today , these models are adapted and applied in many more areas of science @xcite .",
    "here below , models of knowledge dynamics will be of interest as bases of epidemic models .",
    "such models are nowadays used because some stages of idea spreading processes within a population ( e.g , of scientists ) , possess properties like those of epidemics .",
    "the mathematical modeling of epidemic processes has attracted much attention since the spread of infectious diseases has always been of great concern and considered to be a threat to public health @xcite . in the history of science and society ,",
    "many examples of ideas spreading seem to occur in a way similar to the spread of epidemics .",
    "examples of the former field pertain to the ideas of newton on mechanics and the passion for `` high critical temperature superconductivity '' at the end of the twentieh century .",
    "examples of the latter field are the spreading of ideas from moses or buddha @xcite , or discussions based on the kermack - mckendrick model @xcite for the epidemic stages of revolutions or drug spreading @xcite .",
    "epidemic models belong to a more general class of lotka - volterra models used in research on systems in the fields of biological population dynamics , social dynamics , and economics .",
    "the models can also be used for describing processes connected to the spread of knowledge , ideas and innovations ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . two examples are the model of innovation in established organizations @xcite and the lotka - volterra model for forecasting emerging technologies and the growth of knowledge @xcite . in social dynamics , the lanchester model of war between two armies can be mentioned , a model which in the case of reinforcements coincides with the lotka - volterra - gause model for competition between two species @xcite .",
    "solomon and richmond @xcite applied a lotka - volterra model to financial markets , while the model for the trap of extinction can be applied to economic subjects @xcite .",
    "applications to chaotic pairwise competition among political parties @xcite could also be mentioned .        to start the discussion of population dynamics models as applied to the growth of scientific knowledge with special emphasis on epidemic models , two kinds of models can be discussed ( fig .",
    "2 ) : * ( 1 ) deterministic models * , see sec . 3 , appropriate for large and small populations where the fluctuations are not drastically important , * ( 2 ) stochastic models * , see sec . 4 , appropriate for small populations",
    "in the latter case the intrinsic randomness appears much more relevant than in the former case .",
    "stochastic models for large populations will not be discussed .",
    "the reason for this is that such models usually consist of many stochastic differential equations , whence their evolution can be investigated only numerically .",
    "finally , let us mention that the knowledge diffusion is closely connected to the structure and properties of the social network where the diffusion happens .",
    "this is a new and very promising research area .",
    "for example , a combination can be made between the theory of information diffusion and the theory of complex networks @xcite . for more information about the relation between networks and knowledge ,",
    "see the following chapters of the book .",
    "below , 13 selected deterministic models ( see fig .",
    "3 ) are discussed .",
    "the emphasis is on models that can be used for describing the epidemic stage of the diffusion of ideas , knowledge , and technologies .      in a number of cases ,",
    "the natural growth of autonomous systems in competition can be described by the logistic equation and the logistic curve ( s - curve ) @xcite . in order to describe trajectories of growth or decline in socio - technical systems",
    ", one generally applies a three - parameter logistic curve : @xmath7}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the number of units in the species or growing variable to study ; @xmath9 is the asymptotic limit of growth ; @xmath10 is the growth rate which specifies the `` width '' of the s - curve for @xmath8 ; and @xmath11 specifies the time @xmath12 when the curve reaches the midpoint of the growth trajectory , such that @xmath13 .",
    "the three parameters , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , are usually obtained after fitting some data @xcite .",
    "it is well known that many cases of epidemic growth can be described by parts of an appropriate s - curve . as an example , recall that the s - curve was also used for describing technological substitution @xcite , @xmath14 60 years ago .",
    "however , different interaction schemes can generate different growth patterns for whatever system species are under consideration @xcite .",
    "not every interaction scheme leads to a logistic growth @xcite .",
    "the evolution of systems in such regimes may be described by more complex curves , such as a combination of two or more simple three - parameter functions @xcite .",
    "as recalled here above , the simplest epidemic models could be used for describing technology diffusion , like considering two populations / species : adopters and non - adopters of some technology .",
    "such models can be put into two basic classes : either broadcasting ( fig .",
    "4 ) or word - of - mouth models ( fig . 5 ) . in the broadcasting models ,",
    "the source of knowledge about the existence and/or characteristics of the new technology is external and reaches all possible adopters in the same way . in the word - of - mouth models ,",
    "the knowledge is diffused by means of personal interactions .    *",
    "( 1 ) the broadcasting model ( fig .",

    "a basic limitation in most models of innovation diffusion has been the assumption of instantaneous acceptance of the new innovation by a potential adopter @xcite .",

    "price considered the exponential growth as a disease that retards the growth of stable science , producing narrower and less flexible specialists .",
    "+    the unreserved application of the price model faces several difficulties :    * many scientific products which seem to be new are not really new ; * creativity and innovation can be confused @xcite ; * creative papers with new ideas and results have the same importance as trivial duplications @xcite ; * two things are omitted : * * quality ( whatever that means , but it is an economic notion ) of research ; * * the cost or measure of complexity .    in answer to this , price formulated the hypothesis that one should be studying only the growth of * important * discoveries , inventions , and scientific laws , rather than both important and trivial things .",
    "in so doing , one might expect that any of such studied growth will follow the same pattern .",
    "a generalized version of the price model for the growth of a scientific field @xcite is based on the following assumptions : * ( a ) * the growth is measured by the number of important publications appearing at a given time ; * ( b ) * the growth has a continuous character , though a finite time period @xmath48 is needed to build up a result of the fundamental character ; * ( c ) * the interactions between various scientific fields are neglected .",

    "lotka was its pioneer ; a large amount of research has followed . just as examples",

    "shall receive some special attention ( see fig .",
    "24 ) .    as part of this discussion on the statistical approach",
    ", the analysis of the productivity of scientists can be considered .",
    "the information connected to new ideas is thought to be often codified in scientific papers .",
    "thus , the statistical aspects of scientific productivity is of practical importance .",
    "for example , the lotka law reflects the distribution of publications over the set of authors considered as the information sources .",
    "bradford law describes the distribution of papers on a given topic over the set of journals publishing these papers and ranked according to the order in the decrease of the number of papers on a given topic in each journal .",
    "these laws have a non - gaussian nature and , because of this , possess specific features such as a concentration and dispersal effect @xcite : for example , it is found that there is a small number of highly productive scientists who write most of the papers on a given topic and , on the other hand , a large number of scientists with low productivity .    in order to give an example of the connection between the deterministic and statistical approaches , remember that the goffman - newill model , discussed here above , presents a connection between the number of scientists working in a research area and the number of relevant publications . in @xcite , it was found that the number of new publications scale as a simple power law with the corresponding number of new authors : @xmath341 where @xmath342 and @xmath343 are the new publications and the new authors over some time period ( for an example one year ) .",
    "@xmath1 is a normalization constant , and @xmath10 is a scaling exponent",
    ". it has been demonstrated @xcite that the latter relationship provides a very good fit to data for six different research fields , but with different values of the scaling exponent @xmath10 . for @xmath344 , a field would grow by showing an increase in the number of publications per capita , i.e. , in such a research field , the individual productivity increases as the field attracts new scientists .",
    "a field with @xmath345 has a per capita decrease in productivity .",
    "this can be a warning signal for a dying subject matter .",
    "it would be interesting to observe whether the exponent @xmath10 is time - dependent , as is the case in related characterizing scaling exponents of financial markets @xcite or in meteorology@xcite .",
    "policy control can thus be implemented for shaking @xmath10 , thus the field mobility .",
    "+      pareto @xcite formulated the 80/20 rule : it can be expected that 20% of people will have 80% of the wealth . or it can be expected that 80% of the citations refer to a core of 20% of the titles in journals .",
    "the idea of the rule of pareto is very close to the research of lotka who noticed the following dependence for the number of scientists @xmath346 who wrote @xmath274 papers @xmath347 in eq.([lotka2 ] ) , @xmath348 is the number of scientists who wrote just one paper and @xmath349 is the maximal productivity of a scientist .",
    "@xmath350 where @xmath83 is the total number of scientists .",
    "if we assume that @xmath351 and take into account the fact that @xmath352 , we obtain a limiting value for the portion of scientists with the minimal productivity ( single paper authors ) in the given population of authors : @xmath353 .",
    "then , if the left and the right hand sides of eq.([lotka2 ] ) are divided by n , the frequency expression for the productivity distribution is : @xmath354 ; @xmath355 . eq .",
    "( [ lotka2 ] ) is called lotka law , or the law of inverse squares : the number of scientists who wrote a given number of papers is inversely proportional to the square of this number of papers .",
    "it must be noted that , like many other statistical regularities , lotka law is valid only on the average since the exponent in the denominator of eq.([lotka2 ] ) is not necessarily equal to two @xcite .",
    "thus , lotka law should be considered as the most typical among a more general family of distributions : @xmath356 where @xmath10 is the characteristic exponent of the distribution , @xmath348 is the normalizing coefficient which is determined as follows : @xmath357 then the distribution of scientific output , eq.([lotka3 ] ) , is determined by three parameters : the proportion of scientists with the minimal productivity @xmath358 , the maximal productivity of a scientist @xmath349 , and the characteristic exponent @xmath10 . if one of these parameters is fixed , it is possible to study the dependence between two others .",
    "let us fix @xmath349 in eq.([lotka4 ] ) .",
    "then , we obtain the proportion of `` single paper authors '' @xmath358 as a function of @xmath10 : @xmath359 . when eq.([lotka4 ] ) is differentiated with respect to @xmath10",
    ", one can show that the corresponding derivative is positive for any @xmath10 : @xmath360 . on the basis of a similar analysis of the portion of scientists with a larger productivity @xmath361 as a function of @xmath10 ,",
    "we arrive at the conclusion : * the increase of @xmath10 is accompanied by the increase of low - productivity scientists*. this means that when the total number of scientists is preserved the portion of highly productive scientists will decrease .",
    "let us show that the lotka law is an asymptotic expression for the yule distribution .",
    "in order to obtain the yule distribution , one considers the process of formation of a collection of publications as a markov - type stochastic process .",
    "in addition , it is assumed that the probability of writing a new paper depends on the number of papers that have been already written by the scientist at time @xmath15 : the probability of the transition into a new state on the interval @xmath362 $ ] should be a function of the state in which the system is at time @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , the probability of publishing a new paper during a time interval @xmath363 is assumed to be proportional to the number @xmath155 of papers that have been written by the scientists , introducing an intensity coefficient @xmath84 : @xmath364 . after solving the corresponding system of differential equations for this process , the following expression ( the yule distribution ) for the probability @xmath365 of a scientist writing @xmath155 papers during a time @xmath15",
    "is obtained @xcite : @xmath366 the mean value of the yule distribution is @xmath367 .",
    "let us take into account the fact that every scientist works on a given subject during a certain finite random time interval @xmath368 $ ] which depends on the scientist s creative potential , the conditions for work , etc . with the simplest assumption that the probability of discontinuing work on a given subject is constant at any time , one obtains an exponential distribution for the time of work of any author in the scientific field under study : @xmath369 , where @xmath33 is the distribution parameter .",
    "the time parameter @xmath15 which characterizes the productivity distribution , eq.([yule1 ] ) , is a random number .",
    "then in order to obtain the final distribution of scientific output observed in the experiment over sufficiently large time intervals , eq.([yule1 ] ) should be averaged with respect to this parameter @xmath15 which is distributed according to the exponential law : @xmath370 after integrating eq.([yule2 ] ) , the distribution of scientific output reads @xmath371 where @xmath372 is a beta - function , @xmath373 is a gamma - function , and @xmath374 is the characteristic exponent .",
    "for instance , if @xmath375 then @xmath376 $ ] .",
    "let us assume that @xmath377 and apply the stirling formula .",
    "thus , the asymptotics of the yule distribution eq.([yule3 ] ) is like lotka law eq.([lotka3 ] ) ( up to a normalizing constant ) : @xmath378 .      for large enough values of the total number of scientists and the total number of publications",
    ", we can make the transition from discrete to continuous representation of the corresponding variables and laws .",
    "the continuous analog of lotka law , eq .",
    "( [ lotka3 ] ) , is the pareto distribution @xmath379 which describes the distribution density for a number of scientists with @xmath155 papers ; @xmath380 is the minimal productivity @xmath381 , a continuous quantity .",
    "zipf law is connected to the principle of least effort @xcite : a person will try to solve his problems in such a way as to minimize the total work that he must do in the solution process .",
    "for example , to express with many words what can be expressed with a few is meaningless .",
    "thus , it is important to summarize an article using a small number of meaningful words .",
    "bradford law for the scattering of articles over different journals is connected to the success - breeds - success ( sbs ) principle @xcite : success in the past increases chances for some success in the future .",
    "for example , a journal that has been frequently consulted for some purpose is more likely to be read again , rather than one of previously infrequent use .    in order to obtain the law of zipf - mandelbrot ,",
    "we start from the following version of lotka law : @xmath382 , where @xmath155 is the scientist s productivity , @xmath10 is a characteristic exponent , @xmath1 is a constant which in most cases is equal to the number of authors with the minimal productivity @xmath383 , i.e. , to @xmath348 .",
    "on the basis of this formula , the number of scientists @xmath5 who are characterized by productivity @xmath384 ( @xmath349 is the maximal productivity of a scientist ) reads @xmath385 depending on the value of @xmath386 , @xmath5 can have values @xmath387 and in such a way the scientists can be ranked . if all scientists of a scientific community working on the same topic are ranked in the order of the decrease of their productivity , the place of a scientist who has written @xmath386 papers will be determined by his / her rank @xmath5 . when the productivity of a scientist @xmath386 is found from eq.([yule5 ] ) as a function of rank @xmath5 , the relationship @xmath388 this is the rank law of zipf - mandelbrot , which generalizes zipf law : @xmath389 , where @xmath109 and @xmath11 are parameters .",
    "zipf law was discovered by counting words in books .",
    "if words in a book are ranked in decreasing order according to their number of occurrences , then zipf law states that the number of occurrences of a word is inversely proportional to its rank @xmath5 .    assuming that in lotka law the exponent takes the value @xmath390 and that in most cases @xmath391 , one has @xmath392 , where @xmath393 , @xmath394 .",
    "integration of the last relationship yields the total productivity @xmath395 of all scientists , beginning with the one with the greatest productivity @xmath349 and ending with the scientist whose productivity corresponds to the rank @xmath146 ( the scientists are ranked in the order of diminishing productivity ; the rank is assumed to be a continuous - like variable ) : @xmath396 this is bradford law . according to this law , for a given topic , a large number of relevant articles will be concentrated in a small number of journals .",
    "the remaining articles will be dispersed over a large number of journals .",
    "thus , if scientific journals are arranged in order of decreasing published articles on a given subject , they may be split to a core of journals more particularly devoted to the subject and a shell consisting of sub - shells of journals containing the same numbers of articles as the core .",
    "then the number of journals from the core zone and succeeding sub - shells will follow the relationship @xmath397 .",
