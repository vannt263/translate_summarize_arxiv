    "the concept of matter - wave absorption often proves valuable in modeling irreversible escape or leakage of a quantum wave function from a practically `` interesting '' part of the system s hilbert space into the complementary , `` uninteresting '' part .",
    "a representative example is an inelastic atomic ( or molecular ) collision process , in which a colliding atom may end up ionized ( or a molecule dissociated ) , thus becoming invisible for a detector .",
    "an analytical or numerical description of such a process may be significantly simplified by restricting the full wave function to a subspace of detectable states , and mimicking its coupling to the complementary subspace of undetectable ( ionized or dissociated ) states by endowing the system s hamiltonian with such nonhermitian features as absorbing complex potentials  @xcite or absorbing boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "the present study is devoted to a problem of the motion of a one - dimensional quantum particle in the presence of a point - like absorber whose absorbing properties change in the course of time . on a practical side , this problem models for instance a passage of an atom through a partially ionizing laser light sheet of time - dependent intensity . on a more fundamental level ,",
    "the problem is a generalization of the celebrated moshinsky shutter problem  @xcite , which is a paradigm of the theory of quantum transients  @xcite .",
    "as first shown by moshinsky , a sudden removal of a completely absorbing point - like barrier may give rise to well - pronounced oscillations of the amplitude of the particle s wave function , and the mathematical structure of these oscillations is closely analogous to that of intensity fringes observed in optical diffraction of light at apertures with straight edges .",
    "this temporal quantum phenomenon is commonly referred to as `` diffraction in time '' .",
    "in addition to its purely theoretical interest , diffraction in time has been at the heart of many experimental studies @xcite .",
    "here we consider a one - dimensional quantum particle characterized by a wave function @xmath1 , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 denoting the spatial coordinate and time respectively .",
    "as we will be dealing with an absorbing system , the norm of the wave function may generally be smaller than unity , i.e. , @xmath4 is normalized to unity , @xmath5 , and is spatially localized , for the concreteness , to the left of the origin , so that @xmath6 for all @xmath7 .",
    "we further imagine that a point - like barrier is positioned at @xmath8 ; the barrier is such that it partly absorbs matter waves passing through it , and that the proportion of the amount absorbed to the amount transmitted depends on time @xmath3 .",
    "( below we will present a more concrete definition of the absorption process . )",
    "the central aim of the present work is to compare two different approaches that allow one to evaluate the particle s wave function @xmath1 in the transmission region , @xmath9 , at time @xmath10 .",
    "the first approach , which we will refer to as the aperture function model ( afm ) , was originally devised in refs .  @xcite .",
    "it is based on modeling the absorbing barrier by means of discontinuous time - dependent boundary conditions at @xmath11 , connecting the values of the wave function and its spatial derivative across the barrier .",
    "the main strength of the afm is that it is exactly solvable  @xcite .",
    "this quality of the model allows for accurate and essentially analytical evaluation of the part of the wave function transmitted through the barrier .",
    "in particular , the afm has been recently used to advance absorption - based displacement , splitting , squeezing , and cooling of atomic wave packets @xcite .",
    "an apparent weakness of the afm however is the absence of a first - principle derivation of the absorbing boundary conditions .",
    "this is why a careful comparison between the afm and some first - principle model of time - dependent absorption is much needed .",
    "the second approach to the problem , termed here the delta potential model ( dpm ) , is a time - dependent extension of an atom - laser system studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this model ,",
    "the moving particle is a two - level atom , with the internal states labelled @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the atom is regarded as detectable ( visible ) if it is in the internal state @xmath12 , and undetectable ( invisible or absorbed ) if it is in @xmath13 .",
    "initially , the atom is detectable , and its total state is the product state @xmath14 .",
    "in the course of its motion , the atom interacts with a time - dependent off - diagonal @xmath0-potential , representing an absorbing barrier , whose role is to mix populations of the internal states @xmath12 and @xmath13 . as a result of this interaction , the total state of the atom at time @xmath10",
    "will generally be a linear combination of the two internal states .",
    "it is the projection on @xmath12 that determines the part of the wave function that has not been absorbed by the barrier .",
    "an important advantage of the dpm over the afm is that the former has a solid first - principle justification .",
    "its main disadvantage however is that , except for few special cases , the dpm does not admit analytical treatment , and the transmitted wave function has to be computed numerically .    in this paper",
    "we make a comparison between the afm and dpm .",
    "we show that in the semiclassical ( short - wavelength ) regime the two models agree in their predictions of the wave function transmitted through the barrier . in an atom - optics setting ,",
    "this semiclassical regime is of special importance as it covers a wide range of experimentally relevant parameters .",
    "outside the semiclassical regime however we generally find quantitative discrepancies between the predictions of the two models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] , we give a detailed definition of the two models of absorption , the afm and dpm , and hypothesize about a connection between them .",

    "some technical details are deferred to an appendix .",
    "in this section we define , in full detail , two mathematical models describing the motion of a non - relativistic quantum particle in the presence of a time - dependent absorbing barrier , and outline our strategy for making a comparison between them .",
    "we start by summarizing the afm , originally developed in refs .  @xcite . as specified in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , we consider a quantum particle initially described by a wave function @xmath15 , which is assumed to be entirely localized on the half - line @xmath16 .",

    "the real - valued function @xmath28 is the aperture function of the barrier , and is defined in the following way .",
    "the values of @xmath29 range between 0 and 1 , with 0 representing the situation when the barrier absorbs entirely all incident matter waves ( completely absorbing , nontransparent barrier ) and 1 corresponding to the unobstructed , free - particle motion ( perfectly transparent barrier ) .",
    "more generally , @xmath30 is taken to be an instantaneous ( pertinent to the barrier at time @xmath25 ) transmission probability defined with respect to the initial state @xmath15 .",

    "the amplitude of a particle s passage from a point @xmath36 to a point @xmath9 in time @xmath3 is determined by a superposition of a continuous family of paths parametrized by @xmath25 .",
    "each of these paths consists of ( i ) a free flight from @xmath37 to the barrier in time @xmath25 , ( ii ) a modulation of the amplitude by a factor proportional to the aperture function @xmath28 and the mean velocity @xmath38 at which the particle crosses the barrier , and ( iii ) another free flight from the barrier to @xmath2 in the remaining time @xmath39 .    finally , we note that the afm is conceptually similar to other analytical approaches devised to describe the wave function transmission through real , reflecting time - dependent barriers ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "@xcite . ) here we formulate an extended version of the point - like atom - laser interaction model in which the intensity of the @xmath0-laser is allowed to change in time in accordance with an externally prescribed protocol .    to this end",
    ", we consider a two level atom , with the internal states labelled @xmath12 and @xmath13 . at any time @xmath25",
    ", the full state of the atom can be written as @xmath40 , with @xmath41 and @xmath42 representing the spatial parts of the state . the atom is initially prepared in the state defined by @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in the course of its time evolution , the atom propagates freely everywhere in space except for the point @xmath8 , at which a barrier is placed .",
    "the barrier is represented by an off - diagonal @xmath0-potential with a time - dependent amplitude , @xmath45 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath46 is a positive - valued function of time quantifying the strength of the atom - laser coupling and directly proportional to the square root of the laser intensity .",
    "so , the time evolution of the full atomic state is governed by the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath47 for @xmath20 , where @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 in addition , the full wave function is subject to the usual dirichlet boundary conditions at infinity , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    in the context of the dpm ,",
    "the internal state @xmath53 represents detectable particles , and @xmath54 labels particles absorbed by the barrier .",
    "thus , the atom that at time @xmath3 has traversed the barrier and remained in its original internal state @xmath53 , or , in other words , the particle that has survived the absorbing barrier , is described by the wave function @xmath55 the wave function @xmath56 admits analytical evaluation only in very few special cases .",

    "we numerically evaluate the fidelity , @xmath285 , and probability ratio , @xmath286 , in four atom - barrier systems that differ from each other only by the mass of the atom .",
