    "the value of combining x - ray and infrared observations in the search for massive stars in the galactic center has recently been demonstrated with the discovery of luminous , emission - line star counterparts ( @xmath3 ) to x - ray sources within a projected distance of 30 pc from sgr a*. ( muno et al .",
    "2006b , mikles et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the objects found may either be massive wolf - rayet ( wr)/o stars in colliding - wind binaries ( cwbs ) , accreting neutron stars and black holes in high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , or extraordinary isolated massive stars .",
    "the search for objects such as these in the galactic center is important for the following reasons .",
    "a more complete census of the massive stellar population is crucial in understanding the mode of star formation in the galactic center , where adverse environmental conditions such as turbulent molecular clouds , milligauss magnetic fields and strong tidal forces may result in a relatively large jeans mass for collapsing cloud cores ( morris 1993 , morris & serabyn 1996 ) .",
    "it is unknown if these conditions result predominantly in the formation of rich clusters of massive stars such as the arches and quintuplet , which are among the most dense and massive clusters known in the entire galaxy ( figer et al .",
    "clusters such as these will be subject to the strong tidal forces of the galactic center , and as a result will dissipate and fade from view into the dense field population of cool giants within @xmath410 myr ( kim , morris & lee 1999 ; portegies - zwart et al . 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "thus , x - rays emitted by a subset of massive stars may act as a guide toward the location of such clusters .    of additional importance",
    "is understanding what fraction of the x - ray population currently detected within 300 pc of galactic center by the is composed of hmxbs .",
    "the inner 300 pc of the galaxy contains 1% of the galactic stellar mass ( launhardt , zylka & mezger 2002 ) , and so provides a statistically meaningful sample of compact objects .",
    "if star formation in the galactic center does produce a higher fraction of massive stars and clusters than in the galactic disk , this may result in the production of a population of galactic center hmxbs , in excess of the number predicted to exist from population synthesis models ( pfahl , rappaport & podsiadlowski 2002 ) .",
    "these models are based upon uncertain assumptions about the angular momentum lost during the common - envelope phase , and the kicks imparted to compact objects at birth in supernovae .",
    "the detectability of hmxbs is dependent on the physics of x - ray production at the low accretion rates expected to persist in the majority of these systems , where the effect of magnetic fields in controlling the accretion flow is uncertain ( ikhsanov 2001 , liu & li 2006 ) .",
    "therefore , a comparison of numbers with the recent star formation history of the galactic center will allow a constraint on models of hmxb formation , evolution and x - ray production .",
    "recently , muno et al ( 2006a ) produced a new catalog of galactic center x - ray sources .",
    "in addition to the existing shallow catalog of the inner 2@xmath5@xmath60.8@xmath5 ( wang et al .",
    "2002 , muno et al .",
    "2003 ) , the new deeper observations of the radio arches region reveal an excess of bright x - ray sources over the general population of old cataclysmic variables . although the number of hmxbs contributing to the original x - ray population of muno et al . ( 2003 ) has been constrained to @xmath710% ( laycock et al . 2005 ) , it remains unknown what fraction of the current complete catalog of @xmath84000 x - ray sources consists of massive wr / o stars and hmxbs .",
    "we present here new results of our ir spectroscopy campaign to identify counterparts to the x - ray population .",
    "two massive stellar counterparts to @xmath9 x - ray sources have been discovered .",
    "also , an examination of archival 8 @xmath1 maps of the galactic center from @xmath2 reveals interesting warm - dust structures , most likely heated and sculpted by the winds and radiation of hot stars .",
    "a careful examination of warm dust morphology can lead to the discovery of additional massive stars , as evidenced by our discovery of a b2 ia supergiant . in this paper , we present @xmath0-band spectra of new massive stars , and discuss their possible origins .",
    "we cross - correlated the positions of infrared stars from the _ two - micron all - sky survey _ ( 2mass ) with x - ray point - source positions from @xmath9 observations of two 17@xmath617@xmath10 fields in the galactic center , which consisted of a @xmath450 ks observation centered on the radio arches region ( muno et al 2006a ) , and a @xmath4100 ks observation centered on the arches cluster ( wang et al .",
    "a search radius of 1@xmath10 was used for the cross correlation , equivalent to the 1@xmath10 positional error circle of @xmath9 point sources .",
    "the x - ray data allowed the detection of galactic center sources as faint as @xmath11 erg s@xmath12 , five times deeper than the shallow galactic center survey of wang et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . to further discriminate foreground sources",
    ", we limited our sample of candidate ir counterparts to those sources having very red ir colors ( _ h@xmath13_@xmath81.3 ) , and x - ray colors indicative of an absorption column of gas and dust having @xmath14 @xmath15 ( see muno et al .",
    "we have assembled a catalog of 35 x - ray sources having bright infrared counterparts ( @xmath16 ) that is likely to contain a number of wr / o stars and hmxbs .",
    "chandra_/2mass cross - correlation , comparing the results of analysis on astrometrically - aligned catalogs with that of randomly offset catalogs , indicates that the number of x - ray / ir matches is in excess of that expected from random chance alone by @xmath430% .",
    "this is not surprising since the radio arches region is a known site of active star formation ( cotera et al .",
    "1999 ; figer et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we also examined archival images from the mid - ir survey of the galactic center with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "( stolovy et al . 2006 ) in the vicinity of the known massive x - ray - emitting star cxogc j174515.1 - 290315 ( hereafter x174515.1 - muno et al .",
    "we identified a candidate massive star near the center of curvature of a shell of 8 @xmath1 emission , shown in figure 2 , which we name sstu j174523.1290329 , in accordance with the iau naming convention for unregistered @xmath2 sources .",
    "archival @xmath9 observations of fields containing sgr a * , totaling nearly 1 msec of exposure time obtained over the course of 6 years , were used to search for an x - ray counterpart to sstu j174523.1290329 .",

    ", we began @xmath0-band grism spectroscopy of our candidate sample with the keck ii telescope and nirc2 instrument in conjunction with adaptive - optics ( ao ) .",
    "we used the wide camera setting ( 004 pix@xmath12 ) and the medium resolution grism with a 006 slit , resulting in an effective spectral resolution of @xmath17@xmath42200 ( @xmath470 km s@xmath12 ) .",
    "we observed the a1v standard star hd 19550 at the end of our observations for telluric correction .",
    "the hi br@xmath18 feature in the a - star spectrum was removed by interpolating the continuum over the line before telluric division .",
    "the @xmath0-band spectra of argon and xenon dome lamps were used for wavelength calibration .",
    "@xmath0-band spectra of a total of 6 x - ray / ir matches were obtained , and 2 of them were found to be hot emission - line stars coincident with @xmath9 sources cxogc j174555.3 - 285126 and cxogc j174617.0 - 285131 .",
    "the other 4 sources exhibited co bandheads at @xmath19 , typical of the field population of cool giants and foreground dwarfs . due to the extreme rarity of emission - line stars",
    "relative to the late - type field population , we assume that the emission - line stars represent the true ir counterpart to the x - ray source .",
    "in addition to the @xmath0-band spectra of the 2mass counterparts to @xmath9 sources , a @xmath20-band spectrum of sstu j174523.1290329 and an image of the field were obtained .",
    "the results of spectroscopy are presented in the following section .",
    "the basic infrared and x - ray photometric properties of our candidates are given in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath0-band spectrum of cxogc j174555.3@xmath21285126 ( hereafter x174555.3 ) exhibits very broad emission lines of hei and heii , indicative of a classical wr star ( evolved helium - burning star ) with high - velocity winds .",
    "figure 1 ( left panel ) illustrates the strong similarity of the x174555.3 @xmath0-band spectrum to that of the central parsec cluster star irs16se2 ( horrobin et al .",
    "2004 , martins et al . 2006 ) and the star wr134 , both of which have been classified as early- nitrogen - type wr stars ( wne ) of sub - type wn5 - 6 and wn6 , respectively .",
    "in addition to the spectral comparison in figure 1 , the sub - type of x174555.3 can also be estimated as wn5 - 6 on the basis of the equivalent width ( ew ) ratios of the heii and hei lines , having ew@xmath22/ew@xmath23  @xmath4  2 - 4 and ew@xmath22/ew@xmath24  @xmath4  1 - 2 ( see figer , mcclean & najarro 1997 ( fmn97 )  their figure 1 ) .",
    "the ew measurements for x174555.3 are given in table 2 along with the published values for the comparison star wr134 .",

    "the wn6 star wr134 has fwhm ( 2.189  @xmath1 )  =  175   , reported in fmn97 , and is thus given the broad designation in van der hucht ( 2001 ) . by the comparison of wr134 with x174555.3 in figure 1 ,",
    "it is clear that the latter has the broadest 2.189 @xmath1 line . in conclusion ,",
    "we classify x174555.3 as a wn6b star .",
    "the @xmath0-band spectrum of cxogc j174617.0@xmath21285131 ( hereafter x174617.0 ) exhibits br@xmath18 and he i emission lines as well as the cno product niii .",

    "1996 ) , since the spectra of bonafide wr stars must exhibit heii in either pure emission or p cygni .",
    "both hd 152386 and wr 108 show a p cygni feature at 2.189 @xmath1 , while hd 153919 and x174617.0 only show evidence of absorption at his wavelength .",
    "furthermore , the wn9 ha stars show evidence for hei 2.058 @xmath1 p cygni profiles , whereas x174617.0 and the o6.5 iaf@xmath26 star hd 153919 do not show any convincing evidence of this transition . therefore we classify x174617.0 as an o ia star .",
    "figure 3 shows a @xmath20 ao image of sstu j174523.1290329 ( hereafter s174523.1 ) .",
    "since there was initial confusion as to which of the 2 bright stars may be responsible for the morphology of the surrounding 8 @xmath1 emission , we obtained @xmath20-band spectra of both of them . in figure 4 , the @xmath20-band spectrum of the fainter star ( @xmath0=10.3 ) exhibits absorption lines of br@xmath18 and hei as well as a hei emission line at 2.058 @xmath1 , bearing close resemblance to the b2 ia supergiant hd134959 ( hanson et al . 2005 ) .",
    "in addition to the hei 2.058 @xmath1 emission line ( only present in hot supergiants ) , the supergiant status of this star is further evidenced by the fact that the br@xmath18 and hei 2.161 @xmath1 lines are not blended , in contrast to b main - sequence stars , where their smaller radius results in a more rapidly rotating star with rotationally broadened br@xmath18 lines .",
    "the brighter nearby star ( @xmath0=8.7 , spectrum not presented here ) exhibits co bandheads , indicative of a late - type star , perhaps a red supergiant .",
    "due to our use of a @xmath20 filter for this particular observation , we lack the spectral coverage necessary at @xmath27@xmath82.28 @xmath1 to analyze the co bandhead in sufficient detail to aid in determining supergiant status , although the photometry to follow in  3.2 , and the assumption of galactic center distance , do indicate that this is a red supergiant .",

    "neither x174555.3 nor x174627.0 were detected in the soft x - ray band ( 0.52.0 kev ) , indicating that these sources are highly absorbed by gas and dust , as is expected for objects located near the galactic center .",
    "the soft color hr0=@xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the respective fluxes in the 2.0 - 3.3 kev and 0.52.0 kev bands , is therefore limited to hr0@xmath37 and hr0@xmath38 for x174555.3 and x174617.0 , respectively .",

    "the values of the ks statistic had at least a 10% chance of being caused by random fluctuations .",
    "we conclude that neither source varied by more than a factor of 2 .",
    "the x - ray and bolometric luminosities of x174555.3 and x174617.0 listed in table 4 are consistent with the @xmath43 relation exhibited by both single o stars ( skinner et al .",
    "2006a ) as well as the cwbs of the galactic starbursts westerlund 1 ( compare crowther et al .",
    "2006 with skinner et al .",
    "2006b ) and ngc 3603 ( moffat et al .",
    "2002 ) , and the r136 cluster of the 30 doradus region of the large magellanic cloud ( portegies - zwart , pooley & lewin 2002 , hereafter ppl02  see their figure 4 ) .",
    "thus , we can not firmly distinguish between single star and cwb scenarios using x - ray / ir photometry data alone .",
    "however , single stars are not known to be steady sources of hard x - rays and tend to have x - ray spectra dominated by a cool component with @xmath44 kev ( oskinova 2005 ) , while cwbs such as those in crowther et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and ppl02 do exhibit hard x - ray spectra with @xmath45  @xmath8  1 kev temperatures .",
    "therefore , we interpret the 2 kev x - ray temperature of x174555.3 and x174617.0 as a strong indication of colliding - wind binarity .    although far less common , it is also possible that the x - ray emission of these stars arises from a wind accreting neutron star , which would make them quiescent hmxbs . indeed , very few hmxbs have been observed with @xmath46@xmath710@xmath47 erg s@xmath12 , most likely because of selection effects against finding them .",
    "such low luminosities would require a low accretion rate of material , which may be prevented from reaching the neutron star s surface by a magnetic propeller .",
    "such scenarios have been invoked to explain the quiescent , non - pulsed x - ray emission of several known transient x - ray pulsars in hmxbs , in which case the x - ray emission arises at a magnetospheric boundary in the propeller regime or from deep crustal heating from pycnonuclear reactions during outburst ( campana et al .",
    "1998 , 2002 ) . as stated in  3.2 , it is possible that the x - ray emission of x174555.3 and x174617.0 represents a non - thermal power - law with @xmath40 , consistent with the transient hmxb 4u 0115 + 63 in its quiescent state , which has an observed @xmath48 ( campana et al . 2002 ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "the observations of x174555.3 and x174617.0 are most consistent with a cwb scenario , although low accretion rate hmxb also remains a possible interpretation .",
    "future monitoring of the ir spectra of these sources may reveal periodic velocity variations , like those observed in the wn stars wr 134 ( p=2.3 days ; morel et al .",
    "1999 ) , and ez cma ( p=3.8 days ; skinner , itoh & nagase 1998 ) .",

    "the warm dust morphology in the region surrounding s174523.1 has a shell- or bubble - like appearance , indicative of a strong stellar wind .",

    "2006 ) . assuming a distance of 8 kpc , the estimated radius of the bubble surrounding s174523.1 is @xmath51 pc , with an outer shell thickness of @xmath52 pc .",

    "furthermore , these bubbles typically have @xmath53/@xmath55 , in good agreement with the value of 0.29 for the bubble surrounding s174523.1 .    the massive ofpe / lbv x - ray star cxogc j174515.1 - 290315 ( hereafter x174515.1 ) reported by muno et al . ( 2006b ) lies 1.5@xmath56 to the west of the b2 ia star",
    ". it is also surrounded by a much smaller shell of material that appears to lie on the same side of x174515.1 as the bubble surrounding s174523.1 , with respect to sgr a*. this may be indicative of shared stellar motion . as described in weaver et al .",
    "( 1977 ) , stellar motion within the ambient ism will produce non - spherical or parabolic bubbles .",
    "a suspicion naturally arises that x174515.1 and s174523.1 could be related , either born of the same molecular cloud or perhaps members of a tidally disrupted stellar cluster ( see  4.3 ) .",
    "identifying more candidate massive stars in this region and obtaining spectra of them should help shed light on this hypothesis .",
    "do the apparently isolated stars in the galactic center have their origins in stellar clusters ?",

    "we refer the reader to this figure to facilitate the following discussion .",
    "note that figure 5 is not meant to illustrate the complete spatial distribution of isolated massive stars in the galactic center due to the numerous selection effects involved in obtaining the current sample .",
    "stellar clusters in the galactic center , such as the arches and quintuplet , will be disrupted by the strong tidal forces there . in the process they will lose stars and decrease in surface density until they fade into the stellar background before @xmath410 myr ( kim , morris & lee 1999 , portegies - zwart et al .",
    "2003 ) . within clusters ,",
    "three - body interactions between binary and single stars can eject single stars with velocities of @xmath57 km s@xmath12 , and impart velocities of @xmath410 km s@xmath12 to the remaining binary , which also may be hardened in the process ( portegies - zwart et al .",
    "2002 , hereafter pz02 ; gualandris , portegies - zwart & eggleton 2004 ) .",
    "the internal velocity dispersion for the arches and quintuplet is roughly an order of magnitude less than their orbital velocity .",
    "therefore stars ejected with @xmath58  10 km s@xmath12 will continue to move more or less along the orbital path of the cluster , maintaining comparable velocities .",
    "in contrast , supernova - induced kicks are expected to produce runaway single stars and binaries with higher velocities ( 50 - 500 km s@xmath12 ) , and with escape trajectories in more random directions than stars that have been dynamically ejected ( van den heuvel et al . 2000 , dray et al .",
    "these processes operating within the arches , quintuplet , or heretofore undiscovered clusters may play an important role in supplementing the inner galaxy with massive stars and binaries , as well as their remnants .",
    "however , simulations of galactic center clusters containing primordial massive binaries have yet to be performed , leaving the details and relative importance of the various ejection processes uncertain .",
    "the two x - ray - emitting stars of this work lie in close proximity to the arches and quintuplet clusters .",
    "x174555.3 ( wn6b ) lies 5.1 pc in projection from the arches and 10.9 pc in projection from the quintuplet , while x174617.0 ( o ia ) lies 14.4 pc in projection from the arches and 4.4 pc in projection from the quintuplet .",
    "the proximity raises the question of whether or not x174555.3 and x174617.0 are escapees from one of the two clusters .",
    "we suspect that x174555.3 and x174617.0 are more likely to be former members of the quintuplet cluster , rather than the arches , for several reasons : 1 ) the quintuplet is older than the arches ( 4@xmath591 vs. 2.5@xmath590.5 myr , respectively ",

    "could the other isolated massive stars in the galactic center also be former members of the arches or quintuplet clusters ? adopting 10 km s@xmath12 as a typical cluster ejection velocity implies that escaped stars could have drifted 25 pc and 40 pc from the arches and quintuplet , respectively .",
    "these distances encompass many of the known isolated emission - line stars of the galactic center , which raises the question of cluster origin . the h1-h8 hii regions ( yusef - zadeh & morris 1987 ; zhao et al .",
    "1993 ; cotera et al 1999 ) could be produced by former arches or quintuplet members simply passing through a particularly dense region of the galactic center ism .",

    "in contrast , the ofpe / wn9 star g0.10 + 0.20 of cotera et al . ( 1999 ) could be an escapee from the arches cluster , as evidenced by its close proximity to the arches ( @xmath41.7 pc in projection ) , and by its near - infrared spectrum which indicates that it has the same evolutionary status as several of the arches members ( f02 ) .",

    "( 2006a ) ( 17@xmath617@xmath10 ) in our search for wr / o stars and hmxbs is a prelude to a more extended effort to find similar objects within the inner 2@xmath5@xmath60.8@xmath5 of the galactic center .",
    "this area is currently being covered in our @xmath9 legacy survey for deep observations of the inner 100 pc of the galaxy , and we plan to continue our ir spectroscopy campaign to search for counterparts .",
    "as more x - ray - emitting massive stars are discovered , ir spectral monitoring could help confirm the presence of companions in suspected cwbs and hmxbs , and constrain their mass functions . furthermore , long - term comparative proper motion studies with adaptive - optics ( ao ) , coupled with radial velocity measurements , could reveal stellar cluster escapees through their space velocity distribution , which may also give information on the energetics of the events that ejected them , and on the tidal field of the galactic center .",
