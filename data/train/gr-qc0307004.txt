    "one of the most striking predictions of einstein s theory of gravity is the occurrence of space - time singularities , i.e. causal geodesic incompleteness , as a generic feature of classical gravitational collapse .",
    "this remarkable conclusion is encapsulated by the singularity theorems of hawking and penrose , who rely for its proof on techniques of differential topology @xcite . in principle",
    ", uncontrollable information may enter the space - time from a singularity and spoil one s ability to predict the future .",
    "that possibility has motived the following conjecture due to r. penrose @xcite :     generically , the classical general theory of relativity would not allow for the creation of locally naked space - time singularities . \"",
    "this statement has been referred to as the _ strong cosmic censorship conjecture _ and none knows whether it is true or false . according to this viewpoint , the internal structure of a generic black - hole is bounded by a singularity that does not lie into the past of any space - time point .",
    "the proviso of generic is necessary since , for instance , the maximal analytical extension of the kerr space - time , which describes an spinning black hole , offers a rich set of possibilities for experience including : close - time like curves , causal trajectories skirting the singularity , and new asymptotically flat regions .",
    "however , this analytic extension can not survive the propagation of small perturbations .",
    "these perturbations are magnified without limit near the cauchy horizon , which is then transformed into a singular barrier that seals the region where predictability is lost .",
    "there are some mathematical results where one does not letjust by handthe initial data develop or evolve outside some restriction on the metric , usually an isometry .",
    "the most complete study of this kind , up today , is the one by isenberg and moncrief on _ polarized gowdy metrics _",
    "@xcite , which are vacuum ( or electrovac ) solutions of einstein s field equations having only two killing vector fields .",
    "remarkably , the strong cosmic censorship conjecture was verified within this restricted space of solutions . in the cauchy - horizon stability approach ,",
    "one must , in contrast , examine every conceivable perturbation to the space - time background which may lead to instability , only restricted by what one should consider physically viable .    before developing a general treatment that includes all the spinning black - holes ,",
    "it is natural to look for clues in charge black - hole space - times since they share certain resemblance with the causal structure of a rotating hole .",
    "let us thus consider more carefully the reissneer - nordstrm solution .",
    "the mathematical analysis on the propagation of small perturbations of _ compact support _ in the reissneer - nordstrm background leads to an _ unbounded _ flux of radiation at the future - cauchy horizon .",
    "the _ _ slowest rate of divergence__which takes the form @xmath0 where the advanced time , @xmath1 goes to plus infinity near the cauchy horizonis controlled by an inequality between the surface gravities , @xmath2 and @xmath3 at the cauchy and future event horizons respectively @xcite .",
    "that is , @xmath4 it seems , however , that the role of the _ surface - gravity inequality _ ( [ universal1 ] ) , is of a more general character beyond the reissnernordstrm geometry .",
    "its relevance arises because , heuristically , the radiation of compact support is not only blue shifted by approaching the cauchy horizon but also redshifted by climbing away from the event horizon @xcite , see fig.[chargebh ] .",
    "mathematically , the form of this divergence follows from the analytical properties of the black hole scattering potential , or potential well , which vanishes at both horizons .",
    "penrose diagram for a charge black - hole illustrating how the scattering of perturbations along the arc @xmath5 will result in an accumulation of wave fronts for the radiation received by an observer crossing the cauchy horizon along the segment @xmath6 .",
    "when the inequality @xmath7 between the surface gravities , @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the cauchy horizon , @xmath8 and future event horizon , @xmath9 is satisfied , the flux of radiation diverges for all physically reasonable perturbations , even including those with _",
    "compact _ support .",
    "this assertion still holds in the presence of a positive cosmological when the space - time is asymptotically de sitter @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10coordinate is defined to be and advanced time which takes the value @xmath11 at @xmath6 and @xmath12 at @xmath13.,width=288 ]    we argue that this universal inequality , ( [ universal1 ] ) , can not be overcome , precisely , because it turns out to be equivalent via einstein s field equations to a _",
    "condition on the source of the gravitational field , which is satisfied by all matter fields obeying some _ energy condition _ and a _ reasonable equation of state _ ( which determines whether the space - time is asymptotically flat or not ) .",
    "let us illustrate our assertion with an example .",
    "to simplify things as much as possible , let us consider the metric for a _",
    "static _ spherically symmetric gravitational field produced by a spherically symmetric body at rest , i.e. @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the area radius function .",
    "one may think of this metric as roughly describing the asymptotically late - time behavior of a nearly spherical body undergoing gravitational collapse . to simplify further , take a stress - energy tensor satisfying the equation @xmath16 in einstein s field equations .",
    "the result is that @xmath17 is now a constant function which can be normalized to plus ( or minus ) one .",
    "for the first option , the area radius function is decreasing towards the future along the ray @xmath18    theories of _ non - linear _ electrodynamics generate solutions of this kind and the black - holes they produce obey the zero and the first law of black - hole mechanics @xcite .    in these coordinates",
    ", einstein s law of gravitation leads to ( see @xcite ) @xmath19 @xmath20 where the mass function , @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 and we have introduced the quantity @xmath23 for notational purposes .",
    "the stress - energy tensor results to be diagonal and it has the form @xmath24 .    if a static observer has four velocity @xmath25 he would measure a local energy density , @xmath26 and pressure , @xmath27 equal to the quantities showed in equations ( [ density ] ) and ( [ pressure ] ) respectively .",
    "extreme black - holes have zero surface gravity , @xmath28 , and in the charge - mass parameter space define a boundary beyond which black - holes do not exist .",
    "therefore , they provide an excellent place to start an analysis about cosmic censorship .",
    "let us denoted by @xmath29 any set of parameters such as the mass , the electric , or magnetic charges of some classical field theory .",
    "although in general , given @xmath29 , there are no algebraic expressions relating the locations of the horizons of the black - holes generated by these theories with the above physical parametersfor instance , in the born - infeld theory , one needs to resort to elliptic integrals of the first kinda simple rule applies for near extreme black - holes .",
    "a rule , that will allow us to surmount certain technical difficulties and , in fact , avoid the direct calculation of the roots of the equation @xmath30which is genericin order to evaluate the surface gravity inequality ( [ universal1 ] ) .",
    "an extreme black - hole satisfy @xmath31 at the horizons , where the prime denotes the partial derivative with respect to the area radius functionfrom there that its surface gravity vanishes since @xmath32 .",
    "taylor expand @xmath23 around any of the extreme values in r and @xmath29 , say for definiteness @xmath33 and @xmath34 then @xmath35 at second order , if @xmath36 , we end with a quadratic polynomial in @xmath37 .",
    "take @xmath38 in the direction that allows the existence of two real roots @xmath39 thus , it is possible to know the positions of the horizons and consequently evaluate the corresponding surface gravities .",
    "the result is @xmath40 here , it is assumed that @xmath41 . to have a bounded flux of the incident radiation at the future - cauchy horizon",
    ", it is needed that @xmath42 but for nearly extreme black - holes , whose line element is of the form ( [ line ] ) , with @xmath43 , eq.([kappa ] ) implies that ( [ mastercondition ] ) is equivalent to @xmath44 or more succinctly , in terms of the pressure given by eq.([pressure ] ) @xmath45 which must be evaluated at extreme values .",
    "expressions ( [ criteria1 ] ) or ( [ criteria2 ] ) form a simple criterion for examining the disruption of predictability in the interior of nearly extreme black - holes .",
    "for instance , it can be seen immediately that despite all the effects produced by the addition of a positive _ cosmological constant _ : ray focusing , _ compact _ achronal cross sections , etc . it does not help to enforce the cauchy - horizon - stability requirement ( [ mastercondition ] ) since it would give a vanishing contribution to ( [ criteria2 ] ) !",
    "this is a consequence of the @xmath46smoothness on the metric tensor @xcite .",
    "we would like to remark here that in the presence of a positive cosmological constant , say @xmath47 , besides the stability requirement ( [ mastercondition ] ) it is also required to satisfy the inequality @xmath48 this extra condition results from the fact of having causally aligned both the cosmological and future black - hole event horizons @xcite .",
    "let us now evoke the principle of _ local _ conservation of material energy over a small region of the space - time .",
    "taking the @xmath15component of @xmath49 we have @xmath50 .",
    "but if @xmath51 , it follows that @xmath52 hence , by ( [ criteria2 ] ) and ( [ pressrad ] ) , both the _ weak energy condition , _ i.e. @xmath53 and @xmath54 and an equation of state for the source of gravitational field satisfying @xmath55 imply the _ validity _ of the strong cosmic censorship principle inside black - holes closed enough to extremality , that possess a @xmath56 of the form ( [ line ] ) with @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 vs. @xmath59 this graph shows the cauchy - horizon instability of bardeen s black - hole . near the extreme value @xmath60 ( small circle )",
    ", the instability can be deduced from eq.([pbar ] ) . whereas when @xmath61 goes to infinity , @xmath58 approaches to @xmath62 remaining positive.,width=240 ]",
    "the bardeen model is a singularity - free black - hole solution representing the self - gravitating field of a non - linear magnetic monopole satisfying the weak energy condition @xcite .",
    "the line - element of this hole has the form ( [ line ] ) , with @xmath63 but the mass - function is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes the monopole charge and @xmath61 is the adm mass .",
    "black - hole space - times occur when the monopole charge is bounded by the adm mass as follows @xmath66 the limiting case , when this inequality is saturated , corresponds to an extreme black - hole whose horizon s area is equal to @xmath67    the maximal analytic extension of these space - times is free of space - time singularities .",
    "however , as can be readily seen by the cauchy - horizon - stability criteria ( [ criteria2 ] ) , near the extreme case , the analytic extension is unstable since @xmath68    this conclusion about instability holds true for the rest of the space of physical parameters , as shown in fig.[bardeenbh ]",
    "in view of the success of establishing a link between an inequalitywhich involves two closed but _ separated _ events in the space - timeand the _ local _ properties of the matter field that generates the near extreme black - hole background ; one may ask whether the current _ local _ hypothesis can not be extended to cover all other cases as well , where near extreme conditions do not occur . if cosmic censorship is a principle of classical physics",
    ", it should manifest itself as a consequence of the local rules in which the laws of classical physics are formulated .",
    "hence , it seems reasonable to imagine that one may proceed to develop a topological argument , in which the vanishing of the quantity @xmath69 is forbidden unless one reaches a point representing an extreme black - hole .",
    "then , by continuity , and the results of the last section , the neighborhood where @xmath70 should necessarily cover the whole simple - connected space of physical parameters that allows the existence of two horizons .",
    "let us see what are the consequences of adopting this kind of approach .",
    "firstly , since it is technically difficult to find roots for non - algebraic equations , let us change of variables , from the total charge and adm mass @xmath71 to the horizon positions @xmath72 . then , by virtue of einstein s field equations ,",
    "the determinant of the relevant jacobian is given by @xmath73 this transformation is invertible if the horizons are not degenerate and a change in the total energy density , due to an increase in the charge , @xmath74 enclosed between horizons is not zero .",
    "such a description also leads to the variation formula    @xmath75+w_-[m_{,q^2},\\kappa])\\delta q^2 , \\label{bhmechanics}\\ ] ]    where we have defined @xmath76\\equiv f'g - g'f ;   \\qquad f'=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{4g}\\kappa}\\partial_\\mathcal{a}f,\\ ] ] to denote the wronskian between two functions of the area element , @xmath77 the next step is to evaluate the function @xmath78 at a critical point .",
    "let us assume that the pressures @xmath79 and @xmath80 at @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively , are _ positive .",
    "_ then , the vanishing of the variation of @xmath83 with respect to the adm mass , @xmath84 implies @xmath85 thus , we have that @xmath7 at a critical point of @xmath86 ( if this exits ) since @xmath87 is assumed to be @xmath15decreasing in order to cover the near extreme case . to prove ( [ universal1 ] )",
    ", we shall add a further hypothesis : @xmath88 if @xmath89 , take @xmath90 . in effect , eq.([tipler ] ) implies that @xmath91 being @xmath92 a continuous function that does not vanish except at an extreme point .",
    "we conclude , by varying @xmath61 and taking different values of @xmath93 that the surface - gravity inequality ( [ universal1 ] ) holds . in such circumstances ,",
    "strong cosmic censorship holds for not necessarily extreme black - holes as well .",
    "the postulate of the constancy of the velocity of light in relativistic mechanics means that there is an upper limit to the velocity of massive particles moving along a path of maximal _ length_. in 1934 , born and infeld suggested to put forward the classical foundations of electrodynamics on a similar basis by adding two postulates :    \\1 .",
    "the existence of an _ absolute _ constant , @xmath94 placing an upper limit to the magnitude of purely electric fields , and 2 .",
    "the lagrangian of the theory to be the square root of a determinant ( see ref . ) .",
    "the _ born - infeld action _ then follows from the requirement of having maxwell theory as the limit when @xmath95 goes to zero .",
    "its lagrangian density reads    @xmath96    or @xmath97    by birkhoff s theorem , the spherically symmetric electrovac solution of einstein s field equations coupled to a born - infeld field is _ static _ and has the form @xmath98 @xcite , where @xmath99 it depends on the electric - magnetic dual invariant combination , @xmath100 that we set equal to @xmath101 , and the adm mass , @xmath84 which appears as an integration constant . here",
    ", the electromagnetic energy and pressure are given by @xmath102 and @xmath103 respectively .",
    "therefore , its equation of state is @xmath104 and the dominant energy condition , @xmath105 holds .    the spherically symmetric stationary black - holes of the born - infeld theory ,",
    "whose pure electric fieldwe recallhas bounded magnitude , do not provide counterexamples to strong cosmic censorship since : + i ) their energy density and pressures are positive , + ii ) their equation of state , of the form @xmath106 + @xmath107 satisfies @xmath108 + iii ) @xmath109 .",
    "the fact that @xmath110 is a necessary requirement for having two horizons with @xmath111 since @xmath112 we see that the born - infield theory corresponds to a limiting case of eq.([tipler ] )",
    "the criterion expressed by the inequality ( see ( [ criteria1 ] ) ) @xmath113 which would implyif verifiedthe establishment of some sort of strong cosmic censorship principle , can be generalized in a form that does not rely on the spherical assumption , and where the nature of having two non degenerate killing horizons is seen manifestly .    in effect , for a sufficiently nearly extreme black - hole let us use a chart , covering the region between the two horizons , in a manner of the adm 3 + 1 splitting @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a killing vector field , and hence , all the components of the metric have no dependence on the @xmath10coordinate .",
    "the norm of this vector is given by @xmath116 and at the horizons is assumed to vanish .",
    "alignswe assumewith a null geodesic generator @xmath117 so that @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the surface gravity along the horizon .",
    "now , let the horizon positions be given by constant values of a scalar function @xmath120 , and let us choose @xmath121 so that it approaches smoothly to the direction given by @xmath122 in the vicinity of the horizons .",
    "henceby inspection of the analysis presented in section [ extremeconditions ] , we should take @xmath126 instead of @xmath23 as a function of @xmath29 and @xmath127 and arrive to the conclusion that the criterion ( [ chstab ] ) must be replaced by the cauchy - horizon - stability requirement @xmath128    it would remain its transcription in terms of the local properties of the matter sources of the gravitational field . in view of its dependence on the first three derivatives of the metric tensor ,",
    "this can be achieved using the continuity formula @xmath129 and the euler equation @xcite , @xmath130      one further remark is in order .",
    "it is possible that by other means the condition @xmath131 could be refined somewhat .",
    "however , as was pointed out in ref.@xcite , the metric tensor has to be at least @xmath132 .",
    "if this assumption is dropped , one could construct counterexamples with space - like shells of matter , where the extrinsic curvature of the shell has a jump from one side to the other ; yet the weak energy condition still holds and there is safety in crossing the black - hole cauchy horizon .    in conclusion",
    ", there is hope that the transcription of the surface - gravity inequality ( [ universal1 ] ) , or ( [ chadm ] ) , in terms of the local properties of the matter sources of the gravitational field , would provide in more complicated situations with a reasonable set of conditions from which one may elucidate a theorem for strong cosmic censorship .",
