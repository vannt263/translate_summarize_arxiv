    "a considerable theoretical work has been done to construct a fundamental theory at higher scales , like the planck scale , which the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is its low energy limit . in such scales , there are hints that the lorentz and cpt symmetries are broken @xcite , in contrast to their conservation in the sm .",
    "the string theories @xcite and the non - commutative theories @xcite are the examples of high energy extensions of the sm .",
    "even if the lorentz and cpt symmetry violations exist in the extended theories given above , the small violations of these symmetries can appear at the low energy level .",
    "the general lorentz and cpt violating extension of the sm is obtained in @xcite . in the extension of the sm the lorentz and cpt violating effects",
    "are carried by the coefficients coming from an underlying theory at the planck scale .",
    "these coefficients can arise from the expectation values in the string theories or some coefficients in the non - commutative field theories @xcite .",
    "the loop quantum gravity @xcite , the space time foam @xcite and cosmological scalar fields @xcite are the possible sources of the lorentz violating coefficients .",
    "furthermore , the space - time varying couplings are also associated with the lorentz violation , and they affect the photon dynamics @xcite .    in the literature , there are various studies in which some of the coefficients are probed , by using the experiments @xcite .",
    "the general lorentz and cpt violating quantum electro dynamics ( qed ) extension has been studied in @xcite and in @xcite the one loop renormalizability of this extension has been shown . in @xcite",
    "the lorentz and cpt violating effects on the branching ratio @xmath2 and the cp violating asymmetry @xmath3 for the lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) interactions @xmath4 and @xmath5 , has been analyzed in the model iii version of the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) and the relative effects of new coefficients on these physical parameters have been studied .",
    "the lorentz and cpt violating effects in the maxwell - chern - simons model have been examined in @xcite and these effects in the non - commutative space time have been analyzed in @xcite . in @xcite , the theoretical overview of lorentz and",
    "cpt violation has been done ; in @xcite , the possible signals of lorentz violation in sensitive clock - based experiments has been investigated and in @xcite , the superfield realizations of lorentz - violating extensions of the wess - zumino model were presented . the threshold analysis of ultra- high - energy cosmic rays can also be used for lorentz and cpt violation searches .",
    "the basis for such threshold has been investigated in @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we study the lorentz and cpt violating effects on the @xmath6 , the cpt violating asymmetry @xmath7 and the ratio @xmath8 of the decay width @xmath9 , including only the lorentz violating effects , to the one obtained in the sm , for the flavor dependent part of the lepton flavor conserving @xmath0 ( @xmath10 ) decay .",
    "the additional contribution , coming from the lorentz and cpt violating effects , on the physical parameters we study is too small to be detected , since the corresponding coefficients are highly suppressed at the low energy scale .",
    "our aim is to investigate the relative importance of the coefficients which are responsible for the lorentz and cpt violating effects on the @xmath6 of the decays under consideration .",
    "furthermore , we predict the possible cpt violating asymmetry @xmath11 which is carried by the limited number of coefficients , @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the present process .",
    "the @xmath11 is sensitive to the flavor structure of the process , however , it is considerably small , as expected . finally , we study the ratio @xmath8 to understand contribution of the lorentz and cpt violating effects on the flavor structure of the decay and we observe that these effects are too weak to be detected in the present experiments .    the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the theoretical expression for the decay width @xmath9 , the @xmath11 and the ratio @xmath8 , for the lepton flavor conserving @xmath14 ( @xmath10 ) decay , in the case that the lorentz and cpt violating effects are switched on .",
    "section 3 is devoted to discussion and our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we study the lorentz and cpt violating effects on the @xmath6 , the cpt asymmetry and the ratio @xmath8 for the leptonic z decay . in the sm , this process is allowed at tree level and the @xmath6 is weakly sensitive to the lepton flavor .",
    "the insertion of the lorentz and cpt violating effects in the tree level brings new contribution and its size is regulated by the magnitudes of the new coefficients coming from the tiny lorentz and cpt violation .",
    "the lorentz and cpt violating lagrangian in four space - time dimensions responsible for the decay of z boson to the lepton pair reads @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 here the coefficients @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath12 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are responsible for the lorentz violation .",
    "even if the u(1 ) charge symmetry and renormalizability does not exclude the part of lagrangian including the coefficients @xmath12 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , they are not compatible with the electroweak structure of the sm extension .",
    "however , the possible nonrenormalizable higher dimensional operators respecting the electroweak symmetry and including higgs field with vacuum expectation value can create these highly suppressed terms ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "in our analysis we also take these terms into consideration since they are sources of the cpt violation ( @xcite ) .",
    "now , we would like to present the additional vertex due to the lorentz and cpt violating effects for the @xmath0 decay : @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . our aim is to calculate the decay width of the @xmath0 process including the lorentz violating effects .",
    "it is known that the invariant phase - space elements in the presence of lorentz violation are modified @xcite . in the conventional case where there are no lorentz violating effects , the well known expression for decay width in the @xmath26 boson rest frame reads @xmath27 with the four momentum vector of z boson ( lepton , anti - lepton ) @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , and the matrix element @xmath30 for the process @xmath31 .",
    "the inclusion of the new lorentz violating parameters changes the lepton dispersion relation and an additional part in the phase space element @xmath32 is switched on .",
    "the variational procedure generates the dirac equation .",
    "where @xmath33 , @xmath34 ( see @xcite for details ) , the modified dirac equation becomes @xmath35 @xmath36 and a small modification on @xmath37 in the phase space element is obtained . in our case , the corresponding dispersion relation is a complicated function of the various lorentz violating parameters ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "in addition to this , the crowd of lorentz violating parameters causes large number of fixed directions and makes the angular integrations complicated , since the amplitude has a functional dependence of these angular variables .",
    "finally , spin sums in the final state are not trivial in the case of lorentz violating effects since the phase factors depend on the outgoing lepton polarizations ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "therefore , in the present work , we do not take into account these tiny additional effects .",
    "now , we assume that all the lorentz violating coefficients , except @xmath38 and @xmath39 , are vanishing .",
    "furthermore , @xmath39 is small compared to other coefficients . after some algebra",
    ", the dispersion relation is obtained as + @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and the energy eigenvalues read @xmath42 where @xmath43 or @xmath44 . following the integration over the anti lepton four momentum @xmath45 , the phase factor @xmath46 is replaced by + @xmath47 .",
    "we expect that the factor @xmath48 in the additional part further suppresses the lorentz violating effects in the phase factor , after the kinematical integration over the lepton four momentum @xmath49 . ] and use the conventional expression for the decay width in the @xmath26 boson rest frame ( see eq .",
    "( [ decwid ] ) ) . with the inclusion of the lorentz violating effects in the matrix element , the lorentz violating part of the decay width @xmath50",
    "is obtained as @xmath51 here @xmath52 , the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the zeroth components of the coefficients @xmath55 and @xmath56 and the last term @xmath57 is @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "notice that we take only the additional part of the decay width which is linear in the lorentz violating coefficients .",
    "( [ gamlorvio ] ) shows that @xmath60 depends on the cpt even ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) and the cpt odd @xmath57 coefficients . using @xmath60",
    "it is easy to calculate the lorentz violating part of the @xmath6 ( @xmath61 ) as : @xmath62 where the @xmath63 is the total decay width of the @xmath26 boson and its numerical value is @xmath64 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath57 switches on the cpt asymmetry and it reads @xmath65 where @xmath66 this equation shows that the @xmath11 depends on the flavor part of the decay under consideration and becomes larger for the heavier lepton pair decay .    finally , we study the ratio @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) is the flavor dependent part of the decay width including only the lorentz violating ( the sm without lorentz violating ) effects .",
    "this ratio is sensitive to the lepton mass and it is dominant for the light lepton pair decay .",
    "the sm is invariant under the lorentz and cpt transformations , however , the small violations of lorentz and cpt symmetry , possibly coming from an underlying theory at the planck scale , can arise in the extensions of the sm . in this section",
    ", we analyze the lorentz and cpt violating effects on the @xmath6 and the @xmath11 for the @xmath0 ( @xmath71 ) decays , in the sm extension .",
    "furthermore , we study the ratio @xmath67 to understand contribution of the lorentz and cpt violating effects on the flavor structure of the decay .",
    "it is well known that these effects are tiny to be observed , however , it would be interesting to see the relative behaviors of different coefficients , which are responsible for the violation of the lorentz and cpt symmetry .",
    "the natural suppression scale for these coefficients can be taken as the ratio of the light one @xmath72 to the one of the order of the planck mass .",
    "therefore , the coefficients which carry the lorentz and cpt violating effects are roughly in the range of @xmath73 @xcite . here",
    "the first ( second ) number represent the electron mass @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) scale .",
    "we take the numerical values of the coefficients @xmath76 ( [ brzmumu ] ) , we present the magnitude of the coefficient dependence of the lorentz violating part of the @xmath6 ( @xmath61 ) for the decay @xmath77 . here",
    "solid ( dashed , small dashed ) line represents the dependence to the coefficient @xmath53 ( @xmath54 , @xmath57 ) , in the case that the other coefficients have the same numerical value @xmath78 .",
    "notice that , in the figures , the parameter @xmath79 denotes to the size of @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath57 for different lines .",
    "it is observed that the @xmath6 is more sensitive to the coefficient @xmath53 compared to the others and the contribution of the new effects to the @xmath6 is at the order of the magnitude of @xmath80 for the large values of the coefficient @xmath81 . with the increasing values of the coefficient",
    "@xmath57 the @xmath6 decreases for @xmath82 decay and this effect is weak for the light lepton pair case , namely @xmath83 decay .",
    "notice that the lorentz violating coefficient dependence of the @xmath61 for the decay @xmath84 is almost the same as the one for the decay @xmath83 .",
    "now , we analyze the cpt violating asymmetry @xmath11 for the decays under consideration .",
    "the coefficient @xmath57 and the lepton flavor are responsible for this violation as seen in the eq .",
