    "the purpose of this note is to describe examples illustrating theorems from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these examples will all be `` product - type '' states on non - commutative polynomials .",
    "we first recall the usual notion of a product state .",
    "let @xmath0 be two probability measures on @xmath1 all of whose moments are finite ; we identify them with states ( @xmath2 positive linear functionals taking the identity to @xmath3 ) on polynomials @xmath4 $ ] via @xmath5 = \\int_{{\\mathbb{r } } } p(x ) \\,d\\mu_i(x).\\ ] ] there are many measures on @xmath6 with marginals @xmath0 . among these ,",
    "the canonical choice is the product measure @xmath7 , corresponding to the state on @xmath8 = { \\mathbb{r}}[x_1 ] \\otimes { \\mathbb{r}}[x_2]$ ] characterized by the factorization property @xmath9 = \\mu_1[p(x_1 ) ] \\mu_2[q(x_2)].\\ ] ] for future reference , we note another factorization property that characterizes the product measure .",
    "namely , let @xmath10 be the monic orthogonal polynomials for @xmath11 .",
    "then the monic two - variable polynomials @xmath12 are precisely the monic orthogonal polynomials for @xmath7 .    in this note , we are interested in non - commutative products .",
    "that is , given states @xmath0 as above , we are interested in canonical `` product - type '' states @xmath13 on the algebra of non - commutative polynomials @xmath14 \\ast { \\mathbb{r}}[x_2]$ ] whose restrictions to @xmath15 $ ] , @xmath16 $ ] are @xmath17 , @xmath18 , respectively",
    ". one approach is to define canonical products on general , not necessarily polynomial , algebras .",
    "this approach was taken by speicher @xcite and ben ghorbal and schrmann @xcite and extended by muraki @xcite .",
    "in addition to the usual ( tensor ) product , they obtained four non - commutative products : the free product @xcite , the boolean product @xcite and the monotone and anti - monotone products @xcite . in speicher s approach , these are precisely the only constructions which are associative and universal , in the sense that there are universal polynomials expressing joint moments of elements of the product algebra in terms of individual moments of these elements .",
    "restricting to polynomial algebras changes the context significantly .",
    "one can no longer ask for associativity in a straightforward way , since having a method for defining a product state on @xmath15 \\ast { \\mathbb{r}}[x_2]$ ] does not tell us how to define a product state on @xmath19 \\ast { \\mathbb{r}}[x_2 ] ) \\ast { \\mathbb{r}}[x_3]$ ] .",
    "universal formulas also no longer make sense , since for example the property @xmath20 = \\mu_1[x_1 ^ 2 ] \\mu_2[x_2]\\ ] ] need not guarantee that @xmath21 = \\mu_1[x_1 ^ 2 ] \\mu_2[x_2 ^ 2].\\ ] ] on the other hand , the canonical grading and basis for polynomial algebras make some constructions nicer ; for example , while the boolean and monotone products are in general only defined for non - unital algebras , there is no difficulty in defining them on ( unital ) polynomial algebras .",
    "nevertheless , there are too many product - type constructions , for example the @xmath22-deformed products of @xcite and @xcite , which , while not being universal @xcite are well - defined on polynomials .    as a replacement for the universality restriction",
    ", we propose to require the factorization property of orthogonal polynomials analogous to equation  .",
    "we will see that all the non - commutative universal products have this property . on the other hand",
    ", we will also see in example  [ example : counter ] that the @xmath22-deformed products do not .",
    "indeed , none of our products are obtained as deformations .",
    "instead , they are constructed by partial degenerations of the free product .",
    "throughout the paper we consider products of two states @xmath17 , @xmath18 on @xmath4 $ ] , which for simplicity we take to be faithful .",
    "their orthogonal polynomials @xmath23 satisfy recursion relations @xmath24      we can identify the elements of the free ( non - commutative ) semigroup on two generators @xmath25 with multi - indices @xmath26 or words in the letters @xmath27 , monomials in @xmath28 , and vertices of the infinite binary tree . the semigroup operation will be denoted by concatenation .",
    "a subset @xmath29 is _ hereditary _ if for any @xmath30 , every postfix of @xmath31 is also in @xmath32 ( our words are written from the right and incremented on the left ) , that is , for @xmath33 each @xmath34 . in the binary tree ,",
    "a hereditary subset is simply a subtree containing the root .",

    "we will also see that for all the universal products , @xmath45 .",
    "finally , note that if @xmath32 is hereditary and satisfies the second condition above , then @xmath46 is hereditary as well .    for each @xmath30 , @xmath47 where @xmath48 and the rest of @xmath49 , denote @xmath50 for @xmath51 , write @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the longest postfix of @xmath31 in @xmath32 . in this case , denote @xmath54 where @xmath55    for @xmath32 as in definition  [ defn : polynomials ] , define the linear functional @xmath56 on @xmath57 by requiring that @xmath58 } = 1 , \\qquad { \\varphi_\\omega \\left [ p_{\\vec{u } } \\right ] } = 0 \\text { for } { \\left\\vert\\vec{u}\\right\\vert } \\geq 1,\\ ] ] so that these polynomials are _ centered _ with respect to @xmath56 .",

    "we will see in the proof of proposition  [ prop : orthogonal ] that in fact , all of our product states have monic orthogonal polynomials ( mops ) .",
    "not every state has that property ; those that do are characterized in theorem  2 of @xcite .",
    "conversely , the following proposition points out general properties of mops which served as the starting point for our definition  [ defn : polynomials ] .",
    "of course , not every state with mops is a product - type state .",
    "let @xmath72 be a state on @xmath57 with mops @xmath73 .    1 .",
    "the set @xmath74 is a hereditary subset of @xmath25 .",

    "[ example : counter ] in the next section we describe how all non - commutative universal product fit into our scheme .",
    "here we list two examples which do not .",
    "the tensor product @xmath72 of @xmath0 is defined by @xmath76 } = \\mu_1 \\left[x_1^{u(1 ) + \\ldots + u(n ) } \\right ] \\mu_2 \\left[x_2^{v(1 ) + \\ldots + v(n ) } \\right],\\ ] ] and the corresponding orthogonal polynomials are all of the form in equation  .",
    "these , however , are not monic orthogonal polynomials in the non - commutative sense . for example , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are not orthogonal , but rather the same .",
    "it is also easy to see that for the tensor product , part ( b ) of the preceding lemma fails . more generally , commutativity is incompatible with the mops condition , and so the tensor product does not fit into our framework .",
    "there are several different notions of the @xmath22-deformed product .",
    "however , many of them coincide in the canonical case of the @xmath22-product of @xmath22-gaussian distributions . in this case @xmath79",
    "are determined by @xmath80 see @xcite or @xcite for the description of their @xmath22-deformed product . in particular , some of the monic polynomials obtained by orthogonalization of the monomials are @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 see  @xcite for general formulas .",
    "first we note that @xmath85 unless @xmath86 , so these are not mops .",
    "second , we see that @xmath87 does not factor for @xmath88 .    by theorem  2 of @xcite ,",
    "every state @xmath72 on @xmath89 with mops has a representation of a special type on a graded hilbert space , and such states are parameterized by collections of matrices @xmath90 and @xmath91 satisfying a commutation relation . for the corresponding state @xmath92 ,",
    "the entries of these matrices are precisely the coefficients in the recursion relations for the mops of @xmath72 .",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath42 , @xmath93 with @xmath94 , @xmath95 , then @xmath96 where @xmath97 .",

    "it then follows from theorem  2 of @xcite that @xmath105 are orthogonal with respect to the state @xmath92 .",
    "since they are centered with respect to @xmath56 , it follows that they are orthogonal with respect to it , and @xmath106 .",
    "finally , part ( b ) of the proposition follows from the fact that @xmath107    the second condition in definition  [ defn : polynomials ] is not strictly necessary ; the reason for its introduction is the following result .    for generic @xmath0 , product - type states @xmath56",
    "are different for different @xmath32 .",

    "except for this last statement , the continued fraction expansion can be obtained by induction , and the only way it would break down is if some @xmath127 , which would indicate that the measure @xmath128 is finitely supported .",
    "one may hope that similarly , in the multivariate case one always has a branched continued fraction expansion ( see @xcite and many papers of the same school ) such as @xmath129 however , such an expansion need not exist in general .",
    "indeed , any power series @xmath130 can be written as @xmath131 but this need not be equal to some @xmath132 if , for example , @xmath133 but @xmath134 for some @xmath116 . even for a general state with mops , such a scalar expansion need not exist ; however , one always has a matricial continued fraction .",
    "let @xmath135 be a state with mops .",
    "then its moment generating function has a matricial continued fraction expansion @xmath136    here the vertical bar indicates where to insert the denominator .",
    "more precisely , for matrices @xmath137 we use the notation @xmath138 for example , for @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141    let @xmath135 be a state such that all the matrices @xmath142 are diagonal . denote their entries by @xmath143 , and the entries of ( also diagonal ) matrices @xmath144 by @xmath145 .",
    "the moment generating function of @xmath135 has a scalar continued fraction expansion @xmath146",
    "if @xmath147 is a product - type state , its moment generating function has a scalar continued fraction expansion corresponding to the subtree @xmath32 of the binary tree .    from the proof of proposition  [ prop : orthogonal ] it follows that @xmath106 , with all @xmath148 diagonal .",
    "as a result , in the preceding theorem , the continued fraction has the branched form @xmath149 the branching of the fraction corresponds to the subtree @xmath32 of the binary tree , and the entry in the fraction corresponding to the word @xmath150 with @xmath102 , @xmath94 is @xmath151 if @xmath152 and is simply @xmath153 if @xmath154 .",
