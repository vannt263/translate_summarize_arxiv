    "understanding the spin - fluctuations in the cuprates is an important step to understanding superconductivity .",

    "this contrasts with the symmetric cone of scattering which disperses from the ( @xmath4 , @xmath4 ) position observed in the parent insulating materials and illustrates the need for studies to be conducted on detwinned samples so that the @xmath5 anisotropy can be unambiguously resolved . at @xmath0",
    "33 mev we found a commensurate resonance peak which was strongly enhanced in the superconducting state .",
    "one of the surprising aspects of the resonance peak is that , despite the low energy scale of superconductivity ( t@xmath6@xmath059 k@xmath0 5 mev ) , superconductivity has a very strong effect on the high - energy excitations around the resonance .",
    "an important question is then how the excitations above the resonance energy are affected by superconductivity and hole doping .",

    "in magnetic systems that are two - dimensional ( eg .",
    "la@xmath1cuo@xmath8 ) , or one - dimensional ( eg .",
    "csnicl@xmath2 ) , the non - dispersive nature of the excitations along one or two directions makes the time - of - flight technique well suited for mapping out the dispersion of the excitations . for such cases the non - dispersive momentum direction",
    "is typically placed parallel to the incident wave - vector such that the scattering can be projected on the plane perpendicular to @xmath24 and the entire dispersion ( in q@xmath34 and q@xmath35 ) can be mapped out .",
    "this technique has been successfully applied to the single - layer la@xmath1cuo@xmath8 insulator where the excitations are nearly two - dimensional and there is little dispersion along the [ 001 ] axis .",
    "the situation in yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath36 is complicated by the presence of two strongly coupled cuo@xmath1 layers in the unit cell .",
    "there is a weak antiferromagnetic coupling ( of order 10 mev ) between the two layers ( separation @xmath37 ) in each unit cell .",
    "this means that the spin excitations can be categorized as odd ( or acoustic ) where the spin fluctuations are out of phase between the layers , or even ( or optic ) where they are in phase .",
    "@xcite because the bilayer coupling is antiferromagnetic the optic spin waves in the insulator have a larger energy than the acoustic .",
    "the acoustic mode intensity varies along the [ 001 ] as sin@xmath38 , where @xmath37 is the distance between the two layers in the unit cell , while the optic mode strength is proportional to cos@xmath38 .",
    "@xcite therefore , for a fixed experimental configuration different l values , and hence different acoustic and optic weights , will be sampled because l varies with energy transfer .",
    "the reason for l varying with energy is schematically outlined in fig .",
    "[ kinematics ] which shows the scattering triangle for two different energy transfers , and hence two different final energies ( note that e@xmath23 is fixed in this experiment ) . for a particular energy transfer corresponding to a final energy e@xmath31 , the constraint of having the momentum transfer of the form @xmath10=(1/2 , 1/2 , l ) fixes the value of l. therefore , by changing the energy transfer , but keeping @xmath10 to have the form @xmath10=(1/2 , 1/2 , l ) , will result in l varying with energy transfer .",
    "the effect of this is further illustrated in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ acoustsfandcutintegration ] , which shows the acoustic structure factor at @xmath10=(1/2 , 1/2 ) as a function of energy transfer for @xmath18=0@xmath20 and 20@xmath20 .",
    "the acoustic structure factor varies along [ 001 ] as sin@xmath38 , but since the value of q@xmath39 depends on the energy transfer for a fixed @xmath40=(1/2 , 1/2 ) , different acoustic and optic weights will be sampled as a function of energy . therefore , for @xmath18=0 ( see fig .",
    "[ kinematics ] ) , to sample purely acoustic scattering an energy transfer of about 30 mev or 75 mev is required .",
    "[ acoustsfandcutintegration ] also illustrates that varying @xmath18 moves the peak of the acoustic structure factor to different energy transfers .",
    "in other studies , this problem has been overcome by tuning the incident energy so that the energy position of the maximum in the structure factors would shift to the required position .",
    "such a procedure inevitably alters the resolution function and therefore the relative weight of the acoustic and optic modes . as a result",
    ", the dispersion of the acoustic and optic modes can not be reliably determined without the aid of resolution corrections .    to avoid this",
    ", we kept the incident energy fixed and varied the angle @xmath18 between the [ 001 ] axis and * k@xmath23 * ( illustrated in fig .",
    "[ kinematics ] ) .",
    "we have collected data for @xmath18=0 , 20@xmath20 , and 30@xmath20 . in each configuration",
    "we were able to extract data in up to 12 different brillouin zones ( including the ( @xmath411/2,@xmath411/2 ) , ( @xmath413/2,@xmath411/2 ) and permutations ) each of which occur for different values of l. the intensity of the magnetic scattering for each zone , sample orientation ( @xmath18 ) , and energy bin was then obtained by taking a cut ( along the [ 1 , 0 ] and [ 0 , 1 ] directions ) through the scattering at a constant energy transfer .",

    "<S> we have investigated the spin fluctuations at energy transfers up to @xmath0 110 mev , well above the resonance energy ( 33 mev ) in the yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ortho - ii superconductor using neutron time - of - flight and triple - axis techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum at high energies differs from the low - energy incommensurate modulations previously reported where the incommensurate wave vector is largely independent of energy . </S>",
    "<S> well above the resonance the peak of the spin response lies at wave vectors that increase with energy . within error the excitations at all energies above the resonance </S>",
    "<S> are best described by a ring around the ( @xmath4 , @xmath4 ) position . </S>",
    "<S> the isotropic wave - vector pattern differs from a recently reported square pattern in different but related systems . </S>",
    "<S> the spin spectral weight at high - energies is similar to that in the insulator but the characteristic velocity is @xmath0 40% lower . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a method of extracting the acoustic and optic weights at all energies from time - of - flight data . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the optic spectral weight extends to surprisingly low - energies of @xmath0 25 mev , and infer that the bilayer spin correlations weaken with increase in hole doping . </S>",
    "<S> when the low - energy optic excitations are taken into account we measure the total integrated weight around ( @xmath4 , @xmath4 ) , for energies below 120 mev , to agree with that expected from the insulator . as a qualitative guide </S>",
    "<S> , we compare spin - wave calculations for an ordered and a disordered stripe model and describe the inadequacy of this and other stripe models for the high - energy fluctuations . </S>"
