    "results from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) , especially the first - year data @xcite and to some extent the three - year data @xcite , have placed a focus on possible running of the spectral index of density perturbations ( see e.g.  lidsey & tavakol 2003 ; kawasaki , yamaguchi & yokoyama 2003 ; chung , shiu & trodden 2003 ; bastero - gil , freese & mersini - houghton 2003 ; chen et al .  2004 ; covi et al .  2004 ; ashoorioon , hovdebo & mann 2005 ; ballesteros , casas & espinosa 2006 ; cline & hoi 2006 ; corts & liddle 2006 ; easther & peiris 2006 ) .",
    "it is certainly premature to draw any strong conclusions based on existing evidence , especially as it remains controversial whether current data even support power - law models over the harrison ",
    "zeldovich ( hz ) model , but it is timely to investigate the extent to which the upcoming planck satellite may resolve the situation .    as we have stressed in several recent papers ( e.g.  mukherjee , parkinson & liddle 2006a ; parkinson , mukherjee & liddle 2006 ; liddle , mukherjee & parkinson 2006a ) , the appropriate statistical tool for assessing the need to introduce new parameters is _ model selection _ @xcite .",
    "model selection assigns probabilities to _ sets _ of parameters , i.e.  models , in addition to the usual probability distributions for parameter values within each model .",
    "for example , bayesian model selection applied to data compilations including wmap3 shows that the case for including even just the spectral index @xmath1 as a variable fit parameter is inconclusive @xcite .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", we used model selection forecasting tools to assess the ability of the planck satellite to distinguish between the harrison  zeldovich model with @xmath2 and a model with varying spectral index , vary@xmath3 .",
    "the outcome naturally depends on the assumed true value of @xmath1 , which we call the _ fiducial value _ , and we found that planck can strongly favour the latter model only if the true value of @xmath1 lies outside the range @xmath4 $ ] . in making that comparison , we assumed that the true spectrum could be described by a power - law .    in this paper",
    ", we extend that analysis to include the possibility of spectral index running , given by .",
    "this adds an extra model , vary@xmath5 , to the model set .",
    "this means that we are carrying out a three - way model comparison , within the two - dimensional space defined by the fiducial values of @xmath1 and @xmath6 .",
    "ideally we would also have included tensor perturbations in this analysis in order to fully represent the usual inflationary predictions ( e.g.  liddle & lyth 2000 ) , but the present analysis is at the limits of current computer power , having required many months of multi - processor time .",
    "our approach exactly follows our earlier paper @xcite , and so we provide only the briefest of summaries here and refer to that paper and references therein for details .",
    "model selection forecasting was first introduced by trotta ( 2007b ) , whose predictive posterior odds distribution ( ppod ) forecasting determined the probability of different model selection outcomes of future experiments based on present knowledge .",
    "an alternative approach , which delineates regions of parameter space where different model selection verdicts are expected , was introduced in mukherjee et al .",
    "( 2006b ) ; a combination of the methods was used in pahud et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and also subsequently in trotta ( 2006 ) , liddle et al .",
    "( 2006b ) and trotta ( 2007a ) .",
    "as used here , data are simulated for the different possible true values of the parameters of interest , known as fiducial values , and a model comparison analysis carried out at each point .",
    "although not required , in typical examples a simple model will be nested within a more complex one , e.g.  the hz model is the special case of vary@xmath3 with @xmath2 . if the ( assumed ) true model is the nested one , the model comparison will favour that model , and one may ask how strongly . if instead the true model is the more complex one , one can ask how far from the simple model the true values would have to be , in order that a given experiment can overcome statistical uncertainty and deliver a strong or decisive verdict in favour of the complex model .",
    "these two notions can be used to define model selection figures - of - merit , assessing the abilities of competing experiments @xcite .    in our work ,",
    "we use the bayesian evidence @xmath7 as the model selection statistic . like any model selection statistic",
    ", it creates a tension between goodness of fit to the data and the complexity of the model .",
    "it represents a full implementation of bayesian inference , being the probability of the data given the model ( i.e.  the model likelihood ) .",
    "it updates the prior model probability to the posterior model probability .",
    "computations are carried out using the nested sampling algorithm @xcite , using our code cosmonest @xcite .",
    "computing the evidence accurately is significantly more challenging than computing the posterior probability distribution , and so the calculations are computationally time - consuming .",
    "our assumption is that there are three models of interest in fitting future planck data .",
    "these are the harrison  zeldovich model , a power - law model where @xmath1 is fit from data , and a model where both @xmath1 and @xmath6 are varied .",
    "we denote these models hz , vary@xmath3 , and vary@xmath5 respectively , and also indicate them by use of subscripts 0 , 1 , and 2 respectively .    in the presence of running",
    ", the spectral index is defined in the usual way by @xmath8 the pivot scale @xmath9 corresponds to a scale well constrained by existing data . when running is included , @xmath10 is always specified at this scale , and throughout we assume the running is constant . as in pahud et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the prior range for @xmath1 is taken to be @xmath11 , representing a reasonable range allowed by slow - roll inflation models ( see e.g.  liddle & lyth 2000 ) .",
    "we take the prior on @xmath6 to be @xmath12 .",
    "this is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "slow - roll inflation models would tend to suggest a much smaller value @xcite , but there is no point in restricting the analysis to values smaller than planck can measure , as one will simply conclude that planck is unable to make the measurement . accordingly",
    ", our range is loosely motivated by present observational knowledge , corresponding to models with unexpectedly large running .",
    "the comparison between two models does have some prior dependence on the extra parameter(s ) .",
    "if one prior is widened in regions where the likelihood is negligible , then the evidence changes proportional to the prior volume , so for instance a doubling of the prior range will only reduce @xmath13 by @xmath14 .    in running cosmonest , the algorithm parameters used were @xmath15 live points and an enlargement factor of 1.8 for hz , 1.9 for vary@xmath3 , and 2.0 for vary@xmath5 .",
    "the tolerance parameter was set to 20 ( rather than 0.5 as in our previous analysis ) in order to improve the speed of the simulations .",
    "this is sufficient to give answers to good accuracy as indicated by the uncertainties obtained .",
    "four independent evidence evaluations were done for each calculation , to obtain the mean and its standard error .",
    "we then compare our models in pairs by considering the bayes factor , defined as the ratio of evidences between two models , written @xmath16 , for @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 indicate the two models under assumption . by plotting the bayes factor using datasets generated as a function of the two parameters of interest ,",
    "one uncovers the regions of the two - dimensional fiducial parameter space in which the planck satellite would be able to decisively select between the two models , and also those regions where the comparison would be inconclusive .    in order to assess the significance of any difference in evidence between two models , a useful guide is given by the jeffreys scale @xcite .",
    "labelling as @xmath19 the model with the higher evidence , it rates as ` not worth more than a bare mention ' , @xmath21 as ` substantial ' , @xmath22 ` strong ' to ` very strong ' , and @xmath23 as ` decisive ' .",
    "we simulate planck data exactly as described in pahud et al .",
    "having determined the fiducial model power spectra , we simulate temperature power spectrum data for the three most sensitive high frequency instrument ( hfi ) channels and the polarization signal for only one of these channels , modelling instrument noise using current detector specifications .",
    "the simulations are somewhat simplistic , as computational limitations prevent a more detailed treatment that might include residuals from foreground subtraction and @xmath24 noise .",
    "however they should provide a good characterization of the planck data for our purposes .",
    "simulations are carried out for various values of the spectral index and its running , and the other parameters are those of the usual @xmath25cdm model in a flat spatial geometry .",
    "the logarithm of the bayes factor , @xmath26 , as a function of the fiducial value of @xmath1 .",
    "the horizontal lines indicate where the comparison becomes ` strong ' ( dashed ) and ` decisive ' ( solid ) on the jeffreys scale.,width=283 ]    in simulating the data , we are primarily interested in the dependence on the key parameters of interest , @xmath1 and @xmath6 , and different data simulations are carried out for a grid of values in that plane .",
    "the other cosmological parameters are given fixed fiducial values as in pahud et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , namely the baryon physical density @xmath27 , the cold dark matter physical density @xmath28 , the sound horizon @xmath29 , the optical depth @xmath30 , and the density perturbation amplitude normalization @xmath31 .",
    "the corresponding value of the hubble parameter is @xmath32 .",
    "the model selection verdict should have negligible dependence on these fiducial values .",
    "note that all parameters , including these , are varied in computing the evidences of the models ; it is only in defining the fiducial models for data simulation that these parameters are fixed .",
    "the prior ranges used for these parameters are as in pahud et al .",
    "( 2006 ) : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "we begin by showing in fig .",
    "[ f : plot_lnb_01_1d ] the main result obtained in pahud et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . in that analysis",
    ", running was not included and so the fiducial @xmath6 is zero . at @xmath2 , corresponding to hz being the true model , the hz model is strongly preferred with @xmath38 .",
    "it has a higher evidence since it can fit the data just as well as vary@xmath3 and has one less parameter .",
    "once @xmath1 is far enough away from 1 , the hz fit becomes very poor and the bayes factor plummets .",
    "the speed with which this happens indicates the strength of the experiment .",
    "the vary@xmath3 model becomes strongly favoured only once @xmath39 or @xmath40 ; if the true value lies within that range even the planck satellite will give inconclusive results .",
    "figure  [ f : plot_lnb_01 ] shows the extension of our results into the plane , now showing the three - way model comparison .",
    "the left plot still shows the comparison between hz and vary@xmath3 , though neither is the true model except at @xmath41 ( fig .  [",
    "f : plot_lnb_01_1d ] is the cross - section of this plot at @xmath42 ) .",
    "the plot is not surprising in the sense that the logarithm of the bayes factor is roughly independent of @xmath6 .",
    "the models hz and vary@xmath3 are just as bad at describing a non - zero running",
    ". however , a slight tilt of the contours appears when @xmath6 goes away from zero .",
    "this indicates that a positive ( resp .",
    "negative ) running can be balanced by a scalar index smaller ( resp .",
    "bigger ) than @xmath43 , accordingly to equation ( [ running ] ) .",
    "this can benefit hz or vary@xmath3 , depending whether it helps or hinders the hz model to fit the data .",
    "in fact the effect just reflects that the scale @xmath44 is not quite at the statistical centre of the data , so that the determination of @xmath1 and @xmath6 has some correlations , and could be removed by judicious choice of the ` pivot ' scale ( corts , liddle & mukherjee 2007 ) .",
    "the centre panel now introduces a comparison of hz with vary@xmath5 , which is the true model in most of the parameter plane . at [ @xmath45=[0,1 ] , the hz model is decisively preferred with @xmath46 .",
    "its higher evidence arises since it can fit the data just as well as vary@xmath5 , but has two less parameters .",
    "once the fiducial point in the two - dimensional space is far enough away from the centre , the hz fit becomes very poor and vary@xmath5 model becomes favoured .",
    "being the true model , vary@xmath5 can simply adapt its two extra free parameters to fit the data at every point of the fiducial space equivalently , thus leading to the same evidence .",
    "we have verified this holds to excellent accuracy in our simulations .",
    "the behaviour of the bayes factor should therefore be approximately symmetrical with respect to @xmath47 and to @xmath42 .",
    "however , it is clearly not quite the case , for the same reason as the presence of the tilt in the left panel .",
    "the influence of the correlation between the two fiducial parameters is greater this time , as it acts on hz only .",
    "the logarithm of the bayes factor , @xmath48 , as a function of the fiducial value of @xmath6 .",
    "the horizontal lines indicate where the comparison becomes ` strong ' ( dashed ) and ` decisive ' ( solid ) on the jeffreys scale.,width=283 ]    finally , we need to consider a comparison between the models vary@xmath3 and vary@xmath5 , which is illustrated in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ f : plot_lnb_01 ] .",
    "this plot is fully determined by the above results , as by definition @xmath49 . moreover , for the same reason that the evidence of vary@xmath5 is independent of both fiducial parameters @xmath1 and @xmath6 , vary@xmath3 turns out to be independent of @xmath50 .",
    "this allows us to restrict our analysis to one dimension only , shown in fig .",

    "the upper panel is a false - colour rgb plot with the probabilities of hz , vary@xmath3 , and vary@xmath5 assigned to the red , green , and blue channels respectively .",
    "the lower panel simply shows the model which would receive the highest model probability at each point in the fiducial parameter space , with those three models allocated white , grey , and black respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ] +   two graphical representations of the three - way model comparison .",

    "[ f : rgb ] , we display the full three - way model comparison in two different ways . the three - model case is perfectly adapted to display by false - colour rgb plot , where the intensity of each of the three red  green  blue colour channels at a given fiducial point is assigned as the posterior model probability , given by bayes theorem , @xmath53 here we assume that the prior model probabilities @xmath54 are equal ( an assumption readily varied if required ) , so the equation simplifies to @xmath55 that the total probability sums to one corresponds to fixed total intensity .",
    "this is shown in the upper panel .",
    "the region which appears red would lead to the hz model being preferred , green the vary@xmath3 model , and blue the vary@xmath5 model . between those , regions which interpolate into secondary colours share their probability between the different models .",
    "there are also four ` vertices ' at which all three models have the same probability .",
    "we see that the transitions between the different domains are rather rapid in terms of the shifting model probabilities .",
    "the lower plot shows a much simpler representation , where regions are shaded simply according to the dominant model probability in that region .",
    "these two plots affirm the results already apparent from the earlier figures ; for planck to be able to demonstrate that @xmath56 , the true value will have to be more than 0.01 away from unity @xcite , and for running to be convincingly detected @xmath57 will need to be at least 0.02 .",
    "according to wmap3 analyses @xcite , the running is presently constrained , at 95% confidence , to be in the range of approximately @xmath58 .",
    "the precise constraints depend on both on the dataset combination used and the model assumptions made ( e.g.  whether or not to include tensor perturbations ) , and we have simply quoted the broadest available . although the range is highly skewed to negative values , the special status of @xmath41 , and the prediction from slow - roll inflation for an @xmath6 value that current experiments can not distinguish from zero , means that from a model selection point of view @xmath42 should still be regarded as a very plausible interpretation of the data .",
    "given this inconclusive position , we have addressed the extent to which the planck satellite is likely to resolve the situation , using model selection tools to compare three models : harrison  zeldovich ( hz ) , power - law initial perturbations ( vary@xmath3 ) , and the running model ( vary@xmath5 ) .",
    "the expected outcome depends , of course , on which ( if any ) of these models proves to be the correct one .",
    "supposing first that hz is the true model , we found in pahud et al .",
    "( 2006 ) that vary@xmath3 would be strongly , though not decisively , disfavoured after planck .",
    "the present paper adds the new information that the running model would be decisively disfavoured in this circumstance .",
    "suppose instead that vary@xmath3 is true . then vary@xmath3 will be strongly , but not decisively , preferred over vary@xmath5 . however , as shown in pahud et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the true value of @xmath1 has to be sufficiently far from one in order for vary@xmath3 to be favoured over hz .",
    "depending on the true parameter values , all three models may survive application of planck data .",
    "finally , suppose vary@xmath5 is true .",
    "the alternatives will only be decisively ruled out provided the true value satisfies @xmath59 , otherwise the outcome will again be indecisive .",
    "the conclusion is that planck will improve knowledge as compared to wmap3 , by a factor of around four ( our calculations indicate a projected parameter uncertainty from planck of about @xmath60 on @xmath6 , to be compared with the current @xmath61 from wmap3 alone ) , and thus does have the capability to convincingly detect running if it is prominent .",
    "however , it does not have the accuracy to probe into the region where slow - roll inflation models typically lie ( kosowsky & turner 1995 ) .",
    "our analysis refers to planck satellite data alone , and , as with wmap3 , one would expect some further tightening with incorporation of other datasets probing different length scales .    as with any bayesian analysis , the results have some dependence on prior assumptions . for the priors we have chosen on @xmath1 and @xmath6 , the data are able to constrain the likelihood well within them .",
    "consequently , any change in prior ranges that continues to respect this will just change the evidences according to the change in volume , an effect one can readily calculate .",
    "bearing in mind that the jeffreys scale is logarithmic , a sizeable change in prior parameter ranges would be needed to significantly alter the conclusions .",
