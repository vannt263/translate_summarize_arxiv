    "one hundred years after their discovery , the origin , acceleration , and propagation of galactic cosmic rays is still unclear .",
    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) and pulsars are the preferred candidate sources of galactic cosmic rays .",
    "the detection of tev @xmath0 rays and x - rays from the same locations within snrs provides strong evidence that electrons are accelerated in snrs",
    ". however , no compelling evidence for the acceleration of hadrons in snrs has yet been found .",
    "the galactic diffuse @xmath0-ray emission originates from the interactions of cosmic rays ( hadrons and electrons ) with the matter and radiation fields in the galaxy .",
    "cosmic ray hadrons interact with matter producing neutral pions which in turn decay into @xmath0 rays while cosmic - ray electrons produce tev @xmath0 rays by inverse compton ( ic ) scattering off the interstellar radiation fields .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 rays can provide information about the density and spectra of cosmic rays throughout the galaxy .",
    "gamma rays above 10 tev , produced by the highest energy particles accelerated in snr shocks , can be used to probe the acceleration processes in galactic sources .",
    "the spatial distribution of these tev @xmath0 rays can be compared to model predictions of the diffuse @xmath0-ray production from @xmath3 decays and ic scattering and thus the relative contribution of hadronic and leptonic mechanisms can be investigated .",
    "egret data on the diffuse emission from the galactic plane @xcite show a harder @xmath0-ray spectrum from the inner galaxy than predicted on the basis of the cosmic - ray spectrum and intensity measured at earth .",
    "many explanations for this `` gev excess '' have been proposed , including a harder galactic proton or electron spectrum and the annihilation of dark matter particles  .",
    "recent studies of the egret data have also investigated experimental uncertainties associated with the determination of the galactic diffuse emission and are discussed in @xcite .",
    "@xcite concluded that the egret sensitivity above 1  gev may have been overestimated , while @xcite concluded it may have been underestimated , leaving the situation unclear .",
    "the first measurement of diffuse emission above 3.5 tev from a large region of the galactic plane ( galactic longitudes @xmath4 ) indicated the existence of a tev excess  @xcite .",
    "more recent measurements of the diffuse emission near 12 tev from the cygnus region of the galaxy  @xcite also show an excess when compared to predictions of galprop , a numerical model of cosmic - ray propagation in the galaxy .",
    "recently , hess has detected very high - energy ( vhe ) diffuse emission from the galactic center ridge , that is correlated with giant molecular clouds .",
    "the spectrum of the diffuse emission from the galactic center ridge is significantly harder than the spectrum of the diffuse emission predicted by assuming the local cosmic - ray spectrum  @xcite .",
    "these previous results from milagro and hess support the hypothesis that the cosmic - ray flux is likely to vary throughout the galaxy .",
    "the milagro  @xcite experiment is a water - cherenkov detector at an altitude of 2630  m. it is composed of a central 60  m @xmath5 80  m pond with a sparse 200  m @xmath5 200  m array of 175 `` outrigger '' tanks surrounding it .",
    "the pond is instrumented with two layers of photomultiplier tubes .",
    "the top , `` air - shower '' , layer consists of 450 pmts under 1.4  m of water while the bottom , `` muon '' , layer has 273 pmts located 6  m below the surface .",
    "the air - shower layer allows the accurate measurement of shower particle arrival times used for direction reconstruction and triggering .",
    "the greater depth of the muon layer is used to detect penetrating muons and hadrons .",
    "the outrigger array , added in 2003 , improved the angular resolution of the detector from @xmath60.75@xmath1 to @xmath60.45@xmath1 by providing a longer lever arm with which to reconstruct events .",
    "milagro s large field of view ( @xmath62 sr ) and high duty cycle ( @xmath7% ) allow it to monitor the entire overhead sky continuously , making it well - suited to measuring diffuse emission .    here",
    ", the milagro measurement of the diffuse emission around 15 tev from a region of the galactic plane of longitudes @xmath8 $ ] and @xmath9 $ ] , and latitudes @xmath10 $ ] is presented .",
    "the measured @xmath0-ray flux and the latitudinal and longitudinal profiles of the emission are reported and compared to predictions of the galprop model  . in galprop , first the propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy is modeled , and then the @xmath0-ray emissivities are calculated using the propagated spectra of cosmic rays and the gas and radiation densities .",
    "the `` conventional '' model is tuned to reproduce the local direct cosmic - ray measurements .",
    "the `` optimized '' model has been designed to reproduce the egret data by relaxing the restriction from the local cosmic - ray measurements . in this version of the model ,",
    "the proton spectrum is constrained by the cosmic - ray antiproton measurements and the electron spectrum is constrained using the egret data themselves .    below",
    ", the course of the analysis is described , followed by the presentation of the results and a comparison with galprop predictions . in the last section ,",
    "likely interpretations of the observations are discussed .",
    "the milagro data , collected between july 2000 and november 2007 , were analyzed using the method described in  @xcite .",
    "only events with a zenith angle less than @xmath11 are included , which corresponds to declinations between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the event excess is calculated using the background estimation method described in  @xcite with the modification that the events are weighted by a factor dependent on the @xmath0-hadron separation parameter @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "only declinations @xmath15 are considered .",
    "this choice is governed by the fact that for @xmath16 the galactic equator turns parallel to the right ascension axis .",
    "this causes the ratio of on- to off - time in the background calculation  @xcite to become too big for signal bin sizes of 2 deg longitude by 4 deg latitude which is the bin size that is used in the galactic longitude flux profile . as a result ,",
    "the present analysis is insensitive for @xmath16 or @xmath17 $ ] .    within the region studied here , milagro has previously detected four sources and four source candidates  @xcite . the contribution from these sources",
    "is taken into account by modeling each source as a two - dimensional gaussian plus a constant .",
    "the source location @xmath18 , the amplitude and radial width of the gaussian , and the constant are determined using a @xmath19 minimization .",
    "the excess from each source is then calculated bin by bin using the resulting gaussian function and subtracted from the total excess in the @xmath20 bin event excess map of the galactic plane .",
    "the resulting diffuse event excess is converted to a flux with a monte carlo simulation of extensive air showers ( corsika ,  @xcite ) and of the milagro detector ( geant4 ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the diffuse flux is calculated assuming a power law photon spectrum with a differential spectral index @xmath21 .",
    "this spectral index was chosen to match the cosmic - ray spectrum in the energy range of this analysis ( around 10  tev ) . for a spectral index of -2.75",
    "the median energy of detected events used in this analysis is 15 tev .",
    "studies of possible sources for systematic errors have been performed .",
    "the size of the fit region around the eight sources and source candidates was varied .",
    "the gaussian fits to the event excesses were performed in boxes centered around the sources of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "the flux determination was also repeated for spectral indices of -2.4 and -2.9 .",
    "the variations of the calculated fluxes were found to be less than 18% .",
    "another study concerned the background estimation .",
    "the background is estimated using the method of direct integration , calculating a background map using events over a 2hr time interval  @xcite . to account for possible contamination of the background from signal events two prominent regions in the milagro sky map",
    "are excluded when doing this : a 2 by 2 degree region around the crab nebula location and a @xmath252.5 degree region around the galactic plane . to investigate possible systematic effects in the background estimation the size of the region of exclusion around the galactic plane",
    "was increased to @xmath255 degrees .",
    "the flux variations were found to be less than 7% .",
    "these systematic errors are added in quadrature to a 30% systematic error which is derived from the underestimation of the milagro trigger rate by cosmic ray shower simulations  @xcite .",

    "a @xmath19 of 18.3 with 20 degrees of freedom is derived , corresponding to a probability of 57% that the @xmath19 for a correct model exceeds the observed one by chance . in the cygnus region , this chance probability is calculated to be @xmath45 . the discrepancy between the model prediction of the latitude profile and the data in the cygnus region is investigated further by fitting the measured profile between @xmath46 and @xmath47 to a linear combination of the predicted pion and ic profiles , @xmath48 . the factors @xmath49 and @xmath50 are varied independently between 0.1 and 10 in steps of 0.1 . the minimum value of @xmath19 is obtained for @xmath50=6.9 , i.e. an increase of the pion contribution with respect to the galprop prediction by a factor 6.9 , and @xmath49=0.1 .",
    "the resulting chance probability is 3% .",
    "performing the same fit to the inner galaxy latitude profile yields an increase of the pion contribution of @xmath50=5.8 and a decrease of the ic contribution of @xmath49=0.1 with respect to the galprop prediction .",

    "measurements of the diffuse tev @xmath0-ray flux from the galactic plane as well as its spatial distribution , the latitude and longitude profiles , have been presented .",
    "the diffuse @xmath0-ray flux was compared to predictions based on both the conventional and the optimized galprop models . in the @xmath35",
    "$ ] range the optimized galprop prediction is consistent with the milagro measurement .",
    "according to the galprop model the diffuse emission near 15 tev is dominated by the inverse compton component , which in turn is dominated by @xmath6100 tev electrons scattering off the cmb ( 60 to 70% of the ic component , see figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "therefore , milagro measurements can be interpreted as showing the first indication of the cosmic - ray spectrum up and beyond 100 tev using the predictions of the galprop optimized model .",
    "the propagated average electron spectrum calculated by the optimized galprop model predicts a flux of about four times the locally measured flux and extends above 100 tev with a differential spectral index of -3 .",
    "an alternative explanation would be a harder nucleon injection spectrum in the inner galaxy than measured locally , but this would have to be checked against local antiproton measurements  .",
    "studies of the lateral @xmath0-ray emission profile in the inner galaxy show that the profile is rather narrow and suggest a better agreement with the pion assumption .",
    "better sensitivity is needed however to significantly differentiate between the ic and the pion hypotheses .",
    "the cygnus region is the region with the most significant flux excess in the milagro spatial maps .",
    "the emission from the cygnus region of the galaxy at longitudes @xmath2 $ ] shows an excess by a factor of two when compared to the galprop optimized model predictions .",
    "also for the cygnus region , the model predictions are dominated by ic scattering of electrons off the cmb ( see figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "however , the measured and predicted profiles are inconsistent ( see figure  [ fig : lon_prof30_65_85_110 ] ) . decreasing the ic contribution ( which has a broad profile distribution ) and increasing the pion contribution ( which has a narrow profile distribution ) with respect to the model prediction improves the agreement in the shape , reflecting that the latitude distribution measured by milagro is rather narrow compared to the distribution predicted by the optimized galprop model .",
    "the cygnus region hosts intense star formation activity , and is abundant with molecular clouds and candidate cosmic ray sources .",
    "the hegra source tev j2032 + 413 is located in the area with the largest concentration of molecular and atomic hydrogen in the cygnus region and spatially coincident with the milagro source mgro j2031 + 41  @xcite . for tev j2032 + 413",
    "an association has been proposed with cygnus ob2 , the largest cluster of more than 2700 identified young stars at 5000 light year distance  .",
    "very close to tev j2032 + 4130 , the vla has detected a weak non - thermal shell supernova remnant  @xcite and more recent xmm - newton observations have revealed the presence of an extended x - ray source co - located with tev j2032 + 4130 , which could be produced by an unknown population of faint x - ray sources  . in order to explain the x - ray and tev emissions from tev j2032 + 413 , proposed both a hadronic and a leptonic scenario . in the hadronic scenario ,",
    "the x - ray emission would be produced by the synchrotron emission of secondary electrons and the emission above 10 tev should show a hard spectrum . if the x - ray and tev emissions were instead of leptonic origin , the spectrum above 10 tev should be rather soft due to the unavoidable klein - nishina suppression of the inverse compton cross section .",
    "if cosmic rays are injected into the galactic interstellar medium by any of these candidate counterparts to tev j2032 + 4130 and mgro j2031 + 41 , then the newly accelerated cosmic rays interact with the local gas and produce @xmath0 rays within 100 pc from the source with spectra which might be significantly different from the average @xmath0-ray spectrum , because the cosmic - ray spectrum has not yet been steepened by diffusion  . assuming a distance of about 1 kpc , the extension of the entire cygnus region is about 300 pc , and thus a single accelerator might influence strongly the entire region . assuming the diffusion process to be energy dependent",
    ", the emission from a molecular cloud close to such an accelerator could be due to high energy protons which have been accelerated first , have left the remnant first , and have already reached the cloud , as they diffuse faster . thus this emission would have a flatter spectrum and could produce vhe @xmath0 rays in the milagro energy range during the first 10,000 years after the sn explosion  @xcite .",
    "leptonic mechanisms for the production of vhe @xmath0 rays are disfavored by the fast cooling of such highly energetic electrons . assuming a cosmic - ray source of total energy @xmath51 ergs having exploded less than 10,000 years ago in the ism and a molecular cloud of total mass greater than @xmath52 and less than @xmath53 solar masses  @xcite",
    ", the hard spectrum cosmic ray nucleons scattering off the targets in the cygnus region would produce a flux between @xmath54 and @xmath55 tev@xmath38@xmath39s@xmath38 near 15 tev ( see figure 1 of  @xcite ) .",
    "calculated from table  [ tab : fluxes ] , the emission measured by milagro near 15 tev not explained by galprop is roughly @xmath56 tev@xmath38@xmath39s@xmath38 , meaning that only a few strong young accelerators in the cygnus region are needed to explain the excess emission measured by milagro .",
    "the results herein and previously presented by the milagro collaboration provide further evidence for the existence of cosmic - ray accelerators in the cygnus region of the galaxy , favoring hadronic production mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "if the emission originates from hadronic interactions of hard spectrum cosmic rays , a corresponding flux of neutrinos will arise from decay of charged pions , and neutrino detectors such as icecube could provide the conclusive probe of proton acceleration in the galaxy  @xcite .    experiments like glast ( with its improved sensitivity and angular resolution with respect to egret ) will be able to separate the truly diffuse @xmath0-ray emission from a potentially unresolved source component , and probe the spatial distribution of the diffuse emission at gev energies ( the `` gev excess '' ) .",
    "experiments like the proposed high altitude water cherenkov ( hawc ) detector will be able to constantly survey large regions of the sky , in particular the galactic plane , at @xmath0-ray energies up to @xmath6100 tev with 10 to 15 times the sensitivity of milagro . because of its more southerly location",
    "it will also be more sensitive to galactic plane regions below @xmath57 .",
    "this will put stricter constraints on models like galprop and thus provide crucial information about the propagation of cosmic rays above 100 tev .",
