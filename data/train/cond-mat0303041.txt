    "several random protocols ( i.e. , stochastic rules for adding / deleting nodes and edges ) that lead to the emergence of scale - free networks have been recently proposed .",
    "the underlying dynamics for almost all of these models follow the principle of preferential attachment for targeting or initiating newly created links of the network .",
    "the simplest case is the linear preference for the target node of a new link : a node is added to the network at each time step , and the probability that a node @xmath2 with @xmath3 links at time @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) receives a new link at time @xmath6 , is @xmath7 .",
    "the resulting network for this simple model has a power - law degree distribution with an exponent @xmath8 .",
    "other variations of this procedure have also been widely studied @xcite .",
    "the interesting properties of random power - law networks appear when the degree exponent @xmath9 .",
    "these properties include almost constant diameter and zero percolation threshold . moreover , almost all cases of power - laws observed in real life networks , which these models ultimately might want to account for , have exponents less than @xmath0 .",
    "motivated by both these issues , a few stochastic linking rules resulting in exponents with magnitude less than @xmath0 have been introduced .",
    "examples of such protocols include , the doubly - preferential attachment scheme for links , where both the initiator and the target nodes of an edge are chosen preferentially , as proposed in @xcite , and the rewiring scheme of existing links to preferential targets as proposed in @xcite .",
    "the key to having an exponent with magnitude smaller than 3 ( see discussions in section ) is to ensure more than one preferential attachment per link .",
    "most of these random protocols have been motivated by the need to model _ growing _ and mostly _ rigid _ networks , where nodes and links are gradually added .",
    "examples of such graphs are the citation and collaboration networks .",
    "once a connection is made between two nodes in these graphs it is never deleted and also nodes never leave the network .",
    "a second class of networks that has been studied is where the nodes are stable , but the links could be deleted .",
    "for example , on the www one can assume nodes to almost always remain in the network once created ; however , existing links can easily be deleted , and new links created . in this paper , we primarily address a third class of networks ( first introduced in @xcite ) , where the nodes themselves are also _ unstable _ and _ unreliable _ , and in an extreme case , the nodes ( and hence all their connections ) might leave the network without prior notice and through independent decisions . .",
    "our motivation for considering such dynamic networks comes , in part , from the recent interest towards less structured or _",
    "ad hoc _ distributed system designs with peer - to - peer ( p2p ) content sharing networks as a prime example . in an instance of gnutella , for example , a study @xcite shows that almost 80% of all nodes log - off within five hours from their log - in .",
    "hence , the time scale within which the network assumes its structure is much shorter than the time scale within which it grows .",
    "a number of crawls of these networks show that at least in some regimes they follow a power - law .",
    "however , a stochastic model that can lead to the emergence of such complex networks has not been proposed .",
    "another significant example is the _ ad hoc _ and mobile communication paradigms where each member can provide a short - time _",
    "unreliable _ service and yet a global topological structure is to be ensured at all times .",
    "we first use the continuous rate equation approach introduced in @xcite ( see section [ ii ] ) to predict the power - law exponent for stochastic models , where new nodes joining the network make links preferentially , and existing nodes in the network are uniformly deleted at a constant rate .",
    "contrary to previous claims @xcite , we show that for such models the power - law degree distribution of the resulting network has an exponent @xmath10 , and that it rapidly approaches @xmath11 as the deletion and insertion rates become equal .",
    "thus a network with even small deletion rates will essentially have characteristics that are more similar to an exponential degree distribution . in section [ iii ] , we introduce our compensatory rewiring procedure , which is a novel way to exploit the deletion dynamic of the nodes itself to maintain a scale - free structure . in this protocol ,",
    "in addition to the new nodes making preferential attachments , existing nodes compensate for lost links by initiating new preferential attachments . in fact , we show that the exponent of the power - law for the degree distributions of the resulting networks for any deletion rate , can be tuned as close to @xmath12 as desired .",
    "thus , our results provide a random protocol for generating scale - free networks even in the limit where the deletion and addition rates are equal and the network size is almost constant . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the only procedure resulting in scale - free structures with exponent arbitrary close to @xmath12 while the network size is almost constant .",
    "these results can be applied for both analysis and design of complex networks ( see section [ v ] ) .",
    "for example , our results provide an intuitive account for the existence of scale - free structures in many of the p2p networks @xcite .",
    "perhaps , more significantly , _ our results provide a truly local protocol for generating highly dynamic scale - free and tunable networks_. while such scale - free unstructured p2p networks have been thought to inherently suffer from scalability problems related to searching , our recent results prove this commonly - held notion to be false , and show that one can indeed perform searches in highly scalable fashion on such networks @xcite .",
    "thus , one could use the protocols introduced in section  [ iii ] to design very active and efficiently searchable content sharing networks .",
    "the scale free properties of growing networks that incorporate preferential attachment with _ permanent deletion of randomly chosen links _ was considered by dorogovtsev et al @xcite .",
    "they concluded that the scale free properties of the emerging network depends strongly on the deletion rate of the links , and in fact the scale free behavior is observed only in low deletion rates .",
    "however , the analysis of the effect of _ random deletions of nodes at a fixed rate _ was incomplete .",
    "a correct analysis is presented in this section , and as noted in the introduction , the associated results are shown to have far - reaching consequences for ad hoc networks .",
    "was considered , and conclude that the scale free property of the emerging network does not depend on the deletion rate and the power - law exponent is unaffected . in this section ,",
    "we incorporate essentially the same approach and show that in fact this is not the case , and though the resulting network is still scale free , the power - law exponent strongly depends on the deletion rate and @xmath13 is always greater than @xmath0 . in the limit of very high node deletion rate , when one node is deleted for each node inserted , the degree distribution becomes exponential .",
    "+      we consider the following model : at each time step , a node is inserted into the network and it makes @xmath14 attachments to @xmath14 preferentially chosen nodes .",
    "that is , for each of the links , a node with degree @xmath15 is chosen as a target with probability proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "then with probability @xmath16 , a randomly chosen node is deleted .",
    "we adopt the same approach as introduced in @xcite for our analysis .",
    "let each node in the network be labelled by the time it was inserted , and define @xmath3 as the degree of the node inserted at time @xmath2 ( i.e. , the @xmath17 node ) at time @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath18 be the probability that the @xmath17 node is not deleted ( i.e. , it is still in the network ) until time @xmath4 . assuming the @xmath19 node to be in the network at time @xmath4 , the rate at which its degree increases is : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the sum over the degrees of all nodes _ that are present _ in the network at time @xmath4 , and @xmath22 is the total number of nodes in the network .",
    "note that the first term in eqn .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) is simply the number of links node @xmath2 receives as a result of the @xmath14 preferential attachments made by the newly introduced node .",
    "the probability that a randomly chosen node is among the neighbors of node @xmath2 , and hence the probability that node @xmath2 loses a link , is of course , @xmath23 , which accounts for the second term in eqn .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "we neglect all higher order effects .",
    "next , we solve the various unknown quantities in the following order : @xmath18 , @xmath24 , and then @xmath3 .",
    "first , using independence of the events corresponding to random deletions of nodes at each time step , it is easy to verify that @xmath25 .",
    "hence , the continuous version of the dynamic of @xmath18 can be stated as follows : @xmath26 since , @xmath27 , we get @xmath28 to find @xmath24 , we first multiply both sides of eqn .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) by @xmath18 and integrate out @xmath2 from @xmath29 to @xmath4 .",
    "then , @xmath30 the left - hand - side of the above equation can now be simplified as follows : @xmath31 -k(t , t)d(t , t)-\\nonumber\\\\      & \\hbox{\\hspace*{-2.75 in } } & \\hbox{\\hspace*{-2.0in}}\\int_{0}^{t}k(i , t)\\frac{c}{t(c-1)}d(i , t)di\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting the above expression in eqn .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) , and noting that @xmath32 and @xmath27 , we get @xmath33 the solution to the above equation is : @xmath34 since the correctness of this last equation is the key to further derivations and since this equation marks the departure from the results in @xcite , we have paid especial attention to it . in particular ,",

    "thus , one might want to work in the regime , @xmath117 and @xmath110 , where @xmath66 but @xmath118 as @xmath111 .",
    "for example , if @xmath86 and @xmath95 , then one can get an exponent of @xmath119 , and yet have the expected degree of any node to be bounded .",
    "we first point out a conceptual link between our compensatory rewiring scheme discussed in section [ iii ] , and the doubly preferential attachment scheme , as introduced in @xcite . by doubly preferential attachment ,",
    "we mean that for an edge inserted in the network , both the initiator and the target nodes are chosen preferentially based on their degrees .",
    "for example , consider the following random protocol : at each time step , a new node is inserted that makes @xmath14 connections to @xmath14 preferentially chosen nodes . from the nodes in the network ,",
    "@xmath120 nodes are chosen with probability proportional to their degrees .",
    "each of these selected nodes initiates @xmath14 new links to @xmath14 preferentially chosen targets .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the power - law exponent @xmath121 , and hence , by choosing @xmath120 one can make the exponent as close to @xmath12 as desired . in this",
    "regard , our compensatory rewiring scheme can be considered as a natural means for introducing doubly preferential attachments . by uniformly deleting nodes",
    ", a node looses links with probability proportional to its degree .",
    "so a node initiating a compensatory preferential attachment , intrinsically introduces doubly preferential attachments .",
    "the random deletions of nodes is thus being used in our stochastic protocol to lead to the emergence of truly scale - free networks .",
    "one of our main motivations for this work was to design random protocols that will solve the problem of organizing a highly - dynamic content sharing network .",
    "the first step in this direction would be to design a local and easily implementable protocol that would lead to the emergence of a pre - specified network structure under the usage constraints imposed by the users . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "although the network size usually grows for such networks ( more people join such networks ) , the time scale within which the size changes is much larger than the time scale within which the old members of the network log - in and log - off .",
    "hence , the desired form of the network structure should emerge almost solely due to the dynamics of the protocol and can not rely too much on the growth rate itself . as regarding the desired structure of the network , motivated by many advantageous aspects of scale free networks , one might want to come up with protocols that could make the network self organize into a scale - free structure with a desired power - law exponent ( usually around @xmath122 )",
    ".    there has been some concern that searches on such power - law networks might not be scalable ; however , our recent results show that by using bond percolation on the underlying networks , one can make such networks very efficiently searchable . in particular ,",
    "we show that for networks having a power - law degree distribution with exponent close to @xmath12 , a traffic efficient search strategy can be locally implemented .",
    "specifically , we show that @xmath123 communications on those networks are sufficient to find each content with probability @xmath38 .",
    "this is to be compared to @xmath124 communications for currently used broadcast protocols .",
    "also , the search takes only @xmath125 time steps @xcite .",
    "thus , scale - free structures with exponents close to @xmath12 , are not only observed in current p2p systems , but also are the desirable structures for realizing a truly distributed and unstructured p2p data - base system .",
    "the very high rate of log - offs in real p2p networks prevents the ordinary preferential attachment scheme from forming a scale free network , with exponents less than @xmath0 ( as shown in the sec .",
    "[ ii ] ) . the local compensation process introduced in sec .",
    "[ iii ] , however , imposes a scale free structure with an exponent that can always be kept below @xmath0 .",
    "all a node has to do is to start a new preferential connection , whenever it looses one ! note that this compensatory procedure is quite natural ( and probably essential ) for networks in which the members have to be part of the giant connected component to be able to have access to almost all other nodes .",
    "in fact , in many clients of the existing p2p networks , this condition is imposed by always keeping a constant number of links to active ip addresses .",
    "our numerical simulations show that graphs resulting from our compensatory protocol are almost totally connected ; that is , a randomly chosen node with probability one belongs to the giant connected component of the graph even in the limit of @xmath96 .",
    "thus , _ using our decentralized compensatory rewiring protocol one can launch , tune , and maintain a dynamic and searchable p2p content - sharing system_.    we also believe that our model can , at least intuitively , account for the degree distributions found in some crawls of p2p networks like gnutella . as an example , in @xcite , the degree distribution of the nodes in a crawl of the network was found to be a power - law with an exponent of @xmath126 .",
    "although gnutella protocol @xcite does not impose an explicit standard on how an agent should act when it loses a connection , there are certain software implementations of gnutella which try to always maintain a minimum number of connections by trying to make new ones when one is lost .",
    "thus , while all clients might not be compensating for lost edges , it is reasonable to assume that at least a certain fraction are . as shown in sec .",
    "[ iii ] , if we pick @xmath86 ( i.e. 75% of the lost links are compensated for ) , and as @xmath95 , the degree distribution is indeed a power - law with exponent @xmath119 .",
    "to summarize , we have designed truly local and yet universal protocols which when followed by all nodes result in robust , totally - connected and scale - free networks with exponents arbitrarily close to @xmath12 even in an _ ad hoc _ , rapidly changing and unreliable environment .",
