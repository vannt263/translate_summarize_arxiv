    "for example , the presence of surfactants  @xcite , surface tension and elasticity  @xcite , or an adsorption layer  @xcite modifies the frequency - dependent mobility close to the interface . to establish brownian motion as a local reporter of frequency - dependent surface properties",
    "a detailed understanding of the complex interplay of the hydrodynamic flow and the colloidal thermal fluctuations is a prerequisite .",

    ", one should record the time - dependent information , e.g. the mean - square displacement or the velocity autocorrelation , at times scales before the regime of simple diffusion is attained . using weak optical trapping the quasi - free brownian particle s trajectory can be monitored interferometrically  @xcite with a time resolution of a few microseconds and a simultaneous positional sensitivity in the sub - nanometer regime  @xcite .    in the diffusive regime the momenta of the colloid",
    "are equilibrated with the surrounding fluid and are irrelevant for the brownian motion . at very short times",
    "the particle s motion is ballistic as expected by newton s laws .",
    "hence , only after the colloid s initial momentum is transferred to the fluid the particle undergoes a random walk characterized by diffusion coefficients .",
    "the time scale where this transition occurs may be navely estimated by balancing the particle s inertia with the stokes drag , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the mass of the colloid , @xmath3 its radius , and @xmath4 the shear viscosity of the fluid . since momentum is conserved it can only be transported by vortex diffusion giving rise to another characteristic time scale @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the density of the fluid .",
    "the time a vortex emitted from the colloid to reach the wall separated at a distance @xmath7 may be estimated by the characteristic time @xmath8 .",
    "the dynamical information on how the diffusive regime is reached , is encoded in the velocity autocorrelation function ( vacf ) @xmath9 for the motion parallel to the surface and similarly perpendicular to the wall . in bulk",
    "the vacf exhibits a power - law decay @xmath10 at long times due to slow vortex diffusion .",
    "this long - time tail is also expected in the presence of a wall for times up to @xmath11 . for longer times this leading non - analytic behavior",

    "an algebraic decay @xmath12 for motion parallel and a @xmath13 long - time tail for motion perpendicular to the wall has been predicted by gotoh and kaneda  @xcite extending an earlier work of wakiya  @xcite .",
    "however , the result for the perpendicular motion is erroneous , as pointed out by felderhof  @xcite .",
    "he succeeded also in calculating the frequency - dependent mobility for all frequencies in both directions and thus giving an analytic solution for the motion close to the wall up to fourier transform .",
    "later , he generalized this work to the case of a compressible fluid  @xcite and to a second bounding wall  @xcite .",
    "computer simulations for a colloidal particle confined between two walls demonstrate that the long - time behavior of the vacf is strongly affected by the confinement  @xcite .",
    "recently , we have reported direct measurements of the velocity autocorrelation function of a single colloid immersed in water close to a bounding wall  @xcite .",
    "we have observed that the time - dependent vacf becomes anisotropic and exhibits the non - algebraic tails that had been anticipated much earlier  @xcite . to observe the particle for sufficiently long times close to a wall we used a trap constraining the brownian motion even more .",
    "the optical trap introduces a harmonic restoring force @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes the displacement from the trap center and @xmath16 the spring constant . ignoring the wall a new time scale can be constructed @xmath17 characteristic of the positional equilibration in the trap .",
    "here we supplement our experimental results with a derivation of the theoretical description of the brownian motion confined by a harmonic potential and a bounding wall .",
    "in particular , we discuss the complex interplay of the weak trap with hydrodynamic memory originating from the obstructed vortex motion .",
    "we show that even if the trapping time @xmath18 exceeds the characteristic time scales of particle momentum relaxation @xmath19 , fluid momentum diffusion @xmath20 , and the wall - vortex reflection @xmath11 , by several orders of magnitude it still has a significant influence on the velocity autocorrelation function .",

    "in this section we review the theoretical basis elaborated by felderhof  @xcite for the motion of a single colloid in the vicinity of a wall .",
    "the fluid is treated as a continuum described by the navier - stokes equations , the colloid is modeled as an impenetrable sphere embedded in a viscous incompressible fluid . at the particle s surface",
    "the usual no - slip boundary conditions are imposed . by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem",
    "the velocity autocorrelation function is related to the frequency - dependent admittance  @xcite , hence it suffices to calculate the deterministic velocity response of the colloid to an external force .",
    "the external force @xmath21 causes the motion of both the particle and surrounding fluid , which reacts by exerting a time - dependent drag force .",
    "newton s second law for the acceleration of the sphere reads after a temporal fourier transform @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the velocity of the colloidal particle , @xmath24 its mass , and @xmath25 denotes the mass of the displaced fluid .",
    "the total _ induced force _",
    "@xmath26 corresponds to the frequency - dependent drag force on the particle up to the acceleration force @xmath27 of a rigid sphere of fluid of equal radius .",
    "we shall employ the _ point particle limit _ where inhomogeneities of the flow on the scale of the colloid are ignored .    to calculate the total induced force one maps the problem in the presence of a bounding surface to a corresponding one in infinite space and employs the generalized faxn theorem of mazur and bedeaux  @xcite : for an unbounded fluid the frequency - dependent induced force @xmath26 is @xmath28}({\\mathbf}{u}_\\omega-{\\mathbf}{v}'_\\omega )   \\ , , \\label{eq : mazur}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath29 and @xmath30 denoting the unperturbed flow evaluated at the position of the particle @xmath31 .",
    "the branch cut is chosen such that @xmath32 . then consider as acting flow @xmath33 where @xmath34 denote the solutions of the navier stokes equation in response to a point force @xmath35 acting at @xmath31 in the presence of a bounding surface and in the infinite space .",
    "clearly , @xmath36 satisfies the homogenous stokes equations .",
    "the key idea is that @xmath37 can be interpreted as a flow in infinite space resulting from the force @xmath35 with @xmath36 as an externally acting flow . yet , for flows in infinite space the generalized faxn theorem applies and the induced force can be calculated easily .    by linearity of the navier - stokes equation , the fluid response to a point force @xmath35 acting at @xmath31 is obtained by @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the corresponding ( tensor ) green s functions .",
    "then the acting flow at the position of the particle reads @xmath41 , where @xmath42 defines the reaction field tensor .",

    "in the framework presented above it is implicitly assumed that the distance @xmath7 between the particle and its bounding wall is time - independent .",
    "to realize this situation experimentally and to prevent the particle from leaving the detection region a trap is needed , which should be included to complete the model . already in bulk ,",
    "the motion of a harmonically bound brownian colloid differs drastically from a free particle , since at long enough times the restoring forces limit the particle s mean - square displacement to a finite value .",
    "the very first attempt by uhlenbeck and ornstein  @xcite to model the interplay of inertia of a particle , stokes friction and harmonic restoring forces dates back to 1930 but ignores hydrodynamic memory effects .",
    "only much later , clercx and schram  @xcite incorporated the fluid inertia generalizing the vacf for the free motion .",
    "in particular , they found that the long - time anomaly changes from a @xmath10 behavior for a free particle to a much more rapid decay according to @xmath13 . here ,",

    "again by symmetry , the matrix @xmath70 is diagonal with elements @xmath71 and @xmath72 for the force @xmath35 parallel or perpendicular to the wall .",
    "the trap introduces a new characteristic time scale @xmath18 into the problem : balancing the harmonic restoring force @xmath73 with the zero - frequency stokes drag @xmath74 , one obtains @xmath75 .",
    "the reference drag force has been chosen as the one acting in bulk , although it is clear that the presence of a boundary suppresses the hydrodynamic friction .",
    "the physical interpretation of the dependences is that a stronger trap will lead to a faster relaxation to equilibrium resulting in a reduction of @xmath18 , whereas an increase of the stokes drag induced by a larger viscosity leads to slowing down of the equilibration process .    in the derivation",
    "we have assumed that the trapping is isotropic , i.e. the spring constants are identical for all directions of the displacement . in case",
    "the trapping potential becomes anisotropic , the restoring force is still given by @xmath76 where the spring constant @xmath16 has to be interpreted as a symmetric matrix .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ eq : ytrap ] ) still holds , and if the principal axes of the trap includes the direction perpendicular to the wall , the matrix inversion is achieved by inverting the diagonal elements .",
    "let us compare eq .",
    "( [ eq : ytrap ] ) to the well known high- and low - frequency limits . for high frequencies",
    "the trap becomes increasingly irrelevant and the response is dominated by the inertia of the particle and the displaced fluid . in the low - frequency regime the harmonic potential suppresses the admittance reflecting the fact that no static external force can induce a stationary motion of the particle in confinement .",
    "here we focus on the velocity autocorrelation function ( vacf ) @xmath77 for the motion parallel and perpendicular to the wall , @xmath78 .",
    "the vacf are connected to the admittances of the previous section via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xmath79 where @xmath80 denotes the thermal energy .",
    "this relation holds for all cases , i.e. parallel and perpendicular to the wall , with and without trap . to simplify notation",
    "we have suppressed the dependence on the position @xmath31 .    due to trapping the particle samples only a region close to the center of the trap and according to a stationary ensemble given by the gibbs - boltzmann measure . in particular , time - dependent position correlation functions like @xmath81 are well defined . in the derivation for the admittances , the position of the particle",
    "was assumed to be fixed at @xmath31 .",
    "however , since the particle fluctuates and takes excursions from the center of the trap of typical magnitude @xmath82 , the spring constant of the trap has to be strong enough in order to render these fluctuations negligible compared to the distance to the wall @xmath7 .",
    "the short - time evolution of the velocity autocorrelation is inferred from the high - frequency behavior of the corresponding admittances .",
    "obviously , the harmonic restoring forces do not affect the initial value and they are still given by @xmath83 without a bounding surface",
    "@xmath84  @xcite is recovered .",
    "the equipartition theorem suggests that the initial value should read @xmath85 for all cases .",
    "however , as discussed already by zwanzig and bixon  @xcite , there is an additional rapid decrease of the vacf if the finite compressibility of the fluid is taken into account .",

    "the presence of the factor @xmath98 renders the amplitude of the subleading term to a large quantity . balancing both terms",
    "yields an estimate @xmath99 for the time one has to wait in order to observe the true long - time behavior .",
    "hence the perpendicular motion without trap exhibits a zero crossing on a time scale much longer than the nave guess @xmath11 .",
    "we shall see in the next section that even a weak trap has strong implications for this intermediate time behavior .",
    "the inverse fourier transformation can not be calculated analytically , since the admittance tensors are not simple elementary functions . a numerical fourier transformation can easily be performed , and since the time - correlation functions are real and even in time , a fourier - cosine transformation is sufficient @xmath100\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the vacf exhibits long - time power - law behavior the admittance has to be sampled over many decades in frequency . a conventional fast fourier transform ( fft ) is rather ill - suited to achieve this and would also calculate @xmath101 on an equidistant time grid not convenient for our purposes .",

    "however , as is discussed in fig .",
    "[ fig : cwall ] the trap has significant impact on the velocity correlation functions even if the characteristic time scales differ by orders of magnitude .",
    "the reason for such a behavior is twofold : first , the hydrodynamic memory leads to a scale - free power - law long - time decay and the parameters @xmath117 , and @xmath11 determine merely the amplitude of the algebraic behavior rather than a characteristic decay time .",
    "second , for the point particle limit to apply accurately , @xmath118 , and the vacfs become small at times @xmath119 where the tail @xmath12 is expected to set in .",
    "thus already a weak trap has a strong influence on the signal where the interesting hydrodynamic memory effect dominates the vacfs .",
