    "interaction of an electromagnetic radiation with atoms is one of the oldest @xcite and central problems in quantum optics .",
    "in particular , the interaction of several two - level atoms @xcite as well as a single two - level atom @xcite with a single - mode squeezed radiation have attracted the attention of several authors over the years .",
    "in addition to the existing huge theoretical investigations , there are also significant amount of experimental works related to two - level atoms in an optical cavity pumped externally with a coherent radiation , wherein the coupling through the mirrors is taken into consideration @xcite .",
    "earlier , orozco _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite carried out an experiment to study the nonclassical properties of the radiation in an optical cavity that contains n two - level atoms in a strong coupling regime , where the atomic spontaneous emission rate into modes other than the resonant cavity mode is much greater than the damping rate of the cavity radiation , and found that the generated light exhibits squeezing .",
    "most recently , entanglement of atoms with radiation has been considered by various authors @xcite and encouraging results have been obtained .    nowadays ,",
    "correlated quantum systems of atoms or radiations or atom(s ) with a radiation have gained a considerable importance in connection with the potential role they are envisioned to play in the fields of quantum information and measurements beyond quantum limit . in the quantum information theory ,",
    "the issue of mapping the quantum states of the carrier ( light ) onto the quantum states of the storing device ( atoms ) is one of the essential problems that are not completely resolved at present .",
    "the mechanism of employing atomic ensembles to momentarily store quantum states of light via entanglement can serve as a device for interfacing the photonic quantum memories with processors .",
    "atom - radiation entanglement is not only crucial for many applications in the long range quantum communications , but also it is the key element to give the final answer to the einestein - podolsky - rosen s @xcite question on the real properties of nature , which they argued that there is inconsistencies between quantum theories and their idea of local and deterministic descriptions of nature @xcite . in this regard ,",
    "there is a proposal that involves mapping of a state of propagating quantum correlated light onto an atomic ensemble , which is relevant for the storage of the entanglement in the state of the light @xcite .",
    "moreover , as recently shown by andre and lukin @xcite , based on the analogy of the optical parametric oscillation to the process that transfers pairs of atoms from the lower level to a well defined final upper level , there is quantum correlations among the atomic states .    in relation to the importance of the issue",
    ", there are abundant works in the literature that address the possible mechanisms for generating entanglement in radiation modes @xcite and in an ensemble of atomic systems @xcite .",
    "besides , there is an evidence which indicates that the entanglement between atoms in the same ensemble is potentially applicable in the precession measurements @xcite .",
    "the interaction among atoms through exchange of photons is found to be responsible for the entanglement and spin squeezing that are characterized by the reduced fluctuations in an observable with an increased fluctuations in the canonical conjugate just like entanglement and squeezing in the radiation @xcite . on the other hand , as thoroughly discussed by walser _",
    "_ @xcite the method of mapping the state of a single quantized cavity mode adiabatically onto a finite dimensional sub - manifold of a two - level atom that passes through the resonator can be formulated using angular momentum operator .",
    "but , the first time analysis and observation of entanglement between the polarization of a single photon and the internal state of a single neutral atom stored in an optical dipole trap during the spontaneous emission is reported by votz _",
    "_ @xcite .    in this contribution",
    ", we seek to investigate the mechanism that establishes the atom - radiation entanglement analytically .",
    "to achieve our goal , we consider the correlation created between atoms and cavity radiation due to the spontaneous emission from the two - level atoms initially prepared in the upper level and then placed in a cavity , which is called as spontaneously induced atom - radiation entanglement .",
    "we take the cavity to be of a nonleaky type , since the present state - of - the - art cavity qed experiments are very close to such a limit @xcite .",
    "one may expect that the strong correlation between the modes in the squeezed radiation can create additional correlation between the atomic states and radiation in the cavity , and hence leads to enhancement of atom - radiation entanglement . in connection to this ,",
    "hald _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite demonstrated the possibility for mapping a quantum state of free propagating squeezed light onto a multi - atom ensemble as proposed by kuzmich _",
    "_ @xcite applying the spin polarization of cesium atoms in excited state . in accordance to this",
    ", we investigate the entanglement between the quantum state of an ensemble of two - level atoms with the cavity radiation using the schweninger s representation of the angular momentum in terms of the boson operators employing the approach recently introduced @xcite based on the criterion set by duan _",
    "we also study the photon statistics of the cavity as well as the emitted radiation .",
    "we , in particular , evaluate the quadrature variances of the cavity radiation , mean photon number available in the cavity , mean photon number emitted by the atoms , amount of the atom - radiation entanglement , and photon number distribution of the cavity radiation .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the interaction of two - level atoms with a single - mode cavity radiation has been derived by several authors @xcite based on jaynes - cummings model . as clearly indicated , for example , in the work of brecha _ et al . _",
    "@xcite this interaction hamiltonian , in the rotating - wave and electric - dipole approximations , can be expressed as @xmath0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the coupling constant that measures the strength of the interaction between the radiation and atoms , @xmath2 represents the cavity radiation , whereas @xmath3 are the collective atomic operators @xcite that are expressible in schweninger s representation of the angular momentum operators in terms of the usual boson operators as @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 correspond to the atoms in the lower and upper levels . then , making use of eqs . and the interaction of two - level atoms with a single - mode cavity radiation can be described by the quantum hamiltonian of the form @xmath8.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is a well - known fact that the differential equations following from a trilinear hamiltonian are nonlinear and hence difficult to analytically solve directly . as a result , in present work",
    "we consider the case when almost all the atoms are prepared to be initially in the upper level to overcome this problem . in this case",
    ", it is justifiable to treat the operator @xmath7 as a c - number @xmath9 which is taken to be real - positive constant @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this approximation the hamiltonian reduces to @xmath10,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath11 . in principle , it is possible to study the quantum features of such an interaction by solving the differential equations following from the pertinent heisenberg or quantum langevin equations .",
    "however , in this contribution we wish to exploit the advantageous conferred by the quasi - probability distribution functions .",
    "it is a well - established fact that the q - function can be defined for a two - mode cavity radiation initially in squeezed state as @xmath12 in which @xmath13 is the evolution operator corresponding to the interaction hamiltonian and @xmath14 is the initial state of the cavity radiation , where @xmath15 is the squeeze parameter . upon introducing the two - mode completeness relation for coherent states , @xmath16 , and the fact that @xcite @xmath17,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we come up with @xmath18,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the coherent - state propagator for a two - mode radiation .    following the method introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and latter employed in studying degenerate parametric oscillator @xcite , the coherent - state propagator pertinent to the hamiltonian is found to be @xmath20.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] upon inserting eq . into and",
    "then carrying out the resulting integrations , we get @xmath21.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we notice that @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent the cavity radiation and atomic properties , respectively .",
    "next , integrating over atomic variables shows that @xmath24\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the q - function is normalized , we realize that eq .",
    "entirely corresponds to the cavity radiation .",
    "moreover , it is not difficult to note that in the absence of the coupling of the atoms with the radiation , @xmath25 , @xmath26,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the q - function of the squeezed radiation alone , but when there is no squeezed vacuum radiation , @xmath27 , we see that @xmath28,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which represents the radiation that would have been emitted spontaneously from two - level atoms in high - fitness cavity .",
    "it is known for long that such a q - function is associated with a radiation in a chaotic state with a mean photon number of @xmath29 .    on the other hand , carrying out the integration over atomic variables indicates that @xmath30^{1\\over2}\\notag\\\\&\\times \\exp \\left[-{1 \\over\\cosh^{4}\\lambda t-\\tanh^{2}r}\\right.\\notag\\\\&\\times\\left.\\left[\\beta^{*}\\beta\\big(\\cosh^{2}\\lambda t-\\tanh^{2 } r\\big ) \\right.\\right.\\notag\\\\&\\left.\\left.+{\\tanh r\\sinh^{2}\\lambda t \\over2}\\left(\\beta^{*^{2}}+\\beta^{2}\\right)\\right]\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in view of the previous discussion this q - function describes the dynamical evolution of the atomic properties in relation to the population in the lower level .",
    "we notice that eq .",
    "reduces for @xmath27 to @xmath31.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is possible to note that eq",
    ". stands for a quantum system in a chaotic state in which the pertinent mean photon number is @xmath29 .",
    "however , it is not difficult to observe that for @xmath27 and @xmath25 the radiation in the cavity is in a coherent state ( vacuum ) .",
    "moreover , comparing eqs . and reveals that the radiation in the cavity and atomic properties in the absence of the squeezed radiation are represented by the same q - function , since the source of the cavity radiation is the spontaneous emission .",
    "the squeezing properties of a single - mode radiation can be described in terms of the quadrature operators @xmath32 and @xmath33 the variances of these operators can be put in the anti - normal order in the form @xmath34 so that we readily employ the q - function to obtain the expectation values of different moments involved in eq . .",
    "to this end , one can show using eq .",
    "that @xmath35 as a result of which the mean photon number of the cavity radiation turns out to be @xmath36     and different values of @xmath15 . , height=226 ]    it is clearly indicated in fig .",
    "1 as well as eq . that the mean of the photon number of the cavity radiation increases with the squeeze parameter and interaction time .",
    "we realize that as time progresses much of the atoms initially in the upper level would have a chance to decay to the lower level and subsequently emit a radiation .",
    "we also observe that a significantly intense light can be generated from this system provided that the atoms are allowed to stay in the cavity for sufficiently long period of time .",
    "moreover , applying eq .",
    "once again , it is possible to verify that @xmath37 @xmath38 hence on the basis of eqs .",
    ", , , and , we arrive at @xmath39     and different values of @xmath15 . , height=226 ]    it is not difficult to notice from eq . for @xmath27 that the squeezing does not exist , which indicates that the squeezing in the radiation is directly attributed to the squeezed radiation , since the squeezing of the cavity radiation is found to be maximum at @xmath40 , that is , before the interaction with the atom is initiated . as clearly shown in fig .",
    "2 the degree of squeezing of the cavity radiation of an ensemble of two - level atoms initially prepared to be in the upper level and placed in a squeezed vacuum increases with the squeeze parameter , but deceases with the interaction time . as we have discussed earlier the",
    "more the atoms are allowed to stay in the cavity , the more probable that each atom undergoes spontaneous emission . on the other hand , as previously reported by various authors @xcite and as well shown in sec .",
    "v , the spontaneously emitted radiation from an ensemble of two - level atoms exhibits chaotic nature . as a result , unfortunately , the interaction of the two - level atoms with the squeezed radiation in the cavity destroys the existing squeezing .",
    "the story would have been different , had the atomic coherence would have been induced either by initially preparing the atoms in the superimposed state of the upper and lower levels or coupling the two levels externally by a coherent light , since the induced atomic coherence initiates additional correlation .",
    "one of the most interesting and intriguing ideas associated with a composite quantum system is entanglement .",
    "a pair of particles is , basically , taken to be entangled in quantum theory if its states can not be expressed as a product of the states of its individual constituents .",
    "the preparation and manipulation of these entangled states that have nonclassical and nonlocal properties may lead to a better understanding of the basic quantum phenomena .",
    "it is in this conviction that we seek to consider the entanglement of the cavity radiation and atomic variables in this section . in other words , it is a well - established fact that a quantum system is said to be entangled , if it is not separable .",
    "that is , if the density operator for the combined state can not be expressed as a combination of the product density operators of the constituents , @xmath41 it is now available in literature that entangled continuous variable states can be expressed as a co - eigenstate of a pair of epr - type operators such as @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the total variance of these two operators reduces to zero for maximally entangled continuous variable states . since the cavity radiation and atomic properties",
    "are represented in equal footing with boson operators and the q - function is gaussian in nature , it is possible to employ the criterion set by duan _",
    "@xcite earlier .",
    "according to this criterion , quantum states of the composite system are entangled provided that the sum of the variances of a pair of epr - like operators @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , are quadrature operators for mode @xmath50 and @xmath51 , satisfy @xmath52 in which @xmath53    in the following , we determine the remaining correlation functions involved in eq . . to this end , with the aid of eq .",
    "it is possible to see that @xmath54 which represents the atomic population in the lower level .",
    "we know that each atom emits a radiation while decaying from the upper to lower level , in which eq . can be interpreted as the mean photon number of the emitted radiation .",
    "we notice that just like the mean number of the cavity radiation , the mean number of the emitted photons also increases with the squeeze parameter and interaction time .",
    "in addition , it is not difficult to see that @xmath55 this corresponds to the mean photon number of the squeezed radiation in the cavity , since upon subtracting the emitted photons from the cavity radiation one remains with the squeezed radiation in the cavity . in the same way ,",
    "it is possible to readily verify that @xmath56 @xmath57 on the other hand , the correlation between the states of the cavity radiation and atoms is found using eq . to be @xmath58 therefore , on account of eqs .",
    ", , , , , and , we reach at @xmath59     and different values of @xmath15 .",
    ", height=226 ]    it is clearly indicated in fig .",
    "3 that there can be a strong atom - radiation entanglement when an ensemble of two - level atoms initially prepared to be in the upper level are placed in a cavity containing a squeezed radiation .",
    "we see that the entanglement decreases with the squeeze parameter and consequently a strong entanglement is observed in the absence of the squeezing in the cavity , contrary to the usual expectation .",
    "this is mainly related to the phase competition in the quadrature fluctuations . as can readily be inferred from eqs .",
    "and the correlations leading to the squeezing and entanglement are different , so is the contribution of the squeezed radiation towards establishing entanglement and squeezing .",
    "this in turn corresponds to the fact that while the correlation between similar states results squeezing , but it is the correlation among different states alone which is responsible for entanglement .",
    "it is due to this underlying physical mechanism that though the squeezed radiation is directly accountable for the squeezing of the cavity radiation , it significantly destroys the atom - radiation entanglement .",
    "we also observe that the entanglement is found to be strong for a particular time corresponding to the coupling constant and squeeze parameter .",
    "moreover , the maximum entanglement occurs for smaller time when larger values of the squeeze parameter is used provided that the coupling constant is fixed . a difference between entanglement and squeezing properties is also observed in a down conversion process , where a correlation among similar states of the radiation contributes to the squeezing @xcite . however , for nondegenerate three - level scheme it is found that there is a direct relation between similar states in correlated emission laser is zero due to the assumption that the atoms are taken to be independent @xcite .",
    "the photon number distribution for a single - mode cavity radiation can be expressed in terms of the pertinent q - function as @xmath60 in which inserting eq . into and then carrying out the resulting differentiation reveals that @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "now , with the aid of the condition @xmath63 and the fact that factorials are defined for nonnegative integers , we obtain @xmath64^{2}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath65 should be even . following a straight forward calculations eq .",
    "is found to reduce , in the absence of the squeezed radiation , to @xmath66 this is the photon number distribution of the radiation that would have been emitted spontaneously from two - level atoms .",
    "we see from eq . that for @xmath27 , @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , eq . indicates that the spontaneously emitted radiation from an ensemble of two - level atoms prepared initially in the upper level and placed in the cavity initially maintained at a vacuum state is in a chaotic state , which is consistent with earlier reports @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the interaction of an ensemble of two - level atoms initially prepared in the upper level and placed in a cavity containing a squeezed radiation with a cavity radiation is presented .",
    "the squeezing as well as the statistical properties of the cavity radiation is thoroughly studied . on the basis of the fact that the spontaneously emitted radiation is found to be in the chaotic state ,",
    "the squeezing of the cavity radiation decreases with time of interaction .",
    "it is a well established fact that the longer the time of interaction , the more would be the intensity of the radiation in a cavity .",
    "but , unfortunately , the cavity radiation completely losses its squeezing properties in case when intense light can be generated .",
    "we , hence , can not see the utility of this system as a source of a squeezed light as usually expected @xcite .",
    "the photons emitted spontaneously by an ensemble of two - level atoms are uncorrelated .",
    "however , the result in sec .",
    "iv clearly shows that there is a significant correlation between the emitted photons and the atoms though the exchange of the spontaneously emitted radiation .",
    "this correlation is sufficiently strong to warrant atom - radiation entanglement .",
    "we find that this entanglement depends on the time of interaction .",
    "the entanglement becomes large at a particular time that depends on the squeeze parameter and coupling constant .",
    "we also observe that the squeezing of the radiation destroys the atom - radiation entanglement contrary to our expectation that due to the correlation initiated by squeezing the entanglement would have increased .",
    "we believe that this effect of the squeezed radiation may be related to the phase competition in the quadrature fluctuations .",
    "the controversy in the fact that the squeezed radiation is completely responsible for cavity squeezing although it degrades entanglement is associated with the difference in correlation that leads to these quantum features of the radiation .",
    "the same effect of the squeezed radiation is recently seen in harmonic entanglement of a driven degenerate parametric oscillator when the cavity is coupled to the squeezed vacuum reservoir @xcite .        1 w. krammers and w. h. heisenberg , z. phys . *",
