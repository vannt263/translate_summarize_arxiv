    "the unique electronic properties of single - walled carbon nanotubes ( swnts ) | related to their unusual band structures  @xcite|have attracted great attention in fundamental and applied research because of the possibility of exploring phenomena unique to one - dimensional systems .",
    "@xcite defectless swnts are well characterized both theoretically and experimentally | however , the presence of defects or tube endings is in fact crucial for the observation of quantum mechanical coherence phenomena .",
    "@xcite in this respect , scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy ( stm / sts ) represents a powerful instrument of investigations .",
    "this is an unparalleled tool able to measure the local electronic properties of swnts and correlate these with the atomic structure of the tube .",
    "thanks to this technique , it has been possible to visualize friedel oscillations  @xcite and quasi - bound - states  @xcite in metallic swnts .",
    "these articles , reconstructing the low - energy scattering spectrum of swnts , have routinely shown the presence of an asymmetry in the scattering properties of left- and right - moving electrons .",
    "however , only in the work by ouyang  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite there is an attempt to explain this asymmetry by relating it to the nature of defects .",
    "their general conclusion is that this asymmetry roots in the different symmetry properties of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands in the armchair swnt compared to the symmetry of defects .",
    "the dv defect in panel ( a ) ( type i ) is symmetric with respect to an exchange of the two carbon atoms a and b in each unit cell of the honeycomb lattice , whereas for the dv defect in panel ( b ) ( type ii ) this symmetry is broken . in panel",

    "we show how the scattering properties are altered when fundamental symmetries of swnts , as the pseudo - spin symmetry and particle - hole symmetry ( phs ) , are broken by the defects .",
    "in particular we focus on _ di - vacancy _ ( dv ) and stone - wales ( sw ) defects ( c.f",

    "these are prevalently observed in graphene and swnts ,  @xcite however our approach is quite general and can be extended to other types of defects .",
    "we show that pseudo - spin symmetry is determining the active scattering channels .",
    "further , contrary to the hypothesis by ouyang  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite , we substantiate that the experimentally observed asymmetry of electron scattering arises from the breaking of phs caused by the reconstruction of the chemical bond between carbon atoms at the defect site .",
    "phs breaking is also at the origin of other experimental observations  @xcite unexplained so far .",

    "simulations  @xcite and experiments  @xcite indicate that dvs are likely the prevailing defect - type in swnts and graphene .",

    "two distinct reconstruction hopping elements @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) are introduced into the hamiltonian @xmath19 .    in general a defect can give rise to three different types of scattering processes [ c.  f.  fig .",
    "[ fig : two](b ) ] : inter - valley forward / backward ( intervf / b ) and intra - valley backward ( intravb ) . however , only intervb processes are pseudo - spin conserving .    in the following",

    "the sw defects intrinsically include a lattice reconstruction | therefore phs is broken by its very nature . for an infinite swnt",
    "there is a degeneracy for the sw defect related to clockwise and anti - clockwise rotations of the c - c bond . in order to correctly describe these defects , we introduce a symmetrized hamiltonian accounting for both configurations .",
    "this hamiltonian commutes with the pseudo - spin symmetry operator @xmath20 , therefore also in this case the pseudo - spin @xmath2 is a good quantum number .",
    "indeed , we find by using method a that also for the sw hamiltonian only scattering processes conserving the pseudo - spin are allowed [ fig .",

    "we investigate | only within method b | a ( 10,10 ) armchair swnt with two reconstructed type i and ii dv defects ( @xmath38 ) placed at a distance of @xmath54  nm along the swnt axis . since @xmath34 , phs is already broken .",
    "four unequal combinations can be formed from the two type i and ii defects | however we consider here only two relevant cases as depicted in the insets of fig .",

    "[ fig : five](a ) ] resembles those of a single type i dv defect shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : four](b ) .",
    "we observe , however , a discretization in energy indicating the formation of quasi - bound - states between the defects . the pseudo - spin - selection rule for type i dv defects accounts for the fact that those bound states are essentially only formed by @xmath55 states as the asymmetry in the amplitude between the different linear slopes clearly shows .",
    "figure  [ fig : five](b ) contains one type ii dv defect that breaks the pseudo - spin symmetry|now intervf and intravb scattering occur .",
    "the fingerprint of the intervf processes are the vertical lines at @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the intravb scattering is revealed by the dispersive features at @xmath53 .",
    "we now apply these findings to interpret the experimental results of ouyang  _ et  al .",
    "_  @xcite and lee  _ et  al .",
    "_  @xcite . in the first work the scattering at a single isolated defect in an armchair swnt is analyzed .",
    "the reconstructed energy spectrum shows a selection rule of intervb scattering processes with respect to the pseudo - spin . in view of our results",

    "the standing waves of electrons scattered at one end of a nanotube peapod are examined .",
    "also in this case a clear asymmetry in the scattering processes is found .",
    "we can relate this asymmetry to the peapod at the tube end .",
    "there various hexagons of the lattice structure are replaced by pentagons therefore mixing the two sub - lattices of the swnt as in the case of the dv and sw defects .",
    "thus the breaking of phs explains the asymmetry observed experimentally . in the experiments by buchs",
    "_ et  al . _",
    "@xcite the quasi - bound - states in defected metallic swnt were investigated . there",
    "the defects were constituted mainly by dvs created by means of ions irradiation  @xcite . in order to make a comparison we have analyzed the case of two dv defects in two possible spatial configurations .",
    "also in this case we have observed an absence of processes that are not conserving the pseudo - spin in the case of two defects type i. for the second configurations where processes not conserving pseudo - spin are allowed , the numerical outcome accounts quite well for the experimental results .",
    "density plot of the fourier transformed local density of states as a function of the exchanged momentum and energy for the case of two 585 dv defects with @xmath38 . in panel",
    "( a ) we consider two type i dv defects , in panel ( b ) two type i and type ii dv defects .",
    "the signal at @xmath58  nm@xmath59 is associated with @xmath60 , the smallest length scale of the armchair swnt along the @xmath61-axis . ]    summarizing these finding we recognized two main features affecting the electron scattering at defects in the lattice structure of an armchair swnt : the conservation of the pseudo - spin degree - of - freedom , and the breaking of phs due to the lattice reconstruction .",
    "the former determines the active scattering channels , the latter introduces an asymmetry among the different scattering processes .",
    "the methods we have introduced here can also be employed to study defects in graphene and chiral swnts . in the latter case ,",
    "the pseudo - spin is in general not conserved .",
    "however , the breaking of phs due to the lattice reconstruction is a general feature of the underlying swnt honeycomb lattice and does not depend on the tube chirality .",
    "choosing the symmetry of the defect accordingly , it is possible to modify the ratio of the transmission probabilities of the two pseudo - spin species .",
    "therefore , the prospect of engineering definite defects in swnts , would permit to filter electrons with a specific degree - of - freedom | the pseudo - spin | in analogy to a similar effect on valley - spin induced by line defects in graphene  @xcite .    as we have shown with our results , the pseudo - spin dependent scattering response changes considerably with the electron energy .",
    "moreover , different defects can be combined in a line , so as we have demonstrated , in order to obtain an enhanced effect of filtering . therefore , by an opportune defect sequencing and by fixing the appropriate energy it should be possible to select the desired pseudo - spin in a controlled way .",
    "the problem of engineering well defined defects , _",
    "e.g. _ via ion irradiation , can be overcome by employing adatoms instead of dv and sw defects .",
    "these can be placed on the swnts with an atomic precision using , _",
    "e.g. _ the tip of a stm .",
    "in fact , adatoms break phs in the same manner as the dv and sw defects by allowing hopping between @xmath0 electrons of carbon atoms of the same sub - lattice@xcite .",
    "in proximity of the charge neutrality point the energy spectrum of armchair swnts can be approximated by two linearly dispersing branches centered around the two valleys @xmath62 , where @xmath63  nm is the c - c bond length ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : two ] ) . in this approximation",
    "the electronic wave function can be expressed as @xcite @xmath64 here @xmath65 is the valley index , @xmath66 is the momentum relative to @xmath67 , and @xmath2 is the pseudo - spin .",

    "[ fig : one]a ) .    within fermi s golden rule approximation ,",
    "the transition probability between different states @xmath21 is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 are the energies of the initial and final states , respectively .",
    "the local density of states ( ldos ) has been evaluated numerically via the retarded green s functions @xmath82 here @xmath83 is the hamiltonian of the defected swnt , and @xmath84 are the self - energies of the right or left lead , respectively .",
    "they have been determined by a recursive green s function method .",

    ", we have performed a convolution of @xmath10 with a function of the form @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the distance of a fictitious tip of a stm from the carbon atom at @xmath61 , and @xmath90 is an opportune constant .",
    "in our case the pseudo - spin operator @xmath20 is given by the pauli matrix @xmath91 .",
    "in general , electron scattering is pseudo - spin conserving if the defect hamiltonian commutes with @xmath20 . since the effect of @xmath20 is only a simultaneous exchange of the two carbon atoms of the unit cell , see fig .",
    "[ fig : one](a ) , pseudo - spin is conserved if and only if the defect geometry is symmetric with respect to an exchange of the a and b atoms within the single unit cells .",
