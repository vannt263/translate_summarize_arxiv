    "<S> the conventional treatment of lattice vibrations by frequency - independent density - functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) @xcite is inadequate for capturing the essentially dynamic nature of the coupled plasmon - phonon modes , and we therefore implement a fully _ dynamic _ approach treating the electron - hole , plasmon , and phonon elementary excitations on the equal footing @xcite .    our _ ab initio _ calculations for monolayer graphene employ the full - potential linear augmented plane - wave ( fp - lapw ) code elk @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> both modes are blue - shifted compared with the apl and oph , respectively . for larger @xmath46 ( upper panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ exyz ] ) , the frequency of apl becomes too high for ions to follow the oscillations , leading to the coupled mode convergence to the apl .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-polarized mode remains practically non - dispersive and , acquiring a finite but small line - width , is pinned at the position of the corresponding oph .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ w ] , we plot the energy absorbed by the unit cell of the lattice per unit time . </S>",
    "<S> the remarkable feature in this figure is that , depending on the frequency range , the lattice either receives the energy ( positive @xmath47 ) or gives it away to the electronic subsystem ( negative @xmath47 ) . we anticipate that this phenomenon will be experimentally observable in two - terminal suspended graphene experiments . </S>",
    "<S> for example , yien _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite recently demonstrated the ability to distinguish electronic from phononic heat conduction in a self - heated suspended device . </S>",
    "<S> the associated analysis of electron - phonon scattering did not , however , include plasmonic effects , which would be observable at moderate temperatures and under ac fields near the resonances predicted here . </S>",

    "<S> figure  [ cpldisp ] , right panel , shows the @xmath46-vector dispersion derived from the ions oscillations amplitude dependence on the frequency ( left panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude , that at smaller @xmath46-vectors , the acoustic - like linear dispersion of the coupled mode is lost , indicating that in this regime apl in graphene is an artefact of the frozen - lattice approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the second branch of the coupled mode remains close and above the @xmath1-polarized oph , varying non - monotonically and eventually converging to the latter .    in conclusion , we have implemented a fully dynamic ( frequency - dependent density - functional perturbation theory ) calculation of coupled electron - lattice oscillations in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the coupled mode behaves quite differently from the individual phonon and acoustic plasmon modes , previously known in graphene , and the former replaces the two latter , as acoustic plasmons and phonons do not exist in graphene by themselves , but they constitute a unified excitation of the electronic and ionic subsystems . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling provides a mechanism for the transfer of energy between the electronic subsystem and the lattice , which is shown to go in both directions depending on the frequency range . from this </S>",
