    "the conjecture for the existence of dark matter dates back to zwicky in 1933 , who failed to explain the dynamics of coma cluster by the virial theorem through the distribution of visible matter @xcite . to interpret the dynamics of the structure , the concept of missing mass or dark matter entered the astrophysical studies since then .",
    "in addition to the cosmological scales , in the smaller galactic scales , the flat rotation curve of the spiral galaxies requires the existence of the dark matter halo @xcite . on the other hand studying the dynamics of the universe as a whole reveals that the universe is dominated by the dark matter and dark energy @xcite .",
    "this hypothetical matter neither emits light nor interacts with the ordinary matter and only shows its presence through its gravitational interaction .",
    "the advantage of the cold dark matter ( @xmath0 ) model is that , it can successfully explain the rotation curve of the spiral galaxies and lensing by galaxies and cluster of galaxies . within the framework of general relativity ( gr ) it also provides a reasonable description for the hierarchy in the structure formation .",
    "although currently @xmath0 and @xmath1 models are remarkably successful in large scales @xcite , they can not explain tully - fisher and freeman laws @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the high - resolution n - body simulations are still in contradiction with the observations on sub - galactic scales where they predict orders of magnitude more substructures than what is observed @xcite .",
    "they also provide incompatible spatial distribution of the sub - halos @xcite .",
    "the other alternative to the dark matter is the modification to the gravity law by means of taking a generic form of action for the gravity rather than that of the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "this approach has been introduced to be an alternative model to the dark energy @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 gravity also is used to interpret the rotation curve of the spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "there is also recent efforts on modifying the gravity law by using a simple kinetic lagrangian whether the pressure can bend space - time sufficiently to replace the roles of dark energy , cold dark matter and heavy neutrinos in explaining anomalous accelerations at all scales @xcite .",
    "halle et al ( 2008 ) also proposed a generalized lagrangian with non - uniform cosmological constant for the vacuum field within the framework of the einstein gravity .",
    "finally the third approach , which we are concerned with in this work is the modification of the conventional newtonian law is so - called modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) .",
    "the dynamics of a structure in mond under the gravitational field is given by @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the newtonian gravitational acceleration , @xmath5 is a fundamental acceleration parameter and @xmath6 is a function for the transition from the newtonian to the mondian regime ( e.g. @xmath7 ) .",
    "the dynamics of the structure for @xmath8 deviates from the newtonian law by @xmath6 and for @xmath9 we recover the newtonian dynamics ( i.e. @xmath10 ) . on the other hand for @xmath11 , so - called deep mond regime , @xmath12 and the effective acceleration is given by @xmath13 .",
    "due to confusion in the definition of the dynamical concepts in mond , this model can be interpreted as a modification to the gravity law instead of dynamics .",
    "bekenestein and milgrom ( 1984 ) used a non - conventional newtonian action for the gravity to extract the modified poisson equation as follows : @xmath14 = 4\\pi g \\rho , \\label{mond2}\\ ] ] where in the spherical symmetric systems this equation reduces to equation ( [ mond ] ) .",
    "one of the problems with mond is that it is not a covariant gravity model .",
    "bekenestein ( 2004 ) proposed a covariant formulation of this model .",
    "this theory in addition to the metric has a scalar field as well as a 4-vector field called teves , where in the limit of non - relativistic , small accelerations , the field equation reduces to that in mond .",
    "the total potential in this theory is given by the sum of the newtonian potential @xmath15 and the potential due to the scalar field , @xmath16 : @xmath17 where the added scalar field plays the role of the dark matter .",
    "teves theory has also a newtonian limit for the non - relativistic dynamics with significant acceleration . in the non - relativistic limit",
    "we can simplify the gravity inside the spherical system as @xmath18 the advantage of mond is that it could provide a successful fit to the rotation curve of spiral galaxies and dispersion velocity of elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "it has been tested against the cosmic background radiation @xcite , gravitational lensing @xcite , stellar systems and galactic dynamics @xcite , solar system @xcite and tully - fisher and freeman laws @xcite .",
    "mond also decreases the mass discrepancy in the cluster of galaxies @xcite but yet in clusters it remains necessary to invoke the undetected matter , possibly in the form of a massive neutrino @xcite .",
    "studying the cosmology and formation of the large structures in the universe is another tool to examine mond . studying the mondian scenario of the structure formation",
    "has been started by felten ( 1984 ) and sanders ( 1998 ) . in the paper by sanders ( 1998 )",
    ", it is shown that a patch of universe in the mondian regime smaller than the horizon size can evolve with a different rate than the background , hence the structures naturally can be formed through this scale dependent dynamics . in this scenario",
    "small structures form before the larger ones and this provides a bottom - up hierarchical procedure for the formation of the structures in the universe .",
    "the problem with this model is that the center of collapse is not identified and every point in the space depending on the choice of the coordinate system can be considered as the center of the structure . for solving this problem one can consider mond formula to be applied to a peculiar acceleration developing from density fluctuation rather than hubble expansion @xcite .",
    "nusser ( 2002 ) used the amplitude of the cmb anisotropies as the initial condition in the n - body simulation to simulate the large scale structures in the universe .",
    "however to have a compatible result , one has to either decrease @xmath19 by one order of magnitude or reduce the amplitude of the fluctuations at the initial condition .",
    "recent studies in the formation of the galaxies by sanders ( 2008 ) shows that massive elliptical galaxies may be formed at @xmath20 , as a consequence of the monolithic dissipation - less collapse . applying mond with cooling mechanism put an upper limit to the stellar clustering in the form of the galaxy . extending",
    "the structure formation in teves theory has been done by linear perturbation of metric , vector and scalar fields .",
    "the predictions are compatible with the observations of the structures @xcite .",
    "skordis ( 2008 ) also used a generalized teves theory to construct the primordial adiabatic perturbations of a general family of the scalar field kinetic functions .    in this work",
    "we extend the spherical collapse model in mond for studying the general behavior of the structures during their formation .",
    "the initial baryonic density contrast for the structures is taken from the cmb anisotropy .",
    "we obtain the dynamics of the baryonic structures in the early epoches with the linear newtonian structure formation until the entering of the structure to the mondian regime and follow the evolution with the mond . the dynamical evolution with mond shows that the structures virialize with power - law distribution of matter .",
    "we show that while all of the structures re - collapse and virialize in the mondian regime , the gravitational acceleration of the structures in this stage inversely depends on the size of the structure .",
    "this dynamical behavior of the structure formation is compatible with the less - existence of the dark matter in the globular clusters and central parts of the galaxies in cdm scenario .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section [ str ] we give a brief review of the spherical collapse model in mond and extend it by looking at the dynamics of each layer in the onion model . in section [ evol ]",
    "we discuss about the results of the calculation , showing that the density profile inside the structure is a time varying function during the evolution and the structure at the final stage , virialize from the center to the outer areas . in section [ conc ]",
    "we summarize and discuss the results .",
    "in this section we introduce the mondian cosmology and apply mond in the spherical collapse model for studying the formation of the structures . here",
    "we take the onion model for the spherical structure , dividing the sphere to the co - centric shells and studying the evolution of each layer separately and the structure as a whole .",
    "[ mondcos ] in the standard cosmology the dynamics of the universe in the matter dominated regime can be derived from the newtonian gravity .",
    "sanders ( 1998 ) used this approach to obtain the dynamics of universe in the mondian scenario .",
    "in modian cosmology , a patch of universe can evolve with a different rate than the background as soon as the acceleration fulfills the condition of @xmath8 .",
    "the result is dynamical decoupling of the smaller scales from the background which causes the production of the over dense regions in the universe .",
    "the reason for this feature of cosmological dynamics in mond is that unlike the newtonian mechanics , the acceleration in the comoving frame depends on the length scale .",
    "let us take a spherical region with radius @xmath21 from the background in which @xmath22 . using the newtonian dynamics the acceleration",
    "is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the active gravitational mass and to have a compatible relation with the relativistic results , we define it to be composed of the relativistic and non - relativistic matter as @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the density and pressure of the cosmic fluid .",
    "substituting equation ( [ mass ] ) in equation ( [ newt_equation ] ) , the acceleration is given by : @xmath28 in equation ( [ nc ] ) , the gravitational acceleration increases linearly with @xmath21 .",
    "this implies that there should be a critical radius @xmath29 where inside it the acceleration is smaller than the mond threshold @xmath30 and the dynamics is given by the mond where outside that radius it is newtonian .",
    "this critical length scale obtain by equaling the left hand side of equation ( [ nc ] ) with @xmath31 as @xmath32 this length scale separates the newtonian @xmath33 and the mondian @xmath34 domains . as the density of universe changes with the expansion of the universe , the critical radius also changes with time . from the continuity equation ,",
    "the matter and the radiation densities vary as @xmath35 and @xmath36 . using the definition of the critical density @xmath37 , equation ( [ rc ] )",
    "can be written in terms of the density parameters , @xmath38 , and the scale factor @xmath39 where we adapt @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "now we do comparison of the size of a structure with @xmath44 . from equation ( [ rc2 ] )",
    "the critical radius @xmath44 changes with the scale factor as @xmath45 in the radiation and @xmath46 in the matter dominant epoches . on the other hand",
    "the size of the structure is proportional to the scale factor ( i.e. @xmath47 ) .",
    "so we expect that the newtonian structures eventually will enter the mondian regime as @xmath44 grows faster than @xmath48 . using the adapted cosmological parameters ,",
    "the critical radius at the present time is obtained @xmath49 which means that the whole observable universe resides in a mondian domain . comparing these two length scales at the last scattering surface results in @xmath50 .",
    "the mass corresponding to this critical radius at last scattering surface is about @xmath51 and for @xmath52 the dynamics is given by mond .",
    "while we expect to have density contrast growth for the scales @xmath53 at the decoupling , comparing the critical mass @xmath54 with the jeans mass of @xmath55 at this time indicates that the structures at these scales should be washed out by the pressure @xcite .",
    "the other feature of mondian cosmology is that unlike the standard cosmology where decoupling redshift is smaller than the equality redshift ( @xmath56 ) , in mond the equality epoch is much after than the decoupling time .",
    "this feature results from this fact that decoupling is related to the baryonic density of the universe and the temperature and both parameters depend only on the scale factor , independent of the dynamics of the universe .",
    "so we expect to have the same decoupling redshift in the mond as the standard cosmology .",
    "however since the dark matter does not exist in the mondian cosmology , the equality will be shifted to the lower redshifts . for our adopted cosmological parameters the equality redshift",
    "is obtained @xmath57 .      in this part",
    "we model the evolution of a structure with an over - dense spherical region in mond . to calculate the evolution of this spherical patch , for simplicity",
    "we take this over - dense region with a top - hat distribution of matter .",
    "as the acceleration of this structure depends on the distance from the center , we expect to have different dynamics for each radius .",
    "hence , we divide the structure into the co - centric spherical shells like an onion model in cosmology @xcite and calculate the dynamics of each shell separately .",
    "the initial density contrast for this over - dense region is taken from the fluctuations of the last scattering surface . in the newtonian treatment of the structure formation @xmath58 ,",
    "the density contrast grows linearly @xmath59 from the decoupling epoch up to the entrance of the structure to @xmath44 . for the mondian regime @xmath60",
    ", we switch the dynamics to mond an calculate the evolution of the structure . as an example",
    "let us take a sphere with a mass of @xmath61 and find its acceleration with respect to the center . in figure (",
    "[ n - mond ] ) we compare the acceleration of this spherical structure in mondian and newtonian dynamics as a function of the redshift .",
    "we note that the redshift is defined according to the dynamics of the scale factor at the background . at the early epoches ,",
    "the difference between these two dynamics is small as @xmath62 , but after entering the structure to the mondian regime @xmath63 , the evolution of the structure by the newtonian dynamics and mond start to diverge .",
    "this deviation of the dynamics from that of newtonian plays the role of the dark matter in the standard scenario of the structure formation .    for calculating the dynamics of each shell in the onion model ,",
    "we take the following notation : @xmath64 is the radius of @xmath65th shell as a function of time and @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the entering time and radius of the @xmath65th shell to the mondian domain , respectively .",
    "the velocity of @xmath65th shell in terms of the hubble parameter at entrance time is given by @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the hubble parameter of the newtonian background and @xmath70 is the density contrast of the sphere enveloped by @xmath71 .",
    "as we discussed in the previous section , all the shells will eventually enter the mondian regime and we take this time as the initial condition for each shell in the mondian evolution of the structures . table ( [ tab1 ] ) shows the initial density contrast , radius and the corresponding redshift of the entrance of each shell to the mondian regime . in the mondian regime , the acceleration approximately is @xmath72 and the evolution of each shell is as follows : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the mass of the structure enveloped by the @xmath75 shell . using the initial conditions given by table ( 1 ) , we obtain the evolution of each shell as shown in figure ( [ r - g ] ) . to visualize the evolution of the shells , we divide the sphere into ten equidistant shells when all the structure is in the newtonian regime and obtain their evolution as a function of background redshift .",
    "the dynamics of shells shows that the inner shells evolve faster , reaching to a maximum radius and then collapse earlier than the outer ones . here",
    "the initial radius of outermost shell is about @xmath76 at the entrance time of @xmath77 to the mond regime .",
    "this shell expands up to a maximum radius of @xmath78 at @xmath79 .",
    "eventually , the shell starts to collapse and virialize at @xmath80 with the radius of @xmath81 .",
    "the maximum radius of each shell , @xmath82 , is obtained from integrating equation ( [ monddyn ] ) , letting @xmath83 as follows : @xmath84 the next phase of the evolution of shells after reaching to a maximum radius is re - collapsing .",
    "similar to the standard scenario of the spherical collapse models we expect that the global radial velocity of the structure during the free fall collapse convert to the dispersion velocity and prevent the structure from a catastrophic collapse .",
    "this steady stage of the structure is given by the virial theorem .",
    "the corresponding radius that fulfill the virial condition is called the virial radius and is calculated from : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the gravitational potential at the @xmath65th shell .",
    "the potential in the newtonian or mondian regimes is given by @xmath87 for the non - dissipative evolution of the structure , the total energy is conserved and we substitute the right hand side of equation ( [ vir ] ) by the energy of the system at the enterance time to the mondian regime , @xmath88 . using the potentials given by equation ( [ pot2 ] ) at the left hand side of the equation ( [ vir ] ) , the virial radius for the mond and newtonian regimes obtain as @xmath89 if the virialization of the structure takes place in the mondian regime , @xmath90 implies @xmath91 which results in @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the kinetic energy for a unit mass and @xmath94 .",
    "on the other hand if the structure virializes in the newtonian regime , @xmath95 condition from the equation ( [ vir2 ] ) implies @xmath96 .",
    "we calculate the expression of @xmath97 for each shell ( see table [ tab1 ] ) and show that all the shells of the structure virialize in the mondian regime ( i.e. @xmath98 ) .",
    "table ( [ tab2 ] ) shows the parameters of shells for the moment of maximum radius and the virialization stage and fig.([r - g ] ) visualizes quantitative behavior of the shells during their evolution . in this figure",
    "the spots on the evolution curves shows the two critical stages of the maximum radius and the virialization radius , reported in table ( [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "the evolution lines of the shells show that the inner shells evolve faster and virialize at the higher redshifts , while the outer shells evolve slower .",
    "in this section we discuss the evolution of the density contrast and the profile of matter distribution inside the structure .",
    "we use the definition of the density contrast of the shells in our model : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the density of @xmath65th shell and @xmath101 is the density of the background . as the collapsing of the shells starts from the inner to the outer parts of the structure , we will not have a shell crossing during the evolution of the structure and from the conservation of the mass , we can perform the jacobian transformation from the initial distribution of matter inside the sphere to the evolved distribution as follows : @xmath102 where @xmath103 represents the thickness of the @xmath104 shell . substituting the dynamics of each shell from the previous section in equation ( [ rho ] ) ,",
    "we obtain the evolution of density contrast for the shells up to the virialization stage as shown in figure ( [ dens ] ) .",
    "the inner shells evolve faster and reach the non - linear regime @xmath105 at the higher redshifts while the outer ones evolve slower .",

    "the mass of @xmath107 shows that the former structure enters the non - linear regime at @xmath108 while the later one becomes non - linear at @xmath109 .",
    "more details on the characteristic redshifts of the structures in terms of their masses is reported in table ( [ tab2 ] ) . from this table",

[ f4 ] ) : @xmath110 in what follows we describe the qualitative predictions of this simple model .      in this part",
    "we compare the evolution of the density profile of the structures in the spherical collapse model for the newtonian and mondian regimes . in the newtonian regime @xmath111",
    "we have seen that the dynamics of the shells in the structure depends only on time and transforming to a comoving frame , the dynamics is scale independent ( see equation [ nc ] ) .",
    "this means that the dynamics is invariant under the scale transformation and the result is preserving the initial profile of the structure . in mond @xmath112 , since the dynamics depends on the scale unlike the newtonian case the density profile will change with time . in fig .",

    "we continuously do jacobian transformation from this stage to the later times ( i.e. @xmath117 ) and obtain the density of each shell .",
    "while the structure evolve , the distance of shells change with time as shown with a point on the profile representing the position of each shell ( fig .",
    "[ dens - prof ] ) .",
    "as the inner shells enter to the mondian regime earlier we expect the density profile deviates from the homogeneous distribution .",
    "fig.([dens - prof ] ) shows a small deviation of the density profile from the homogenous one at @xmath118 . at this moment",
    "all the shells are in the mondian domain , however as the inner shells have been evolved faster , they are more dense than the outer shells .",
    "each shell after virialization freezes and preserves its density .",
    "we fit the density profile of the structure when the outermost shell , the latest part of the structure , virializes and the result is a power - law function of @xmath119 with the index of @xmath120 .",
    "+      a question that may be answered in this simple model is the dependence of the age of the structure to the mass .",
    "observations show that small isolated structures as the globular clusters or the center of galaxies are older than the spiral arms @xcite . in this model",
    "we have seen that the smaller structures enter the mondian regime earlier , evolve faster and virialize at the higher redshifts compared to the larger structures . as an example , in table ( [ tab2 ] ) it is shown that a structure with the mass of @xmath121 virializes at @xmath122 while the whole of galaxy virializes at @xmath123 .",

    "the other question in the formation of the structures is that why the smaller structures are mainly made of the baryonic matter and have a less dark matter compared to the larger ones .",
