    "event - by - event hydrodynamics with fluctuating initial conditions ( ic ) leads to better agreement with experimental data for particle spectra and elliptic flow of hadrons produced in heavy ion collisions than hydrodynamics with a smooth initial - state - averaged profile  @xcite .",
    "thermal photons with @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 are mostly emitted from the hot and dense early stage of the system expansion .",
    "they are thus especially suitable for probing ic fluctuations . for 020% central au+au collisions at rhic ,",
    "the thermal photon @xmath3 spectrum from fluctuating ic using ideal hydrodynamics is found to be about 10% flatter than the spectrum from smooth ic in the region @xmath4 gev/@xmath1 .",
    "consequently , it explains the phenix direct photon data better in that @xmath3 range  @xcite .",
    "we show that a systematic study of photon observables at different collision centralities and collision energies provides useful information about the density fluctuations and their size in the ic  @xcite .",
    "the event - by - event hydrodynamic framework developed in  @xcite is used here ( as in  @xcite ) to calculate the thermal photon @xmath3 spectra at different collision centralities at rhic and lhc energies as well as photon elliptic flow from fluctuating ic .",
    "this is a monte carlo glauber based model where the entropy density @xmath5 is distributed around the wounded nucleons ( wn ) in the transverse plane using a 2d gaussian function of the form @xmath6 here , the free parameter @xmath7 determines the fluctuation size .",
    "we use state of the art photon rates ( qgp and hadronic rates from  @xcite and  @xcite respectively ) to calculate the photon @xmath3 spectra at rhic and lhc energies for different collision centralities . the initial formation time @xmath8 of the plasma",
    "is taken as 0.17 and 0.14 fm/@xmath1 at rhic and lhc , respectively , from the ekrt model  @xcite .",
    "results from the fluctuating ic are obtained by taking a final state average of photon @xmath3 spectra from a sufficiently large number of random events . at different centrality",
    "bins the smooth ic is constructed by taking an initial - state average of 1000 fluctuating profiles , which essentially removes all the fluctuations from the interior of the fireball .",
    "the @xmath3 spectra of thermal photons from au+au collisions at rhic are shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig1 ] for three different centrality bins .",
    "the results from the smooth and fluctuating ic are obtained using fixed values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 for all the centrality bins .",
    "the enhancement in photon production due to ic fluctuations is found to be more pronounced for peripheral collisions than for central collisions , i.e. , the relative importance of the hotspots increases for peripheral collisions .",
    "the presence of even a few hotspots in the fluctuating ic enhance the photon production significantly as compared to the smooth ic as the photon yield falls rapidly towards peripheral collisions .",
    "similar to rhic , the effect of the ic fluctuations is also found to be stronger for peripheral collisions than for central collisions at the lhc .",
    "however , the relative enhancement is found to be less at the lhc than at rhic for the same centrality bin .",
    "the ratio of the thermal photon yield from the fluctuating and smooth ic at rhic and lhc energies for the 020% centrality bin is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig1 ] .",

    "a smaller @xmath8 leads to a larger initial temperature and more high @xmath3 photons from the plasma phase .",
    "however , the value of @xmath8 is not known precisely and it varies within a range of 0.17 to 0.60 fm/@xmath1 in different hydrodynamic calculations at rhic energy .",
    "we see that the @xmath3 spectra from smooth as well as from fluctuating ic fall sharply in the range @xmath4 gev/@xmath1 for all centrality bins when @xmath8 is changed from 0.17 fm to 0.60 fm/@xmath1 ( keeping the total entropy of the system fixed , see figure 4 in  @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the value of @xmath8 may not remain the same for different centrality bins .",
    "the system is more dilute for peripheral collisions and one can expect a larger @xmath8 there compared to central collisions .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig2 ] shows @xmath3 spectra of thermal photons at the lhc energy considering centrality dependent @xmath8 values ( calculated from a non - local version of the ekrt model  @xcite with @xmath11 ) and fixed @xmath8 for all centrality bins ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "a larger @xmath8 for peripheral collisions decreases the production compared to a smaller @xmath8 , whereas ic fluctuations increase the production .",
    "however , due to the uncertainties in the initial formation time it is difficult to conclude anything about the density fluctuations and their size in the ic by looking at the @xmath3 spectra alone .",

    "we define a quantity @xmath13 as  @xcite @xmath14 where the value of @xmath15 is changed from 10 to 70 in steps of 10 and @xmath16=@xmath15 + 10 in the following . for pqcd direct photons (",

    "@xmath17 is the number of binary collisions for a particular centrality bin .",

    "@xmath12 rises rapidly with collision centralities and a significant difference between the results from the smooth and fluctuating ic can be observed even for larger values of @xmath7 and @xmath8  @xcite .      the elliptic flow of direct photons is believed to be dominated by the flow contribution from thermal radiation up to @xmath20 gev/@xmath1 as the contributions from all other sources ( apart from thermal )",

    "we calculate the elliptic flow of thermal photons from event - by - event hydrodynamics with respect to the participant plane using the relation @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the participant plane angle  @xcite .",
    "the obtained @xmath23 from smooth and fluctuating ic at rhic for the 2040% centrality bin is shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "fluctuations in the initial density distribution lead to a larger transverse flow velocity and larger elliptic flow especially for @xmath24 gev/@xmath1 compared with a smooth profile .",

    "we see that at @xmath25 4 gev/@xmath1 , more that 80% of the photons are emitted before first one fm , however less than 10% of elliptic flow is developed by that time .",
    "in conclusion , the thermal photon @xmath3 spectra from smooth and fluctuating ic are compared for different collision centralities at the rhic and lhc energies .",
