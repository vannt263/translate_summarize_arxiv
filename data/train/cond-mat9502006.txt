    "several methods are presently available for performing _ ab initio _ calculations for solids .",
    "most frequently used is the density - functional method , with a local - density approximation ( lda ) for the exchange and correlation contributions to the total energy @xcite .",
    "this method yields good results for solid - state properties , on average , but a systematic improvement is difficult . in the past few years it has become possible to determine self - consistent - field ( scf ) calculations for solids using the exact non - local hartree - fock ( hf ) exchange @xcite . while the results are often inferior to lda because electron correlations are neglected , it has the advantage of yielding a well - defined mean - field wave - function , which can be used as a starting point for treating many - body effects . in the quantum monte carlo ( qmc )",
    "approach @xcite , one multiplies a mean field function ( slater determinante ) by a jastrow factor which explicitly introduces inter - electronic coordinates .",
    "another approach of incorporating electron correlation is the local ansatz ( la ) @xcite , where local operators acting on the scf wave - function are used to admix suitable one- and two - particle excitations to the mean - field ground state .",
    "a method closely related to the ideas of the la is the incremental expansion of the correlation energy ; here information on local excitations in clusters is made use of , which are accessible to an accurate quantum - chemical configuration interaction ( ci ) treatment . this way @xmath1 % of the correlation contribution to the cohesive energy @xmath2 has been recovered for diamond @xcite and crystalline silicon @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we extend the application of the method of increments to two more systems  germanium and grey tin  and to other properties beside @xmath2 : we determine , for all of the group iv semiconductors , the influence of electron correlation on the lattice constant @xmath3 and the bulk modulus @xmath4 .    in order to discuss the influence of correlation , we need reliable hf values for the ground state properties of these solids .",
    "we supplement the results of the torino group @xcite by cluster calculations which are described in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "we sketch the method of increments and report on computational details of the correlation treatment .",
    "the results for group iv semiconductors are discussed and compared with experiment and other calculations in section 4 .",
    "conclusions follow in section 5 .",
    "obtaining accurate hf energies for solids is still a difficult computational task .",
    "the torino group of pisani and co - workers developed a method which enables one to perform scf - lcao ( linear combination of atomic orbitals ) calculations for periodic systems @xcite .",
    "however , as a certain drawback of their program package crystal @xcite convergency problems are encountered , if one uses gaussian functions with small exponents as normally contained in molecular basis sets ; moreover , higher polarization functions than @xmath5 are presently not available .    another possibility for obtaining information on solids are cluster calculations .",
    "they do not account for the infinite extension of the solid , but one can use standard quantum chemical program packages for achieving high accuracy , without any restriction with regard to the basis set . in this paper",
    ", we use a cluster method in conjunction with an energy partitioning approach which was developed for diamond @xcite and is here extended to silicon , germanium and grey tin .",
    "the systems considered in this scheme are fragments of the diamond lattice , with dangling bonds saturated by hydrogen atoms .",
    "more specifically , one chooses clusters with closed structure where each of the x atoms ( x = c , si , ge , sn ) has at least two neighbouring x atoms . the smallest one which meets this condition is @xmath6 , the biggest one which was accessible in our calculations is @xmath7 .",
    "( all clusters of the present scf study are shown in fig . 1 . )",
    "the x - x distances were taken from the solid ( @xmath8=1.544  , @xmath9=2.352  , @xmath10=2.460  , @xmath11=2.810  ) @xcite , for the x - h bond lengths those of the corresponding @xmath12 molecule were used ( @xmath13=1.102  , @xmath14=1.480  , @xmath15=1.525  , @xmath16=1.711  ) @xcite .",
    "for carbon the correlation - consistent polarized valence double - zeta ( pvdz ) basis set ( 9s4p1d)/[3s2p1d ] of dunning @xcite was selected . for si ,",
    "ge and sn we employed 4-valence - electron pseudopotentials simulating the atomic cores , together with the corresponding optimized basis sets of double - zeta quality ( dz ) ( 4s4p)/[3s3p ] for the valence electrons @xcite ; we added one d - function in each case whose exponent was optimized in ci calculations for @xmath12 and @xmath17 ( si : 0.40 ; ge : 0.32 ; sn : 0.23 ) .",
    "for hydrogen we chose dunning s @xcite double zeta basis ( 4s)/[2s ] , without polarization function .",
    "we calculated the total hf energy @xmath18 for each cluster , using the direct scf program package turbomole @xcite of ahlrichs and co - workers . in order to obtain an estimate of that part of @xmath18 which can be attributed to a solid - like x atom of the cluster , surrounded only by x atoms , we employed the energy partitioning method of refs .",
    "@xcite : @xmath18 is approximated by a sum of energy contributions of the bare x atom , xh and @xmath19 groups @xmath20 where @xmath21 ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) are the numbers of atoms in the cluster with zero ( one , two ) neighbouring h atoms .",
    "we determined the quantities @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 by adjustment to the scf results @xmath18 of the three largest clusters ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "we checked the resulting values for the group energies using the total scf energies of the other clusters : the quantity @xmath29 in table 1 is the ( average ) difference of these energies to the values evaluated from the group contributions according to ( 1 ) .",
    "finally , the hf cohesive energy of the solid per unit cell was calculated from @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the scf energy of the free atom determined at the same level as @xmath24 ( i.e. using the same basis set ) , and @xmath32 is the number of atoms per unit cell ( 2 for the diamond lattice ) . the results for @xmath33 of the group iv semiconductors are listed in table 1 .",
    "the error @xmath29 gives an estimate for the finite size effect ; it is 3 % for sn and smaller for the other compounds .",
    "hartree - fock results from literature @xcite , calculated with crystal , are in good agreement ( to @xmath34 ) with our values for diamond and silicon ( although smaller primitive basis sets were used in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but there is a difference of 7 % for ge .",
    "in the following we give a derivation of the incremental expansion for the correlation energy which supplements the one given in refs .  @xcite",
    "; it is similar to the one proposed in ref .",
    "the present derivation is more formal , but it shows clearly that the method applies to infinite solids and should not be considered as being merely related to calculations for finite systems .",
    "we use thereby the cepa-0 ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) which is particularly suitable for our purpose .",
    "we start from a hamiltonian @xmath35 which can be divided into two parts @xmath36 the ground state of @xmath37 is supposed to be known ; in our case it is the hf ground state with the corresponding wave - function @xmath38 .",
    "we define a product of two operators @xmath39 and @xmath4 in the liouville space as follows : @xmath40 the upper script c indicates that the cumulant of the expectation value is taken , which is given by @xmath41 for further details see ref .",
    "@xcite . by using ( [ cumm ] )",
    "we may write the exact ground - state energy @xmath42 in the following way : @xmath43 where @xmath44 plays the role of the wave operator which describes the transformation from the hf ground state to the exact ground state .",
    "if we have a solid with well - defined bonds , we can express the hf ground state @xmath38 in terms of localized orbitals and label those orbitals by a bond index @xmath45 .",
    "we define operators @xmath46 , where i should being consider as a compact index which includes the bond i as well as the one and two particle excitations of bond @xmath45 , and @xmath47 , which describes the two particle excitations where one excitation is out of bond @xmath45 while the other is out of bond @xmath48 . within the restricted operator subspace spanned by @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    "we make for @xmath44 an ansatz of the form @xmath49 this choice represents the coupled electron pair approximation at level zero ( cepa-0 ) @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 are determined from the set of equations @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xcite . with ( [ omega ] )",
    "this implies @xmath54 the method of increments provides a scheme , in which this set of equations and hence the correlation energy is evaluated in a hierarchical order .",
    "* first all electrons are kept frozen except for the ones e.g. in bond @xmath45 .",
    "the operators @xmath46 describe the corresponding excitations of these two electrons and eq .",
    "( [ set ] ) reduce to @xmath55 within this approximation the @xmath56 are independent of each other and the correlation energy becomes @xmath57 with @xmath58 * in the next step we correlate the electrons in two bonds , e.g. @xmath45 and @xmath48 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath59 parameters are determined from the coupled equations @xmath60 again , the increments @xmath61 and @xmath62 are treated as independent of each other in this approximation , and we have @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65",
    "* analogously we calculate the three bond energy increment , which is defined as @xmath66 the correlation energy @xmath67 is that obtained when all electrons are kept frozen except those in bond @xmath45,@xmath48 and @xmath68 .",
    "again , the increments @xmath69 are treated as being independent of each other .",
    "the total correlation energy within this approximation is the sum of all increments .",
    "@xmath70 it is obvious that by calculating higher and higher increments the exact correlation energy within cepa-0 is obtained .",
    "the method just described is only useful if the incremental expansion is well convergent , i.e. if increments up to , say , triples are sufficient , and if increments become rapidly small with increasing distance between localized orbitals .",
    "these conditions were shown to be well met in the case of diamond and silicon @xcite , but have to be checked again for germanium and grey tin here .",
    "ideally the increments should be local entities not sensitive to the surroundings .",
    "we use this property to calculate the energy increments in finite clusters .",
    "if they can be proven to be well transferable even between finite clusters , such cluster calculations may be extrapolated to the corresponding solid state quantities .      in this section",
    "we give computational details characterizing our _ ab initio _",
    "calculations for the correlation energies of group iv semiconductors with diamond structure .",
    "first we select suitable fragments of the diamond lattice , and , as in the scf calculations , we saturate the dangling bonds with hydrogen .",
    "we have to take much smaller clusters , however , for the correlation treatment ( see fig .",
    "2 ) than in the scf case , because ci calculations for clusters as large as @xmath7 would be prohibitive .    as a second step",
    "we perform , for each cluster , a standard scf calculation ( using the program package molpro @xcite ) and localize the bond orbitals , applying the foster - boys criterion @xcite , within the occupied valence space in @xmath71 symmetry . following that we calculate cepa-0 energy increments by successively correlating more and more of the localized x - x bond orbitals ( lmo ) as described in the previous subsection .",
    "two different basis sets are used : basis set a is the same as in the scf calculations . an extended basis set",
    "b has been generated by replacing the single @xmath5 function of basis set a by a @xmath72 polarization set with an optimized @xmath73 exponent ( c : d : 1.0970 , 0.318 ; f : 0.76 ; si : d : 0.8 , 0.23 ; f : 0.35 ; ge : d : 0.6 , 0.15 ; f : 0.43 ; sn : d : 0.45 , 0.12 ; f : 0.30 ) . in order to check the quality of the basis sets we performed test calculations for the one - bond increment @xmath74 of the @xmath75 cluster ( table 2 ) .",
    "one sees that the @xmath76 basis set is well chosen ; enlarging the @xmath5 space and adding an additional @xmath73 function yields an enhancement of about 25% , supplying a polarisation set 3d2f1 g @xcite adds another 20% .",
    "next we have to check the transferability and the convergence of the increments .",
    "we will discuss them for sn since this is the most critical case .",
    "the correlation energy increments obtained for sn are listed in table 3 together with the weight factors appropriate for the solid .",
    "we observe the following :    * the convergence of the incremental expansion is quite rapid both with respect to the number of the bonds involved ( e.g. cluster 4 : @xmath77 ) and with respect to the distance between the bonds ( e.g. cluster 4 : @xmath78 ) . in view of these findings",
    ", we restrict the energy increments up to the third order for adjacent bonds and up to the second order for next nearest through third nearest neighbours . *",
    "the transferability of the increments is reasonably good .",
    "there are changes of @xmath79 a.u . for one - bond increments between the smallest ( @xmath80 ) and the largest ( @xmath81 ) clusters considered .",
    "for the most important two - bond increment the difference between @xmath82 and @xmath83 is about @xmath84 a.u .. as these changes are of different sign , the total effect on the cohesive energy of the solid is not larger than @xmath85 a.u .",
    "per unit cell .    finally , in order to test the quality of the cepa-0 results , we performed calculations for @xmath86 at different levels of correlation treatment ( table 4 ) .",
    "we tried cepa-1 and cepa-2 as well as the coupled cluster method with single and double excitations ( ccsd ) and even with additional triple excitations included in a perturbative way ( ccsd(t ) ) .",
    "the effect on the one - bond increment is of the order of @xmath87 a.u . , and @xmath88 a.u .",
    "for the two - bond increment .",
    "thus , the errors are of the same order of magnitude as those caused by lack of transferability .",
    "it is clear , from these remarks , that the accuracy of our method has its limitations , in practical applications . on the other hand ,",
    "there are formal arguments why errors due to the truncation of the incremental expansion should be small : higher than two - bond increments involve triple excitations which do not directly couple to the hartree - fock ground state ; two - bond increments between localized orbitals at large distances are of the van - der - waals type , with a rapid decrease as @xmath89 .",
    "moreover , there are means for numerically controlling these errors : the @xmath89 law just mentioned , e.g. , lends itself to an approximate summation of neglected two - bond increments ; energy variations between different finite clusters allow for an easy estimate of transferability defects of individual local increments .    summarizing these considerations , one may conclude that the greatest remaining error of the results , to be discussed in the next section , is due to limitation of the one - particle basis sets .",
    "applying the method of increments as described in the preceding section , we have determined correlation contributions to cohesive energies , lattice constants , and bulk moduli for all of the group iv semiconductors .",
    "the increments were always taken from the largest possible cluster ( cf .",
    "table 3 and fig .  2 ) .",
    "the correlation contributions to the cohesive energies were obtained as @xmath90 per unit cell of the diamond lattice .",
    "the results for the two different basis sets are shown in table 5 .",
    "for basis set a we obtain about 65 % of the ` experimental ' correlation energies ( defined here as the differences between the experimental cohesive energies and the corresponding hf values of sect .  2 )",
    ". the larger basis set b yields a substantial improvement , to about 85 % . combining the hf results with the correlation contributions we recover about 95 % of the experimental cohesive energies @xcite .",
    "( the experimental values in table 5 has been corrected for the phonon zero point energies @xmath91 derived from the debye model @xcite ( c : 1860 k ; si : 625 k ; ge : 360 k ; sn : 260 k ) @xcite . )    for comparison , we have also listed in table 5 results from the literature which have been obtained with other methods .",
    "the local ansatz ( la ) which also uses a cepa-0 scheme yields smaller cohesive energies for all compounds . @xcite",
    "( the la values in table 5 have been obtained by adding the correlation contributions to @xmath33 calculated in ref @xcite to the scf values of the present work ( sect .",
    "2 ) . ) our basis set a is comparable with the basis used in la , but still the correlation contributions differ by about 1 ev for si , ge and sn . lda @xcite overestimates the cohesive energies by @xmath9215 % .",
    "the qmc result @xcite for diamond is excellent and also very good for silicon ( with an accuracy of 4% ) ; note , however , that in both cases the hf cohesive energy of ref .",
    "@xcite is lower by @xmath93 ev than that of ref .",
    "@xcite and of this work .    in the next step",
    "we evaluate lattice constants ( table 6 ) .",
    "they have been determined by varying the x - x distances both in the hf and in the cepa-0 calculations . more specifically , to obtain the hf lattice constant we varied all x - x distances of the largest cluster @xmath7 and minimized the scf energy with respect to the interatomic distance .",
    "at the hf level , the lattice constant is larger than in the experiment , except for diamond .",
    "our results are in fair agreement here with the crystal scf calculations by causa and zupan @xcite : the deviations are @xmath94% for c and si , but @xmath93% for ge , see table 6 . by using pseudopotentials for the core electrons in the present work , any effects of the latter beyond the frozen - core approximation are excluded from the outset .",
    "however , calculations for small molecules show that core polarization is very important for bond lengths of ge and sn compounds @xcite .",
    "we simulated , therefore , this effect using a core polarization potential ( cpp ) @xcite and studied the influence on the x - x distance for different clusters .",
    "we find that the changes are nearly independent of the cluster size . by transfering these changes to the solid",
    "we obtain the results listed in row b ) of table 6 .",
    "the influence of core polarization is seen to significantly increase within the group si , ge and sn . valence correlations affect the lattice constant in two different ways . correlation contributions calculated with a minimal basis set ( ` inter - atomic correlations ' ) enlarge the lattice constant .",
    "the increase for diamond is mostly due to them .",
    "intra - atomic correlations , on the other hand , decrease the lattice constant ; extended basis sets with many polarization functions are needed to describe them accurately . the total influence of valence correlation seems to become less important when going from si to ge and sn .",
    "the final values are within the error bounds of the pseudopotential and cpp ( @xmath95  ) , and within the error of the limited basis set which can be roughly estimated from the difference between basis sets a and b to be @xmath96  .",
    "the la overestimates the lattice constant , since with the small basis set used in ref .",
    "@xcite the intra - atomic correlations could not be described very well .",
    "the lda yields lattice constants which are systematically too small by about 1% .",
    "the qmc result is again excellent for diamond , slightly less good for silicon , but still reaching the experimental value within their error bounds .    as a last property",
    ", we consider the bulk modulus @xmath97 , which describes the response of the solid to a homogeneous pressure .",
    "for the diamond structure one can easily derive the following expression @xmath98 we evaluate the bulk modulus at the experimental lattice constant @xmath3 , so that the second term in ( [ bulk ] ) is small but not zero .",
    "we obtain the hf bulk modulus again from the largest possible cluster . compared with experiment @xcite ( see table 7 )",
    "all values are too high .",
    "the core - polarization effect has been taken from smaller clusters , which causes an uncertainty of about 3 % , but the total effect of the cpp is much greater so that one can justify this approximation : for sn , it reduces b by 14 % .",
    "valence correlation reduces the bulk modulus , too , especially for ge .",
    "overall , we obtain results for the bulk modulus which are a little too small but still within few percents of the experimental data .",
    "we have determined ground state properties ( cohesive energy , lattice constant and bulk modulus ) of group iv semiconductors , both at the hf and the cepa-0 levels .",
    "the hf results have been obtained using a cluster method and an energy - partitioning ansatz which works well for solids with covalent bonds as those considered here .",
    "electronic correlations at the cepa-0 level are described with the method of local intra- and inter - bond increments , which allows for a systematic improvement of accuracy towards the fully correlated solid - state limit .",
    "the results show that this method works well for all solids with diamond structure , with the transferability only slightly deteriorating down the fourth column of the periodic table .",
    "not only the cohesive energy e@xmath99 , but also the lattice constant @xmath3 , and the bulk modulus @xmath4 , have been calculated with quantum chemical accuracy , to about 5% for e@xmath100 , 0.5% for @xmath3 , and 3% for @xmath4 .",
    "work is underway in our laboratory to apply the methods presented in this paper to solids with zinkblende structure , such as gaas .",
